{"text":"It was quite busy for a mid week evening. I was shocked actually - all the tables were full, and there were people waiting for seats.  Only one server was working and the chef was by herself cooking everything for the restaurant, so it was quite chaotic. We forgave them when the server brought over something we did not order. It was similar enough so we kept it (shrimp tempura vs veggie tempura).  After the rush, the service did improve. You can tell they were stressed back in the kitchen.   I came here with a large group and we decided to share about 10 dishes among all of us. Really liked the bibimbap! The complementary side dishes was nothing special. But what did stand out was the green pancake/crepe they sent over. So good we ended up ordering another!    Prices are very reasonable and include tax."}
{"text":"I walked in this restaurant upon reading almost all positive reviews here, and yet, to my surprise, this is the worst Korean food I've ever had. And I've been to A LOT of Korean restaurants in North America and Asia.  Not sure what went wrong... maybe the chef was having a bad day? The Bibimbap I ordered was essentially cold and hard rice with very sad looking vegetables randomly thrown on top of it. The mushrooms were still hard. There was no taste even with the chilli paste. and the portion wasn't worth $7.5. I literally had a better Bibimbap meal inflight with Korean Air!!!  Although, the service was very good. The waiter was friendly and fast.   Would not return to this one when there are so many other options just steps away on the strip."}
{"text":"I usually use my credit card so having to spend more than $20 to use it here kinda sucks. However, when I take a friend out or feel like pigging out myself, It's a GREAT place to eat. The food's great and the service isn't half bad. They're nice and welcoming. Took my little sister there and we both agree that it's a great place with great food."}
{"text":"Good food and nice service, good for late nights as well, open until midnight, decent amount of side dishes."}
{"text":"Yummy completely lives up to it's name. It's my go-to restaurant to head to whenever I'm in Koreatown. The food is amazing while being cheap and there's quite a variety of choices on the menu. You get a lot of sidedishes and they always give you a potato pancake on the house. My personal favourites are the bulgogi, bibimbap, and dukbokki. They're very well-known for their pork bone soup as well, quite a few of my friends never order anything else haha. The servings are on the larger side if you're not used to eating large portions. But it's great for big groups that are into sharing. Most of the dishes are under $10 so check it out if you're on a budget but don't want to sacrifice great quality. You won't be disappointed I promise!"}
{"text":"Just moved into little Korea, and this place is one of the best Korean restaurants I've tried so far. Great portion size, complimentary aps, and very reasonably priced. They also do take out and are open pretty late. The food is delicious, just wish I wouldn't have to fight people for a table. They make the most amazing pancakes, and the bulgogi is to die for."}
{"text":"Reasonable and delicious. Born soup is one of the best dishes I've had in Toronto. I visited this restaurant twice and  staffs are kind and always smile. I really miss their food."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe I'm the first one to write a review for this yummy korean restaurant. Whoohoo~~ It's my great honour.  The appetizers (small dishes) provided by  the restaurants are all great! Jap chae, potatoes are great! They also give us pan-fried korean pancakes on the house.  We ordered the fried dumplings. Not too greesy as they put some waxy paper underneath to absorb most greese. Really crispy, and definitely home-made.  I ordered the spicy rice cakes with korean ramen noodles....yum...not too spicy but definitely a good kick in the sauce. My buddy ordered the beef ribs (kalbi) dinner. Lots of ribs for the price we paid and the food is really yuuuuuummmmmmm.  Only 3 people working in the kitchen, but the food still comes out quick. I hope they can hire more staff in the kitchen as it gets busier at a later time. And you can tell, they put good efforts in their food.  The service is great. The server check on us every some time. Great experience. :) I was debating..whether I should keep this place to myself and my friends. I don't think a lot of people know about this place yet. I don't exactly know when did this restaurant open but they still have the \"Grand opening\" sign on their window. Finally...I am generous enough and decided to share this place with everyone on Yelp after my second visit to this place. :)"}
{"text":"I go here weekly with my girlfriends, such a great little place with the greatest food at the best prices! You can feast for less than $10 per person and come out feeling extremely full, ready to go into a food coma!"}
{"text":"So good and so cheap!! We were in the area late one night and dropped by here for a quick dinner. The inside of the restaurant looks bare and minimally furnished, but looks aren't everything!   We ordered pork bone stew and soy bean stew (with beef and tofu), and both were really delicious. I was surprised that at 6.95, they give large and meaty pork bones!   Service was friendly and prompt. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my FAV. Korean place. I have been going here for years, and every time I am blown away by the food.   This is why I love the place:   1)Food is fresh, and the taste is amazing. (Side note: the washrooms are very clean, which tends to mean that if the owners care about the cleanliness of the washrooms, that also most likely means the kitchen is kept super clean).   2)The food is super inexpensive. ++ The tax is included in the price, translation = you better leave a really awesome tip!  3)The side dishes are so tasty, esp. the green crepe thing, and kimchi.  4) I have visited lots of the Korean places around this area (and Finch), this is still by far my fav. to go to, both in terms of taste of the main dishes + side dishes.   5) Service is always  friendly.   Bottom line, when I am in the area, there is no other place I go to."}
{"text":"I was starving and came based on yelp reviews,  wasn't dissapointed. I had the seafood Pancake with rice cake.  It was good,  not too oily or dry.  Also had the bibimbap with beef.  It was lukewarm and the rice hard. The flavor was alright,  it wasn't the best I've had but for the price it's pretty stellar.  Also had six side dishes and a small bowl of miso soup which was nice. Came to $17 with tax and tip and plenty of left overs.  Food came quickly but the service could do with more polish.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Don't let the low prices fool you. The food is good.  I came here on a Sunday, around 5:30pm. The place was packed, so we knew we had made a good choice.   We got seafood pancake (a full plate of pancake with veggies and seafood; $6.50), bibim naengmyun (spicy cold noodle; I think it was $7.50) and spicy kimchi pork stir fry (this dish is served with a bowl of rice on the side; this was around $9).  They also gave 6 appetizers (aka \"banchan\").   We were full and the food was good. My only complaint is, nothing was actually spicy, and all the spicy things are actually quite sweet and barely spicy. But I understand that they have to please the masses. I guess you could ask for extra spicy if you really needed it (not that it said that on the menu or anything).  Also, the service was quite good. Friendly, and quick.  The place was busy, both when we came and exited, so it must be quite popular. The washroom was actually not bad."}
{"text":"good portions, nice flavors, and can't complain about pricing.  Atmosphere a bit lacking, but would recommend!"}
{"text":"i'm still a huge huge fan of this place. nothing has really changed since my last review, but as yummy's Number One Fan, there are a couple of missing menu items i just thought i'd jot down:  - makgeolli (sadface! the soju is reasonably priced for a restaurant at $11, though) - jjajjangmyeon (super sadface! my best friend and i have been craving it for a while now)  in other news, the past three or four times i've been here, we've gotten those cute little green rice pancakes on the house. not sure if it's because they're starting to recognize my face and see me bringing new people in all the time (??), or because i come in with groups of 4 or more. i'd ask why but i also don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth...   (it might be because sometimes i accidentally calculate tax as well as tip so i'm actually like double tipping ahahaaa. no big, i love this place.  another capture of pricing: last night my group of 4 got 4 main dishes, 2 appetizers, plus the green thing on the side and the total came to $44.75.)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for the first time and neither of us had the greatest experience. The place was fairly clean and packed with white people - we didn't notice until we entered the restaurant and by that time it was too rude to walk out. Sorry to be stereotypical but when you enter a Korean restaurant with no Korean customers, it's usually a bad omen.   The food came out awfully slow though I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt because the place was somewhat packed (again with Caucasians). Things started to turn for the worse when my friend's bibimbap arrived in which it came with NO SAUCE. It was just plain rice with standard topping. We had to ask the waitress twice before we got the sauce.   Next came the 6 side dishes. The kimchi was neither sour nor spicy - it was literally plain cabbage with red sauce over. There was this green pancake as well which was pretty cool but was too greasy. The only good dishes were the potatoes and the fermented cucumbers. The rest were too ordinary to make a lasting impression. In terms of refilling, the waitress refilled it but very unwillingly. She only took 2 of the 6 empty dishes to refill and did I mention she flung the dishes when she brought it back? Rude.   My dish came way later and was personally brought by one of the cooks from the back. She was courteous and nice so I wont hold the lateness of the food against her. However, the food in itself was awful. I ordered spicy seafood udon soup and what I got was spicy water with miscellaneous stuff thrown in. The seafood was neither fresh or abundant and the colour of the soup was scarily artificial red.   Overall, I give the place a two. I might come again to give it a second chance given that it is relatively cheap and they included the tax in their price. However there are other Korean restaurants down the strip that offer better food at a similar price point. Like I said earlier, a Korean restaurant full of Caucasians will only get you Korean food catered towards Caucasians."}
{"text":"Great place to sit for a bite of Korean food at a reasonable price. Service is quick and each table gets a complimentary set of 6 appetizers - delicious but keep in mind this will be filling your belly up too! I had the stir fried rice with shrimp and veges: it was savory but steer clear if you don't like pepper! My boyfriend had the sirloin marinated in the sweet and spicy sauce with zucchinis which was great. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place was good but not quite as spicy as I usually like. To be fair, I did not get a spicy dish, but my boyfriend who does not usually like spicy had to add extra sauce to his bibimbap. For me this did not really take away from the experience, but it was something I noticed (with the kimchi as well).   The place itself was small, but everything as nicely spaced out and was very cozy. Their menu is fairly extensive and the prices were good, largely in the $9-$12 range.   I got a don katsu. It was really crisp and delicious. This place also came with the most side dishes I've ever seen at Korean restaurant, though like I said before the kimchi wasn't as spicy as I usually like.   The service was prompt and we barely struck up a new conversation before he came back with our food.   The atmosphere was fairly casual and friendly. It seems like a fairly frequent choice for the students in the area to come hang out and have a good meal together.   Overall, I think it's a nice place with good food. If you prefer milder spice levels, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My favorites here are the BBQ eel, pork bone stew, potato pancakes and the rice with beef in the egg pancake. Yummy indeed! Food, staff and prices are excellent. I come back often."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is always crowded during the lunch time. I ordered rice cake. It was delicious. rice cake from another Korean restaurant has no taste except spicy. This rice cake is really yummy. They offer many side dishes. I love the green pancake."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Korean restaurant whenever I'm in Ktown. Tax is already included in their prices while other Korean restaurants have the same price as theirs but without tax. Other than their cheap prices and awesome service, eating here always makes me feel at home. I LOVE their pork bone soup and I think the price is the cheapest in comparison to all the other Korean restaurants I've been to. I also love how they give you pancake on the house when you bring a group of four or more! I've been here countless of times and no other Korean restaurant can ever top them off. (/^^)/"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the price is incredible!  Even the small side dishes were all good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Service is always very fast. Appetizer comes out right after you order and your food comes out at most 5 minutes within ordering. I usually get the pork bone soup or kimchi stew and they are always really good. Price is probably the cheapest in Korean town. They also gave my table a korean pancake and dumplings on the house!!"}
{"text":"Yummy is a charming small Korean restaurant at old Korean town.  It serves many typical Korean items and the price is very reasonable, it also helps that the price is tax included.  Tried my favour Korean stew gamjatang.  Although you can choose your spice level, I personally find regular spicy is little bit too mild and I think next time I will request extra spicy.  To food itself, for the price you get 6 side dishes which is decent, and the taste is decent but I would say Lim Ga Ne nearby tastes better.  But I am glad I found this place because a lot of time I just want a simple lunch with decent price, and Yummy delivers that.  I will definitely visit again and try other items in near future."}
{"text":"I would say, this place is becoming one of my Korean favourite restaurant for lunch. The price and service brings me here. I always have Korean Pork Bone Soup at this place and always enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Cheap and cheerful, super friendly service, and excellent food. The sweet and spicy beef is to die for. All my friends love it!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend their Pork Bone Soup and any of their Korean Pancakes! You have the option to choose your own spicy level from mild to very spicy for pork bone soup.  The menu is tax included. My brother and I had two pork bone soups and one kimchi seafood pancake (great portions, we could not finish), and a pop,  bill came to only $25 including tip!  Great service as well! Will visit again."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious and cheap. The restaurant definitely lives up to its name!  This place has quickly become a favourite for my partner and I. Don't let the lime green walls stop you from trying it, it is truly a hidden gem. I've tried many of their dishes, my favourites being the soontofu jjigae, pork bone soup, dduk bokki, and budae jjigae. I have never had a bad dish here! The portions are generous, the service is great - it's no wonder that the place is often packed. I also thanked God when I found out they deliver (rather rare for Korean restaurants). What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while so a friend and I went and got the jolmyeon (spicy cold noodle) and seafood pancake.  Now, I've eaten at a ton of Korean restaurants in the area and this was the BEST seafood pancake I have ever had. It's my new place just because how amazing it tasted. Lots of seafood you could clearly see, crispy, not too greasy.. just all around YUMMY!  The cold noodles were good as well. They served SIX side dishes, pancake, glass noodle, kimchi, kimchi pickles, marinated potatoes and bean sprout salad. ALL AMAZING! The kimchi was one of the better kimchi's I've tried, more on the fermented side.  Our total was $13.5 minus tip. Also, all prices listed include tax already! I'll definitely be going back because the food is so, so yummy. Their name holds true to their food!!  There was one waitress working who was very nice, service was good; prompt.  It'd be nice if they had a tv or some music but with good company those are things I can live without.  **UPDATE**: Went back a few times and the food quality has gone down, as a result so has my rating."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap price. the place is a little small though."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been there. I arrived at around 3PM still lots of people here. I ordered hot pot bibimbap with spicy chicken, it is so good! Maybe the best bibimbap I have ever tried in downtown. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service has been slow the few times I have been there to the point I thought they forgot my order.  My companion both times received their dish before mine.  I ordered the bulgogi with rice the first time.  Half of the dish was rice which I could not finish and the other half was beef.  Beef was tasty.  The second time I went I tried the chicken stew in hot stone pot.  I thought it didn't have much chicken and it was more of a soup.  Otherwise good quantity overall for the price.  My companions both times could not finish their dishes (hot stone pot bibimbap and  a noodle soup) and thought they were okay except too much rice in the bibimbap."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been there several times. Told people about it. I usually go for the seafood pancake and pork bulgogi. Have tried other dishes but these two are my go to. The prices point are unbeatable. Fast service!"}
{"text":"Open late and the food was good.. The glass noodles were super tasty.. Food service was a little slow, but the good taste and large portion size made up for the wait.. The spicy chicken looked good and will be next on the list of items to try when I go for round 2"}
{"text":"Really hit the spot after a day of movies at TIFF. Didn't read reviews first. Just walked along Bloor and it looked, smelled and was priced right. While it isn't cook at your table BBQ, the dishes were fresh, delicious and the right level of heat. The glass noodle appetizer they give you is delicious as a meal on its own. Glad I happened upon it."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite Korean places in Koreatown. I say \"our\" because a group of my friends always go here. The food is simply amazing, especially compared to how cheap it is. Usually about 6 of us go together and we rarely go over $50. The staff is very sweet too and tend to work really hard to keep us happy. The place is pretty small so everything is nice and intimate.   My recommendation is their sweet and spicy chicken (try it with siracha sauce). Also my friends recommend their beef and squid hot plate (don't know the name).  Will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Food was good...until we noticed some weird texture of kimchi in the kimchi. I took the suspicious piece and washed it out in my broth...and it was a piece of RAW CHICKEN!  We told them about the raw chicken and they apologized and brought out more kimchi. Obviously we didn't want to eat anymore! And they didn't offer to comp our bills. I get that it's a low-cost mom and pop shop, but no one should have to pay for a meal that they may potentially get sick from."}
{"text":"The food is greaaaaat! I love the side dishes. I got the cold noodles (mulnaengmyun) for $8.50 which came with side dishes ofc. All the items on the menu were mostly under $10 and the portions were pretty big. The restaurant is not too small but not that large. We went in the afternoon (which im guessing wasnt peak time) and it was fairly full, i wonder what it'll be like during lunch and dinner lol. anyways, the service was quick and good. the washrooms are clean. I really liked how the food is tax included. And splitting the bill went fairly good. i wll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in these two months. My favourite dishes are seafood pancake, rice cake and pork bone soup. They have SIX side dishes, and they are so delicious! Most importantly, all price on the menu are tax included! And they can accept credit cards. This is the best Korean food restaurant in the same price range i've been to. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just went to this place for the first time and was not disappointed. The service was friendly and the food came out pretty fast.  I got the bibimbap with spicy chicken(11) and my girlfriend got the rice and spicy chicken bulgogi.(7.50) We also got 10 dumplings ( 5 chicken / 5 beef) .  The total bill came to 23.50  which is amazing considering the food portions.  and they also got sides for my dish though i do not know the names of them the potato was amazing.  I would definitely go here. They also serve alcohol ($ 4 for domestic )  . Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Yummy a few times. The food is average at best but it was worth going due to the low-cost. However my last time here in 2015 really soured my experience. I ordered their Pork Bone Soup and halfway into my meal I find a GIANT bug in my soup! I asked the server to take it away.  Despite the nasty insect, they still asked me to pay for the meal! I felt bad for the server because she said her manager would deduct her pay if I didn't pay for the meal - despite it being the fault of the cook! Who does that?  Never come here again because a) they couldn't care less if there was an insect in your food and b) they punish the server for the fault of the chef."}
{"text":"I come here at least 3-4 times a month! Food is always amazing! The restaurant is always full, so do expect some waiting on weekends.  I usually order the kapoongi and spicy rice cakes with bulgogi, but their dumplings and pancakes are also delicious!  If you're looking for Korean food that's cheap and delicious, this is the place!!! The menu is huge so there's always something for everyone."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new Korean restaurant in the area apart from our usual places. We came across this small restaurant around Bloor and Bathurst. It is very small and quite tight. They offer all the typical Korean dishes that any Korean restaurant would offer on Bloor. The prices were some of the cheapest I have ever seen.  With these cheaper prices, I expected smaller portions and/or mediocre quality, but this was not the case. My stir fry glass noodles with beef and my girlfriend's kamjatang (pork bone soup) were both great. Definitely a fan and coming back."}
{"text":"Went there for take out and i was not disappointed. Cheap eat + genrius portions are always winner for me in the art of choosing a restaurant but i was happily surprised for my first experience.The lady at the cash was very nice and the decor was perfect for a small family run business. Glad to bring back these memories to my own city"}
{"text":"Despite having been to almost all korean restaurants downtown and a few in North York, this place had the most delicious korean dishes and is absolutely the most affordable one as well. Unlimited side dish ordering, definitely check this place out if you're looking for cheap but tasty korean food!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal.  My wife and I dined here on a Saturday night for the first time. Service was friendly and prompt, with a pitcher of water provided per table. The food came out hot and delicious. My wife ordered pork bone stew (= pork bone soup) which had generous portions of pork bones with tender meat; I ordered cold soup noodles which was refreshing. The table appetizers were well-portioned as well.  Prices include tax -- a very nice gesture by management. Washrooms were very clean and decor was simple but functional.  Would definitely recommend and come here again."}
{"text":"This place is fairly small and the interior is really simple, nothing fancy. But the quality of the food here is pretty awesome. Prices are cheap too.  What's not to love?  Try the pancake and labokki :D"}
{"text":"Food 2.5/5 (50% of final grade) My friends ordered a dolsot bap, savoury potato pancake, and kimchi fried rice. I ordered a ddebokki and tofu dumpling soup. As per standard for all Korean restaurants, our food came with many nice little side dishes. It actually took me a while to remember what was ordered (partly because I am incredibly forgetful), because the food simply wasn't particularly impressive. It was normal Korean food... If you crave a simple taste of normal Korean food, this is the place for you! But, if you're looking for something especially delectable, look somewhere else.  Ambience 2.5/5 (15% of final grade) It was squished and GREEN (my favourite colour everywhere else, but as the colour of walls of this particular restaurant it simply didn't work for me). The humidity and lack of air conditioning also made the general feel of the restaurant sticky--though the tables and chairs were clean enough. However, the place wasn't particularly run-down. If anything, I see potential in it becoming a cozy hang-out for many residents in the area. The heat was a major turn-off factor though. If the temperature was more regulated, perhaps the green walls would have complemented a more refreshing room temperature.  Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) Our server was very friendly! Smiles all around--this guy was obviously enthusiastic about the food they serve. Although we had to ask for more water at one point, they were very quick with replacing our water jug. When we stepped in, some of the staff were eating with their children, but she still quickly interrupted her meal to seat us--that was nice, how she didn't have us wait until the other staff came around.   Cost 3/5 (10% of final grade) For average-quality food, the price was more than fair. Not exactly what I would call a \"Cheap-eat\", because a meal would still cost you a tenner, easy, with tips and tax, but this is definitely a place you can revisit a few times without breaking your piggy bank.  Brownie Points 2/5 (10% of final grade) I would have given another point here, if the restaurant had stronger AC--my friends and I were almost melting in there. The two points, however, are for the service. I know I mentioned it already, but I just wanted to put it here again--I love eating in the presence of happy people and happy staff!  Final Grade = 53/100 = 3 stars  TLDR: This establishment is at par. Most likely won't be coming back though, because there were many other catchier restaurants around. Service was nice, but the food was simply ... NORMAL. Not a place for a date, more like a semi-rundown-but-not-actually-rundown place for a light, late night drink with friends and more affordable comfort food."}
{"text":"Food is good! Considering how little you pay and how much you get (you get more than enough; believe me!) I'd say this restaurant is worth a try, for sure!"}
{"text":"really low price. the price on the menu seems to include tax already. they offers many banchan and you can even get free refills."}
{"text":"Came here because of the cheap soju and good reviews on yelp - left with a huge disdain to never come back because of the horrible owners and horrible service.   We came here seeing that the soju was 11.5 a bottle on the sign in the windows as they advertised. All the menus we had said the same price too. We wanted a fun night with cheap drinks followed by karaoke. The place even gave us dumplings on the house so we got pretty happy. Then they tried to make us pay 16.5 for a bottle of soju when advertised it should be five bucks cheaper.   The owners started yelling at us showing us that there were some menus that showed a line over the 11.5 price and showing us some sheets how much they paid for soju and how we had to pay 16 for a bottle when they had misadvertised it on the window as cheaper. We were calmly saying that we weren't going to pay an additional 20$ for our bottle while they got some random Koreans to translate for us saying that \"too bad you have to pay more\"  I ended up reading a government of Canada law for them on my phone regarding misleading advertising and left with a horrible image to never come back here. Never.  If you come here be warned that their menu may not be updated and they can charge you whatever they want and try to get away with it."}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp and I'm glad I did.  It is one of my favourite food korean places in ktown.  The food is fresh, simple , flavourful, YUMMY and the prices are good.   When I first came here, I had an excellent experience. The waitress greeted me with a big smile saying: welcome. Also, I only waited 10-15 minutes for my food, which was really quick. Since that day, It became my go to korean food places in ktown.  Overall, I love this place."}
{"text":"Totally delicious and a great price - so happy we tried this place! Walking by one night, we saw that it was packed even though all the nearby places were mostly empty. We were not disappointed! Although the decor and tables and cutlery aren't the nicest, who cares when the food is amazing?? For 2 people we ordered a potato pancake, sweet and spicy chicken, and hot stone bibimbap with spicy pork. Came out piping hot, great flavours and big portions! Happy to take home enough leftovers for another full meal."}
{"text":"Found this little gem while my SO and I were looking for a snack before our park venture. Glad we decided to sit down! This place is amazing! The ban Chan was sooooo delicious, they served us this seaweed side dish that we both weren't a fan of but it could be that its just not for us. We ordered the spicy pork bulgogi and chicken katsu. The pork was served on a hot plate, it was the right amount of spice (I'm Hispanic so I like and can handle real spice), and I liked the combination of onions and cabbage the pork was cooked in. The katsu came with a small cold refreshing cabbage salad. The katsu itself was delicious, the chicken wasn't fatty AND it was perfectly crispy! Overall the experience was great, we loved the food! We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Favourite kfood in ktown! Great food, good service and all at the most affordable price in Korea town"}
{"text":"Great little casual joint for a quick and filling lunch or dinner. More than four side dishes were served at the same time as the main dishes and everything was fresh and delicious. We chose bulgogi on a cast iron plate, bibimbap in a bowl, pork bone soup, and seafood kimchi pancake. A vegetarian friend ordered veg chapchae, but this came with shredded cabbage instead of spinach, which is not as nutritious. Everything was warm and delicious, prices were super reasonable, service friendly, and clean bathrooms :)"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I typically do not write reviews but this experience was so horrible that that I just had to.   Food quality and portions have gone down significantly. Not sure if ownership has changed but I come here religiously, at least twice a month. They now serve half of what their portions used to be. Everything is drenched in oil and less flavourful. Not sure if this is a one off but everyone in our party had stomach aches when we finished dinner.   What made this experience extra terrible is that the waitress forgot to hand in our order and we ended up waiting an hour for our food. Tables were coming, eating, and leaving before we got anything. In that hour, no one came to check up on us. After an hour, we approached the waitress and she found our order sitting on the side of the counter. Even after knowing we have been waiting so long, she didn't come bring the free apps that they offer with the meal.   When we received the bill, we asked if any discount can be applied as we had to wait so long. The owner came out to talk to us. I explained the situation and explained that we were loyal customers, he replied that if we were loyal customers we wouldn't be asking for a discount. He kept saying sorry but then would go on to say that an hour wait isn't even long during their rush hour hours (As mentioned, I'm a religious customer and I've only ever had to wait 25 mins max even when their restaurant was slammed). He started yelling at me and I even had to say not to raise his voice at me as I didn't want to argue further. He ended up giving us a $5 discount but made it clear he was really upset about offering us a discount.   Stay far away from here. This restaurant has fallen off. Plenty of other Korean gems on Bloor st."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a standard Korean restaurant.  They have very good side dishes, but they were smaller portioned.  We were not asked if we wanted more banchan.  However, we automatically got more water.  We tried the spicy bulgogi and a soon tofu.  Good, but not woah, 5 star worthy.    Bonus:  the taxes are included in the price.    3.5 stars?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently changed management but menu and prices are the same. It's still worth it to come for a quick cheap meal. However, everything has become a bit saltier and some of the new servers don't seem to know what they're doing or give you attitude. There also a couple flies buzzing around as you eat."}
{"text":"Only on koreatown can you find domestic and imported beer for 3.50-4 dollars. Wow. And the lunch specials starting at 10 dollars. For big portions can't complain! Right near Christie subway it's a definite spot to pop by and try! Now can do cash and debit for payment which is solid. Service here is polite and fast. Has a very casual atmosphere, perfect for takeout or a quick bite after hitting up any of the multiple bars in this neighbs. They plAy loud k pop throughout day mAking for an upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good Korean, Really quite quick service and delicious Bim Um Bap"}
{"text":"Yessss I love an authentic budget eatery. Totally no frills & pretty tiny, this is some of the best Korean I've had in ages. The free side dishes are plentiful (we had at least 6) & were asked if we wanted more after we scoffed those down.  We ordered dumplings (vege - delicious), spicy beef bulgolgi with rice cakes (two different types of rice cake plus potato noodles) & hot stone bibimbap with pork bulgolgi. Everything was so delicious that I burned my mouth trying to eat it & the total came to under $30 minus tip but including a couple of drinks. All prices include tax.  Get to this place stat, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I ordered the beef bibimbap. Very fresh and tasty, well seasoned and flavourful. The place is small and there is usually a bit of a wait, but worth it. The pancakes are great too, not too oily. The sides are better than others I have had at other Korean restaurants. I think this place is my new fave. Delicious kimchi and glass noodle sides! Yummy indeed!"}
{"text":"(2.5*)  I absolutely HATE the green in this restaurant because it kills my eyes and the server that night gave rally bad vibes but their gamjatang makes up for it for only $7.   Upon entering me and my frend wanted to sit by one of the larger tables but the server was really rude about us choosing to do so saying \"No don't sit there that is table for 5\" and it's like 10:30 p.m. !?!??? I bet my entire life savings a group that big is NOT going to walk in and need those EXACT seats. Well whatever, but he didn't have to be so rude about it.  We ordered Ribs, Gamjatang (Pork Bone Soup), and Rice Cake & Fish Cake Ramyun and our side dishes like never came out before our dishes like literaly EVERY KOREAN PLACE IVE BEEN TO does, except this one of course. So we were starving for a solid 20-25 minutes with only water  Gamjatang (7/5) Damn this dish was a homerun because the broth was so flavourful and the meat literally fell off the bone as soon as I touched it with my chopsticks. This is a must get anytime of the day, anyday.  Ribs (3/5) Kind of oily? It wasn't grilled I'm 100% sure because the last few bottom pieces were just KINDA DRIPPING with oil and there were no grill marks at all. Meh, decent flavour but would rather just go down the street towards christie station for better ribs.  Rice cake & Fish cake Ramyun (1/5) THIS PLATE HAD LIKE 5 SLICES OF RICE CAKE AND 3 SLICES OF FISHCAKE ARE YOU JOKING. Only upside was that the ramyun was cooked perfectly thats it. This plate was actually a waste of money. If I wanted ramyun like this it would've costed be a solid dollar at CPAT.  Verdict: Only ever coming back here for the gamjatang, after the two misses from the other two dishes and complaints from other reviews about how ordinairy the bibimbap is, not willing to risk the other fails they might have up their sleeve. Glad I found a good gamajatang place tho."}
{"text":"For a lot of food for under $10, this place can't be beat. With delicious Korean sides and flavorful food and prompt service, this is a great place for cheap eats with friends. There's a card payment minimum of $20 so come hungry or bring cash. I personally got full less than half way through my glass noodle and vegetables dish and she said she could bring more sides if I wanted."}
{"text":"Service was surprisingly disappointing. I came with a group of 5 and server did not come to check up on us even once after being seated. We had to wait quite a bit to get their attention which the other server mainly stayed in the already-crowded kitchen with chefs. Only ONE person understood English yet they still got our orders incorrectly. I asked for extra rice cake for my spicy rice cake dish so I can share with my friends (i said ill pay the extra fee) but they brought out the plate that looked only 3/4 full.. I then reminded that the server I wanted the extra rice cake and they agreed but ten minutes later, I had finished the plate.. so being frustrated, I called over the server to cancel but they told me that they had already cancelled it before I even cancelled.. I will definitely not recommend this location. My friends were also disappointed and we just left as soon as we could."}
{"text":"Jan 28th/014   The food is \"SCRUMPTIOUS\" mouthwatering, we have discovered this restaurant about 6 months ago when they just opened, we come once a week.  The service is excellent, the waiter very polite.  The Bulgogi Bim Bim Bap is the best tasting ever!  The owner is the Chef and very kind, always gives a dish of pancake or soup.  I highly recommend this restaurant !  5 STARS"}
{"text":"Amazing. Went here for the first time after trying a few other known restaurants in the city - the food here is excellent.   We had the spicy rice cakes, bulging beef with squid and kimchi, tofu stew with seafood, and bibimbap with spicy chicken.   Staff is friendly and keeps an eye out for you.   The place is casual - perfect for most nights out.   And the prices include taxes! What more could you ask for.   We'll be going back ASAP; I need to try their pork bone soup."}
{"text":"My go to korean resturant! Cheap food and friendly staff. Make sure to come before 7 if you don't want to wait for the dinner rush!"}
{"text":"The food is great. There's no doubt about that. However... I just found a strand of hair in my bibimbap. Gross."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a good place to go for cheap Korean food. Its not the greatest, but for the convenience and price, food was pretty good. I ordered the tangsooyook and my husband ordered the nengmyun. The tangsooyook was ok in terms of flavour and meat to batter ratio. This dish is usually made with pork or beef, but here they make it with chicken. This is the first time I've had it with chicken and I wasn't a fan. A couple pieces were still a little raw inside and the flavour is just not the same. It tastes best with pork. Also, the batter was a little too soft for me. My husband's nengmyun which is the cold noodle was pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but just good. I would rather pay a little more and get better Korean food from a bunch of the other places down the street, but if you're on a budget, this place has tons of options to fill your Korean food cravings."}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo and went up to visit and eat some good korean food with a friend.   Last time i remember, some places took American cards like Visa, Mastercard, etc. So once we entered this restaurant, i asked the lady, loud and clear if they accept American credit/debit cards. She said yes. We ordered and the food was good! Although i found it really odd that we can to take our own orders on a sheet and they take it. Side dishes were bit more catered to American tastes instead of true Korean side dishes.  Once we were done, we went up and gave my card for payment. She said they don't take it and it needs a chip in the card. Well, if you told me that in the first place, i would've taken cash out of ATM and ate. I told her that i asked as soon as i sat down and she insisted she never said that.   If you mistakenly said something, i expect the business professionalism and apologize for the mistake, and i would've gladly paid cash and be on my way.   Needs to work on customer service in this restaurant big time."}
{"text":"Their pork bone soup is awesome!! The price is competitive too. Definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"Will echo the other posts which is to say, this place is yummy and DIRT CHEAP!  My brother and I feasted on three dishes and the banchan (better than most places out there) and walked out very full, for less than $25 all in...  Now, none of the dishes were exceptional, and maybe their menu is too big, but you KNOW it's for real when you see the ajima in the kitchen working away at preparing your food.  It reminded me of the mom and pop smaller restos in Seoul (but they usually specialized in particular items), when I lived there for a year back in the mid-90s...  Can't give it five stars, but good, honest food for a MORE than decent price..."}
{"text":"pretty cheap korean place.  the veg options are all over the menu - there is a glass noodle dish, and soft tofu stew, and fried rice with veggies and bibimbap and other stuff to satisfy vegetarian's hunger=) all dishes (veg ones) range from $6.50 to $9 - cheap! and yummy!  the coolest thing about the place is that they refill the appetizers (all these korean apeptizers you get before your dish - kimchie etc) as many times as you ask them for! deal! love it=)   the service is great too! I complained out loud that my dish is delayed not really meaning to be heard by the staff but they did take a note of that and brought a whole basked of chicken dumplings as a \"sorry for the delay\" not that I could eat these but this was a very very appreciated sign of acknowledgment.  good place to check when you're hungry, on a budget and in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and got the kimchi fried rice with chicken in a hot stone pot, and unlike the udong soup with pork cutlet, it was delicious! It came out super hot and the rice was perfectly cooked and fried with a healthy amount of kimchi and chicken. My friend was craving the green pancakes and she got her helping! This visit was better than the last."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent. I enjoyed their food a lot. The portion is big enough to fill me up as well. The prices are super awesome and affordable.   Their pricing comes with taxes already and I believe the range for dishes were $7-9 flat. Tip is additional of course.   Must try if you're in the area but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Management has changed so it's only fair to make another review. The menu and food is the same (a bit oilier) however service is awful. New staff are not very friendly and don't bother checking up on how you're food is or how you're doing. They're too busy talking to each other to acknowledge customers attempting to flag them down. Our table, along with others went up to the cashier to request for things like sides, another order if something and even the bill."}
{"text":"This place is yummy!  Ordered the seafood pancake, fried squid and veggies on hot plate and some noodle soup.  The soup was merely ok but the rest of the dishes were tasty.  They give you 6 different banchan to go with it as well which Is quite generous.  Great prices and quick service.  Come here when you want comfort food!  Looks line a poplar hangout for students...."}
{"text":"Great. Love the lavish banchan spread, friendly service, and unwaveringly viridescent paint job. The portions are a little smaller than at, say, Tofu Village - but the prices are too, so I think it comes out pretty even.  The rice cakes ($7) are tasty and they are able to turn the spicy sauce to a sweet one for infants/me (you can then use the table hot sauce to adjust to your preferences).  My sole complaint is that only the original (beef) dolsot bibimbap comes with an egg which, as you may know from my Korean restaurant review history, is one of my bibimpet peeves. Egg for everyone! We! Want! Egg! WE! WANT! EGG! But we went with the shrimp bibimbap ($10) and, eggless though it was, I still enjoyed it.  Will definitely be back to try some pancakes and tofu."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of korean food and this is one of my go-to korean restaurants. This place is authentic, clean, and very inexpensive. I love their many side dishes - especially the potatoes and green pancake. If you ever want more, they are able to refill any or all of the sides.   I always order seafood tofu stew, omurice or kimchi fried rice and many of my friends usually get bulgogi or spicy squid with rice. Overall, dishes are amazing for the price!"}
{"text":"We stumbled in here on a weekend, after desperately over-booking our day and simply needing a place to kick back, grab a beer and stuff our bellies with good food before our next adventure, and Yummy Korean Restaurant fit that bill.  Do you know how many of the restaurants in Koreatown have all these happy pictures on the outside, of chefs presenting their food or smiling? This is one of those places where the person pictured is ACTUALLY the chef! That was the first good sign.  I ordered one of the Korean ramen soups, spicy with fish cakes and it was exactly just what I needed. I washed it down with a beer which was about $3 and my bill came to about $12 with tip! The small plates were super tasty and the waitress offered to refill any of them at no extra charge.  The place is decorated like a very simple cafeteria, nary a decoration to be seen, but everything is clean and efficient. If you want a quick, cheap, filling dinner in this neighbourhood, you cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Really good food, not excessively spiced, rich in favour. Also nice staff when I visit alone."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean food restaurant in Toronto! I fell in love with it after the first time I went there. Those girls are really nice. The food are so delicious and the prices are very fair. They provide many different choices even for one type of food. I also love the environment, the green walls make me feel comfortable and cheerful. I will absolutely go back there again when I come to Toronto next time. It's an absolute yummy place~"}
{"text":"The restaurant name couldn't be anymore accurate; it's a yummy Korean food restaurant  This is my go to Korean restaurant because the service is wonderful and the food is consistently good. The side dishes are pretty tasty and I usually get the spicy pork stone pot bibimbap. Prices are pretty competitive and affordable for the portions that you get compared to other Korean restaurants in Korea town."}
{"text":"Despite there being at least 5 of these Korean restaurants in extremely close proximity to each other (Hey, we're in Ktown!), I may or may not have chosen this place based on the name.   Prices are extremely fair and food is authentic. My friend and I both ordered the fried egg bibimbap and a seafood pancake to share. Both came out quickly. See, you can't really mess up bibimbap but the pancake is one of the better ones I've had in recent memory.   Yummy isn't cozy per se, but it is comfortable and reminds me a lot of my time in Korea. more mom and pops store and no frills. I will definitely return to try the seolleongtang and soondubu!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who was trying Korean food for the first time. We were planning on going to Korean Village but I decided to try this place out due to the good reviews on Yelp and their cheap prices.  FOOD: I would have to say I'm slightly disappointed by their food. Mainly because it was mediocre and the spicy dishes were not spicy at all. It was good enough for my friend who doesn't eat spicy but that's about it. I ordered her a bulgogi with rice, I got a yukgaejang (spicy beef soup), and I also ordered a kampongi to share. She enjoyed her bulgogi but I felt the spice was definitely lacking in the other two dishes.  SERVICE: The servers here do not speak English well so be prepared to explain what you need thoroughly. Besides that their service was good and food was quick.   This place has the cheapest prices on Korean food hands down. All the prices listed have taxes included! I would definitely come back to try some other dishes but I really wish their food was actually spicy."}
{"text":"This is the go to for cheap and delicious Korean food. Everytime I come here, I leave satisfied and bloated haha. They give you large portions and the service is good. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"\"Let's go to yummy! \" This is the only place I want to go to when I'm craving korean food, especially in koreatown. I normally get bulgogi dishes and my favorites are #42 or #43- both at the price of $7.95 with tax already included (all food items) Now their side dishes, oh man. Tell me a place that has potato pancakes as side dishes because I can't name another one around this area. Also, when you ask for more, they don't cheap out. Most places do, limiting you to only kimchi or radish. This place demonstrates consistency based on the amount of times I've been there and still remains my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on October 13. My friends and I HAD to have Korean food the day we were seeing Big Bang live at ACC.  The place was dead when we walked in around 2pm. The waitress was quick to give us menus and take our orders. I had dolsot bibimbap which was standard and as delicious as expected. My friends had kimchi fried rice and fried pork in sweet&sour sauce. They both enjoyed their meals. We shared a kimchi seafood pancake which was warm and soft. We were also impressed by the 6 side dishes that were provided along with our meals. Most place we'd been too before only server 4 or 5 side dishes.  Very good, cosy Korean restaurant. Will return next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The food is good and cheap, and the portions are quite large. There are also some decent vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Pretty cheap food, got #33, jap udon with seafood and seaweed ($7.95). Pretty big bowl, soft noodles, LOTS of seaweed, squid, clams etc. I found the soup tasty but really salty after a while. Their condiments are nicely varied"}
{"text":"For the portion size, its pretty good price. You could also ask for more side dishes as well which is really nice of them. The service is nice and the food is good as well. I ate the kimchi fried rice which is okay for people who like spice and are okay with handling spice. I also had the non-spicy tteokbokki that was good as well. I got the non-spicy version because I know I wouldn't be able to handle eating all of the tteokbokki. the sauce of the spicy tteokbokki is pretty good so you should get some mandu/dumplings to dip into the sauce. I had a pretty good experience so far and its nice ow they let you sit there even after your done eating. They don't rush you to finish which is nice! You could also ask for more sides."}
{"text":"Yummy's is my all the time favourite go-to restaurant. I have been a reoccurring customer for over 3 years now. First found this gem in the heart of Korea town while going to a high school in the area. (All credit goes to my friend for suggesting it)  Although service might be a little sloppy when it gets busy at night, especially Friday evenings, the food and price point make up for it. Now korean food is on my top 3 cuisines, and trust me I've had my fair share korean food. Yummy's Pork bone soup is one of the best, as well as their Dubbokki. These two staples of Korean cuisine are both at a staggering price of 6.95, the cheapest price I've ever seen anywhere. Portion size, taste, everything is there. That's not to exclude other items are their menu. For example their Stone bowl bimbimbap or Kimchi fried rice should not be disregarded. Everything you see on the menu is around 3-4 dollars cheaper than any other place. Not only is their menu good, but their side dishes are amazing. They have the largest selection of side dishes, coming at 6: potatoes, korean pancake, spicy pickled radish, kimchi, japchae, and bean sprouts. Most people love the potato side dish the most. With the unlimited refills, its almost a dream come true.  One flaw in recent years, is their addition to add a minimum $20 fee to use the debit machine. However their prices are so low, this flaw is small enough to be exempt.  Overall super amazing place, if you're in the area definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Owner and kitchen staff are Chinese. Can also tell from general mannerisms. One server is Korean.  Good food for the price."}
{"text":"Yummy restaurant has been my go-to korean restaurant for the past few years! We eat here almost every week. High recommend their spicy bulgogi/squid/pork, omurice, kimchi chigae and all their side dishes. Not a big fan of their sweet and sour pork, too sour to my liking. They get really busy sometimes but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant for me in Toronto. I live in New York City now, and I miss this place a lot. The owner lady was always so sweet. She was the cook as well. Generous portions, great side dishes, and amazing service. I've tried a lot of things in the menu but my favorites are their gamja tang, seafood pancake, and fried dumplings.  I miss you YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I feel like I should be the judge of whether it is Yummy rather than being told by the restaurant name that it is Yummy. Is it just me? Yes? Just me? OK then.  Well it wasn't really as Yummy as the name suggests. The dumplings were pretty good when hot, but they were not the kind of dumplings I have been spoiled by over on Spadina and near Spadina. They're fried dumplings, but not really the Chinese kind, more like the kind you'd expect on an appetizers menu at a bar, if bars did dumplings.  After cooling down they went from pretty good, to bad and awful. If I went back here, it would not be for the dumplings, but the lovely service and exciting looking menu mean that I'll stick with a 4 for now. Next time, I'll try some of the Korean food I actually know I love, especially if they have Yuk Gae Jang.  Maybe that can be Yummy Yummy in my tummy. Oh sh** I sound like Guy Fieri."}
{"text":"After hearing good things from my friends, I decided to try it out. Had a very satisfying meal that was well worth the money! Make sure to go early on Friday nights or else you'd have to wait in line outside. My friend and I went at 6pm and got a seat without waiting. I'm glad that even though there was a line when we left, they didn't rush us to leave. I ordered a kimchi stew with tofu and pork and my friend ordered their kimchi fried rice. We both found that the kimchi made both our dishes pretty sour. We shared a rabokki dish and it was pretty delicious. It's a small store so the spacing is tight. Other than that it was a good experience and will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Definitely the cheapest Korean restaurant in K-town, with a pork bone soup going for just under $7. Two of my friends and I ordered a seafood kimchi pancake and a ramyun rice cake to share and I got a plate of rice with beef and squid.   The pancake was good but slightly too thin for my liking and was mostly kimchi and not very generous in seafood. The ramyun rice cake was 90% ramyun, and the rice cakes were in the sliced form instead of the tubes (is this how it is normally?). The sauce was also a bit too sweet for my liking. My plate of squid and beef was a bit too oily for my liking but tasted pretty good.   It is worth mentioning that portions were HUGE and side dishes were a plenty.   At the very end, as I was paying, I was surprised to hear the cooks talk in Chinese in the back. Turns out that this place is a Chinese own Korean restaurant but hey, that doesn't stop the food from being yummy and cheap!"}
{"text":"I guess that saying of you get what you paid for really applies to this location."}
{"text":"From the outside and inside this place looks pretty average if not worse. If it wasn't for the great reviews I've heard I don't think I would have ate here. But the reviews were right on. Great food for sooooo little.  The beef pot and fried dumpling were awesome. couldn't believe the price. So cheap."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant!  The side dishes are delicious (especially the green pancakes) and so is their Hot Stone Bibimbop and dumplings! The prices are very reasonable and the food has always been very good every time I have gone.  The servers are polite and always ready to help you. The interior isn't fancy (lime green walls), so I wouldn't go there on a first date but it delivers on food, service, and price."}
{"text":"If you are looking for yummy kfood while on a budget, I totally recommend this place as a contender.   Went on a Saturday night around 6-7pm and it was packed. Had to wait 10 minutes for a table and saw ppl waiting even longer after I arrived. I had the #56 - spicy bulgogi and squid on hot plate for $10.95, while my friend had the #66 - KamJa Tang, pork bone soup for $6.95.   For my dish, I asked if it can be mild but I thought it was pretty spicy. It was good, but it was so salty and spicy that I basically gulped down 1 whole water jug. I would probably go for the regular bulgogi on hot plate next time. As for my friend, they wanted no spice as it was an option on menu. But beware if you order #66, staff said they cannot do no spice but mild at best. The pork bone soup was quite generous in portion though, had about 3-4 big pieces of meat and some potatoes. I tried a little and found the meat tender.   The side dishes also had a lot in variety, offerings pancake, kimchi, radish kimchi, sweet potato, glass noddles, and cooked bean sprouts. I loved the pancake and sweet potato especially! Definitely would return considering the great price point, side dishes and portions."}
{"text":"Small restaurant. Not too clean. No decor.  The prices were good. Stuff friendly. The food in general was ok.  The seafood pancake was very good and so were the steamed and fried beef dumplings. The hot stone bibimbap with shrimp was okay, only 5 small shrimps but enough of rice and vegetables. Same with the pork one, not much meat but enough of rice and vegetables."}
{"text":"The name says it all. Yummy was quite yummy.  They have a huge menu with your typical Korean dishes.   Expect the side dish portions to be on the smaller side. My favourite was the potato and left me wanting more.  For the main I got the kimchi pork and tofu stew. There was a generous amount of meat and tofu. The stew was also not too spicy and catered to my liking.  Solid meal for under $10."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood, looking for a spot to eat. I am new to the city so I am not familiar with the streets or local places to eat so I hit up Yelp a lot. This time it led me to yummy korean, the name seemed interesting and it is rated very high so i took a shot.  A family run korean place, it is spacious than a lot of others on the street. it was almost past lunch hour on a friday and still the place had a decent number of patrons. The beautiful smell of the korean spices and warmth of home kitchen welcome you.  I was seated close to the entrance for a party of one and handed over an extensive menu and a pen and paper to put down my order. I decided on the potato pancakes and kimchi and spicy pork. As i waited for my meal, 6 side dishes were presented, beans, glass noodles, marinated raddish, sweet potatoes, kimchi and rice. The glass noodles were delicious and iwas hungry so i gorged on them till the main course arrived.  The pork and kimchi arrived next sizzling and quite the portion. As I was settling in with my food the pancakes arrived as well.   PORK and KIMCHI: spicy and sour the kimchi blended well with the pork, it was delicious, like comfort food. I loved it all of it. I polished it as i dipped the pancake in the mix as well.   POTATO PANCAKES: Good side with the pork, they were bland and slightly burned but with the pork they seemed just fine.   People with small appetites these two dishes would have sufficed. I took the pancakes home almost all if it. And it came to slightly over $20 and which was fine. It is good for large groups the food is good and so is the seating.   The people are very courtwous and warm, they dont accept cards below $20 so if you are goimg alone, be sure to carry aome cash."}
{"text":"best korean food i ever had,and the price is so friendly.will recommend to my firends"}
{"text":"Whenever my friends and I want korean food, this place is always our go to. The prices are cheap, the portions are big, and the food tastes amazing - what more can you ask for? The restaurant itself is pretty casual, somewhat run down, but in my opinion that just adds to the charm.   My favourite items to order are the bibimbap, sweet and sour chicken, chicken cutlet, potato pancake, and deep fried dumplings. Is that a long list? Yes. My point is that you honestly can't go wrong with this place, everything tastes amazing and none of my friends have ever had a single complaint.   And also the side dishes are really good too!! Especially the potatoes and the small green pancakes, I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place.   Just make sure you bring some cash when you come here because they don't accept card payments under a certain amount (I think $20?), but guys this place is worth the trip to the ATM - trust me."}
{"text":"Had a stretch of disappointment in Korea town, Yummy was a nice surprise! #49 spicy chicken, fantastic and good price.  More than half the tables not cleared, need to improve cleanliness.. Kitchen very dumpy looking."}
{"text":"first time in here, i tried the seafood kimchi soup(?) i think i forgot about the actual name, but it's number 78 on the menu. It was nice, although I kinda expected more seafood such as shrimp and squid. But I'm pretty much satisfied with it!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean place in Toronto plus it's extremely good value. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was so good. All the prices are tax included, really cheap for such delicious Korean food.  It was clean and not very crowded for every table. Staff were friendly and easy to talk. There was empty when my friend and I came there for lunch but after a while, just after we ordering our dishes, the restaurant was totally full of people. It seemed very popular. My friend's Kimchi beef soup was amazing!!! The sour, sweet and salty of kimchi made the soup tasted fresh and appetizing. My vegetable korean noodle was delicious too. It looked very light and the noodle was not instant, very health and good taste. And their side dishes were all very YUMMY!! Especially the stewed potato, kimchi and vegetable noodles.  Be cautious to their washroom's door, it was very tight and would close instantly and automatically. I had my hand hurt... So painful... But it was not their fault. Yummy is a good restaurant to recommend."}
{"text":"This no-frills Mom and Pop place just blew me away!  Excellent steamed pork chive dumplings - to their bibimbop - and their bulgogi - we will definitely come back!  Quick service and reasonable prices - the pics I will post should say more than my words!"}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised that I haven't reviewed this place. I've been here maybe about a dozen times or so in the past year plus and it's definitely my go-to whenever I am craving standard Korean food.  Let's be realistic here, this is not exactly an impressive place to take your date to and isn't going to blow your mind with any extraordinary dishes. But whatever standard fare they offer, it's pretty damn good! And with prices from the 90s... how can you go wrong?  The staples like gamjatang, kalbi, bulgogi, seafood pancakes, soon tofu...and many many more are done very well. All the dishes are unique in their own way and jam packed with flavours. Even the freebie appetizers are all pretty darn good. There's a reason this place is always packed and to be in this part of town for so many years, their food game has to be strong.  Are there better tasting Korean restaurants out there? Yeah! But for the convenience and price you pay here, I would say these guys have overachieved in every single category. Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best place in the area for Korean food. Me and my friend were both amazed by how good the food was. Also, the reasonable price is another thing that made us decide to come back for sure. I has been wondering why this restaurant is always crowded. Now I understood why. Highly recommended for Korean food. I wish they had jajangmyeon and kimbap 'cause those are my fav ones lol"}
{"text":"Yummy is my fav go-to korean restaurant! The food is soo good and cheap too! They give you so much side dish and always a pancake on the house :) I come here so many times (I often forget to check in) Have celebrated so many birthdays here too. The food is awesome and the owner lady that works there is always nice and says hi even though she's always busy in the kitchen hehe. Would def recommend this place to anyone.. I have brought so many people and all of them have fell in love with this place. Def check it out :)"}
{"text":"After attending a wrestling show down the street we ended up taking a walk to find some food and that walk led us right to Yummy Korean! This place has a pretty detailed photo menu right on the front window that let's you see pretty much everything they got just by walking by! (this clearly worked since it drew us in) What drew me in was the kimchi rice with chicken, it's something I've actually never had but after seeing the table next to ours order it I knew I had to taste it for myself! The gentleman working seemed pretty busy and stressed but he was also very helpful and friendly when we were there. What's super awesome about this place is that when you order a meal they actually bring you multiple side dishes to go with it like different forms of kimchi, these little potatoes (I think that's what they were), and even these little green crepes (again, I think that's what they were) and they were all really good! The kimchi rise is served with chicken and even has a fried egg on top! The entire dish was absolutely delicious and was way more then I ever could of expected. Places like Yummy Korean make me want to only eat at small restaurants sometimes, this was such an awesome experience that I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Family run Korean place that is open late. Its a no-frills place, that just dishes out tasty Korean food."}
{"text":"Extremely authentic food for the best price in a good area. Plenty of food to eat. A bit on the salty side, which isn't necessary for taste.  I liked everything I tried."}
{"text":"I found a hair in my food after I ate a considerable amount. I asked for the bill and asked for a small discount for this experience. Two staff members denied my request. I only asked for the extra egg not to be charged which was $1.00. They couldn't even provide a small gesture. They responded that THIS HAPPENS. Hair is not suppose to be in food. Period. Out of principal I am never going back."}
{"text":"Very homely atmosphere and super affordable!  Yummy is my favourite Korean restaurant and their side dishes are just delicious. This is one of the few places that serve honey garlic potatoes, which I can get never get enough of! There is a jug of water that is placed on the table so that you don't have to constantly call over the waiter or waitress to refill your cup. The place is always reasonably busy, but there is always a seat available so you don't have to wait to be seated. I ordered the Chicken Katsu and the sesame sauce on top of the katsu was very refreshing. The portion is a bit big as they give you a lot of chicken. A downside is that the place does not accept debit unless your total is over $20. So make sure to bring cash if you ever decide to eat here!"}
{"text":"I was able to try the spicy squid bulgogi and the chicken pan fried dumplings. Both were very tasty.  The spicy squid bulgogoi was surprisingly tender and had nice pieces of squid dispersed in the bulgogi. The chicken dumplings were all home made and tasted great.  The pricing isn't that expensive either. It is worth trying this place if you enjoy Korean food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time 2 weeks ago, we ordered pajeon and tang soo yuk. Prices had taxes added already which is great. Store was very vibrant due to the green paint but it wasn't so in your face. Waiter was great. I was just kinda upset that an extra bowl of rice cost $2. Banchan was interesting especially the mung bean pancake? (the green pancake). Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Finally! Found the perfect Korean restaurant. Greeted from the second we walked in. The place was very busy and was expecting a bit of a wait. Thankfully a table opened up immediately and was sat down quickly.   The hostess very prompt in her service and ensured that we had both tea and water at the table.   Ordered the pan fried veggie dumplings, tofu bibimbop and the pork bones soup. Without getting into too much detail, the portion size was huge and the flavours were spot on.   The pan fried dumpling were amazing. The Crispin was and flavours were absolutely perfect.   This place is my new go to Korean in Korea time!"}
{"text":"I have been here before but was with a large group for tonight. We messed up an order and had to order again because they didn't take back the one that we unintentionally put in the order list but they gave us a pancake for free (though I think they gave it to everyone else too..) but anywho, overall experience was nice. I was a bit disappointed with the stir fry pork though. The stir fry chicken was good. Might go again when I visit Toronto again. (But I like my Chicago Korean restaurants better )"}
{"text":"One of my favorite comfort food Korean restaurants. We only ever order Kamjatang when we're here but it hits the spot every single time. The soup comes piping hot and with 3 large pork bones, well seasoned and fall-off-the-bone tender. The side dishes that come with are also delicious, especially the green coloured pancakes and the honey potatoes. We make the trek here even in the bitter cold just for a cheap, filling but hearty meal. Did I mention their prices are tax in already? This is a winner in my books."}
{"text":"MUST TRY -  spicy bulgogi with seafood (hot plate)  Other recommendations: - pan fried dumplings - bibimbap  Side dishes are excellent. including kim chi, sprouts, glass noodles, potatoes, etc. sometimes pancake  Super affordable  Service is attentive, though they can get very busy. It's wise to pay at the counter.  90% of the tables can see into the kitchen, which helps to ensure cleanliness and quality preparation."}
{"text":"I had the broiled eel on rice with teriyaki sauce (or something like that) and my friend had the hot stone bibimbap with shrimp. Both were $9.95. The eel was really good but once I finished it all I had left was rice with teriyaki sauce, basically. My friends bibimbap was good according to her, and with all the little sides that come with it (e.g. potatos, kimchi, glass noodles) I find it's very worth the price. The place isn't amazing appearance-wise and I wouldn't say it's the greatest Korean food, though. It is yummy, though, just as their name claims!"}
{"text":"have been eating here a lot of time. the food is delicious especially the pork bone soup ( KamJaTang) which is my must order each time we went there. my partner like their bulgogi bibimbap. the service is okay when it's not too much customer. sometimes it's busy at lunch/ dinner time but the food comes out not more than 20minute from taking our order. we like that they give us take out box when we have ordered too much and have some leftover."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!  I have been a loyal customer here. But yesterday, I came with 2 vegeterians and we requested not to put seafood in their pancake. They accidentally put a squid in and when we requested to change it, they refused. We though that there were a lot of squid inside so when we saw a squid, I ate eat right away so my friends wouldn't feel disgusted. They said that if we cannot show the squid, they won't change. They said we cheated them. What for?! We wanted that dishes and we just requested to change another one, not a different dish. Furthermore, when we requested to refill the side dishes, the Korean girl refused and she said \"I know you won't tip so I won't refill\". What's that attitude?  Very disappointed. Don't come here they treat the guests like garbage."}
{"text":"Seriously don't look around for a better Korean food on area. One of the best . No MSG and headache  And it's truly yummy .friendly staff and reasonable price.  Been here 3 times and will definitely  come back"}
{"text":"It was really delicious. Nothing but good food with great people. It was really late when the hub and I went but they accommodated us and served us well. Food was good, service was good. I'd go back for more the next time I stop over Toronto."}
{"text":"I feel that I'd be doing this place a disservice if I didn't do an update - as I find myself craving Famous Lady bulgogi at least once (if not twice) a week. Yesterday's dinner was #41. I always mean to eat half and take the rest to go, but, well, it tastes SOOO good! Service is fast, food is fresh, cheap and good. Always clean and organized. I may have to go back again today!"}
{"text":"This place is, in fact, very Yummy. Inexpensive and with a long list of menu items - great for groups who are pro-sharing. The spicy pork bibimbap was amazing and so were the beef dumplings, and that plus a beer still rang me up around $10.   The staff is nice. Sort of funnily adamant about the use of the little paper order sheets for everything but I get it, especially when there are possible language issues adding to the game of broken telephone between multiple young waiters and the glorious dictator mama in the kitchen.   The room is lime green and brightly lit. This alone would keep me from coming here some days when something more dim and soothing is required.  And Man sidenote but I wish we had a proper Koreatown in Montreal with rows of different kinds of cuisine and options like they have in Toronto. I love my Korean places in Montreal, don't get me wrong, I'm just jealous of the greater bounty. That is all."}
{"text":"This restaurant has above average service, minimalist decor, and most importantly; great food.   We ordered a stew, a rice cake dish, and a noodle dish. The side dishes were tasty. We didn't order any drinks, but soju was a reasonable price of around $14.  We had enough leftovers for lunch the next day and still spent less than $30. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great Korean restaurant to curb any Korean food craving. Came here a little before 11 on a Sunday and they were already open. It smelled a little like bleach but I assumed it was because they were just getting ready in the morning. It dissipated and we stopped noticing it shortly after sitting down. We ordered the kalbi BBQ and the kimchi soup (#68). The service was very slow and it always took a while to get the waiters attention since she wasn't hanging out up front.   The side dishes were all spot on and they served all the dishes that I love including bean sprouts, potatoes, kimchi and glass noodles. The new dish that I have never seen before is this green starchy pancake like dish that was so good. The kalbi was really fatty but had a good taste. The kimchi soup was a good taste and had a lot of ingredients inside including cuts of beef. They also served us hot barley tea when we asked for hot water which was really a nice surprise. Overall this place does what it needs when a craving kicks."}
{"text":"The price is great, I go often with my significant other.  Here's a run down of what we like and what personally recommend.   Get the bottle of soju, its cheap and it helps set the tone. Get the rice Cake platter, I like to share this between my Girlfriend and I. Then really any of the following, Pork Bone Soup, Bibimbap, and bulgogi.     And then your good to go! most of the time the bill comes out to under $40"}
{"text":"I've been here at least ten times. There's a reason it's always busy here. The prices are low and the food is delicious! The spicy rice cake here is my favourite, as is the pork bone soup! The side dishes are amazing, too. The service was surprisingly quick on Family Day considering they constantly had a line-up going out the door. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Chronological review: wash rooms were very clean and extraordinarily bright as is the entire small restaurant. Beer was warm-ish. Food service efficient and very fast.  Had the stone pot with pork. Good and good sides too. extraordinarily cheap meal and warm beer - 14 bucks All in.  Certainly not dining - more like fast decent food."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and doesn't hurt your wallet + the servers there tonight were super sweet. I asked for quite a few refills of the side dishes and the server just chuckled and brought refills of everything back to the table.   The portions are decent and it's definitely a great place to go with friends if you're in the area. The bright green walls were a little too exciting for my taste haha but it's a great place overall!"}
{"text":"Note before reading: I pretty much handle anything I touch with care (note I am a baker).   I ordered take-out and I walked from the restaurant (boxes upright) all the way to Bathurst station. When I got to Yonge/Bloor station i was  but the bottom of the plastic bag. There goes 1/3 of the food - the sauce which mixed with rice is EVERYTHING.   For $8 I probably shouldn't complain, so I'd rather make a kind suggestion to the restaurant. For your saucy-dishes, put the non-rice food into a soup container to preserve your food.  Pretty disappointed.   For a dollar more ($9+Tax) you can get 1.5x the size of this portion for the same meal at Sunrise house (south side of Bloor closer to PAT supermarket)  You learn from your mistakes I guess. I just wanted to try this place for the first time cuz I heard it has the same food as my usual go-to korean restaurant, Sunrise but it was slightly cheaper."}
{"text":"We waited for a long time for our food, and almost no attention from the waitress. Looked like they were spending a lot more time prepping takeouts and deliveries than attending to the customers in the restaurant. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for cheap eats and quick service. I am under no pretense that the ambiance will be great, or service particularly friendly, but it's quick and fresh!  We ordered the chicken is sweet and sour sauce (I will not try to write Korean phonetics here), the rice with egg on top and the boiled dumplings. The sweet and sour thing was amazing, freshly fried and not over battered with a great sauce. The rice thing had A LOT of ketchup on it, but the fried rice was good, and the egg was really thin. The boiled dumplings tasted like the frozen ones you can get from a store, but they were still yummy.   They came out with a lot of the little korean side dishes, and they were all good too. I will definitely be back to try the rest of their offerings...and the sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and we were customers for a while until trying to order delivery. When we called the delivery number, the guy said to text the order and that they only take cash. Half an hour after texting the order, we text again to see what the status is. He calls back saying he missed a call and asking what we want. We tell him we texted the order, but he says they're too busy and it could be a 2 hr wait time. Why didn't he say that during the first call?? He sees the text now but clearly doesn't want to take the delivery and we ask him if it's possible to get the food within 30 or 45 min. He says he can try for 45 min but no guarantees. What terrible service. He's now telling us our food needs to be put on the list? We said don't bother.  They shouldn't  have a \"delivery\" menu if they can't handle delivery orders. They clearly don't have the capacity. Won't be eating here again - there are other options in the area."}
{"text":"Wrong order came no refunds or new dish. No room at all, tight space.  Had to eat what came, unsatisfactory"}
{"text":"Very good Korean food! Tasty, great portions and so cheaply priced.  Don't get fooled by the neon green walls, you will have a great meal.  Casual but pleasant service."}
{"text":"Really good meal at a very reasonable price.  3 of us ordered: 1. Spicy beef bulgogi and squid - not that spicy..next time I would go for more traditional beef bulgogi 2. Seafood pancake - really tasty and generous amount of seafood 3. Pork bone soup - incredibly tender, fall-off-the-bone pork. A bit of work to get the meat off, but definitely worth it 4. Bibimbap - delicious With one beer and 2 soft drinks, the total came to around $45.  Don't be deceived by the decor.  The food is better than the place looks."}
{"text":"Included tip but no break down. Partly my fault but very sneaky of them as well. Service was adequate"}
{"text":"Think I just ordered the wrong things.  The ramen rice cake dish I had was watery, not spicy enough, and bit on the sweet side.  And I hated that it only had cabbage slices tossed in them.  All of 5 cents probably.  Look at the picture, it doesn't look that appetizing.  And the rice cake bulgogi glass noodle dish my friend got was much more spicier.  I don't get it.  And I hate that the food I ordered came out in Corningware plates.  I personally hate them.  They're so ugly and nothing about it screams I'm eating a Korean meal.    I also hated that they just bring out whatever is made whenever they feel like it.  I got my ramen dish first, then 8-9 min later, my friend got his rice cake noodle dish, then when we were almost done, we got our kimchi rice cake pancakes.  I didn't want to eat my dinner backwards.  Nor stare at my dish for 8-9 min while waiting for my friend's dish to arrive.  I've ordered take out before coming into eat here and even though I ordered 2 entrees, it came with such little side dishes, we ran out 1/3 way into our dinner.  And my spicy pork was swimming in red oil on the bottom of the foil.  Taste was good nonetheless.  I've noticed that their side dishes differ from table to table.  Who knows why.  At least everybody got 6 each.  And I assumed there were no refills because they didn't ask us if we wanted more.  All the other dishes people posted and were eating around me looked decent except ours.  I had a sad dinner.  Poor me."}
{"text":"Decent spot for Korean food in the heart of Koreatown. Side dishes were good, pork bone soup was good, and pretty cheap. Restaurant is pretty clean and well lit."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp and suggested it to my friends based on the favourable reviews. The food was good, the prices were good, and the food came out fast. It's not a fancy restaurant by any stretch, but we had an overall good experience.  I like that their kimchi pancakes were crispy! Good, long menu as well."}
{"text":"The food was really good when I first had it, and really, the price couldn't be beat. Can't find a 6.95 pork bone soup anywhere nowadays! The bibimbap was still sizzling when it came out- very large portion and lots of vegetables! The seafood pancake was good though I think next time I'll get one without kimchi- I didn't like that every few bites of the pancake, I'd randomly get a sour piece of kimchi, didn't think it paired well though it was definitely interesting and different to try. The reason i bumped it down from 4 star to 3 is that since about an hour after my meal I have been extremely thirsty and my tongue feels dry- not sure if its lots of msg in some dishes??  Service was so-so as we were seated around the corner and had to get up and approach the front counter ourselves. However they were very friendly. Watch out for your bill, they undercharged us by almost $9 so I can imagine that they may make many mistakes when it comes to that."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp, my friend and I decided to check it out.   I ordered Pork Kimchi stew and Beef Ribs. I can never get enough of the stew and always want to come back just for it. The ribs are amazing. My friend is pretty picky when it comes to food but he liked it! The kimchi will be better if it's sour, and the clear noodle is a bit dry.   I came back a few times and brought different friends with me so they can try it out and they all love Yummy.  The space is small but not suffocated. I always feel calm and relax here with their green wall and cheap but good quality food. The server is pretty friendly.  My go to Korean restaurant !"}
{"text":"Ordered two spicy tofu soups and a Korean pancake with seafood and bill came out to 23 bucks and change + tip. Can't beat that price. Came with 6 delicious side dishes and the tofu soups were in larger bowls (the ones used for pork bone soup) than other Korean restaurants use so bonus!"}
{"text":"Trekked down to Koreatown on a Sunday night to find some soondubu jjigae without seafood, and this restaurant met my needs! I ordered the soondubu jjigae with beef. Service was prompt and friendly and the food was great for the price. I wish I would've brought more friends so I could've ordered more! Definitely will return next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"A great surprise! Doesn't look like too much from the outside, but everything exceeded my expectations!  They give 6 side dishes, all of which tasted amazing! I've also tried numerous dishes here including their spicy pork bulgogi, their spicy pork bone soup, and their fried beef dumplings :) and they all were really good. The pork bones came apart very easily, the meat was really soft and came off easy as well :)! Very pleased!  Also, all of their menu prices have tax included already :D how convenient!"}
{"text":"love this place.. its our go to Korean food joint. Favs are kimchi and pork stew, seafood pancake, dumplings, kimchi fried rice and spicy bulgogi."}
{"text":"I come here way too often. Great service, beyond delicious korean food and amazing prices. If you buy a lot food they even give pancakes on service, and the side dishes change with seasons.  The restaurant does not look like a high end interior, but trust me you won't regret entering. Korean food craving? This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite Korean restaurant in Toronto, and I've tried many!  food portions? great food prices? excellent - they're both fair and sometimes even cheaper than other places! (for a long while their kalbi was $11-12!) food taste? excellent! side dishes? MY FAV combination!!  service? great - humble and unassuming (they don't give me+boyfriend a fork just because he's white, unlike some other places) location? steps away from Spadina station, with interesting stores all around and even a walk away from UofT!"}
{"text":"Delicous!  Green bean pancake = yummy!  Vegetable and seafood pancake = delicious!  Kalbi = all day every day!  Just be sure to bring Canadian cash.  Their debit card machine was down and with U.S. cash, you lose the benefit of the conversion.  But I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"We had been to Korean Village a few nights ago and it was on point, and then we ventured into Yummy which is perfection.  I will admit, the ambiance is lacking, and it's a bit odd to have to place your order on that piece of paper, but who cares. Do yourself a favor and start with the pan fried chicken dumpling. I had no idea dumplings could be this good.  And then get the simple stone bowl - I got the shrimp - I've never had a stone bowl quite like this, one that tasted of pure freshness, the slightly sweet rice, the grilled shrimp, the perfectly fresh spinach and bean sprouts.  We also got a tongue burningly spicy chicken dish which came all red and with the kind of heat that sneaks up on you only after you have swallowed.  Extra points for delicious banchan, big bottles of water  delivered to your table when you arrive, and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We came Sunday evening and the place is packed. But we were able to get a table for 2 immediately.  The price is really good and affordable esp the taxes are already included. We ordered bulgogi, pork bone soup and steam beef dumplings. It was ok nothing special. Large serving for a price!  we ordered 2 beers too I think it was $4 each. Really cheap. The staffs were friendly!"}
{"text":"Despite all the other Korean restaurants in the area, I decided to try here due to high Yelp reviews.   Good things first.  -Service: excellent, and attentive.   -Price: Cheap  Not so good things. -Food: Ordered Spicy Bulgogi dish which I almost always get when I go to Korean restaurants. -This one lacks flavours, and toppings. No glass noodles, no rice cakes, just meat and veggies (few carrots and green onions). Not spicy at all.  -Side dishes: Usually comes out before the main dish, but here it came out at the same time as the main dish. Mediocre taste, nothing  good or bad to mention about.   I also noticed I was the only Korean there out of about 20 people.  Tip: If you want to try that country's authentic food, go to a place where they eat ;)"}
{"text":"Came here today and ordered beef ribs and pork bone soup. Food price here is better than in Scarborough. Ordered beef ribs and pork bone soup (regular spicy). Flavour is there but the pork is not fall off the bone (don't know if they took it from a new batch bec i ordered with no bean sprouts) and the beef ribs is more on fatty side. Would i come back?...i would come back for the price but I would like to explore the neighbourhood restaurant in Koreantown."}
{"text":"Yummy says it all! The food was tasty (loved the banchan dishes), the service was great, the ambiance was unpretentious and the price was kind to my wallet. What more could I ask for? Well, maybe the option to pay by credit card..."}
{"text":"The food is great! The prices are amazing!  Keep in mind it is cash or debit only for orders under 20$  There service is ok. They wait forever to bring out the side dishes, but I'd still recommend Yummy Korean because you;d be hard-pressed to find better Korean for so cheap!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and I am so happy I did. Ive been craving some spicy Korean food for awhile and I definutely got my fix. I induldged before even taking a photo because I couldn't contain my excitement but the after photo explains it all. Every thing that came out was fresh, delicious, and full of flavour. Yummy has now become my go to in Korea town."}
{"text":"If you are at koreatown and is feeling like eating something hearty and cheap, make sure to come here!  Good prices and pretty fast service"}
{"text":"Super delicious food and cheap. Lots of small side dishes with most meals (like kimchi and glass noodles). Was a little concerning that we saw a cockroach on the wall but kind of expected with the cheap prices."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant in the heart of Koreatown is pretty delicious, authentically Korean and not too expensive. The pan fried beef dumplings were yummy and fresh. My absolute favourite was the stir fried spicy bulgogi and squid with vegetables. The KamJa Tang (pork bone soup) and the spicy pork bulgogi bibimbap were also pretty good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this small restaurant on Bloor. My boyfriend and I were looking for food at 9pm on a Sunday night. Seeing that Yummy has a menu out front with photos of all the plates and it was open, it was a winner.  When we walked in we were seated right away. The menu has a ton of options to choose from. The best part being the photos of all the food. If your eyes are bigger than your stomach this is always a plus. I went with the vegetable dumpling soup. When our food came out they also brought out 5 mini plates of sides. The portions of the actual meals were huge! My soup was incredible! The sides were also very delicious. The best part was if you finished a side dish they'd just bring you more of it!  Overall, the food was very inexpensive and incredibly delicious. I will absolutely come back here."}
{"text":"Really Love their service and very nice people! Good food too! Menu already included tax and food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Toronto is fortunate enough to have such a diverse community where the choice of Chinese, Korean, Indian, Italian and many more styles of cooking are available within walking distance.  There's a wide variety when it comes to Korean cuisine. I've been to many different Korean establishments across the city but none have drawn me in the way Yummy's does. From it's cheap prices to the portions of their phenomenal food, this place is my go-to for good comfort food.  A few of my favourite dishes are the pork and beef bulgogi served on a hot plate. I usually can't choose between the two so I end up getting both. Perfect for sharing!   Korean cuisine is traditionally served with a few \"complimentary\" appetizers which consists of kimchi, daikon, bean sprouts and many more.  If you are in the area (Korea town), please do yourself a favour and check this place out!"}
{"text":"in spite of ugly green walls and no music, service is fast and nice and food is great, prices are good and include tax even!!! bibimbap was one of best I've had. will return this weekend and whenever I can!"}
{"text":"What to try?  They are known for their sweet and sour Korean fried chicken.  The chicken was tasty and unlike Chinese sweet and sour chicken, the Korean version's sauce is lighter in colour and they added some spice powder but the dish is not spicy. Chicken are not fried like nuggets but rather as strips of chicken. The dish is pretty big so you can share with at least two ppl. If you order more food, rmb you hv side dishes too!   I realized that each Korean restaurant makes their gamja tang or their porkbone soup a little bit differently. But the general ingredients are the same. I liked their porkbone soup too but it's different from other restaurants in that it did not come with potatoes. Still, a soup to have with a meal is always good!  Last tip?  Don't be afraid to order more side dishes again. It's okay to order another round of the side dishes if you really like it, but of course don't go overboard reordering the side dishes multiple times!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Angry owners that YELLED.. yes yelled.. at us when they were the ones that did not change their menu prices and also falsely advertised their drink prices on the front door. Unbelievable. I have never experienced such disgusting customer service."}
{"text":"After starving ourselves the whole day -- not intentionally of course -- we needed a tried and tested formula to resolve our hungry situation. And like a stroke of genius, we thought... KOREAN FOOD.   Yes, you know, when your minds are set on satisfying that craving, there is no way you will let that up, especially since Yummy Korean Restaurant is our go-to in Koreatown.  Even at 9pm (Sunday), this place was still brimming with folks (good indication of like-minded souls who know good stuff) and with all these hungry-for-korean-food-veterans around -- there's no way we're gonna play around and waste time.   We swiftly zeroed in on the Kimchi stew along with the Hot Stone Bibimbap with Spicy Squid and when it came -- my goodness -- it was beautiful.  Maybe we were starving but this place always works its magic whenever we need a solid, affordable place to have a meal. And with the side dishes of potato, kimchi and beansprouts acting as delicious fillers while transitioning between kimchi stew and the soft, yet, chewy spicy squid atop the crisp-ed rice dish of the bibimbap -- it was heavenly.   From where I come from, we call this whole experience -- \"shiok\" -- which means, damn good, amazinggg and divine all rolled up as one.    It was probably the best $18 (total) we spent. And afterwards we thought to ourselves, what a great way to end off the week eh? Seriously, damn shiok."}
{"text":"This place is great, especially if you're the type that wants something delicious and cheap later in the night. I had the pork bone stew ($6.95 + HST), which was great although the soup itself was a little on the salty side (so eat with rice!). The provided appetisers were nice as well.  I would definitely come back here again and try something else.   Service was decent despite how overwhelmed the single waitress seemed to be with all the people that was being served (even at 10PM at night). Props to her."}
{"text":"Nice and easy lunch place if you are looking good deals and good eats!   Came to confirm the legitimacy of such a highly rated restaurant in k-town. Casual and homey spot for decent Korean food for decent price!"}
{"text":"This place is dingy, this place is neon green, this place only takes cash and Canadian debit, but the more I think about it the more I get hungry. Five sizzling-bowl stars for Yummy, because, well, it's fucking yummy.   I'm terrible at ordering Korean food, I always trip myself up and get confused and don't end up with exactly what I want. I live in Koreatown but am extremely loyal to Buk Chang and Thumbs Up (which I confused with Yummy after a day in the sun... I guess since they're both positive attributes?), and I'm glad a friend of a friend helped show me the Yummy light.   I had the pan fried dumplings and a sizzling plate of more beef. I think it was bulgogi, but again, I suck at ordering Korean food. I'm craving these perfectly mingled flavours again right now so desperately. Looks like it'll be Yummy for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great stuff! Never really noticed this place until now. I'm a fan!  Food is excellent and at very good prices. I never had an issue with any of the menu items I ordered and I thoroughly enjoyed each one. The PORK BONE SOUP is my favourite and is about $6-7 dollars plus tax. Quite affordable. And they don't cheap out on the serving size and portion. This along with the side dishes get me full each time. For less than $10, you can get a great home style cooked soup and leave full. Good stuff. Will definitely be back."}
