{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The atmosphere is clean and fresh. The downside is it is a little difficult to get to and it's easily missed if you don't know it is there. The sandwiches and coffee are very tasty and the service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  They have a unique range of coffee drinks"}
{"text":"I love True Coffee! The coffee is great, the shop is cozy, the staff are friendly. Just wish there was an East side location!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee places. The service, atmosphere, coffee, and food are all consistently good. It's usually pleasantly quiet and not too crowded."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The pumpkin spice latte is to die for...and I love that I can get it all year long!  Atmosphere is very nice, clean & inviting.  I've met friends for coffee here and even met with business colleagues a couple of times.  Always found a place to sit.  Employees are very nice...they even deliver my espresso drink to the table.  And they also have delicious Shakeology shakes!  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They do coffee right and they do it well. Pastries, to die for. Breakfast's and lunches. Yumm. They know what they are doing. They also have an award system that is a great bonus. The only downside is I wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"I travel a LOT for my job. Something that keeps me sane is a great coffee at cool coffee shops. Normally I go for a standard black house coffee, but today I wanted a mocha and a cookie. This place delivered an excellent mocha and my chocolate chunk cookie was perfect, IMO. I don't think I'll be back to Stroughton anytime soon, but I definitely recommend this place. It's a gem for good coffee drinks :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed! Need more variety on the drink menu and more cozy sitting areas. I wish they would visit the Firefly in Oregon to get some great ideas!"}
{"text":"I come here periodically for coffee as it across the street from my doggy daycare. The coffee is good.  They used to have amazing scones but unfortunately they had to switch bakeries within the past year.

Pros - only place in Fitchburg I can find a lemon scone (don't expect Lazy Jane quality)
- They sell day old bakery if you can't quite rationalize spending full price
- They have simple syrup out for you to add to your iced drinks.  Nothing I hate more than adding a sugar packet to iced coffee.
- Dollars towards free drinks add up fast on their loyalty card

Cons - In contrast to other reviews, I have had really flaky service on numerous occasions.   Do I always come the day a new hire starts, or are they roasting something other than beans in the back? Hmmm..."}
{"text":"Our local go-to coffee shop.  We only buy our beans from True (FTO Breakfast Blend, yummmm) and an occasional latte is a great treat when I pick up my beans!  They have a great loyalty card too.  For food I've tried the breakfast burrito and yogurt parfait.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent coffee and drinks. Whenever I am around this place I have to stop. Breakfast burritos are Delish. My favorite is a chocolate croissant warmed up. It's buttery flakiness is amazing. Only hiccup is that sometimes they will mix up my drink and make it hot instead of cold. But it's an easy fix! Love True Coffee!"}
{"text":"I drove 15 minutes to come here after reading all of the positive reviews, and being a coffee roaster myself I was excited to find another potentially great cafe in Madison. 

I tried the Fair Trade Peruvian that they had brewed and was really disappointed. It was very weak and bitter, and left a rancid aftertaste like they hadn't cleaned the carafe enough. 

The employees working were extra friendly, but that didn't make up for the bad coffee. A cafe with calling itself True Coffee Roasters should make a stronger effort to serve great coffee, not diner-grade drip."}
{"text":"True Roasters on Nesbitt is one of my favorite places to go for cappuccino. The coffee used for this delectable drink is so fresh and so expertly roasted. If you need a gift for a coffee person, you really can't go wrong with a freshly roasted pound of French Roast or Sumatra!

The staff is very friendly and the coffee is amazing."}
{"text":"True Coffee is my favorite coffee shop in the Madison area! The coffee is absolutely delicious. Of all the blends they offer, the 7 Provinces blend is the best.  When I'm in the Fitchrona, my bf and I usually swing by the cafe for an iced turtle latte. Definitely worth a visit when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"A couple years have passed and things have changed. I'm still happy to get an espresso when in the area, but it's no longer a destination. Could the quality have slipped or maybe it's just that The Madison competition has vastly improved. I.e. 5th element, crescendo, Yes."}
{"text":"I used to be a Starbucks Guy, but True Coffee is in a higher league. If you are a coffee connoisseur, this is where you will get that \"Ahh that's good\" experience. It's always fresh. Food is great. Good place to get some work done. If you get beans to go, they put the date of roasting on your can of beans, not that they need to. Their discount system is great. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They had good coffee, yummy Caesar Salad, and yummy hot chocolate! Came here with my daughter and had lunch. Service was slow, but the staff was very nice and friendly. Very knowledgeable about their menu. The cashier was new, it was her fourth day, but she was really nice and friendly. I was not going to give her a hard time!!! There was plenty of seating and free WiFi. Their Caesar Salad was AMAZING!!! Very fresh and delicious! I had the Au Lait iced with Carmel flavoring in it. It was very good! I gave the four stars because they were a bit slow with the food and coffee. They were also out of spoons and my daughter couldn't eat her parfait without a spoon! But there were only 2 staff members working in the front. The cafe was very neat and clean. The decor was really nice and the ambience reminded me of, like a cool place to hang out and drink coffee. It quiet and relaxed. Anyway, I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I have not tried any food, the rating is solely on the coffee.
An excellent selection of beans from around the world that you can tell have been roasted with great attention to detail. Espresso shots are spot on. Friendly knowledge staff. The cafe is nice and sunny."}
{"text":"Very happy with my visit.  Service, coffee, cleanliness were well above par.  I couldn't find anything I didn't like about this shop."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been buying their ground coffee ever since we moved to the Verona area, and  I haven't tasted any yet that beats their flavor. We typically get it ground specifically for our cone drip coffee machine, but I also get a bag ground for a French press I have at work. The staff is always friendly, and helpful, and they all definitely seem to be very knowledgeable about their different types of coffee. 

In addition to their awesome ground coffee, the drinks they make in their cafe are delicious as well. They have a wide selection of coffee beverages, as you would expect at any coffee shop, but they also have a decent sized food menu for breakfast and lunch. I would highly recommend True Coffee Roasters to anyone in the Fitchburg or Verona area who is looking for a good cup of coffee, either at home or at a cafe."}
{"text":"Stopped in for, what else: Coffee.  Friendly folks, nice atmosphere.
Got both bean and a cup.  2-shot small latte.  No code words, total lack of pretentiousness.  Absolutely wonderful cup.  As I bumped my way down PD, I was hoping to catch each light red so I could drink more without spilling a drop.  Loyalty card for over-the-counter purchases and a can program for bean purchase.

Nice place, nice people, great coffee.  I'll make a point of stopping in regularly."}
{"text":"4 stars for coffee, 3 stars for food, settled on a 3 star overall.

I've been to True quite a few times now, and while the people are always friendly and the coffee is always good, it has always left me wanting more. The space is fairly large, so I can imagine it is a good place to come and work if you want to get out of the house. They also have a good selection of brewed coffee if you're not in the mood for a latte (which they also do pretty well). 

The one complaint I have, and it is a large one, is the food. First of all, their breakfast sandwich is outrageously expensive. It was over $7 the last time I was there! It was good, but not amazing. It's basically 2 slices of bread, some cheese, lunch meat and an egg (that doesn't look like it is cooked fresh since they don't have a griddle that I could see). I could go to Barriques and get much tastier sandwich for much less. I've also tried a Banana Chocolate Chip muffin that was just meh. The banana didn't taste real - it had that artificial sweetness to it. 

So I'll continue to come here for the coffee, but not sure if I'll try the food again."}
{"text":"This place was good coffee, tea and a sweet staff, although it did take some time getting our drinks- I wasn't so certain that we had some many people before us. Even though there was lots of air around us, the place was warm.  I really didn't find anything particularly special of this place. I will come back and see what the other options are besides coffee."}
{"text":"My dad's girlfriend and I went here to chitchat and get to know each other better and it was a great place to do just that. 

It is your average coffee shop but what makes this one different is they actually have made in house food that is TASTY! I didn't order anything too complicated, but as we were there talking, I'd hear people have these really cool nifty specialty drinks they wanted and they'd customize the drink to the person's standard--everyone seemed very happy.

They do have wifi."}
{"text":"Just an FYI ... It is no longer TRUE coffee. The new name is Malabar Coffee & Tea. I picked up a few day old scones for Sunday morning and they were pretty darned good. The fresh baked goods looked unusually over baked, almost black edges.   I did not get any coffee drinks today, maybe another time."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last week. It was good, but didn't live up to my expectations (perhaps that's my fault). I went in looking for a coffee shop that was serious about coffee roasting and exceptional preparation, and what I found was just OK. 

I first ordered a cappuccino. The proportions were great - kudos to the barista for not giving me a latte with a little foam on top. However, the espresso was underwhelming (really dark roast, kinda flat tasting) and the milk was about 200 degrees. 

I the ordered a drip coffee, and while they had three varieties to choose from, they were all dark roasts that again fell flat in flavor. Where are the bright Ethiopians? What about tossing in natural processed Costa Rica in there? Something with a little personality please. 

So, all in all, it's a decent cup of coffee. Not life changing. Set expectations accordingly."}
{"text":"Tried this coffee shop while visiting Madison.. my boyfriend and I both got a blender, he got caramel and I got no flavor. After trying his I was swooned with how amazing this coffee blender was and asked them if they'd add caramel to mine. They did no problem and it was so amazing. Just the right amount of sweet but you could still taste the espresso flavor. One of the best blenders I've ever had!! YUM"}
{"text":"Love this place, I recommend it! My favorite drink is the Coconut, Caramel & White Chocolate Latte."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee! Be sure to grab an Americano and buy a bag of coffee to take home with you.  If I lived in this area, I'd be here several times a week."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for my first visit. I came in for some coffee to accompany my time to research an upcoming trip. The space is very bright and open. Lots of seating choices including some big comfy chairs. There is a small children's play area too. There is also a patio with plenty of tables outside-though given its location, there's not much to look at. 

They offer the standard coffeehouse drink options and a decent size selection of food (breakfast sandwiches, soups, sandwiches). I didn't get anything to eat so can't speak to that but my iced coffee was excellent. And bonus-they have the liquid cane sugar stuff. Yahoo! Goes great with iced coffee to avoid the all the sugar granules sitting at the bottom of my cup problem. 

Service was quick and friendly. The tables weren't very clean and I had to clear some crumbs off the one I choose to sit at-hence the lack of five stars. Throwback 80s music of a wide variety was playing at the perfect volume. 

Great little place with excellent iced coffee. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great place for my coffee and beans. I go every 2 weeks for my coffee. If you go on Mondays' you get double the points and so I often get free coffee beans. AND THEY ARE so worth it!!! Highly recommend.  Plus the staff are also really nice..."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was killing time for an interview around the corner. I'm very please with my simple coffee. The price was decent and they had sugar cane syrup at the mixer station...bounce points. Prices are madison reasonable and the atmosphere is amazing
 Plenty of indoor and out door seating."}
{"text":"This place makes some great coffee. It is kind of a funky location but you can't hold that against them. I like their employee bios. Gives you something to do to pass the time. The only thing holding me back from a 5 star is the beverage preparation time. Although, if you compare it to Starbucks it is a wash because there isn't the long line."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff, free Wi-Fi. A really interesting selection of breakfast and lunch items. Their loyalty card is also very generous - money spent quickly adds up to free items. Good place to study or meet up with friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my first impression of True Coffee Roasters.  I am looking for a new coffee source due to continued problems with Starbucks.   I bought some of their whole bean coffee and one cup of coffee to go.   It was good and the brew at home was very good.   Sumatra and Guatemala.  Service was ok but not especially friendly.  Would it be too hard to chit chat a little at the counter?  Instead of just ringing me up why not ask if had a particular coffee I liked or recommend one that I might really enjoy.  The place doesn't seem to have that cafe feel that I am looking for.   But the coffee was good.

I went back and the whole bean coffee was pretty picked over.   Not sure if this is a good sign or not.   Staff sill asleep at the wheel.  I am going look elsewhere.   But the coffee is good.

Went back again in Sept.  Staff a little more attentive.   Bought an iced Italian coffee which was delicious."}
{"text":"I love coffee, which makes me a sucker for a great coffee shop.  The best coffee place I have ever visited is Perc Place in Hartford, WI.  Perc is the standard by which I set my scale.

What makes coffee places great:
- Great coffee, wide selection
- Friendly service
- Warm, inviting environs that just make you want to cozy up for a couple hours with a book, laptop/tablet, or some friends
- Outstanding food, especially a wide variety of baked goods

Why 2 stars?
The coffee was okay - just okay.  It really didn't make a super impression.  I was with a friend who ordered a large mug of black coffee, which he pumped from a self-service thermos.  I ordered the mocha made by the barista.  Personally, I like Starbuck's and Caribou's mocha better.

Counter staff was super nice.  The baristas were anything but the epitome of warm and fuzzy.  They crafted coffee and yelled out names.

The establishment is chock full of simple plastic chairs and small, boring fast food tables all lined up in perfect rows and columns.  None of the tables had any of the basics on them (napkins, sugar, creamer, and the like).  The atmosphere, the aesthetics - there was no reason to linger.  It communicated:  get your coffee, drink it up, and go.  The place was moderately busy.  When we arrived, most of the tables were dirty.

The food was terrible and a total deal-breaker.  I ordered 2 different kinds of biscotti.  Biscotti is double-baked and should be crunchy and flavorful.  Instead, both cookies were chewy - a big no-no with true biscotti.  Both cookies were pasty and as flavorful as cardboard.  My friend had a cookie and found it as palatable as the biscotti.  We learned that the baked goods were not made on site.

Reading previous reviews and responses about the food implies one thing to me.  Management has opted to outsource baked goods rather than make them on-site.  It appears others have complained similarly.  I read that bakers have been changed but the food problem persists.  The fact that management settles for serving poor quality baked goods is deplorable.  If I am the manager/owner, I absolutely must taste the baked goods BEFORE I purchase them.  If they are bad, I simply don't buy them to resell in my cafe.  Since this is a common complaint, this should be a focus of attention.  What befuddles me is that management seems to okay with shrugging their shoulders rather than taking action.

Bad food, bad management, mediocre coffee, unclean tables, fast-food atmosphere.  2 stars might be generous."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I love the greenberry shakeology. So yummy and I love that it's healthy. I just wish they had another location in the downtown area so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"The owners of this coffee place decided to start selling pastries that taste like cardboard about 3 months ago.
It doesn't seem they are going back to the great products they had before so I have to update my review and rating accordingly.

Still great coffee thought..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times my sister and I ordered coffee drinks. I ordered an iced latte and she had a flavored coffee. Both were perfect. Exactly the way we ordered. No complaints. The barista was very friendly, helpful and funny."}
{"text":"Great café for a quick lunch close to home... They have great cappuccino and coffee for all of you who can't quite get going in the morning without it..."}
{"text":"The coffee drinks were good and the staff were very friendly (I even got some extra latte in another small cup because the barista accidentally made more than needed). We came here in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday, so I can't speak much to how the space is when it's busy, but the seating is well spaced out and the atmosphere is light and open. I don't think you would feel too cramped if you came here to get some work done. I don't know if I would go so far to say this place is \"serious\" about their coffee but it seems like they do care about good coffee. They also have a small outdoor patio area, which was nice to see."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I go they serve up the most delicious cup of cappuccino I could ask for. On top of that, they give me a little bit of art in the foam. What's not to like about that. They also make a breakfast burrito that is absolutely to die far. Skip the fast food in the morning and go get yourself a great cup of coffee and a burrito. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a quick caffeine fix in the morning or to sit and read or meet with friends."}
{"text":"Just spent the whole day studying here. Great beverages, great service, great food, great Internet, and a great environment. I had the chicken wrap that came with a side salad and the ingredients tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Best locally roasted coffee beans around! We love buying their whole bean coffee and they have a cool program where you buy their refillable tin and use their loyalty card, which actually builds up fast and saves money. They have dozens of varieties of beans too."}
{"text":"Good coffee! Good sandwiches!
Too many WI-FI users, which take up all the tables. Annoying!!"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese I have had in a very long time.  I did not have the coffee (blasphemy, I know) but I am just getting over my morning's coffee jitters.  The food came out fairly fast.  The atmosphere is pretty chill as well.  I enjoyed the window into the roasting room.  Adds a lot of character.

The wifi was sketchy at first but I think I had a magic finger that allowed me to finally connect.  I do think they have issues with the wifi when there are large amounts of people using it but the barista looked into my issue for me.

Large selection in roasts, breakfast foods and treats along with a lunch menu.  Rewards program is pretty nice.  Spend $25 and get $3 free.  Can't go wrong there!  Glad I can support a local establishment!"}
{"text":"Love the busy but quiet atmosphere. Amazing dirty chai (large with 4 shots). Great place to hold a meeting such as a one on one or do some research. I imagine I could write here as well. First time and will definitely come back for more coffee!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times so far, and quite pleased with it!  The coffee is very good, and I had a turkey wrap for lunch.  That was also quite good.  A cute little setting attached to a clinic.  It can be easy to miss as you drive by in Stoughton, if you don't keep your eyes peeled.  Just head into the clinic and park in the clinic lot, the cafe is right there."}
{"text":"When on the west side this is my go to. The space is great. Coffee and tea - great. The oatmeal rounds they make in-house are a total stroke of genius...The perfect little partner in crime for my morning beverage. They seem to have great staff retention. Many of the staff know my order before I even say a thing. Now that's service!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, friendly staff. 

The thing we really like about them is their shakelogy. Healthy shakes made with real ingredients. 

Nice small local coffee house."}
