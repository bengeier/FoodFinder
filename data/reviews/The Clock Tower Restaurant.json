{"text":"I stay at this Renaissance Hotel quite regularly, and the restaurant has gotten a lot better over the years!   The service is outstanding and attentive, and there is a good variety of food on the menu. My favorite thing to get is the house salad with candied pecans and salmon. And if you ask for it, they will bring you warm fresh baked bread.  

Never tried the breakfast buffet because I have access to the club lounge with Marriott gold status.


This restaurant is also good for if you are not staying at the Renaissance but in the neighborhood, especially if you don't want chain or lower end food."}
{"text":"I'm from New England, marooned here due to a blizzard at home.

We have a lot of seafood available but the pan seared scallops may be tied for the best scallops anywhere of any kind. Hands down!

Service was excellent, very attentive at all of the shifts.

Not your typical hotel \"service eatery\".

{"text":"Ordered 7 dishes for a late night dinner due to a delayed flight that would make us miss our connecting flight back home. 

We ordered 2 sandwiches and 5 appetizers. I don't remember which sandwiches we had but one of them was chicken sandwich. There was nothing memorable about the sandwiches. 

However, I do remember the appetizers. The appetizers were a decent size. I thought they were going to be small. 
- Chicken Wings x 3: We got buffalo and sriracha wings. They were okay - kind of dry. 
- Scallops: AHHH, this was horrible. The scallops had a very strong burnt taste to it. The corn and mashed potatoes were good though. 
- Fish tacos: This too, like the scallops, had a strong burnt taste. 

Service was slow but it was also very late and not many people were there. However, our waitress was very nice!"}
{"text":"The Clock Tower Restaurant is located inside the Renaissance Charlotte Suites Hotel. Is it convenient if you're staying at the Renaissance? Yes. Do I recommend dining here? I guess it depends on how patient you are and how much time you have.

By no means is the food below average. The food itself is actually quite good, but nothing spectacular for the price you pay and the amount of time you spend waiting for the food.

I ordered the chicken BLT wrap ($10), and a crème brulee cheesecake ($8). Both were delicious, but by the time the food finally came out, I felt like I had been waiting for hours. In reality, I had *only* waited half an hour before flagging down the waitress. She reassured me it would be at most another 10 minutes.

Well, she was right. My food came out shortly thereafter, but only mine (and the fries were starting to get cold, which means the food had been sitting for awhile). Another 10 minutes and all but one person had received their order. Noticing that his food had not arrived yet, he went out to take a call. Now it's been an hour, he comes back, and the food never came.

The one waitress who looked like the manager came by and apologized sincerely, offering him a free drink or dessert on the house while the chefs cooked his meal ASAP. Neither of which, in my opinion, justifies the fact that his order never got put in (I think his meal should have been comped).

In their defense, the night was lively, and there were but three waitresses, and perhaps not enough chefs. Whatever the reason for the inefficiencies, I hope that the Clock Tower Restaurant can figure it out and improve on them.

The food was great, the waitresses were nice, the ambience was there... But the wait is just way too long. Be it the entrée or a simple dessert, do not expect to see any food in front of you within half an hour (based on 2 dining experiences here)."}
{"text":"Located inside the Renaissance Charlotte Suites Hotel, where I was staying for my Job interview. I woke up to a hearty breakfast buffet, including an omelet bar. I felt kinda Indulging in this decent buffet to fuel a day of my interview.  Decent filler food for $16 bucks!

{"text":"I use them for room service. The service was superfast less than 30 minutes and the food was good. When you order soda they actually give you two. Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"We ate her for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  All the food we had was good, the breakfast buffet was great the kids loved it!  Service at breakfast and dinner were great, dinner was a little off but it was a lot of people for one server!"}
{"text":"Terrible food!!  Just ate here tonight, very quiet and very slow service.  The butternut squash soup was good, but the turkey BLT sandwich was awful, it came with cold fries
The sandwich was supposed to be on sourdough but I asked for it on wheat, it came on rye (I don't like rye), I left it.  Eventually when the waitress came back she asked me how it was and I told her that I did not like the bread, she said \"the kitchen must have been out of wheat\".  $21 for soup and a sandwich!!  Very poor customer service!!!"}
