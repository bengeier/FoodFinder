{"text":"I went to the restaurant on April 27. Next couple of hour my stomach felt bad then going to the washroom around 8 times last night and this morning ( Food Poisoning )"}
{"text":"We went there the first time for lunch when they first opened and find it just okay.  Gave them a second chance and went back a month ago, this time for dinner with family, and it was great!  Salmon sashimi were fresh, cooked items are done well - not too salty or over-sauced, best is that both sushis & handrolls came in great - crispy seaweed wrap is very important and NOT stuffed with rice like most places but a nice balance of everything.  We all enjoyed our dinner and found the servers very nice and courteous too.  Not sure about the other so-so reviews we read but we definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to have AYCE sushi. 

For a $1 more, the dinner special includes your choice of one serving of either raw oyster, Alaskan King crab, or lobster tail.

For lunch special, the offering are also plentiful. We particularly enjoy the different rolls such as Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, and Seafood soup. 

The staff are always very friendly and helpful.

Service is also prompt.

The location in Markham (northwest corner of Woodbine / Steeles ) may be more difficult to find since it is located in an office building, but that does not seem to deter regular customers form coming to the place."}
{"text":"Fast in and out, nice friendly staff, for the price sushi is good. 
Went there at lunch time and enjoyed sushi. 
I will recommend them because it is good food for the price they are offering."}
{"text":"Not coming back. Every customer tonight left unhappy and complaining. Food quality ... 65% .. cooked food was alright but sashimi and sushi was so-so. The reason why people are angry and upset is cause the timing is horrible.  Theyre not ready for buffet style. All the servers are lost when handing out dishes. When taking orders they write the wrong table. We waited 20 mins for a table the 40 mins for the first small dish to come. Then the next one came 15 mins later. Food took so long I didnt leave till 10:45pm when I came at 8:00. No one left happy. Some actually sat dor 40 mins and was only given two dishes so paid and left. There was a lady who sat behind me and kept threatening to leave without paying. Im not saying the service was bad from the servers, they do try their best. Im saying they're not trained to know the floor plan well enough and the management team needs to schedule more servers and sushi chefs on a Thursday night and not have 3 sushi chefs and 4 servers where 2 were newly hired and in training. They had kitchen staff come out to serve and new hires ask othera if OJ was extra and which table is #3 .... I find that they like to switch languages a lot too.. one second the lady spoke to me in English then switched to Mandarin .. when she came back she spoke in Cantonese ... haha? I was upset for the time wasted here but hope they improve because I already see a lot of bad reviews on many sites from dissatisfied customers. Check out my youtube account Bonnie Elena for some older reviews .. haven't uploaded new ones the past year though."}
{"text":"I was driving by last night and saw many people inside, I got in for the all you can eat, something bothered my stomach from the moment that sashimi got in it. sashimi salmon was frozen cold. I barely reached home and ran to the toilet. I threw up once and had diarrhea all night and this morning, it's an apparent food poisoning."}
{"text":"Went on Dec 19, 14 at 7:30pm. Had 9 people at our table with other tables that are full around us. ACYE 23.99+tax+tips = $30.
I cant comment on the reception since someone already got a table before I arrived and we made reservations.
We ordered by writing down the item number with the amount beside it. Drinks arent on the menu so had to get a waiter to order them.

==PROs==
-The washrooms (I heard) are really clean and presentable.
-The place/decor/atmosphere is decent.
-Soft drinks were not watered down! Yay!
-I *THINK* there's a hint of alcohol in the mango rolls.
-Did not charge a \"holiday fee\" from 5days before Christmas.

==MEH==
-It was relative easy to get a waiter unlike other places. Didnt have to keep a constant lookout.
-Waiters werent annoying or rude like the other yelpers experienced. They had a neutral effect overall.
-Sushi rolls and hand rolls werent too slow.
-Everything but the sashimi were acceptable.

==CONs==
-The sashimi is NOT FRESH! *FROZEN BITS OF ICE INSIDE THEM.* We had to defrost them ourselves at our table. WTF!? Same thing for those dishes that are only slightly cooked on the outside, but still raw on the inside. Those were frozen with ice bits inside.
-Our orders are a hit/miss. I dont mean the taste. Half of the items we wrote down did not arrive. I wrote it down a second time and it still didnt come. Got frustrated and told the waiter directly.
-The cooked food (teriyaki) were quite slow. It usually arrives when we're about to place our next order.

==OVERALL==
Not a place I would suggest. I definitely wont be returning for $30. At least defrost the sashimi properly before dinner hours or charge less. Frozen bits and pieces of ice inside sashimi is not acceptable. Just plain laziness.
My issue is mostly the kitchen side of things rather than the service.
Your money could be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friend saw the coupon on the chinese paper therefore we went to give this place a shot.. hmm..

15% coupon and 2 free oysters per person. Only come if this is available. Otherwise you can find much better places with AYCE sushi.. prices r higher and choices r very limited considering the fact its an AYCE.

We arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night and there was a 20 min wait..I was thinking if I had to wait. It better be good...

Sashimi was just ok fresh not exceptional. all those other sushi rolls were just average-below average. The sushi rice was quite big and not cooked to perfection sushi rice...spicy salmon is always my fav. sushi whenever I go to sushi places. 

This one was quite disappointing. spicy salmon only had the visual effect but it was tasteless. I wonder how in the world they can make something tasteless.

Most of the sushi's were below average. The selection menu was missing alot of items.
service was slow and things just randomly came.

There was only 2 tiny sheets of ordering paper on the table making it so difficult if you want to order more when you see your table is running low on food. Had to keep waving my hand just to get more ordering paper.

I've experienced much better AYCE sushi places. 

not worth the try without the 15% discount. Even though after the 15% discount. It came up to $25 per person."}
{"text":"Since it's the nearest restaurant to my workplace, I ate there almost every other day. 
The sushi and sashimi aren't the best compare to other Japanese restaurant like Inada and Tenichi. My coworker prefer Fushimi to Shizen.  The lunch box is about $ 7.99 . You can choose noodles, rice, sushi or sashimi. The service is good and I went there regularly mainly because of the location. 
The AYCE is not bad and they have 10% discount nowadays. I heard that it just opened this April. Hopefully they improve the food later.
$19.99 per person for dinner and around $12.99 for lunch AYCE."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I had the all you can eat Japanese buffet here.  Everything was pretty good.  Not sure if they are good because they just opened and want to impress their customers or what, but I did enjoy my lunch there.  

They don't overstuff the sushi and rolls with rice which is what I like.  Plus they use the red tuna as oppose to the white tuna for the rolls which is a little different from other AYCE.  Some items we ordered never showed up so we had to remind them. My favourite was the eel handroll.  So flavourful!

The staff there was great too .  They were attentive.

Overall I would go back there."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this restaurant was when it first opened during their dinner AYCE. Now I've had a chance to experience their lunch menu. During lunch, a lot of regular business people come in and eat, so the place is really crowded. Parking is really hard to find and once we arrived - there was no one at the front to greet us.

The food was below average, nothing tasted great at all.

Service was really bad, even when customers started going back to work and it died down - servers still needed to be flagged down. I had to ask the chef to find a server for me to get a drink.

This is an update to my previous review but this is definitely not a great place to go during lunch and it's possible when they first opened (when I made my first review) things could've just been \"better\" to jump start their restaurant.

1/5."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet I believe was $23.99 per person.  It had the worst service I've ever experienced, the waiters & waitresses were clearly shit talking us and for what? I honestly don't know what their problem is with teenagers.  We tip better than our asian parent counterparts, but they probably only hated us because we spoke full english WTF honestly.  LOL also, if you're going to shit talk us don't do it within ear shot BECAUSE I DO UNDERSTAND CHINESE smh 

If you want to come here to be judged, go ahead, but I'm never coming back here again. Hands down the worst sushi place I've ever been to.

There was only one friendly waitress, you'll recognize her b/c she's the only one who actually LOOKS happy and uses a genuine smile.  Unlike the rest.  LOL shit talking mean girls style, this isn't a movie guys....

ALSO, it was cash only."}
{"text":"not a bad place to have lunch while you in a rush, food is average, service is average,  price is ok consider is a all you can eat."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is EXTREMELY convenient since I work in the next building and it is less than a 2 min walk door to door. I like to consider myself a Canadian Sushi Eater as I do not eat any of the raw fish options. I usually order take out if it's a nice day and eat outside on the picnic tables. The  fist time I ordered the Maki Combo which is any two rolls from the selected choices for $7.95. I decided on the \"Cowboy\" - BBQ Beef Roll and the \"Avocucumber\" - Avocado & Cucumber. I was amazed at how fresh and refreshing this combination was. The one and only time I had a beef sushi roll was in Alberta at the West Edmonton Mall called the Alberta Roll, this restaurant makes their Cowboy Roll almost identical in flavour.

The second time I ordered take out I decided on the Maki Combo for $10.95 which was any 3 rolls along side an appetizer side of Vegetable Tempura.  The 3 rolls I decided on this time was \"Cowboy\" - My new favourite, the \"Chicken Teriyaki\" - thought it would be similar to the \"Cowboy\" which was shaved beef instead it was cubes/chucks of chicken. The third roll I ordered was the \"Tempura\" - Deep Fried Shrimp. I was blown away at how tasty this sushi roll was, I think this will be a new favourite. 

I am planning to one day try their AYCE bar in the near future. I know many people from the office that have gone and have nothing but great reviews."}
{"text":"Went here on the weekend for dinner.   
I dont see what the hype is about at all.  The decoration is nice, ambiance is not bad, food is so-so but most of all the service was horrible.

The service was very bad.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they are new and are still working out the kinks of how to run a business.   After being seated it took 10 minutes before we were served tea.  They were very understaffed, only 3 servers for the whole restaurant.  After we put in our order, food came out ever so slow.  Our first order took about 15 minutes before the salad arrived then another 15 minutes before the other food started arriving SEPARATELY.  our table of 5 found ourselves picking at a plate till no food was left and waiting 5-10 mins before another plate of food would come out.  

We also heard the table behind us complaining and called the manager over.  The manager apologized that they lost their whole order sheet and they would need to rewrite it, but 5 minutes later came back to say the chef found it.  They then had all their food come out almost instantly... 

In all fairness, the waitress did apologize and acknowledge their terrible service... they apologized about 2 times. *claiming it was super busy (btw the restaurant was less than half full) i dont know how they would operate if it was a packed house.

Galbi was not flavorful and precooked... it came out cold to the touch, and the rest of the food all was exactly what you would expect from all you can eat sushi.   At the end we spent 2 hours in the restaurant which felt like forever! and i probably got full off the pop mainly due to the wait.  

It was my gf's birthday and they told us, \"we can only give you a discount if you have over 10 people\" Another fail for them.

Our last order of about 10 items only about 3 items came out until we were informed the kitchen was closed.

The only saving grace for this place was their Mango Yogurt dessert... exact copy of Matsudas.

With prices so high there are way more better AYCE places uptown."}
{"text":"Not bad... Definitely not great. The rolls were mediocre at best but the sashimi was fresh, beef carpaccio was good too. Sushi pizza which i almost never eat, was better than most other places. Hand rolls were mostly rice but at least the seaweed wasn't soggy. We also had the lobster special, both as sashimi and baked. They were also good but not the freshest. 

Service was odd. The first round came REALLY quickly, but the second took FOREVER. One of the servers was really great but most others just stared at you blankly.

We got a 10% off card for future use but it is only valid if there are no other promos. We may come back to try again in a few months but considering all the great options in the area, maybe not..."}
