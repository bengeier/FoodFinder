{"text":"Bland and boring. Basically all the meals are ground beef + a tortilla. Cactus pear margarita is delicious, though."}
{"text":"New from the Youngstown area and never really had much interest in Mexican food until I was living in Kent. Definitely my favorite of all the restaurants out here. I tend to go by myself because it fits my schedule that way. The remember your face and what you usually order, so unless you want them to get you something else, let them know. All the waiters are very helpful.

The only issue I have is that the steak is sometimes too tough or the overall meal is too greasy. I'm fine with either, but I'm willing to bet that not everybody is. 

Overall a great place to eat if you are craving a decent sized meal for a decent prize. The margarita's are fantastic, so try one out!"}
{"text":"Although I haven't been to Guacamole's in a few months, I have been a semi-regular customer for three or four years.  The food is always fresh, fast, and consistently good.  The restaurant is always clean.  Generally, the waiters and waitresses are friendly (especially Pollo, who might be the manager)."}
{"text":"When I moved to Kent back in 2007, I was hard up for a good Mexican restaurant and found that I lived right across the street from this place.  So I tried it, and as a Texan who has experienced much more Mexican food than your average Ohioan has, I was really disappointed.  Everyone gushed to me about this place, but I told them it tasted like it was made by white people who use too much grease and get their refried beans out of a can.  Not to mention they use that cheap, thin cheese sauce that guarantees a heart attack.  If this is all that's available like it was to me, go for it, otherwise for those with discerning taste should drive to Cleveland for some passable Mexican food."}
{"text":"We waited 10 minutes to get seated when they only had 1 table bathrooms are filthy I will not be returning. Don't waste your time go to el campisino"}
{"text":"I was nervous because of the reviews of it being \"cheap\" quality of ingredients, etc. I had chicken mole poblano. Among casual Mexican restaurants I've been to, I've had better moles, but this was still a very delicious meal. Portion sizes are very large which is nice. The interior design is certainly unique in a fun sort of way. The service was prompt and friendly. There is quite an extensive menu - definitely something for everyone! I did notice on some of the menu items it mentioned it was \"topped\" with \"nacho cheese sauce\" so those reviews mentioning cheap cheese sauce...probably ordered something topped with nacho sauce. Not everything is topped in nacho sauce.  I quite enjoyed my meal and felt satisfied, which I can be quite picky so for me to OK it is saying something ;)"}
{"text":"A great Mexican restaurant with bright ambiance and delicious, fresh food. I tried a frozen margarita (very refreshing) and quesadillas. Great prices for grad student budgets.  Staff was attentive and food was brought out quickly.  Place was full of satisfied customers. My favorite is still Tito's in Fairlaw, OH but this is a great number 2."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here all the time. The chips and salsa are delicious and the food is delicious too...the portions are huge. Inside is bright and colorful just like a Mexican restaurant should be. The margaritas are strong and tasty.... and they have great drink specials."}
{"text":"You really cannot lose with Guaca-Moles. The portions are very generous and the prices are fair. I have had their Margs before and I have to admit that they are very good and in the inside is quite colorful, what I would expect Mexico to be like. I usually get the el mujar which is giant and I love it. I have gotten a side order before of a carnitas burrito and it is just as good since the el mujar is either steak or chicken. They both seem to be grilled strips like steakums but still very good."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in a festive, wonderfully tacky environment. The margaritas are sublime! The prickly pear margarita is my favorite.

Every time I go in I play \"Menu Roulette\", which involves picking a random number off of the menu without looking at what it actually is. I have never been disappointed. Everything is delicious and the portions are generous.

Prices are great, and fit well into my poor college student budget when my friends and I want a nice night out. The only complaint I have is that I wish they were open a little bit longer on week days (they close at 10pm)."}
{"text":"Very colorfully decorated Mexican restaurant with friendly service and a large menu. Paint has been swirled on the walls by hand to give a crazed but fun feeling to the interior. There are several rooms so seating should never be a problem. Margaritas were good but slightly weak. Taco chicken salad was excellent as were all the dishes served at our table. My wife's fish tacos were good. They have a special for each day on a large sign on the wall so it pays to check them out. The feeling here is fun Mexican rather than classy Mexican. Prices are reasonable, margaritas $4.50.

Will come back on our next visit."}
{"text":"I arrived to this restaurant when they were about to close but they still accommodated me and provided fine service. I also appreciate that Guacamole's also offers free WiFi to its patrons. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal and great service. Tried and true. There has been a change in staff and management but hopefully they will be just as delicious and professional as before. We miss the paper mache donkey."}
{"text":"Soooo I've avoided this place because I heard not so great remarks about it when I first set foot on campus.  I don't know who I was talking to, but they were WRONG!

Guacamole's is great!  The restaurant was clean, bright, and spacious.  The food portions were HUGAMONGOUS!!! (While that's not normally a big selling point for me, I totes got 3 meals out of 1! and it tasted good!!!)

They have millions (ok, maybe 10) of flavors for margs for those crazy college kids.  I stuck w/ the el standard one, it was okay, but I quickly moved on to my Negro Modelo.  Negro Modelo, you are so yummy!

The chips were good & crunch, the salsa was salsa...nothing to write home about.  But mixed w/ the spicy salsa, it ain't too shabby.

The service wasn't fabulous, but it wasn't awful.  What do you expect at 9pm w/ a group of college girls though?  Our waiter did manage to keep our water glasses filled though.

Will I go back, heck yeah.  You should too.  Just don't drink all the Negro Modelo before I get there! :)"}
{"text":"Nice selection of veggie dishes.  I really enjoyed the food.  The drinks were reasonable.  Wouldn't make a special trip, but I'll go back if I'm in town and in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"Another great place for margaritas, tex-mex food, and a fun atmosphere. Don't get too excited, this place is certainly nothing special."}
{"text":"My personal favorite for Mexican food in the area. It's always fun in there and the food is always super fast and fantastic. Only downfall is if you go in on a weekend night it is very busy... So busy they forgot to bill us a few times... so I guess it's not such a downfall."}
{"text":"Fast service
Fast food
Great tasting
Vegetarian section :3
FRIED ICE CREAM!!!

Prices are great and atmosphere is authentic. Great spot to go in Kent."}
{"text":"Very decent Mexican restaurant and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Mango margarita was awesome! Taquito lunch was pretty good too, the steak was better than the chicken (dry). Salsa was a bit odd, strange flavor I couldn't put my finger on what it was. I think I will stick with El Campasino in Stow though..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fast service, and i like that they have a specific vegetarian section of the menu. It's always delicious and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Nice place!  Friendly and fast service and good food. Excellent portion sizes and chips and salsa are wonderful. Snappy music and decor make for an authentic experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Contrary to popular belief, this place does delive, and within a timely manner. I ordered from Guac's today for the first time, and I must say that it was pretty good. I ordered the taquitos (all chicken, no beef) and was in amazement at how great and filling one serving is. They are served with sour cream and guacamole and placed atop a bed of shredded lettuce - all of which were incredible and tasted ridiculously authentic (I've had actual authentic taquitos before). I'd totally order that again. In addition to the taquitos, I ordered a Xango (cheesecake filling fried within a tortilla-like shell. It was okay - very oily, and waaaay too rich for one person to enjoy, unless you're really into cheesecake. Otherwise, the food was amazing and I absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican with a great atmosphere, quick service, and great food. We often head to Guacs for lunch because they bring out the food quickly (and it's really good). Tamales here are hand-made and delicious as are the chile rellenos. Portions are huge and cost is low to moderate."}
{"text":"Great service and killer food! I dare you to find better chips around."}
{"text":"Guacomole's was a colorful restaurant and I really appreciate how she seated me when the restaurant was about to close. The good was also lovely and I like how they have free WiFi. However, they were out of bean and rice dishes on the evening that I came to eat there."}
{"text":"3.5

I love Mexican food and I have had my fair share and I really enjoyed this place. I can't say anything on the atmosphere bc my friend actually picked it up and brought it to my house. I got the chile verde and it was something I have never tried before, it was very tasty. The pork was tender, it was just a little dry so I think if there was more of the salsa verde, this could have been a really fantastic dish. The rice and beans were great as well, good flavor. We also tried the chorizo and cheese, which was wonderful. I am a big chorizo fan, so I would have loved more chorizo in it but I would say it was standard to most I have had. 

I really did enjoy the food, and I would absolutely go here again. The problem was that there was no wow factor. It was tasty, but nothing stood out at me so because this place is not really close to me I can not see myself going out of my way to come here. But if you are looking for a solid Mexican place, give it a try and if you get the chile verde, ask for additional salsa verde!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican cantina style food. Always great service and always a great deal. This is a good spot to go with a big group of family or friends."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, let alone fav Mexican food restaurant in the area. The staff have always been friendly to me. The food comes out relatively quickly. I always take dates, friends, and family here. Really good (not too spicy, not too weak) salsa and chips."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, no way does it taste like the food we had in Mexico, however, it is ok for a quick dinner or lunch.  Atmosphere is very nice and absolutely beautiful decor - bright and cheery."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican restaurant - same food as all the others - but Guacamoles is extra bright and festive on the inside, and I think the staff is much more fun!"}
{"text":"Edit!!!

They have gone through a management or ownership shift. They now are worse than El Campesino. In truth, I really didn't think that was possible. But they've somehow done it."}
{"text":"This is the first Mexican restaurant where I ate my entire plate clean. Our waitress was very sweet and adorable, even though it was ceno de mayo the place was clean & the service fast. 
  My margarita  could have been better, it was kind of flavorless and didn't taste like it had any tequila in it but not terrible. It's a cute place for both family and business,etc... will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Some of the worst mexican I've had..ever.  Bland, obviously old food just reheated and put on your plate.  I tried the enchiladas, pretty sure they sat in a pan in the cooler for 4 weeks before making it to my plate, with no semblance of spice or taste.  I would rather eat chipotle, even TACO BELL over this garbage.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant that I've ever been too and I've been to a lot!  Same food as most, but done fresh.  Very tasty and you get your bang for the buck.  I always come home with a box of food!

They have a simple kids menu and high chairs, but don't expect crayons.  TV in the bar and good service.  I've always had good service."}
{"text":"If you like \"junk Mexican\" food THIS is your place!

Ingredients are of the very lowest quality - fatty hamburger, cheap, oily cheese, oily tortilla chips, etc.  Nothing creative or interesting on the menu. 

And, what's with the name?  Why a possessive?  

When others insist on coming here my objective is to eat as little as possible. 

Strong recommendation:  avoid this place and let someone else devour this crap."}
{"text":"Yum!!!  The salsa and chips were great to start   It was mild but had a zip which is perfect for us.  Tons of cilantro!  I ordered the chimichangas and both chicken and steak were great.  I normally do not like the flavor of retried beans but theirs tasted really good.  The waitress was very attentive and we received our meals quick.  I would definitely recommend a visit."}
