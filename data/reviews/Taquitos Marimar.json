{"text":"Wow! Food was great, service was even better. The avocado salsa was life affirming. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"These taquitos are great! Had the meal with beef taco, pork taco, side of rice and beans, and hot sauce - excellent! Truly authentic Mexican taquito flavor."}
{"text":"Mole chicken enchiladas are my favorite. Tacos are also a good bet. Rice and beans that come with the entree aren't worth getting, but I don't even care if I get to enjoy the mole sauce."}
{"text":"So, let me say this first--I am almost 100% positive this is the food cart of Mercado Marimar, the vastly-superior-to-any-other-Mexican-place-on-Park St. tacqueria holed up in the back of a small grocery store.

Anyways, when I saw a food cart serving tacos (FINALLY!) I obviously had to try them out. I got one taco--pastor--and the owner gave me a second for free!

Uh...awesome.

The meat was marinaded beautifully, it was tender, and absolutely delicious. Piled high with cilantro and fresh onions. They have a salsa verde out for customers, but if you ask for something hotter--there's a secret, \"spicy\" salsa behind the counter. I tried both--it was all excellent.

This is easily the best food cart near the library. Yeah, Banzo is good and all, but authentic, delicious tacos from a food cart? I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"The ability to make nachos taste light and fresh is worth five stars in and of itself, but the fact the owner is just the sweetest really puts it over the top. My nachos had crispy chips, fresh pico de gallo, shredded white cheese, shredded lettuce, and a mountain of guacamole. They were perfect on a summery afternoon and I most definitely need to make a visit to their brick and mortar store!"}
{"text":"Their burritos are simply amazing. For $7, you get a made-to-order, well portioned and perfectly seasoned masterpiece that tastes very fresh. One of my pet peeves is also equally distributed contents within a burrito, and they really seem to put some effort into making sure you get a consistent and even spread with each order.

I used to rotate between a couple of the other established taco/burrito carts in the Library Mall area, but I got instantly hooked here after trying their tacos (pastor). I then migrated over to the burrito and never looked back, and in IMHO, this place beats every other competitor hands down (other carts, chains, local favorites, etc.), and I've tried them all. My favorite is their pastor, but the steak is about as good too.

Another bonus is that they can crank out orders pretty fast, so you won't be standing in 15-20+ minute lines here. Pro tip: don't forget the tomatillo and guacamole salsa that are in the sauce bottles on the counter."}
{"text":"Excellent, inexpensive tacos. I love the steak tacos, and the TacoTuesday deal is really great. The folks are friendly and the young woman who takes orders and payments always remembers my name.

$3 for an a la carte taco is great--one of their tacos is enough to fill me up most days."}
