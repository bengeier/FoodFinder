{"text":"Went on a Friday night with one friend. Arrived around 9pm and we were lucky to get a table as the Canadians were playing on the TVs(in New Jersey against the Devils!). The atmosphere was super fun, especially with all of the hockey fans. Our food came super fast (everyone else was just ordering drinks at that time). The fish and chips were amazing, very high quality tasting fish :) 10/10 would come again :) Definitely a pub atmosphere and they had a good selection of draft beers. The place was very loud but that was to be expected with the game on."}
{"text":"Irish pub with Irish beer. Fish and chip and Bison burger are good, onion soup is wonderful but a little bit salty. An excellent  place for watching sports. Next time I'll go there late and see the band."}
{"text":"Located just outside Concordia University, McKibbin's offers a very friendly hangout after a long day. Walking in, you can see all the pub decor, but in the summer, you can sit outside in the back. Service was prompt and friendly and our orders were taken quickly. I ordered the prime rib special. Overall, it was alright for the price paid (which is cheaper than most places that serve prime rib). The prime rib was well seasoned and very tender. I would have liked to see my meat a little pinker, but I understand that they are a pub. The sides were unimpressive (mash potatoes needed a little more salt and steamed vegetables tasted nothing). Beer was okay too. For an irish pub, McKibbin's hits all the right marks (pub food, some irish dishes and pint a beers with friends)."}
{"text":"I was in search of the best wings in town and I found them!
They were big and juicy ! Service was good with happy hr specials! You won't need a meal if you order the wings!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. Started off with their local beer which was actually delicious for 6$ a pint, and had some of the best sweet potato fries I have had. Next came the chicken leek pie, which was to die for! Perfectly crispy on the top and you can tell it is homemade by the flavour and quality of everything. It came with the most buttery mashed potatoes that were incredibly flaky! I cleaned my plate and will for sure be returning. Only thing was my waitress forgot about us and we had to wait 20 minutes to order food, and the place was only half full. 
Food 5/5 very worth it for the price, service 3/5"}
{"text":"I love their pub food. The cheddar sticks with the spicy mayo are great. The celtic rolls has that sweet sauce that mixes really well with the spicy curry. I really like their twist for the poutine with the curry sauce. The prices are good and the drinks are great. It's a fun place to catch up with buddies from class at Concordia."}
{"text":"I found McKibbin's through Yelp when I was searching for good burgers places near me, first two visites were all for a late snack and they weren't serving food, but yet I couldn't leave! I had to have a drink and enjoy the live music! 
I am lil bit biased because I adore rock music and specially live! I have seen couple of bands there and they all rocked \m/ 
Had my first burger yesterday, and yes it was amazing, the home French fries were lil bit oily but yet outstanding. 
The service: my first two experiences weren't that cool, they were not even smiling! (maybe because it was already late and they might be exhausted), last visit the waitress was lovely and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place!! We randomly found this place and the atmosphere is great as well as the drinks and the bartenders are very friendly."}
{"text":"Went to enjoy a beer and some pub food.... great selection in beer but the food was terrible. Had, what I thought, traditional fish and chips. Terrible! Fries were over cooked and cold. Fish cold. Advised the waitress the issue .. she took the plate back and had it reheated. Stuffed the lemon wedge in the coleslaw so the lemon would not get hot!. Really pathetic. Did not replace the fries nor fish. Came back and really overdone now.  Will not go back again."}
{"text":"This is one of those bars that I dread going to when I get a text from my friends that they're drinking there.  

This is exactly the kind of  Irish pubs I hate. They're all over the world and the walls are filled with mail order pub decor and none of the staff are Irish.(I suspect the owners as well)  The place also has no soul and over priced."}
{"text":"Je vais à ce pub assez souvent depuis des années mais ce dimanche midi j'ai mangé le plus horrible Fish and Chip que j'ai mangé dans ma vie. Vraiment mauvais mal cuit, vraiment trop gras ( le gras coulait du morceau de poisson) dommage mais ça va prendre du temps avant que j'y retourne. Ce que j'ai trouvé encore plus dommage, c'est que j'ai signalé au serveur mais il s'en est fiché totalement."}
{"text":"Love this place, my boyfriend and I are frequent visitors. Huge food portions, great service and environment. Trivia night is fun and they always have awesome music!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences at the different McKibbin's around Montreal, so I felt like it might have been a gamble to show up here the other night after having to pass on an overcrowded Ye Olde Orchard. 

Fortunately, we had a great time and largely thanks to the staff.

The place was packed when we got in, but a bus boy managed to wrangle us up a table out of thin air. Our waitress was very prompt and courteous, despite the place being so busy. The food was excellent and the band that night was good and got everybody at the table singing along."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé un samedi soir à partir de 21h. Quelques caractéristiques :
- Typique pub irlandais
- Musique celtique
- Hockey (TV)
- Service en français
- Service sympa
- Bien rempli vers 22h"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know where to start, why not from the very beginning? My friend and I entered Mckibbins it was pretty empty we stood there for awhile waiting for a hostess/waitress and eventually had to seat ourselves until a waitress finally saw us seated and decided she wanted to serve us. After we ordered, we had to flag our waitress down and definitely never saw her again until we flagged her down for our check. Going into the food: we ordered Irish Nachos (which come to a total of about $22-$24 ... for nachos... I mean) price isn't the issue if they were decently good that is. It cost $4 extra dollars for about 7 tiny pieces of what looked like chicken. To add: Irish pride is the greatest I've ever seen NOT here they weren't even showing love to McGregor. Really, really disappointed."}
{"text":"Irish Pub perfection. 

If this place was in Boston, I would be there every night. It has everything for me. 

GREAT Guinness

When you walk in it is dark, but you feel like you are back in Ireland. 

It has coners, nooks, beams, and obstructed views. It is like an Original 6 arena in that it has that little something extra in a world full of bland and boring places. 

They have hockey on all the TV's. I had the pleasure of watching Montreal lose to the Ducks on a snowy night last winter. 

They have some great drunk sing along music. Anytime you combine Irish Folk with 80s music, there is destined to be a lot of singing. 

Funny thing too, when ever I'm in there, I always see a spoaked B or two. I guess Bruins fans think alike.

I'll be back next winter."}
{"text":"Make sure you try amber beer in this irish bar, if you go there. Burger and wings were good too."}
{"text":"I don't drink beer, but I love bar food and sangria. This place is great for both. Portions are quite generous -- You can get a 30oz sangria for $14. Best price in town! Also I'm a big fan of their nachos (get the one with beef and cheese -- it's huge and enough to fill up 3 people) and chicken fingers. Hubby loves their soups too (especially onion soup). 

We've only been here a couple of times, but I've always been pleasantly surprised at how friendly and happy the waitstaff are. 

Plus if you're a concordia student/employee, you can still access the university wifi from here."}
{"text":"Its a very creative place however my experience wasnt the best it could have been. With a family of 8, half of us got burnt food and it wasnt good. The check also took an hour to process which was painful. Id recommend this place only if the place isnt crouded because they probably perform better."}
{"text":"This place perfectly compliments a cold Sunday evening. Great Celtic band, casually performing while I warmed up with a delicious chicken and leek pot pie. Friendly service and an authentic Irish vibe. Great way to end a week. Was enjoying it so much, I stayed longer than I planned so that I could have a bit of scotch while I listened to more music."}
{"text":"Best nachos ive ever had, hands down. The food at mckibbons is incredible. We had the guinness nachos, quesadillas, bangers and mash & sheppards pie. It was all amazing. We went back later and the upstairs was awesome. $25 all you can drink wednesday nights. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We went there, standing at the entrance for about 5 minutes , looking both side for somebody who may lead us a seat. Unfortunately It was nobody who seems to care about new  customers, then we just walked out, that's it."}
{"text":"90$ dinner for two with two pints each and one shared appetizer of hot chicken wings, though delicious, gave us both food poisoning! I had been in Montreal 4 hours and hadn't eaten since breakfast, and now my trip, so far, consists of me retching into a toilet."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star.  Try the Frickles.  Great local pub with some good brews."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs: Local gangs are known to Have pickpocket rings working inside this place. They steal your wallet and immediately start spending at the surrounding Futureshop and Fairview. (WATCH YOUR PURSE AND WALLET, IF YOU GO)


One star for takeout. Avoid at all costs. We were a gang and ordered wings, guiness beef nachos, chowder, and fish/chips to go for the Heat vs Lakers... bad idea. The chowder was put in an foldover, aluminum base with cardboard cover (the type you would use for chicken and rice or pasta) and OF COURSE the liquid went all over the other food. They have to be retarded to use this packaging for soup- my god- not exactly air tight guys! Ok so the soup thing was bad, and it just went downhill from there... the nachos were packaged with no thought either. Four portions worth of nachos were bundled into layers of aluminum foil into the form of a silver canon ball à la Jack Sparrow. So the warm beef softened all the chips into soggy crap. Also, not enough salsa for a to-go order. Anyway, it's clear they have no to-go experience and don't care about investing in real packaging to protect their food integrity. My friends hadn't tried McK before, so I looked like an idiot for actually recommending McK for our gamenight. 

Usually, I would call the manager, but  honestly this takeout experience was so lame and careless- I wasn't in the mood to give helpful feedback. (I was too busy entertaining guests and making excuses for the weak food)

But all was saved, because the game was amazing (as always) and the MTL microbrew we had stocked was perfect enough to wash everything away;-)"}
{"text":"The first \"true\" hot wings I have ever eaten. The Rim Reaper is no joke and there will be consequences in the bathroom the following day!"}
{"text":"Saw the place on Rue Bishop. Had the bison burger & fries on the first visit. Grilled salmon and mashed potatoes the next. All good. Plenty of Irish ale and stout on tap. Staff seemed friendly. The Guinness was expertly drawn. I'd go again. You don't have to speak French to be treated well here!

By the way, it seemed I was able to log on to workable Wi-Fi when I was there last week. Great old house that it's in."}
{"text":"Did not even get a chance to order! Sat down and promptly got kicked out because we had kids! Went over to the la cage with no problems!

Not for kids but unsure why!"}
{"text":"A friendly bar doing last call at 2AM.  'Speakeasy' -like atmosphere feels like you'd get busted by the G Men any minute.  As advertised, dark, dank drinkhole - no college kids around.

Had Murphy's Stout on tap ('Guinness' also).  Feels like you're in Dublin. The taps are clean and you should have a pint if you have the chance. Heavy roasted chocolate flavour so deserve more broad appeal than heavily marketed Guinness."}
{"text":"McKibbins is a great Irish pub out here. As generally stated, live music pretty much every night and great Guinness. Lively friendly group of people in there, and very hot bartenders. Friendly bouncer, thought me and my friends ID's were fake, but i guess he wasn't used to seeing texas IDs in Montreal xD $8 pints, pretty reasonable. We had a great start to our night here!"}
{"text":"Good place, nice band/music...get's full right before club peak time, and quiets down after 1h-2h AM"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. some drinks some awesome food and trivia night. Over all an amazing experience this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with my friends. They cater to all age groups and have amazing food and beer."}
{"text":"This is the what I proper Irish pub should model itself after. It's a very laidback place with a friendly staff and solid Irish pub food.  The picky eater I was with loved her steak sandwich. They menu is well rounded with several hearty choices.

The atmosphere was really chill with everyone seem to be in their own world enjoying themselves. Seating was at a premium since this place seemed to be packed early.  The had a band but the best part was when they brought out the traditional Irish Dancers. I think that's a nice touch that adds to the experience and goes above and beyond your regular day pub down the street. 

This is a good place if you want to chill if you are not into the nightclubs that are all around the area, but still want to have a good time."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm partial to Irish pubs regardless of location, and this place is consistent. Excellent speedy service, the food is tasty, and they actually have a great veggie burger with super tasty fries. The Guinness is poured correctly. Lots of TVs to watch hockey and lots of regulars. I come here every time I come to the west island for work.

I miss the soya veggie burger, the bean version is good, but nowhere near as good as the fake meat version."}
{"text":"Overpriced beer, but lively crowd. One of the few places in the area that often has a live band. The place gets packed so get there early."}
{"text":"Ah ! La bière irlandaise ! Ah ! La bouffe irlandaise ! Le charme de ce pays qui me semble si sympathique et où je me verrais bien faire les 400 coups dans ses mille et un pubs la nuit et admirer ses vertes contrées le jour. Le McKibbin's est un autre de ces nombreux pubs irlandais que nous avons la chance d'avoir à Montréal. Je me sens toujours bien dans un pub irlandais. Celui-ci a une (petite) terrasse à l'arrière et on y est serrés, comme dans tous les pubs irlandais. Il y a un bon choix de bière, mais ma préférence va bien sûr à la Guinness et la Kilkenny, deux classiques pour moi. Les burgers sont excellents et les amateurs de fish & chips (j'en suis) ne seront pas déçus. Le personnel est très sympathique, nous avons bien rigolé avec la serveuse et le service a été rapide et courtois."}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe, bonne bière et bonne compagnie.
Rien à se pitcher sur les murs mais bien sympathique et bien apprécié. J'y retourne souvent avec beaucoup de plaisir."}
{"text":"To this day I have love every single visit. Always fresh great price and spectacular service. Menu is never boring always amazing."}
{"text":"Jamie makes cat masks, and pours a nice pint.  If she isn't there all bets are off.  Caroline was not impressed."}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable! Nachos et ailes étaient super bonnes! Junk food par excellence! Bière et bonne compagnie"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Friday night. A band was rocking the house. Lots of fun. The beer selection is pretty standard. This is your classic Irish pub. The girl to guy ratio was really low. A little crowded as well. Good atmosphere and an older crowd. Had fun here, but probably not a first choice in the area."}
{"text":"The servers and the bartenders are great!

The beers are nice and cold (this is one of my favourite places for beers).
I have tried several main dishes on the menu and most of them are from good to excellent - the appetizers are excellent.  The portion is usually very generous.

The only down side (as the result of their own success), It can be quite crowded and noisy sometimes.  So be prepared to talk LOUD to be heard."}
{"text":"This review is on McKibbin's at Pointe-Claire.
Great place to drink, eat and chat with friends. Been there for lunch, great and efficient service. You will not run out of mayo nor ketchup, I got huge basket just for myself! WIFI available."}
{"text":"J'adore cette endroit! Service courtois, décor réussi, excellente bouffe et un très bon choix de bières. Si vous avez un palais épicé, allez essayer les ailes de poulet Rim Reaper... Vous serez surpris!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food (fish and chips, shepherds pie, burger, kidney pie), great ambiance ... Not-so-good service. Our first and only experience was disappointing: despite the restaurant being EMPTY on this Sunday afternoon, not enough menus were provided despite requesting an extra one, no water glass refills (had to request twice), wrong meal provided to one guest, followed by the waitress debating who made the error, no apology for the error, hair on the waitresses hand while delivering the dishes and hair on one guest's water glass rim. I had requested a medium burger but it was very well done. I emailed the address on the website prior to our visit to point out two flagrant typos on their website (drolling vs drooling and your vs you're) and then after our visit to share our experience and received no response for weeks; apparently I had emailed  the wrong address. I was told that all burgers were well done and should've been advised. I was offered a 25$ gift certificate, barely enough to entice us to return, I replied mentioning this and asking if my second email about the typos was received, I received no reply. 

We won't return."}
{"text":"Chill and amazing spot for beer.
Lots of beer options.
Good food as well.
Their Guinness is so fantastic!

Had a great time here I would never forget."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing in terms of food, drinks and staff. Every time I go, I am never disappointed. I love the fact that they have a live band at night; the atmosphere is positive and everybody I have been with always had fun!"}
{"text":"Super bonne bouffe!! Les serveuses sont très sympathiques et la bière est bonne, j'y retournerai sans hésitation !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great music, great food.  Definitely the place to go when you're in the west island.  Try to lamb stew, and Kilkenny brew ;)"}
{"text":"I was a little shocked when I first saw this location of McKibbins open. As a Concordia alumni, it just didn't seem right to have a location on St Laurent. But I have since warmed up to it, and discovered its actually pretty nice to have an Irish pub to duck into on a weeknight when I want to meet up with some friends for a pint and some grub. As others have mentioned, the staff are great, friendly and relaxed, and best of all helpful! Not sure what you feel like? Ask!"}
{"text":"McKibbins is the kind of place you go to when you want to sit and drink a pint or two and just relax.  The space is dark yet welcoming, with lots of corners.  The list of draft beers is extensive.  The food menu has lots of choices and is consistently good.  While the fish and chips is not the absolute most amazing fish and chips I've ever had, it's still excellent, and a far cry from the so-so fish and chips most places try to pass off.  

McKibbons is my choice when I want comfort food and good beer."}
{"text":"Not very impressive at all. I went there for the famous hot wings challenge and completed it in 20 minutes. They did not out my name on their Wall of Flames for some reason :(

Seriously though, their food is very mediocre and the beer is just OK. The service was alright and there is just nothing that really stands out comparing to other pubs."}
{"text":"Food was great, had the nachos and they were delicious. Food came quick and our first round of drinks came and then nothing. We ate drank our drinks, and our waitress was no where to be found. We wanted to order more drinks but after waiting 15-20 mins with and empty table we finally were able to flag her down and just asked for the bill."}
{"text":"Boom! Finally a place where you can go and order chicken strips and not feel like a 9 year old, because those suckers are actually so beast. Tender, large and crispy cooked to perfection with a hefty serving of delicious french fries. Wings? Time
To roll up those sleeves and take these to pound town... although a little pricey for chicken wings, it's worth a try since there isn't much of a \"chicken wing\" scene in Montreal. A solid wing night with cheap wings would make me give this place a 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"Recently I went to McKibbin's Irish Pub. Truthfully I'm not a picky eater nor someone who often complaints. Yet, our lunch that we had was horrible. May sound harsh, but it was simply horrible.
Yes, the service was good and our waitress was kind and polite.. But not more than that. We went on a Friday, and it was also a clear sign that they were short staffed. An Irish Pub on a Friday short staff.. Not at all a good impression. Keep in mind this location recently had a shooting during a fight on a weekend night.
We had ordered fish and chips(We were told that's their specialty) and a French onion soup.
The French onion soup tasted like salty thick water with colour. The bread which the soup should have, was not toasted, therefore it was a soggy old tasting piece of bread. The onions were not fully cooked, therefore they tasted crunchy. The cheese was a lump, not beautifully melted as it should be.
The Fish and chips, were incredibly greasy. Yes, I know it's fried food. The level of greasiness was simply absurd. It absorbed through the paper and dripped a bit from the one piece of fish. Yes, just one piece. The batter on the fish was slipping off each time it was cut, to only realize how much grease there was in this dish. The fries were Ok, if you like fries that taste as if they were warmed up and ,not freshly made.
Luckily our waitress never asked us how our food was, nor if we needed anything else. Otherwise, I would have shared these exact comments to her. I know it's not her fault. But, if a simple bowl of soup can't be well prepared and your specialty was disappointing as well. I think it gives me a good reason not to return. Again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"For some reason McKibbin's is one of the go-to's of my friends so I gave it a go about a year ago. I understood why very quickly! The atmosphere is nice, surprisingly not noisy even though the bar is big (probably due to the very good placements of heavy duty wooden walls that diminish the sound), good quality furniture and appropriate spacial management for seating, very welcoming bar and a friendly staff.

The food is also decent. It's at McKibbin's where I fell in love with sweet potato fries! There is also a stage for the occasional bands. I've heard two play which were mediocre at best. Surprisingly a lot of security but I understood the need after I've seen a bad drunk threatening to get the Russian mafia to shoot the pub up after getting thrown out of a bar.

I've never tried The Rim Reaper Challenge as I already passed 20 minutes under a sink with tears rolling down my cheeks after trying Cage Aux Sports' 9-1-1 hot wings and didn't wish to permanently damage my taste buds but it seems quite fun if you think you're up to it!

+1 for deep fried pickles! (I liked them and I usually hate pickles 0.o!)

The one thing that killed it for me is the price of the beer. 19.95$ FOR A PITCHER OF MOOSEHEAD?!? WHAT THE F****! McKibbin's has without a doubt the most expensive pitchers of piss-tier beer I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Before my bf and I left for Toronto, we wanted to sit out on a patio, or as they call it here, Le Terrace. Since we did not know the area, we stopped at the first pub we came across. For a hot, sunny, Sunday, this place was very quiet. Where were all the people? (If we had just walked a bit further on the street, and turned left, we would have seen all the people on better and snazzier patios...boo).

Not a problem. The food here was very yummy and good. The menu's are very cute as it's the form of an old newspaper that has cool facts about The Titanic (did you know that the ship was the first ever to have an indoor pool?) 

My bf decided to order their Sheppard's Pie, which is one of the restaurants signature dishes. Very yummy, rich and filling. I decided to order their Main Salad with Chicken, which was also very good. Something light amidst the Beer-drenched wings we ordered for apps. 

Overall, a great place to stop by for a quick drink. Service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"\"Have another little piece of my heart now, baby.\"

Oh sorry, that's been stuck in my head for an entire week.

It's your first visit to Montreal ever and you're excited to party your pants off. In search for some clubbing action, you find yourself amongst hundreds of people crowding St. Laurient. Like a stripper swimming in a tip jar of singles, you can't wait to get your dance.

Naive American: \"Is there a cover?\"
Bouncer: \"No, wait on line.\"
(wait)
Bouncer: \"Your name? You on the guest list?\"
Naive American: \"Umm....\"

This continues to occur for every single club on the St. Laurient strip. Freezing cold and losing your buzz, any glimmer of hope for fun is slowly drifting away. Finally, you give up on the club idea and step into the opposite of what you were looking for, an Irish pub.

However, it turns out all well. No line and the bouncer immediately lets you in. It's crowded and lively inside. There's an amazing live band playing classic rock. You immediately run to the bar. \"BEER AND SHOT!\" Take your shot, run to the front of the crowd with beer in hand, and sing at the top of your lungs some Janis Joplin, \"Have another little piece of my heart now, baby!\"

Let the Guinness and Jameson take care of the rest of the night. Rinse. Repeat."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of extremely loud, trashy, and dirty places, and so this place isn't exactly exciting in my books. Drinks are ok, and food is fine (although a friend of mine just had a bad case of food poisoning from their dish of the day...). Not really my cup of tea, but if you're a fan of Irish pubs, I guess this is one of the more popular ones.."}
{"text":"Ah McKibbin's.. Come for the wood panneling and ironic ye-ole-irish signeage, stay for the gazillion intimate little alcoves, 90s alterna-rock music and decently-priced booze. 

As a vegan, my options are limited. They'd be even more limited if I had the vegan ethics to pass up on the fries or potato-leak soup or vegie burger, all of which probably wouldn't cut vegan standards if I asked about ingredient and cooking specifics. But ya know, it's McKibbin's. And I keep going back. The food isn't terrific by any means, but screw it there's ambiance at McKibbin's.  And that counts for a lot.

Last time I went there was before a Hab's game. I was with my dad and little brother and I ordered a shot and a beer and my little brother did likewise and my dad disapproved and just ordered orange juice or some such. It was awesome. Or the times I've met Jason there after work and it's so close and convenient it takes you five minutes from job to drink. Oh - and pretty much at every point when I've felt depressy, I've gone there to drink booze with a friend in a back booth. And then we order fries. And the the Gin Blossoms come on the stereo system and we're all like \"Hey, Jealousy... hey jealousy..\" And then somehow, it's better. That's why McKibbin's gets 4 stars."}

Bread: burnt (almost)

Going back for sure!
Food truck Tuesday and best fish n chips! Bison burger"}
{"text":"This place is very cool and mellow. The live band was very enjoyable to listen with there different variety of songs. They made it feel comfortable for people to stand and dance and sing along out loud. The bar as a whole is pretty big with 3 different floors. The drinks are reasonable price and the staff are pretty cool. One of the nights I went the place was charging an extreme amount of money for men to enter the 3 floor which was a dance night (wasn't worth it for the price they were charging to enter). But overall the pub was a fun place to hang and let loose."}
{"text":"I consider McKibbin's to be one of my hangouts.
I've only had two mediocre experiences: the curry poutine was way too hot for anybody to eat and the Titanic burger was too expensive for what it's actually worth.
Besides that, everything is delicious, the drinks are great, the staff are really nice. I go as much as possible when i'm out."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! staff was nice and the crowd is pretty cool. Mainly university students.

There are 3 floors; Main floor has live music. Downstairs is pretty small but upstairs is pretty big, there's a dancefloor.

I will definitely be add this place to my \"chill spots\""}

Belle place de party !!"}
{"text":"I took a friend there the night of Jan 2nd and was not happy. The bar was moderately busy for a Monday-great problem to have! Bar didn't have sweet vermouth for my cocktail and no alternative was offer by the bartender or the waitress. Also we didn't get plates or roll-up silverware, or napkins with our food, we also had to beg to find our waitress to check with the table for more drinks every-time, the bartender didn't even know how to make a Margarita on the rocks. Overall unfocused and lack of service. The food could have been hot and mediocre at best. I didn't even know the waitresses name until we left. I blame Mgmt and owners for lack of training and development. I won't go back and probably will tell 10 friends. When I offered sound advice a manager said \"we will instruct the staff to say anything not on any menu is off limits\" LOL even drinks? What a way to stifle revenues. Mediocrity and complacency rule at this establishment."}
{"text":"McKibbins has, in my opinion, the best veggie burgers in the city. The fries used to be pretty fantastic as well, but either a change in the kitchen or a change in the product has left them only about average. Thankfully, they still have malt vinegar.
 
Drinks tends to be a little more expensive than some other places on crescent street. 

Don't ever waste your time with the apple pie, i have had it 3 times and each time it was dry, and luke warm."}
{"text":"I have been at this location twice:
1)st patty's day- which was a lot of fun with live music- and decent Irish buffet.
2) Trivia night on Mondays- this visit- We were a generally a large group of 13- we had made reservations for a group two days in advance. I was disappointed to see the Trivia did not start in time (@8 pm)- more like 20 mins late. There were 3 rounds of questions that were redic hard- a combination of fill in the blanks, multiple choice. The questions were mostly history heavy,  no current events, pop culture, or science. I did enjoy the music round though. One thing-I did not appreciate was that people were cheating using their cell phones- lets be true to  the sport- if you  are here to play trivia- be real about it don't cheat- we are all here to have a good time! The trivia master wasn't strict about it-cant do much about it then. 

 To make matters worse service wasn't that great -our waitress seemed overwhelmed and kept on waiting long enough for a simple drink order. I got a glass of Murphy. I was still waiting around for her to take my food order- which she did once I flagged her down at the cash! I tried the beef flank steak salad (by far not that great- it was slices of medium rare flank that had a weird marinade served on a bed of olive oil and parmesan drenched arugula. I also had the sweet and sour chicken wings that came with carrots, celery,ranch dip and fries- This dish was pretty good except the sauce on the wings were a tad tarte. When it came to paying our tabs- it took long and we had to remind our waitress of our orders several times. 

Overall, I am happy I got to experience Montreal trivia and cross it off my bucket list- definitely does not match Chicago caliber trivia nights- especially McKibbins- other than the 8 pm Monday timing that is a convenience- I won't be coming back here for trivia but will be there for St. Pattys (hence my 3 stars for 2 stars for trivia)!"}
{"text":"Walked in and it seemed kinda crowded but we waited to be seated. Guy walked by and said find a seat wherever you can. 

We looked around and there weren't any. It was raining outside so we couldnt sit. There was one table with an umbrella so we asked a waitress walking by if there were any other available. She rudely dismissed us with \"we have like one other one I think but I have no idea where it is.\" she kept walking right by us. Rude as could be. 

We stood in the middle of the joint for a few minutes to see if anyone was moving. Awkwardly.... And then decided to leave. No one wanted to help or to tell us if there was anything available or how long we'd be waiting so... They don't get our money. Simple."}
{"text":"Le McKibbin's Irish Pub est spécial pour moi. Situé à un coin de rue de mon boulot, il arrive régulièrement que j'y fasse un tour en finissant de travailler.

Parlons tout d'abord du bâtiment. À lui seul, il vaut le détour. À sa vue, nous ne pouvons qu'être charmés. Une magnifique maison traditionnelle que l'on imagine sans peine dans un petit village Irlandais.

Le sous-sol est utilisé en tant que restaurant, qui vaut aussi le détour, particulièrement pour leur fameux Fish & Chips. C'est cependant l'étage principal qui nous intéresse. En passant la première porte un écriteau nous accueille en nous signalant que la bière est tellement plus qu'un déjeuner. On passe une seconde porte et on entre dans le bar.

Quel endroit magnifique. Tout en bois avec des citations et des plaques de l'Irlande, quelques publicités de bières, Irlandaise, il va sans dire, mais surtout la phénoménale quantité d'alcools, pour tous les goûts, derrière le bar. Les serveuses sont sympathiques, les prix plus que raisonnables et l'ambiance magique. Après deux minutes, le sentiment de dépaysement est complet. Ce n'est plus qu'un bar à Montréal, c'est un voyage en Irlande. 

En vérifiant leur site web, vous pouvez choisir vos heures de visites en fonction de la présence de musiciens. Il va sans dire que c'est une excellente idée de planifier ainsi sa visite. Je n'ai jamais écouté de mauvais musicien sur place et ceux-ci nous abreuvent de chansons rock traditionnelles brassées à la sauce Irlandaise. 

Je ne sais que dire de plus. Ce Pub est unique et il vaut la peine d'être visité dans les meilleures conditions possibles au moins une fois."}
{"text":"Located right next door to Concordia, you can expect a lot of university students and people working in the area to be here on break, winding down after a long day, or in celebration of some sort. It easily gets packed over the weekends and since it is a small pub, it will be difficult to find seating. However, during the week, it quiets down and on most nights they have a good band playing. They also have a few TV's situated throughout the pub, so for all the sports-junkies, this is the place to be.

They have a decent food menu which includes hamburgers, wings, poutine, nachos, and various meat pie's, among others. The \"Rim Reaper Wings\" are insane, just keep in mind that the way it comes in, is the way it goes out - BURNING. 

In a nutshell, the atmosphere and service is great, it's chill during the week and rowdier on the weekends. Their beer hits the spot, though I would never think of ordering cocktails here, or at any pub for that matter. And a few items on the menu such as the Guinness or McKibbins burger are worth ordering, I haven't eaten here much."}
{"text":"I remember passing by McKibbin's when wanting a change of pace from Hurley's a block away.

They get a lot right in terms of Irish pubs, the decor, music and feel is spot-on.
The last 2 time I went was for trivia night on a Monday, did not know what to expect but seemed like fun. Our group came in second out of 8 groups, the questions were much harder than I thought, especially the music ones. 

As for the food, I got a plate of Nachos with Chicken on top $18+4, so a bit pricey but it's more than enough for a couple of people. I got to also try the frickles (fried pickles), which is ok but just a novelty food for me.

Seeing as how it was busy, it was actually quite hard to flag the waitress for another beer, had to pay for my first drink upfront (?), and had trouble flagging anyone for a second beer.  So when trivia night ended, people were queuing up to pay.

My last visit was a lot less hectic, just a quiet evening, a co-worker re-commended the shepherd's pie. This is not something I would normally take since i normally fear it's frozen/re-heated but I was pleasantly surprised. It hit the spot on a cold autumn night."}
{"text":"For St. Laurent, this was a breath of fresh air. Plenty of seating, no ridiculous cover and a great live band to top it off.
After escaping the craziness of St. Laurent this traditional Irish Pub was warm and welcoming. The band was really good and kept us entertained the whole night. They have a full bar and plenty of delicious beers on tap which kept me coming back for more. The staff knew what they were doing and the security was friendly and not overly pushy. We stayed to the bitter end and I wouldn't mind coming back for more."}
{"text":"This review is for the all you can drink night.

Went with a group of friends and had a good time. The place was packed full of college aged people (lots of Concordia students). 

The only downside is that the drinks are like sooo watered down that it's pretty much impossible to get a good buzz going from them. Either stick to beer which can't be watered down or drink before you go."}
{"text":"Good pub grub, good comraderie, and lots of overall fun. It's a loud, noisy, hole-in-the-wall with good food and lots of shouting at Habs games."}
{"text":"This is a review of their nightlife - NOT their food.
AH! This place was amazing! I had the best time ever!

((The entire experience reminded me of \"The Irish Pub\" by The High Kings - \"Whever you go around the world, you'll find an Irish Pub!\"))

A group of us were in Montreal roaming the streets trying to find a bar to hang out in and maybe do some dancing later on. It was frigid outside and we literally walked in front of McKibbin's and said \"eff it - lets go in\". We walked downstairs following a big sign that said \"Speakeasy\". Metallica \"Enter Sandman\" was playing so I was pumped. Irish Pub with Metallica - WIN! The bartender was SUPER friendly and gave us information about other local places to visit depending on what we were looking for. Before ending our conversation the bartender said, \"Why don't you guys have a look upstairs - we have two more floors. See if you like it\". 
So we marched our behinds upstairs and saw the crowd, tables, and another bar. It was definitely busier area. We grabbed a table and enjoyed our drinks while conversing. Then, two of our friends came to our table expressing a dire need to go to the 3rd floor. What could it be?

It was a complete dance area! Ah! And the DJ was SO legit! He played a variety of tunes, but there was a definite heavy Latin influence on his selections. Reggaeton and a bunch of pop songs from the States and Europe - so great! I wear a Fitbit and I hit 10k steps from dancing between the hours of 12 am to 2 am. Uh-Maze-Ing!

This place had it all! So happy to have come across this place."}
{"text":"Ambiance de malade mentale...surtout pour la St-Pat...allez-y vous allez vous y amuser. Le band est super"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour écouter une game de hockey, il y a plusieurs écrans qui permettent de bien voir peu importe où on est placé. Les pintes sont 2$ moins chères durant le 5 à 7, il y a un \"concours\" durant lequel on peut gagner des shots gratuits si le joueur sélectionné durant la game score (alcool gratuit = win) et un tirage d'un certificat cadeau après. Gros gros gros bravo pour le burger au bison qui était VRAIMENT bon. On était un pas pire groupe (entre 6 et 10 tout dépendant de l'heure), on a reçu un super service de la première serveuse, un service correct de la part de celle qui est arrivée à 19h (on aurait aimé la voir plus souvent) et un bon service du busboy qui était ben patient avec nos commentaires ridicules de filles soules.

La sélection de bières est impressionnante, la bouffe est bonne et l'ambiance et assez cool, j'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"Il y a des groupes de rock le vendredi soir qui mettent une bonne ambiance relax en finissant le boulot."}
{"text":"I have had the occasion to hit this pub twice this week.  The first time was so good I had to come back to see if it was just a fluke.  It wasn't...

Even though this location is in a strip-mall (you can hit a bookstore, grocery store and toy store when you're there!), when you step inside the door, you are transported into a true irish pub.  Both nights (a Monday and Wednesday) were packed with people - young/old, couples/singles).  

But this is Yelp - which is about food - and this place solidly deserves 4 stars (if not more).  Monday night, I had the special - corned beef sandwich, cole slaw and fries.  REALLY REALLY good. I have yet to figure out the difference between \"Montreal Smoked Meat \"and \"Corned Beef\".  In fact, they call fries \"chips\" and the slaw was \"creamed cabbage\".  Call me an ignornant American, but it was still wonderful.  The second night, I had the Shepards Pie, which was equally as good.  It was odd that it was served with a salad.  The light salad clashed with the heaviness of the SP.  My only critique of the SP was that it did not have more veggies - where are the peas, green beans, etc?  It was ground beef, corn, and mashed potatoes on top.

TVs are a plenty here - perfect for watching a hockey game.  There is also a stage, but there were no musical acts scheduled the nights we were there.  

Service is attentive and the atmosphere is very casual.  This is my new favorite bar in suburban YUL..."}
{"text":"Thirsty Thursdays 

Dirty Shirley's 2 dollars for ladies.

I used to come here back in the day to drink and dance on the speaker which was the cool thing to do believe it or not.

Pretty hard to get drinks as the place is over packed with students but you're sure to bump in to someone you know.

Food wise I haven't eaten there so I can't say much.

Line ups almost wrap around the building so it's best to become chummy with the bouncers so you can skip the line with your friend :)"}
{"text":"This is a place I will definitely return to in the future. I stopped in here to grab a beer and decided I had to try their poutine. Instead of gravy, they use their curry sauce and it is amazing! It's a typical pub setting right down from the Musee des Beaux Arts. It's definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Always a nice atmosphere, often live music. Black Velvet is the best. Good bison burgers too!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend between classes in search of a small bar food-like snack and wasn't disappointed. There is a long list of appetizers available, I chose the Celtic rolls and some cider. I didn't expect the cider to come in a pint glass full to the brim but it was pretty fantastic... Long live the Scottish! The Celtic rolls had some pretty intense curry flavour in them but along with the cider to wash it down it was a good snack. My friend had the onion soup and said it could have used more cheese but all in all it was good. The environment is pretty chill with cute round tables to sit at and plenty things hung on the wall to look at and the staff is really nice, it is for sure more busy in the evening/night but perfect for an afternoon break :)"}
{"text":"We had a few pints here and it was a great choice. Awesome service and good food. 

During the day it was pretty empty which was nice, and we just lingered around trying to figure out our day during lunch."}
{"text":"I just remember I got there from Toronto in a really hungry afternoon,obviously, there are few ppl, and I order many foods. And beer. so satisfied. Nice place."}
{"text":"This is a review of their Monday Trivia Night.
It was my first time going to a trivia night so I wasn't expecting much but I did have some issues with the way it was organized.

-It was loud and the host never circled the room so everyone could hear equally
-They didn't stop cheaters
-They didn't have categories for the subjects of the questions asked 
-They weren't organized so it took longer than it should have to get through all the questions

Issues I had with the service:
-The waitress got mixed up a lot. Didn't know which drinks went to whom and incorrectly billed some of my friends.
-Slow even though the place wasn't that packed when we started ordering.

Food choices were eh and expensive. Their drinks were very standard.

I know this is kind of a staple if you go to Concordia or live in the area, but it's very standard to me. Wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Ah, McKibbin's is alright.  It isn't exceptional by any stretch of the imagination, however."}
{"text":"It is almost an oxymoron as the ambiance was queerly muted. An Irish pub without the usual disonnance is to the analogy of Santa Claus without diabetes. To be fair, It was a lazy sunday aftternoon.

McKibbin's Pickles! Do get them. Ummm, deep fried sourness! We also had a homemade irish stew. It had all the usual suspects; lots of potatoes, braised lambs and of course Guiness. The portion was large enough to feed 2 persons. So we skipped deserts. 

I will be back on St-Patrick's day for the rowdiness... I hope."}
{"text":"A great \"local\" pub with friendly staff.  Most nights have live music.  The food menu isnt bad, but wish they had a few more healthy options."}
{"text":"This a good place to chill and have a beer, very nice ambient specially when the musicians play."}
{"text":"Lovely place, lovely food. We were surprised by the nice live music on a Sunday afternoon. Courteous staff, neighbourly place.

We had the wings, the fish and chips, and the bison burger. All of the food was good, everything hot and fresh. The fries were nice and crispy. It's nothing amazing but it's definitely good and above other pubs! You can definitely go for the food as well as the beer, they seem to take some pride in it :)"}
{"text":"This was without a doubt one of my favorite places until today. My father , sister and myself were here today looking forward to a delicious lunch.

The atmosphere is classic and fun.
The staff has always been friendly.
Until today the food was awesome..
Today I was told that head office had decided to change what had been  a really delicious flank steak salad. 

What had been a delicious blend of mixed greens which was impossible to finish in one sitting is now smaller with less steak..and is now made mainly from cheaper iceberg lettuce..if I wanted iceberg I would buy my salad from IGA.

very disappointed indeed.
Any restaurant can make cheaper food..but cheaper ingredients is not the way to treat regular customers.

Unfortunately no longer one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Pas mal... ambiance typique de pub sportif avec écrans géants. Dimanche soir,ils avaient un \"happy hour\" toute la soirée et j'en ai profité pour boire une pinte de \"stout\" en fût (ils ont trois choix: Guinness, Murphy's et McAuslan) accompagnée d'ailes de poulet piquantes (pas tant que ça). Les ailes sont de format très généreux.

Un musicien jouait de la musique irlandaise dans un coin et la soirée fût agréable. Rien de bien exceptionnel, mais agréable."}
{"text":"Standard irish bar. Nice fries though. Late night menu was needed and best in the area i think.
Home made ginger beer was good but over powered my drink. Good staff."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this one.  I've been coming here since I was  18. Food and drinks have always been great.  Today I went with some coworkers we were about 12.  The food was on point the drinks were fine.  I don't normally leave bad comments but I have to be honest.  First off we got paper plates for our food because they decided to be lazy and cut down on the dishwashing. I told myself it's fine I won't say anything about it, it's one thing. The waitress was perfect but it was so busy she delegated some work to the bus boy.  He had absolutely no idea what he was doing.  He gave away plates to other tables when it was ours and vice versa.  This happened about three times. Again, I said to myself just let it go he's probably new. I then realized our table hadn't been cleared once.  There were dirty paper plates, napkins and cups that should've been cleared.  At one point I couldn't take it anymore.  Everyone had been done eating for a good hour and a half.  I got up and cleared the table myself. However, despite all of this, i have to give props to our waitress Melanie. She knew what she was doing and only because of her I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. All I have to say is please hire more people like her.  If everyone was trained and experienced like here, I wouldn't be leaving this terrible review. Sorry McGibbins, but tonight was very dissapointing."}
{"text":"I've been to this Mckibbins so many times that I've lost count. Whether for a quick drink after uni or to dance on the second floor, i've always had a good time in groups! 

The food is quantity over quality. They only have one type of cider (Mystique) which is the worst one so that sucks - even Reggie's (Concordia's campus bar) has way more variety!

Went back recently for a quiz night last Monday. Was so excited as I'd never been before but I was completely let down and left irritated with a strong headache!! 

It was so noisy that it was hard to hear and understand the questions, and the questions were impossibly hard so it made it boring. The only fun rounds were the picture rounds, the music rounds and multiple choice because we didn't need to strain ourselves trying to hear the guy mumbling out the questions at the front of the bar while we sat at the back. 

Quiz night would be awesome IF AND ONLY IF they posted the questions on the TVs around the bar so that we don't need to strain ourselves trying to hear or they spoke up. Shushing people shouldn't be a thing at a bar. Also, sort the questions into categories and make them more relevant!!! Unless you were over 35, you weren't likely to know the answers! Again, fun in theory but boring in reality."}
{"text":"Ate there last night while here on business. Great service and great food. Mel was behind the bar and offered all her recommendations and some whitty humor. I enjoyed how I was welcomed and treated

Had the fish and chips and they were great. I would return just to have the bangers and mash."}
{"text":"Bon staff, bon service!!  J'ai des allergies alimentaires et ils se sont pliés en quatre pour me servir un bon repas! :)"}
{"text":"Better than previously posted service & food
We split the bison burger w/frites & plate of vegs
Very nice & fresh! Loud but that figures for a pub
I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Just discovered McKibbins with a friend last week, we both had burgers (one was Guiness deluxe, the other was bison regular. We had good service, good food, didnt try the drinks though, perhaps on a night where we don't work the next morning!
I would love to try the ghost pepper wing challenge one day..."}
{"text":"Friendly. Good wings. Its located in a strip mall so it feels a little commercial when you enter. Good for a casual night out with friends."}
{"text":"I've came here twice in the past week and had two complete different experiences. Both times, we were two and sat on the terrasse in the back. The first time around, we had no problem for the service but the second time, it took forever to get the attention of our waitress, forever to get the menu, longer than forever to get our food menu (the waitress came back twice to ask us about our drink order and each time we'd asked her for a food menu but shed forget...). 

Food wise, I've tried the fried pickles, the spicy cheddar sticks, the McKibbins burger and their bangers and mash. The fried pickles were amazing,very crunchy on the outside and warm and juicy on the inside. The sourness of the pickles cut through the fattiness of the fried layer perfectly. The spicy cheddar sticks on the other hand were much more richer, with oozing cheddar cheese inside and a crispy coating. It came with a spicy creamy dipping sauce which I found made the sticks hard to eat due to the amount of creaminess. The sticks were also falling apart from the melted cheese inside. Would have been nice if the fried cheddar was made from fresh squeaky cheddar instead.

The bangers and mash were definitely a hit for me despite the dry sausage (the gravy overcame the case of the dry sausage). The mashed potatoes were buttery, the gravy nice and rich, and the thinly sliced fried onions delicious! The burger on the other hand, was too dry making it almost difficult to eat, the patty was nicely seasoned (i tasted cumin) but it was so dry that it was hard to enjoy). 

Overall, dishes are a hit or miss. Make sure to stay with the classic Irish dishes!"}
{"text":"Good bar in Montreal. Very cool to be in a very Irish pub with French accents all around. 

I agree with the last two posts, the pub grub is indeed delicious, I enjoyed their shepherd's pie, which is ground beef and corn in a braised stock and scented with rosemary topped with homemade mashed potatoes and served with a small green salad.

Wash down all of the goodness with one of their many tap beers.

They have live music pretty much daily and have a quiz night Mondays."}
{"text":"poutine and fried pickles were so good. pleasant atmosphere with a lot of hockey fans. highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My experience was a bit disappointing. I had fish & chips which was just ok. Portion size was generous and flavor was good, but neither fish nor potato was fried well and wound up a bit soggy. Beer was good, but service was very lazy. Napkins were never provided for the table and waters were hard to get refilled."}
{"text":"Situated in downtown Montreal in Bishop street, this is one of the many Irish Pub we have here in Montreal.
I went there on the lunch hour with a friend just to enjoy the nice short summer weather that we have here in Montreal. 
Weekday, lunch hour, there wasn't many people, we took a table at the back in their terrace. It was very relaxing, not much noise, getting your dose of vitamin D.
I ordered a cider and their chicken tikka masala. I know right? Indian food in an Irish pub? What is this madness? But apparently they're famous for their curry, go figure. Anyway, drinks always good, if you're a beer person, they have good tap beer there; as you can see, I'm not a beer person but the cider was decent. Now the main dish; the chicken was very tender. I would've love the curry to be a bit stronger; me personally I found it a bit soft. No complaints on the rice.
Overall it was a very chill lunch break experience.

Fun fact: to try once in a life time: Irish pub + saint-patty's day. Apparently it's nuts. Gotta reserve in advance though."}
{"text":"Top notch folks, top notch. The chicken and leek pie was classic. I also enjoyed a really tasty kronenberg 1664 on tap. The truly fun part was sitting around listening to all the other people cursing at the hockey game en francais. I didn't order it, but I saw they have a Titanic burger which looked epic. The only thing I would suggest is if you're really hungry, you might want to eat a little something before coming in, because the wait for the food was very long. It took more than 60 minutes to get my dinner. I didn't care because I was with some folks and we were busy kicking back and socializing."}
{"text":"The service was slow initially but picked up. The burger that we ordered was not correct, we asked for bacon and cheese only and it came all dressed. Curry poutine was good. Nachos were so-so but more cheese to chip ratio was required. The beer was cheaper than the soft drinks. Overall an ok place to eat"}
{"text":"I always have a great time when I go here. I go with the same group of friends, and we order the same thing. Hamburgers. And they do them well! Do not order the fire wings. Two of my friends did despite repeated warnings by the waitress, and snot started running out of four nostrils at the same time. It was disgusting. Yet quite hysterical. 

I need to find new friends to take here... So they can try the wings;))"}
{"text":"Ce pub irlandais de la rue Bishop est tout simplement irrésistible. D'abord, même si on y est un peu à l'étroit à cause la popularité de l'endroit, l'ambiance a un je-ne-sais-quoi de magique, qui tient peut-être de quelque farfadet irlandais invisible surplombant le pub. Plus sérieusement, outre la promiscuité qui y règne, les murs sont tapissés de décorations rappelant l'Irlande, la lumière y est tamisée et on y mange et y boit très bien. Les principales bières irlandaises présentes sur le marché québécois sont offertes, notamment la traditionnelle Guinness, la Harp et la Kilkenny. Au niveau culinaire, c'est un menu de pub qu'on offre et la nourriture est à la hauteur des attentes. Elle est simple et savoureuse, du moins pour ce qui est des plats de spécialité. Les Celtic Rolls et le Fish and chips irlandais du Pub en valent vraiment la peine. Cependant, j'ai regretté avoir opté pour le hamburger lors de ma dernière visite : non pas qu'il n'était pas bon, mais il n'avait rien de plus que celui qu'on sert dans à peu près n'importe quel fast-food à prix moindre."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT time here with the cute, young bartender, who had an Irish brogue and was from Ireland (so don't believe what you read in all the reviews). He poured wonderfully strong Irish Coffees and we enjoyed gabbing with other travelers on the outside porch.  

By the way, the outside \"porch\" has only three 2-person tables.  There is fun to be had inside however.  Staff is very friendly and knows lots about Montreal. Hubby and his buddy enjoyed some local brews."}
{"text":"I was there to challenge the \"The Rim Reaper\" chicken wings. It is so spicy that if you manage to finish 12 of them, your name is honoured on their wall of fame. 

I am the type of person who eats spicy food for the majority of my meals. And prior to McKibbin, I have eaten chicken wings deep fried by hot pepper oil. Yet I was only able to eat a really tiny bite. (smaller than a Skittle bean) Then I began to tear and drank 2 large glasses of ice water.

It was terrible experience. I strongly advice that people do not attempt it. (and you have to order either 6 or 12, most people cant even finish 1)

Then I had their Bangers and Mash. It is onion rings sit on the top of bacon, 3 sausages and gravied mashed potatoes. It was the best onion rings I have had in my life. It was so crispy and it melts in mouth.

Lastly, I had the Fisherman's Seafood Chowder, mainly because I wanted some soup to neutralize the spicy chicken in my stomach. The chowder was too sour so I only had a few spoons. For that reason I didnt give 5 star. Everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"The waitress was not nice. She forgot the spoon and..she was talking all the time with his colleage and I waited 15 min for some water.the music was terrible.at last she ordered dinner on behalf on me 12 piece of wings chicken instead of 6 peice .and gave me the bill without my request.finnaly she was the worst waitress I saw"}
{"text":"A great Pub with a friendly (attractive) staff.  They have a great selection of beer, even though the waitress didn't know what a Hefeweizen was, but I was happy with their Weissbier (white beer).  They have excellent food.  As appetizers go; their Guinness Nachos are great and I recommend their Frickles (fried pickle spears).  The main dish I recommend to everyone is the Irish Stew, because #1 - baby animals taste the best and #2 - seriously, it's an awesome dish (its large enough to share with someone, though you may regret sharing).   The atmosphere is very lively and fun to hang out and throw back a few."}
{"text":"J'aime les choix de bières et la bouffe, l'ambiance! J'adore les burgers et les plats typiques irish. Quelques soirs y a un band qui joue et les lundis on joue au Trivia! Le decor est rustique, mais les toilettes des femmes sont au 2e etage? Pourquoi?"}
{"text":"Great beers on tap! I ordered the bison burger was amazing, cooked perfectly and their fries melt in your mouth!!!!"}
{"text":"Such friendly service - our service was the nicest lady and she had a GREAT sense of humour.  (I could tell from our very short encounter.)  The food was tasty - although you might find yourself adding a bit of salt to the soup.  Great live music (in the middle of the day!) and great brews!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas vraiment donné une chance à ce pub Irlandais en commandant des nachos et des quesadillas mais c'était quand même très respectable. Bon choix de bières en fut. Service rapide, efficace et amical. Stationnement facile."}
{"text":"Typical pub fare (very generous portions) and a decent selection of beers. It's nothing fancy, but that's what you would go there for: your average Irish bar experience. Not much sunlight, conveniently located in the heart of Concordia, and friendly staff. Nice building setup. If you're in the mood for a good ol' fashioned Irish pub, this is it."}
{"text":"Pub irlandais où on sert de la bière de pub et où on mange des plats de pub.
J'ai pris une soupe à l'oignon et je l'ai trouvé assez bonne, il manquait juste un petit gratiné plus long sur le dessus mais dans l'ensemble du plat j'étais bien satisfait !
On peut y voir des matchs de sport.
Avec l'offre sur St Laurent ca ne sera pas mon choix #1 si je suis dans le coin dans le futur, sans plus pour moi"}
{"text":"Theresa was the greatest bartender of all time. This was the first place we visited when we got to Montreal. She made us feel right at home. She even yelled at me when I didn't finish my meal."}
{"text":"A friendly barkeep recommended this place to us as they were doing last call at 2AM.  We went to the basement 'Speakeasy' portion of this bar.  Exactly as advertised, dark, dank drinkhole - ignore the college kids around here and it's pretty damned good.

I was about half way through my Jameson's when I noticed they had Murphy's Stout on tap (yes, there are more Irish stouts than 'Guinness').  I'm from a two-horse town called Vancouver and I've been to many a Irish bar in my time and this is the first I've seen it on tap.  My mentor once told me that Murphy's on tap is nectar of the gods.  It doesn't sell well and the taps are usually aren't clean - so it's hard to find a good pint.  Anyways - I can attest that taps are clean and you should have a pint if you have the chance.  It has a roasted chocolate flavour so deserve more broad appeal than heavily marketed Guinness.

Anyways - cool bar and an honest bartender.  Tell Jamie your trials and tribulations and he'll tell you he doesn't care.  Nice.  My friend picked up the hiccups and we tried the usual tricks (holding your breath, etc.) - Jamie taught us a near-foolproof way of curing the hiccups.  I'm not going to spoil it - but ask about it and you really have to trust the barkeep.  But seriously - near foolproof way of curing the hiccups!  That's worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"Just came here for a couple beers.  Good atmosphere on a Thursday night.  There was a band playing and hockey on TV so I was entertained."}
{"text":"A cozy Irish pub on Bishop street right next to Concordia University.  McKibbins is a great bar to watch the Canadiens play - or just indulge in some pints and whiskey!

Known for having one of the best hamburgers in town - if you have an appetite just order the Deluxe Burger and be ready for feast.

Another wacky - but great menu item is the curry poutine. Get it with grilled chicken and it's a pseudo-curry chicken, served with fries and cheese curds. You'll love it.

Finally - if you have a stomach of steel, you can join me and many other patrons on the \"Wall of Flame\".  It's a chicken wing challenge where you must eat 12 of the hottest wings in town. Made with ghost peppers - this dirty dozen of wings require you to sign a waiver before you can even start. In return, you'll get your name written on their wall - and a funky t-shirt to show off your win to all.  My tip to you all: Don't drink your beer to dowse the heat - order a glass of milk, and ice-cream off the menu (why do you think it's there!) and take that instead. Expect the pain to continue hours later (thus the name - Rim Reaper...)

During the summer months the back is opened up and you can enjoy your meal on the back patio enjoying the Montreal heat"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. The ambiance is really good, kind of like an old English pub. The beer selection is pretty good, although I wish there were more craft beers. And as far as bars go, the food here is pretty damn good. My favourite thing to order is the bison burger."}
{"text":"This McKibbin's is a relatively new offshoot of the classic joint over near Concordia University where one may or may not have spent some crazy ladies nights and St Patrick's Days and made some fun but questionable decisions back in the day. It's nice to have this option in the area around St Laurent and Prince Arthur. There are big comfy booths, lots of rooms to sit at the bar, not overly bright, very friendly and professional staff and frequent Irish music circles in the back booth. The food is reasonably fine pub fare. This place would no doubt be better if it had sat there aging gracefully for a hundred years, but we're in the new world, someone's gotta open a new pub every once in a while. I'm sure it'll gain it's soul eventually, and probably the hard way like the rest of us."}
{"text":"I agree with Julia D's review so hard. I have 2 decades of great and blurry memories from McKibbins at this point (don't worry about the math, just let it go ;). From relaxing beers with smart peers and profs downstairs, carrying on the inspiring conversations we had started in class with an extra dash of ale, to crazy ladies night dance parties on the top floor where time does not exist. In my experience, this is not a gastropub or a destination bar for beer nerds or food snobs. They serve the classic pub pints and hearty eats, and they serve them well and kindly, and the mixed crowd seem to find each other entertaining. This is just a fun, quality, classic pub in the downtown Concordia area and sometimes that's everything you need."}
{"text":"It's a mid-range priced place to grab a beer. Food is good for the mostpart. Brought a boyfriend here once since I had a 2 for 1 coupon and he wanted to try the RIMREAPER challenge. Long story short, I got dinner and a show. Wiki the wings before you try them, they're brutal.

Food:  8/10 - good but salty
Service:  7/10 - nothing special
Price:  6/10 - I'm cheap...
Atmosphere:  9/10"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the favourites for locals as it was pretty packed the whole night. This is the place where I discovered \"Irish Car Bombs\" and if you don't know what that is, then go google it. It's a pretty interesting and overall good chug. Anyways, the two bartenders that was working the Saturday night definitely made my eyes wide open and they have a live band music to boot which was pretty good. Although that night they had the front doors/sides close which made the air inside unbreathable, it's nothing major to complain about. Great place to come and hang out to enjoy the live music and have a few brews or Irish Car Bombs, whatever fancy your flavours."}
{"text":"This place was my hang out bar during my vacation in Montreal. The waitresses and bar staff are super friendly. The location is awesome too; short walk from the metro/subway. The food is typical pub fare, but it is actually pretty good. And one night, after i had spent a bit, the house bought my table a round of Jameson shots. Pretty cool :) good selection of beers too, ranging from Canadian to French. Live music some nights and they will turn on your fave sporting event if you ask nicely :) cool place!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and wanted some burger. The burger and fries are just like any pub burger and fries. 
We saw the really really spicy chicken wings on the menu and decided to try them. OMFG, they were so spicy, I couldn't even talk after just one bite. Same goes for my friends. It was a unforgettable experience for sure. 
However, I still won't consider going back to there. Food wasn't good, simple as that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pubs in Montreal, close to the centre of downtown and right next to Concordia, there is always a good crowd. If you are looking for a good pint or a decent plate of pub grub this is my first choice. Most nights there is live music on the main floor, and a good cozy atmosphere, although it can get quite loud with a full bar and a band playing. Not my first choice if I need to have serious conversation. 

A nice feature is that there are 3 floors, the main floor being the main pub, upstairs is more of a dance bar, and downstairs a quieter smaller pub.

Definitely check it out, well worth your time."}
{"text":"Came with my sister. We wanted to find a great place for dancing and drinking. This place offered great drinks. Not dancing though."}
{"text":"Absolute shithole.

First point - as an Englishman first, Irishman and Cornishman second this is NOT a pub. A pub is short for 'public house'. Charging at the door negates that term altogether. What this place is what is known colloquially in the UK as a 'dive'.

On approach you are greeted with not one, not two but three bouncers - more evidence of the quality of this place.

Up a dark flight of stairs you are asked to fork over $35 for unlimited beer; watered down I have on good authority. Unprovoked, I was jabbed in the chest by someone yelling at me to pay for the privilege.

There are a plethora of other great bars and actual pubs in the city. Canadians are an incredibly friendly and lovely bunch. It's just a shame a minority ruin it for the rest.

No-one was around on a peak day of the weekend in a student neighborhood. All the signs suggest avoiding this place which I hope you do too."}
{"text":"Awesome Irish pub in Montreal!

We were looking for a change of pace from all the local bars/clubs. The staff was exceptional!  The bouncer, bartenders and servers made us feel right at home.  We even ended up taking shots with them. 

We ordered chicken strips and fries.  They were awesome!  Definitely not your usual frozen chicken.  We could tell it was fresh.

Highly recommended for beers and great bar food!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here on a fine summer evening where we had the chance to sit on the patio.  Interesting that this pub is in a strip mall but nonetheless it's in a nice quieter area with ample parking.  I came with a friend and had my 4 year old daughter  along with me when were at the greeter entrance they mentioned \"law states that after 7 PM kids are not allowed.  It was 6:30 PM and I bluntly asked \"are you going to kick us out at 7 then\"? to which they replied \"no\".  

The menu comes out on a \"newspaper type print\".  My friend mentioned the Shepard's pie was very good there! 

For the meal we ordered the irish spring rolls as an appetizer?  They were okay sort of tasted like bland indian samosas!  For the main meal I ordered the fish and chips and a full order of shepards pie for my daughter.  Fish and chips were great!  Two pieces of crispy light haddock on a bed of chips with coleslaw and tartar on the side.  Washed it down with a pint and all was happy!  

True to their word they didn't kick us out.  We left around 7:20PM.  

Prices were very reasonable and food and beer was good!  

Only complaint is that people were smoking on the patio.  MIP probably deems this as outside but it's really gross to eat while people are smoking in this day and age!!!  I can't imagine how gross restaurants were in the 70's and 80's when people smoked like chimneys!  

Otherwise a nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"Mckibbins Irish Pub is flat out a great establishment.  Every time I am in Montréal I walk a mile down St. Catherines in any weather condition to come here. The food has always been great (the greatest meal on the planet Bangers & Mash, Titanic Burger, Shepherd's Pie, Fish & Chips) and the beer is always flowing right. The ambience itself is wonderfully inviting and true to the Irish. The wait staff is always friendly and on the ball. Not to mention gorgeous!. Some of Montréal's finest work here. Especially Alycia. You will know her when you see her. So sweet too.  (Whatever they are paying them, they should earn more. They deserve it.) The music playing has always been good as well and not too loud. You can hold a conversation without having to scream. I suggest giving the Titanic Burger a try. It really is one of the greatest burgers ever. Just make sure they give you a bun with good coverage or you'll be eating around it to cut it down before diving in. Anyways, I love this joint at it appears the most people who eat here regularly do as well. It's too bad for me that my work here has become seasonal and I don't get to come here more often."}
{"text":"A lot of people everyday though and the staff is very warm  and polite lots of Concordia students there the drinks are good and not expensive at all food is great please come and don't be shy!!"}
{"text":"McKibbin's is one of my favorite bar: simple, good location, good alcohol, live music, and chill. Everything you need. If you also want to go dance, you can, they have an area for it! The music is usually old rock, oldies but goldies which are also my favorite kind. It's nice to go back in time, and listen to music that actually makes sense. Live music is everyday by different bands, or individuals. But I'd suggest you'd go either Thursday, Friday, Saturday as it's more crowded, is way more fun, and the bands are usually better as well. 

It's nice for a group chilling, or even with a friend, just go there enjoy a beer and music! I personally just hope to go there one year in St. Patrick's day! Heared it gets crazy busy but should be so much fun!"}
{"text":"Second update: I have to commend McKibbins as the past two times I have gone since my last update have been enjoyable. They managed our large parties beautifully and we weren't served flat beer this time. Perhaps going on a less busy day, such as a Tuesday (both visits were on a Tuesday), is ideal.

Update: Manager doesn't know how to handle serving flat watered down Guinness.
I had to update my review based on two new experiences, specifically the one on Friday, February 3rd, 2017. We had a wonderful server who handled our large party very well, but the way the manager handled a situation regarding bad beer left us all a little frustrated. So my original four star review has gone down to a three.

Three of my friends ordered Guinness. Two of them got theirs several minutes before the third and there was a clear difference in taste. The third was delicious like a Guinness should be, but the two earlier ones tasted like water had been added to them and there wasn't even a centimetre of foam when they arrived at the table. When we informed the waitress she spoke with the manager who said they didn't change the barrel so my friends were stuck with the terrible pints they received. The waitress tried once more and brought one of my colleague's glasses for the manager to try. This is where things get worse.

She brought back the glass and asked my friend to try it to see if it was better. My friend not wanting to make a scene or to cause a fuss said yes. She said the manager had simply changed the glass. The manager LITERALLY just poured the terrible beer from one glass to another thinking it would make it better. Now if the glass was the issue and it had affected the taste I would give this pub a lower score because that means the sanitation must be terrible. But it wasn't, so I will leave it at 3 stars for now. The manager did the same for the second friend, but upon learning of the disgusting supposed fix they both admitted to her it was still terrible. Everyone was still able to taste the difference between the two bad pints and the good one. The waitress was genuinely apologetic because there was nothing she could do. So dear manager of that day, when your clients tell you that the beer is terrible and there is a visual difference between the beers maybe you should give them two new beers and not simply switch glasses. Also, did I mention my friends had to pay for the undrinkable beer?

Also, do not order the regular nachos. I've tried them on two occasions and it's simply dry nacho chips with barely any toppings. Both times we left the plates half eaten.

Of course, I will continue attending this establishment as it is the closest watering hole to my work. I just hope my future experiences are akin to the first two times I've gone there and unlike the last two times.


Old review
TLDR: Great beer selection, hearty food, and great service.

Great place to go to after work, but it fills up fast with big parties. The servers are sweethearts and will do their best to accommodate you.  They have a lot of brews and ciders to choose from, and they make cocktails if you aren't a fan of beers. The food is also good, but it does take some time which they kindly warn you about on the menu. McKibbins has a warm and friendly atmosphere making it a the pub to go to in the Pointe-Claire area."}
{"text":"McKibbin's is a pretty cool spot. It's comfortable inside, finding a table was easy enough (we had to seat ourselves), and there was a live band with goofy people dancing so it made for great people-watching. The ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from an Irish pub.

The food was not what you would expect, but a friend said \"that's what you get for eating at an Irish pub when you visit Montreal!\" They use the traditional chips you find in poutine in Montreal, which is not what we're used to otherwise, and the fish was just OK. Not bad, but nothing special.

I had an order of the curry poutine that I really enjoyed, but felt it was a bit too heavy on the curry. The service was fast and our servers were all very nice."}
{"text":"Love the bison burger!! And the fries are amazing!! I look forward to going there just for the buger! A definite must try!!"}
{"text":"Solid Irish food, although always served with a perfectly poured Guinness.  Very large selection of beers on tap, may be a little overwhelming for some.

As for the Rim Reaper Wing Challenge, coming from someone who has conquered this challenge and sits on the \"Wall of Flame\", DO NOT TRY THIS!!!!!

These wings are pure pain and will literally burn your skin if you leave it there long enough.  I have seen people sweat, cry, and cringe after a single wing (someone was recently carted away in an ambulance after passing out)! 

So if you REALLY want to do it and join the Wall, be my guest.  Just remember, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a busy Saturday night. First off the service was good the waitress was very nice and always came by to check on us. I ordered the hot which wasn't very spicy but the size of the wings were big and very filling. I got the extreme the next time I came in and they are more on a medium hot and very good. They came with fries and they get them right that are very addicting. My husband ordered the onion soup which was ok for me he loved it. If you like Guinness beer it has that in the soup. The shepards pie was good and the mashed potatoes were very good. I ordered the whiskey chicken and it was topped with onions rings and the whole dish was delicious. The portion size is very big as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers for a sunny evening (pint of Sapporo for me) with plain fare - not really Irish but surprisingly fresh salad, amazing whisky mushroom soup, and chef special shrimp tacos.  Great jumping off point for local music scene."}
{"text":"Went at 8:30 for a few drinks to catch a band. Was advertised to start at 10:00; still hadn't started at 11:05. Two band members were watching hockey game. Ruined evening for us. Any positives outweighed by this."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper last night at McKibbin's Irish Pub . It's a cute spot. 

Gord ordered the Belfast Chicken Wings with no sauce.  The wings were HUGE and they were delicious (I had one). 

I had Creamy Bushmill's Whiskey Chicken and it too was delicious.  I'd get it and the wings again.  

When we were leaving, a singer was just starting. 

The sign on the door could be a bad influence on Gord ... \"Beer:  So much more than just a breakfast drink.\" Allison was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"Great Pub! A little bit crowdy sometimes. I am going there like once per month now because the place is nice and well designed for convenience. I hate bars that go so much with design but you are just not comfortable because you are always stuck somehow. The staff is friendly, nice and good with service."}
{"text":"This is exactly the place I was looking for. In Montreal working for a couple weeks. My hotel is a couple kilometers away in the financial district. I spent close to an hour wandering the streets looking for an unpretentious (but not scary) pub with food where I'd be comfortable on my own. 

I stumbled upon this perfect st. Laurent spot. Lots of quality import and domestic beer on tap. And the pub food is quality. A big step above the average pub. 

Dimly let yet fun with good tunes and soccer on the television. Friendly and attractive staff."}
{"text":"A solid bar, with a good Irish experience.

I must admit I don't care much for most Irish pubs - they're similar to Australian pubs back home, but not quite the same. I do however, appreciate a good pub in North America (they're so much harder to come by here) and this is one of them. From my friends here in Montreal it sounds like McKibbin's is a local institution, with this one being the first (of three throughout the island).

The food isn't amazing, but if you want a feed to go with your drink you'll be very happy. All the dishes I saw go past looked good, and the dish I did try (chicken tenders) were solid, and a generous portion at that. Looking at some of the other reviews, I think I'll definitely go back for food there again to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Ambiance sympa dans ce pub Irlande surtout lorsque les beaux jours arrivent et que les tables sont de sortie sur le trottoir. Les prix sont corrects niveau boissons et nourriture. J'ai testé leur \"Bison Burger\" et c'était plutôt bon accompagné d'une bière, très sympa !"}
{"text":"I love this spot! Went both at McKibbins and at Winnies upstairs. Crowd was a bit older at Winnies but anyway both the floors have terrases outlooking the crescent street and have different themes. I always end up having a good time with friends and family. The bartenders are extremely helpful so kudos!!! This place really is in a good location and out of the many times Ive been here I have yet to have a bad experience. Hopefully not.. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent pub grub, excellent selection of beers (and one cider - McAuslan's) on draft and friendly staff in an appropriately dark and welcoming pub that was once a mansion.
We went in not sure what to expect the night before Thanksgiving (U.S. Columbus Day) and found a few small groups enjoying their drinks and watching the various games on the TVs around the bar and dining area.

Our waitress was friendly and polite, the drinks arrived within seconds of our order and the food within minutes. We both had the fish and chips and were thrilled with what we got - crispy batter over delicious fresh cod, excellent chips, creamy tartar sauce and cole slaw.

One note: the menu says that they have \"apple crisp\" for dessert, but it's actually apple pie. They were out of ice cream, but they gave us a huge portion of whipped cream on top.

We'll definitely return the next time we're in Montréal."}
{"text":"Cool Irish place.

Good Guinness.
Good food.
Good service.

I Recommend: Shepherd's Pie, Fish & Chips, Mckibbon's Poutine"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick drink and can't find anything bad to say about this place. Service was great and the beer was good. We didn't eat but the food looked decent from what we saw and they were very generous portions. Would definitely come back here not just for the service but also the great selection of draft beers. Good happy hour prices too!"}
{"text":"Mckibbins is everything you'd expect out of an Irish pub.  Great beer, pub food, and even has good live music.  All of the servers spoke fluent English which was a plus.  My only complaint would be that the burger selection could be better, but other than that, I'd highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to watch Price shut the Americans out in the Olympics with a friend. Service was great and efficient. I recommend the Prime Rib steam. It was very good. The taters and veggies also hit the spot. 

I like the mild wings as well as the potatoes.

The cheesecake WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD. It was sooooo good."}
{"text":"I've been there last year there's some typical pub food. In General pretty decent food, the portions are gigantic! I'm a big guy and I need to share my Curry Fries plate. The selection of beer is pretty typical, no micro brewery. Okay selection of scotch and beers. Overall the place is fun, familly can bring their kids to eat, it is load, always sport on large screen and Bands on Fridays and Saturdays.  See the one in the West Island, it's a good place for a boring spot with no nightlife. This one downtown is  good looking however don't get drunk there, it's too expensive for that.

They accept Credit cards and Interact /Bank cards"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not good. The customer service sucks and everything you order something on the menu...the waiters/waitresses get it wrong every time. It takes so long to get your food and their Irish stew is way too salty. Yuck!

I ordered a salad with my burger and I didn't get it but I got something else instead and also, on top of that, the staff wanted a tip in spite of their inferior customer service. 

I'm a proud Irishman and I have to say the service and quality of food at this Irish pub is a disgrace to Ireland and Irish people. This farce of a restaurant brings a tear to my eyes and leaves my stomach aching with searing pain and many visits to the toilet!

For shame! I will not return to this restaurant if my life depended on it!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one for pubs, but if I were, it's safe to say that McKibbin's would be my spot. 

Live music, lots of beer and classic pub fare, it's actually a pretty fun time if you're not jammed in there trying to get a table. 

The food is good, the beer is good, the atmosphere is good. Really, it's an all around good vibe, and that's (you guessed it) good."}
{"text":"Oh McKibbins.  I have been coming here since I've been old enough to get into bars.  It is quite popular with the McGill and Concordia crowd but despite that it doesn't have the feel of a student bar.  You'll often find people of different ages enjoying a drink here.  The bar is spread out over three floors.  The first two floors are more of a pub while the third one has a dance floor and is a hybrid of a club and a pub.  There is live music on weekends and in general the vibe here is pretty good.

Being an Irish pub you can expect typical bar food like fish and chips and burgers.  In general the food is pretty good here and consistent.  Last time I came I had a burger which was pretty enjoyable.  If you're feeling brave (or crazy depending on how you look at it) you can take their Reaper Wings challenge which involves consuming 12 super spicy (think thermonuclear level of spice).  If you succeed you get a t-shirt and your name on the Wall of Fame.  Tread lightly though because the spice level is very intense.

If you're looking for a casual and laid back night out then McKibbin's is the place to come for that.  It has good food, reasonable prices and overall the experience here is pretty enjoyable.  I have been here many times and always enjoy myself when I come."}
{"text":"De la bonne bouffe de pub! Savoureux, roboratif, tous les adjectifs évoquant le réconfort siéront à la cuisine \"mckibbinoise\". Au moment d'écrire ces lignes, je fantasme sur ce burger à la au cheddar à la Guinness. Jamais je n'aurais cru qu'autant d'umami à la fois puisse exister. Les frites sont bonnes, les sauces, aaahhh!!! Et la soupe de poireaux? J'adore! Et Dieu sait que je cuisine le meilleur potage à  l'allium porrum du ghetto McGill! Alors... 

Petit bémol (ou méga dièse, il en va de votre \"épiderme linguistique\"): le site n'est pas en français."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Absolutely love the staff. Ended up having the firecracker burger and it was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most decent pubs in the West-Island to grab a beer and some food. The food is surprisingly good and served quick. There are a variety of beers on tap, including ciders.

Service is quick and friendly, but they require you to pay after each order made. I don't know if this is just something I experienced with certain waitresses, but I find it annoying having to pay and tip every 20min for a new beer or plate of fries.

This location does not compare to its downtown counterparts, but it still offers a warm, pubbish environment."}
{"text":"This was one of the first pubs I stopped at during my short jaunt to Montreal. Just came in to have a couple beers with my little sister (who just turned 21 even though it doesn't matter in Canada since the drinking age there is 18, but I digress...).

Very chill place, lots of regulars seemed to be there on a Friday afternoon. I would imagine it gets crowded on the weekends as most pubs do Service was friendly and it was good times!"}
{"text":"La sangria est très bonne, tout comme les autres petits drinks. La poutine était bonne elle aussi. L'ambiance est parfaite pour une soirée entre amis. Pour ce qui est du staff, certains sont super sympathiques et d'autre ordinaire."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Except the Rim Reaper will hunt you down.

Tasty food.  I enjoy it everytime. Nice environment."}
{"text":"After a couple of drinks at a friend's place, enough to slightly slur words coming out of our mouths, we headed to McKibs. I can't say much about the beers as they are what they are but the ambience was nice. The lights were dim and the live music was awesome. Since it was my friend's birthday we asked for the band if they could sing for her and so they did. More than half of our group were dancing in front of the band while they were strumming their guitar. No, there weren't any dance floors. Did we block the way leading to the bathroom? Yes. Did they kick us out? Nope. Were people watching us? Totally. But more importantly, did we have a good time? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Good food, typical pub atmosphere. Nice back deck/ beer garden."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a pub-crawl on my visit to Montreal, haven't  done that in years but somehow that is what naturally occurred on my Memorial weekend excursion to the city. McKibbins is not located in the trendy Crescent St area but on the somewhat quieter Rue Bishop. The warmth of the wood paneled interior is inviting and immediately you feel comfortable in this well appointed, pub decorated space. I noticed 1664 Whit on tap, a French wheat beer seldom seen in many pubs. I ordered it post haste and thoroughly enjoyed my rare find, you certainly don't see it in the States that often for sure. My beer was followed by a Bison burger, Pub \"Chip Fries\" and salad, I was more than satisfied with the over all quality and flavor, it arrived quickly even though it was busy due to a soccer match that evening. The food, service and overall experience was above average, translation, I will no doubt revisit McKibbin's on future Montreal pup-crawls!"}
{"text":"With our infernal winters, if you are ever in the mood for the best Shepherd's Pie and the best-poured Guinness in Montreal, then this is the spot for you!

Prices are very reasonable and the food, while limited in variety and completely centered on pub grub, is excellent. I've never had a bad burger, sandwich, steak or aforementioned Shepherd's Pie here, ever. 

It's exactly the sort of place you either come with a friend and hang out and have these great conversations long into the evening or you come here alone for a late lunch if you have an hour to yourself and you're in the neighborhood, while studying or reading a book.
Service is friendly and quick, the staff here are pretty young and most of them are students at Concordia University, next door.

Hockey nights here are crazy and the Thursday and Friday 5 a 7 crowd can be quite loud. Friday and Saturday nights are ALWAYS busy, you'd be lucky to find a table or booth.

They now have franchises and there is a McKibbons out in the West Island as well as St. Laurent Street (taking over the old Shed Cafe). I still think the Bishop Street location is the best. In general, a great place to grab a bite and a drink with a friend."}
{"text":"Potato Famine

  McKibbins, one of the 'big three' as Irish pubs goes but the one on 'The Main' is kinda different. My favourite spot in the place is the corner booth in the back. It is just tucked away enough to be a a great spot for eight people to get loud and sloppy drunk...which is what I do.

  So as far as McKibbins goes, i'll take the one on the main. The food is decent though I've never tried the 'remove your colon' wings but they have a respectable curry poutine and are the best place to get a black velvet for a few blocks...until Else's

{"text":"Le service a été long et nous avons eu l'impression d'embêter la serveuse quand on voulait commander à boire ou à manger. Aucun conseil relatif au bière que ce pub propose. Par contre, la nourriture et les bières étaient de très bons gout."}
{"text":"J'ai rarement été dans un pub irlandais que je n'ai pas aimé, et celui du McKibbin's n'est pas une exception à la règle. Tous les éléments nécessaires pour une bonne soirée sont réunis: les pichets de bières sont partagés entre amis (chacun paie sa ronde, non?), la nourriture typiquement anglaise nous réchauffe jusqu'aux orteils même lors des journées les plus froides de l'hiver et l'ambiance est chaleureuse avec un éclairage tamisé qui rend tout le monde beau. C'est très serré par moment, donc si vous n'aimez pas vous coller les épaules avec votre voisin, ça n'est probablement pas le meilleur endroit pour vous. Autrement, c'est l'excuse parfaite pour une bonne jasette et qui sait, rencontrer quelqu'un d'adorable?"}
{"text":"McKibbin's is a classic meet-up, hangout and good place for live music.

It is an Irish pub, so I guess I need say no more about the beer. The food is hearty pub fare.

 In my opinion the live music and atmosphere is what sets this place apart. Great bands rock out on the tiny stage, and a lack of space between the tables does not keep folks from dancing!

It gets quite busy here on weekends - you might not be able to snatch a seat if you come in late."}
{"text":"I just simply love this place. 
I love their ciders and sweet potatoes.
Best burger is the Bison!!! You should try it!
If you like Irish pubs it's your place."}
{"text":"I am not one to just go to a bar or pub to have a drink but I stop by this spot often with my co-workers for lunch on Fridays because it's a great place to have a beer over lunch. 

They have some very tasty choices. Here are some of my favs:
-Titanic Burger with flavours and size just as gigantic as the ship.
-Guinness Burger.... just try it :)
-Bison Burger"}
{"text":"This was your typical Irish pub with typical food and drink.  What was nice was the 1 man band playing his guitar and filling the bar with tunes.  
Friendly bartenders and good service."}
{"text":"I have been to McKibbon's several times in the past; it's a great Irish pub. A disappointing sidenote I must mention is that they don't offer pitchers of beer, only pints/bottles. 

We had reserved the 2nd floor for a surprise double-60th birthday celebration for my aunt & uncle. The staff was very nice and attentive, save for one girl who made it obvious she would rather have been elsewhere, BUT I digress... I opted for the fish'n'chips with sweet potato fries. I'm a big fan of fish'n'chips, and an even bigger fan of sweet potato fries, so the bar was already set pretty high. The fish was well breaded and seasoned, and not overly oily as can happen, so they earn points for that. On the other hand, although the sweet potato fries were pretty good, I think they were a little over cooked, and could've been cut a little thicker. All in all though, a good meal. 

The only disappointment was that they had no cherries for my Shirley Temple! But thank you Gino for not charging me for it!"}

{"text":"With limited choices in the west island, adding a mckibbons is great. The ambience of this particular location has much to be desired, however. Lacking the cozy atmosphere of other Irish pubs, this one feels cavernous and the sound carries making it difficult to talk. 
Still, like the other (better) mckibbons locations, the food is good and there are some good beers on tap."}
{"text":"So stopped into this pub on a really rainy sunday in montreal.  Being from new york city and loving a good irish bar i figured this was a safe spot. Sure enough i was correct.  Upon stopping in i was immediately greeted by a wonderful bar tender named Jaimee. She was amazing!  The environment was filled with wonderful music and great conversation. Jaimee made one of the best mixed drinks ive had in a long time and will try to take it back with me to nyc. Thank you McKibben.  Give jaimee a raise!"}
{"text":"Bar tender Tim was a sage amongst bar tenders. Being new to the city. He set us on a course of fun an success. Even drawing a map of where to go and have a great time. Lots of beers we don't have in the states in a comfy Irish bar. Will be back for Montreal metal fest"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

I came here to meet some friends for a drink, sports, and the live band. 

It seems to me Montreal could be called Little Boston, or vice versa. Irish pubs are all over the place! 

This one was laid out like a real pub in Ireland, with nooks and separated area, and bench seats at long tables... but they did have TVs. Hockey was on and they had a great promo going for if certain player scores, a table would get a round of free shots. Our table didn't win, had it... maybe I'd give 4 stars. 

Choice of beers on tap was good and the waitress had okay timing for refills. 

The local band was good, although started out high and slowly made it's way down, but that's not the bars fault. 

I'd come back here if I were in Montreal again. I heard the food is good so next time I'll give it a try."}
