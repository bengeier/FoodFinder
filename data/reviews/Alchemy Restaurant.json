{"text":"The food will speak for itself and the view is something you don't get around the Phoenix area. Read it has the top ten views in Arizona. Just go and you won't be disappointed. Hidden gem in the fountain hills area!"}
{"text":"Fabulous experience from the view,  to the food preparation and presentation and the attentive service.  The brussel sprouts were amazing, enjoyed by all including those who don't like brussel sprouts at all.   Cheese plate and crab cakes were wonderful appetizers.  Delicious and tender rib eye steak, osso buco fell off the bone , and the salmon was the best we have tasted since leaving Seattle four years ago. We had a lovely evening enjoying a beautiful sunset and the open atmosphere to the night sky.  What a lovely gem of a restaurant.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing views, this restaurant is a hidden gem, the staff is second to none as well as the food.  Make sure you get Jean as your server....he's knowledgable and a warm sense of humor."}
{"text":"Went to lunch yesterday with  important VIP client.  Bread came out without plates(had to ask for them).  Soup was wrong. Waiter came took order. Then waitress came to take order...it was a total disaster.  This is my second experience here where no one seems to be on same page. My curry salad sandwich was terrible. The bottles of wine are extremely over priced. Why can this place not get it together?"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with outstanding views.  The food is good but $$$$.  My friend from North Carolina came for her first visit to Fountain Hills and we had a great experience.  However, upon returning to NC, she contacted the manager in an attempt to purchase a gift certificate for me.  She called.  I called.  Numerous times.  Left messages.  To the point where I won't be going back there simply for the fact that the manager is so flakey to DELIBERATELY ignore numerous inquiries AND WE WERE TRYING TO GIVE HIM MONEY!  LOL"}
{"text":"Has been one of our favorites.  Unfortunately, we went there the other night with another couple and had a reservation, but waited forty minutes to be seated.  Rather than leave, we decided to eat in the bar.  Three of us ordered steaks prepared to a medium temperature.  When served, one very rare, one medium and one over cooked.  After the meal, we all said the meals were extremely salty, including our calamari appetizer.  Before leaving, i mentioned this to a long time server at the restaurant and the reply was: I have heard that before.  We hesitate to return and spend our money on another bad experience."}
{"text":"This is my second time there. Both times were great. Last time, we showed up at sunset and had an awesome view of the Fountain Hills Vallley and the mountains. The four of use ordered different plates. All we great and the presentation was outstanding. I had the duck breast and really enjoyed it. Our sever was excellent. Love this place."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow the staff here is pretty phenomenal! Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We met the chef. He was wonderful. We asked if they had the scallops tonight. Unfortunately they didn't but we decided to stay. They treated us like royalty. They Set up the a table on the patio for us. Our server was John and he was truly amazing. So kind and helpful with evrything. Even when The steak came over cooked he didn't make it uncomfortable at all to ask for replacement. The new steak that came was one of the best I've ever had. And the presentation was stunning. Loved every minute."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic - gets at least 4 stars.
The setting was great.  Wonderful views of the surrounding area and dinning room open to outside with hidden away window - gets at least 4 stars.
BUT service was indifferent at best - only gets 2 stars.  The manager stopped by and we told him our concerns.  He thanked us and said appreciated feedback - instead of comping a desert he just said that the next time we returned he oped service would be better.  This told us he really didn't care about our feedback.  He feels most customers were visitors to area - but we live here yearround.
Not sure we will return because of the service."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. Happy hour tough to get served on a fri. Nite at bar. Bartender busy with service."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast while staying at the resort for a friends wedding. We are traveling with a young baby, and the staff was extremely accommodating and welcoming to make sure not only my husband and I, but our baby had everything we needed. The food was great, the view spectacular, and the service was exceptional. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went for our friends anniversary,  I was not impressed with the menu.  There is only one beef option and it was no good!!  How can a \"nice\" restaurant not offer a Filet,  or even just more than one steak option??  Service was fair.  Price was a bit high for the overall lack of experience."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but they kept messing up orders: drinks, bread and entree. From the beginning they were made aware of an allergy, yet they brought two courses containing said allergy. They comped part of the meal, which made up for it. But at that price, I would expect better."}
{"text":"Beautiful views, elegant restaurant.  Delicious free bread as a starter with butter.  I had the blackened salmon, partner had the duck confit.  Both were perfectly cooked and the accompaniments (vegetables and sauces) were excellent.  Portions were medium in size - if you like giant portions served on platters this place is not for you.  Most of the entrees had a French flair, although I wouldn't call it an entirely French restaurant (no frog legs, for example).  Great service.  On the pricey side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were told we would have a 15 minute wait even though we had a reservation.  The excuse was that they \"ran out of menus.\"

Really?  Who says that?  No menus?  The hostess was kind and tried her best, but deferred to her doe-eyed manager who was of no help and was actually a bit rude.  So, we waited for almost 20 minutes.  Not a great start.  There were open tables, but I think they had several large parties going at once, esssentially overbooking themselves.  They should consider the compentency of their managers.

When we finally sat down, the service was great and so was our food.  The food totally changed the course of the evening.

There were a few other grievances, some of which I know was out of their control, but I'll list them anyway:
1.  The bar was way too loud.  I understand Arizona was playing Wisconsin in the NCAA tourney, but this is a fine dining restaurant, not a sports bar.  
2.  There was a wedding and the reception wasn't too far from the restaurant.  So all we heard was thumping bass from the PA the whole night.  Not to mention the drunk, stumbling 20 somethings roaming around the property.

There was another bar in the lobby, and given the volume of people interested in watching the game I'm not sure why they didn't open that one up to bring the crowd out and lower the noise level for diners.  I also don't suppose there isn't another area to hold a wedding reception except right outside the balcony of the restaurant, where most diners sit to enjoy the view of Fountain Hills?

We may go back to try it on a quieter night, but I'm not dashing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Alchemy is a great place to take people you want to impress. Great views, great food and lots of good service. It is especally lovely when there is a full moon rising over the mountains.  Its a little expensive but you can catch happy hour wine and hordourves in the bar and balcony area. I like that they are so happy to see you, very gracious appreciative of their customers."}
{"text":"I found this place on OpenTable.com and went there for Valentine's Day.  Gorgeous views overlooking Fountain Hills and the fountain.  Food is very decently priced (less than $30/plate), and the menu is simple; but don't let that fool you.  The food is wonderfully prepared, and the special(s) are wonderful! They have a wonderful wine area just inside the resort area as well.  Highly recommend it for a romantic setting! Great patio area as well!  Not recommended for kids tho"}
{"text":"As first time diner's at The Alchemy at Copperwynd, we were exposed to a very upscale meal! And even tho we didn't understand a lot about the menu, our sever, JR, was patient and informative which made ordering so much easier! For the price we were extremely pleased to find well portioned meals with rich flavors that you just aren't normally accustomed to. The view was beautiful, the food was excellent and it was definitely a memorable dinner!"}
{"text":"A few days before learning about Alchemy, I called to make a reservation at Elements. I wanted an outside table with a view of the sunset, as we were celebrating a birthday. Keep that in mind, as the celebration comes back later in this review. I called Elements and they said their outside seating was under construction... Skip that. I found Alchemy when looking for a location with a good view. Plus, it gave us an excuse to walk around Fountain Hills and see the fountain. I called and made the reservation on Monday morning for that Saturday night. I also called and left the restaurant manager a voicemail to make sure we had the best experience possible. He did call back... On Friday around 4 o'clock. 

The manager assured me we would have a great experience and I informed him that, regardless of the experience, I would be reviewing them on Yelp, TripAdvisor and on my blog. He wasn't worried and said I would have a great experience. He was wrong. I called him the next Monday to discuss and have still not heard back from him. 

On Friday, after speaking with the manager, I get another call from Alchemy. They wanted to confirm the time of the reservation. They were trying to confirm 6:00 PM, but the reservation was at 5:00 PM. They also wanted to confirm that we were celebrating an anniversary... Nope. It is a birthday. They knew that when I made the reservation and when I spoke with the restaurant manager. We clear things up, and I assume that Saturday will be perfect. 

Alchemy has a happy hour before they start dinner service, so we went a little early. When we got there, the hostess was standing behind the front desk. I asked her about happy hour, and she seemed confused and asked a gentleman dressed in jeans and tennis shoes if they had happy hour. How does the hostess not know they have a happy hour? The manager also seemed confused and pointed us to the bar. When we got to the bar, the bartender said they didn't have a happy hour, that was at the pool bar. 

We walk outside trying to find the pool bar, and a server grabs us. He seats us and takes our drink order. After we get our drinks, and are watching the view (which is amazing, by the way) we notice a server cleaning the chairs outside. Not cleaning them in a professional manner, but smacking the chairs with a napkin... This goes on for, oh, 10 minutes. It was so much to the point I asked her if she could stop. We asked for our bill so we could make our reservation. Surprisingly, the bill was comped and the server apologized for the happy hour confusion. Awesome. Then we are sat for dinner. 

The views here are amazing. Hands down the best view in Fountain Hills, and past the views at Different Pointe of View, maybe the best in the Valley. We started looking at the menu and ordered a cheese plate for an appetizer. For $14 I expected a nice presentation and a wide range of cheeses... Nope. I was very disappointed in the presentation and felt the cheese was store bought. Nothing fancy at all. Sheryl ordered the scallops and I ordered the duck confit. 

Sheryl loved the scallops, and was happy with her decision. For $30 she better be! I took one bite of the duck and couldn't finish it. It was crusty, hard and quite frankly, not very good. I gave Sheryl a bite, and she agreed. I informed the server and she took it away. I was still hungry, since the cheese plate and complimentary bread didn't fill me up. I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer. For $12, I expected a decent piece of fish... Not the slivers of fish I was served. I was so hungry, and the fish was good, I ate it and decided to stop and grab something to eat on the way home. 

During our meal, the manager came over and apologized for the mishap earlier regarding happy hour. I heard him say, to another table, that was also having issues, \"I'm sorry, but this is my first night. I am still trying to figure it all out.\" Um... You are a manager of a fine dining establishment. Shouldn't you have already had this figured out before your first shift? Also, why are you wearing jeans? I expected him to be in a suite and tie, quite frankly. At first, I didn't believe he was the actual restaurant manager. 

Our server was awesome, but everything else just added up to a negative experience. That and the fact that our bill was close to $80. We did not eat $80 worth of food, and the view, while it is breathtaking, is not worth $80. The whole experience feels like a restaurant that takes advantage of the good view and serves mediocre food without a care to the small stuff... Oh, look. A gorgeous sunset. Don't worry that your food sucks. Look a t the pretty mountains! 

After dinner we went to Amy's Baking Company for dessert and Fate Brewing Company for drinks. Both offered a better experience than we had at Alchemy. It's too bad, too... Because I really wanted something special for Sheryl's birthday celebration. If you are planning to dine at Alchemy, I hope you reconsider. That's too bad, too..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place !!  The wine list the food and service (be sure to ask for Jean) - FANTASTIC !!!"}
{"text":"The seating was cramped..could not sit facing each other. Menu Entrée was limited.
Food was poor in taste ( osco bucco  & beef stroke). The service and waitress was good except wrong wine was delivered & we accepted...not that good. Manhattan was good....for this price, will never return"}
{"text":"With the background of beautiful mountains, the drinks and dinner was perfect.  We had the Brussel Sprouts, which were crispy and flavorful.  The Osso Buco was so tender it fell off the bone.  We will be back to enjoy the view and food."}
{"text":"Not that it matters, but this is only the 2nd review I have every made on anything. However, I felt compelled to review this after our recent experience. We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and I wanted to take her somewhere romantic w/ a great view. My previous experiences have always been that romantic places w/ the best view more often than not - Don't equate to great food. This is most definitely one of the exceptions to the rule. 

The hostess greeted us, and led us to an amazing outdoor table w/ a million dollar view. Unfortunately, our flight was late, so we missed the sunset (Next time) At any rate - It was perfect!

For a starter, we ordered the prawns that was a special that night - We both commented on how amazing they were - Combination of ingredients were spot on. We also had the Eagle Ridge Chop salad, that was fresh, and crisp, with loads of flavor. For mains, she had the Pan Seared Sea Scallops - In a word - Amazing! Cous Cous w/ a cilantro pesto w/ a soy caramel drizzled over the scallops - And not shy on the portions either - 4 very large scallops! I had the Osso Bucco - As good as it gets! We capped it off w/ a slice of cheesecake, and called it an amazing night. 

If you are looking for an amazing view, and amazing food - I don't think you will be disappointed. We live in the Napa Valley, so we know how high the bar is, and I would rank this one right up there w/ the best from here.

At least that was our experience -

{"text":"Dinner and drinks at Alchemy.  Drinks and appetizers were fine.  Special blackened Mahi Mahi arrived . . Cold.  Sent it back, and  it reappeared,  slightly less cold.  Chef missed the mark, through lack of skill or inattention.   A real disappointment.  Beautiful setting spoiled by failure in the kitchen. Too bad."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 BUT this region is starved of decent restaurants and this the only decent one I have eaten at in two trips (2 x 3 days)  to the area. I will go again if / when I am forced to stay out that way again."}
{"text":"In one word our evening at this restaurant was : dissapointing

Mind you, the food was not bad.  However, we looked at the menu online and there were many things we wanted to try.  However, when we got there, they said their menu is cut in about half during the summer (wish they would have said this on their website).  the two appetizers we wanted to try - yellowfin tuna lettuce wraps and smoked salmon - were unavailable.  In addtion, the pistachio encrusted salmon was unavailable durign the summer.

We ordered some salads...i had iceberg wedge which was fine, but honestly, better (any way bigger) at any steakhouse.  For entree I had a fish called barramundi.  It tasted fine (but nothong special), and it cost 27$ and came with nothing of subtstance except for some avodacdo on top.  Even worse, there is not even an option to order any sides! 

Another person in my reservation had the filet mignon (36$).  It looked pathetic.  He ordered it med rare and it came med well.  I woulda sent it back but he is too nice.  Also so small, maybe 6 oz at best.  He said it was dry and lacked flavor as well (what do you expect when you serve a super thin filet mignon med well).

Lastly, we ordered 2 entrees to share, and they brought it out on seperate plates which is nice.  But, without mentioning anything when we told the waiter that we wanted to share the entrees, they added $5 to each entree we split!  Our bill for 5 people was over 200$ (4 of us and 1 child) and we ordered a bottle of wine, and they are nickel and diming us for 5 freakin dollars?  What a joke.  We complained, and they took the 10$ off the bill for the 2 shared entrees, and decided to add gratuity onto the bill instead, which was fine since the service was pretty good (except for failing to tell us taht it cost money to share a meal, when we would have been perfectly fine just asking for an extra plate).

Also had 2 desserts, 10$ each, which were OK but nothing special. 


All in all, its a romantic place with good service.  However, food is ridicuously overpriced.  They act like its some super tasty/fancy gourmet food, but in reaiity, the fish is only slightly above average, the steak was terrible, and the portions were ridiculously small."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Took my boyfriend there for his birthday. Great view, great food and our server was awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here. We asked to sit on the patio to check out the beautiful view. At first the dinner started out a little bit shocking when I sat on one of the cushions that was soaking wet. It rained a few days before and somehow they hadn't dried out. Unfortunately my whole backside was wet during our meal but the food definitely compensated for that. I had the scallops on mash potatoes (requested the change) And the sauce served with it was amazing and so were the scallops. My husband had the filet mignon And was one of the best he's ever tasted. We also started with the wedge salad but I wouldn't say it was one of the best. I definitely have had some better ones. And wouldn't order it again here. We also had the calamari which is pretty good. The waiter also told us that they had a fruit cobbler for dessert and it's one of my husband's favorite. So we got it but unfortunately it showed up without any cobbler at all. It was all just fruit and  ice cream. When we asked about it he said sorry we ran out of butter so we couldn't make the cobbler portion. Very strange! 

It was very nice experience with the exception of the soaking cushion and the cobbler. I was a bit surprised they didn't Offer us something complementary for us because of that inconvenience and shock of the wet cushion and/or at least not charged for the non-cobbler but overall we would definitely be back (but checking our seats first). The entrées stood  out the most and were so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Amazing views, but otherwise disappointing.  The restaurant is really nothing special - typical menu and they didn't play off the view to the fullest extent.  We enjoyed a glass of wine on the patio and definitely had the best table in the place.  Service was slow and overwhelmed too...not sure how on a summer evening when every table wasn't even full."}
{"text":"Alchemy food is good but the menu hasn't changed for lunch or dinner in 4 years.  It gets a little old seeing the same things on the menu. The chef should have some creativity in adding and changing things -- we live in fountain hills but are bored with the same old some old."}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day brunch Amazing staff great chef incredible food was perfectly seasoned flavorful incredible view highly recommended will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and the open air, high doors are great in the high 70's temps of March."}
{"text":"\"Unbelievably WOW\" doesn't even begin to explain the exceptional meal and service we received at Alchemy Restaurant.   We were staying at CopperWynd for a birthday stay-cation and had made reservations for Alchemy, Saturday evening.  This was to be our first dining experience there.  We had a minor hiccup with pool service that day and therefore moved up our reservation due to hunger.  The manager was extremely apologetic for our experience and went above and beyond to make things right.  This is unheard of in todays hospitality environment.  We weren't sure what to expect but the meal was absolutely mouth watering and exquisite.  We enjoyed a superb glass of malbec as we savored the best calamari I have ever eaten.  They get this appetizer just perfect.  It is not over fried and is topped with picante sweet peppers.  We then enjoyed the Fall Harvest Salad and the Bacon Caesar Salad.  These salads are not small at all.  They could be a meal in itself.  Both were simply full of flavor and refreshing.  We then both enjoyed their special of the evening a chimichurri seasoned steak with garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini.  The steak was perfectly cooked to our liking  and had the right amount of seasoning.  It made my mouth water.  I couldn't finish mine because it was so much food.  Then to top it all off the manager sent over 3 desserts.  A creme brûlée, a flour less chocolate cake and mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I have never felt so full and satisfied from a meal.  Every course had amazing flavor and was done perfectly.  The management, chef and staff get this restaurant right.  I would highly recommend Alchemy to anyone visiting the valley.  You won't regret eating here.  In fact you will regret not knowing about it earlier.  And the view by the windows is beautiful.  As a tip you may want to request window seating in your reservation.  Thank you Alchemy for making our experience so memorable.  We will be back with others in tow."}
{"text":"First time back in 5 years and I live 10 minutes away. First, they toned down the fanciness. Do that business casuaal thing and you'll be fine. The patio is a good spot, even though you can't make a res for it. The menu is friendly, upscale food avoiding pretentious. The burger looked great at the table next to us. Our food, app was lamb pops. Basically 3, very tender lamb chops. Entrees were butterfish and duck breast. Both around $26 with veggies and a starch floating ariund the plate. The food was good. A glass of wine was $9-11 range (I resent the 13-14 a glass joint). Service attentive. A good night. My takeaway was a nice meal in FH that doesn't have to be that special occasion for the price."}
{"text":"We have NEVER been disappointed in a meal or service at Alchemy!  wonderful place and beautiful location. ..romantic city lights/mountain views."}
{"text":"Fantastic service!!! Everyone we encountered from the manager & servers to the busboy, was very personable and welcoming. Even my 5 yr old son was treated with kindness and smiles - not typical at this caliber of restaurant and it was so appreciated. 

The food was excellent. I especially enjoyed the appetizer of yellow fin tuna cups - so light and a perfect bite to get my taste buds going.  My filet was cooked perfectly and I could have eaten ten of the crab-stuffed tomatoes. The chocolate dessert recommended by the waiter was also divine - and I don't even like sweets or chocolate! A 5-star experience all around. 

When in Fountain Hills, I'd skip the stay at CopperWynd but dinner at Alchemy is a must!"}
{"text":"This dining room is nice but felt like a boutique hotel.  Not warm,no tablecloths, but nice.  Food was creative and very good, but not excellent. But felt this was the nicest restaurant in FH...I'll drive into Scottsdale for a more inviting spot."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my wife and four children aged 12-23.  Unfortunately we arrived after dark so I can't comment on the view, but it must be awesome due to the location.  Ambiance was pleasant, comfortable.  Menu was not overly expansive, but had enough to satisfy the variety of palates in our group.  Wine list was long and our waiter was helpful in assisting our pairings with dinner.  Appetizers were amazing.  Crab cakes were classic, flavorful, not needing any sauce.  Calamari were light and flavorful.  Short ribs were amazing.  Veal chops also great.  The soup of the night was chicken tortilla and was the best tortilla soup several of my party had ever tasted.  The salads were light and flavorful.  The seasonal harvest salad was amazing.  The entrees were well prepared with adequate portion size.  The Hawaiian butter fish was very good and light.  The salmon had a unique smoky flavor.  The pork loin was amazing.  Steaks were cooked ideally.  Desserts were awesome, so leave room if you can.  The chocolate cake has a spicy kick and is very dense.  The goat cheese cheesecake is very unique an flavorful.  Overall, this was one of the finest dining experiences we have ever had, surpassing an experience we had at one of the Iron Chef's establishments.  Kudos to chef Paul!"}
{"text":"What a great Valentines celebration at Alchemy 
They had a prix fix menu that allowed for everyone to enjoy the evening 
I had the salmon which was one of the best pieces of fish I have had while in the desert 
Others enjoyed the braised ribs and lobster tail 
The staff was very helpful the doors and windows were open giving one of the best views in the Valley 
It was a great night and we will be back again"}
{"text":"This place has the most gorgeous view and every table gets to enjoy it. The crab cakes for starters are absolutely delicious and the lamb shank, oh it was amazing. Great place for a date night, try and reserve around 6:00-6:30 so you can take advantage of the beautiful sunset view."}
{"text":"Sept 13, 2013 update (Friday the 13th, yikes).  Sharper service, excellent actually. Food outstanding. Seems like they even outfitted the staff in sharp outfits. Second time confirms the first: great place. Up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"We just moved to Fountain Hills from Chandler so we are checking out the local restaurants. 

We expected Alchemy to be good considering all of the great reviews, but I didn't expect to be overcome with the desire to eat here every weekend -- bit expensive, but outstanding! And if you compare the pricing to Old Town or elsewhere in Fountain Hills, it really isn't that much over average - but everything was cheaper in Chandler :-)

My favorites were the appetizers as usual for me (sashimi app is to die for) - and the excellent cocktails - and then the view! Beautiful view of the mountains from the wall of glass - will definitely go more in Fall/Winter/Spring and sit outside on the terrace - cant wait!"}
{"text":"Alchemy is our favorite restaurant in the entire Phoenix area. The views brat any other's, the food is outstanding, we've also enjoyed smooth, quiet service and the chairs are comfortable. We've loved the Pork Osso Bucco, Duck Breast, all of the salads, and for dessert, your heavenly banana trifle and sea salt caramel gelato. We've been to an Easter and another's Day brunch, both excellent. Every visitor enjoys dinner there. We live in Fountain Hills and can't believe our good fortune. Last, the ambiance is quiet and the decorations beautiful, such interesting lighting. It's perfect for us."}
{"text":"What a view!  A very fine dining atmosphere.  The server, Jennifer S was among the most pleasant we have enjoyed anywhere.  She was polite, not too over bearing, but always there at the right moment.  The Martini's perfect, the food prepared as well as most anyone could do.  We had a cheese plate and filet mignon.  The CP was a nice appetizer to help appreciate the view.  The price is in line with such places we have enjoyed at home in Lake Tahoe, while traveling to Vegas, San Francisco etc.

Not one complaint to be given by us........  Maybe one....  We can't come again on this month we have spent in FH.  But the good news, we are booked for next March again and will absolutely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, let me explain that we initially selected this location for spa services which were gifted to a group of my colleagues for a successful project launch.  Nice huh?!?!  don't you wish you worked where I do?  By the way, the ladies in the spa were fantastic.  Holly and Martina have my full recommendation.

We had made other plans for dinner, but after seeing the location, the views, the comfortable atmosphere, and reading the few reviews here, we decided to make a day of it with afternoon cocktails and dinner after everyone's treatments concluded.  Enjoyed the service from Candace during happy hour - super friendly and accommodating.

The restaurant recently reopened and from what I understand the menu has been  repriced somewhat to provide more value.  Touchdown.  The head chef, Paul, is also the owner.  We had a chance to chat with Paul a few times throughout the night.  Very gracious, humble, and genuine - and seems to really enjoy hospitality.  In our discussions he was forthright about the challenges to bring customers to their area and get the word out.  From a customer's standpoint, it is nice to  keep it \"to yourself\", but Paul is right and this is a great local find that needs to be experienced by more people.

We felt catered too all day.  The staff is all friendly and helpful and several commented that they \"loved\" working there.  Good sign in my book.  Menu was brief, but interesting - again, what I prefer.  Pours on the drinks were generous and no one balked when I asked to modify my dinner selection - in fact, Paul stopped by to confirm and just set expectations about how he would prepare my meal - a Hawaiian butter fish - which was excellent and the best part of my meal.  My app and desert were good, but not as memorable.  

Definitely will make plans to come again with my wife for some spa time, dinner and an overnight stay if possible."}

{"text":"Lovely setting with gorgeous views! 
We came at 11am so we just missed breakfast, but enjoyed some delicious coffee. Our server Tina was so friendly and very generous! We got two coffees and then refills and coffee to go and all for $7
And the coffee was great! The place is so pretty! 
I definitely want to come back here for lunch or dinner. The views are really breath taking. We sat by the window and could even see the fountain. 

Thank you Alchemy for some lovely morning coffee and great service in a spectacular setting !!"}
{"text":"I just went there again over the weekend for another spectacular experience.  I really do love this place and more people need to go out there as well!  It was extremely busy Saturday night and the staff handled it with ease.  

I need to give a special shout out to Alchemy's manager.  Ryan is extremely professional and made the experience that much more enjoyable.  He loves to engage with his clientele and being extremely helpful at the same time.  He really cares about the restaurant and staff.  

It's great to see a place where it is obvious that the staff enjoys where they work.  We had Jean again for our server...and his humor and knowledge is great.  

The only thing I wish is that the wine list had more to offer by the glass. There are many different wines available by the bottle....but for this lightweight...one glass is fine for me.

And when you stop in...make sure you make room for dessert.  The goat cheese cake was out of this world."}
{"text":"Great view/huge windows.

Slightly above mediocre food/service. Place a bit run down. Could use new flooring/etc.

Great happy hour in the lobby area.

Awesome patio.

NOW OPEN ON SUNDAYS despite Yelp showing otherwise!"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner the past month.  Lunch was fine, the food is pretty good and the view is very nice.  However, I live in Fountain Hills, and the views out my windows are superior so I don't have to go there for the views.  It was a freind's birthday and she picked this for lunch, I rarely go to lunch but agreed to make her happy.

Dinner...well another story.  They had people seated outside and the wind picked up so they were scrambling to get the people indoors.  They told us there would be a 1/2 hour wait but seated us faster, after I complained.  Interesting, as there were 3 or 4 empty tables when we walked in.  I think they are under staffed.  The servers are good and try hard but there are not enough of them.  The food is VERY expensive.  The tab was $180 for 2 main courses and one order of calamari.  We had a bottle of $40 wine, but still....not worth it.  We have dined at Eddie V and Capital Grill for that amount, had better food and leftovers.  The portions are not large.

If you want to go early and dine with the sunset maybe it is worth it, but we are used to driving to Scottsdale for decent food and I guess we'll just keep doing that."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very nice and open with large windows facing a beautiful rock canyon and golf course in fountain hills. Service was fantastic, as was the food. I had the filet, girlfriend had the duck. You can get good steak many places, but good duck is hard to find and it was absolutely delicious here. Melted in your mouth. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Heard they have re-opened...haven't gone yet to confirm but hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"You definitely pay for the view, was an above average meal. I got the steak and it was pretty good. We also got the cheese plate which was nothing spectacular. I reserved a table for us with a request to sit outside, upon arrival we were asked where we wanted to sit, I thought that was kind of odd. There was a bug crawling on the table during our meal and the bus boy came by as he was setting our appetizer down and killed the bug which I thought was kind of odd. 

View: 5
Food: 3
4 stars."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I went to Alchemy for lunch. The day we visited, the weather was perfect and we sat outside. The view from the patio was beautiful and the entire scene was so relaxing. The service was great and the food was spectacular. We both had the salmon. The flavors in this dish were out together just right. Both of us ate every last bite!  Then, for dessert we decided to share the creme brûlée. This was also done perfectly. The vanilla flavor was subtle and there were also hints of citrus. All on all it was a very memorable lunch. 

The only drawback was our GPS couldn't find the address and when I called to ask for direction there was only a recording (which didn't address the directions issue)."}
{"text":"I had a Buffalo Burger and loved it!!  Really an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Very poor food quality. Veal tasted like cold boxed foods. This place use to be great but no longer. Good STAFF and great view. Go for a drink but avoid the food."}
{"text":"Have gone to Alchemy at Copperwynd many times over the years and have always loved the ambiance and setting.  The views are amazing.  The whole concept is great with the resort and spa, etc.  

They recently re-opened after suffering the down turn in the economy and we were very excited to have them back.  Have stayed at the resort five times in the past several years and they have been running some great specials and prices.

We decided to go there this year for Thanksgiving brunch buffet.  I had been on Thanksgiving, twice before.   

After making reservations we arrived at our specified time and were seated out on the outside, side patio.  Far from the crowd (okay with us) but it was a cloudy, cooler day.  We asked to be seated next to the outdoor fireplace (two tables were empty), because when we asked for a table side heater, we were told they only had one heater that worked and it was taken.  Our waitress asked us to wait and returned and told us we could move but another party was coming in an hour for that table.  We agreed.  We were not offered anything else or the option of moving inside.  The table by the fireplace was perfect!!  Not to mention warmer and protected as it did start to rain.  Hmmm, wonder if they would have let us get wet too! 

This year the food was set up in the far room which was different from the other times we were there.  It did provide more room.  The food.......well, it seemed much more sparse than previous Thanksgiving and just not as appealing or well presented.  The quality of the food we had was good, but there just seemed to be something lacking, which I can't figure out what that was.  Perhaps by the time we were there (1:30), things had been picked over??  But believe me, we did not leave hungry!!  It was so nice not to cook or have the clean-up mess to contend with.

Our waitress................hmm,  So bland and un-attentive, I can't even remember her name.  Had never seen her there before, although she mentioned she had been there for awhile.  Was very disinterested in our progress through dinner and we had to ask several times for refills for our mimosa's.  The bus staff did a good job of keeping up with removing empty dishes and keeping the table clean.
Overall, I got the impression the waitress might have been pissed off she had to work on the holiday, or perhaps she was just having a bad day.  If I was seated with her as my wait person again, I would ask to sit elsewhere.

We watched an exchange between her and two women who were seated even farther away from the crowd than us, and it got heated.  On their way out the women stopped at our table and told us they were upset about the gratuity fee being added to the bill for the buffet and the waitress was very rude to them about it and started yelling at them (this occurred inside and was reported to us by the women, so we did not witness).

Speaking of the gratuity being added................I agree with them.  This was a buffet and we served ourselves!!  If anything the bus boys did the hardest part and our waitress did not deserve the % that was charged.  Most of the time when this happens, it is usually 18% added and we usually tip 20% and they lose out.
Our total bill for our Thanksgiving dinner was $142 for both of us.  Kind of on the high side, but we enjoyed our day, meal and most of all the atmosphere and each others company!"}
{"text":"I gave two stars for the view.  Awesome view! As for service and food....I've defiantly had better,  If you want to have GREAT food and GREAT view. Go to Different Pointe of View restaurant. Alchemy was over price for the food and service.  We order a bottle of wine from the menu it was an 09' (a $50 bottle) and they brought out a 12' and said oh well I don't think we have it...then she asked the waiter walking by and he said yea we have it.. so then she asked us if that is what we really wanted. We then ordered the calamari...and it was like bar food...nothing you would get at this kind of restaurant....and the steak...smallest steak every ordered for $40.  We even asked the waitress if it was a 6 or 8 ounce...she says...\"oh its more like 8 for sure\" ....it was like 4 ounces. I would not recommend this place. Either lower your prices or change up the staff...including the people cooking the calamari."}
{"text":"Great views of course before sunset, and a great Christmas Eve dinner. Menu was limited for the holiday, but still a good selection was offered.  Wine offerings were pretty extensive. Waitstaff was spot-on in service. I recommend to all."}
