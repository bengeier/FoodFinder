{"text":"I really love the miso ramen in Fujiya Ramen. I went back to Pittsburgh last month and went to this restaurant. I had miso ramen which tasted so so good. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We arrived this place at 5:37pm and finished our order around 5:50pm. It's 6:23pm now and we're still waiting our food...

It's a normal Wed afternoon. Not a holiday nor a weekend. It's unacceptable and no one explained to us why."}
{"text":"Really good!!!!
Tastes incredibly great!
My roommate and I once tried a ramen bar in LA and that was really good, we always wanted to go there again. And now we don't need to, just few blocks away from home!"}
{"text":"Has a great experience. The ramen noodles are made to order unlike the last iteration in this space so they have a better tooth feel, not mushy. Had the spicy miso and it was spicy, not Pittsburgh spicy, but real spicy. It had a half of an egg, but a perfect egg with a good gelatinous yolk. The pork belly and chicken skin yakitori were very good, although I would have preferred the chicken skin a bit crisper. All in all a great improvement compared to the prior restaurant."}
{"text":"Saw this spot on my morning walk, decided to give it a try! There's no booze available right now, hence 4 stars. Friendly service, food arrived super quickly. Gyoza were very flavorful, came with a nice crisp, not greasy. Edamame service nice and hot, cooked perfectly, not too crunchy or mushy. Donburi chicken bowl had nice big pieces of chicken. Chicken ramen was flavorful, light, not too salty. Noodles were cooked nicely. Good luck and best wishes for continued successes!"}
{"text":"The ramen was so so in my opinion.. I ordered the vegetarian... I've definitely had far more flavorful.  I ordered through the yelp app for delivery.  It would have been nice to have the option to customize or add some spice. I did add a side of bean sprouts. Delivery took forever, though service was very friendly.  I'd probably try elsewhere before I order again."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. The staff is super friendly, the service is quick and DELICIOUS! I  I ordered the Miso Ramen noodles, it was great and plenty for me to eat. I also tried the Takoyaki. MUY BIEN! I would come back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely fantastic! Our server, Lauren, was incredibly friendly and helpful. She made us feel very comfortable. The rice bowl was truly flavorful and filling. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place from my friend! I love ramen! I kept looking for the best ramen in town And this newly opened place definitely has the best authentic Japanese ramen in Pittsburgh! Tasted the same as what I had in Japan! Great food, great services, great atmosphere, I definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This is a very authentic ramen and yakatori shop! The broth in the ramen is so savory. We had a chicken and a pork belly yakatori which were really tasty. The restaurant is lovely in appearance and very clean. Prices for wine and beer were a bargain!"}
{"text":"I'm Japanese and tonkotsu is my favorite ramen flavor, so I had to try this place out! The tonkotsu ramen here is pretty average, but that's exciting in Pittsburgh where I've had noodles in Chinese flavored soup dressed up as \"ramen\". Extra star for being the best ramen I've had in Pittsburgh.

TLDR: The ramen here is probably enjoyable to many people, and it actually tastes like ramen! :O 

Details: The soup was flavorful and easy to drink. Pretty standard, although I felt like they could have done a little more. I personally really like thick, kotteri tonkotsu soup so it was a little lacking in depth and richness. Noodles were pretty normal. The chashu was fine, although there was still some of that distinct meat smell that didn't need to be there. Also I would have preferred a little more fat in those slices. There's half of an ajitama (flavored soft boiled egg) in the bowl. I feel like ajitama just needs simple flavoring, but the one I had an extraneous flavor/scent to it. Not sure if I just had a weird off one, but it had kind of like a sweet alcohol scent to it. I've had good ajitama before that were a little sweet, but this one definitely threw me off. Finally, the bowls here are too tall and deep. It's difficult to finish the bowl off at the end. 

At the end of the day, this place will satisfy your authentic ramen cravings."}
{"text":"Waited for 60 minutes but my food still hasn't came yet!!!!!!!!!!They didn't even explain why I need to wait for so long for a chashu don nor apologize for my waiting."}
{"text":"As a native Japanese and a self-called ramen critic, the ramen (miso) served was more than I expected.  Perhaps because the other ramen shop in Pitts (ramen bar) is recently declining its taste but overall, miso ramen alone was pretty good.  Although I am willing to give 4 stars, there are a few issues that I need to point out.

1) $12-$13 ramen price is outrageous.  The current (6/11/18) USD-JPY rate converts, 1300-1400 yen and there are no such ramen sold in Japan.  Based upon the portion and taste, it should be less than $10.  Besides understanding the uniqueness of ramen, it is still way too high for the 'ramen' standard.  

2) The ramen bowl is not really ideal.  I understand they try to be fancy by using a cone shape deep bowl but it is very difficult to scoop ingredients from the bottom when the soup level goes low.  In addition, the wooden spoon makes it more difficult to pick the liquid due to the shape and the deep bowl.  I'd rather see a standard ramen bowl instead of deep cone shape bowl.  

3) The portion is small.  If they charge $12-$13 per bowl, it should be more inside.  It's an expensive serving.  

The broth is decent, chasyu is good as well as a boiled egg.  I tasted bamboo shoots from pre-made (packaged one that you can buy from store), noodles are from Sun noodle (http://sunnoodle.com/) and not really matching with miso base soup.  It should be thicker like Sapporo style noodle.  

The place has a potential and I should try a few more other ramens.  The server was very friendly and she made me feel at home.  I will look forward to trying more soon."}
{"text":"Made an order for pick-up it was fast and hot! The broth was delicious and the chicken was was delicious."}
{"text":"Honestly pretty good ramen but nothing special. It's on par with other ramen shops around Pittsburgh. Only quirck is the spoons they give you are pretty shallow. This stopped me from getting that good slurp. 

Also, the place used to be Tan Izakaya which I've been to twice and I'm pretty sure the interior hasn't changed at all."}
{"text":"Good food with Japanese Izakaya style decoration. Eel in don is fairly soft. Excellent noodle soup. Yakitoris are of juicy taste. There is an ATM machine inside. They even provide mouthwash water in restroom. But it will be better to provide toilet cover paper. Above all, very satisfied~"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. No lunch menu. So we were supposedly given dinner sized meals. Think about getting dessert somewhere else on Walnut cuz the portion sizes are small. $12 buys a tall bowl of with ramen filling the bottom quarter. This optical illusion trick doesn't full my brain.  They cut their pork with a meat slicer because there is no way they can cut meat this thin by hand. I don't go to eat ramen because I am on a diet. I thought the broth was little salty but my friend thought it was ok. Anyways not going there again. There are lots of other ramen joints who don't skimp on portions when demanding a high price for soup noodles. I'll think about going there again when I feel the urge to feel dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Much worse than the previous izakaya. Ramen portion is half the size. All fishcakes missing. Only half an egg present instead of one. Significantly reduced amount of pork belly meat. Etc etc. The only thing that stays the same is the price."}
{"text":"Authentic delicious food!
Vegetarian friendly 
Excellent service

Loved the ramen, pickled daikon and fried tofu.

Great location,  near Shadyside hospital"}
{"text":"Excellent services. Our waiter was so nice and talkative, professional. We love the food he recommended. They have my favorite pork bun, crazy for the sauce. It is sooo good. The ramen noodle same as usual, but I love the broth, the best miso broth I even have. You could shared a ramen noodle, big portion. Appetizers good too, Fried pork dumplings and Edamame. We definitely will come back when we visit PA again."}
{"text":"Now that this place has changed names and owners from Tan Izakaya, the food is much better.  At the moment, Fujiya is probably the best ramen in Pittsburgh.  In addition to the typical tonkotsu you'll find at most good ramen places in the US, they also have a seafood ramen in a light broth with clams and shrimp that is pretty fantastic.  The noodles are chewy and the broth is fragrant, though could maybe use a bit more tare.  All in all, a big step up from the previous place... Which used udon noodles for their ramen."}
{"text":"Waited for 50 minutes and food has not showed up yet. I'm still at the restaurant but we are about to leave this place.  We ordered ramen and curry rice. I have no clue how it can take this long. No explanations were given."}
{"text":"A great new ramen place in Pitt! The spicy miso ramen I got was delicious and had the depth of flavor in the broth that a ramen should have. The yakitori skewers were also really good!!"}
{"text":"The environment is very comfortable, the taste of food is very real, the service is very warm."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ramen and the staff were very accommodating for us (we had a baby with us) we live in Sewickley and we would do that drive really often for ramen or this quality!"}
{"text":"Made a short stay at the city and had a great time here. The taste of the spicy miso ramen is amazing, pork belly yakitori and chicken yakitori made me very pleased and full! 
People in the pub are all very kind and the serving time is very reasonable. I will definitely re-visit this place again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and ordered spicy miso ramen and three yakitori skewers. Being a ramen enthusiast I think the quality and authenticity of their ramen is decent and comparable to Ramen Bar at Squirrel Hill. Char Shu slices are flavorful but could have been thicker cut. Yakitori was Ok with tasty sauce, although I personally would prefer it a bit more charred. Overall a nice ramen place that's closer to home. Will likely drop by again."}
{"text":"A great place to catch up and hang out with friends!  The food showed up quickly and it didn't take too long to wait. I am a Ramen lover and it is one of the best Ramen bar I have ever been to. Really love the cozy environment.... Some appetizers are also worth trying!"}
{"text":"The ramen is not better than the previous Izakaya. Fried chicken is not authentic but more of fusion style. Ice cream tempura is too sweet, sign of fusion again."}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic ramen joint in Pittsburgh. Some reviewers mentioned the portion being too small, but not to me - especially with their thick pork-based broth. Their appetizers and yakitori (skewers) were also very tasty. (Good to see smelts on the menu!) Our servers were very attentive and friendly. The only downside is that they do not have a liquor license yet, but I heard they are working on it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good ramen spot and this place is phenomenal. I'm picky with any Japanese dish and this not only met all my expectations, it was authentic and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant, delicious food and very good service. I believe I will choose here next time. Let's try it out. I believe you will love it here."}
{"text":"I am newly crowning Fujiya as the KING of RAMEN in Pittsburgh. I've been to every other ramen place in Pittsburgh, and the others just don't compare. Having lived in DC, NYC, and eaten ramen in Philly and Tokyo, as well as being Japanese-American, I know a thing or two when it comes to ramen. The ramen here is nearly up there among the best, which is saying a lot. The broth is so rich and the noodles are good. I tried the spicy miso ramen. Some criticism tho: the Chiar shu is TOO SMALL and TOO FEW. It's a tiny single slice. Also, couldn't hurt to have a bit more noodle for the price point. Otherwise, this place is definitely going to be my new go-to ramen joint."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen!! spicy miso ramen is so authentic and juicy. The soup is amazing and I can't even stop. The noodle is fresh and egg is cooked well enough. I'll definitely come again."}
