{"text":"Visited with a friend back in February. We were looking for a hang out spot for lunch and stumbled upon this place through Yelp. We went in expecting a restaurant but it's actually a really small take out place with about 6 seats!  I ordered the pork kimchi soup and my friend ordered the beef bento box. The place is operated by a family and they are super welcoming and nice. It took a while for the food to cook but it was well worth it!   The kimchi soup was really good, not too spicy or sour with a decent amount of pork in it. You get to pick which side dishes you want (limited to three). The total for the both of us came up to under $20.   Verdict: I'll definitely be back again for some good authentic Korean food without travelling all the way to Korea town."}
{"text":"Literally a hidden gem. Wow. Prices are great and food is even better. Must try are the rice bowl special and pork bone soup. Still have to try their other items but overall this place does not disappoint. Will be returning very soon"}
{"text":"Feel korean homemade food taste at its best. Everything is awesome! Owners are humble, generous and funny."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot for take out, awesome authentic Korean food from a small, friendly, family business. The portions are huge especially for such modest prices--only $7 or $8 and usually I get 2 meals out of it! The beef rice bowl special is the BEST, I could eat it all the time. My boyfriend loves the pork bone soup. You can also call ahead of time and your order will be ready when you pick up 15 mins later."}
{"text":"Drove 15 km to try this place and it did not disappoint! My hubby is not much into Korean food but after tasting the food, he can barely talk! It was really good! We tried the pork bone combo for 2 and a side of spicy-sweet chicken! The owners were so apologetic about the pork - a lot of the meat had already fallen from the bone, it was still amazing btw- so they gave us extra chicken! Yum! Chapchae, rice cake, pork bone, chicken, even the side dishes were super! Will come back again - soon!"}
{"text":"This is a very tiny restaurant. My first impression was I was in one of those outdoor setup tent kitchen. It is an open kitchen so you can see the owner cooking in front of you. I suggested you order the food in advance because the seats are limited.   We ordered sweet spicy chicken, pork bone soup with 3 side dishes, rice cake and japchae and the beef special rice bowl. The sweet spicy chicken, beef rice bowl, rice cake and japchae were very good and tasty.   It's one of best Korean food I ever had. I feel like I am eating mom's homemade food. It's flavourful and I can feel the owner's passion and pride in preparing the food to her patrons.  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here, if you're reading this just stop and go here if you want excellent Korean food for the best prices in town.  However, I'm taking off a star in the hopes that the management will read my review and learn from it. They don't write down the orders, and so when I ordered several dishes, one of them got lost. This was annoying and I think it can happen easily because unless you're getting takeout, they don't write down your orders or confirm it with you. Best is to have them repeat it back to you or something. Same with the drinks since you just take it out of the fridge and they account for it at the end of the meal. It doesn't need some complicated electronic POS tracking equipment, just use a notepad and a pen.  Anyways, the rice bowl, dukboki, and soups are fantastic. Eat here and enjoy."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Love the taste, service and unique taste of authentic Korean family style food!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and they have a wide variety of different rice dishes, soups,and tasty little appetizers. The shop is run by a dynamic duo of father and daughter. they have amazing service and they make you feel welcome and there food works together in perfect harmony. I strongly advise you to try this place. my only dislike would be the lack of space as the restaurant only has 6 seats but the food is so good it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"Hidden gem as others have said. Rice bowls and pork bone soup along with their lunch boxes seem to be the most popular. Their sweet and spicy chicken seems to sell out quite often before the end of the day on weekends.  And where else can you get a pork bone soup with choice of 3 banchan for $6.95."}
{"text":"We were a bit late when we went for dinner. Pork bone soup is my favourite, but I controlled myself and ordered the Kimchi soup. They made it fresh in front of our eyes. My wife wanted to try a bunch of things, so asked for the lunch platter. The old couple were kind enough to allow her to customize her choices.  It took a bit time, but it was worth for the wait. Kimchi soup was amazing and we were glad that we ordered the lunch platter (I was able to taste the pork bone soup that came with it, I know what to order next time)  Watermelon sofa became a immediate favourite, need to do some research on the sugar content before ordering it again.  It was a bit awkward place to dine in, especially if there are bunch of people. But the combination of fresh food, warmth of the owners and the wonderful taste turned into a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Small family run place with limited seating (takeout recommended for larger groups). Food is great: beautifully plated, great flavours (particularly their spicy sauce), and very filling. In my case, I got the rice bowl special, which includes your protein of choice (tried both beef and short ribs), rice, glass noodles, various vegetables, deep fried dumplings, seaweed, and spicy sauce. Owner is very friendly as well.  Would definitely recommend, particularly for groups of 1-2."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! Good food with awesome price....and exceptional service.  Mostly take out place but they do have a few seats for those quick drop in.  Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"It was our first time in this nice little take out korean food spot that I found through yelp. The food is great!!   We ordered beef rice bowl, pork belly rice bowl & beef lunch box and they were all very tasty. The portions were huge and good price.   The owners are very friendly especially the grandpa, really nice guy I highly recommend the place and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a pick up of pork bone soup.  When I got there around 6 p.m., the place was quiet with two people waiting for their orders and no one in line.  There was a selection of three sides, but the old guy was a little stingy with the portions, and they've obviously been sitting around all day. The total was $8.99.  This was actually for my life. I would just have whatever leftovers were in the fridge. I ate the sides and they were all good though again small in portion.  I had a little of the soup and it was very good. I wouldn't rave about this place and I'm not sure that it is any better than Owl of Minerva, but it is solid tasty Korean food.  3.75 stars."}
{"text":"Call in for pick up. Portion size are pretty small. Noodle was plain and very small portiin, more like a side dish."}
{"text":"This place has really good Korean food. It is a small, family run business with probably a maximum of 3 people working at a time. It is really small in there, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you want to sit in - there is literally just a few barstools and a tiny table pushed up against the wall. However for takeout it's perfect. I usually will call ahead of time so I don't have to stand and wait (not much room for that either). Depending on what you order and how many portions, wait times could be up to half an hour. Prices are beyond reasonable and the food is amazing. My favorite is the spicy chewy noodles. Apparently they make dishes quite spicy, which I'm a fan of, but if you're not too great with spice I would let them know. You also get side dishes (choice of 3). Also something to mention is my mom, even though she's not a fan of Korean food, will only make the exception for this place."}
{"text":"good because it's korean.... I guess. purchased the bulgoki and do so bimbibap.... customer service - ok, food- ok, price points- good"}
{"text":"Portions are huge and filling and tastes amazing for a decent price! Its a really small restaurant though cant fit more than 5-8 people and thats really crowding it"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Big portions.  Very responsibly prices. Everything is home made !! Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have lived within walking distance from this place for the past 7 years. Howwver, I have always tried to actively avoid it. Mostly because I'm not a big fan of Korean food, and the sound of take out Korean food just did not appeal to me. Luckily, I gave this place a shot last week. And boy am I disappointed at myself for not trying it sooner.   The grandpa and lady were busy with another order, so they didn't really greet us. Nonetheless, this little take out place has a special homey feel to it. The grandpa was so sweet ! We came later at night so there weren't too many side dishes to choose from, and he kept apologizing for it. We ordered the combo for two, which came with bibimpop, noodles, and spicy chicken with our choice of three sides. The portions were decent. The spicy chicken and bibimpop were delicious ! The spicy chicken just melts in your mouth and the bibimpop had a good portion of veggies and rice to it.    In fact, I am coming back here tonight to grab some more mouth watering spicy chicken"}
{"text":"Speechless! The owners are so wonderful that I wish I were related to them! But more importantly, delicious food! Delicious. I ordered the Beef Rice Bowl and I must go back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I walked in with a friend thinking it was a restaurant, but was shocked when we saw that it was a small establishment with maximum 5 person seating. However, as people say great things come in small packages and this is one of those cases. The place is run by a father and daughter who do a great job up keeping the place and prepping food. The taste of the food was fantastic and very wallet friendly! The man who was manning the cash was extremely friendly and was helpful in explaining dishes when I had trouble picking up side dishes which came with me entree. I would definitely come back again, but perhaps for take out!"}
{"text":"Gamjatang (pork bone soup) is only $7.95 after tax!!!   It is very cheap and even very tasty!!  Owner lady(daughter of gentle man) and the gentle man was so nice and humble people.  I strongly recommend this place to try ! It is small restaurant so take out would be better but eating in is okay too!!:)"}
{"text":"My family and I went here after googling \"Korean food\" near Pacific Mall. We had no idea that the place was mostly take out since we went here out of impulse. We have no regrets.   This seems to be a family business, owned by a father and daughter. They only had about 6 seats and my family of 4 essentially took up the whole space. We ordered bibimbap, and other rice bowls. I had the kimchi rice bowl. Since they usually do take out, they didn't have enough plates and bowls so we used paper plates. While we waited, we got to watch the owner cook up our meals. It felt like I was watching a Korean cooking show. But what made it better was the fact that I actually got to try what the chef was making.  My kimchi rice bowl had rice, some veggies, sides, a spicy red sauce, kimchi, tofu, and seaweed. The best part were the noodles (japchae?). We were told to mix it all together but I decided not to so I could observe and appreciate each piece of the meal. I felt like I was eating in a Korean friend's house.  As for service - amazing. The father (more like halabeoji) was adorable. He talked to us while we waited for our food by sharing stories about Korea and his filipino friends from the Korean War. He even said \"salamat\" whenever we said \"gamsahamnida\". When we left, they asked us how we found them and we told them that they had great ratings on Yelp. They were shocked. You can tell they were a humble family. They didn't realize how much joy their food brought their customers. We even teased them into opening up a bigger restaurant. Extremely grateful, we said exchanged thank-yous in our languages and stepped out with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Found this place online and decided to give it a try. Its a really small store with seating for about 6 people; they mainly do takeouts. I came in with 2 friends and we ordered the first set menu (pork bone soup, tteokbokki and chapchae) and a large bibimbap. The owners were really friendly and advised us a large bibimbap may be too large... And true to his words it was too much for us to finish. The tteokbokki here was more of a seafood tteokbokki as there was shrimp, oysters and other seafood in it. All the food I tried was good and would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is neat. It's like a hole in the wall, but it's on a corner unit, so it's pretty much just a wall. There's one table and a few bar stools (which are usually occupied by people waiting for their takeout) so my advice is to call ahead.   Now, this place is a steal. The dinner for two meals will run you about $25 (post tax), but boy do you get a lot of food. We opted for the pork bone soup combo (comes with PBS, chap chae and spicy rice rolls). After waiting for about ten minutes (it's made to order) we were on way home.  At first glance, I was skeptical at the PBS, since the soup and bones are served in separate take out containers. The PBS looks a bit dry, but after joining the bones and the soup and giving it a mix, it wasn't bad. The broth is slightly more pale than I am used to, but don't let that fool you - it's certainly carries its weight in flavour. The bones were tender and falling apart (just the way I like it) and I wouldn't hesitate to get this again.  Our order of chap chae was made fresh so when we got home, a mighty mixing was required to unstick the noodles, but the flavour is worth the work: sweet and savoury accompanied by with a satisfactory bite, an undeniable indication that the noodles were prepared with skill and experience.  The chewy rice cakes round out the meal, providing the satisfaction and fill, adorned by sweet and spicy seafood goodness (and for that extra protein kick, half a boiled egg).  This is a place that has made it on to my 'I must come back here when I am in need of dinner and no one will make it for me' list."}
{"text":"I alway love coming to 100% Korean. Theres a cool grandpa and his daughter? that works there. They're both super nice! you might have to speak a bit louder for him. Sometimes it may seem like the chef/lady is a bit annoyed but I assure you she's friendly.   The proportions for the food is great! She makes everything on the spot and you can watch her. I love getting their soups, pork ribs+ rice, and tteok-bokki. There is also a two person menu and you can mix and match different choices. You usually get three side dishes and a bowl of rice.   I don't recommend sitting in for this restaurant simply because it is so small. It's more of a pick up/takeout place.  If you are looking to sit in, then leave your trays on the table and they would pick it up. I tried to be helpful and bring my tray upfront but they would tell me politely leave it there. (I make this mistake a lot haha)"}
{"text":"Hygiene: 1/5 - the old man licks his fingers, touches his face and mouth a lot, then tucks in food sticking out of containers with those fingers. YUCK. Food: 5/5 - side dishes are authentic and variety (15 types?), unlike other Korean places with 5 side dishes that are all just kimchis"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and it was amazing! I called in to place my order and it took 15 minutes to prepare. The man working there is very sweet and friendly.   We ordered the Special Rice Cakes, Beef Rice Bowl, Pork Belly Rice Bowl & Japchae. Everything was under $10 and the portions are huge. Definitely worth the money. The dish I least enjoyed would be the special rice cakes, just because they didn't cut them up. Is that what the special part is? But overall, tasted like any other rice cakes in my opinion. Nothing too special there. But as for the rice bowls. Both the beef and pork belly were soo juicy. So good. As I watched the woman put together the rice bowls, I felt as if there wasn't a lot of meat considering it's called the BEEF bowl, PORK BELLY bowl. But honestly, it's more than enough. They have the rice at the bottom, a mountain of japchae, 2 gyozas(dumpling), beansprouts, cabbage and top it off with sauce ($7.95). Definitely couldn't finish it at all. Also, for those who can't handle spice like me, the rice cakes are slightly too spicy for me, and the sauce on the rice bowls are spicy. Maybe jf they added a little less it would be more bearable.   So glad this place is in the area. Definitely would recommend to whoever is feeling korean food. Friendly staff, great prices and great food!"}
{"text":"Super flavourful pork bone soup and the meat falls off the bone, it's super soft. The beef on rice is also very flavourful. Such generous portions for everything, one pork one soup can fill two people seriously. It comes with 3 choices of sides and there's like 15 of them to choose from. The owner is a kind old man who's also really social, this place feels very homey.  Such a good value, definitely my new take out spot if I'm craving korean, which is usually quite often. 100% delicious and worth it"}
{"text":"3.5 stars + .5 for nice service :)  Came here today with my dad for a quick lunch. They only have 5 seats total (3 booth seats, 1 table for 2), so you'll probably have to take out unless you get here a little early like we did.  I got a regular-sized bibimbap and my dad got the standard gamjatang (pork bone soup). You get a choice of 3 different banchan per meal. We ended up with 3 different types of kimchi (cucumber, two different cabbages), potato salad, little marinated fish, and bean sprouts.   The regular-sized bibimbap was a behemoth of a meal, coming in a super hot stone bowl which made some of rice nice and crackly.  They used brown rice as well which is more healthy. It was loaded with ingredients including lettuce, carrot, beansporut, zucchini, seaweed, a fried egg, marinated beef, onions, bell peppers, etc. One of my favourite ways to get multiple servings of veggies! Remember to add a healthy dose of gochujang to make it more delicious.   My father's pork bone soup had a delicious taste to it and the meat was tender. It was good that it was actually rather spicy and it made me sweat a little. That's how a gamjatang should be! But not everyone likes spiciness, so be warned. The highlight of this was definitely the flavourful broth."}
{"text":"Friends and I came here the other day. The place was really small so we ended up taking out the food and eating at home. If you're planning on coming here to dine, don't! This isn't the place for that.   I had the beef on rice. Was really tasty! My sister had the beef rice bowl. What's the difference you ask? The beef on rice is much larger (not a significant difference) and doesn't have dumplings, as did the beef rice bowl. But the beef on rice has more to it (roasted pineapple, noodles, etc).   The food is 4.5 star quality. Gave it a 4 star due to the service we got. A lot of the Yelp reviews claim that the father and daughter were really kind. Not to us! We came in at 8:35pm (store closes at 9). And both of them were really agitated as if they wanted to be out before 9pm. Weren't the kindest of people towards us.   Will definitely come back to try some of their other dishes. Here's to hoping we get to experience the happy father and daughter duo then!"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab take out one night and decided to check this place out after all the positive reviews I've read. Went in a little after 9pm not realizing they were closed but the owners kindly let us order anyways and still took their time preparing the food.    I ordered a small bibimbap (which came with 3 side dishes of your choice). It was one of, if not the best bibimbap's I've tried. On the menu it says you can choose any 6 toppings you want for it but they never asked me and I never questioned it. The owner ended up choosing the toppings for me and I'm kind of glad she did because they complemented each other very well. The side dishes I ordered were sorta disappointing, the kimchi wasn't that great and they just put all 3 side dishes in one container (mixing the flavours). Even though I ordered a small, the portion was huge for me! I wonder how big the large must be.   My friend got the short rib on rice. I can't give an extensive review on it flavour wise, but appearance wise it was it was a bit overwhelming. They was was looked like only a couple bites of rice, a few short ribs, and a whole lot of different side dishes (with half a hard boiled egg and orange slice on the side?).  A small observation I picked up was that the grandpa working there picked up food without gloves on and then touched cash when I went to pay for the food which was kind of unsanitary and the reason I'm not giving 5 stars.   I would recommend this place if you're looking to order take out, definitely not an ideal pick if you're trying to dine in!"}
{"text":"The taste of the food is really good. The two people that serve it are super friendly! I'm personally not a fan of having all my food in one dish, like having fried dumplings on my glass noodles, but it honestly is just a personal preference. This place definitely deserves a try."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  This is a little Korean shop that is family owned, serving up simple and traditional dishes that are made to order.   Ordered a couple items to try. The short rib lunch box special had quite a variety of items. Folks may find that the rice portion is too small but it was fine for me as I prefer less carbs with my meal. The short ribs were well seasoned but do not expect the meat quality to be on par with the legit Korean BBQ joints given the price point.  The cold noodles were fairly decent. Noodles were chewy in texture and the fixings were fresh with a fairly clean soup base that will satisfy you especially on a hot day.  This place is meant for takeout but there are a few spots along the side as well as a small table if you are looking to grab a quick bite.  I will likely come back to try their pork bone soup and other dishes. Review will be updated accordingly."}
{"text":"It's a great place to got something alone. The man of here it's really friendly and enthusiastic. Food are simple but tastes not too bad."}
{"text":"This became my go to pickup place for Korean food! I've ordered the spicy pork belly on rice and beef rice bowl. Both were so delicious!! I almost can't pick between the two. The portion for the beef rice bowl is definitely a LOT bigger in my opinion. The owners are both super friendly. I will definitely be coming back  love it! Update: went back again and ordered their jap chae. They made it fresh this time and it was the best I've ever had! So chewy and delicious. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! 5 stars! But this restaurant is tiny and can accommodate about 5 people at a time max. If you are getting take out its great, otherwise not the best place for dine in. Cash and debit only..."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. Don't know how I've never been here before!? Food was great and came in pretty big portions. Pork bone soup was literally fall-off-the-bone. Owners are super friendly. Only downside is it's a little small and not much room for dining in (literally a bar stool setup with three seats and one small table for two) .. but most regulars were getting take out anyways. Will definitely be our new go-to for Korean food!"}
{"text":"This place is really overlooked, well at least in my opinion as I always walk by this place without giving it much thought until today when I felt like giving it a try, and it was raining outside so it was a nice shelter as opposed to the tim hortons nearby that is always packed. I ordered the Kimchi soup and it was really good!, had the spiciness I love in kimchi soup and was sweating the good sweat. The meal came with a nice bowl of rice and 3 side dishes of your choice, all of it costed less than $9 which in my opinion was really worth it. The old Korean guy is really nice!"}
{"text":"First time here today. Like other yelpers mentioned, cute little take out place serving homemade 100 % delicious Korean food for very reasonable prices. There are a couple of seats, but we opted to take out. Ordered the beef bowl and pork belly bowl. Portions are very generous, the bowl was overflowing! And the flavours of everything in the bowl blended well together. Reminded us of Chipotle burrito bowl, but with Korean food. Rice on the bottom, then some cabbage, cucumbers, lettuce, noodles, crispy noodles, fish cake, seaweed, 2 dumplings, meat and sauces. I probably missed a few ingredients in there, but you get the idea! Very friendly owners as well.   Will we be back? Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place gets 4.5 stars!  Staff is rude.  Long wait time.  Food is just average.  For sure won't return.  There are many other better Korean place!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food! Was recommend by a friend to try the beef rice bowl. They did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I have been back to this hidden gem in Scarborough many times. Their Korean food is even better than what I had when I went to Korea with very reasonable prices too. It is a family run business - the daughter makes all the delicious food and the father is the cashier and he is very fun to talk to while you wait for your order. You get to pick your own side dishes and their service is very quick. Rightly recommend their pork bone soup and galbi tang. They use organic beef ribs for their galbi tang and is usually sold out. A must try!"}
{"text":"I knew of this place when my friend told me about it. I went and got take out for the tofu stew, bulgogi rice as well as the assortment of side dishes.  The food was amazing. I was amazed how food it was considering it was a small place more of a to go situation kind of store. The owner was super nice and you could tell he really cared to make good quality Korean dishes. The food was well marinated better than some other Korean dishes I had at actual restaurants. I truly enjoyed it and would go back again."}
{"text":"I'm only going to give this place 3 stars because they deceived me. I know Gam Ja Tang are usually spicy but I asked before hand if they had a non-spicy broth and the lady working there reassured me that the \"spice\" was not spicy. Well, it was. Entirely. I even tried diluting the broth with hot water at a 1:10 ratio and I still ended up having sweat/tears/snot leak from all the crevices of my face.   That being said, my review for the overall food would be that it was pretty decent. As mentioned above, I ordered the Gam Ja Tang + got to choose three side dishes to go with it. They have an assortment of side dishes so that was a nice plus. However, I felt that they cheaped out a little on the portions of the side dishes. Also, I'm not a big fan of the pricing. For a takeout restaurant with only 1 small fold-able table and a few bar stools, I expected the food to be cheaper than it actually was.   Eh, probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Such a gem in this plaza!!! Highly recommend the spicy pork belly on rice. Strong taste and just perfect with rice. The price was pretty good compared to other Korean grab and go places. The meal is made as you order, and BIG portion. For example, $5 for a \"small\" glass noodle, I mean it doesn't look small at all. The owner was friendly and she made sure first come first serve. I will definitely come back often!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some \"Home-cooked\" Korean food? You will be getting exactly what you ask for. Like the name suggests.  Food: What can I say, it's authentic Korean dishes. You got your Bibimbap, Pork Bone soup, Rice cakes, Tofu soup, basically all the typical dishes you find at any Korean joints but done well.  Note: For the price point, it's definitely worth!  Service: it's a family own joint and everyone is super friendly and humble.  Atmosphere: The place is quite small fair warning. However I would say that it's fairly confortable... I mean what do you really expect? It's a small joint with good food.  Recommendation? Dine in or out, it's definitely worth coming if you just aren't feeling like spending a lot."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after deciding that we didn't want Chinese food for once. And man was it a good idea!   I hardly give 5 stars due to the many factors involved in a rating process but they truly deserve it.   Starting with the customer service, it's family ran by a daughter and her father, very heartwarming seeing someone his age still trying to do what he can while his daughter is scrambling around doing 100 things at once. At no point in time had they not made us feel welcomed. It was extremely busy for such a small take out restaurant but she didn't seem to even break a sweat!   Food: We ordered the Beef Rice Bowl (because all of you rave about it) Gamjatang and a small Jap Chae. The beef rice bowl was packed with an assortment of many flavours that all went well together, the gamjatang was amazing one of the better ones in the area just a tad spicy to the taste and the jap chae I could say was the best I've ever had.   Price: the best part of all this amazing service and food? It only costed us about 23 dollars for all that food. I wish I found this spot earlier so I didn't have to had waste all that time and money at Owl and all those other below average Korean restaurants!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for some take out Korean food after reading the reviews from fellow Yelpers, and was pleasantly surprised at the portion that this restaurant gives to their customers. This is a family owner restaurant (almost like a corner-stop restaurant). The place itself is VERY small,  mainly recommended for take-out services.   Ordering the Beef Rice Bowl was a definite surprise for me - they towered the food in a Styrofoam bowl, and wrap the top with Saran wrap. It didn't look like much until digging in...it felt like it had like 3-4 servings packed generously in the bowl. The Beef Rice Bowl had a lot of different things packed in there, and the flavours all together is perfection. I've also tried the Korean fried chicken and their pork bowl soup, which were also delicious and filling.  The owner is very considerate of our experience with their food. Once I called early and arrived late to get their take out, he advised that we do not need to call too head of time as the quality of flavour decreases as the food gets colder. He said he wants everyone to experience the authenticity of his food at it's best - when the food is still hot. Would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Just bought a beef lunch box and a jap chae . So worth it and good ! Love the elderly gentleman who takes the bill . He's so cute and funny"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and homemade. Mainly is a takeout place but there's a table and table top for you to sit and eat on if you choose eat in. Very sweet and nice family that run the shop! Definitely stop by and try it out if you're around the area!"}
{"text":"I know this place when they were a bigger restaurant at Lesile and Finch many years ago. Their quality of food are the same or even better than before. You cant go wrong with their pork bone soup. They have the best in town. Friendly service and very affordable price make me visiting them continuously. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to pick up some food for my brother after studying. It was my first time here, I always saw it but never bothered to go inside. When I went in, I was greeted with multiple friendly hellos and smiles! The elderly male at the cash register was so friendly, he made me feel really welcome. Very nice service. :)   I ordered the gamjatang (pork bone soup) and waited around 5mins. Got to choose 3 appetizers from a huge selection. The portions are big!! The broth is delicious with the right amount of spice. The pork was tender and had a great flavour. It comes with seasoned rice and a whole potato. Overall, this place is great and I'm really glad I gave it a try. It's gonna be my new go to place for pork bone soup!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is mainly a take out place. Its small and consists only a few seats. So it isn't exactly \"comfortable\". Don't get me wrong. I love coming here for my side dishes. Quality is great. They're made fresh and flavorful. I usually get the different kinds of kimchi, seaweeds, and a box of japchae. As well, the owners give really really generous portions compared to many places out there. No doubt, I'll always keep coming back to this little cute family restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy cow, was I impressed! Hidden in a typical plaza, this little take out joint takes the gold across the board. The food, the price, and the lovely service left me speechlessly satisfied and just bubbly happy (may have been a little hangry starting the day).   We shared the meal between 2. We came in for the sweet spicy chicken (but sadly, one step too late and they were running a bit low). We ended up ordering the beef ribs rice bowl, the spicy rice cake, and an order of freshly made jap chae.   No regrets. The jap chae was easily one of the best flavored. Textures was on point, and simple. Unlike the vast majority, oilliness was not a problem. In fact, we felt pretty good after eating. The spicy rice cake was also very scrumptious. The rice cake was fresh, the sauce is more textured than the typical ones, with a wicked kick. Lacking eggs and fish cake but we didn't mind too much. The rice bowl was enormous and just a nice mix of colour, texture, and flavor; there was a variety of veggies, meats, noodle and rice. Though the kalbi lacked the grill characteristics, it was tender and well marinated.  I love the whole experience. The staff was friendly. You can really feel the love and dedication the family has to their restaurant. This is my new to go place!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight to get some takeout.  The place doesn't really lend itself to eating in, there's only 5 seats.  But you could eat in, if a spot is available.  I nearly broke my neck stepping into the place because my shoes were wet and they don't have a doormat or anything.  So beware when stepping onto the tiles, in winter.    We ordered 2 pork bone soups and a beef rice bowl.  I asked the gentleman what the difference was between the rice bowls and the Bi Bim Bap.  He just said different ingredients but wasn't any more specific.  I decided to give the rice bowl a whirl.  They put the pork bones and soup in seperate containers because they give you loads of pork bone.  Flavours were nice and  the soup is quite spicy, yummy.  The rice bowl was really interesting.  It's plain rice at the bottom, then there's a lot of stuff placed on top.  There's the glass noodle, beef(that we chose), romaine, 2 dumplings, dried tofu and seaweed strips.  Then they drizzle mayonnaise and hot pepper sauce on too.  It sounds and looks a mess but it was really delicious and I would definitely order it again.    The people working were both friendly and pleasant.  The food is lovely and good value for money.  The pork bone soup is only $6.95 and the beef rice bowl was $7.95.  Only bad part is the tight entrance and bad parking at this plaza.  I parked at a the Tim Hortons/ Wendys next door and walked over.  I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"3.5 for me  I got the pork and kimchi lunchbox take out. It was filled with a good variety of side dishes and some rice. There wasn't enough rice to accommodate the sides since they were pretty salty. Flavorful though. It also came with a soup (pork bone soup without the pork bones?) it was really really salty. I had to chug water after.   I would come back to try the other things, I actually went to this place a lot when they opened at Leslie and Finch, cool to see they are still alive and kicking."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for Korean food.   This place is family run and the food tastes home made in the best way possible.   They have lunch specials, dinner for two, and a la carte items.   We have been here twice and both times, we got combo number 1 ($20) which comes with pork bone soup, japchae, and rice cakes.   Everything is flavoured perfectly. The pork bone soup isn't overly salty or spicy, with a generous amount of potato and pork. The japchae comes with seafood and two dumplings and is the perfect amount of sweet and spicy, the japchae is pretty standard, but still good. The sweet and spicy chicken is delicious too. It's a must try!   Each dish comes with 3 side dishes that range from fish cakes, to kimchi, to eggplant. It kind of sucks that it's not unlimited like most Korean restaurants, but I get that they are family owned and have to think of what's best for their food costs."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering food from here. And I have to say I don't really have anything negative to say. I ordered take out both times here but, maybe I'll try sitting in next time if there's room available.   I bought bibimbap to keep it safe since it was my first time there. I love bibimbap as a basic for trying a new Korean place so why not, right? Honestly I was very happy with this meal. The portion size was so HUGE that I shouldn't have been able to finish it myself...but I pretty much did with maybe a little bit leftover. I would definitely put a lot of sauce on top because it tastes great. The owners are so cute and nice. I'm sure my experience was similar to others who've come by - you feel like you're being welcomed into a Korean home. Anyways after talking to them while I was waiting for my meal, they told me to come back and try the special bowls. She said it was more popular than the bibimbap AND cheaper! The honesty was very much appreciated, and I like how she didn't try to up-sell me but gave me advice on better value instead.   Today I brought my boyfriend back and ordered two beef bowls and a small sweet and spicy chicken. It was my boyfriends first time here and he was shocked with the portion size. The taste of the food was also delicious. I was not let down.   I'm so impressed with the food here mainly because I love adding to my list of food gems in the area."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. Since moving to Toronto three weeks ago I've eaten here 8 times. It's 100% authentic as well."}
{"text":"If you're looking for price to portion, selection, and taste then this is the place for ya homeboy. You ain't have to leave a korean restaurant and pay almost close to a $100 for just a couple of dishes. Perfect place for me."}
{"text":"This place was REALLY small and a little hard to find, but that is okay. Their food and price were the BEST for any Korean place ever. The people that ran the place are really nice and my friend and I ate in the restaurant so they even brought the dishes out to us. The price was great and we got their combo which came with bibimbap, sweet and sour chicken and these noodle along with 3 side dishes all for only $20. Like that could totally be the price of half of what we got at another place that wouldn't even taste as good. Would totally recommend this place to anyone near by and it's a great alternative to the pacific mall food court."}
{"text":"Reputation check: I came to try the beef on rice based on previous reviews and pictures, I ordered it to go and it came with 3 side dishes in small portions, the flavour of everything is great.  Where is the rest? The beef on rice didn't come as described by previous posts, it was beef on a bed of raw cabbage slices on top of rice. no seaweed, dumplings, fish cake. I was asked if I want fish cake, I said yes but I don't see any when I opened it at home.  How much cabbage and rice can you eat? For $9.95 I'd say it's below value without the additional extras that other diners had said they received.  The Omnipresent Gloved Hand: prepping food while wearing gloves is commendable, that is until you handle payment, in this case, my debit card and POS system without taking off your gloves; simple rule of thumb: gloves is for touching food ONLY"}
{"text":"This was amazing. I'm not very experienced with Korean but this was outstanding food! My husband and I came for a late lunch and had a combo for 2. Plenty of food and we are both big eaters. We got the bi bim bap, sweet Chicken and udon noodles. Will come here again next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Please come here. NOW.  This is honestly one of my FAVOURITE places to go for Korean food. Located in Scarborough, Silver Star plaza area, 100 Percent Korean gave me one of the most family-styled cooking experiences ever. Coming in, this place appears as if it were just for take out - there are only 4 bar seats, and a small table for 2 people on the side. There is also one chair for those to wait for takeout.  For a small place, there are still quite a lot of options for food. Also, you're able to see their entire kitchen and their process of creating the dishes for you. Whenever I visit, I like to get their combos and share it with someone because I think it has the best value for delicious food. The combo(s) I have ordered are the pork bone soup /chap chae /rice cake / rice for $19.95. In addition you get three additional side dishes with this. The quality of the food and the amount that you pay is completely worth it. In addition, you're supporting a small local business. The owners of 100 Percent Korean are lovely.  That being said, I've never had a chance to try their takeout, but if I do, I've seen the owner pack one of the rice bowls and it was super appealing!"}
{"text":"Amazing Korean food!!! Would definitely recommend!  There is limited seating in the restaurant so you can always take out."}
{"text":"Summary: big portions of tasty Korean dishes in family run small takeout spot with limited dine in space  Top Must-Get: beef rice bowl  100% Korean is tuckered right in-between the the No Frills plaza (Silverstar) and the Tim Hortons/Wendy (Midland). It's a little gem that serves BIG portions.  A lady and her dad run this small shop, which has one table (seats two) and a counter (seats up to four). They cook the food right in front of you, and offer a lot more than you'd expect from this size shop (and also get more traffic than I expected - case in point, they actually ran out of some of the sides we wanted!).  We had a beef rice bowl special and the tofu soup.  Both were served within 10 minutes, and came out as impressive portions. The latter (and all the soups) come with two extra sides.   They both tasted great and we'll definitely be back to try more! They have \"combos for 2\" which the customer after us got, and that looked like it offered amazing value!   The service is excellent; the elder man was very kind in explaining to me what meals came with sides, and the lady was apologetic that she ran out of options for sides for us.  Tip: you pay after you finish eating if you dine in, because - as they said - people always end up ordering more things as they eat!"}
{"text":"I just love it here. For less than $9 you can get pork bone soup, rice, 3 sides.   The owners are friendly and passionate about their shop, but best of all, the pork bone soup was so flavourful and SPICY that our taste buds danced."}
{"text":"Service was delightful and the English was good. I'm torn between being mindblown at how much food they gave me and disappointed because of the quality of their kalbi.  I got a beef short rib rice bowl ($7.95). They took out a large styrofoam bowl, the kind you see noodles in, usually, and filled the bottom with rice. Then, they topped it with raw cabbage, a heaping pile of sweet potato noodles, other assorted veggies and toppings, two pieces of deep fried/pan fried dumplings, and a number of pieces of kalbi. By the time they got to the kalbi, the lady making my bowl was trying to figure out how to stack more onto my bowl. She then covered it in some sort of sweet sauce, some sort of hot sauce, and mayo. I was concerned at how they would get a lid on it all. The solution, apparently, was not a lid. It was a large piece of cling wrap. While it worked, the food also started tipping out of the bowl as I was carrying it back to work.   The food was very tasty. Carby, but tasty. However, the kalbi didn't have much meat on it and what meat there was was quite chewy. Surprisingly so. Disappointingly so.  I'd come again, but next time, I won't be getting the kalbi."}
{"text":"Order beef rice bowl and pork belly rice bowl the taste is just good and the portion is very fulfilling. Good adventure!"}
{"text":"This tiny Korean spot is run by two very nice Koreans and I really enjoy visiting them rather than going to the franchised Korean restaurants. Their dishes are reasonably priced and they add more spice and flavour compared to other places which are more bland in my opinion. If you order take out, they give way more especially for the pork bone soup because rather than putting them in those circular containers with the soup, they separate them and give you a lot of meat in the big rectangular boxes! The place is very small so it's mainly good for individuals, couples, or take outs. They have a lot of side dishes to choose from and you are able to choose 3!"}
{"text":"Its an amazing place to carry out! Delicious food. I really recommend. Bimbab very tasteful."}
{"text":"Best pork bone soup in Toronto. LiMited seating so I usually order take out. Generous portion for pork bone soup and is only under $10. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered some takeout here on an quiet Friday evening and were super impressed with their food here.   100% Korean is a small and quaint takeout restaurant and probably serves up one of the best Korean food, let alone takeout, in an area devoid of good Korean food options. It's like a ray of sunshine! In addition, their prices are fairly cheap and their portion sizes are considerate.   We ordered the first combo with the tteokbokki rice cakes, japchae, gamjatang, rice, and three side dishes of your selection from a huge variety of them! All for $21, that's an amazing value.  All their food was fresh and excellent.  Everything was made right there, right in front of you while you wait. The japchae was nice and peppery, and was just the right amount of slingy. The pepper contrasted the sweetness extremely well and the same was found in their gamjatang which gave it an extra dimension. The tteokbokki was loaded! There was veggies, seafood, and even two fried mandoo dumplings there; it's not your everyday snack tteokbokki. Their dumplings were delicious, I would get an order of those next time for sure!  Those who can't take spicy beware, the food is indeed on the spicier side of things so perhaps you can ask for the food to be milder. The food also took some time to be prepared but then again, it was super fresh. Those who can't wait should call and order in advance."}
{"text":"I'm a regular for the porkbone soup and the combos with the 2 porkbone soups, japchae, and ricecakes! Best Korean food in Markham, hands down.   Comes with sides which are AMAZING. So much flavour in their vegetables.  I love the zucchini side the most (seaweed and beansprouts are a second)"}
{"text":"Feels like your mom's kitchen. The food is simply delicious . You can tell that the chef would never serve anything less than her standard. The rice bowls are excellent all flavors are perfect."}
{"text":"The gamjatang alone is worth dancing about. A small, simple, mom & pop shop serving mouth watering Korean dishes."}
{"text":"Expected much better given all the glowing reviews. I ordered two pork bone soups, and they were both equally bland and felt watered down. My taste buds can't even handle mild chicken wings so I did not expect myself to complain about the spices.  Granted, it was late (8pm) and I get they close down at 9, so they probably were running low on the soup I'm guessing? Still, I would rather they tell me to order something else than to water down both my soups. I've had lots of pork bone soups in Korea when I travel, as well as the places on Korea Town on Bloor. I would recommend sticking to Bloor street for your pork bone soup cravings.  Very very disappointed. I didn't give this a 1 because the Grandpa was great but the food just couldn't cut it."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Korean kitchen! Comfort food prepared and presented lovingly. Delicious. Will be back."}
{"text":"For what it lacks in decor and ambience, it makes up with food, it's simply delicious."}
{"text":"First time trying this joint and I am hooked! Got the $7.95 beef rice bowl which was a very generous (aka huge) and the special rice cakes (comes with seafood).   The rice bowl came with a layer of sticky rice, salad, beans sprouts, other Korean sides, jap chae, the beef and the nori. They used teriyaki sauce, mild hot sauce and a special white sauce with nori topped. The portion was amazing and food even better. I would definitely come back to support the small family owned business.  I recommend take out and coming early. We will be returning to try the spicy sweet fried chicken as it as sold out already . We went at 2:30pm on a Sunday and she hadn't prepared a new batch for the day. Apparently it sells like crazy - she said she made 20lbs worth Friday night for Saturday and they sold out. (She attributed this to her giving out large portions lol).   Definitely recommend this place! Such a gem."}
{"text":"This is a nice little joint ran by a nice family."}
{"text":"Amazingly good food here! Super friendly service as well!   The beef rice bowl ($7.95) here is so good! Based on the name you might think it's just a bowl of rice with beef on top but it's not! The bottom base layer is rice, followed by a layer of some lettuce and cucumber, then piled on is the japchae, and then the beef along with other toppings such as bean sprouts, fish cake slices, seaweed, and 2 dumplings. Lastly, it gets topped off with some sauces. Everything was flavorful and it came in a very generous portion.   There is limited seating here (about 6 seats).   Cash and debit only!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and quantity of food for the price, friendly service and great value overall."}
{"text":"More like 3.5. Friendly owners who are chefs, servers and cashier at the same time. We wanted to try their spicy pork bone soup but they sold out. It was only 5 something pm that day we went. Many were disappointed as well since they said it would be another 2.5 hours before the stock is ready.  We ended up getting their beef and vege bibimbap instead. They were all right. My vege friend said she liked their vege bibimbap more than others she had tried. They were supposed to come with 6 side dishes according to the menu but the old man owner only let us select 3 for some strange reasons. We were not too happy about it at all. We may come back if we are nearby again to sample other things to see if they will be better."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times in 2 weeks and if we lived closer, we'd be here every other night because the fam kept asking for it!!  They have 5 seats - 6 in a pinch so this place is best for takeout - eat in the car if you have to but just eat here!!  We've had fried dumplings (5 or 6 pieces for under $5),  Beef Rice Bowl which has at least 6 different banchan with hot sauce, some crema, rice, sweet potato noodles, and beef (which my companion ordered each time we were there), bibimbap  (small was more than filling for me and served as two meals for my buddy), gamjatang  (pork bone soup), fish soup, and chicken rice bowl.   The bill always comes to less than 45 for 4 with drinks and all of us are always so stuffed and happy when we leave.   The owners (father and daughter) are so sweet and very passionate about the food they serve. People kept coming in and out of the small shop to grab takeout. A definite must when in scarborough or markham - or heck - make the trek - SO worth it; just don't take my seat :p  100 percent korean, 100 percent amazing!"}
{"text":"I purchased a short rib lunch special for $9.95 which is great price for the variety of banchan and short rib you get.   This restaurant is literally hundred percent Korean owned. If you want authentic Korean food you must come here for really cheap prices  This restaurant is mostly for takeout. They have also meals for two or $20 which comes with a variety of different types of Korean foods.  As a lover of Korean of food think this is the best place to come for Korean food, especially in the Scarborough area where you don't have to drive really far and pay alot of money.  Another good thing about this restaurant is that you can buy banchanfor $2.99 a side dish.  You can also build your own paper box with the side dishes that they have.  Flavors are definitely authentic and I would definitely come back again to try all the other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here during off peak hours, and ordered a pork belly rice bowl. The rice bowl was built high, composed of rice, a lot of japchae/glass noodles, 2 gyozas, bean sprouts, fish cakes, chow mein pieces and just the right amount of gochujang. There were probably about 4 pieces of pork belly, and they were extremely fatty and slightly cold. It's kind of ironic. The food was served in one of those bibimbap stone bowls, but dish wasn't very warm. lol I've came here a few times prior, but food was piping hot!! Today was a little off? Perhaps it was the time of day I showed up. I'm still giving this place 4 stars from my previous visits here. However, I do recommend coming here during peak hours when food is hot hot hot! There might be a line up, but it's worth the wait. :D"}
{"text":"This place is so good and so worth it. The portions are huge! Definitely recommend the rice bowls :)"}
{"text":"Would highly recommend the ricecakes! So delicious and cheap ($5) and the portions are much larger in comparison to most places."}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb here, but after reading so many positive reviews to this place, I decided to check it out for myself and found it to be a safe haven for MSG, salt, and 30 minute waits for take out.  If that is your thing, by all means, come eat here where the Grandpa is an absolute sweetheart and the woman (who is doing all the cooking) is busting her arse.  And if you want to support a Mom/Pop business, then come here for some tasty, salty, long wait eats.  Only 4 spots to sit so, be warned and don't come here hungry.  OH, and if you get a lunch box, those apparently take the longest, so you'll definitely be waiting longer than \"normal\"."}
{"text":"The owners are super nice and accommodating. If you are eating in, you can pay after you finish your meal. This is a small place and most people would come here for take out. I ate in and there were only a few seats so it can get cramped but it is a pretty quick turn-around. The food is cooked fresh and on the spot. The Beef Rice Bowl is generously portioned with rice, glass noodles, beef, egg, deep fried gyozas, seaweed and assorted vegetables. There are additional flavors from the sauces and it is very well put together. They allow you to pick the sides since they have a variety available! The pork bone soup was flavorful and the spice level was on point. Overall, I would recommend coming here for take out (especially the rice bowls). The portions are great for their price point. This restaurant may be easy to miss since it is tucked in the small plaza next to Wendy's and Tim Horton's."}
{"text":"Very very very delicious home cooked Korean food made to order!! I love the rice cakes and their pork bone soup! They give you nice big portions and it's just such a nice humble couple owned business.   This place is mostly for take out though so don't really expect to sit in. They have literally five chairs, but I'm happy to pick food here any day!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp told me to go here so I listened. Ordered the Beef Rice Bowl and it is definitely a different take than other Korean restaurants fare of bulgogi or bibimbap. There is a lot going on in this bowl: pickled bean sprouts, seaweed flakes, fried rice noodles, Korean hot sauce, light and crisp gyoza, rice, sweet potato noodles, tender beef.  The different textures, colours and tastes definitely make this a very sensory dish...... So, even a multi-tasking self-diagnosed ADHD person (such as myself) can't manage anything other than watching the Korean news mindlessly while enjoying every scrumptious bite the spoon hands me.  Portions were hearty and huge and so definitely a value-conscious meal! Left with a fairly hefty sized styrofoam container for next day's lunch.  Owner remarked that nobody in the city makes the Korean ingredients like her and it is definitely a nice touch that she continues to make everything in-house."}
{"text":"Delicious small Korean restaurant. Seating is very limited so you can eat in but I would assume most people get takeout anyway. I ate in and the elderly man serving was very helpful! Very kind and sweet old man and what might be her daughter (?)  and the food was really good. I got the chicken meat only. My other friends got the chicken lunch box (which had a lot of variety!) and the mixed meat only. We all thoroughly enjoyed the food, price, and service! Ours was cooked on the spot and it honestly felt homemade. To me, that's a good thing. Highly recommend if you want some Korean food!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for lunch because of the Yelp review. And I gotta say that this place didn't disappoint me a bit. I like every single detail of my dining experience here.  First of all, the place is running by a small Korean family. The food is absolutely authentic, fresh, and comes with large quantity. We ended up getting Chicken on rice lunch special and Bi Bim Bap small.   The total came to $21 after tax. The service is welcoming and good. The chef is also the server, and they bring food to your table without expecting you to tip.   Food taste delicious at this spot. And the plus side is they are cheaper than most Korean restaurant in the area.   The only downside is that this place is so small, that they don't have actual dining table. You have to sit at the bar and it's not good for group of 4 and above. This place is designed for take-out, so it's reasonable the way it is."}
{"text":"We have been to this place twice and would always order the same things. this joint is a mom and pop type of place and it takes a while for them to cook your order.  Kalbi Dinner with 3 sides Pork Belly bowl  - massive and full of chap chae. its a hot mess but it tastes very good Rice cakes  PRO TIP: call ahead in advance so the food will be ready when you get there"}
{"text":"Met up with a couple of friends here. All of us love Korean food so we wanted to check it out. The place is not hard to find, but it is actually quite small, with only a few seats inside. 100% Korean is a take out place, so if you ever want a big bite on the go, this is where to go. The portions are very generous, and you'll be full by the time you finish! The food was rich and delightful. I had the small jap chae (glass noodles) and small spicy rice cake dish. Both were very good. I'd definitely go back if I'm super hungry. You'll need an appetite for sure!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner he was very hospitable, felt like eating at home. Be forewarned there is only a few seats so you might need to take out. You can maybe tell what they serve based on the name of the restaurant its 100 percent Korean!  Order the tofu soup which comes with rice and three sides. There soup can get a bit spicy especially by the time you get to the bottom of the bowl. It's got a very homey feel. I have also order take out before tried the pork bone soup and bibimbap they were both very good. My friend got the rice bowl looked really good too. For drink got the watermelon soda it's interesting very interesting.  Very good value for very good food."}
{"text":"100 Percent Korean is a tiny little shop that mostly only does Take-Out, but you can sit in on one the 5 seats available if you wish. Otherwise the whole place is pretty much just their kitchen, you can see the older gentleman cooking hard 2m away. They have a variety of side dishes you can choose from.  Ordered a pork bone soup and a beef special bowl. Both came VERY generously portioned. If you're here with just one other person, I'd strongly recommend getting only one main and share that with some sides instead. The pork bone soup was a little spicier than other places, and the bones were very meaty. The Special Bowl (you can choose between other meats) is rice topped with jap chae (glass noodles), bean sprouts, lettuce, seaweed, two dumplings and the meat choice, with some sauce drizzled on top. It is a very large bowl and I found it very tasty.  The two meals together came up to $18, very cheap for the amount of food. Will definitely return some time when I'm feeling hungry."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews by fellow Yelpers, I decided that I just had to try this place. I was not disappointed. I had the spicy pork belly with rice and it came with a choice of three sides. I chose bean sprouts, mushrooms, and kimchi. Everything was delicious!  It's a tiny place with a counter along the windows and seating for only six people. The owners(?) (father and daughter?) were very friendly and welcoming. I mentioned that I discovered them through the rave reviews on Yelp and they were very modest at accepting any praise.  I'll be back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"A busy take out restaurant in a quieter plaza beside Tim Hortons. The whole operation is run by only two people. They rush back and forth taking orders, cooking meat on the stove, mixing all the side dishes, cracking eggs, and ringing people up.  We came on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and they were just finishing a rush of orders. Wait patiently. The moment the cook is finished with her last order, she will look up and get your order. I had the big rice bowl with pork belly. Big is correct as the portions is huge and piled high. They don't even bother with a lid, just saran wrap it to keep everything in place. The big bowl comes with white short grain rice, cabbage, lettuce, yellow bean sprouts, little pieces of cut up sausages, japchae (glass noodles), yellow crispy noodles, seaweed, green onion and your protein of choice. Just in case that isn't enough, they stick two deep fried korean dumplings on the side for you.  The portion was so large that I had half of it for lunch the next day.   My partner had the beef lunchbox and the assortment of items looked delightful. He really liked the beef because it was all meat (hardly any fat) and well marinated."}
{"text":"Personally, I think mom and pop restaurants like 100 Percent are the way to go if you want authenticity and quality. The Koream owners here pay attention to every detail to ensure that the food is enjoyable. They even put their naenmyeon in a bowl that's completely made of ice (and including a slice of watermelon in the soup) for it to stay cool and delicious. I highly recommend this place and will be returning here to dine often."}
{"text":"Nice Korean takeout place. Owners are really nice. Food is great and large portions. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I went here one weekend while I was in the area. It's basically a little gem hidden in front of pacific mall ran by a family. Their prices are super reasonable for the amount given to you!   Inside sitting is very difficult, so if you wanna enjoy comfort korean food, I suggest bringing it home to avoid the door from constantly opens beside you.  The family had great customer service and provided our food ASAP. Our ride home was about 30-45 minutes and still hot when we ate it. The only item we cooked was the bimbampbop since we loved it crispy.  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for korean comfort food!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmarks for a while now and today, I finally got a chance to give this place a try.   The food here was delicious, and cheap. I ordered the pork bone soup ($6.95) and gave the beef rice bowl ($7.95) a try. Both were great! The portions were good and for the pork bone soup, you get a choice of 3 banchan (sides). I highly recommend the beef rice bowl. While the pork bone soup was good, the beef rice bowl was better! It came with a base layer of rice, then a layer of veggies, and then it is topped with a generous heaping of japchae and beef! They also added other various toppings such as dumplings, bean sprouts, and slices of fish cake. To be honest, I feel the beef rice bowl can be split between two people. It is a large portion.   This place is mainly for take out. There is seating available, but it is limited.   It is a small run family business and I love supporting businesses like this. They were also extremely friendly. I would definitely come back and try their other items!   p.s. they only accept cash and debit!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I loved it when they had a restaurant at Leslie and Finch and I was so happy when they opened up again.  The food is always tasty and the owners are really  nice. I would definitely recommend this to my friends!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews I had seen on yelp and this little place is a gem!  It is a very small place that caters more for takeout as it can seat 5 people at most. We ordered a beef rice bowl and a pork belly rice bowl which cost about $20.25 in total after tax ($8.95 before tax for each bowl). Both portions were huge and the owners were very generous with the ingredients. They gave a lot of meat as well and the overall presentation of the bowl resembles that of a mountain lol Each bowl consisted of rice, glass noodles, your choice of meat, sliced cucumbers, two pieces of dumplings, and some seaweed/dry noodles for garnish along with different sauces. The food tasted fresh and each bite was very flavourful! The owners were extremely friendly and in particular, I really loved the older gentlemen that took our order. He was super friendly and was very talkative. I will definitely come back and try out the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'll probably be coming back here whenever I'm craving Korean food. This is definitely a takeout place and there's maybe five stools to sit down on. The restaurant faces Steeles and you can see the sign from the road - it's in a small plaza wedged between the big RBC/No Frills plaza and Wendy's/Tim Hortons so be careful not to miss it. That being said if you do eat in, the owners will give you actual cutlery and plates. The owners are quite friendly and service is good.  Upon first glance the pricing for their food seems average. When you get your food and realize how big the portions are, you realize that you got a pretty good deal.   The menu consists of set dinners for two, recommended dishes, rice bowls, and sides (e.g. ddeokbokki/rice cakes, japchae, etc.) We ordered the set dinner for two - came to 22 dollars including tax and even with the both of us we still had half our meal left over. We wanted the pork bone soup but they were still in the process of making it as they had sold out earlier and substituted it with a box of beef on rice instead. Normally, the set comes with pork bone soup, a big box ddeokbokki (with seafood!) and a takeout box of all japchae.   It all comes with three side dishes which you can pick from at least 12 different options. They don't give a lot but the portion of the meal itself makes up for it.  Food was quite good. Especially the japchae - a good balance of sweet and slightly savory and a good texture. Beef on rice was good as well - beef was on the tougher side but not difficult to eat and was sweet. The rice cakes were also quite good and nicely presented. They could have easily given us a small box of rice cakes and sauce but they had half a boiled egg and seafood, garnished with sesame. You can see they put work into it. Later the owner gave us some of the pork bone soup to try. Lots of different flavors in it and quite spicy.   Good service, portions, and pricing and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a small restaurant with only three high chairs and a table for two.  You have to come at a non-busy time in order to get seats.  It's definitely great for take-out.  Great customer service as well-the gentleman was prompt and attentive.   I ordered the gamjatang.  The pork falls off the bone easily and tasted delicious!  The broth was sweet-spicy which I also enjoyed.  My meal came with three side dishes.  They have a huge selection of side dishes you can choose from.  I ended up getting the japchae, beans and fish tofu.  This only cost $6.95 - great bang for your buck with quality food!  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean spots, they have reasonable prices and are not stingy with their portions. Very cute father and daughter business, always serve you with a smile. The food is so good and will last you at least two meals."}
{"text":"I ordered jajangmyeon and beef rice bowl. I saw the old man microwaving my jajangmyeon sauce using a plastic tofu container. The beef bowl was a little too oily for my liking."}
{"text":"As dingy as this place was, this was good run down, plain good street quality Korean food.  When you go in, don't expect anything fancy.  In fact, I was given a dirty water cup to drink water from mid-way through my meal (more on that later).   We ordered a meal for 2 (~$25) and it had kam ja tang, jap chae, and something else which escaped my mind.  There were also side dishes.  Now, I'm not Korean so I don't know how to name these side dishes in Korean and the man who was serving the side dishes to me was so annoyed that I didn't know the names.  He corrected me once, and was noticably irritated that I didn't know the name.    Midway through my meal, I had choked on some hot pepper sauce and my throat was burning so I was coughing and coughing.  My bf went to try to get me a glass of water and the man was reluctant to even get me water without selling me a bottle.  My bf asked if he could have tap water and he gave us a DIRTY PLASTIC CUP.  There were literally dirt fragments in my glass of water.    Seating in the restaurant is very uncomfortable as they are worn down bar chairs that are a bit unstable.  I would suggest solely taking out food (which apparently most people knew better because they were all ordering take out).  Overall, the food is not bad at all but honestly, the attitude of that guy (again grumpy old man syndrome - see Cho Sun Ok review) and the dirty cup of water made me deduct a few stars because I value service greatly."}
{"text":"A family owned restaurant in the corner of the plaza behind timmy. The grandpa there is soo nice and with his old age he still works pretty fast. It's the daughter that's cooks and the grandpa helps her. Sometimes it can take a while as they're only a team of 2/3. The food is very reasonably priced and very delicious. Only minus is that there is very limited seating and wait can sometimes take long. Definitely my go to place for Korean now"}
{"text":"Cute little takeout joint run by a nice elderly Korean couple! Service is always friendly :)  Beef rice bowl  - Kind of a mish mash of stuff: lettuce, rice, japchae, mandu, beef, and a mixture of sauces. It's messy and probably not the best looking dish... but it's surprisingly tasty!"}
{"text":"We had beef woth rice with a side I had seaweed and Kim chi iy was really delicious with lettuce. The owners are really nice and one if them.is over 80 years old and he is still working that really inspires me. It's is not one of the best Korean old i tasted but it is very tasty. I hope this place opens for a very long time"}
{"text":"We ordered the 'special combo for 2' for eat in for $20.99.  We ordered combo 2.  Luckily there was still 2 seats remaining. There are only 4 seats for eat in. The portion was good and there was lots of sides to choose from. The combo includes 3 sides.   Be prepare that there is going to be a little bit of a wait since they get very busy with take out orders. Everything is freshly cooked and prepared.  One of the staff is an elderly gentleman, the main staff (chief) is the middle age lady. Definitely will come back to try the soups with rice next time. It looks really good. This is such a good tasting local Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great value,  HUGE portions. Not the most authentic Korean,  but it's delicious even with a western twist.  The rice bowls are GiANT"}
{"text":"I stumbled here 5 days ago and I've been back every day food is great owners are great people,  they really care about the quality of service and food.   Something about this place that brings nice people together maybe it's the owners positive attitude.   Seating is limited and in the 5 days I've been here every customer has offered to rearrange their seats so others can sit.  Priced well,  amazing food,  great owners and nice group of customers   7/5 stars if it was possible"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars* Decent takeout Korean food run by family. Prices are the more or less the same as those in sit down restaurants, as were portions. Did not feel it was five star worthy, but it was good. It took a long time for us to actually get our food.... we got take out because we were too hungry to cook, but we waited around 20-30 minutes for everything..."}
{"text":"The food here is hearty, flavourful, and cheap. We got the pork one soup ($7) and the two-person special ($20), and everything was flavourful and home cooked. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean takeaway restaurant in the area. It has these interesting specialty rice bowls that they load with side dishes and a meat (e.g. bulgogi, BBQ pork belly, spicy chicken) and cover with nori, japchae, some fried mandoo, and mayo. That dish definitely doesn't feel like traditional Korean fare, but they got you covered in that department too! In fact, their gamjatang even sells out daily. I missed it twice now... Geez. I am also waiting for a chance to try their cold noodles.   The owners are a Korean woman and an old adorable Korean man! Their service is spot on and the food is hot, hearty, and homestyle. You can't go wrong. Come here."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while and finally stopped in.  The couple (father and daughter I believe) working here are really nice and I really felt like I was at a Korean family's house to be honest.  Got to try the Bibimbap (small) as the lady warned me that the large is too big for one.  Normally I would take this as a challenge but I had to eat dinner in just 1 hour so went for the small which was $8.95 plus tax.    The portion is really big with a wonderful combo of minced meat, veggies, tofu, etc all topped with a fried egg.  Along with the main you get a choice of 3 sides (banchan) which really makes this a great deal.  They were also sweet enough to offer a taste of their pork bone soup which was really good!  Kinda feels like a relative giving me more food to eat:) Did I already say that I felt like I was at a Korean family's home??  Seriously though, I love, love to support family businesses and this is without doubt a great family to support.  The place is really small and there is seating for only 4-6 so is designed more for take out.  How Korean is 100% Korean?  I would say 110%!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food made by good people. Just like others have mentioned, the place is small so you might not be able to eat here. Takeout should work out fine for you. The food is definitely on point, but when I was there, it was only father and daughter. We tried a handful of dishes here and they were delicious, and enough to cover me for Korean Thanksgiving. But if you're going with a gang, it'd be good to have things to do while you wait for your eats."}
{"text":"I scrolled through a good amount of reviews while waiting for my food, and it seems like only one user named Ali M. noticed it too - the people who work here don't use gloves, at an open kitchen with the cashier machines right in front, and the door facing all the food. I would understand if chefs use their bare hands in an enclosed, sanitized kitchen, but this was just disgusting. The guy working here had 1 glove on one of his hands and didnt use that hand. LOL. The lady sneezed, while facing the stove..so wasn't sure if my short ribs were contaminated - couldnt see if she covered her face since she was facing away from me.  I couldn't really decide what to order since the menu was fairly large for a korean takeout place. The two people that work here suggested us to get the lunch box. I asked what comes with the short ribs lunch box and the lady said \"you won't be disappointed\" with a very impatient tone. Well it would be really nice to know what is inside since there a lot of things I don't like in the Korean cuisine - almost anything that is pickled (which is most of their sides).  Food took a while to come but I was fine with it since they cooked the meat on the spot (instead of some pre cooked stuff).  Onto the actual food, it was honestly hard for me to eat, knowing how they touched my food and potentially touching their face, a dirty bag, an unclean table, the cash machine, the fridge door....... The short ribs were tough, I didnt touch any of the pickled stuff, the glass noodles were decent, the soup was meh.  For $12, Id rather go to an actual restaurant and have my food served to my table with actual service and hygeine."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after my good friends discovered it randomly one night, and I have to say they found a really nice Korean spot out of the yonge/finch & bloor/christie areas! The place is a family run business, usually operated by an elderly male and a middle aged woman with a small kitchen space directly behind them. The couple are always very welcoming to anyone who comes into the restaurant.  Seating space is very limited in the restaurant however, as most customers who seem to come usually grab their food and go. There are a few seats available but I'd advise against eating in unless you're coming in with one or two other people.   Prices are very fair and the portions are massive. The food is cooked to order and even then it doesn't take long for them to prepare it for you. If you're sitting in, you pay after you finish eating like you're at a restaurant, and the fridge seems to always be stocked with cold drinks. Pretty sure I even had grape Crush one night...  Overall I'll be back every so often when I'm craving for Korean food and I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  I had heard about this place, and we decided to give it a go.  It just goes to prove, once again, that non-fancy does not mean mediocre.  This is the kind of food you find in Seoul at smaller take-out places.  They are reputable and have regulars here, many Koreans taking out food.  The panchan is extensive and you can choose 3, to go with your entree.  My favourite p'pa kimchi and kosari namul!!!  The Ajonim is a sweet man and runs this place with his daughter.  I had the dwenchang chigae ... yummmm lots of clams and good tobu.  Spouse had sundubu chigae very authentic.  Love this place ... nice owners and good food reasonably priced.  Lots of veggie options if you are so inclined.  They make their own baechu kimchi in house.  Go there you will love this place.  Modest/humble and GOOD!  Tt'o manayo!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service! One of the few authentic Korean places in north Scarborough. The owners are very kind and provided great service. Seating is pretty limited, but they do take out!"}
{"text":"Plan to take your food out because the place is very small.  The food was really good, we got the special set 1 for two people (~$23 with tax) and we were so full. She made the fried rice cake on the spot! The family duo were very friendly to us.    Took off a star because I saw they had a bucket of meat sitting on the floor rather than a counter top."}
{"text":"Nice honest people business. They answered my questions clearly and even told me one of the dish they did not have at the time doesn't look like the photo they show. I really value and highlight this. The food were good, and with the price, I think this is a good shop for Korean food, yummy, for taking out. Very small sitting for dining in, and honestly I don't recommend sitting there and enjoy food, which I did. There were one lady and an old man. I love the chapchae, ordered a small one, and the lady was nice enough to tell me that it is a lot and put in the box for me despite the fact that I ordered for here, after having the beef bowl. She was right. The old man was nice, trying to communicate with me, but I could not get what he said, so I just smiled and nodded. He looked surprised when I gave him tips though, and it is only around 15%. I can understand since the area, the people usually come in would not give tips or very small amount. Quick affordable Korean food. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for people who like Korean food!  I've been here twice so far and it's some of the best Korean food I've had in a while. It's really cheap and so delicious. The place is really cute and small, there is only a few seats so if you want to eat in you can, but it's unlikely you'll find a seat, there is one table with a couple chairs and a long bar-like table with high chairs that fit around five people. Usually people get take out here, the owner is really nice and there is a cute old man who cooks here - they're both super nice and friendly!  I had a few of the dishes here, including the Pork bone soup / rice cake / Chap Chae / Rice combo. I love the pork bone soup, the pork is super tender and the soup is really delicious and perfectly spiced, everything else here is also really good. I've also tried the Bibimbap / Jajang U dong noodle and spicy sweet chicken combo, which is also really really good. Not only is the food cheap for what you get, but it's also really filling."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very kind and funny older couple who presumably run the place. We ordered the chicken rice bowl, small regular rice cakes, and bean sprout and seaweed sides. The chicken rice bowl was delicious. It had nicely-marinated chicken, rice, glass noodles, shredded potatoes, 2 dumplings. The dumplings were pretty bad, but they were just an addition to the rice bowl. We got the regular rice cakes. They also offer \"special rice cakes\" which are apparently higher quality rice cakes mixed with seafood. The rice cakes are the long cylindrical kind as opposed to the sliced ovals. They were good, but the only concern was that as soon as the rice cake sauce started to boil, it was poured into a styrofoam container... I'm not sure how healthy that is. The bean sprouts were pretty salty. They also don't accept credit cards. Despite all of that, I would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Loved the personality of the people there. We ordered the Special Combo #1 for 2 (19.95). It came with pork bone soup, bowl of rice, glass noodles, 3 side dishes and chap chae with some shrimp, clams, rice cakes and dumplings.   Food was great! Definitely a must try. Although we wish there was a second bowl rice. The space is way too small to dine-in!! Do NOT dine in, it does get uncomfortable. Next time we'll definitely come back but for take-out."}
{"text":"The owner used to own a restaurant near finch and Leslie many years ago. So glad we found him again! Amazing hearty korean food"}
{"text":"Love this place! came here a couple of times for their pork bone soup and it is amazing! You also get 3 side dishes which all were tasty, I recommend getting those tofu cubes!  The price is really cheap compared to other locations and the portion was huge, it was only like 8 dollars in total . I love how the soup is normally spicy and you don't need to add any spices like other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"We visited this hole-in-the-wall Korean joint for a lunch takeout. The restaurant is tiny - just a kitchen and a few chairs. It was cool to be able to watch the two employees there cook the food while we waited.  We ordered the bibimbap, the beef on rice, and the dumplings. All of them were very good. The bibimbap was large and had a lot of variety. The beef on rice was simple but well done. The dumplings unfortunately don't hold up quite as well over time (we ate everything about 45 minutes after picking it up), but they were still good. The entrees also came with banchan. I felt the banchan serving sizes weren't very generous, but it was at least nice to have some sides.  Overall, it was a fun stop and the food was tasty. Check it out for a nice takeout meal."}
{"text":"The first time we came by this place it was New Year and they were close . So we went elsewhere. We came here expecting a restaurant . We were wrong . It's a small place with a cafeteria counter of sorts . Greeted by a very welcoming grandpa . He said to take a seat if there are any available ,  who by the way speaks very good English and has a good sense of humour ( that's something )  . They were definitely hoping for a take out business as there are only 5-6 seats .  The rest of the space was prep, kitchen and storage . Just about everything you order on the menu was prepared fresh so there will be a bit of wait. So wait we did , the wait is worth it though . As the name suggested the dishes were 100% Korean in taste .  We had the beef rice bowl as was recommended by most and after tasting it we understood why. Albeit a bit small we had opted to stay and eat in. The dish was served in a clay bowl from direct heat. you can actually hear sizzles and popping . Beefbowl was not what I'd expected . It's made of rice at the bottom , Jap Chae , vegetables , 2pcs wonton , stir fried beef , fish cakes, sauce fried rice noodles and seaweed nori (whew) in one bite it makes a good perfect bite . The portion was quite large fed 2 hungries quite well all for $7.95 . We paid for the bill on our way out , thinking it was self service I was carrying my empty tray out but Grandpa stopped me and I will quote him \"Put it down , that's my Job\" . This place may be tiny but service clearly is top notched ! Very hospitable and quick on his feet you can tell from actions he has some good stories to tell . I think he brings the charm to the business .   The only down side I feel from my experience is because of two who seemed to be hired part time help students . They didn't know what they seem to be doing . From the looks of it they were more a hindrance than a help to the daughter who runs the small kitchen . Because it was a tiny and open place you can see everything during prep and my head cringes every time either of them slows down the process . the two need to be taught a thing or two about sanitation, food presentation   Alas , I now itch to try their other dishes Would want to try the other dishes ."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located on Midland Ave and Steeles Ave E in the plaza next to Wendy's and Tim Horton's. Look out for the blue sign with white font. There are a few parking spots in front of this place, but it does fill up pretty quickly around lunch & dinner time.   [SERVICE] - 4/5 The owners are very nice. They might get stressed out during peak hours but that's because on most days, it is a two-person operation!   [DÉCOR] - 4/5  Very small, ideal for takeout. There were only a couple seats, and you can definitely eat here when there aren't too many people ordering/waiting for their food.   [QUALITY] - 5/5 Tastes homemade and fresh. They always pile the ingredients on the rice bowls and form delicious mountains of food!   [ORDER] - 5/5 Beef Rice Bowl - $9.95: a wonderful medley of rice, japchae (glass noodles), marinated beef, fried egg, fresh bean sprout, deep fried korean dumplings, seaweed, and Korean cabbage. The spicy sauce & mayonnaise also goes very well with all the ingredients.   [OVERALL] - 5/5  I would definitely recommend this place for homemade Korean food. The portions are HUGE and you can probably share a beef rice bowl between two people. If you have a big appetite, the rice bowl will definitely satisfy your hunger!"}
{"text":"A friendly, family owned business. The owners are Korean so there is legit Korean food here. They are very friendly so if you are not familiar with Korean cuisine do not be afraid to ask them. Also, bear in mind this place is not some upscale Korean restaurant so do not come here with expectations of fancy Korean delicacies/food in your head. Instead, think homey, Korean food in front of the TV on a lazy night.  This location is easily accessible by public transportation since they are literally on Steeles. There is also parking available, but imo the parking lot is not that big and can get pretty busy (the plaza is full of restaurants).  The place is small since they're mainly for takeouts, but there are some window seats available. They have a pretty good-sized menu, with various combos to single food items. They also have a vast variety of side dishes if you're into those like I am. The food is budget-friendly, so if you are single and don't want to cook and craving a Korean bite, this would be the perfect place for you."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of experience with Korean food, but good food is good food!  Good sized portions, very friendly and helpful mom & pop restro. Felt like being at invited to a friends place for dinner.  Ordered the #1. Pork bone soup / rice cake / chap chae / rice and the #2. Bibimbap / Jajang udon noodle / Spicy sweet chicken \"special combos for 2\"  Everything incredibly delicious to me!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Beef Rice Bowl Special ($7.95) This beef rice bowl was huge! A big bowl of rice, topped with japchae (Korean glass noodles), veggies, and topped with beef. I personally really like japchae so I was excited that it was in this rice bowl. The beef was flavorful, and love the spicy sauce drizzled on top. Really tasty, a must try if you come! Only thing that I didn't like was the beef meat was hot, but the japchae and veggies were cold, and the rice was warm - didn't really like how there were mixed temperature in the food I was eating. Amazing for its price considering portions were generous. Another good thing to point out is it's the same price for any choice of meat - knowing that, next time I'm going to go for the more expensive meat options like kalbi.  Bibimbap ($8.95) Rice mixed with 6 different ingredients - one being meat, and rest were a mix of marinated vegetables topped with a fried egg. I never understand why bibimbaps are more expensive compared to other Korean dishes which have more meat. This dish was ok, but nothing special. I didn't like how their bowl was not in the sizzling kind of bowl, at least it wasn't sizzling when served. Would totally recommend trying their rice bowl specials instead.  Perfect take-out spot for lunch! Will be back to try their other items."}
{"text":"While small and humble, 100 percent Korean is a homely, charming, and true hole-in-the-wall restaurant. It's as if you've stepped through the door for the first time after being away from home for so long, and you find mom cooking just like the old days.  I was never a big fan of Korean food, but my two experiences here have left me feeling more than satisfied. While there is a little bit of seating area, we always opt for take out to eat in the comfort of our own home.  The price and quality of this place can't be beaten. Some of the better Korean spots usually charge a premium for their food, but here you get a cheaper price, better quality, and more food than you can handle. Best pork bone soup in my opinion. The broth is flavourful, there's lots of meat, and there's a nice spice kick to it.   The owner is so sweet, so charming, and comments on everything just like a loving grandfather would. And you can taste it in the food! Everything is delicious and carefully prepared.   Just like when your parents cook for you, you'll leave happy, hearty, and full."}
{"text":"Cutest place ! Love the food here, love the old grandpa at the cash and the auntie that makes all the food! Everything taste amazing and it's one of my go to places for Korean food!   The seating is very limited here though so I usually get things for take out, my favourites here would be be pork bone soup and kalbi rice bowl. The pork bone soup is very very flavourful - you can tell that it's been boiling on the stove for at least a good half a day so the broth is very savoury. The portion of it is definitely very very generous (3 to 4 giant pieces of pork), and comes with 3 small side dishes and a bowl of rice. The price you may ask? Less than 10 dollars tax included ! How to beat that.   And if you are not feeling brothy or boney, try the kalbi. The auntie knows how to make kalbi. The flavour is perfectly marinated into the meat and upon every bite you feel the marinate opening up all of your taste buds.   Always a great food experience at this shop!"}
{"text":"I've ordered a gamjatang and spicy rice cakes to go. The food was delicious, the price was great, and the service was excellent. They offer limited seats for dine-in, and they specialize in take-out. The place is clean, and the atmosphere itself feels warm and welcoming. I would recommend people coming here to try out their food."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I found this place through Yelp and came in with high expectations due to their high rating and glowing reviews. Despite that, my expectations were still surpassed. It's a small location that had only one person cooking, one person taking orders, and one person prepping ingredients when I walked in. Although they do have a small eating counter, this place caters primarily to the take-out crowd. Their menu is pretty straightforward, with almost no description of what the Korean-named dishes are, so make sure you do your research before hand if you're not familiar with them.   I ordered 2 of the 2-people meals for takeout dinner: Pork Bone Soup/Rice Cakes/Japchae and Beef on Rice/Dumplings/Kimchi Soup. There's a salad bar that contains the side dishes (Banchan) that you're allowed to choose from to compliment your meal. The food itself was quite delicious. The spicy food (Pork Bone, Kimchi Soup, Rice Cakes) had a nice heat to it without being overly spicy. The dumplings were nice and crispy without being overly deep fried. The Beef on Rice and Japchae were well put together and tasty. Restaurant quality for sure, but with that home cooked love included. I would recommend calling ahead with your order as they got quite busy while I was waiting for my food. Can't wait to order from them again!"}
{"text":"A cute little mom and pop shop - and I'm not joking when I say little. The restaurant seats about 5 people max and is more of a takeout joint. The owners of the store are super nice and friendly and you can tell that they put their heart into their work.   The food is fairly priced, ranging from $3-$13. We got the jajang udon and the spicy pork belly. I've only ever had jajangmyun before, so jajang udon was a nice little change and was good, just a bit on the salty side. The spicy pork belly was really good, with enough spice to creep up on you throughout the meal, but not enough to kill you outright. Each meal came with three side dishes (banchan) that you could choose from the display.  Would definitely come back again, but for takeout instead."}
{"text":"100% Korean a new takeout place in Scarborough.  100% Korean does sounds familiar? http://www.yelp.ca/biz/100-korean-restaurant-toronto This restaurant used to locate at the Chinese Plaza at Leslie and Finch. This new location is opened by the daughter that used to own the North York restaurant.  The menu here though is a lot simpler. A noodle, a rice bowl and maybe some snacks? They do have a lunch bento box offers.  Spicy Sweet Chicken Snack Size ($3.99) was meh. The batter was heavy and soggy and sad thing it was not cooked when ordered so it was warm and sad.  Spicy Chewy Noodle ($6.99) was quite refreshing and I love the chewiness of the noodle. Great cold noodle dish during hot summer days.  Room for improvement but promising for a small neighbourhood Korean takeout.  Grand Opening 15% off Special."}
{"text":"I love this place. My go to is usually the beef rice bowl or the short rib rice bowl. Everything on the menu is pretty good. Very authentic korea food."}
{"text":"Great korean food!!! The place is run by a father and daughter team and they were both extremely friendly. We had the spicy chewy noodle and the special chicken rice bowl, along with two drinks and our total came to under $20. The place also has a wide array of korean apps to chose from and were all delicious. Over i would really recommend this place but the seating is very limited so take out would probably be the option.  Oh! They have have a special lunch menu :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the large chap chae.  Very flavorful but just a little salty. Was going to give 4 stars but -1 star after seeing Alice review. I hope he didn't use his hands to touch the chap chae."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  It was good home made quality, so it tasted good yet lack the refinement of restaurant quality.  It had its charm.  The price tag was not low, but it came with lot of food.  The home made kimchi were sub par.  The chilli sauce was outstanding.  The Grandpa gave the friendliest service."}
{"text":"Good price, friendly staff. I ordered the pork bone soup and beef rice bowl. Size portions are good for the price. Warm staff. Ingredients fresh. Tastes like home.  The beef rice bowl has nicely flavoured and cooked beef. Excellent presentation. Very generous portion of meat to carb ratio. Surprised to see it came with 3 nicely deep fried dumplongs. There was japchae in the bowl too. Nice flavour. Good texture of crunch, chewiness, softness Filling. And price. 9/10.  Pork bone soup. Nice. Lots of pork meat. Excellent choice of side dishes. Soup is flavourful. You can taste the strong pork bone, has more msg in the soup than I would like, but it compliments the already strong broth. 8/10  To be even better may I recommend better food handling during food prep. Ie sometimes no gloves when grabbing food. However the restaurant has a clean environment already."}
{"text":"It's definitely yummy and super wallet friendly! I love the convenience of it and they made my soondubu right in front of me! The soondubu had clams and shrimp in it which normally isn't served in it (at least to the restaurants I've been too) so its definitely a bang for your buck! I'll especially come back because of the service. The old man had the biggest smile on his face and greeted me so warmly which I normally don't get and this is well appreciated. 4 stars for now until I try some more food!"}
{"text":"I walk into the seemingly empty store. It's cozy. They have a cafeteria style array of side dishes, and there's a dimly lit kitchen tucked at the back of the skinny room. To my left I am unexpected greeted by an old married couple enjoying their afternoon rice with side dishes.   \"WELCOME TO OUR STORE!\" the man says with enthusiasm.   This was the man accompanied by his wife, the owners of 100 percent korean - my (newly claimed) all-time favourite korean restaurant.  You have to order from the special combo for two menu. It's only ~$20 and it can actually feed three people full and four people fair. Price-wise, this restaurant is definitely wallet-friendly.   Here's what I've tried so far:  Pork Bone Soup - pork bone portions are really generous. The broth is well-made. Tastes fresh and good.  Seafood Rice Cakes - something about the sauce is really unique but extremely tasty. The dish comes with a bunch of different seafood (ie. scallops, mussels, squid, etc.). Rice cakes are tender and easy on the teeth.  Zhajia Noodles - pretty standard. Only problem with this dish is that they used udon noodles, which did not go well with the saltiness of the marinade.  Bibimbap - weird but good. It's a rather unconventional spin on the bibimbap. Usually you have bulgogi with zucchini, egg, and other simple korean vegetables. But for 100 percent korean's version, they literally but a rainbow in a pot and cook it. There's egg plant, pink radish, yellow radish, carrots, spinach, bean sprouts. Good ratio of toppings to rice. Recommend adding more sauce than usual since the steamed vegetables by nature are kind of bland.  Cold Glass Noodles - the best glass noodles I've ever had. They cook and season the noodles really well. Usually this dish tastes really bland to me, but I thoroughly enjoyed the glass noodles served here.  Sweet Chicken - it's like sweet and sour chicken but better. There's a home-made taste to it. They don't go overkill on oil unlike many asian type spins on chicken.  I'm being pretty critical with the dishes they served but believe me, it was 100 Percent worth.  Thanks 100 Percent Korean!"}
{"text":"Nice little take out food spot. Space for maybe 3-4 people to eat in there. Food is good and affordable. The spicy rice cakes are my favourite."}
{"text":"Tried this place the very first time and I enjoyed every last bite. Had their beef rice bowl special and the portion was generous and very delicious. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was because the dumplings was a bit on the cold side but other than that it was good.  Side note: The owners were very friendly and nice.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends had the Large Bibimbap, Beef Rice Bowl and pork bone soup. They were all amazing!  Be careful of their portions though, they are crazy large!"}
{"text":"Great little take-out spot. Has limited seating (6) and it's not guaranteed either. Service and food was really good. Tried the pork bone soup and the beef on rice, it comes with 3 side dishes of your choice which is nice. The portions are pretty good and if you get the special package for 2, it comes with a lot of food. I definitely want to come back to try the other dishes as well!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny Korean restaurant in north Scarborough... the Yelp pictures are a little deceiving because there are barely any pictures of the interior but it is tiny! Only seats around 6 people with only one table and the rest is bar stool by the window ledge. It was disappointing that the large spicy chicken was not available nor did it appear on the menu. When asked about it thry said it was sold out yesterday.   Food wise I ordered the beef lunch special for $9.95. Price wise it seems like a decent deal that you get to sample a variety of food. Taste wise it was alright nothing too special but the noodles wasn't  too oily which was good. The presentation of food was definitely not to the picture on the menu. I thought I  would get a bento but it was a plate slap with everything on top. There was a lot of food for the price but just presented poorly. Also ordered thw extra side which was the corn with flake crab and egg salad? The corn was very tough which threw off the taste.  Service wise the staff was friendly.  But overall the restaurant is more for takeout rather than dine in."}
{"text":"Although I'm not Korean it felt like going to grandpa's house. The Pork bone soup was great and had a lil more spice than what other places would serve, which was amazing and just right.  This place touches the heart"}
{"text":"Came here again! :) They are always so nice and the food is always amazing! Got Bim bam bap , side dish meal with rice and pork one soup. Always so yummy.
