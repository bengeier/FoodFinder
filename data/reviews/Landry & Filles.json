{"text":"Checked out Landry et filles during Just for Laughs Bouffons Montreal. Had the ploye- probably one of the better food truck offerings out there. Original and delicious!"}
{"text":"I arrived at the Olympic Stadium quite late in the evening to try out the food trucks. Many of the trucks had run out of food by 10PM but I ended up stopping at the Landry & Filles truck who were still serving food. I tried the Deluxe Meatloaf Sandwich and it was amazing. Every part of this sandwich down to the bread, the sauce and especially the meatloaf were perfect. The texture that the toasted bread added worked really well. I haven't eaten meatloaf in years and this one did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Deuxième visite et toujours autant sous le charme!

Je n'y suis pas allée de main morte ce coup-ci! J'ai essayé leur limonade à la fraise que j'ai adoré. Ça goûtait vraiment la fraise et un soupçon de citron! 

J'ai essayé le pop sicles au melon, concombre et lime qui était super rafraîchissant! Mais je n'ai pas pu en manger beaucoup parce que mon copain qui n'était pas du tout convaincu par la saveur n'a plus voulu me le redonner après y avoir goûté! 

Puis, oui, oui, une troisième chose! Ce n'était pas prévu, mais quand j'ai demandé ce que c'était qu'un oeuf écossais.... on m'a répondu: un oeuf mollet, entouré de crab cake, enroulé de panure et servi frit sur rémoulade de céleri-rave, je n'ai pas pu résister! C'était délicieux!

En plus, le personnel là-bas a toujours d'aussi beaux sourires et est toujours aussi chaleureux. Un de mes deux coups de coeur en food trucks jusqu'à maintenant."}
{"text":"Tried the Ploye with Matane shrimp and the panna cotta. There was so much dressing that you couldn't taste the sweetness of the shrimp, which is the point of having Matane shrimp in the first place. The panna cotta was pretty ordinary with a peach sauce and pieces of gingerbread cookie on top."}
{"text":"On Friday evening we made our first stop at Laundry and Filles' food truck. On the menu was a Caesar Salad made with asparagus, Ploye au Saumon, meatloaf sandwich, fresh apple juice and for dessert a peanut butter and jelly whoopie pie. Off course we tried it all. If was all excellent, but my favorite was the Caesar salad. We've all had a Caesar Salad before, but never had I had one that was based on asparagus instead of romaine lettuce. What an interesting and tasty idea!

The owners are from the maritimes and prepare their menu around traditional, homely themes. For example a ploye, something that I had never come across before, is a popular dish in New Brunswick made with a half cooked (they don't flip it over on the griddle) crepe."}
{"text":"Ok people...here it
You have to try The Meatloaf sandwich...It's out of this world
Add the homemade relish it is honesty The Best sandwich you will ever have

If you do not like the sandwich I will personally refund you your $9.......no joke"}
{"text":"Dans mon top 3 des trucks de Montréal, que dire à part que le personnel est accueillant, la bouffe est bonne et le service rapide?

Leur ploye au saumon est magique une vrai explosion de saveur sur le palais.
Leur uf écossais au crabe est vraiment excellent aussi.
Le thé rafraîchissant fait maison est succulent.
Et surtout le choix des saveurs pour les pop sicles, j'ai goûte le concombre lime c'était magique et tout est fait maison. Ils font leur test. 

Le mieux c'est que c'est santé ^^.

J'ai juste une chose à dire \"zéro hésitation\" . 

J'y suis allez au moins 4-5 fois durant le festival juste pour rire =)."}
{"text":"Pretty good Ploye. I have never heard of a Ploye until I saw it on the menu and ordered it. Since I'm on a diet, I didn't eat the crepe part. The rest of it was good though, and looked just like the picture on this page. 

Warm and welcoming staff. Very friendly. Lots of fun. 

I would come back again and try the meatloaf sandwich, minus the bun."}
{"text":"The line here on sunny, warm Friday noon was so, so long. The line itself also move so slowly which didn't help at all considering it felt almost like 30 degrees Celsius outside under the sun. Anyhow, there were a handful of options taped on the outside of their food truck - 2 main courses, 1 salad, 1 desert, a juice and an Eska water as options. The two mains were the Ploye au saumon (which is basically a few smoked salmon slices on a special unturned crepe and a grilled cheese sandwich with meatloaf inside - both were $9 including tax. The dessert was a rhubarb flaky pastry was $2.5, the cucumber salad is $4, and a juice is $3. All very, very reasonable prices especially when the food is so, so amazing. The wait was long, but so worth it. The meatloaf was excellent very thick and juicy and the grilled cheese was done perfectly. I also got the rhubarb pastry, which was nice, but less impressive. It was very flaky and sweet, but seemed a bit too thick and smushed.

I'm definitely looking forward to having their grilled cheese and meatloaf again, and perhaps try the Ploye au saumon and their very popular juices next time!"}
{"text":"I was able to check them out bear the McCord museum the other day. They had fish and chips, a meatloaf sandwich, some sort of ploye with smoke salmon and other treats. Since I was a tad late, I missed out on the fish and chips, but got to eat the asparagus ceaser salad, very yummy, and their meatloaf sandwich. I wasn't a fan of the sandwich, it's more of a meatlovers dish, but their salad and lemonade was awesome! Hopefully I'll have a chance to check out the fish and chips next time!"}
{"text":"I tried their truck today and ordered a ham ploye, tomato, bacon, squash soup and homemade raspberry lemonade.  The ploye consisted of ham, mushrooms, arugula, parsley and caramelized onion on what I believe is a buckwheat crepe.  It was quite good.  I also was a fan of the soup which had really big chunks of good quality bacon in it.  Service was a little slow but other than that I really like this food truck."}
{"text":"A raining weekend doesn't stop the hungry and most certainly won't stop my quest to check out all the new food trucks here in Montreal. This time around, Landry et Filles were set up near the George-Etienne Cartier statue off Park Avenue (if you haven't guess by now, that's the closest official location near my apartment...) so I headed up on bike to see what they were bringing to the Montreal Street Food scene.

On their website, Landry et Filles states that they aspire to pay homage to tradition all while creating new classics. The menu they offered on the day I was there seemed to match nicely with that \"mission\" statement. Some traditional homestyle dishes focusing on fresh and local produce. A relatively smaller menu compared to other trucks around but no issues with that on my end. There were certainly enough things here to peak my interest.

First up, I tried the strawberry lemonade. A nice refreshing beverage - the hint of strawberry adds a extra sweetness with the tartness of the lemon. A perfect summer drink to enjoy on a hot summer's day - not that it was hot that day but regardless... it fits the experience I was dreaming up for myself that day, so let me have it please.

Second, something completely foreign to me: A Matane Shrimp Ploye. A Ploye is a New Brunswick dish - essentially a pancake of both buckwheat and wheat flour usually cooked only on one side. The flour mixture creates a light and somewhat airy crepe-like base to which Landry et Filles added some Matane shrimp, apples, lettuce and a wasabi mayo as a binder for the whole mixture. The shrimp was nice and fresh as one would expect from locally sourced shrimp. The apples added some crunch and a little sweetness to the mix and the wasabi mayo added just the right level of heat to the dish. All in all, a very nice well executed dish. It is a cool thing to try something completely new to you from a food truck and for that thing to be perfectly satisfying. 

Finally, for dessert, I chose the lemon pie-on-a-stick. Pretty self-explanatory here. Great lemon flavour throughout with a nice crust at the bottom. The outer shell of the pie keeps the whole thing together until you bite into it. Perfect mini play for one's sweet tooth.

All in all, a lovely collection of dishes to be had from Landry et Filles. I was strongly interested in the Meatloaf sandwich but I wasn't hungry enough and honestly I didn't have enough money in my pockets anyway. Based on one of my friend's reaction to said sandwich, I clearly need to catch up with Landry et Filles at least one more time this summer. Looking very much forward to it and I hope you enjoy as well.   

Cheers!"}
