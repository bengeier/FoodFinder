{"text":"If you are a snail or a sloth THIS is the place for you because everything is SLOOOOOW!  We had to search for a hostess, never found her, not quite sure if they even have one. Drinks took forever, food took forever, service took FOREVERRRR 
( insert Squints from the movie Sandlot saying this). We were actually laughing at how long drinks took for nearby tables as well."}
{"text":"Very nice laid back spot.. Awesome foods, and drinks as well. I only gave it a 4 star because the seating can be an issue challenge on weekends. Get there between 5and 6 on Friday and Saturdays to avoid standing !! Enjoy"}
{"text":"In full disclosure, I first contacted the establishment to let them know of my displeasure. As they've chosen not to respond (further reinforcing my view that the folks here just don't care), I'm posting my review to inform everyone else. The cheese fondue was served with moldy bread (that's a little TOO rustic for my taste), my salad (the VEGGIE) had meat in it (I'm a vegetarian) and our server actually said, \"wow , you're batting 1000 tonight, aren't you?\" No apology, no discount, no care or attention paid to the food or experience of the diners.  There are hundreds of places for happy hour; do yourself a favor and skip this one."}
{"text":"The Living Room has good energy.  The music and the open air feel are only enhanced by the specialty drinks.  This is one of my favorite lounge spots in the SE Valley."}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoyed my first visit to The Living Room with my sisters-in-law. 

Atmosphere: 4 Stars. 
I really liked this place. The place is very neat... garage doors that let the cool night air in and the little details of the place are cool. 
The only thing that would have made it better is if they had some soft lighting after dark. It was so dark inside around 8pm that I couldn't read the drink menu. 

Service: 1 Star. 
I think this place might hire people more for their looks than their actual skills at service. Our waitress was scarce until it came time to pay the bill. 

Drinks: 4 Stars. Pricey, but very good. I had the Red Sangria (blah! nothing special) and a peach martini. The martini was delicious and very strong which is a good thing when I'm paying $8 for it. I think next time I'll probably only have drinks here at Happy Hour. $8 for a small Sangria is a bit expensive for me. 

Food: 4 Stars. 
We started with two Bruschetta (steak and Gorgonzola; apple and fig). Very delicious! Next time, I'll probably stick to Bruschetta because they were so good. For dinner, I got 1/2 of a Prosciutto and Brie sandwich and a cup of Butternut Squash soup. The sandwich had one slice of fatty Prosciutto and a thin layer of Brie. Disappointing. The soup was EXCELLENT! If you like Butternut Squash soup, I'd recommend trying it here. 

I'll be going back again... probably during Happy Hour next time!"}
{"text":"I love the Living Room!!  An unexpected and welcomed surprise in Chandler.  The atmosphere and vibe is perfect.  Happy hour prices from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. are some of the best out there.  If you go, you must try the Red Sangria..........  Once a month they have a girls night out for signature drinks and bruschetta - make a reservation!  Where else can you get 3 drinks and apps for $20?

My only complaint is that the music can be a little on the loud side.  I have asked them to turn it down a smidge and they happily did so."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in one night after a movie for a beer.  I have to admit, we were lured in by the vegan snack menu that I had read about, and we were NOT disappointed.  The avocado fries were scrumptious, and the sushi was fresh with really tasty dipping sauces.    We sat at the bar and service was very attentive.  I like the warm, cozy atmosphere, I think it would be a great place to come on a cold winter night.  Also they have table taps at some of the bigger tables, which would be a lot of fun if you had a larger group.  I definitely want to return and sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Probably come about once a month. The service is excellent. The atmosphere is great too. There is really nice outdoor seating and the heat lamps make it comfortable throughout the winter. We've had a lot of items off the menu from sandwiches to salads to fondue, meat and cheese boards, pizzas, and appetizers. Haven't had anything that wasn't good. I especially like the super food salad. Great seasonal beers too!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't good at all too salty or spices and just not as good and not cheap at all.
Even a simple dish like the edamame wasn't good as it had too many spices on it.
Nice musix though. But that's about it. Sorry ...."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at The Living Room for the first time this evening. As a vegetarian, I was happy to see a Veggie Salad in the menu. I ordered the Veggie Salad but unfortunately, jicama was accidently replaced with small turkey slices and a chuck of chicken. I did not realize it until a few bites into the salad... 

I explained the situation to our waitress, who seemed sincerely concerned, apologized and had my order removed from the tab - which I appreciated. 

Based on this experience, and overall concern with their food preparation, we are not dining at The Living Room anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time I have been to this place. I meet some friends on a friday night for gals night out.  First time for all of us and we sat outside on the patio.  The food was great, the staff was friendly and helpful.  The only thing I didn't like is the music was a little loud and it was hard to talk sometimes."}
{"text":"The quiet little town of Chandler is quickly becoming a go-to place with its upscale eateries and bars, and when we found The Living Room on Queen Creek Road, we were smitten. When you walk through the large wooden doors, it feels like you're coming home to your own living room. You're greeted by happy servers who you are quick to call friends, and they make sure you have whatever you need whenever you need it. Ample seating abounds, from rustic wooden tables, to outdoor patio seating, to leather chairs and sofas. Bring your family too, and play some fun board games! Enjoy live music on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and a DJ in the evenings. The food is amazing and the prices are just right. And if your favorite drink isn't on the menu, make sure you talk to Travis, because he weaves a special kind of magic when it comes to specialty cocktails. The Living Room is our go-to hang-out when we need to unwind after a busy week, and I'd be willing to bet that once you step through the doors, it'll be your go-to place time and time again."}
{"text":"I will never go here again after the way my friend and I were treated. We walked in on a late Saturday afternoon around 4:15, the restaurant was not busy at all.The bartender said we could sit any where we would like. We sat outside on the nice comfy couch to enjoy a meal and some wine. After we sat down a woman came up to us and told us we could sit any where we would like except for that particular spot because she had a party coming in at 6:30. I said to her, its not even 4:30. She told us we could not sit there even though the party was not going to be there until 6:30. It was so uncomfortable we just left, what a terrible feeling."}
{"text":"No Happy Hour prices for food??? We walked out of there, ordered nothing. There are so many other places in the valley w/ actual HH deals."}
{"text":"Just another poorly run Chandler restaurant.  How come service is not important here?  Can't tell who your waitress is, manager walks around but doesn't accomplish anything.  Have to fight for a seat, even though your name is on a list, they let people walk in a just grab a seat from under you while waiting."}
{"text":"Fun place! Just went for a few drinks and some snacks and it was perfect evening! Cool atmosphere, friendly, laid back staff. We're from out of town but if we lived here we'd definitely make the living room one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group of 14. The staff was amazing at accommodating our party. They moved tables and seats to make us comfortable. The food was great I tried the shrimp lettuce cups...they were delicious! The oyster shooters were also very good. The music and atmosphere was very upbeat and fun. our waitperson, Taylor did an amazing job getting us our food and drinks out quickly. The manager, Dave was also very accommodating. Very good experience!!!! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"It's crowded sometimes, but I swear it is the only cool hangout in Chandler to date.

Hummus = LOVE. Love the open feeling. Parking can be a bear."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but service was not so great. Waiter did not smile and did not check back with us.  We went in as a group of 7 people and we asked to break the bill, they automatically billed gratuity at 20%. I thought that's illegal?"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a low key date night. Delicious wine selection and really nice house made red sangria. Even a decent craft beer selection. Waitress was very friendly and service was fast!  The ambience was great, saw people in their 20s through 60s all enjoying themselves.  I didn't mind the DJ playing some loud tunes!"}
{"text":"Truly awful food at this place. Hate to provide such a negative review but prompted to do so so others don't make the same mistake as we did.

My wife and I responded to a lunch deal we received on our phones. We had never been to this restaurant and thought we would give it a try. Wife had French Dip with fries. Hoagie roll was stale and tasted like very cheap white, pasty bread. Nothing like a true French Baquette. Broth dip for sandwhich was extremely salty. Tasted like they mixed beef boullion with water. Meat was nothing to brag about. rather flavorless. Fries were terrible, fake, extruded fries not real french fries.

I ordered the Burger and requested a side salad instead of carb heavy potato chips or french fries (only side choices). They want extra two dollars to sub out a side salad.  Rip off and not too friendly to health conscious consumers. I opted for the chips thinking they would be house made. Wrong. Chips from a bag. I only ate a few. The burger was from a frozen patty. Tasteless! Not worth the price they are charging. 

For an appetizer we ordered their pretzel. Bad decision. Bready, soft consistency. Not pretzel like at all. Waste of money.  $8.95.  Way over priced. With $15 off for the coupon we still ended up paying over $35 for lunch.

Won't be going back. Skip this place if you have any tastebuds. You won't be satisfied."}
{"text":"The Living Room is, in all ways, mediocre. The food is decidedly average, the service is noticeably moderate, and the ambiance (while enjoyable and interesting) is subdued by a poor layout. 

I would not recommend The Living Room for dinner of any substance. I would also not recommend this restaurant if you're interested in beer. This may be a great place for wine, although I found it interesting that the display rack was only stocked at approximately 25% capacity. 

In brief: The food is average, but this may be a decent spot for wine and expensive snacks to complement that wine."}
{"text":"Wow. Not sure what happened with the people who had a bad experience here but I am completely obsessed after my first visit here last night. My husband and I moved back here from Santa Barbara and this place reminds me of just that, with its gorgeous patio area, chill vibe and music. We were celebrating our anniversary with a casual drink and decided to pick this place because its down the street from our house. Wine was perfect, great happy hour price and we ordered the antipasto board which was fresh and filling. While we're eating our server surprised us with a chocolate fondue because we had mentioned why we were there. It was extremely delicious and just so thoughtful. Not to mention between her and the bartender we were constantly given attention and great service. I cannot say enough good things about this place. My hubby and I have already decided to add ourselves to it's list of regulars and stop by weekly!!! Well done!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for a Saturday night date. We were seated quickly by what appeared to be an owner. We'll call him \"The Boss\" (tall man with a baseball cap on). The Boss sat us, bussed our table, wiped it down, and then gave us menus. Said our server would be with us \"shortly\". \"Shortly\" was the understatement of the year at this place. The Boss came back about 15 minutes later to ask us if we'd ordered drinks yet. We hadn't.  He ordered and brought us our drinks. 35 MINUTES LATER our waitress Morgan appeared. We'd been watching her serve the couple at the same table we were seated at and several tables near us for the past half hour. We ordered food. Entire order was wrong and Morgan didn't offer to take it back to have it fixed. We were also charged for food portions we didn't order as well as paid for the incorrectly prepared entree. We also watched the Boss seat a new couple next to us and get their drinks as well. The waitress finally asked if they needed new drinks/food an hour and ten minutes later after they had been sat. An hour. And ten minutes. Really? Really. The food here was amazing though. That's the only reason they got two stars. The boss was excellent as well. Hosting, bussing, serving, cleaning, and probably cooking. Food is great but good luck getting service!"}
{"text":"Note: this is a review based on food, I don't drink wine!

I've been here twice and thought the food was great both times! The bruschetta is a must and enjoyed the first four listed on the menu. I cant recall what they are but I'm always happy with them. The place is a bit noisy and pricey. To avoid the noise, I suggest sitting outside because it is well shades, and you can actually talk to and hear what your friends have to say. Also the inside is a bit crowded for me. 

My finance and I kinda stick out like a sore thumb as this place because it predominately caters to older middle-aged Caucasians, and we are quite the opposite demographic, but I wont hold this detail against them. 

The reason I remove a star is because the cost is a bit hefty. If you come here for wine during happy hour, its a great deal, but not so much for the food, hence my initial warning that this post will only be about the food."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a drink and a light bite.  We had the turkey pinwheels and the prime rib sliders and both were quite good.  Great seating for a group to really relax for a while"}
{"text":"A large group of us made a dinner reservation a month prior, and was told upon being stuck in the corner with two crates for tables that they only take \"requests.\"  The owner came over only to blatantly refuse to take responsibility for the misrepresentation on his restaurant's part and rudely interrupt our attempt to resolve the issue with, \"I own other restaurants.\"  

I have never seen such a mistreatment--not even in the snobby town of Scottsdale (no offense, people of Scottsdale).
  
It was unfortunate, because the waitress (whose section we were sitting while making plans to move our night) was sweet."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last weekend.  The place was packed on a Friday night - granted both the Super Bowl and Phoenix Open were in town.  Food was very good. We ordered the prime rib sliders, Korean steak lettuce cups, and chocolate fondue for desert.  All were delicious.  Service was great - especially considering how busy it was.  Our only complaint was the music was too loud.  There were four of us at the table, and it was impossible to have a conversation between all of us.  Turn down the music and I will add another star!  Also, note we were there at about 7:00 pm - a time we want to relax, have a cocktail, and have good conversation with friends.  I can see it being louder a little later....  We have driven by on a Sunday early evening and heard live acoustic music/singing; I guess that is more the vibe we were looking for.   All said and done, we will definitely give it another try!"}
{"text":"What a strange dichotomy.  Great food but extremely uneven service.  I was seated in an area with a waitress who...never acknowledged that I was there.  Other staff tried to make up for her shortcomings but...the verdict is still out."}
{"text":"It's a shame, apparently the happy hour on the weekend is OVER, so my business to this place is now over. Part of the appeal of this place was to enjoy a nice glass of wine or 2 or 3 and have a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Speaking with the manager I was told that since no one else around is doing happy hour on the weekends, Living Room won't either. What a very poor business decision in my opinion. That's the draw, but no more. I will continue to patron Postino's!! Thanks for the memories Living Room, you've just lost a regular!!"}
{"text":"Cute cute cute! We hit up this place last Friday for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. It's got a chic vibe about it with it's dark wood interior, great music, drink specials and a yummy menu. We got there around 5pm and The Living Room was all a buzz with 30 somethings and the occasional 40 something. We both took advantage of the happy hour drink specials and ordered from the menu. After starring at the menu for what seemed like an eternity, I decided on the bruschetta . I had to choose 4 types from a long list but there were so many options it made it tough for me to decide. I really enjoyed the fig, prosciutto & goat cheese...my absolute favorite.

Our waiter was very attentive and not once did we have to go looking for him...huge plus! Overall a great experience for the two of us. It's conveniently located in the east valley with easy access from the lower 202. It's great to see some trendy places popping up in the east valley. :)

We'll certainly return and may even try relocating our regular happy hour crowd to The Living Room. Happy eats! Cheers"}
{"text":"So excited for brunch! Our favorite evening spot, is now a family and pet friendly brunch location too. So nice to have something local/independent in our backyard. The chiliquiles are amazing, plus the kids love the french toast. The service can't be beat."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in AZ. Half off bottles of wine on Sunday you can't beat. This location is my favorite in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I had planned a ladies' night out on a Friday and thought we'd have a great time here. I had only been there once before, on a Saturday afternoon for a bridal shower.
I had called ahead and placed a \"request\" for 9 of us. I arrived a little early and the gentleman (I'm sorry I didn't catch his name) indicated he had earmarked the long community table for us, which was currently occupied. While I waited for other ladies to arrive, I sat down at another table, ordered a drink and relaxed. The gentleman was really good in keeping an eye on the long table and once it was available, we moved on over to it. The staff was great. The drinks were great. The food was great. I had the best tuna melt in my life. It had a little spicy kick to it which was really tasty. 
The only thing that wasn't great about our ladies' night is the music was way too loud. The purpose of a ladies' night is to chit chat and get caught up on what everyone's been up to since our last ladies' night (over a year ago.) Well, we had to pretty much yell at each other and could only chat with the person next to us. It makes sense to have loud music if there's a dance floor. I looked, but didn't see one. 
If we plan another ladies' night out here, we will wait for cooler weather and sit out on the patio instead of inside. Maybe the music isn't quite as blasting out there."}
{"text":"After experiencing The Living Room downtown Phoenix, I decided to try the one in Chandler. If I gave the one in Phoenix 5 stars, this one deserves 6!
The food is the same - excellent, although the menu has a few substitutions to the Phoenix one.
The ambiance is amazing! The curtains remind you of the Taj Mahal, the music is perfect, the crowd - higher quality than other places.
I hope to go back often."}
{"text":"Attractive dining room and solid food. We enjoyed a light dinner of shrimp and sushi at the bar on a recent visit, and had good service. $4 sangria at happy hour was a decent value."}
{"text":"Even though it was very packed, we were seated quickly. The ambiance is good and relaxing. Seems like a good place for a first date or an after work gathering spot. I would've like to have been able to hear the music but the acoustics were poor. The menu selection is limited and I paid $8 for a SPLASH of wine. Probably won't be revisiting"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  HH on a Wednesday evening had plenty of customers.  Food was not only high priced but very puny servings.  The antipasto plate was very disappointing and subpar to other wine bars in the area.  We had sixteen in our group and most of the food disappointed as not only was it over priced, but not presented well.  The tomatoes on my antipasto may actually been canned...couldn't tell  for sure.
Our bottle of wine was removed by the waiter before we could stop him and it still had almost a glass left in it.  I doubt any in the group will return.
I gave it an extra star as I like that you can sit outside which can be a plus.  There are many places around that have better food, service and prices.  A big disappointment as I enjoy the Japanese restaurant next to it."}
{"text":"We love coming here for drinks after dinner. The place has no Happy Hour, but amazing DJ Music on Fridays and Saturdays. Food menu is tasty as well. Even though classified as a wine bar with the typical Bruschetta, they also offer good sushi. People watching is great! On the weekends you also might see some dance happy folks cutting up a rug.. Overall a FUN place!"}
{"text":"So good deserves more then 5 stars. Would recommend.  Has cool couches and tables and chairs. Very casual or you can dress up.  Service was awesome. Would come back"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time.  With the exception of it being very hot inside (had all the doors open no A/C) it was a really for a social area.  We didn't have food, only drinks so I can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"Food was good, we ordered oyster, beef tartar, sear scallop, lamb, lobster bisque, calamari etc. Good food, not the best one I had. Only 1 waiter for all 5-6 tables, so service was extremely slow. 

Also we kept thinking it was Ici Bistro, not \"The Living Room\"."}
{"text":"Loved it. . Jenga game is super creative!   Great vibe and atmosphere.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"a very cliche spot. the food was at best average. the kind of location you might meet your co-worker for a one and done. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food and great service plus a really nice happy hour. I mean this in the best way possible, it's like an East Valley Postino's. I love not having to fight freeway traffic to enjoy some $5 wine and bruschetta during the day :)"}
{"text":"We visited The Living Room with some friends for the first time this past weekend.  We were greeted promply, and were lucky enough to get a table in the extremely busy restaurant almost immediately.  Service was great! The atmosphere was dimly lit and energetic, yet still cozy.  One of the first things that we noticed was the volume of the music (even from the parking lot).  Music selection was good, but definitely could have been turned down!  I feel that I need to note that I have worked in the industry for many years and I am not, by any means, one of those sensitive old people.  Just had a hard time hearing the people right next to me.  Positive note.....didn't hear anyone else in the restaurant either.

Food was very good.  Unfortunately we ordered two dishes that were very similar.  Ingredients were very fresh and the presentation was very pleasing.  Prices were in line for the quality.  

Will definitely be back for another visit.  Would like to check them out on an off night."}
{"text":"Great food & drinks. Yummy cheese plates. Cozy atmosphere. One of the best places in the area."}
{"text":"Did this place change ownership?? It used to be the place to go in Chandler. Now they line dance??
The staff vests need to go!! The hours have changed(for the worse) and the drink prices all went up.  Service sucks and all the great staff that made the place great have disappeared.
Maybe they sold to corporate, but this is not the Living Room that once was!!
I guess I have to find a new home, because this is not my Living Room!  If it was I would move!"}
{"text":"I am a fan. Their food needs some work but they are improving it. It seems to be getting better every time I go back."}
{"text":"get the superfood salad with grilled chicken and the meat and cheese board with olives. absolutely amazing. the California roll is delicious as well"}
{"text":"Great little place. My husband and I are looking to move to Chandler soon and we decided to head over to this wine bar to talk to people and get a feel for the area. We really enjoyed our visit. We have been to wine bars all over the country and this one was unique in its decor and had a very friendly staff and a great $5/glass wine list. I grew up near Napa, CA and love wine. That said, I love a place that has a delightful mid-range selection of wines that have good depth and structure, at a good price, in a non-pretentious (and non-dive bar) atmosphere. Their food was also very good. They had the best pretzel with melted brie cheese dip I've had - and I'm not a huge \"gotta have a pretzel gal\". It was so soft and delicious. I also very much enjoyed a variety of bruschetta and a roasted olive side munchie. We'll be back."}
{"text":"A really good place for wine and cheese and a bunch of friends or for only two. You will enjoy the atmosphere in a tall table, bar, sofa or where you want!!"}
{"text":"I don't like to write bad reviews, but this was one of our worst experiences ever.  Took almost an hour to get a cheese tray.  No excuses, just poor service.  We never got the lettuce wraps.  Nice looking space, but won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is love at first sight and plus some! Went for the first time, on a first date, and couldn't have been happier about my choice! Service was immaculate, drinks upon command (ordered through whom sat me and was on the table in seconds it seemed). Can't leave out the food... Server explained the fact it was a new menu and we were very impressed with the knowledge he had on everything. Didn't need a menu to order! For the fact recommendations were thrown out, opinions on options, to share or not to share.. Love the concept! Can't wait for the 2nd date!"}
{"text":"This place has become my ultimate favorite place to go out on the weekends! I love the set up! So chill yet full of energy! The service was amazing! The food..omg! Best place for your once a week cheat meall! Its kind of the new cool lounge to be at in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite and to relax after a long day. I enjoyed the selection of wine and the awesome fries are amazing. Surprisingly- the sushi is really good. A must try."}
{"text":"I went last night for my birthday with a group of 6. Jonas was our server and he went above and beyond. The happy hour is great, love the ambience! We had a few of the different small plates, the KIG roll was amazing and the cucumber mules were very refreshing. Go! You will love it:)"}
{"text":"Not happy with the service.  I spoke with the manager on site Rick and he was un willing to even sympathize.  The culture starts at the top."}
{"text":"We love The Living Room. Great drinks and food. We have brought many guests from out of town/state, and they've all loved it too!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome happy hour drink specials, but only if they would serve them. On multiple occasions the employees take their time coming over to take an order even when the place is empty. Finally when you do order don't expect to see it for some time. When I asked one of the servers where the drinks are I received an abrupt answer of \"I'm sure they will bring them.\" What??? I just told you it's been 20 minutes, so why not enquire to see if they forgot. I live just down the block, so I really hope they can turn this place around."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this location, but we have been several times to the one at DC Ranch.  Our service and food was good, but we were all disappointed in how incredibly loud the music was.  There was a live DJ and it seemed like the music got progressively louder with each song, to the point when we left we all said our ears were ringing and we would be horse from having to shout over the music to be heard.  It definitely took away from the relaxing, lounge atmosphere we were expecting.

The decor was nice and quite different from the DC Ranch location.  Overall our food was quite good, and we thought it was reasonably priced for how large the portions were.  We ordered the chicken sliders and the 4 piece bruschetta plate, as well as sangria and white wine.  Service was good, and several times we had managers stop by to ask how our food and service had been.  We were there at 4:30 on a Thursday afternoon and it was already busy.  If the noise level was improved we would go back, however it was just so loud on this trip, we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Open air comfortable seating, like being in a living room in the Mediterranean. Food was great, and simple.  Fresh full flavor and the wines were fantastic."}
{"text":"My hopes for this place were high, and I was sadly let down.

1 star- Location:  It was within a decent drive to the house for what I hoped it would have promised. 

1 star- Decor/Atmostphere/music: It was very eclectic and i liked it. Lighting was right, visually appealing, music was playing (decent tunage) and not too loud.

My intentions were to try a few things on the menu, and to try a few different wines. I had relatives in from out of town, and thought it might be nice to take them out to a new place that was different than their normal restaurant experience. Ever since moving to Phoenix, I've seen a trend in unique dining experiences, and wanted to share.

I suppose I might be a little partial, seeing as how my go-to place for a similar atmostphere/menu choice (when i lived in Scottsdale) was Postinos. But since the drive is now much further, I was hoping it was at least comparable.

Nevertheless, the wine that was recommended wasn't even what we were looking for. The waitress openly admitted to being a beer drinker, but liked wine (after she saw our face from our first sip), and failed to deliver with her choices. While i respect the honesty of your lack of knowledge, don't recommend a wine to me please. Just say you're unfamiliar with the selection, but would happy to find someone who is--and sincerely ASK!

From there we ordered the bruschetta, as i was excited to share in this also. My family is Italian, and the type of bruschetta we're used to is nothing like what is offered here, so they were in for a treat.....or so i had hoped.

When our food arrived, it was visually appealing, but as soon as I picked it up i was disappointed--without having even tasted it. The bread was limp, and lacking a crust/crunch of any sort, and the slices were thin. Sandwich bread anyone?

In turn, they had piled the toppings on. Yes, on bread that was incapable of holding the toppings. The flavors were bland, and it was a messy/soggy situation. At that point we chose to ask for our check and go elsewhere. We blamed it on the limited menu that didn't fit all of the guest appetite....but there were obviously other issues. 

I truly wish things had been different, but I will not be going back.

Oh, and PS. This was very much an older crowd when i was there. Since i've only been there once, i can't vouch for what the average age group is, but if you're in your 20's....I would advise finding something a little less \"We're trying WAY too hard to be hip and cool\". 

That is all."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but over priced.  Wine selection was ok, but kept & served incorrectly. \" Is this a Night Club, or a casual adult wine bar?\" \"what, I couldn't hear you over the dubstep\"  Seems hit and miss."}
{"text":"My date and I were excited to try out the Living Room. My date was questioned about her age and was asked if she was an organ donor. Not the best greeting. There was no hostess at the door, so we walked around the restaurant until we found out it was open seating. We sat at our table for 15mins without any service contact. We left and made a plan to never return. We hope everyone else has better luck with the Living Room. Unhappy customers."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We have a great time people watching the North Scottsdale jungle!"}
{"text":"So, tried this restaurant for lunch, and we were sorely disappointed. We ordered drinks from two different servers. My drink was served. 39 minutes later, we were visited by another employee, a totally different one, and asked about the drink. They checked, came back 10 minutes later(mind you we were 2 of 4 customers) and were told that the bartender left on break and forgot. They delivered the drink 20 minutes later. Ok. So that's 50 minutes of wasted time. Finally we flagged yet another server for ordering lunch. It was ordered and so was another drink. The orders came at the same time, cold- several bruschettas and three sammies, and no drink. It took 20 more minutes to ask where the drink was, they list the order. We finally revived the drink upon leaving. We were comped for half a drink. Will never return. Never been to the original locale yet the female server stated several times they were distancing themselves - this seemed like a highly untidy, disarray and poor representation of a pseudo restaurant or place for drinks and nibbles and led newbies like us to see that the company was at arms with one another. Yuck. Food and politics. Eww. Thumbs down. Too many servers and none introduced themselves along with poor drink and food timing equaled a terrible; mind you terrible experience. There were absolutely zero apologies or expressed addresses towards the horrendous service or there lack of. Boo."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life. Summerlicious menu for lunch, despicable to say the least. microwaved, reheated, some ingredient in every dish of the 3 course menu was off, and that was the experience of 9 people who gullibly went today for lunch hoping for a great experience. The waiter took it so personally when one person said she couldn't eat her chicken dish and told her its her problem as everyone else ate their dish. All dishes weren't good,  and we basically tried the whole summerlicious menu. Don't waste your money or be fooled by the 5 stars; but go if you feel like trying your worst meal ever!"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of this restaurant and the food was yummy (when it finally showed up).  The service was AWFUL! Our server kept forgetting to bring things to our table....forgot someone's iced tea, forgot sugar packets, forgot someone's food order, forgot the other half of another person's food order. It was getting irritating having to remind him constantly that he kept forgetting stuff. The last of the food order came out as we were about to leave 90 mins later.  :/"}
{"text":"Best Prime Rib Sliders, Bruschetta, Cocktails and the ambiance is just down right fun. But the best part of our experience was our server/bartender Michaela- she was so on point! She was energetic, friendly, fun, and single handedly took care of our entire 6 person group. Her attention to detail was impeccable and not one thing was missed of our orders or our expectations. We were in awe of her. Wow! Thank you again Michaela for making our evening absolutely Perfect."}
{"text":"Don't read this review wrong, we love The Living Room on Queen Creek.  But, just a few details that move this from a 5 star to a 4 star.  The \"Big Board\" meat/cheese board is not a BIG board, it's small.  Wish they actually had a BIG board, make it really big, with lots of cheese and meat, fruit and perhaps a bit of honey comb.  That would be a BIG board.  Charge $26, we'd still order it. And, why did you remove the home made potato chips from the menu?  That was one of our staples.  Bummer. Still love the feel of the place, very comfortable.  And, the service is way above average."}
{"text":"Decided to meet some friends here for happy hour and was very pleased.  I had been to the original Living Room in DC Ranch and liked it, but I think this new one in the Shops at Gainey is much nicer and has a better vibe to it.  DC Ranch is dark and sultry and this new one is light, airy, hip and loud!  We arrived for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised to find out \"happy hour\" is now all day every day due to summer business.  The happy hour menu has some great options and we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, the pear and fig bruschetta, the California and Tuna roll sushi, a large pretzel and the caprese bruschetta too.  Plenty of food to share among the four of us and reasonably priced at $5 - 7 per item (happy hour prices).  Specialty drinks are all $8 during HH, as well as $5 call drinks and discounted beer and wine.  

We all enjoyed everything we ordered but found the DJ to be a little too loud to have real conversation going.  The place was jam packed by 5:30pm and this was Thursday!  

I can easily recommend this place, especially for the great happy hour deals!  Oh, and service was speedy and thorough.  Seemed like a server was always there to ask if we needed anything else and they were all very friendly.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great service which says lots about the staff and their individual attention.  The food was amazing and the dining/menu recommendations turned out to be spot on!  Went for a birthday celebration with friends - and the food, atmosphere, and wine were perfect.  Will go back there next month again for another \"gathering\" since I can't imagine finding another place with top shelf everything."}
{"text":"Great wine selection, AWESOME food (especially the bruschetta) and a really cool vibe. 

Unfortunately, the music was insanely loud!  I can understand maybe cranking it up later in the night, but we were there at happy hour and you could barely talk because they had the music up so loud."}
{"text":"My gal and I have become regulars at this place.  As a rule we enjoy day drinking so the 11 a.m. happy hour on draft beer suits us perfect.  On weekdays we have the place to ourselves until about 3pm.  The kids that work the day shift are very friendly with fun personalities.  

Can't say anything about the food because as of late I restrict my calories to drink."}
{"text":"This was a great place for happy hour! My girlfriend and I met up here and hung out for a few hours. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy with indoor and outdoor seating. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here! The waiter was great and he treated us like old friends! 
Highly recommend the prime rib sliders and super salad!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband thought lets try this \"wine bar\", i use the word wine bar loosely, and let me just say it was anything but what it was supposed to be! More like a night club than a wine bar! Could barely hear anything the music was beyond loud.The music was not the right type for a wine bar it was rap & hip hop not relaxing type of music, we asked our waiter is it like this every weekend and apparently it is!  A table down from us had 2 nice young ladies just sat down and when they finally received their wine the waitress knocked the wine glass to the ground breaking it. Later on after that fiasco the poor women went to stand up and I heard her say she had a piece of the broken glass in her show and it cut her!

 At least our waiter when we asked what he suggested for a wine selection he knew what he was talking about! There were some pretty drunk people that should have been cut off 2 hours before we even got there and sent home! 

An older couple sat  near us couldn't get anyone's attention for over 30 mins that after they got their first and ONLY drink they just left. Me and my husband have been to a few wine bars and this is hands down the worst place ever to exist when it comes to wine bars!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the only thing that brings me back is the food.  Bruschetta is always outstanding, as is the antipasto board. My wife and I also love to split the chopped salad and a bowl of the turkey and steak chili. Only item we have been disappointed in is the cheese fondue. It is noisy, but is designed to be that way. If you avoid weekend nights it isn't as much of an issue. What sours me is the staff and management have a way to cool for school attitude. They seem to think that this is their hangout and we should feel honored to be a part of it."}
{"text":"Never been, looked nice.  Food was good, but they were mixing up table orders and didn't bring the app.  Oh well...."}
{"text":"I loved the open feel & atmosphere, it could be a fantastic place. Food was average, service was absolutely terrible. I had to ask several times for water, never got a refill & my glass of wine took entirely too long. I hope they get it together because the location & decor are great."}
{"text":"The food was actually really good. I enjoyed the sushi. But the service was horrendous. Possibly the worst service I have ever experienced. The servers walked right by us, and blatantly ignored us. I assume it's because some of our table wasn't ordering alcohol. We booked a table a week and a half in advance as it was my sisters 30th birthday. They sat us on the patio, with half of the seating we actually reserved and said \"they don't take reservations.\" They eventually moved us to an actual table after we complained but ignored us the rest of the night. Our glasses were empty, even after we asked for refills. We never had an actual server. The music was so loud we had to scream to try to talk to each other. The DJ was really good though. We will never be returning."}
{"text":"Hit the new \"hot spot\" Friday night. I'm not seeing what all the hype is about. There was a good group of people there, but the music was SO LOUD; three of us had to scootch our chairs close together and still yelled and had a hard time hearing one another. The wait staff was dressed like they were working back-of-house; two waited on us and took each of our orders at different times and even missed one order because she couldn't hear over the music. They ran out of sushi. The menu is uninspired. End of the night, we struggled to get our checks; one had the sushi on it that had never arrived. The whole thing was just kind of a rookie experience. Nothing to go back for for me."}
{"text":"I wished that my lunch with my daughter was better but it wasn't. First off just happen to look at the HH menu. The waitress said oh, we don't have the oysters  bc they didn't come in. UHH it was lunch. Ordered the \"Prime Rib Sliders\" & Bang Bang Lettuce Cups. This was leftovers from last night, dried out beef that was so over cooked & nooked...no joke ! The butter lettuce was wilted not even chilled at all shrimp was so overcooked & under spiced. Maybe the cook had a hangover like one other review. Never will be back. Way too many other great places in Chandler."}
{"text":"The food was great! But I'm all about service. I was served my McKenna and she made the whole dinner experience perfect! Our food was on time and she made the whole experience awesome! She made my wife and I feel like we were the only ones there! Can't wait to go back and see McKenna!"}
{"text":"The Living Room is a wonderful atmosphere.  The service is great and the drinks are fantastic.  I cannot thank Heather enough for an amazing experience.  She organized a \"Bride's Day Out\" (a prize from the Wedding Expo).  She could not have made me feel more special.  I am looking forward to having more memories at not just the Living Room but the Sushi Room and Chop as well.  Good food and drink are important but I am very thankful for the wonderful friendly staff as well.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a 3 for the drinks, food and environment. Otherwise it was the worst service I ever had. My boyfriend and I were here for 2 hours and only was checked on once and that was due to us ordering."}
{"text":"Great! Great music! Service was slow until Katie O'Neal  took our table! Fabulous!!! Kind of loud but so much fun!!! Food was actually very good. I could see me and my girlfriends hanging here and having a great time!"}
{"text":"This place wants to be Postino, but has worse wine and the food is subpar. We went on a Saturday and out was so loud we could not have a conversation because our was too loud. We will not be going back, try postino if you want a good wine bar."}
{"text":"Andrea is amazing!! best waitress i've ever had! will be back 100% and will enjoy the food just as much as i have before!"}
{"text":"The food was good but watch out for the server Cody. If you don't give her a good enough tip she'll come after you like she did with my boyfriend and I. As a waitress once myself I thought that it was the customers choice to decide how much they should tip you. We gave her a tip amount of $2  which she did not like. As we were walking out of The Living Room she ran after us to ask why we had given her a low tip. I told her it was because I had asked for a drink and waited about 30 mins and decided to cancel the order and to just get our check because I was done waiting and ready to go and it was upsetting to see people who seated in the restaurant hours after we have gotten there get served drinks before us. Since she was confident enough to give us her name incase we had any other concerns to make I am confident enough to let future customers know what may happen if you don't tip this waitress well.She had told us that she had worked her butt off and that she was assigned to a big side and it wasn't her fault which getting assigned to a big side is not her fault but trying to make that an excuse for why everyone got there drinks and not us is her fault and with this being my first time at The Living Room it will certainly be my last because I would hate to be chased on my way out the restaurant if I tipped a server a dollar less than I should have."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience. Made reservations 2weeks ago for a party of 8 outdoors. When arrived with my guests from out of town I was told there was no reservations under my name and that unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me do to limited space. This was my my favorite place but now I will not be returning. Completely ruined my evening."}
{"text":"This places staff was helpful and fun while we were celebrating our friend's Bridal/bachelorette shower on the patio. Comfortable atmosphere and great staff! Food was good too!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! The decor is awesome, drink choices are great, and the food is amazing! I could eat the Brie dip all day! Definitely one of my new happy hour spots for a long day after work with friends!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place, in the perfect location.  It might not be for everybody as it tends to attract people that are into fine wines, and like to dress up even on the most casual occassions.  If you've ever been to Postino's in Arcadia, than you know what type of place this is, which in my opinion is almost exactly the same.

The Living Room is just that, a knock-off of Postino's, but in a good way.  Compared to Postino's it has much more seating, way more food selections, and just a little cheaper.  Where The Living Room lacks is definitely in food quality.

In all, if you're looking for a place with great atmosphere and good finger type foods then this is the place for you.  Always order the Bruschetta! :)"}
{"text":"Sucky wine selection (nothing local), sucky food, sucky service. Do your homework. Go support a true local business that serves local wine. Their passion surely shines through in their operations."}
{"text":"After doing some hiking we found this place and it was just what we wanted. Amazing service and delicious food. Would come back next time we are in the area"}
{"text":"I have given this place three chances now. The seating and location is wonderful. Right on market street and the outside lounging couches are amazing for enjoying the AZ weather. But, and it's a big BUT, the food is terrible. Just not good at all. Last time we went we tried the cheese fondue. It was similar to nacho cheese at a 7-11 and it was congealed when we received it. Stick with drinks if you go."}
{"text":"The French dip was excellent here...that the good thing I have to say. Outside of that it's too crowded on weekend nights and like a club. My server was trying his best but they were so busy it took about 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. I've been a few times now so I've given it several chances but probably not for me."}
{"text":"The Living Room has a nice energy, it's a great meeting place. While there, one of my friends had a complaint regarding the menu and bill. She brought it to the attention of the bartender. I wanted to compliment the bartender on how she handled the situation. My friend was a little more upset than the situation really warranted and I thought that the bartender was nice, professional and customer service-oriented in this situation."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. The staff us great, friendly and attentive. Pricing is very reasonable too. The GM Ryan is fantastic and takes great care of the customers. It's good to see when he walks around and interacts with the customers and they all know him. Definitely one of the best wine & food bars in the valley."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! Drinks were great (wine bottles 1/2 off on Sundays). Also the appetizers were awesome. The seating both on the outside and inside are really cool, will definitely be making this a stop whenever in AZ!"}
{"text":"It was an interesting evening.  It does have great ambience.  Bartenders (ladies) were not very friendly - they did their job, not saying they were bad - just not fun, when you normally visit a place.  Food was good - a bit pricey.  Happy Hour Wine was priced very well.  Introduced myself as a Concierge and, believe me, we can (or not), send a lot of people to restaurant venues and Manager could have cared less.  It was an ok evening but not at the top of my list.  We were at Flemings on Monday and it was a lot nicer."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went to the Living Room on a Friday evening.  It was very crowded which is fantastic to see in this economy.  The first thing I noticed is that it was very loud.  We had to yell to have a conversation.  I guess I was expecting more of leisurely \"Wine Bar\" experience.  I thoroughly love D'vine which is not far from the LR.  I can take my husband there and my daughter who is 13.  Have appetizers and a glass of wine (not my 13 year old, but feel comfortable taking her ;-))  LR is definitely NOT a place for kids.  Much more of a \"bar-scene\" atmosphere.  On a positive note, the food and wine was reasonably priced as well as delicious.  Just not the place to go for a good conversation without leaving hoarse."}
{"text":"We had high hopes and weren't disappointed.  Happy Hour is the way to go (very reasonable).  Does not help on the food bill but big difference on drink prices.  We went with a Brushetta board and a flatbread chicken pesto pizza.  

Bruschetta was good but a little soggy in the middle (it's just not Postino's).  The pizza was actually the surprise hit.  Very thin, crisp and excellent flavor.

Atmosphere is laid-back and not too packed.  Our server was outstanding (can't remember her name for sure- Becky?).  They also had a local playing some acoustic tunes and he was very good.  I am likely partial as he leaned toward lots of 90's alternative music (when people still wrote some decent tunes).

We will definitely return.  Great spot out in the East Valley."}
{"text":"We were big fans of Armitage and were anxious to see how The Living Room would stack up.  We've now been there 3 times.  Love the decor, fun menu, and decent wines by the glass.  The only complaint is that last night the music level was so high that our waiter couldn't hear us and vice versa.  Our table of 4 (inside) had to shout to hear one another  and ended up having to have two one-on-one conversations since a discussion involving all four of us was impossible.  I love a place with good music and the song selection here was cool, but the volume was WAY over the top and it ruined the ambiance.  Fix that and we'll be back every week."}
{"text":"Went to the media launch for The Living Room inside the Windsor Arms Hotel in Yorkville.  Its cozy but luxurious environment is inviting and provides comfort and glam.

The food we tried that are on the menu: Kobe Sliders, Nori Rolls, Salmon Crostini and the Fish were simply delicious, especially the Kobe Beef Sliders!  There's an extensive list of their comfort food offerings in the menu.

There's a computer desk and board games in this restaurantm which really adds to the \"homey\" atmosphere.

The beautiful bar offers over 60 local craft beers with 2 on tap for self-serve (so cool!) and they also offer an impressive premium international wine selection."}
{"text":"The food was not good and is too expensive. The bar is too loud and the lighting was horrible. I would not go there again."}
{"text":"I was invited here by my sister to meet a friend for lunch and a glass of wine. I don't drink but

 went anyway. So glad that I did. Nice outdoor seating areas to catch the afternoon breeze. They had a glass of wine and we ordered lunch. Nice casual ambiance. I am in my upper 40s and just moved to the area. I LOVE having a casual place to sit and talk. I don't think that I will go on a weekend based on the other reviews. I had the salad/sandwich combo as did my sister and the foodwas so fresh. So flavorful. I will be back for another delicious, quiet, casual lunch."}
{"text":"Good place to do snack and drinks. Warm heaters outside; excellent, well trained staff; nice vibe; loud music, but still able to converse. We spilled a cocktail and they brought a replacement before we asked & before we cleaned the first one off our shoes! 
We didn't have dinner, but the apps we had were well done. Home made potato chips and dip; prezzill pieces & mustards and warm Bree cheese. Four of us went and we enjoyed the environment. It's across the street from the bike shop! Makes it easier to find in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely amazing. Glass of Red Zin accompanied with the prime rib sliders and shrimp cocktail. Perfect Wednesday afternoon happy hour. So glad they are opening up a new location in Ahwatukee soon."}
{"text":"My new weekend place. Came in on a Saturday afternoon.  Enjoyed the live music and the great selection of wine and cheese.  Ordered a Cab flight and they gave a great pour for each.  Zack who's service was outstanding tipped me on the weekend brunches and the party crowd on Friday and Saturday nights.  Can't wait to come back.  Rumor is they have unlimited mimosas during brunch.  Not sure.  Math does not compute."}
{"text":"Yikes! Tried it twice and won't be back. Poor service, blah food, nice environment - but a little loud to carry on a conversation. Way overpriced for what you receive."}
{"text":"You'd never expect to find an establishment like this one way down on Queen Creek, but it is situated in a quaint strip of other restaurants.  Inside is a cozy, classy restaurant and bar with a comfortable patio that would be great in nice weather.  

Service is pretty good, everyone is friendly and not overbearing.  

Nice spot for a happy hour.  Grab  friend, a platter of bruchetta, and don't forget that wine is $5 until 6pm!  I'd like to go back and try some more of the menu.  I definitely recommend a stop in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! DJ WAS ON POINT!! Had the California roll and the spicy crabmeat roll.... and yes, it was DELISH! Service was exemplary and good came out in a timely fashion. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So wonderful!  I found The Living Room while trying to find a new spot for weekend brunch.  We showed up around 10:30 and were the first people there so we opted to sit at the bar.  The server was friendly and walked us through the brunch menu giving us a few suggestions for food and beverage items.  They have bottomless mimosas for $12 and they truly were bottomless - I never ran out!  The food was pretty good as well.  I had the chiliquiles and my fiance had the crepes.  The decor on the inside is pretty cool as well and there's a fairly large patio.  The best part was definitely the kind, friendly, and attentive service we received from multiple people.  We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Living Room in Chandler and this new location did not disappoint! 

The menu is the same as far as I can tell, and the interior is similarly inviting.  There is a HUGE patio, however I chose to eat inside since it was pretty chilly outside. Unfortunately it was just as cold inside...

Considering I was the only person in there on a Saturday at lunch time, perhaps it would bode well for them to offer an early happy hour or lunch specials...or perhaps the word just hasn't gotten out yet.  I didn't love Armitage, but hopefully the Living Room will succeed here."}
{"text":"So far not impressed   It's more like being in a disco bar. The music is WAY TOO LOUD
when I asked the waitress if she could turn it down a bit. She basically said no. I come to a wine bar to relax. Not to be in a night club   Call it what it is....night club. All it's missing is the disco ball"}
{"text":"We had a great time enjoying several of the appetizers as our entree. They all hit the spot. The manager came over and helped (not in a pushy or salesman way) US Make our selections. Kind of like giving us the inside scoop on how to order what we looking for.  Most of the items come in threes and there were two of us (you can order an extra one to make a fourth with no fighting. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was great. My friend was visiting from out of town and we wanted a good brunch and some live music but not to be in the middle of the Spring Training madness that is Old Town. The Living Room delivered. We could not have been happier with our food and mimosas. The live music was great and kept us there for a few hours. The service was great; not overbearing but very attentive. Alex and Carol were awesome; checking in when necessary but letting us enjoy our time. 

If you're looking for a low key place to have a few good
drinks and chill with some live music and a classy crowd. This is the spot."}
{"text":"I just celebrated my birthday here last night & the staff couldn't have been nicer. Best service I've experienced in a long time. Our waiter was super friendly & attentive. I don't drink alcohol & he made me an incredible mock-tail that was incredible & made me feel really special. The food was also delicious. We ordered the original & Chop Bruschetta with shaved steak. Yum :-)). My boyfriend had the lamb chops which were mouthwatering. Or friends loved the wine & house beer. For dessert we all shared chocolate fondue with assorted fruit, marshmallows & graham crackers. OMG, it was a big hit all around & we didn't leave a crumb behind. I'd totally recommend this restaurant for the incredible service, delicious food & upscale atmosphere that included fantastic music."}
{"text":"Such an awesome environment! Cool vibe, great service, awesome happy hour prices and Mikey is the best!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Our waiter suggested a really good Spanish Red Wine that went great with my Traditional and Italian Bruschetta. The French fries and the chocolate fondue for dessert is the perfect night topper! A DJ came on and played some 90's and Top 40's hits. This is a great place for a girls night."}
{"text":"happy hour prices are really good.  appetizers are okay to above average.  staff friendliness/promptness/etc has been hit-or-miss.  If you're looking for a cougar, it's the place to be."}
{"text":"Great food! What a good little place to go and eat! The shopping area is great and the food here is perfect! The drinks are great! Outside patio is comfortable. A little small when it gets packed it feels cramped. But overall a 4!"}
{"text":"I love the comfy sofas out on the patio, heaters when needed, the wait staff always friendly, food has been great - if there is an issue, they are happy to fix it, sports on the TV's, Music playing that makes the ambiance better...love this place !"}
{"text":"Really nice staff. Outside area was wonderful to sit in. Very pet friendly and the food was great. 

The staff opened the second outside area for us because their first area was filled and we had pets. That was really nice that they went the extra mile for us. That tells you the kind of place this is. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Perfect for a chill evening of wine, spirits, and good apps! Sat on the big couch with my wife and ordered fondue and a bottle of wine with a flat bread. Excellent! Service was good as well especially since they were very busy. Would like to see more old world wines on the menu but that's just being picky. Atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"This place was a little strange.

We went on a pretty busy night, there's not much of a lobby or designated waiting area/host stand. There was a man running around doing multiple things (owner/manager maybe?) who was doubling as a sort-of host and I guess keeping track of who came in first and how many people in his head. It was odd getting directions like  \"okay, there's a table over there that just paid, when they get up, go sit there\". What??

The server was nice but ditzy. She greeted us promptly and took our drink orders but then had to come back again because she forgot what I had ordered. The food came out quickly and was very tasty. However, we didn't have silverware, I asked for it when the food was delivered (by a different girl, not our server) and she didn't bring it. So we sat. And waited. And waited. Finally we realized the other girl wasn't coming back with the silveware any time soon and our server was missing in action so we just started eating with our fingers (it was bruschetta and the bavarian pretzel so it was possible to eat without silverware, just messy). By the time our server made an appearance we were almost done.

The music was very loud and more club-like, a little identity crisis I think. 

As the night went on, it slowed down and then the free-for-all with the tables seemed to be less of a cluster so maybe it's just not the place to try to navigate when it is busy."}
{"text":"Just like its name, the place makes you feel like party in your own living room. It was a large space with lots of seating and open air! DJ is great, I enjoyed the music. Dress up or dress down, its nice and casual...Great Neighbour hood place to hang out."}
{"text":"I've been here many times after work and I really love the atmosphere and decor of the place.  The patio is relaxing when it's not too hot.  The food is great and there is a pretty good wine selection.  We used to get good service here, but for the past few months it's just not there anymore.  It's a little awkward when you walk in because you're not sure if you can just sit down or wait for a host, but it is open seating.  The servers share the entire restaurant (no sections), which makes nobody accountable for anything.  We watched a table sit down for half an hour, they never got greeted so they just left.  It is difficult to find a server when you need one, and they seem pretty rushed when you do get their attention.  I hope with their new remodel, they can bring their service back to what it used to be...attentive, efficient and very friendly.  My boyfriend doesn't want to ever go back, but I'm giving it one more chance."}
{"text":"First visit -out of towner   Food Poisoning!! Late afternoon tuesday, Oct. 20th
Had only appetizers:  lamb chops, caprese and potato chips/dill
Cramps started followed - spent the night in the bathroom.  Was unable to eat
anything until the following late afternoon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the wine presentation. We had wine flights and the wine boards were dirty with wine spills.  Also, watched a waiter \"cop\" an attitude with a couple who decided to go else where. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I really like the Mozzarella, pesto, tomato appetizer the drinks are a bit sweet for my taste and over priced. It's a nice quiet place to hang if you are in the area."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!! This place was perfect!!! I went  there for dinner last night with my LitSisters, Terri W, Robin K, Christine B, and Crystal C. We sat outside in a little living area (oh, I get it) which felt quite intimate despite being part of a restaurant. The service (from Becky) was terrific, even though at one drink each and some food, we didn't run up a huge bill. 

First off, since it was ladies night, they had a healthy list of delicious wines for $5. The ones I tasted were delicious. For dinner I had four pieces of bruschetta - prosciutto, fig, mascarpone and pepper jam; steak, gorgonzola and creamy horseradish; Apples, brie, fig jam, honey and agave nectar; and roasted peppers, goat cheese,  garlic and tomato jam. I've listed them in order of deliciousness for your convenience.

They had live music on a Monday night which was done well - not lounge lizardy but not overpowering. The place was packed and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Oh, and did I mention that they gave all the women flowers.

I can't wait t go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch, ahi tuna salad was wonderful. My husband had French dip and he loved it. David made sure  we had everything we needed, and was very helpful when we had questions. Bar is well stocked, and music was great."}
{"text":"It has a nice ambience, service was fine but the food has no wow factor to it, small portions and is very overpriced. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food, ambience, bottomless mimosas ($12 with entree) is fantastic. I want to give a shout out to Marshall, one of the best waiters I have had in awhile!"}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance and decor. We had the flatbread pizzas...the pesto chicken and buffalo chicken. They were very good. I preferred the pesto. The service was prompt, attentive and friendly.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Living Room Friday night to check it out. We got there at 5:15pm. Thr parking was a nightmare and the  place was packed. They said they had plenty of seating available,  which I was shocked, but pleasantly surprised  to hear. Next thing I know,  we are sitting in a \"booth\"( barely enough room for one person on each side) in the bsck room  of the restaurant,  looking at the kitchen  amd the bathrooms.  This room has ZERO ambiance.  But we wanted to try this place so we went to order some appetizers on the happy hour menu. I wanted to order the sliders, but in reading more closely,  it is only ONE  slider and a beer.  The problem is, I don't drink beer. I asked if we could change the beer out for a 2nd slider....the answer was NO.  They have to bring the beer whether you want it or not. S.o we went ahead and ordered it. It was just OK. We also ordered the edamame, pretzel and California crab rolls.  I have to sat that the crab rolls were the best I have ever had. The edamame had a great seasoning on it,  but was overcooked. The pretzel was good but not exceptional. The wine poor were small. Service was not great, but they were packed. We left thinking that we needed to give it another try. So on Sunday, we went in at 1pm. It was a rainy day, so the patio was closed and it want crowded.  We were looking to just relax on a couch and drink some wine. I was pleased to see it wasn't crowded amd there we lots of couch/chair seating  available.  The host seats you no matter where u want to sit,  so I said we would like to sit at one of the couch/chair sections.  He informed me that they had to dave them for   larger  groups. I looked behind me and no one was there. The place was NOT busy amd I was willing to spend money for wine and food at their establishment.  They told me they could sit me I a \"booth\" in the back of the restaurant.  I shared with them that I had just been I the \"booth\" on Friday amd we were looking for a more comfortable place.tp sit, with more ambiance. They told me we.would sit in a high top table or low table I the bar. They would not allow us to sit in the couch/chairss. Needless to say, we left.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Went during lunch with my colleagues so could not try off their wine/liquor list but the food and decor did not fail us.

We sat outside and enjoyed a nice spring day in Arizona. Pre-summer so able to enjoy lunch without the heat.

I ordered their mix greens salad with chicken; the greens were fresh and the chicken was seared to perfection. My company both ordered sandwich combos (chicken salad and tuna melt) and both said it was really good.

I will definitely be returning and hopefully check out their happy hour that is 11 am - 6 pm daily - can't beat that!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always amazing. Prime rib sliders are to die for and the bang bang shrimp app is a must. Great place for a ladies night."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks and no food and never got any attitude about not ordering more. Service was prompt, welcoming, and consistent - they kept checking in on us which was nice. I loved my glass of spanish rosé and tried my friend's cocktails which tasted delicious as well. We DID end up getting the injectable donuts which were so worth the calories. It comes with two plastic needles filled with filling for the donuts. Genius! And so fun!"}
{"text":"Cute place!!!! Loved it!!! I had fitness wrap and husband has breakfast sammy. Food was good but the ambiance is cute. Good place for a cocktail or glass of wine for a bit with friends!"}
{"text":"What a damn good time you are destined to have while visiting \"The Living Room\" for brunch.  No joke!  

The really good: 
Bottomless Mimosa price.  It's $12 bucks with 1 cent refills. 
The seating arrangements for a large group is amazing.  Because the restaurant is so open, it's more than enough space to accommodate a large party.  There were 20 women in my party.  We were seated outside in the patio area (located in the front of the restaurant).  When it got a little too hot we were able to close the drapes so that was perfect!  

The Good: Service was exceptional!  Our servers Nicole and Kathy were so attentive to us and VERY patient.   I realized I like my mimosas with champagne instead of sparkling wine.  The Living Room makes their mimosas with sparking wine .. Just an FYI.  The food is good but not great .. far from great.  Which leads me to the Bad.

The bad: We had a party of 20.  4 of us had to send our food back for replacements. Either the hash browns were brunt or overcooked.  So much so that you could pick your entire side portion of hashbrowns up with your hands and it wouldn't fall apart.  It looked like a crispy, brown piece of something.  When they sent out new ones, they were great. So that's a plus.  One person had to send her French toast back because it was brunt.  Honestly, it looked more like toasted bagels vs. French toast (see the pics).  2 other people received a hard fried egg when they ordered scrambled eggs.  This was the kitchen's fault, not the server so we understood. 

We all agreed we would totally return to The Living Room for brunch again, knowing what to except with the food this time."}
{"text":"Stopped in while in town for a wedding, it's directly across the Hilton Home2Suites in a really nice shopping area.  Great environment, friendly staff, and efficient service.  

We were seated promptly and we liked the variety of cocktails, wines, spirits, and overall menu.  They are the self-proclaimed the home of the $4 Sangria which is pretty legit.  

They offer a small variety of seating that ranges from table top to lounging style sofas for more intimate parties.  

Had a great time here with extended family and would definitely recommend and would be back if in town again."}
{"text":"I really like this place...the location is amazing the service is great.  We love wine and they have a nice selection."}
{"text":"5 Stars for sure! Awesome atmosphere a great wine bar/lounge without having to go all the way to scottsdale. If you are looking for a good chill time in chandler this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Whenever we have guests in town we take them here, and everyone loves it. Such a unique experience with all the couches. Their happy hour offers some really nice pricing."}
{"text":"Made reservations here for my wedding dinner. We had a brief confusion in plans so I canceled the reservations. Once we had everything figured out, though, my husband re-booked the reservation. He received an email confirmation and then even confirmed a third time over the phone. The night of, we show up to be told that they had no reservation for us and \"accommodated\" us in tiny chairs with a tiny table on the patio. Then they caught their error and said they thought his reservation was the one that was canceled. Totally horrendous and we spent over an hour waiting for them to move us to a more comfortable area. They never did. I came here once prior to this, had a good experience and wanted to share with my loved ones. Instead, the living room ruined my special dinner"}
{"text":"First visit on a Sunday afternoon. Great wine  and apps and live acoustic music - cozy pub atmosphere. Manager David greeted us personally and made some recommendations. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a two because the food is always overcooked. I ordered the chicken waffles and the chicken was so hard that I scraped the roof of my mouth. I also tapped it as hard as I can against the table and it would not break. That is very concerning. My friend tried to order the Nutella and banana crepes and it was disgusting. There was Nutella in there but it tasted like the banana only. I am not sure how that happened but it did. The bananas were Bruleed and they tasted terrible. The only thing that is great about this places is the,donuts. And the mimosas that are bottomless. The bacon, if you are going to order it ask for it to be regular because regular means it will be crispy. If you order it as crispy it will come out as burned so beware. They had a live singer which was nice and atmosphere is really cute and very upbeat. Otherwise I would skip this place and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We enjoyed great service and music.  We had the crab cakes and oysters which were well preprared.  The wine list had a good selection from $30-110 from US to French wines.  Overall a good experence."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour with great prices.  Terrific music on the weekends.  Definitely a place you need to check it out!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Living Room! Great drinks and specials and the food is surprisingly great! Not the youngest crowd in the world, but a Sunday funday outside and the great live music makes up for it. 

I have been here a few times on a Saturday night and it does get pretty crowded and the parking isn't great. Lots of other good restaurants and bars around, but this is my starting place every time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and drinks. However I just checked by bank account and the waitress added more money to her tip. This is unacceptable behavior and the manager need to have a serious conservation with their staff."}
{"text":"The food here was not good.  The flatbread came on a cracker (like a matzo cracker).  The bruschettas tasted like they just threw some chicken salad onto leftover bread.  The chicken salad itself was not very good.  The red peppers were actually very good on the greek bruschetta, but needed to be on different bread.  The music also made the experience unenjoyable (random 70's maybe?).  On top of that, when we first sat down 3 people asked if we needed anything.   By the end, we had to go find someone to get our check.  And so did the table next to us.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice place. They have a lot of several of my favorite things: Wine from California, Vodka, cheese, and couches. Was a nice place to come and spend time with friends on a scorching hot day. They have every flavor of midlabel (Pinnacle, I believe) Vodka you can think of and serve up spritzers in pint glasses for 7 dollars. That's not a happy hour price, but many wines, beers and well drinks are included in the daily hour until 6pm special. Would have loved to stay longer, but had to venture out into the heat sometime. Servers were attentive and friendly. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for brunch and ordered the chilaquiles and the French toast. I have celiac and the chilaquiles (fried egg, chicken, corn tostada, cheese) were a great gluten free option! Every other menu item has bread in some form. 

The crepes looked great but also tiny so we passed. My bf got the French toast with the whipped maple cream and said those were delicious. Each brunch item is between $9-12. 

Also, the bottomless mimosas are $12! A steal in this area."}
{"text":"Slow service but the food was scrumptious once it came. Arrived at noon after working out and hungry!  Had no idea they do not give a bread basket until I asked after 15 minutes. Unusual. 5 minutes later I was shaky and desperate so I ordered the grilled bread which came complimentary....total wait for food 25 minutes...........not the place it used to be. Too bad."}
{"text":"AKA the Middle Age Frat House!

If you're bored on a Friday or Saturday around midnight, this place offers an upscale atmosphere with comfortable couches for people watching...and wine! What could be better, right?! 

Service is a bit slow, though friendly."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this location yesterday...we came for brunch and were drawn in by the $12 bottomless mimosas.  We got dropped off and instantly were excited about the live music...so good!!  We were seated in a couch/chair set up, which was really comfy and I absolutely loved the place!!  It's very trendy, the decor is fantastic!  We ordered food and the bottomless...I had the veggie crepes, and then also we had: berry crepes, chilaquiles, and eggs Benedict.  All were delicious!! The bottomless mimosas were a bit heavy on the OJ side so we asked the waitress (Jessica) if we could get just champagne in our next pour so she brought out the bottle and refilled for us!  Very cool!!  We also had three shots of tequila, which were unfortunately the only pics I managed to get...but I love this spot and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Prime rib sliders were delish
Loved the drinks 
And our server (Matt I believe was his name) was fantastic! 
Great service/cool ambiance 
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For ambiance and drinks, it was very enjoyable but the food, not so much. I ordered a prosciutto and Brie sandwich and it was basically made with dry, white bread-like toast, one piece of prosciutto and I think there was some Brie in there. Couldn't taste it....Not quite sure. SO disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. The frys with Brie is are addicting. Great ambience with love music. The service is great as well, our server Travis took great care of us! Not one bad thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"In follow-up from my previous review, this place still holds up very well and keeps earning five stars in my book. We walked again to the patio and enjoyed the wonderful ambience. Nice cocktails, good music (not overly loud and good mix). Friendly and prompt service. Will surely come back!"}
{"text":"Expect more for a $10 sandwich. This is next a series of all mediocre reviews. Friendly servers but it needs some creativity in the kitchen and please show the chef where the spice rack is"}
{"text":"Wow was I impressed with this place! As a server myself, I recognize and appreciate excellent service. My server's name was Megan and she was fantastic. Very friendly, made no errors, and brought everything out in a timely manner. The food was equally fantastic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  Feels like brunch is forced here. 

Frittata - had a few pieces of sausage, no parm and some spinach.  If I didn't put hot sauce on it I would not have eaten it because it would have just been a cooked egg. 

Over easy egg - came out raw in the middle time 1. Yes we want the yolk runny NOT the white part, sent them back.  Came out the same time 2.  Eggs are not hard to cook, if you claim brunch figure it out

Service - friendly but slow

Coffee - sad this was the high point

For the amount of breakfast options in the area there are WAY better options"}
{"text":"So I used to really like this place (5 star level).. I would visit if not weekly at least 2x a month with coworkers.  The wine glasses are $5 each until 6pm and their menu was decent and healthy (and filling) for something to munch on while pounding wine glasses (btw, I don't advise 'pounding' wine ... at all!).

Lately, when I've gone, Iv'e noticed the wait staff is VERY lax... as a matter of fact when I was there tonight, the guy server just tossed the bill at us.  Yes, \"tossed\".  Add to that that the gals serving nearby and also serving us were waaaay too busy playing eye-candy for the old, fat Chandler farts next to us.  They were too busy hugging and giggling with the old (not even good looking) male farts to get our drinks and our checks in a timely manner.  That was just plain annoying.

The owner is something else, too.  That guy is there nightly,, flirting away and getting sauced.  Good for him that he can enjoy life like that, but if his staff was tip-top, I'd say he's doing a good job and deserves celebrating his success..... but since they aren't, I'd say he needs to focus on getting his staff tip-top before some of us former loyalists abandon ship (which a lot of us have from my work group).

The decoration and atmosphere were nice... I really liked the outdoor seating.. It was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food and service. I've been to 2 other locations and decided to try out the Scottsdale one since it was close.   It was cold outside and decided to order Chicken tortilla soup and Bruschetta.  The soup was not soup it had the consistency of puréed tortillas Similar to baby food. The Bruschetta was just ok , not Postinos that's for sure.  Everything is so over priced . I was expecting the service to make up for that but sorry to say it was not good.  I asked for another glass of wine never received it but it was on the bill.  Not very attentive staff.  Took 15 mins to get someone's attention to get the bill.  I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Incredibly unimpressed with this place. The ambiance & environment were incredible. That is where it ended. The food was average at best and the service was terrible. 

As a former sever, I always give servers, bartenders and chefs the benefit of the doubt. However, it was not one isolated incident that led me to write this review but several issues. I had to send back my mixed drink because it was made incorrectly and then it took over 20 minutes to get a new one - in that same time another member of my group ordered and received their drink. I had to ask twice where mine was and after receiving several conflicting explanations from the manager and the sever I finally switched to wine to simplify the process. Later on I ordered a refill on my white wine, and they brought my friend's red instead - they confused who had what. 

When the checks arrived, they included two drinks that we did not receive and incorrectly split up our groups items. It took 30 minutes to correct the issue. I could go on and on, but long story short I won't be returning soon. It was a frustrating experience to say in the least and I do not consider myself the harshest of critics."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Great vibes, good times.

Sliders are next level, cocktails stay flowing, good looking people, all around fun spot. 

I go here once or twice a month and unless something drastic changes, I will continue to do so. 

3 words- Grand Marnier, neat."}
{"text":"Patios like this with the AZ weather are the best! We had a good size group and took up most the patio but the server was able to keep our drinks filled and food when we wanted it with no problems! They have a good wine selection, great appetizers, and great service. There was live music on Sunday evening. I am really glad to have found this spot that I didn't even know existed. The brucetta's were great, I had 3 of them! Someone in our group said the cheese dip was really good as well. 2 glasses of wine and 3 bruchetta's were a good deal at just over $20."}
{"text":"I met my girlfriend at the Living Room the other night and we had a blast. The food was really good and the drinks were AMAZING. The staff was pushing wine but I wasn't in the mood for that so I tried one of their \"skinny\" cocktails. I was a blueberry martini and it was soooooo delicious. It was the perfect place to relax after work. The decor was very nice, similar to that of a large living room:) Leather couches, long drapery, dark wood furniture, etc.They also have live music. Usually I'm into it but not that evening. His amp was up way too loud for an acoustic performance and we had problems having a conversation, but other than that it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We've only been here once & probably will not be returning. When we walked in, there were quite a few people waiting to be seated. We were at the door for probably like 15 or 20 minutes ... Only because we had heard so many good things about this place that we decided to wait. Finally someone came up to us to let us know to wait & we gave our names. We waited probably 30 or so minutes after that & I really wish we hadn't. We were seated at a small table in the corner next to a large party. We ordered the turkey pinwheels & bruschetta plus some drinks. Nothing was bad but nothing was great enough to rave about. The restaurant was so loud it was hard to speak & hear each other. There are definitely other wine & bruschetta places in town that offer much better food/drinks & service."}
{"text":"3 poor experiences prevented us from even dining at this restaurant. We wanted to see live music and knew The Living Room had live music on Sundays and called to find out what the hours were. The guy who answered the phone (shortly before 2pm) stated there would be music until 8pm. He confirmed that they would be playing \"straight through 8pm\". 
When we got there just after 4pm, no music. After reading the sign on the wall that stated the live music was 10-2pm and 5-8pm on Sundays, we stood at the door to be seated since we were already there. One employee fiddled with the TV by the door, looked straight at us, gave us her back and then began rolling napkins. A waitress walked by with dishes in her hands, paused and told us to sit anywhere. I asked where the music would be, inside or outside? She replied that she didn't think there was anymore music for the day and walked away with no suggestion to actually find out for sure. 
Needless to say, we headed for the door, so many better options in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Great food. Drink was good too! Will definitely go back even if it is 30 miles away."}
{"text":"Checked the living room outafter we met a couple ladies who said they loved this place. What on earth were they thinking???

NOISY! Staff didn't smile, Appetizers were at best mediocre (steak Bruchetta was tough as shoe leather and tasted like the steer had been roaming the range for a couple hundred years). Chicken Bruchetta was a total waste of time. Even though we were extremely hungry, we left half our appetizers untouched.

With so many EXCEPTIONAL choices like Brio, The Keg, Cork, Down Under and others, we don't understand why the place is so crowded...
the only thing we suspected is that it might be a pick-up joint... lots of older guys and young to mid-age women. Definitely NOT a couples place."}
{"text":"Cool location and vibe. Food was pretty good. Two drinks that I ordered were bad. Weird mixture for a plain marguerita and a red sangria. Quick service. Would like to return to try a few other things here."}
{"text":"Good appetizers and decent wine selection... nice atmosphere. Super fun for lunch..."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a friend hereon the fly. It was really comfortable and service was good. We  had the Bruschetta and it was tasty. It was a comfortable and casual place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place since it opened. We had some out of town guests so we decided to take them here. When I got there, there was no seating outside and it was beautiful out so I asked the manager if a spot opened up could we take it? He said of course. When a group of people left, he was on it. Even though they were busy, he was still keeping an eye out. The staff was amazing & so was the food. We had 6 of us and we ordered 6 glasses of wine and the manager came over and said he could save us a little bit of money by selling us a bottle, and I dont think they even have bottles on their menu. I thought that was great! I don't know a lot of places that would do that. Most places want you to spend more money. We were there for about 4 hours, lots of bottles of wine and we had their hummus plate, prime rib sliders, brusetta and fondue for dessert. Our waiter was awesome! We will for sure be back! The only complaint I have is that the happy hour, to me starts too early. My hubby doesn't normally get home from the office until 530. So I told my hubby that he needs to get home earlier so we can hit the happy hour often. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Really solid chilaquiles and open face sandwich for brunch today. Service by Zach was spot on with excellent recommendations. Tasty bloody mary sealed the meal."}
{"text":"Good location and atmosphere. However, there food quality is mediocre and the selection is pretty sparse. Mostly small plates made for sharing. Finally, if you like beer, look elsewhere. The beer selection is one of the worst I've ever seen (gag)!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - Lots of variety of seating - couches and comfy chairs - including out on the patio.

Service was awesome.  Seemed to be more of a team than just one person.  Any server walking by checked in and helped if needed.

Great food.  Club sandwich was good.  2 people had the French Dips and loved them.  

Timing was off for the chicken on one of the salads but minor hiccup in a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and great for drinks with friends or a date. When we went we had an elderly person with us so the seating isn't really optimal for that. I.e. Low tables (coffee table style) or regular tables with hard chairs. I like the set up and I will be back but probably just sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"By far the cutest location of The Living Room. Zach nailed his wine recommendation and brought us something perfect. The food was wonderful and the service exceptional. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really Liked this place but don't expect to have a quiet intimate conversation.... place gets packed after work hours.  Good wine list and great menu for a wine bar!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is delish, the atmosphere so relaxing, wait staff friendly and attentive. Have introduced several of my friends to this great place and they all love it!!!"}
{"text":"Update: July 29, the rude bartender added $2 to his tip on my bill! 

Original review July 2016
This place has gone downhill big time! My last visit was over a year ago (had fun and good food) but I went there again this weekend with a large group on a wine hop. This was our 2nd and worst stop and we didn't stay long. We even told some friends on their way not to bother. We all went to the next place. The bartender was very rude for no reason and was very slow, chatting with other servers at the register for 10 min before greeting us. Then service took another 10 minutes (at the bar!).  He gave us 2 lectures about choosing the bar OR the nearby tables so tabs would be with 1 person. We had a large group and wanted to use both. The manager came by later and just thanked me for my feedback on the rude bartender. We're all 40-50 years old and not hell raisers by any means so I have no idea why they didn't want our business. Or maybe they're snobs, or new or unskilled at customer service. They passed up 12 people having non-happy hour drinks and snacks. Never again. 
BTW our fav stop was Rhythm and Wine. We had the opposite experience there."}
{"text":"The Living Room has a good feel to it and my wife and I were happy to go after dinner to have a few drinks and relax and talk. The first time we sat outside which was great and the second time we were inside and the music was WAY TOO LOUD!!!! We went out to get away from our kids and noise!! If I wanted to go to a club with a bunch of 22 year old beat boxers, I would have driven to downtown Phoenix. It appears that the clientele is mainly in their 30's and 40's and I promise you they aren't looking to scream and shout over a few glasses of wine with their friends. 
To the owners, send your laptop DJ packing and get a stream of mixed music that is not too loud. No one is coming to your place to with the intention of staring at the people they came with while listening to thunderstruck and drinking a $70 bottle of Cab. Sorry, just the truth!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Atmosphere is great, wine is very good as well as the food. Happy hour is a deal!
Try the injectable donuts. They look fantastic."}
{"text":"Poor service. Called for Mother's Day reservations far in advance. Got their voicemail which said they'd call back. They didn't. Left multiple messages even with details about when I wanted reservations and no call back. I finally reached them and they said they were full   and had been for 3 or 4 days. If they had called me back as they said they would I presume I would have gotten in. When I (nicely) gave this feedback to the guy who answered the phone and told him I'd have to try someplace else, he just said \"ok\". Clearly they are so special they don't have to care about potential customers. Makes you wonder how they treat the ones they already have. There are many other restaurants to choose from in this area. I will never be trying this one nor will I recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I honestly believe some of the bad reviews for this place are fake. 
Went here with a friend while I was in town, we got spinach dip, bruschetta, and the donut holes. All were very good!! The service was great and who doesn't love their outdoor seating? It's such a great atmosphere.

 I would definitely return here! Especially on a nice day.
And it's dog friendly!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to The Living Room a couple times. Fortunately, we've had Carter every time. He is a great server and very accommodating. We will always request him. Great food. $4 Sangria is un-heard of and it's delicious!!  Tortilla soup is creamy, not thin. Chips are fresh and awesome!!  Love that you can grab items off the neighbor restaurant menu, La Sala."}
{"text":"Server for brunch was great and food to match.  Noticed another server wearing shorts with her butt cheeks hanging out as I'm trying to enjoy brunch with my girlfriend.  That wasn't the issue, the fact that the other server with the shorts had a pad of paper to take orders and a \"Linving Room\" pen shoved down the front of her shorts was the disturbing part.  Our original server ran my card, her co-worker proceeded to drop the c.c. receipt with the pen she had shoved down the front of her shorts.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"A lot can happen in year, particularly for The Living Room.  

When Summerlicious 2015 was announced, I remembered with daydreamy awe, the gastronomic wonder my partner and his family devoured last year.  For the record, I've always been leery of hotel restaurants as the fare, in my opinion, is predictably sub-par.  Last year, The Living Room was the exception.  This year, it was sadly the rule.

The menu is marketing brilliance at it's best.  The ingredients, the flavours...all fetchingly delicious.  BUT, what's with all the deep frying?  Ok, so I ordered the calamari ring (\"Ring of Calamari\") to start and ok, maybe I should have known that it would be served battered and deep fried even though there was no mention of it, but where in the next description does it suggest that battered and deep fried avocado would be served up?

Black Squid Aioli, Soy Salmon Tartare
Cucumber and Avocado Wasabi

Deep fried avocado is like something a food stand at the CNE would dream up to serve something \"healthy\".

For the main, I ordered the dry-aged rib eye with avocado butter sauce, grilled corn and red potato summer salad.  Mmmm, sounds good, right? Unfortunately, not.  The potato salad was probably the worst I ever had.  I think the potato was cubed and roasted and then left in the fridge uncovered to dry out before dressing.  The rib eye was undercooked for medium and in hindsight, I should have sent it back, but was disheartened.  

Still, in an effort to cheer to up, I told my partner that dessert would redeem.  Again, unfortunately not.  I ordered the gorgonzola cheese cake and rhubarb compote thinking that the gorgonzola would be delicately infused in the cheesecake, but no, it was planted on top with metallic decorative balls that parents buy when they're baking cupcakes with their children.  My partner had the avocado chocolate mousse and it was not only adorned the same decorative balls, but it also looked and tasted like it was in the fridge for some time uncovered.

Service was bewildering.  We were served water shortly after we were we seated and we later ordered a bottle of sparkling water.  They brought another pair of glasses, but the same as the water glasses.  It was clearly confusing as we often had to stop them from pouring sparkling into the regular.  I'm no waitress, but how about using different glasses?

When our dinner plates were cleared, we were asked the usual, \"how was it?\"  I lamely replied, \"alright\", and the response I received was \"perfect.\" 

I never thought I'd slam a restaurant, but I'm actually resentful that we paid $45 each for this dinner.  My partner imagined it could be meal served up in a nursing home and I was left thinking how amazingly good the frozen pizzas I recently discovered from Costco are.  

So sad as it's a beautiful restaurant with a stunning bar."}
{"text":"Small portions of food - teeny flat bread and small Bruschetta - overpriced. Slow service"}
{"text":"Cool concept but the drinks tasted like they use poor ingredients and cheap liquor. Life is way to short to drink cheap liquor!

The food was just okay - nothing spectacular. I would not come back here again.

The server, Jeff,  was plain annoying and mostly a smart@ss. Do not sit in his section!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday to use a coupon for bruschetta that I got at a Yelp event last summer. I really liked the open air set up of the space although there's not much to look at in this part of Chandler.

I'm glad they do the $5 glasses of wine before 6pm. I was in a Spanish mood so I got the grenache and tempranillo. I enjoyed both wines, but I wasn't blown away by them. The bruschetta was ok. The bread is definitely a lesser quality than the bread used at Postino. I didn't enjoy the apple bruschetta as much as I remembered by the first visit, but I loved the olive version! It was so nicely salty and piquant.

Service was decent. Both of our servers were friendly, but one seemed a bit scattered and inexperienced. There was live music, but it was pretty bad I hate to say.

We had a good time, but there was nothing outstanding that would make us return."}
{"text":"Great place to wind down a date night!  Their wine selection is phenomenal and the atmosphere is on point!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself. It was the second time I had gone there and both times the staff was extremely friendly. And the food is great too... I had the hummus platter and the chicken pesto flatbread.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place for breakfast I've ever been. After something early in the morning like church this place is amazing. Eat here"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome wine list selection. Outdoor patio is perfect. La salsa next door is great too!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Good place to hang out and have a couple drinks and appetizers.  Staff was very nice and attentive.  Definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. Great Ambiance and Good Vibes All Around! I Recommend This Place And Will Make My Way Back Soon"}
{"text":"So much better than Armitage!  Service is wonderful and drinks are priced right.  Great happy hour as well.  Patio is wonderful.  I've only had appetizers, but I have been quite pleased.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Very popular and fills up fast on weekends and after 5 PM on weekdays. Great wine selection and sangria. Definitely get a bruschetta board and the pretzel fondue. The sandwiches we have tried were just average, but re aforementioned goodies are amazing! Live music on weekends and a comfortable outdoor seating area that is ...well, like a living room. :-) the Sushi Room next door is owned by the same people and good, too, if you want to make a night of it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Sunday brunch here with my fiancé last weekend. I ordered their breakfast sandwich which came with tiny baked potatoes and he had the eggs Benedict. Not only was the food delicious but they had $12 bottomless mimosas and live music that was very impressive! We were really able to relax and enjoy our Sunday afternoon. The waitresses were super friendly and service was all around great. We can't wait to go back. 

The place is also very intimate at night and a fun place for dates or getting together with friends. I highly recommend trying the smokey bear cocktail if you enjoy unique flavors and something less on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Just left this establishment and possibly is the worst customer service I had in a very long time. Our group of friends came for a round of drinks. We waited for our check for over twenty minutes with just five people in the entire building. It almost seems like the waitress was intentionally walking by the table without acknowledgement. A disappointment since I never have an issue with any other of the locations."}
{"text":"Had a great evening with a very casual feeling and a menu that offers something for everyone. Atmosphere is very relaxing and the staff are very friendly as well as knowledgeable. I had the beef dip which was ok but lacked meat as it was mostly bun which after an hour I was already hungry again. Far better bang for your dollar at Twisted Grove where a beef dip is full of meat. My Bride had the lettuce wraps which were good but lacked a lot of substance where compared to Flo's lettuce wraps hers are amazing in comparison. Still great atmosphere for a get together but lacking substance for the dollar."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. Tables at couches could be little higher to accommodate comfortable eating. Menu is basic food but a bit overpriced. $99 for 2 salads and 3 apps. Good for groups if you prefer the gathering space vs. the food."}
{"text":"Such a cool place.....BUT.  Service is really, really bad.  Messed up our order-twice.  Didn't see anyone for 30 minutes after we ordered...no napkins, no water, no utensils.  Sorry has tons of potential but OMG.  You won't survive with service like that."}
{"text":"Used to go to this place before the name change.  It was okay then and okay now.

Fiancee had the market street margarita.  Good generous pour of Patron but way to much orange juice.  More like a Tequila and orange juice with a hint of margarita.

Tried a few small appetizers.  The shrimp and crab cocktail that came with 4 decent size shrimp but only one small crab claw (??) was okay, as was the caprese salad which most of the tomato was ripe, but would have liked to see a slightly bigger portion and a stronger balsamic reduction.  Again, okay but nothing that would really wow me.

Did enjoy the DJ and the lively atmosphere. Service was attentive as well.   I might be back but use this as a meeting place for a group of friends, grab a cocktail and head out to the next place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my family with 3 children were accosted by another patron as she flipped off our table.  After telling our server he said they were being asked to leave.  Needless to say 30 minutes later we left before them.  I won't go anywhere that doesn't protect their customers from others who have no class and use obscene gestures to get their point across.  The food was good, but they forgot my husbands breakfast and didn't have the courtesy to take it off the bill as it came 10 minutes after everyone was eating.  I'm sad, I thought we found a new neighborhood favorite...alas."}
{"text":"Love this place and happy they are in our neighborhood! I go there both with my hubby or a happy hour with the girls. The service is very good, and they all remember you when you walk in and make a point of coming over to say hi. We mostly go for cocktails , but the food I've tried is quite good as well. Comfortable room with a good vibe! We are regulars !"}
{"text":"Much different from the one in Chandler. I did like the outside space and the waiters. Chef. Bartenders were great! We ordered bruschetta and a shrimp dish. Delicious. Great place for a meet n greet!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails and great service.  I absolutely love prosecco drinks, and the Phoenician did not disappoint.  I was refreshing and fun!  I didn't eat there, but everything looked great.  I'll definitely be back for dinner some night.  The atmosphere is fresh and modern, yet quite intimate...great place for date night or a work get together."}
{"text":"Will not ever go back here, very bad service, and the femail manager is obviously unhappy with her position there because she does not practice customer service. We were personally attacked for not leaving tip of 20% or more to a waitress that was not doing her job!!!!"}
{"text":"The Living Room is a great hangout for Happy Hours or hanging out with friends.  It's really geared for having a drink or two and appetizer (wine bar type) food, although you can get full meals there too.  The service staff is great and we got our drinks and food very quickly.  The food quality is outstanding.  We had bruschetta, and olive plate, and a bavarian pretzel.   Really good!

Note: if you come here during prime-time (630-730 pm) on Friday's and Saturday's it will be packed and you might have to wait for a bit.   Also, don't come here for a quite romantic evening.  It is a pretty small lively place with lots of conversation, laughing, and occasionality people cheering at the TV at the bar.  The bar noise does carry over the the dining area.  On nice nights, we like sitting outside and enjoying the weather (heaters included for the cooler nights).

In any case, this is a great little place to grab some quality wine and food and we go pretty often."}
{"text":"This place is really cute with an attentive waitstaff. The sangria is not worth trying, just a bunch of ice . The charcuterie board is ok. The bruschetta is very big, much bigger than we expected. Overall, I'd recommend this place, just don't even bother with a sangria."}
{"text":"The meat was very over cooked dry and not fresh on the  French dip & sliders the bread was inferior. The French fries were good presentation good. Our server was not trained & not helpful. The atmosphere was clean and appealing. With all the great food in Scottsdale I would not recommend it. However the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and outdoor area!  This is my go-to spot, whether it's for their outstanding happy hour deals or for a nice weekend lunch outside.  I've never had a bad meal here :)"}
{"text":"Neatly tucked away in a sweet cobblestone street shopping area of Chandler, the first impression was a good one: gorgeous patio seating areas with curtains and comfy pillows & dimly lit, nicely decorated indoors. It was almost packed on a Thursday night & had a really great energy (although I was surprised by the pop music playing, didn't give the right vibe). 

We were seated on the patio (mind you, it was 110 degrees that day) & the misters/fans made it comfortably cool. It didn't take long to be brought water & have our orders taken. Chris was our server & he was absolutely FABULOUS! Gave us a wonderful overview of the wine selections, his recommendations, & what would pair well with it in - his suggestions were spot on. We ordered a cheese platter. I adored the brie cheese with my riesling ste. michelle wine!

The evening was absolutely perfect! And to cap it off, when the waiter heard it was my birthday, out came a DELICIOUS cookie cake free of charge. Wonderful place, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food awesome service. If you just want to chill and have fun this is the place. I can't put my finger on it. Is it the decor,  the live music the food or the staff that I always have a great time when I am here and leave feeling awesome.  Oh wait I know it is the awesome fries. No kidding they have  awesome fries on the menu and they are seriously LEGIT"}
{"text":"Great Saturday brunch on the patio.  Dog friendly, fantastic views, good background music, service is terrific and the meals were all a+.  Check it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for happy hour and general lounging around! Definitely my new favorite place for myself and to bring out of town guests. DC Ranch is already a gorgeous location, and the Living Room's outdoor patio takes it up a notch. The ambiance is exactly what you want on an afternoon with beautiful surroundings, a few drinks, yummy appetizers, and relaxing music in the background. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"the scenery is great here.  drink specials aren't bad either.  The only thing missing is having food on happy hour."}
{"text":"Ok...food was good. Priced typical Scottsdale over priced. Service was meh...forgot our oysters and everything took a longggggg time...wasn't even a full house."}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer who wished she could write two reviews for this place, but over all I love it. Just don't try it on a Friday or Saturday night unless you're under 30. Too crowded; too loud; too many pheromones, but on to the positive.

This place has a helpful and knowledgeable staff, a very decent wine list and a respectable beer list. I can't believe the generosity of happy hour which goes from 11am to 6pm. That's a dang long happy hour! $5 glasses of wine and $2.50 draft beers including my personal fave Kiltlifter. Those are great prices. 

This great spot is under the same ownership as The Sushi Room next door, and if you ask nicely they will bring you a sushi roll while you have your happy hour beverage. That is \"above-and-beyond\" service in my book. Most of the waitstaff is quite young and of the short-shorts and low cut top variety, but personable even to old gals like me and the service (other than F&S nights) is great. 

The menu choices are not extensive, but they are good. Excellent salads, soups and sandwiches. The Caprese sandwich is spectacular as is the Caprese appetizer. Fresh and delish. 

Sitting outside in the afternoon on the covered patio areas is a treat. Bring a book, sip a glass, have a nosh. Life is good in the Living Room."}
{"text":"Good relaxed environment, food is good, drinks are quaffable. After dinner rush, the crowd is late 20's to mid 30's. Great place to have an drink and a conversation. Only reason I have it 3 stars is because drinks are priced as premium but don't reflect the quality. Example I ordered a whiskey sour and got margarita mix and bourbon that was around $8. Had I know I would have stuck to the beer."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this was the first time for all 6 of us to have bubbles n brunch here. The place is beautiful and had a great atmosphere. I would have given 5 stars if the service was better. Food was good. But every time we needed something we had to look for her and call her over. Plus 2 of us ordered crepes, we had no idea we were able to get anything off the bar behind us that comes with your when ordering crepes. Fruit potatoes etc. all n all we had a good time but the service sucked!"}
{"text":"Every year at the end of the school year my division from Chandler-Gilbert Community College go out for lunch.  There are usually 14-16 of us and it is often times hard to find a place that will take reservations to accommodate us.  My first pint of contact was Travis, I shared that I was calling around to check with a few places.  He's was super helpful and kind, even said he looked forward to hearing back from me when we decided to make reservations.  I was impressed with his care.  I called back vet shortly after, he remembered my name and what I needed.  He was more than happy to accommodate our needs.  Fast forward to today when we came in for lunch, the place was lovely, the service was excellent considering the size of the group, and all were very pleased with their meals.  The salads were crisp and fresh, and the Prime Rib Sliders were to die for!  I can't wait to bring my husband for a visit!  Well done!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out this time and really enjoyed the Patty Melts...they were done perfectly and they were nice and freshly warm when they arrived home...I would certainly say the service is  excellent  as well as the food."}
{"text":"A comfortable place to happy hour and enjoy a cocktail.   The manager Trevor handled our reservation expertly after an obnoxious group refused to move from our spot.  He made arrangements for us in a similar location and made certain we were accommodated.  Good drinks, excellent service and a nice environment will take me back here again."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for The Living Room. Places like this are hard to find in South Chandler. Very welcome change from the monotony of chain establishments in the area. Don't come here expecting authentic Bruschetta. The bread is much thicker cut, and does not have the flavor of a toasted french bread. If you can put that aside, the toppings are excellent. I had the proscuitto and brie pressed sandwich, an interesting synthesis of French and Italian staples. 

Overall the ambiance of The Living Room is what adds to the charm. Even on an early summer evening, sitting out on the patio is a great way to relax and catch up with your co-diners."}
{"text":"The food was just alright. The service is horrible. The waitresses walked past us several times with us trying to make eye contact before we got a menu. Same at the end for a check.  I really like the place but the service is so bad I'll never return."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday around 1. The live singer was great, just a little too loud. Awesome ambiance. Food was really good. Service was mediocre. Drinks were reasonable."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  We went to check it out, we sat at one end of the bar where it looks like a large communal table.  We had a margarita and a blueberry lemon drop.  Yuck, their well liquor must be the worst I have ever had. I imagine that is what gasoline would taste like.  We could not finish those drinks.  We decided to cut our loses and leave."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience at this restaurant. They have absolutely delicious sangria and to die for French fries! The food is all very good, delicious bruschetta, and flat bread pizzas. The service was great and the staff was attentive to your needs but didn't feel like they are hovering over you. 

My absolute favorite thing, they have blankets available for the guests sitting outdoors. I would recommend this for a big party or for an intimate setting! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Orchard bruschetta is amazing!!! I loved the blend of apples, Brie, fig jam, and agave nectar... Korean steak lettuce cups were good, too."}
{"text":"Great place: Comfortable, relaxed, and great customer service with management actively engaged. Very clean including windows, bathrooms, and patio. Live music on Sunday's and a misting system for the patio that is on all the time."}
{"text":"Went for their soft opening on Sunday. They were to open on Monday. It was great!
I had the Salmon with couscous .I asked to have the Salmon done medium, since most places make their fish well done,It came out perfect.My husband had the Steak Frites and enjoyed it as well.
Carter was our waiter and was knowledgable about the wine list.
If they were this good during the soft opening imagine what they will do when they have been up and running for a few weeks."}
{"text":"Good happy hour for drink specials; the food all around is just mediocre. The fries were a very generous serving. Steak lettuce cups are good (3). $5 red and white sangria! Very nice ambiance. They also do a brunch (which I haven't had yet) and during the Phoenix Open they have shuttles to the event."}
{"text":"Have been here several times with my co-workers and friends at lunch. This place is good but not great. I appreciate the atmosphere and decor but the food on it's own isn't memorable and the prices are higher than you would expect. If it was up to me, I would always go next door to Sauce where the food tastes better, service is quicker, and the prices are cheaper. I do like the Cheese Fondue appetizer but it's over-priced at $9.95. Something else I'm not crazy about is all of their sandwiches are served with only two side options: organic chips or cottage cheese. Seriously, cottage cheese? So I get the chips every time and they are just okay and I leave thinking, \"lunch was just okay\" today. If it wasn't for my friends who love it I really wouldn't ever go there again. One plus I'll give to them is they give a 10% discount if you work at one of the tech companies nearby."}
{"text":"My wife and I were waiting to sit and was told to wait, after waiting for 30 min and being walked to 3 different tables and them giving it to someone else right in front of us they told us it was first come first seating. Terrible way to treat a customer, I will never come here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the hottest wine bars in Chandler! Great food, great service and a lot of fun. They have a terrific menu but don't come for dinner as they don't serve, it's perfect following dinner or before. Awesome apps!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. I absolutely love sitting on the patio in the smoothly chairs, relaxing, drinking wine, and eating good food. Everything I've ordered there has been very tasty. The service has been great every time and they are dog friendly. I definitely recommend them for a laid back, enjoyable kind of night. Great for dates and girl time get togethers."}
{"text":"Great Place!  I went there with my girlfriend for lunch.  The place was fairly empty, so we had pretty much choice of seating.  Also, it is open seating. 

We got a small table and ordered the 4 types of Bruschetta.  Overall, very, very good.  Good (not great) service.  

We got this pizza cookie thing for dessert.  It was very good.  It would have been nice if the server had mentioned the pan was 450 degrees, so as to not touch it.  Also, a circular pan does not fit on an oval plate.  We ended up putting it on the table.  Small things, yes...but things that keep you from 5 stars in my book.

Very nice place. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great relaxing wine bar with excellent food. Come early and grab a sofa set. The prime rib sliders are to die for. The selection of Bruschetta runs to six   I've been told that one should not miss the Bang Bang Shrimp.  Incredible choice of drinks and liquor; very good wine selection. So now that I have told you all go to a different location please

One big issue -the music. It was pleasant when we arrived - but then the DJ arrived and music became NOISE - we couldn't talk among ourselves  So go early for the good and ambiance."}
{"text":"I am surprised how this hidden bar in \"downtown Ocotillo\" is absolutely never empty. The decor is simple, the ambiance is nice and the general atmosphere is swanky and upscale. Read: my 20-something year old friends would never pay for the stuff here.

But- their happy hour, though 11-6pm (seriously who stops happy hour at 6pm?) is pretty decent and worth checking out when in the area. Its location is the greatest blessing AND curse: if you work in OC, its a great bar at almost-walking distance, but SINCE you work in OC, you're likely to bump into coworkers and managers from your office... often sipping on cocktails with ladies other than their wives.

Oh dear.. look away, pretend you never saw each other.

Social awkwardness aside, I have been pretty pleased by the accommodations at The Living Room. When I organized a 20+ people happy hour here, they were able to reserve the community table for me and extend the happy hour until 7pm (not a hard bargain for them). Our server was suuuuuper slow, which although understandable for the crazy packed venue, was still quite annoying. 

Their cocktails are a tad pricey but decently put together and tasty. Out of their food, probably the best thing on the damn menu is the caprese dish: fresh mozzarella served with pesto, cherry tomatoes, aged balsamic reduction and toasted bread - super simple, incredibly delicious. Their bruschettas were tasty but nothing to yell about: the roasted red pepper hummus was standard (hummus and bread, we've all tried it) and the olive tapenade was a bit better, but nothing you can't make at home. Their pinwheel rolls were A-OK but the cider vinaigrette was beyond terrible and did not go well with the tortilla bread and sandwich contents. yuk. Finally, their fondue is simple and nice (at $10) but I think the ratio of dipping items to cheese was a little off. Read: we need more cheese. More cheese!!

A solid 4 stars after multiple visits. I think you can have a great evening if you come here for drinks and make educated menu decisions (not everything is going to be tasty, but that will happen everywhere you go). Its a 5 stars in atmosphere, 2 in speed of service and a 3 in food... Yeah, i'm terribly picky."}
{"text":"Fun place to meet friends for drinks, small bites, cheese platter, etc. Good happy hour, nice outdoor patio, good staff. Just a fun overall place to meet old friends or make new ones."}
{"text":"Pros: Nice little out side seating area if the weather is right.

Cons: Complete lack of manners 
 

Other: Food and wine are ok. 


I went here with a friend of mine on a Friday around 5:30pm. Initially everything was fine. The food was ok, the wine was good, and the server was good. It gets a bit crowded on a Friday after work so it's a little loud and can be hard to find seating. 

In the middle of our meal the manager or the owner (tall, thin, silver haired gentleman in his 50s?) comes over to our table and grabs the chair my (large very noticeable) purse was placed in, leaving me with no choice but to quickly snatch my purse before he takes it with him to another table. I looked at my friend in shock like \"What?\" as a group of guys at  the next table over look at me with shock on their faces. Clearly we were all thinking the same thing \"What the hell? Did he really just do that?\". I left there with little enthusiasm about the place. 

The second time I went back was again on a week day, around the same time. The place wasn't busy just yet and I was quickly seated at a table. I sipped on a glass of wine, waiting a couple minutes for my friend. The place started to fill in a bit and I was then informed that I would be moving to a different table so they could accomodate a larger party. Rather than move, I decided to leave.

What is it with this place and their lack of manners? What ever happened to ASKING someone if they would mind if you took the chair or if they would mind moving to a different table? I would have absolutely said yes to both of these request and not be posting a 1 star review.

I don't believe in rewarding bad behavior so I won't be revisting nor will I be recommending this place."}
{"text":"This wine bar is poppin. Mikey is a really good server. He will take care of you. I don't like the food as much as the drinks though. On Saturday and Sunday there are $5 mimosas and $5 Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time a few weeks back on and I love it! My bf is a regular and suggested we go on a Sunday because of the live music and happy hour specials. Loved the look, loved the laidback feel, the live music was beautiful and chill and I loved the covers she played! Had some a slab of bruschetta, which you can never go wrong on with a cold drink! Got the following:
* Roasted Peppers, Goat Cheese, Garlic, Tomato Jam

* Apples, Brie, Fig Jam, Honey and Agave Nectar

* Prosciutto, Figs, Mascarpone Cheese, Pepper Jam

Yum and yum. Another place I can't wait to go back to, especially when the whether cools down and I can hang out on the patio!"}
{"text":"I'm wondering if The Living Room is transitioning to a self service restaurant? I get it, sometimes the Stars deliver a most eminent ass whooping upon servers who are just trying to keep it together. Sadly, that's not the case with The Living Room. I've been in 3 seperate times recently, all of which the restaurant was seemingly empty. Yet, the servers (whom I can only assume are named Regina, Gretchen, and Karen) couldn't find time between gossiping to get to our tables. After attempting to give this place \"one more try\"... 3 times, I (and most likely many others) will never again get my hopes up only to be met by the cold, boney shoulders of their unimpressed waitresses. Waitresses who look down upon my money and I and think \"you can't sit with us\". 

I feel genuinely sorry for the owners who have, simultaneously, created such a beautiful atmosphere - and seriously horrible staff. One which could easily put them out of business."}
{"text":"* good service
* good food
* decent prices (we missed happy hour)
* nice atmosphere. It seems pretentious, but it's not."}
{"text":"Looking for new places to go in Scottsdale and found the Living Room. 
I stopped in for a glass of wine, which was good. Bartender was a nice guy.
Would have ordered food, but was distracted by the poor management. These people are completely oblivious to the fact that they're working and no one seems to have control. It's like a college bar.
One guy, in a short sleeve gray polo shirt, seemed to be some kind of manager, but was throwing back glasses of beer like a customer and spent the whole time on his phone or socializing with employees who could have been focusing on customers.
It looks like a really good place, but it just feels cheap. Too many options to make this a go-to.
I think John Taffer would have a field day here."}
{"text":"While it has a great atmosphere, I was disappointed the food.  We ordered two appetizers, the spinach / artichoke dip and the hummus dip.  The spinach dip was very greasy/oily like it had been sitting out for a few days and simply reheated.  While it tasted ok, I would not order it again.  The tortilla chips that were served with it were cold and stale.  The hummus dip was very bland.  It was served with cauliflower, cucumber and pita bread.  The pita bread was stale, while the cauliflower was obviously old because there were brown spots that had to be cut off before eating.   While service was fine, they never smiled or showed any personality.  I had heard a lot about it, but was disappointed and would not eat there again."}
{"text":"The Living room has really gone down hill. I frequented this establishment for several years and when it first opened it was a delightful little wine bar with great service and wonderful food. Now the food is mediocre and the service is incredibly lax. I'll probably still visit if I'm in the area but I wish the management would take notice because I'm really rooting for this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Bang Bang shrimp!! Their prime rib sliders are amazing!! Great wine list!! Shared a bottle of Justin Isosceles!! Fantastic outdoor seating!!"}
{"text":"Love their flatbreads and salads!! The donut holes are amazing!! Soo much fun to inject with Bavarian Cream and Chocolate!!
Maybe you could ADD salted Carmel as an injectable !!
Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant/bars in the area. Great food, great atmosphere, great service. I particularly like the outdoor seating. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I can vouch for the bruschetta (there are about six different kinds, all great), the Thai and Korean lettuce wraps, prime rib sliders, awesome fries, and flatbread pizzas. Nice drinks menu as well, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The service is fair to good (more toward fair), but the ambiance and cute, unique menu options make this place a keeper.  Try to avoid going when they're busy because the place is small and it can be tough to find a place to sit plus it gets quite loud.  Prices are decent for what you get.  Don't get the skinny drinks - they're terrible.  Either drink club soda or stick to just one of the real thing."}
{"text":"The menu looked great, but the final product was less than stellar. Two of the people in my party had to send back their food and I noticed tables around us doing the same. For some reason there's no server assigned to individual tables - they all share. This is great in theory, but terrible in execution. They would all come up and ask the same question one right after the other. Can only say \"we already ordered\", so many times before it becomes annoying. We had to ask for water multiple times. They spilled cream on our table and didn't clean it. The list could go on. The only saving grace was the atmosphere and the donut holes. I'd avoid this place till they get their stuff figured out."}
{"text":"Flatbread pep was good, but I didn't like how they made me feel like I was putting them out even though it was a good 45 min before closing.  Get a similar vibe with way better food, service, and wine at vintage 95 which is very close in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"The Living Room is my kind of place!  The dark setting, candles, open space, the vibe, the crowd.....am I still in Chandler?  Where did these people come from?  

A friend and I went on Friday at around 7pm and the place was packed.  There was some confusion at the door, since there's not a \"hostess stand\" indicating that you are to wait to be seated.  We were seated within 15 minutes.  Immediately, we noticed the music was just a tad too loud.  I loved the mix, but yes, a tad too loud.  

We started with the bruschetta, which was delicious!  Plenty as a starter for two.  I had the mixed greens salad and it was just that....mixed greens.  Kind of boring but the greens were fresh and the dressing was light.  My friend had the chicken salad sandwich and butternut squash soup, and while she raved about the soup she was less than impressed with the sandwich.  

All in all, I definitely want to come back and enjoy happy hour since this is close to home for me.  What a great new addition to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to go to a happy hour.  Went on Yelp and searched for \"Best Happy Hour in Scottsdale\" and the living room came up.  Had never heard of if and we  were in the mood for something new so we gave it a shot.  We really liked the service, thought the restaurant was comfortable and inviting.  We thought that the Happy Hour food menu was anemic compared to other happy hour's we go to.  We ordered the caprese salad off the happy hour menu and thought it was great.  Not finding anything else on the happy hour menu that we were interested in we ordered the meat/cheese board off the regular menu.  We were beyond disappointed.  For the price we thought the portions were vary small, and some of the items did not taste very fresh. We may give it another shot at some point because it seems like a fun place to go but we will not be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"The place is nice, lots of energy, and good service.  One of the best wine bars in the east valley for sure.  The service can be less than perfect when they are slammed, but otherwise, the place is awesome!

The atmosphere, wine, and food will keep us coming back for sure, especially for their super fun Happy Hours."}
{"text":"Modern & fun environment. We did a couple wine flights- great food & wine tasting.  Service & food was great!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Hummus had fermented and when we let the spacy waitress know she looked utterly confused. Service is slow even during non-busy hours. Field green salad was decent but while eating on the patio area we were forced to inhale the smoke of a patron who was standing just on the other side. Not my favorite place."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Gainey Village neighborhood!  We decided to stop in for appetizers and drinks one Sunday evening while I was picking something up at my nearby office.  The patio is pet friendly (bonus),  service was great, and the selections were extensive too.  I thoroughly enjoyed a glass of albarino and the queso dip with tortillas.  Perfect way to wind down the weekend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at the Living Room on a Saturday night about 8pm for a quick date night out.  The atmosphere at least at that time of night was more like a club with a energetic atmosphere then a wine bar or lounge. The crowd was mixed but as the night got later more 20-30's dressed nicely.   I liked the vibe and the music but it was dark and loud and would not be a great place if you were wanting to take a first date or chat with friends or partner at your table.  I did like the layout of the tables and couches and stylish décor. The prices were a bit high and the portions were a bit stingy.  Menu had some similarities to Prostinos.  The service and friendliness of staff was average.  I would not go here for  dinner as I think there are better options but would suggest for small plates and a glass of wine with a fun vibe.  We will try again for happy hour on a less crowded night."}
{"text":"Olives as good as Il Postino, Garlic Fries better than Gordon Biersch, a proper Moscow Mule (thank you!) I'll try more food next time but I'll become a regular since they had the good sense to hire House of Stairs as a regular band on Saturday nights from 8-11. Bring friends if you come as introducing you friends to Holly Pyle will up your cool factor.

Garlic Aioli that comes with the fries is BOMB!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every item on the menu is perfectly executed and the service is exceptional. Definitely a standout place from the rest of chandlers bar scene"}
{"text":"I've been there for Happy Hour twice, it looks cool from the outside but it's REALLY loud! The music is bad too.  The food and drinks are good. Definately not an intimate date place. : ( i had higher hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere wonderful staff.  Best thing on menu is pine in sliders just ask for gorgonzola on the side it's overpowers. Brunch is great too"}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with my experience at The Living Room in Chandler tonight. The food was alright and the service was extremely poor. There were multiple waiters and waitresses that would come by but took 10-15 minutes to just order drinks and another 15 minutes before they took our food order. There was no silverware on the table and once we received our food we had to ask for napkins and silverware. There were 5 of us and only gave us 2 sets! So we asked again and no one ever came back. Finally, once we were done eating another waitress came by to ask how things were, still with no silverware and no refills on drinks. She came back with the little cocktail napkins you use for your drinks. Anything you asked for wouldn't get done or was messed up because there was no one waiter/waitress per table and no communication. I will not be back and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"When my wife and I found ourselves in downtown Chandler around lunchtime last weekend, we had to give this place a try.  My 90 year-old grandmother recommended it to us so we weren't sure what to expect.

It was a Sunday and the entire downtown area was pretty dead including this place.  This was good because I hate busy places.  The entire place has a great vibe to it which I loved.  It really does remind me of a super chill \"living room\".  The weather was perfect so they had all their garage-door walls opened.  We chose some comfy chairs and started with a white and a red sangria.  They were both good but you could tell they weren't homemade.  We then split some bruschetta which was excellent.  My only complaint is that the bread wasn't toasted (or not toasted enough) and was cut into 3 slices.  I don't understand why places can't cut their bruschetta into 4 pieces because 3 makes it difficult to properly share.  We then split the veggie salad and a chicken salad sandwich and they too were excellent and very tasty.

All of their salads, sandwiches and bruschettas all look excellent and I'd like to try every one.  Our waitress was extremely nice and I would return to the place anytime if it were 30 mins closer to my house.

The only other bummer was that this place is on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and I could have gotten a certificate for a couple bucks if I had known in advance I was going."}
{"text":"This was a great place for Happy Hour! My girlfriend and I met up here and hung out for a few hours. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy with indoor and outdoor seating. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'll give it a 3, simply because it is a nice spot with a good ambience. However, this is easily one of the most overhyped and overpriced spots I've gone to in Chandler. I've been here atleast a handful of times and every time I find myself asking why I came back. Don't ever arrive super hungry, as it will be atleast 35 minutes to get even just an appetizer. I can't justify why a bowl of olives would take 35 minutes! The food is simply not worth what it costs and portions are very small. Next time I'll stick to Postino's."}
{"text":"The Living Room is pretty good, especially for a restaurant in Chandler. The Sangria isn't great but it's decent. The prime rib sliders are very good, except when the kitchen over cooks the buns.

The wait staff is very laid back and friendly, the crowd is usually an interesting mix of people.

Bottom line: good for happy hour, grab a drink and a bite..."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place because they advertised a free birthday dinner for those one in the month of November.....I was a little under dressed for this upscale spacious restaurant but, it was a Monday night after 8pm and there we're two other gentleman at the bar....so it didn't matter.  Sitting at the bar I ordered an IPA beer and choose the Angus burger from their menu. When the food came to the bar...at first it didn't look like much from plate....but I do have to say the burger was big and filling! The food was great but if I didn't have that free meal coupon it Definitely would've been slightly overpriced.....all in all...I'm pleased!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the service.  The servers are real friendly and welcoming.  I have to recommend the \"awesome fries,\" (they're actually just called awesome fries), but be mindful - they've got a little kick. I'd have to say these are the best fries I've had in quite some time.  I would also recommend the flat bread and their cheese and meat plate."}
{"text":"What a great name, awesome energy and amazing staff.  Now let me preface this with I live in North Scottsdale, so as many Arizonians know, we are stuck in a bubble up here.  That being said, since I have only been here 2 years, I have never driven so far south.  I thought i was in Tuscon.  I had no idea there were two 202 freeways..... you, I drove to the furthest one. But the drive, and getting lost was worth the wait to dine in this great place. Let start with the Skinny Cocktail list.... yes skinny.  Everything was low in sugar or had none and all bursting with flavor.  I loved it!
We moved in to the Cheese Board which came with crusty bread, almonds and fruit. We also ordered the Bavarian Pretzel, with warm brie, and three mustard's.   I love mustard more than anything! 
This fine establishment had awesome service, we sat at the bar and could not think of one bad aspect, except the old guy in a V-Neck Affliction shirt, but maybe he drove in from Scottsdale too."}
{"text":"On a day when it is 115 outside, it was cool inside the restaurant. That was a good thing. 

So sorry but our lunch experience was not great by any means. Had a high-top (reserved) table for 6 guests. Three guests arrived and had water and menu's when the rest of us arrived. The \"server\" approached one of the latter guests and asked if she wanted something other than water, but didn't ask the other two; she turned and walked away.  

When she returned we were able to order our lunch items and drinks, but her attitude reflected an annoyance. Food was good, not great, but that wasn't the big issue. There is just not a connection with the staff, server, anyone in the restaurant. When we all got up to leave, she (nor anyone else) didn't say thanks, come again, have a nice, good-bye. Totally ignored. Even the table next to us was complaining. 

As the service is so poor, and we all consider dining a complete experience, I won't go back or recommend unless I hear it's improved."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people rate this place a low star rating. I have been here a couple times and I'm beyond impressed with the service and the ambience is awesome. 

So I came here a few months ago and Tony remembered me, our conversation, and even what he served me. I mean how on earth does someone know that? So he sat me at the bar and we chatted it up and was super helpful. I asked where the oysters came from and he took time to check and didn't say I don't know and gave me a real answer. Same with the vintage of my wine I got. 

I got the queso and Margarita flatbread tonight along with 2 oysters. Something simple not too heavy it was good. The chips were great and the candle below the queso kept it warm and flowing. I liked the cocktail sauce the oysters came with. 

Tony and Hannah were helping me. Both super happy, friendly, and smiling the whole time. It's how it should be. Patrons spending money and choosing their money to go here and they delivered on the service. 

I like the overall ambience here. It is my style. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What  a fun place...had out of town guests and I knew they would love food and ambience as much as we always do..sure enough our waitress Amanda M made the nite one to remember!!
great location---great food ---and especially great service..A true win, win, win!!!   Bob P."}
{"text":"Went there with some friends, was immediately greeted by two rude workers, which prompted two women in our group to be rude back. We seated ourselves and were waiting for service. The manager arrived and said we had to leave, I ask the manager what was wrong why couldn't we receive service, no answer, which sparked a large argument with the two women in our group and three workers which carried over to the parking lot. I personally felt profiled do not recommend this place at all. Never felt so embarrased in my life"}
{"text":"Was there on Sunday. Carter was our server and he was great! Live music was very good as well and NOT to loud as stated in some of your past reviews! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and it was very good. Definitely would return. I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, a VERY large portion though, enough for two. Had spring mix greens with a champagne vinaigrette dressing, seared ahi tuna and garnished with avocado and mango's ($11.95). Also had the bruschetta which was great. The bread was very soft with a crispy crust. Tried the red pepper with prosciutto and fig and also the prime rib with Gorgonzola cheese and horseradish. Both were very pleasant but the prime rib bruschetta really needed more horseradish, the taste was very faint almost nonexistent. They have a great happy hour menu also for their drinks, but I did not sample. Waiter (Brent) was very nice and had a great sense of humor. There were not many parties in there, only a few other tables were occupied. Very nice atmosphere, quaint yet modern with small tables and also lounge chairs...like you were in a \"living room.\" Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend to try out their exclusive vegan menu. The avocado frites were yummy! We also ordered the mini cupcake Shepherd's pie. The taste was quite good but the paper from the cup actually came off when we scooped up the lentils from the cup and we ate some paper..Yuck.. I would give it 3&1/2 star because of that. It seems someone must have used the wrong cup for serving this warm dish or there is a major error in design of the dish. For the main we had the zucchini and carrot spaghetti. The Veg pasta ( not real pasta) was refreshing and the marinara sauce was really good. We used it to dip our bread..we also ordered the crusted tempeh steak and I really like the texture of crusted tempeh and sweet potato mash. For dessert we had the Vegan Petit Fours..the beet chocolate cupcake was a little on the dry end but the other ones were quite good including the butter pistachio chocolate orange and coconut raspberry cashew almond. 
We came here on a Tuesday night and it was very quiet. The decor of the restaurant was very classy and pretty. They decorated the walls with original print art and paintings from..the room is furnished with oversized chesterfields with colorful and comfortable cushions and the British influenced checkers tablecloths. We were told by our friendly server that they just got a new chef so we will definitely come back to try other dishes and desserts. Prices are quite reasonable. Tip included we spent about $90. We didn't drink any alcohol but apparently they have a huge wine and beer/ draft selection. They also serve a huge variety of loose-leaf teas (probably supplied by the Tea Room next door) !! Can't wait to try the afternoon tea menu or twilight tea menu at the Tea Room."}
{"text":"The first time I tried to call and set a reservation they told me that they only took reservations for parties of 8+, I said great, we've got a party of ten. I was then put on hold, when I was taken off I was informed that they were booked and I should just try walking in at 8pm on a Saturday night because there would only be a 15-20 minute wait... We called back the next day and got our reservation taken care of. 

The server was completely overwhelmed. She would take one drink order at a time. It was actually funny because she would leave while we were in the middle of ordering. The cocktails did not taste like they had any alcohol. Our orders were completely messed up and all of our appetizers came out at very different times. 

One of the managers took care of the situation and ended up serving our table. It was just not the greatest experience, especially when we were there celebrating a birthday."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. No true Happy Hour on the weekends. If you order the sangria, you get a glass filled with ice and two maraschino cherries. The food is mediocre at best. 

Wanted to try something different than Postinos and the joke was on me. 


If you frequent Maya in Old Town you'll like this place but otherwise avoid it."}
{"text":"New to the area. Me and my mom walked in on a slow weekday afternoon. No greeting from anyone. After seating ourselves and waiting for any sign of acknowledgment I found some menus at the empty host stand and our flustered waiter finally came over and asked \"What can I get you to drink?\" My mom explained that we had never been before and asked \"What is your happy hour?\" He said \"It's a happy hour.\" I thought that would have been a great opportunity to welcome us and tell us about the restaurant and the concept, etc. I asked if there was any special pricing for appetizers and he said no, which I don't think is true. Mom ordered a beer and I asked for water. Another server finally brought the beer in a bottle, no glass. Just seems a little tacky for a nice place. After some neglect we told the other server that we would be eating someplace else and would need the check. We watched her relay the message and after our server threw his hands up in the air in exasperation, came over and asked if we were ready to order food! I was thinking, yeah right cranky pants. Oh well, I know people have bad days, but after reading other people's bad service stories, I knew it wasn't an isolated incident. We left our cash and beer on the table and left."}
{"text":"Pretty hip place. Good selection of beers on tap and lots of cocktails and wine. Really the ambiance does it for this plAce. Didn't try the food."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a glass of wine and appetizers with your girlfriends. My girlfriends and I went there to celebrate one of our birthdays. We sat on the patio by the fireplace. Our waitress was awesome she let us try as many samples of wines that wanted to. The wines are very good and pretty inexpensive. As for the appetizers they were just ok. The bruschetta is good, but the spinach artichoke dip was tasteless. This place stands out for its ambiance, great tasting wine and good service!"}
{"text":"We've been here 2x now. Both times the service was great and the food very good. The flat breads are $9 and are high quality with great flavor. We had the sausage one both times and it was one of the best flat breads we've had anywhere. Thin cracker like crispy crust and nice sized pieces of sausage. They serve it with a sprig of fresh oregano,  nice touch and really boosts the flavor. We also tried the brie fondu and the marinated olives. Both were great and very wine friendly. Wine prices are very fair especially when you buy the bottle. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour and we weren't disappointed. Great selection of spirits, beer and wine. I went with the white sangria it was perfect to sip on while lounging on the patio.  Great choice of delicious appetizers,  we had the pretzel,  queso and awesome fries, all were tasty. Service was great thanks Tanner!"}
{"text":"I've gone here for Happy Hour twice with my coworkers on Thursday afternoons/early evenings. The setting is super-comfortable and is a great place to unwind with a glass of wine or beer (which is half price during happy hour! great deal). 

I highly recommend the apple and honey bruschetta. It was heavenly!

They were playing Frank Sinatra and other \"older\" music at a low volume both times I was there. It was nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Like a previous reviewer stated, this place was a pleasant surprise. Open entering I was greeted with the biggest and warmest smile ever and told to have a seat wherever I wanted so I opted for the cozy couch as I waited for my gorgeous friend Jody to arrive so that we could gossip about life! Our lovely waiter Michael was great and our cheese and meat board, paired with the potato chips (don't judge me)  and the bottle of Meiomi made our night of catching up even better. Next time I am here, I will have to have dinner and sit outside (once it is a little warmer of course) but I do know that I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is where its at! For drinks, snacks, and a cozy atmosphere. 

We were there on a Monday, which happened to be ladies night. I didn't partake, but gals can get a manicure and cocktail for just $14. I'll definitely be trying that sometime in the future. There are drink specials on skinny cocktails, beer and wine all night for the girls. 

The best part was the live music. Cameron Degurski was awesome. He performed acoustic versions of everything from The Beatles to C-Lo Green, it was a perfect addition to the cozy setting. I hope he is a regular there.

Overall, this place has the best atmosphere. Comfy couches and dark wood, with an indoor-outdoor feel. This is the perfect place for drinks and snacks and relaxing, though I wouldn't go here for dinner. The food is great, but more small plates and sandwiches than actual meals, which is fitting for the lounge-type setup. Try the cheese fondue! We completely skipped the nice little fondue forks and just dunked the assorted breads and veggies straight into the cheese. It was too good for proper etiquette.

This place is the best of its breed here in Chandler."}
{"text":"We like to go hear our favorite local artist - Cameron DeGurski.  On June 4 - 2017 - he was at the Livingroom Wine Cafe.  We were just going to have a couple of refreshments while we listened.  As soon as we told friends - we ended up with a group of about 10 - with a great seating option at the bar - so we could talk to each other and still enjoy Cameron's music.  one drink turned into several, with the Pick 4 Bruschetta and the Awesome Fries to snack on.  We were planning to go home and grill after.  Nope - the food completely filled us up.  The Italian and Chop versions of the bruschetta were our favorite... and they didn't skimp at all on the fries.  Come hungry, come thirsty... and watch for when Cameron returns... well worth the drive.  

The location is great - cool furnishings - chandeliers, couches, easy chairs.  Just like home!"}
{"text":"Very, very slow, and unfriendly service.  Food was okay.  Decent drink list.  You're better off going to Postino."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch! Awesome Bloody Mary Bar! Super friendly service and amazing decor! 1 of my neighborhood favs!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place since the reviews here aren't stellar... But I didn't want cheap summerlicious dinner and I didn't want a big crowd so I came here. Totally satisfied with the food, service, ambiance that I am leaving a review for a Toronto establishment for the first time... We ordered the fish, rib eye and pork chops - basically everything except for the vegan option - and totally impressed with the quality of the food. Great portions and not too salty! The service was top top notch. We did order oysters apart from the summerlicious menu and it was very fresh but super tiny! Overall the living room isn't a modern, cool place but it's quiet, beautifully decorated and more of an old school quality feel to the place... After all it is the Windsor arms. Take a date or a family for dinner!"}
{"text":"Some wine lounges totally lack a food or nice cocktail selection but not this place!  Although we were not impressed with the bruschetta we were impressed with their cocktails and salads! Plus it was nice they had an open type design which made lounging in chairs or sitting at a table a comfortable laid back setting.  I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Olives, fondue, pretzels, prime rib sliders, bruschetta, sangria. It all tasted like delicious."}
{"text":"This is a \"halfway\" review because we didn't order any food at the Livng Room and will never go there to eat. My husband and i stopped in on a Sunday evening. It was monsoonyish out so there was no one seated outside but the inside was busy. The bar was full and the tables in the main food area were almost full. We had fun. It was a great place to people watch. The music was excellent. A female singer. But in watching people we noticed that the service in the restaurant was horrible. There was one waitress that we were enthralled by because she looked like she was about to kill herself and moved like a snail. We watched her try to smile at a customer and it was... well.. sad. Our server was the only server in the bar. She was literally running and it was still slow. There were two servers in the food area and they were both really slow moving. the one who didn't look like she wanted to kill herself sure did't appear enthused. And the wine by the glass list is just \"okay\". Nothing interesting on it. Just some basic mid range wines. This is a good happy hour place. Somewhere to get drinks, watch single people (or married ones who wanna be), have some laughs. But it doenst look like a dinner place."}
{"text":"I would recommend his place if you weren't too concerned about having conversation with your meal. I thought the food was really great.  We went for happy hour and had the bruschetta, lettuce wraps and shrimp appetizer and all were very good. They don't have an actual happy hour menu, just discounts on drinks. All of our severs were excellent. The idea of a living room decor is cute, but we probably won't frequent much unless we sit outside (not a good idea in Arizona's summer heat). It was just too noisy inside for us. Having said that, we are In our 60's, and can remember our parents saying the same kind of thing. So the younger crowd shouldn't have any problem with it. I would say go and check it out!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's perfect for date night and has an amazing wine list! I love the ambience and the wonderful patio. It definitely stands out from the other places in this area. I've only tried the food once and it was sort of lacking but the presentation was lovely."}
{"text":"This place is a great concept. Live music (guy playing the guitar and singing), dog friendly patio, open floor plan, vibrant colors, delicious food and super friendly, great staff!!"}
{"text":"First time here , I highly recommend it , worth the drive for us , friends flew in from out of town saying let's go here , drinks amazing , staff super friendly , . Really clean ,enough space to sit around ..1/2 price appetizer always a hit , we had enough food to share ..the waiter recommended drinks and they were awesome"}
{"text":"Have gone to the D.C. Ranch location numerous times always had great service and wine. Tried food once and it wasn't good. Oysters were fishy, lettuce wraps tasteless. Wine was good:) decided to give their food another go at the new location. My friend and I came in for lunch and yet again it was a disappointment. I had a Ceasar salad with salmon. Salmon was way over cooked and super fishy. I actually got sick from it later on in the day. We shared fries which are not bad. My friend got a chicken salad sandwich and it looked liked it sat around somewhere for awhile and tasted worse than it looked? place is great for wine and ambiance. Cute couches and good service.Will never eat here again tho."}
{"text":"So I went looking for something different for date night with the SO, and found a place where we could dine on couches.  I was all excited but when I got there, I realized I eat on couches all the time at home.

Music is OK outside on the patio.   Inside was more dance club noise level.

And small portions.  Living Room, your flat bread is so flat, that it makes everyone's mama look fat.   

It's an OK place to bring your SO.  Not a good place to bring her a second time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wonderful cosmopolitans, great service and good food!  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We went back and tried the living room for a second time and the service was much better!  The Sangria was excellent!  We tried more menu items, but still didn't make it to dessert.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is a trendy and relaxing place to meet up with friends for a drink or meal. Great outdoor space with couches, etc. With that said, the down side is that they are overly pet friendly to the point it can be disturbing to those w/o pets. We were sitting next to another couple who brought 4 dogs on leashes with them and sat down to eat. The dogs were walking near other couches, bumping plates, etc. it would be nice to eat without having animals everywhere...and these were not service dogs."}
{"text":"Went here with friends for a Saturday lunch. I had a chicken salad sandwich, my friends had pulled pork sliders, chicken flatbread pizza with a cup of butternut squash soup, and half roast beef sandwich with a cup of the turkey and steak chili.  We split a choice of 4 bruschetta and a chocolate chip cookie pizza. Drinks were sodas, ice tea, and a skinny bitch.  Overall, the food ranged from tasty to surprisingly good, and we all offered up tastes of our meals. The butternut squash soup was the standout, along with the steak & gorgonzola bruschetta. If you go, make sure to try those two items. The skinny bitch was more vodka than peach in flavor, but sipped slowly over the course of two hours was nice.  The ambiance is relaxed and inviting... living up to its name! Sit inside on the couches near the bar and there are fun games to play. We amused ourselves with some of the questions from their Would You Rather? game.  All in all, a delightful experience which I would happily try again."}
{"text":"This is always our go-to place for a fun night out.  The staff is always friendly and fun, the atmosphere is upbeat yet not too overpowering.  The food is limited but really good, too.  Try the cheese fondue and the sliders.  Yummy!  Also, a nice casual lunch spot as well."}
{"text":"Great place! Great looking crowd! Good drinks and good food. The DJ could be a little better but other than that no complaints. The staff is nice and top of it!"}
{"text":"Was here for Winterlicious 2017 and only slightly regret dropping $50+ on dinner since the place was so classy and romantic and the food was so good, from taste to portion size. My favorite was their vegan chocolate truffle dessert!! I loved it so much that I would totally go back just for the chocolates. If you're a fan of dark chocolate that doesn't pride itself on being sweet, but rather on the incredibly silky texture and the unique rich, bitter-salty flavor, this dessert will fulfill all your dreams :)

The appetizer was most underwhelming - I ordered the vegan minestrone soup and felt that it tasted and looked like it came from a can. Nothing wrong with that, but wish I ordered the calamari appetizer instead, which was much bigger than I expected (batter to squid ratio was sad though) and came with squid ink. The salmon entree was delicious - the salmon itself was normal, but the couscous was really yummy and the berry sauce was a perfect sour and sweet balance. 

The service here is 5/5- our server that night was the best! He was attentive, but not overly in our faces. Most importantly, he was very candid about his opinion of the menu options. For example, he recommended against the vegan entree, which is apparently lacking in flavor. He also warned me about the non-sweetness of the vegan chocolate. 

Will be back again after I patch the hole in my wallet!"}
{"text":"Coming here pretty much ruined taking my wife out for dinner on her birthday.  Never to return and would caution those considering.

Pros:
Server was down to earth, friendly and helpful.

Vegan corn pasta was very tastey - the spinach complimented the sauce nicely.

Wifes most enjoyed aspect of the meal was the cappacino (more of a con actually)

Interesting decor and accessible parking garage very close by

Cons:
I looked at the vegan menu online and went there thinking we could order those items.  A server mentioned the menu on their website is over 2 years old and wasn't available - made no appologies.  How do you not update your website for 2 years.

Service was very slow.  Probably waited almost 2 hours total for our orders and the place was less than a third occupied.  

Ordered drinks before meal and waited a ridiculous amount of time for them.  Another server came by and asked us if we got out drinks to which we replied no.  He said he would check on them and must have forgot because we got them quite awhile after that.

Wife got the lobster bisk but could not taste lobster - oddly tasted more like a werthers candy

Vegan chips hummus appetizer was disappointing 

Didnt get my tea after dinner - after waiting awhile told the server and he went to tell someone.  Got the wrong order for tea - ordered green tea, whatever it was tasted like peach

Vegan desert was mediocre but at least there was an option."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Too bad as the atmosphere is good,  an above average menu and fair pricing. I recommend going once just to observe how dysfunctional the staff is....seriously it is so bad it's funny. Been enduring this for 3 years....i know that's sad but it's close by my house. Today however was my last visit period."}
{"text":"Been here twice and really enjoyed it.  I typically like more mellow places that are a little bit more quiet or low key but this is a nice change.  Mix of young and old, reasonably good list of wines by the glass, the food is pretty good as well.  had a french dip this last time that was great.  The flat bread pizzas a good too.  Nice atmosphere, busy on weekends, and around 9 or 10 it transitions to being a little louder with a lounge/club feel.  Cool place for the east valley."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great menu selection, love the ambiance and the drinks rock!  My new favorite on Market Street."}
{"text":"Great bruschetta, and the atmosphere is quite nice.  I would like to try lunch here, as the dinner crowd was a little loud for my taste (must be getting old)."}
{"text":"I only come on Sundays for the live music and fun atmosphere! The food is ok, and the drinks are fine, but definitely not spectacular, there are way better places nearby, so this place gets 3 stars because of the AMAZING entertainment and great wine deals."}
{"text":"I would give it three stars because it was so over packed, but this is a very good place to hang out, especially if you can get the couches on the patios.  I was there as part of an Events and Adventures event so I am uncertain what the crowd would be like by yourself, but the food was very good."}
{"text":"Living Room is a nice and low key spot with a good vibe and plenty of  indoor and patio seating options. Not sure if they always have live music on Sunday's but they did last week and the guitarist was really good. Took a chance on the sushi while there and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and portion sizes. Definitely an option for a return visit."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu is good and  pricing on the wines easy on the wallet. 9 selections that range from $2 to $7 dollars.

There are 31 wine options by the glass for Happy Hour that run from $5 to $13. Most in the $6 to $9 dollar range. Ambiance is good and the place is hipster. I would say it is a spot to be seen; If you know what I mean. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"As the name would have you imagine... tons of comfortable chairs and couches make this the ultimate spot to lounge (indoor or outdoor) while you sip and converse.

Sundays they do 1/2 bottles of wine, and had live music.... awesome.

Can't speak for the food."}
{"text":"Chandler can be pretty darn cool. Just take a look at The Living Room, a happening indoor/outdoor bar with an attractive wait staff, tasty sangria and om nom nommable eats. Now that I work in Chandler full-time, it's quickly become my favorite go-to for happy hour and lunch, with a vibe that's more downtown Phoenix than family-filled suburbs.

The place is open and airy, with the indoors spilling out to the patio, no wall dividing the two. Dark wood and burnt orange furniture decorate the space, with the funky color scheme giving the spot a Mediterranean vibe. Comfy couches surrounded by fireplaces outside are perfect for lounging, while high-tops and an expansive bar with sports televisions inside give drinkers and diners more options.

The place gets packed during \"normal\" happy hour time, but if you're a day drinker, you're in luck, since happy hour prices are available from open to 6 p.m. Definitely try a glass of sangria ($5 during happy hour) - I loved the red version I got, since it was really fruity but strong. There's an extensive wine list, as well as a mixed cocktail selection, if fruity sangria isn't your thing.

The food at The Living Room is also mighty tasty. The Caprese sandwich ($9.95), with thick mozzarella, a pesto sauce, juicy grape tomatoes and a balsamic glaze that perfectly ties everything together, is delicious. I love it with a mixed green salad with lemon caper vinaigrette - the salad reminds me of another favorite salad of mine, at The Main Ingredient in Phoenix.

Even if you don't live in Chandler, I'd say The Living Room is a destination spot and should entice you to venture out South if you don't usually head that direction."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see that Market Street DC Ranch has a fun spot for N. Scottsdale residents to enjoy a night out with some drinks in hand! Now, while I didn't get to partake in the drink portion of the experience (only a couple more months to go before Baby D arrives!), I did get to enjoy the atmosphere and a nice night out with my husband. 

The atmosphere here is lively without being too crazy. It's perfect for a date night out or if you are looking for a lively atmosphere without going to a bar or club. Now if you don't like wine, don't let title of wine bar fool you. It's got a full bar and plenty of non-wine options. 

Their food menu consists of plenty of options to share, including bruschetta boards, flat breads and sandwiches. Their food is good too! I had the chicken salad sandwich and my husband had the French Dip, both which were tasty! We also tried the bruschetta board which I highly recommend. I also noticed that they do brunch on the weekends! Mimosa's anyone!?"}
{"text":"Don't ask my why, but I was pleasantly surprised and not expecting to find a place like the Living Room hidden on Queen Creek Road. But, I'm happy to see that it exists! 

When I arrived, the exterior looked like a winery and should have been surrounded by grapevines instead of parked cars. I walked through the entry of large wooden doors and to the left drinkers lounged in an open bar area while restaurateurs ate in the surrounding tables. The atmosphere was cozy and true to a wino's environment with dark wood and wine everywhere. The restaurant was surrounded by a patio equipped with my favorite: fire places! Since it was a cold night, a fire place was a perfect touch. 

At first it seemed like we were under dressed for the atmosphere, but after looking around in more depth, I noticed that people were dressed in everything from Scottsdale bar goer clothes to jeans and t-shirts. So I came to the conclusion that like more places in AZ, any attire goes as long as your clothed. 

The food was decent for the type of food they offer. We shared the bruschetta trio to start which was similar to other wine bars I've visited. I went the salad route which was like a Mary Poppins salad because it didn't seem to ever disappear! The sandwiches also looked tasty but if you're hungry with an appetite, I suggest getting an appetizer with your entree. Men, do go here expecting a hearty meal. I would suggest ordering two appetizers and your entree if you're really hungry. 

So in summary, this really did feel exactly like a living room and now I want to check out their newest location on 7th!"}
{"text":"Went to The Living Room Saturday night with a group of approximately 17 people.  I had been here once before and thought it was great so I recommended it for my friend's birthday party.  We called ahead and reserved space earlier in the week.  We arrived on time and were asked to wait for our area.  We waited for about 15 minutes and were shown to an area that had seating for about 10 people.  We were told we would get the area next to us once the two ladies who were currently in that space left.  We waited for service for what seemed to be a long time.  The waiter finally came over, he was nice however it was very slow getting drinks for the large party.  We planned on eating dinner here but we had one small table and for 16 people it wasn't even enough space for drinks let alone dinner.  As more guests arrived the space got tighter and we noticed that the ladies next to us who were \"almost leaving\" as per our server were just ordering dinner, then more drinks then dessert.  Apparently calling ahead earlier in the week to reserve space for 16 did not include the staff to reserve an adequate space for everyone.  Finally after our guests were hungry and in need of a seat they began to leave.  We asked the staff several times and were given the same answer-as soon as these ladies left the space was ours.  

The ladies finally left and we jumped on the space just in time to not have another party take the area.  None of the staff was monitoring this for us.  

Our bill was about $600 and I feel we received terrible service.  No one who was with us that night would ever return.  They definitely do not know how to treat their guests.  I would think a $600 tab would warrant a little better service.  They really dropped the ball.  There are plenty of other wine bars worth trying out where I'm sure guests are treated much better."}
{"text":"First time coming and I'll be back! With a group of girlfriends enjoying good food and drinks. Loved the setting, could have turned the lights up a tad bit but I get it. Our serve was attentive and friendly and made great suggestions. This place was great for a girls get together or date night."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear another Livingroom was coming to Scottsdale. The one at D.C. Ranch is a little to far North. It's where Posh Boutique used to be, at the Shops at Gainey Village. Pomo is next door (left) and a Mexican restaurant is to the right. Tight quarters but they make it work. We sat outside by the fire pit & they had live music. After 3pm on Sunday's it's 1/2 off bottles of wine so we orders a Pino Noir (Meiomi) & a Moscato bottle. The Moscato was chilled perfectly & sat in a chiller bucket next to us. We ordered their bruschetta (Greek, Italian, Chop & Chicken) & as always it was delicious. We also ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp & the Caprese app. My friend ordered the Korean style lettuce cups & he liked them. I have had their roasted red pepper hummus & lamb chops (in the past) at another TLR location. Lastly we ordered the doughnut holes that you inject either chocolate, raspberry or vanilla filling into. Neat idea. I'll definitely be frequenting this spot now that there is one closer to home. Carter our waiter was fabulous!"}
{"text":"When I come here,  I feel like I'm in my living room! I love it! This place gets crazy busy most weekends.  There's comfy couches and lounge chairs.  Has a nice patio that you can enjoy while drinking wine.  I've had the food here too.  Fairly typical of a wine bar... bruchetta, pizzas, salads, sandwiches... but it's all good stuff. If you're into djs, they have that on Saturday.  This is my wine bar of choice."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio which was nice. Wait staff was attentive enough & answered all our questions. My friend & I each ordered a chicken Cobb salad. It was good... my issue was that it was small & we were charged another $2.00 each for avocado. Really? Who doesn't put avocado in a Cobb Salad as a standard ingredient? Or for that matter bacon or blue cheese! $14.45 for small portion of lettuce, grape tomato, egg with chicken breast (in its whole state... not sliced, not diced... just a hunk of chicken). WAY too expensive. Two salads, 1 ginger ale and a water. Bill over $50 with tip. Nope... won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place was different and fun.it has really good food and amazing service. I plan on coming back every chance I get!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, food was overpriced and small portions. Have no plans to return."}
{"text":"Went to the Living Room over the weekend with some girlfriends.  Having never been there before I didn't know what to expect.  The place is super adorable, great decor.  The bar set-up is very weird though.  It's like, half bar then turns into half table.  I had to wait for my friends to show up and we were on the list, and I had a hard time finding a decent place to just stand.  The place was packed, and it was 8pm on a Saturday night, with a torrential downpour going on outside.  I thought it would be quiet wtih the craptastic weather, but it definitely was busy. 

It's loud.  Not only from people talking/yelling but the music.  I was screaming at my friends at our table.  For being a wine bar, I thought the wine menu was on the small side.  A good selection, but I thought I'd see more. 

The crowd is definitely distinct.  You have to really like it to tolerate the place.  For me, I really liked it.  It's livly, lots of young 30-somethings (although we ran into our old, formerly hot, teachers from high school which was weird), lots of good looking people, yet it didn't feel pretentious to me at all.  I just moved here from a big city and I felt like I was back home.  Which is a good thing.

Food was average.  I'd try something else next time I go back.  This time I had the chicken pesto sandwich with a side salad.  The sandwich was very good but the dressing that came with my salad was SUPER SALTY!! Gross!  I just passed on it and ate the rest. 

I also like the fact that they do board games here.  And the patio is probably amazing when the weather cooperates."}
{"text":"I have been here once before and it was an awesome experience. The environment is rustic and eclectic. Their food is a mix of American grill and wine bar frommage. The concept is wonderful. The reason for my low rating is due to the service during our most recent venture. We got there and were sat immediately. The waitress brought is a chilled water carafe and glasses. It was downhill from there. We ordered drinks and our first round of food. We specifically asked that one menu be left behind as we planned on ordering more. After that, our waitress kept disappearing to socialize with the other waitress, and bartender. We finished our food and the only round of drinks we got to order and then sat there and waited. And waited. And made eye contact with several staff, and waited. By the time she finally came back around, we had our card waiting for her to close out the tab. We had to go to a second place just to finish eating lunch. Check in's are important to make sure your table is satisfied, especially when your table indicates that they want to order more from you."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. I have been here twice within the past week. I came once for brunch and had the Eggs Benedict, which was fantastic. I also love the $12 bottomless mimosa deal! I am a big fan of anywhere I can bring my dog to, as well, and this was the perfect place. I will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Apps were good.  Great space to hang,  relax, and chat. If it gets busy it gets loud and not \"intimate\" since it is basically one large room. 

This is really more of an older crowd (40s-50s-60s) pickup joint / bar than anything else. 

A good place to hang for an early nibble and a drink but not a place I'd go to have a serious meal or to hang out too long since I'm not cougar hunting. ;)"}
{"text":"Great setting for happy hour or any time of day. Very eclectic and welcoming. Love the outdoor couches and chairs. The inside is just as cute and welcoming. 

My husband and I, along with our 2-year old came for happy hour on a recent trip. We sat on the patio and enjoyed a few of their appetizers and drinks. Great food and drink selection, great atmosphere, and great service. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Service was bad and food was mediocre. Arriving with a party of 8 we asked for the host to place two tables inside together but were told they couldn't do so. It was 2 O'clock in the afternoon with no one in the entire restaurant so they could have easily accomodated us. We sat out on the patio which had low patio chairs and tables making it difficult to eat. When all our food arrived there was little room on the coffee style outdoor table to hold the dishes. The French fries were served with two condiments that when we passed around fell off the under sized plate on to one of our guests shoe. The beef sliders were terrible. The beef was paper thin and had no flavor. The chicken pesto flat bread was over cooked and bland. The patio chairs had bird droppings on them that has to be cleaned before we sat down. Dont bother!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and appetizers - super busy even on a Thursday but service was good."}
{"text":"Hopped over from the Vig to continue Sunday Funday. They have bottomless mimosas for $12 and use 95 rate bubbles. They also have a great looking crepe and omelette bar on weekends. If we have not eaten earlier I would of definitely gotten the southwest crepes!! Living Room never disappoints."}
{"text":"Don't get fool by the ambiance and the location. This place sucks. I've ordered a simple eggs Benedict for brunch and they messed it up. How you can mess up a simple eggs Benedict? Seriously. The poached eggs came out super hard/overcooked and not much/enough hollandaise. And it took them an hour to have all our orders out for our group. I will never recommend and won't come back to this place. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience, great selection of food (including cheeses and small plates and mmmm) but best of all, what amazing service. Have never been so well taken care of - the experience carefully curated and the manager really went out of her way to make it just awesome. Choc dipped strawberries are a must. Sweet Jesus you have no idea..."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a friend. I was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency of the waiter, Zack. He was very personable. The food was very good and well presented. The fries were awesome. Happy hour prices for wine were observed during lunch hour. I would return anytime. Weekend brunch looked delightful also."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this restaurant as the food is very good and the atmosphere is very relaxed. They have great outdoor seating with comfy furniture for kicking back and having a glass of wine with girlfriends. The only knock I have is on their dessert specifically the donut holes. They come with these injectable syringes to put a filling in the middle which is a great idea but the chocolate filling was simple Hershey syrup and the berry filling was a thick gelatinous cheap filling. I was disappointed as they could easily whip up a chocolate ganache and some type of berry filling that wasn't out of a jar. Being they only have 2 desserts on on the menu I thought they should have put a little more thought into this one. Aside from that my experience is there always very good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today! Very very cute place to eat. Would be awesome for a Sunday brunch. I love the rustic look outside and the interior decor, very appealing. 
The people working there were super nice and friendly which is awesome. The menu was a pretty good size. Usually I would go for breakfast, but the lunch looked awesome so I decided on that. I went with my family, and we all found what we wanted pretty quickly! My mom and sister shared a chicken sandwich, my dad got the margherita flatbread, and I got bruschetta. I chose four: traditional (tomato basil mozzarella), mushroom, orchard (apples, fig, brie, honey), and one with goat cheese, pepper jam, and peppers. My meal was so good, I was asked which one was my favorite and I had trouble deciding because they were all so delicious. I think the orchard one was probably my favorite. Sometimes with bruchetta there's too much bread or it gets super soggy and gross, but this one was good. A nice bread to topping ratio. My dad loved his flatbread, and my sister and mom liked the sandwich. I stole a few fries from them and they were good. Portions were a little smaller than expected for the bruchetta and flatbread, but otherwise no complaints on the food. Also we finished with a pizookie which was an incredible decision because it was absolutely delicious. Only real downside was how loud this place was, we had to almost yell to hear each other, and it was not even that crowded. I'd like to go back though! I bet it's a fun place to go at night also."}
{"text":"I wish I could write this place two reviews, because the difference between when you go is like night and day. Might as well be two different places.

Weeknights are great. This is the place to lounge around on their beautiful patio with a glass of wine(or three) and amazing small plates. A great spot for warm summer nights. Service was impeccable and prices were perfect. Plus the staff actually know their stuff when it comes to their wines and what to recommend. 

But then there's the weekend...
Made the mistake of taking the husband on a Friday night and we didn't even stay for a drink. Apparently this is THE place for the Chandler cougar crowd and the 40-50 somethings acting like bnoxious 20 year olds. I hate to generalize but when you walk in and get the stink eye from three 60 yr old ladies in mini skirts, it hardly encourages affection. We walked in and the place was packed. It's a bar on a weekend, that's to be expected. But there was no one around with a wait list, and the place isn't set up to have a lobby or really even a host stand. All I could assume was that it was a free for all seating plan and we didn't feel like wading through the mob of  soccer dads in affliction shirts to try to reach the bar. 

Definitely can't recommend on the weekend, and if you do attempt it, keep in mind that there is absolutely nothing else in the area as far as bars or nightlife so you may be stuck trekking it into Chandler or Tempe to find something else to do. As for me, I'm not so sure I'm going to risk heading out there anywhere near a weekend unless the vibe changes drastically."}
{"text":"Great vibe. 
I had heard of the Living Room through friends and tried out the location in Ahwatukee. 
Stopped in this location for happy hour after work. 
Great atmosphere and esthetic.  
The staff was friendly and attentive. 
Will definitely be back as well as checking out other Living Room locations."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is super cool and the prime rib sliders are to die for! Beverages aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I must say that my first instinct is to stay away from places that market themselves as wine lounges. Not a wine guy so the food portion of the offering has to be substantive to get me there. 
Today I succumbed to letting convenience trump my core values. 
And guess what? I triumphed. 
I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip served with fries. 
The bomb!
The protein was delicious augmented by a layer of Swiss cheese. 
The accompanying white sauce with horseradish made the sandwich even better. Although I must say that I would have preferred a much stronger hint of horseradish. 
The au jus was disappointing. Too salty for my taste. 
The fries were, honestly, some of the best I have had recently. Crisp, properly seasoned. 
So I have to say my stereotype of wine lounges has been challenged. 
A good thing because it opens up more avenues to enjoy delish!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Divinyls - I Touch Myself)

I love Bo Bites, I want you to know me
When I feel hungry, I want to go feasting
I research myself, I want to go Yelping
I order myself, I want you to show me

I don't want something else
When I think about it, The Living Room
Oh, I don't want something else, oh no
Oh, no, oh, no

This is a pretty hot place for to hangout for some wine and drinks!

I came here with a large group of people and the place was popping already.  The living room the perfect title to describe the ambiance plus a full on bar of course.  It was pretty warm that day so I didn't order any wine, but this is definitely a wine and appetizer joint.  I totally went the opposite and shot for a beer and an entree flatbread!  Overall, the Big Pig; they call it, is meat pizza.  It came along with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, and salami.  I would defer from the \"Big\" part since it was appetizer size in my opinion, but it was plated and pretty darn good; salty and savory ingredients atop a warm crusty flatbread along with crushed peppers and cheese.  Guess you can say I was the \"Big Pig\"!  

I really enjoyed ambiance and plus the service was on top of things.  Again we had a large group, but they were able to accommodate us without a skip!  If you're ever in the DC Ranch area; I would totally recommend this spot! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this establishment before being invited here the other night. From the outside it looks cute. The exterior is covered in curtains. Like a living room; hence the name. Inside, its rather small. Its your typical wine bar - simila looking to Postino. I'm not sure how things go here on a regular weeknight, but I can tell you, on a busy saturday night, its a mess. At least that was my experience. 

I was here attending a birthday celebration for a friend. They put her large party in the center of the bar area. With the DJ right in front . Oh and just a couple feet away was the bathroom. Which had a large line spilling into our area. Our waitress appeared to be trying her best to do her job but wasnt able to easily make her way around our table to take orders because the area was so cramped. 

The wine list was pretty subpar. The cheese plate was, eh.  

My real issue here was the Dj. I'm sure hes a great guy just trying to pursue a hobby. Or maybe his passion. Whatever the case may be, in this particular place he is playing the wrong music. If I'm at a wine bar I'm thinking of a place where people can talk while sipping wine. I think something ambient is a appropriate. Perhaps a live musician? I hear they have one on occasion. Something relaxing. This guy was playing full on booty bumpin tunes. There was no room to do the cupid shuffle so I'm not sure why he played it. He played the standard Chandler club tunes. From like, 4 years ago. The music was bad and severely out of place. 

If this place wants to be a club, it should be a club. If it wants to be a wine bar, it should be a wine bar. But the two are not one in the same or even similar.  

It was all underwhelming. I've lived in Chandler and I know the suburb is lacking in nightlife so I hope this place improves."}
{"text":"What a seriously disappointing evening. The weather was great so we opted to sit on the patio and enjoy it. We had one initial server come take our drink order and recommended a white wine when I asked for red. Easily fixable and he recommended a great Cabernet, it was also by far the most expensive glass at almost $17 but I took the recommendation as a good show of faith. When someone else delivered our drinks, they brought out the aforementioned white wine. When we pointed out the error the situation was rectified but not without me having to say a second time that was not what I ordered. Off to a rocky start. From here on out we had a different server. We ordered a second round of double Makers Mark neat and a whiskey sour. Well... the Makers Mark was served with a glass full of ice, which isn't neat at all. And my whiskey sour was served with sweet and sour mix and a glass of ice, it was pretty dreadful and not at all what a whiskey sour should be. I was really hoping for some frothy egg whites served up. The fact that the server didn't know what neat meant was also a red flag. I then ordered a Jameson and soda because I thought there was no way for them to mess it up (and they didn't). 

For food we started with the spinach and artichoke dip that was pretty good and decently priced for happy hour. It took forever for our server to come back to get our dinner order. I ordered the Ahi tuna salad and my date ordered the pepperoni flatbread. My salad was not the greatest unfortunately. The Ahi tuna was not fresh and had the funky fish taste that people who say they don't like sushi imagine. The dressing was lacking and there wasn't much substance to the rest of the salad minus a couple wasabi peas. I actually forgot there was supposed to be avocado until I got to the couple small pieces at the bottom. 

I was embarrassed to have picked this place for a date, they really missed the mark in several categories. Service was slow and not very professional for what you're expecting with this type of ambience and price point. Food was uninspired and drinks were lazily prepared."}
{"text":"I am always happy every time I come.  Love how I am treated (well, our Pilates crew).  Robert was our server and he took excellent care of us!  We always come back and we will refer him to everyone."}
{"text":"Happy hour til 6 every day. Cool vibe, great wine list, awesome bruchetta. Garage door walls open up to patio seating. I'm sure we'll be spending some time at the Living Room now that we've found it."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Ahwatukee for happy hour and was very disappointed. It was a Monday at 5pm, and service was awful. Only four tables and we had to constantly wave to get anyone's attention. And the flat bread was like cardboard! Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The Living Room is one of my favorite spots in North Scottsdale!! Their Superfood Salad & Bruschetta are two of my favorite dishes. Not only is the food amazing, but the service is fabulous as well. Mikey is usually our server, and he is very helpful when choosing meals and also drinks. He has never recommended a bad wine, and he even remembers my friends and I when we come in. The other staff members are also extremely friendly as well, and the atmosphere is impeccable. I would HIGHLY recommend visiting this restaurant because you are sure to have a great dinner with even better service! Thanks guys, and keep it up."}
{"text":"Hosted a baby shower here in May and it was perfect! From start to finish the staff at the Living Room went above and beyond to assist with anything we needed!! The food was all delicious.. especially the breakfast burrito and donut holes (yum!) but honestly everything we ordered was great!!! We would def come back here for brunch and go check out their Mexican restaurant/ tequila bar right next door!! I seriously wish I could give more than 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, treated with disrespect over $12 dollar glass of sparkling wine that was disgusting and a $38.00 cheese & charcuterie board that was a joke. bartender, manager, owner of hotel all refused to offer an apology or any remedy."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here since the other wine bar closed down.  The Living Room did a great remodel and the place is very stylish and energetic with an upscale feel.

The spinach-artichoke dip and the cheeseburger sliders made for some tasty share-able appetizers.

Where things went south was at the bar.  I ordered a Union Jack IPA and the female bartender charged me $7 instead of the $6 that was listed on the menu.  She said they round up after tax.  Well tax in Scottsdale is 7.95% so my drink should have been $6.48 and rounding up to $7 is a blatant ripoff.  I'm not sure if she is just a rogue bartender or there is a problem here with management.

There's a lot to like about this place but keep a close eye out for bartenders lining their pockets at your expense."}
{"text":"We had my baby shower here and everyone loved it. The service was great and food was perfect temp and portion. I recommend the hummus. Prices are great and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Perfect time to enjoy the patio here - used to live in the area, but this time we are visiting from out of state and just happened to be staying at the hotel across the street - friendly staff, knowledgeable wine recommendations and a varied menu. Since the menu has changed, I am trying something new tonight and am quite happy with my choice (Living room club with the awesome fries)."}
{"text":"Food is good but had a gift card and apparently they are location specific gift cards very stupid u offer gift cards they should be good at all your locations even if they are independently owned and operated"}
{"text":"We have mostly visited on weekends and every encounter had been good. Food is consistent and service is attentive and interested.

Food is basically bar food but it's good."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite spot for a glass of wine and lots of friendly people. Quintessential AZ indoor out dining."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we had a really great time. I am  updating my previous post because I didnt have a good time at all before. She and I had a couple drinks and appetizers and everything was awesome this time. A bit loud but thats to be expected. I really do like this place now!"}
{"text":"Eclectic inside, great service, food is wonderful. Bottomless mimosas are a plus on the weekend and there's no wait! Can't lose here!"}
{"text":"Wow so surprised to read such mixed reviews! Our first experience there was great. We started with a big fat hot pretzel and my husband enjoyed the dipping mustards. I added melt brie to dip in.  Whilst a touch expensive very delicious. My husband ordered a crispy flat bread with many toppings. I had the Korean lettuce wraps. We both tasted both. Delicious,  although the wraps were a little spicy for my taste. 
We will definately return and taste other delicious offerings. I am usually suspicious of extremely varied menus but everything delivered around us looked wonderful.
 In looking over the selection I was not too thrilled with some of the sides combined with the protein I would select. Hopefully sides can be substituted!
The service was great! Team waiting, smiling friendly faces."}
{"text":"WOW...The service was outstanding! I was immediately received a warm & friendly greeting both at the host stand and at the table. I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir that was too sweet for my liking but Katie immediately exchanged it for me. She also accommodated my friend, that was a bit high maintenance wth her very specific drink requests, and checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything.  The food and drinks were fantastic but it was the great service that impressed me the most."}
{"text":"bad service on Saturday except  afternoon, receptionist didnt want us to sit at a couch, no reason, we sat at one anyway. Ordered brushetta  wasnt great just good. Between bad service and food, we left after a glass of wine"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Living Room. It has a wonderful ambiance with indoor and outdoor seating. I've been here both for happy hour as well as late night drinks. The happy hour is great -- $5 select wines, $2.50 drafts including KiltLifter? I'm a fan! Even otherwise, the drink prices are standard fare for a nice place in Chandler.

On all occasions, my friends and I have ordered something to munch. We always get the prime rib sliders and the bruschetta. Both are amazing!

Given the nice ambiance, this is also a great date spot, especially when the weather is nice. The outside seating especially is cozy and you can get your drink on while having a good conversation with your date. The service is not pushy at all.

There are two reasons for docking a star from this review -- 
1) The vegetarian menu is somewhat limited
2) The food prices are a little high. E.g., the flatbread will set you back $8 and is a small portion. I'm not a big guy and I could eat two of those as an appetizer! There are no food specials for happy hour

Would I got back? Absolutely! But probably for happy hour and the yummy sliders!

Pros -- Ambiance, Happy Hour, Sliders!
Cons -- Overall food prices"}
{"text":"Music was way to loud for a restaurant setting!   Did not feel a good vibe from the moment I stepped in.  Menu is about what I expected.    Waiter brought a second drink when we didn't want one.   A different person walking by cashed us out and shorted our change by $10.00.     We grabbed our waiter and told him. He put his hands in the air said I was not part of the transition so I don't want to deal with it, who was it I will get them.   He left and went in his way.    We went to the bar asked for the manager who came over and took care of the issue."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The waitstaff was incredible! The food was very good. They have an amazing patio for enjoying the outdoors. We went on a date here and we're very pleased with the food and the service. The atmosphere made the experience that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy the early afternoon atmosphere at The Living Room.  More on the quiet side. We usually get a glass of wine and the bruschetta.  Bruschetta is good but they will need to improve on it somewhat when Postino's opens in Gilbert very soon. All of the servers have been extremely  friendly each time we have gone.  We have not been to TLR during their busiest times.  Sounds like we wouldn't want to with what I am hearing about noise levels. :-)"}
{"text":"Nice place,  friendly staff.  Great menu.  But,  after appetizers,  we became invisible to the staff.   The manager/owner became very excited about a big table near us (he was our original server) and decided he had bigger fish to fry than our paltry table of three.   We flagged down someone and ordered some more food which showed up some time later...cold.   It wasn't supposed to be cold..at least I don't think so.  I am not in a hurry to go back or suggest it to friends...    Great idea.  Good chef/menu choices executed well.  Poorly run floor....poor enough to not go back.  Maybe after a few more reviews like this,  the floor will catch up to the kitchen....then I will try again."}
{"text":"This place was such a pleasant surprise! We had dinner with friends and the food was phenomenal. The waiter guided us through the menu and offered us some exceptional choices. 

The lamb chops were amazing, they fell of the bone. 
The salmon was so moist and grilled to perfection. 
The appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip was so creaming and smooth. 
The dessert was a fondue of chocolate with chopped up apples, strawberries, pretzels and marshmallows. Omg! It was mouth watering! 

The music was definitely retro and the atmosphere is warm, quiet and relaxing.

This place is a jewel it sparkles like a diamond in the back of a wooden box. This place is a must GO-TO place in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I hosted my annual brunch today at the Living Room. The service was awesome, Mashall was phenomenal! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great wine and the staff is very personable! It has a great relaxing atmosphere. A great place to take people for business or pleasure!"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

I'm really fond of \"Boutique Bars\" and The Living Room is one of the best. 

BOUTIQUE BARS 

What's a Boutique Bar?

A Boutique Bar is a term I use to describe America's take of the British Pub. 

More specifically, a Boutique Bar has everything expected from a high end American bar/restaurant, like an original impressive food/drink menu, a top notch location and edgy decor with exceptional service, and then add a pinch of the the British Pub vibe, by adding some cozy seating and promote the concept of staying around a while to hang out.

THE LIVING ROOM 

The Living Room is just this kind of place. 

There are three locations in Arizona:
Scottsdale
Chandler
Tucson

SCOTTSDALE LOCATION 

The Scottsdale location is located on Market Street at DC Ranch. 

The set up has an impressive bar, traditional restaurant seating, and a bunch of mix and match shabby chic sofas. It's the type of place you can come by yourself, on a date, or hang out with a group of friends. (see pics)

THE MENU

The menu is crazy yum! (see pics)

I posted the menu because describing it won't do it justice. (In fact, reading it won't do the food justice, so you will have to go try it!)

Appetizers:
Caprese
Spinach Artichoke Dip
Edamame
Bavarian Pretzel
Lamb Chops
Homemade Fries

Bruschetta 
Seafood
Lettuce Cups
Sushi Rolls
Meat & Cheese Board
Salads
Sandwiches
Burgers
Flatbread Pizza

Entrées:
Pan Seared Scottish Salmon
Lamb Chops
Steak Frites

Desserts

I got the four bruschetta sample plate:
You choose four you want to try from the selections of traditional, Greek, orchard, Italian, chop, and mushroom. 

I also got the meat and cheese board:
You choose three from the selections of prosciutto, Genoa salami, Coppa ham, sopressatta, white cheddar, mozzarella, goat cheese, Gorgonzola, smoked Gouda, Brie, Parmigiano, and Burrata. 

THE DRINKS

I also posted the drinks menu. (see pics)

The wine list is impressive and well thought out.

If you go to The Living Room website, you can check out a very interesting blog called \"Tom's Wine Blog\" by the owner of The Living Room, Tom Kaufman. It's obvious by the wine list how passionate Tom is about hunting down the best and most interesting wines.

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

My only complaint was the two bartenders were oddly disproportionately distracted/busy to the amount of people that were there at the time. But whatever, so minor compared to the whole experience.

5/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Absolutely INCREDIBLE food, service and drinks. Atmosphere- both inside and out is inviting, posh and just WOW. LEGIT experience!"}
{"text":"Music is so loud it's impossible to have a conversation.  When management was asked about this, he was unapologetic, said loud music is there concept.  Disclaimer - I am old, like a place that can talk without having to yell, feel like I'm having an argument."}
{"text":"We went here after I bought a local dines certificate.  The place is really cute!  There weren't a too many people there when we went, maybe 8 tables or so, and only one waitress.  She did an amazing job taking care of all the tables.  We had a few different types of the bruschetta and the fondue.  Everything was really tasty!  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here with with a bunch of girl friends for drinks and a bite. 

The mains dishes are mediocre (turkey burger was a little too greasy), dessert is good (gluten free truffles were quite good), and there aren't many small plate/appetizer options but the atmosphere is awesome. It's like an old library with high backed chairs and sofas. 

Great place to hang out for drinks! Not the best for food."}
{"text":"Great spot! Good eats, service and atmosphere. The ambiance is reminiscent of a seen from North Africa  ala Casa Blanca. When I return to AZ, will definately come back..."}
{"text":"I had eyed the Living Room restaurant/wine bar for some time and was lucky enough to come across a Groupon (good for lunch or brunch). 

The menu is decent, but nothing really jumped out as super inventive or impressive. My husband ended up ordering their Super Food Salad with an Ahi Tuna add on. The add on for the portion of tuna I think was a little steep, also considering they didn't cook it the way he asked. 

I ordered the eggs benedict, which was good, but again didn't really stand out. I asked them to switch out the fried potatoes for fruit. The order came to the table without fruit, so they brought a bowl of fruit when I asked about it. The fruit was nothing special, it reminded me of that pre-made in a bucket fruit salad that most restaurant suppliers sell. 

Service was ok, food was ok, but nothing to brag about. I wouldn't bother coming back at full price - it was ok, but only with a Groupon deal. 

I imagine it's better for late night drinks in a nice atmosphere. The decor as I said was lovely, bathrooms clean and modern and bathroom lighting perfect for fixing your hair or makeup (but unfortunately that doesn't equate to good food or service)."}
{"text":"Only place I've ever become a regular. Love the happy hour specials which are actually all day specials. Bartenders are friendly. Servers and service are always great. I love their food and always have a good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place and the variety on the menu.  I've enjoyed all my selections, to include the sushi, salads, sandwiches, and bruschetta. The staff is helpful and friendly and have their own favorites that they'll recommend if you ask. The Living Room hits the spot for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"RECOMMEND: we have heard how much fun The Living Room is, so we decided to pop in and see for ourselves. They remodeled the inside and it now looks and feels nothing like the previous wine bar. 

The vibe and energy are great. This type of spot is welcomed up north and they should be very successful here. 

The staff is friendly, especially Steven the manager. Cool guy. We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. I love how they have seats \"behind the bar\".  

The drinks are good and not a cup full of ice. I decided to order something to nosh on and selected the meat and cheese plate. Nice selection of meat and cheeses to choose from. 

We especially liked the fact that they were playing the UFC fight on TV. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Amanda was amazing. So attentive and knew exactly what wines we could pair with our food. I've been to the LR many times but never had such good service. Atmosphere great, the DJ was ok."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour and drinks.  Really can't beat pints at $2.50, good long happy hour 7 days a week.  The sandwiches are all good, the salads make great sides instead of the chips and the tiny cherry sized tomatoes are to die for whether you get it on the bruchetta or cheese board plate.  Thursday late happy hour gets pretty busy and so does friday late afternoon into late evening.  Saturday night it picks up after happy hour ends.  Wish they had burgers and fries like the Living Room in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. The sushi is amazing, the lamb is great and every appetizer is so tasty I ALWAYS have to get one!!! The servers are super helpful too if your stuck on what to get! I recommend everyone trying this place out."}
{"text":"The music was way better than the food! The food - horrible! The spinach dip tasted like lighter fluid!!!  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the way to go or weekend hang out spot. This place has COOL down to an art. 

With the cool vibe and music playing, the service is natural and doesn't miss a beat. Most of the time you have another drink before you realize you should have one. Everyone is on top of it, and other servers will usually bus your table or bring you more drinks. The place has a good teamwork feel to it. 

The food is all great but my favs are: pretzel and cheese, Bruschetta board (any of them) and the flat bread pizzas. I'm sure all of it is good but I'm still stuck on these three.

Make sure you get there before 4pm or you may have to stand for a while, but don't worry it'll be worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have no complaint re: their food and drink. As a matter of fact, I love them!!!!! But I don't think I'll go back there again. The music is just way too loud, and we were tired of shouting at each other. We (4 girls) had a plan to have dinner, but it was so loud that we decided to just have a drink here & dinner at the Sushi Room."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Daily Noon-6PM.

Went there on a Thursday night & it was pretty lively. Dark, cozy, comfortable...a great place to grab a beer, kick back, and play one of the many board games they have handy. 

Food is"}
{"text":"Great environment!  Delicious food.  Had sliders and they are excellent. Service was very cool too.  Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour birthday celebration with friends. It was not very crowded so at first was nice to talk and visit. But soon, the crowd got bigger and the music got louder. Impossible to talk without yelling in order to be heard. We looked around us and everyone was around our age or older, all with reading glasses and many with full heads of grey, yet the music sounded like something younger people would enjoy at a club in Old Town Scottsdale. We moved outside so we could hear each other. We must have asked for water four times. We had decided to get another drink if someone came with some water. The waiter who finally brought the water angrily set down the glasses, poured (or rather sloshed) from the bottle to fill the glasses. I guess he was angry because we had spent a bunch of money inside but hadn't ordered anything from him. Too bad he wasn't kind and patient, he would have had a full drink order. Food was very average, so not much reason to return."}
{"text":"I wish the Living Room offered something more unique. There just doesn't seem to be a niche or something special that makes them stand out from the crowd. Something that they are known for and enjoyed for! I had a very average experience at the Living Room. I came in oweek night for some wine. I sat at the bar and the service was fine. The wine list was extensive enough. I had a sauvignon blanc that was a tad too acidic and tart for my tastes. And I normally love non-sweet whites. I then switched to the rosé, which was great! Overall, I felt very neutral about my time at the Living Room. With so many new places opening all the time, and my seasoned favorites...I doubt I'll be back to the Living Room."}
{"text":"They have a great setup. I like the plaza it is located in and the quirky living room feel of the place. The indoor outdoor transition is seamless. We went during happy hour on a weeknight. There was plenty of discounted options. We ordered a plethora of cheese dishes (brie, spinach dip, cheese dip, flatbread). It was very yummy."}
{"text":"Well this was a strange first time... the place itself is ok. the litle tiny pizza (haha) was good. could have used more cheese even if it's suppose to be danty... My mix drink was horrible, the waiter was cute and nice. The crowd was... yuppy & snobby to the fullest I thought, but a very wide range in age.  good for a place to meet a group of friends not really a place for a couple or just two of you. The customers also broke out into a huge fight! which I felt really bad for the place, all the glass in the book shelf broke when the shelf FELL! The funny part was it was the yuppest place I have been since moving here and the only place a fight broke out and I have tried a few sketchy places as I learned my way around.  I'd give it another shot. probably really good for after work meet ups... not a saturday night on the town kind of place."}
{"text":"I came in with a larger group of about 10 in which reservations were made a week ahead of time but the staff seemed very unprepared to have us for Sunday brunch. No water, cups, or silverware were put out for us until we asked and we had to push our own tables together and find chairs for everyone. With experience managing restaurants I think it really shows initiative when an establishment takes the time to prepare for a known reservation and be well staffed for it.

As for the food, everything was well priced but nothing special, my table got mostly breakfast and took advantage of the \"bottomless mimosas\". Our food took quite awhile and came out very sporadic with the last dish coming out 10 minutes later than the first and many dishes were over cooked or the order was wrong.

May come back for their Sunday mimosas but the food was not memorable and I don't recommend ever coming here with a large group."}
{"text":"cute little spot. stopped here for HH and an impromptu bday celebration. they have $5 martinis, wine, sangria from 4-6pm. they have a nice selection of food. really simple stuff, sandwiches, salads, etc. the bruscetta appetizer was really good. i ordered the proscuitto and brie sandwich but i think i got roast beef instead...a little disappointing. our waitress prob just entered the order wrong but i'll give her a pass because she was very attentive and it seemed like she was new on the job. the pomegranate martini, it was good and strong, def worth $5. =)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for a friend's baby shower and tonight for dinner with a friend. Kind of torn about this place right now.

Tonight we were greeted and sat right away. I really like the porch and couch was very comfy. Our cocktails were brought out fast. They have a nice selection of \"skinny\" drinks - I got a skinny margarita, it wasn't good. My friend got the 'skinny bitch' which was pretty good. 

I ordered the bruschetta and honestly, it was just ok. I've had better (cough*Postinos*cough). Not a fan of the prosciutto. They need a higher quality meat and are too heavy handed on the fig jam. Chicken salad bruschetta? Not a fan of that one either. My friend ordered the caprese sandwich which was very good. Flavorful. Crunchy on the outside, inside was warm and melted in your mouth. The accompanying salad was good too.

Our meal was equally a hit and miss curiously enough. Service was good and I love the atmosphere. It wasn't all that bad overall so I'm willing to give it another shot. Perhaps happy hour...

(Sidenote: how can the service be pretty good here and AWFUL at the Sushi Room next door? I thought they are owned by the same owners...)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place! Wonderful scenery. Very comfortable fun atmosphere. Great customer service. The food is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service; took 30+ minutes just for the appetizer. My glass was empty for 15 minutes. They should consider hiring more servers"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I just barely knew about this place not too long ago. The atmosphere is very cozy and nice. It's a great place to hang out with good friends. Their wines are delicious, a lil on the expensive side, but of course, to get good wine it has to be pricey. Their food is so yummy. We ordered their bruschetta which had a whole lot of different toppings you can choose from. We also had a sandwich as well which was delicious. Love this place and will come again and again."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner. Strangely was forced to eat here because la sala was closed already at 840. Nothing really great, got a board, just ok. But got 3 salads all drowning in dressing. Saddening considering they each cost like $17 or more with some crappy chicken. We didn't even eat hardly
any of them. Changed servers mid way at 9pm. Other guy never came back. Had to ask for check $128 with 2 adults 2 kids. 3 margaritas. Premade already. Just pour. 

No interest in going back. Feel ripped off and unsatisfactory for amount spent. Way too many better places. Servers just want to leave"}
{"text":"Ok, let's get real. The music was too loud to talk. The food did not matter because we could not hear each other. We may go back, but I am not rushing back any time soon"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times since my Dad moved in across the street. I'm not sure if I've ever had a meal here or just drinks, but the staff is very friendly. I've definitely had a few bites off my family's plates, and what I had was good so far. Can't wait until I get to experience a full meal here. Hopefully this summer."}
{"text":"While I have had excellent experiences  here in the past, this last visit--bringing friends from Scottsdale to experience Chandler's restaurants--was embarrassing! The service was slow, incompetent and the bill incorrect. The food was delivered in piece-meal fashion, with two out of three orders being wrong. Message to server: If you can't remember it, why not write it down?!@ The food is great--but it might as well be self-service as we got our own refills for coke and iced tea. Since we came at an off-time and there were few guests, the problem was not that it was busy, it was incompetent. I am disappointed and would not bring friends back here."}
{"text":"The Living Room is a perfect place for any type of mood you're in. Terrific ambiance and super friendly and hard working staff. The crowd is mixed and diverse, providing for great opportunities to meet new people and mingle."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and great happy hour all day!!! Menu is extensive and sophisticated.  Sitting outside on a beautiful patio.   Aaaaaahhhh..."}
{"text":"I've been to both this location and Ahwatukee. I have mixed emotions about this place, because the restaurant really is great but the female wait staff is so scantily clad, it doesn't make me want to hang out here. I think the best way to describe it is an adult club scene, but with dinner. 

The food is REALLY good. At this location two of us had the pork chops with mint pesto and polenta. It is melt in your mouth delicious, and the mint pesto is the cherry on top.

I would come back for the food, but not for a drink since this particular atmosphere for a wine bar is not my personal scene."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my mom, aunt and boyfriend and had a great time! We were greeted right away and given options on where to sit and decided on some comfy couches. My boyfriend had a couple of cocktails and us ladies enjoyed a great bottle of Malbec between the three of us. Great selection of brochette served on wood planks. It was noisy while we were there but it all fit with the ambiance of the place. They have great happy hour deals and all the employees that we dealt with were really nice!! 

I would definitely go back the next time I visit AZ!!"}
{"text":"Great place, good wine and food, and a fantastic atmosphere. Great live entertainment as well, if you are looking for a fun wine bar, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Excellent sliders and cheese boards. Good selection of wine. And you can sit on couches and snuggle."}
{"text":"I have to compliment the service here! Crowded Friday night happy hour, my friend and I were lucky to find a small table in an outside corner - usually this is where the servers forget to come by - but we had great service. A very attentive waitress, our food was served hot and our wine glasses were never empty! :)"}
{"text":"We live in DC Ranch and we have a couple of pups, so this is HANDS DOWN one of our favorite places to go. Although we love OHSO for weekend brunches, this is a perfect alternative (and honestly, nicer).

They have live music every Saturday morning at 11am, and they recently added a BYO omelette station and BYO bloody mary bar! Of course you can never go wrong with bottomless mimosas. 

The bang bang shrimp lettuce wraps are some of my favorite (I'm a pescatarian)! We also love the bruschetta and the spinach artichoke dip. My sister swears by the prime rib french dip sandwich."}
{"text":"Our female server was excellent. I also liked how the menu has sushi but also fondue and pizza. Lots of variety on the menu and good drinks. They also had a cool dj and overall hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love coming here for bottomless mimosas! The food is also delicious. The only reason I gave 4 stars is for our waitress telling us we need to pay after 45 minutes of being there so that she could leave... but the two chandler locations 5 stars all the way! I love the veggie crepe."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious lunch.  Reserved ahead of time for 1pm on a Friday, totally empty.  It was just the two of us until the end of our stay.  Service was excellent, and the waiter was brutally honest when it came to dish recommendations (as I overhead); apparently the oysters have received negative reviews.  The mains were amazing, especially loved what they did with the grilled tofu and couscous.  My lunch date thought it was a light lunch, I thought it was the perfect amount.  Just a FYI, the bathrooms are upstairs, you'll have to take the elevator to get up there.  The decor was lovely, and it was great having the entire place to ourselves.  Would certainly return."}
{"text":"I thought the ambiance and food were great. Reasonable prices, too. My fiance and I tried The Living Room for the first time on Valentine's Day and we had a great experience. We ate the brushcetta, roast beef and brie panini, and a cheese platter. Everything was delicious as was the wine. Great live music too!"}
{"text":"Cute and all about the experience but a little over priced. Great for a first date night or a couples date to catch up on what's been goin' on lately. The bruchetta was really yummy, the fondue was a waste of money and the wine was of course awesome. Sitting on the couches and enjoying the live music was another plus and there were board games to play if you wanted to stay a while and hang out .... and spend a ton of money... but definitely was about the experience. Kind of a swanky feel."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  I was a little concerned with mixed reviews.  We had a great meal and drinks.  We are going again tonight, so hoping for another great experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere here. I thought the portions were small for the money, but it is Chandler.

We really enjoyed our creative beverages. Don't shy away from the special of the day."}
{"text":"We work in an office and usually order from local places and we decided to give this place a try, the menu looked good enough. So...we ordered 2 of the bacon blue burgers and one tuna melt for carry out.  First off they don't write anything on the boxes so we got to guess which one was cooked medium and which one was medium well (we guessed wrong). As I'm sitting there eating my coworkers sinful overly cooked burger I hear a shriek and the girl who had the tuna melt found a freaking metal screw in it.....no lie, a sharp metal screw that she had to spit out.  I want to believe deep down that it wasn't put in there on purpose but where in a kitchen would you have loose screws laying around that could just fall into the tuna....first and last time we order at this merchant of death restaurant. Two stars only because the \"awesome\" fries are actually pretty awesome.

Update: they were nice enough to give us a $50 gift card to make up for their attempted murder, 4stars!"}
{"text":"I met a couple of friends there. We all have a happy hour specials and it was all very good. We sat on the couch and was very enjoyable sitting outside as the weather was just right. I would return here without hesitation"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. I love the atmosphere. Cool concept. Service was TERRIBLE...food was ok. I was just amazed that the service was so bad and they were not busy. 
We got our flat bread pizza's and they forgot the fondue appetizer. We figured we would just do without. Oh wait, here it comes after about 20 min of eating. We never got our water. 
We will try somewhere else on our next visit."}
{"text":"I have been to the Living room on a couple of occasions, but I will not be going back after today. We turned up at 11am and waited 10 minutes to be seated, despite no-one being in front of us, and the place being more than half empty. We weren't shown to a table, more like directed to an area. We then waited another 10 mins until we were bought menus and ordered drinks. We ordered food at 11:25, one entree each, nothing complicated. At 11:50 the Waiter came out and apologized, saying the kitchen was 'slammed' and the food would be right out. Our food arrived at 12:15. All the time that we waited there was a singer, complete with guitar and amp, that we were sitting 25 feet away from. She didn't need an amp, because she had a powerful voice, but it was deafening, and it was impossible to hold a conversation without shouting. What should have been a relaxing Sunday Brunch turned into a mutated night out with each of us shouting at each other to be heard, and appallingly bad service. I left feeling very disappointed, and very unlikely to return. Such a shame, because one friend had driven up from Old Town to be with us. The food was tasty, but overpriced, and even with a reduction that they gave us because of the snail like service, it was still expensive. Overall a very disappointing brunch that I find very difficult to recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I've only been here for their weekend brunch, I gotta say. its the best of the best. They have one of the best deals for free flowing mimosas in town. This is a must visit spot for anyone trying to have a relaxing weekend meal. The secret here is they have multiple menus. You can ask for their Mexican menu that has amazing tacos or their breakfast which surprised me with the amount of food you get. I ordered their crepes and got the swiss and mushroom one. Delicious. They were constantly giving attention and refilled constantly. Will be going back."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Monday night and really enjoyed ourselves. We sat outside the \"the living room'\" enjoyed the flat bread, bruchescetta and a bottle of vino. My mother was cold, do the server brought her a blanket...What service! We stayed for two hours."}
{"text":"Love it! My husband and I just moved from Kirkland, WA and discovered this hip place in our backyard. We refer it as the new Vovina's (our favorite spot to frequent in Kirkland). Love the wine selection, cool music, hip setting - just a very cool vibe"}
{"text":"If you are staying in a nearby hotel, this place will make you feel welcome. Kelly the bartender is friendly, menu has many great items and it's cozy/comfortable."}
{"text":"This rating is for brunch only. Stick to dinner and happy hrs because the breakfast food is not worth it at all. Nice ambience and mango mimosa is delicious."}
{"text":"We (me and husband) are pretty happy with the location of this new wine bar, since it's within bike-riding distance from our house. The decor is nice, cool patio with couches, full bar and a nice little menu. 

We met some friends there last Friday night thinking it would be semi-quiet since it just opened, but it was pretty busy, not complaining, I'm happy places around here are busy. 

The only thing is it was packed with cougars, cougars acting like 20-year-olds, so not really our thing. But maybe it will calm down after it's open a little longer, crossing our fingers, we really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I asked the waitress if she had any red blends and she had no idea what I was talking about. Sent over the bartender and he recommended a few.  We snacked on chips and queso, sliders, turkey wraps...all very good.  Pretty empty on a Friday night but I hear it gets packed."}
{"text":"I see why they are giving away food on Facebook now. This place used to be so good-not to mention super busy. We got there at about 5:00 on a Saturday, which in the past would've meant a wait. The place was a ghost town and that really should've told us all we needed to know. Sat straight away and were rushed to get wine. We didn't get a chance to look at what the menu offered since things had changed. The waitress suggested Bogle Essentials for a blend. I guess, there's three of us so a bottle. Nothing fancy right? $32 for that lovely variety. No wonder she pushed that right on us and didn't give us a chance at the menu options. That's our fault for falling for that trick. So for the food. It was just sad. The bruschetta used to be so good. Now it just tasted like straight from the jar premade crap. The chicken salad was clearly not made on site and lacked any flavor. There wasn't an ounce of care put into that board. They were bored with their board. So we tried the \"Big Board\" a delightful pleasure to feast your eyes on of meats, cheeses, nuts, olives....now if you had really small hands like someone it would look \"Big.\" And again...a mixed bag of store bought junk. And by store we were not even treated to something from AJ's. Man...this place used to be so awesome."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed in this place. The oysters were not served on Ice they were served just on a tray where they got warm. I was in on a Thursday afternoon at 4 and the music was so loud I had to yell to talk to the waitress and I asked her to turn the music down and she said it's the environment that they're trying to create, a club atmosphere. I would not recommend this place at all it was noisy the waitress was unprofessional she wasn't even concerned that the fact that neither one of us could hear anything over the music. And so we had our oysters and finished our wine and left. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times. The prices are ok, just average to other places around town.  The happy hour menu doesn't offer anything to our taste and the prices are high for the quantity of food we have seen on the plates that pass by our table. The reason for the lower rating is that the front windows face the west and therefore you are watching the sunset.  THE WINDOWS ARE FILTHY!!!!! It looks as if they haven't been washed since the first day the place opened......are you kidding?  Are they cheap to find a window washer? It makes you wonder how clean the rest of the restaurant is.  Actually my husband was served a glass of wine the other night that still had lipstick on it  :( most bartenders watch for this and clean the glasses before putting them away!"}
{"text":"So what if I'm a cougar!  Young cubs will get eaten!  ha-ha!  The LR is what's up!  The food was better this time than it was the last, and the last time wasn't too shabby.
I really love the atmosphere and it's a place I really feel relaxed.  The music is not loud!  Who the heck is saying that?  A cub I'm sure! LOL!

Keep up the good work LR.  Our waitresses have been nothing but sweet and kind."}
{"text":"Well I tried this place with my mom a few months ago, and I wasn't impressed at all. The idea is fun, but the food wasn't great especially for the prices."}
{"text":"Came here looking for french food at the Ici Bistro. Found the Living Room instead!

-- Had the Foie Gras and the Steak Tartare. Both outstanding!
-- Dining room ambience is very cozy.
-- Great wine selection.
-- Price was in the upper range, but well worth it!

Next time I am in Toronto, I will consider staying at their hotel."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here. Its a great atmosphere, however, the waitstaff acts as if they are doing me a favor by taking and giving me my order. We sat in the middle of the restaurant. I qas asked twice to scoot my chair in. Its not a good place to put a chair. The food was ok, and the portionswere small. I got the bruscetta.... ehh.  I think i will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews from other yelp members I have to agree with them. I'm not going to go into detail, I'm just going to give a quick summary. We were at the place at 7pm on a Friday. If you want  table, they will be hard to find.

1) Wine - I had a Cabernet - It was good but not spectacular. I'm sure that it was an honest pour, but for some reason, it seemed less that other places. 
2) Bruschetta - Fair. Outside was nice and crunchy while the center was soggy. (Other reviews had similar comments.)
3) Service - Was not spectacular. The waitresses seemed pre-occupied with other things. It seems that we were not the priority of her evening.
4) Music - Way too loud. We were not able to talk without yelling across the tables. Very annoying. Although the DJ was pretty good with a great selection of music.

I was really hoping to give this place better reviews. If you like this place, you will love Postino's."}
{"text":"This is the closest wine bar to my house (33 miles but worth the drive) and is a great place to have a glass (or bottle) with friends and family. Grab a couch indoors or one of the alcoves on the patio and settle in for some wine and food. The wine list could be expanded to include some local Arizona wines but the list is affordable and a nice selection of wine grapes and styles. The flat breads are a good choice for sharing as is the Greek bruschetta and the meat and cheese board. My go to dinner choice is always the French Dip sandwich."}
{"text":"What a great brunch- the French toast was fabulous and the Chiliquilies were AMAZING-the presentation and flavors of both dishes was exceptional.  The Bloody Mary bar allowed one to flavor and garnish with abandon- even strips of bacon! The waitstaff kept our water and coffee cups filled. This was our first visit, but the presentation, flavors, and prices will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot in Chandler/ Ocotillo area. Better to go on Thursday,  Friday &/or Saturday night when the music is way better and there is a DJ. During the week pretty quite and the music they play will put you to sleep. However, the baretender ladies are so sweet and can pretty much make you anything you want based on what you feel like drinking. Overall a super chill place!"}
{"text":"The place looks pretty nice and is a casual hang out sort of place but they really don't cook any food there.  The kitchen must really be bare bones because the food is like a sandwich shop type set-up.  Really surprising given we love Humble pie up in Scottsdale where the owners hail from.  Hopefully they will get on that ASAP. Sauce is pretty good but a grown up kind of pizza joint would really kill there."}
{"text":"I called to set up an anniversary date for my husband and I. Pre-ordered the food so we could enjoy the evening without interruptions (and without money involved as it was my gift to him). Received 3 calls after to verify my request, yet still had the order incorrect upon arrival. I ignored the in-corrections and made a great night of it until I received my check clipped to a pen, without any kind of booklet. Putting my expenses of the evening out there, for my husband to see, ruined my evening and made it awkward for us. Expect to have everyone know what you paid for the evening, even though you are paying high prices, they still seem to think they can treat you like you are at Denny's. Low class guys. Get some damn check books. Seriously. Any bill over $100 deserves some discretion. Ugg. 

Great service, great atmosphere but treated like you're at Denny's by the end of the night. Yuck."}
{"text":"We went to the Herb Box for Saturday brunch, which was hardly busy at all, and after waiting for an hour to be served were starving and left. Tried the Living Room.  Was worried because crowded. Our worries were for nothing.

Entire experience was fabulous. Great couch seating, friendly staff, fast service, outdoor live music, eggs Benedict and salads to die for!! Will be back."}
{"text":"There's good and bad here.  

Good = Happy hour is pretty solid.  There's always a good crowd.  The atompshere is as good as it gets for Chandler.  Staff is pretty nice.

Bad = The tables are packed in tight.  Tight like a fat kid's waistband after a no-holds barred Golden Corral session.  Parking is bad.  You'll probably have to park by the other businesses in the complex and huff it over.  The food is mediocre at best.  

All in all if you're looking for a happy hour spot to start the night, you could do worse.  If you're looking for a meal, head elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming to the Happy Hour here since we moved into the area.  They sushi and light cocktails are delicious.  I particularly like the blueberry martini.  My husband says they always have quality beers on tap as well."}
{"text":"$12 bottomless mimosas with entree order. We sat on the patio outside and absolutely enjoyed our time there. The food was really solid and everyone in our party enjoyed it. They regularly came by to keep our mimosas filled and didn't rush us out. There was even some wonderful live music to usher in our Sunday afternoon. Such a great spot, once the news gets out it there won't be many open tables left."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here two days in a row. After we tried it on Saturday, we had to come back Sunday. It was just that good! 

Originally, we decided to try The Living Room on Saturday because another restaurant stopped serving breakfast at 11am. Lucky for us, the Living Room serves brunch on Saturday and Sunday starting at 9am. The breakfast menu has roughly 10 entrees plus some drinks and sides. I decided to try the French toast with pecans and maple cream. My husband went with the rancher's plate (two eggs, sausage patties, polenta, and bread). We also ordered a side of bacon to share and I ordered a vanilla latte. First and foremost, the latte was amazing. Upon first sip, I exclaimed how great it was and shocked my husband. (I will admit, I am a bit of a coffee snob and it is so hard to find a place that has both great coffee and great breakfast. The Living Room has both. This is a major win in my book.) 

As for our entries, my French toast was amazing. There were 4 huge slices of bread dusted with powdered sugar and topped with pecans. It also came with a small pot of maple whipped cream and maple syrup on the side. The toast itself was extremely rich and creamy. The center was soft like bread pudding and melted in my mouth. My husband loved it as well and kept stealing bites. My husband's plate was just as good. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage was extremely tasty, and the polenta was great dipped the egg yolk. The bacon was delicious as well. I thought it could have been a bit crispier, but my husband loved it. 

When we came back Sunday, I ordered the French toast again and my husband tried the chilaquiles with a side of bacon. Both of us also ordered vanilla lattes. One of the waiters recognized us from our previous trip and was extremely friendly. When our lattes arrived, the server asked how the latte was and explained the owner/manager is a coffee enthusiast and wants to ensure everything tastes great. We gushed how great everything was and I even ordered a latte to go when we were on our way out. 

On top of brunch, The Living Room also serves lunch/dinner and we will have to check that out. However, as far as brunch goes, we had a great experience both times. The food was delicious, the coffee was tasty, and the wait staff was super friendly and helpful. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new great brunch spot. I will definitely be back and soon!"}
{"text":"Good food/drinks...good atmosphere, but the music is waaay too loud to have a good conversation.  I like the indoor/outdoor concept."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends and had the prime rib sliders, the Korean lettuce cups, and artichoke dip. Overall the food wasn't bad but I will probably never opt to go here again. I mean it's not terrible but I think the food was somewhat disappointing considering the price, and it was super LOUD. I felt like I was almost yelling to talk to my friend across from me.
Pros- helpful staff, comfy seating, interesting menu choices
Cons- Loud music and even louder drunk people, ok food, overpriced"}
{"text":"A very hip and chic place to chill have cocktails with friends :) we sat outside on the porch and enjoyed the natural weather. Good service and decent food :) on Friday night and Saturday night they have live band performing . We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here :)"}
{"text":"Visited at night for drinks and dessert, also in the morning for Brunch. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The menu was simple not overwhelming which is great.

Both times we went service was good, the donut hole dessert is awesome you can inject the filling of Bavarian, chocolate, or jelly. The donut was warm and and crisp with perfect amount of cinnamon sugar. 

For brunch I ordered the chicken and waffles and we shared nutella banana crepe. The chicken was OK, the waffle needed to be crisper,  and the breading just peeled off from the chicken and if you eat the chicken naked without the breading there is no flavor. Probably better if they had seasoned the chicken breast then breaded and fried it. 

I'm giving them the 4 stars because of the service, and the donut holes!"}
{"text":"Very hip decor and atmosphere. Excellent appetizers and a fabulous wine selection. For wine this is the place in the East Valley. 

Now if we can just get them to put in that smoking area."}
{"text":"I visited The Living Room tonight for the first time after hearing a lot about it from several of my friends. Upon approach I noticed the exterior is well kept and seems classy; when you walk in, it's spacious with a a very nice, warm decor (evidently it was recently remodeled and it looks great). The atmosphere is very inviting.
I sat down with my friends at the community high top table in the center and we were greeted almost immediately, from that point on the service went down. We informed the young lady that greeted us that we weren't sure which wine we'd like yet so we would take water for the time being. The water never came but by the time she returned we were ready to order wine and appetizers. 
The bruschetta, sliders, and the pretzel we ordered came out very quickly (we actually ordered them all at separate times throughout the evening and each time the quick delivery time was equally impressive).
The biggest problem was finding a server to even notice that we needed to order food and/or drinks. Each time our glasses sat empty, pushed off to the side for a minimum of 5 minutes before anyone would even acknowledge us and inquire as to whether or not we would like more, despite the fact that we were constantly being passed by servers. The servers seem to share the entire restaurant and I think that creates confusion as to who has or has not been helped; they just assume that someone else is taking care of you.

To recap, I'll just say that the food was delicious, much better deserving of a four star rating, and their wine selection was equally good. The service, however, is a major detractor and in my opinion is the most important part of any good dining experience. As Benjamin Franklin said, \"The handshake of the host, determines the flavor of the roast,\" and I've had much better service at Postino's or D-Vine."}
{"text":"I love this place. For the ones that have made this their local gathering place (I'll presume you agree), it's like walking into your very own CHEERS bar.  Everyone does know my name and hugs are from staff as well as regulars...their is no such thing as being in a bad mood here.  I'm just sayin."}
{"text":"While we were there we had the antipasto board and spinach dip.  Though somewhat overpriced they were good decisions. I'm no wine connoisseur, but they have a sufficient list of quality wines. The ambiance is so-so. Acoustics are somewhat poor with music in the background and no relief coming from the open ceiling. The happy hour specials are pretty good, especially on beer, and they had promotional drinks that were complementary. I would put this in a 3.5 star category if that were an option."}
{"text":"My husband and I took one of his out of town work colleagues here for a nice meal. They only had one kind of rum. And then brought my husband and the colleague their drinks and said to enjoy them because they are now out of both of them. So the colleague ordered Captain Morgan as a second drink and was brought a glass of clear liquid (supposed to be amber colored so was either the wrong drink or very watered down).  Then he ordered a salad and though the menu says you can order a half salad, the one he wanted only came as a whole. Then the waitress took both tabs to be rung up separately (for expense purposes) and put them both on my husband's card. So our friend got a receipt with our card info. She had to run it again and it took a week to come off pending on our account. Needless to say we were embarrassed to bring him there and we doubt we will return."}
{"text":"I won't be going to The Living Room again.

Our server couldn't remember who got what so we had to tell her.  Five salads how hard is that?  Write it down.

Kale Ceasar salad, no meat, not worth the $11.  The salad was loaded with salt and for the price not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Awesome bachlorette party venue. Not only were the food and drinks moderately priced for non-happy hour/Friday night, but they let us bring our own cake and joined in on our fun. We had a spot on the patio which had nice curtains to block out the wind and rain. Though it was a bit chilly at first, they went and pinned the curtains even more and it helped tremendously. They also had heaters on the patio which was great since it was in the 40s last night. Our server was a sweetheart and took really good care of us. Even though it was a busy Friday night, the crowd was fun and the music was good. We had an amazing night at The Living Room."}
{"text":"Great wine bar! The atmosphere and ambiance was very friendly and casual. They have a lot of tables, couches, comfortable chairs etc. The bruschetta was excellent as well. The waitress we had was very attentive and made sure to keep checking in on us. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"So I'm giving three stars because they failed to mention that their kitchen was shut down for renovation when we called inquiring if we needed reservations. Also they had no real bathrooms, only port o potties. We had a nice time regardless but we would have chosen a different location for celebrating my birthday had we of known it was under that much construction. They had a small menu of items that could be made during their renovation... We had the awesome fries and they were definitely awesome!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's a great spot for a loungey drink indoors or on the patio, they have pretty good food and great service. I love the vibe and they have heat lamps and blankets if it gets too cold. One of my favorite places for cocktails and the decor is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Girls Brunch turned into Lunch and Linner.  We sat outside and the weather was Amazing.  We had the Bloody Mary which is a meal in a glass and then switched to bottomless Mimosas.  Around lunch there was live music and our servers came by to refill often and just let us sit and enjoy ourselves.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, live music, outdoor seating couches (when it's not too hot.) Overall a great place. Menu is not overwhelming but quite a variety to pick from. We have been many times and will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Great open air bar with exceptional ambience and great tunes. The food menu, including apps could be a bit more creative.  It's a great way to unwind and spend relaxing evening with friends. Upscale!"}
{"text":"Decor - good, food - good, service not so good but the music was so LOUD (even on the patio) we ate and left before our eardrums burst!"}
{"text":"Super fun, upbeat environment! My friend recommended it, and I highly recommend going here. I'll be back with more people next time. The sangria and James brown were our drinks and they were excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've tried many things on their menu and have never been disappointed. It's a little pricy, but I usually go there with the idea that I'm going to split a bunch of small plates with another person or two. The living room has a fun atmosphere and a great wine selection!"}
{"text":"02/04/10

Happy hour w/ Violeta.  Loved the furniture (dark wood and slightly reminiscent of old Mission churches or Spanish villas that one may find back home- I'm from the Philippines), and the ambience.  I liked how the doors/paneling opened up to a patio- it was a little chilly that afternoon, but I imagine that w/ the perfect weather we have now, happy hour at TLR would FEEL nice.  What I did not like about the LR is that it was NOISY.  Now, I didn't mind so much that the music selections were eclectic (country to jazz to classic rock, and even Motown); After all, we were AT The Living Room, and, as in different households, one can find different music playing.  No, it was just too noisy.  I'd hate to imagine what conversing would be like if the doors opening up to the patio were closed...  What I also noticed was that while there were smatterings of all age groups (there were even children running around in the patio!), most of the people there were in their mid-40s to mid-50s.  I usually check out happy hours at restaurants for the food offered, and not to meet potential love interests, and this venue would definitely be somewhere I'd just go for the food MYSELF.  I can't even picture being able to do some work on my laptop here... maybe it'll be different in a few months?

Service was a little bit lacking, but the place was packed!  A chair was even taken from our table (I didn't mind, but I think V. did, since she was keeping her fingers crossed that her hubby would join us).  As for the food, we were going to keep it light by ordering bruschetta.  (I knew that TLR was affiliated w/ Scottsdale's 5th & Wine, and I had tried and enjoyed the bruschetta there.)  The bread pieces here were sliced much thicker than those at 5th, and while they may have reminded me of Postino's bruschetta, the flavors, while good enough that I enjoyed the dish, made me wish I was at Postino's, or even at 5th & Wine.  Especially when it was so noisy we had to raise our voices to hear each other; Violeta wasn't enjoying the music; and children were running around not two feet away from me.

I would like to give TLR another chance, and hopefully, my guests and I will find a younger crowd (no children present, please!) to enjoy the ambience, music, and food with."}
{"text":"We visited The Living Room after a bad experience at Kokopelli.  This was my first visit.  The energy, music, decor and customer service is above average.   The kitchen was closed so we will return and check out their menu very soon.  This would be a much better choice if you are looking for a wine bar in Chandler."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple:
Music is WAY, WAY too loud (and I am in my 30's) . . . . People will try it once for the novelty, but won't come back because they know they'll have to scream over dinner.   Note to the restaurant:  Let people talk as they eat, and then turn it up after 8:30pm for partiers.  
One of the \"part-owners\" who doubled as our server was really patronizing and rude to me during a few interactions.  It was the first time EVER that I didn't leave a tip (and I used to be a waitress, meaning that you pretty much have to spit in my food for me NOT to leave you a tip).  No, he did not spit in my food, but he was pretty, darn rude.  I'll just leave it at that.      
Food is NO WHERE near the quality of a Postino's.  
Bottom-line: I would genuinely love, love, love places like this to survive because I live around here and want a more unique dining experience, but this place left a bad place in my mouth.  
Go if your curiosity beckons, but go ready to SHOUT over dinner."}
{"text":"Giving three stars because the food was less than average. Definitely wouldn't come back to eat only to drink. Would give them five stars for the atmosphere and service. We loved the heaters outside on the patio and they offer blankets (My favorite cashmere ones from Costco) to anyone who needs one. Nice touch. The vibe is great if you want to hang out and have a drink or two. Music selection is hip and upbeat. The food......so disappointing. We started with Bang Bang Shrimp as an appetizer, they were super fishy and mostly just breading. I got the green chili burger and the only thing exciting about it was the brioche bun. The meat was dry and honestly I would rather have had a burger from In N Out. The Steak Frites definitely wasn't worth $22, the pesto was great, but the meat was burned and they give you 5 very thinly sliced pieces probably equivalent to 4oz of meat. Pizza cookie tasted like old cookie dough, Hershey's syrup and cheap ice cream. Don't get it."}
{"text":"I tried The Living Room, which is the restaurant inside the Windsor Arms hotel in the Yorkville area because it was part of the Winterlicious offering.  It stood out to me because it was advertised as a restaurant with a fully vegan menu.  Well, I'm not vegan but I was up for a different Winterlicious menu and thought that it could be a more healthy option.  

I reserved for 8 people initially and put down my credit card to confirm.  My event gained so much interest that I wanted to expand my reservation to 16, but I was told that this wasn't possible because there wasn't space.  Okay, that's fine I thought since it is during the Winterlicious event after all.  I came to dinner thinking it will be a packed night but turns out the entire restaurant is empty!  By the end of the night, our group was the only ones in the restaurant.  It was like they didn't even want our business.  

The waiters were nice and polite and the food came out in a timely fashion after the orders were placed.  I did notice that one of the waiters was a little sloppier at placing the food, and although I normally wouldn't care I do have a higher standard when it comes to fine dining.  The food itself was very good, but I noticed that it wasn't what I was expecting, which was a fully vegan menu.  Actually, most of the menu was non-vegan and there was one vegan option for each course.  I was confused by the Winterlicious description, but I was okay with this and thought the beef rib was fantastic."}
{"text":"Good happy hour place. Love the indoor and outdoor seating options. Good happy hour spot for after work. Haven't tried a weekend night, but from other review I might just skip this place on the weekend."}
{"text":"My first visit was for my friends birthday and it was during the weekend Happy Hour. It's nice to have  a place on this  side of town~ Great selection of wines at half price until 6pm. I tried a few Reds and they were great! The atmosphere was relaxing, long bar tables and a cozy couches and low chairs and a large open patio w comfy cushioned divans. Guests and staff were not too \"Snottsdaleish\".Staff was very freindly and attentive service.  People dressed nice but casual. I didn't have a chance to try any food but the bruchetta plates looked fresh as well as the sandwiches eaten by several in our party.. I will definately be back to try the menu soon."}
{"text":"Great place for glass of wine and some apps.  We met some friends here early as it does get crowded.  We order some apps and a bottle of wine.  The food was very good, flat bread pizza, prime rib sliders, anti-pasto board just great.  Good selection of wine, if you are not a wine drinker there are a handful of beers and a couple of mix drink selections.  (This is a wine bar after all).  The service was very friendly and prompt.  We will be back.

At about 7p the noise level does increase, so it does become a bit of a challenge to have a friendly conversation with your party.  The prices were not bad at all."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews for this place, and since I was in town, I thought I would check it out. The hot ticket for Happy Hour is the $5 glass of wine ... which I didn't have, but 99% of everyone else in the place did. I settled in with a Maker's Mark on the rocks (VERY liberal portions, FYI ... their single is like a double in California), and an order of two types of bruschetta (Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil, Balsamic Reduction and the  Steak, Gorgonzola, Creamy Horseradish) both of which were amazing. The place has a laid back lounge feel and is very casual. The staff was friendly and attentive, not overbearing in the least. I will be going back again for sure!  Bottom line? I walked out of there after 3 hours (they had some great live music for a Tuesday night), 3 drinks and the food for around $35. Well worth every penny IMHO. Go, try and enjoy! You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots since moving to North Scottsdale! It's great for regular dinner, as well - but I prefer to go a little earlier for happy hour and watch the sun go down on the outdoor patio. Although the indoor dining area is extremely cute and decorated with the chicest of furnishings, I always prefer the fresh air outside. At least while it's still cool enough to sit out there, that is ;)

The menu is the next best thing. The menu is pretty broad in selection, and I tend to always navigate towards the smaller dishes to share with the group so you can all get the best of both worlds. HH menu is 3-6pm on weekdays, and everything from the oysters on the Half Shell, to the sushi, spinach dip, any of the flatbreads (YUM!) and you CANNOT FORGET to get \"awesome fries\" with added creamy Brie. I'm salivating just thinking about it. For reals. A must order! 

The main dinner menu is also a home run. Any of these are recommended: lamb chop lollipop, steak salad, fondue, tuna melt, French dip, & the sliders are always a hit! You really can't go wrong with the menu. 

They also have an outstanding wine selection! I always go with a group, so we'll save some money and get some bottles, but they also offer by the glass. Champagne, sangria, red/white/rose, take your pick! :) They also offer beer (tap/bottle) if wheat is your thing + a full bar with some fun cocktails! If you have some room left for a sweet treat, try the donut holes (they're injected with your choice of flavors - try the Bavarian cream & sweet berry). 

The scene is always pretty lively, so there's rarely a dull atmosphere. Everyone is always lookin pretty snazzy, too. Beautiful people with a beautiful scene (and food!). Oh, and the waiters are always on point, no joke. Verrrry nice and extremely attentive. Goes a long way, in my book! 

If you end up staying past hh when the sun goes down, you might even get an earful of live music with a dj spinning. This really brings the place to life. 

Great chill spot! Enjoy."}
{"text":"To sum it up, this place was just not the place for me. Maybe I am just a fuddy duddy, but it seems that the clientele are cougar-like women, aged 30-50, with bleached hair and sequin tops. I expected a quiet wine bar, but instead it is more like a loud night club.

The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole \"we-wish-we-were-a-club\" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.

Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. 

Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like \"uh, I kind of want to order too\"

Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating. Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud. They had a DJ playing music so loud, having a conversation was impossible (and we ended up sitting pretty far from the speakers!). We left a soon as we finished our dinners (didn't stay for more wine or dessert) because the music was just too annoying."}
{"text":"if you haven't been here, I highly suggest you check it out. the employees are so kind!!! the interior is to die for and so is the fondue. I would go here every night if I could .... yum"}
{"text":"Hey, I think Chandler might be growing up and leaving its' farming roots behind. The Living Room is certainly Chandler's grown up side. I met up with friends for happy hour and I was not the only one looking for some grown up good times in Chandler. The lounge is open, nicely lit but lacks a little in the noise department, it gets loud with just a few people. 

The food and drink choices are well presented. The bruchetta choices are great and the wine selection is very nicely thought out - want a glass of sparkling, a pinto grigio, a choice in whites and reds, done! A great happy hour and will be added to my regular rotation."}
{"text":"So. Where do I start. I am very disappointed. I ordered the flat bread pizza. Horrible. It was so dry and little especially for the price and on top of that, it wasn't even the one that I ordered.  I sat outside which was okay but the whole time I was outside, my waitress only checked on me once and that was just to bring the bill. The bathroom situation is ridiculous. \"An upgraded port a potty\" is what they called it. I really expected a lot more from this place, but that's my fault for having high expectations."}
{"text":"I just moved to Chandler and tried this on a Sunday....awful!   Only a few tables busy on a Sunday, that tells you something.   I ordered the steak salad and it was awful.   The salad contained a few pieces of chewy and bland steak.  The lettuce was wilted with dressing and a few cherry tomatoes.  My friend ordered the small organic salad and a bruschetta.  Neither of us ate our food.  I was charged $3 for my club soda but did get them to remove it.  My friend was overcharged $4 also.   
The service was the worse.   No one refilled our drinks, no service utensils were given.  The menu and venue look great but service and food are everything and they are awful at both."}
{"text":"Great place to have happy hour with friends. Love the menu and drink choices. This location has been many different things over the years, hoping the Living Room is here to stay."}
{"text":"I'm giving The Living Room three stars not because the food wasn't good because it was actually very good.  Not because the atmosphere was bad because it was really lovely and very beautifully done. But because the DJ in the corner was playing the music so loud that you had to shout to one another to try and have conversation. Even asked the server and she said they would not lower the volume!! The atmosphere did not lend itself to a DJ but would have been so much nicer to have a single guitarist playing some nice mellow music after all it is suppose to be like in your \"living room!\""}
{"text":"I brought a group of 10 here for drinks and a light dinner.  The service was great and the environment was awesome.  We sat outside and enjoyed the comfortable space.  I wish the food options were a bit more robust but we enjoyed what we had.  The service was good - welcoming and  attentive throughout the night. Nice place."}
{"text":"Obnoxious loud music. The owners obviously have no clue what their business model actually is. Why would you set up quaint little living rooms within the living room for your customers if they can't hear each other talking? Isn't that what a wine bar is supposed to be? A place to relax with friends? I don't find it relaxing to have to scream to my friend who is sitting exactly 1 foot away from me. If we wanted to be assaulted with deafening, dreadful music we can go to a dance club. We asked the waitress to have them turn down the music and she screamed at me \" YEAH, OTHERS HAVE ASKED TOO. I'LL TELL THEM AGAIN!\" Very disappointing experience. They might want to figure out your business model."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times, ok wine list-pricey. NOISY!! You cannot carry a normal conversation, asked the owner to turn music down but he just ignores you, probably because he is usually have lit.  Food st ok but expensive for what it is.  If you go, Sunday seems to be the only day they won't try to blow your ear drums out.  Nope I am not an old guy, I just like to talk to folks in a normal tone vs. screaming"}
{"text":"Enjoyable atmosphere.
Great place to meet friends and for light meals"}
{"text":"We've visited this place several times and haven't been disappointed once! They have it figured out; from service that makes you feel special to the great quality of wine and food options. Enjoyed watching the near seamless handoff and transition of servers to having Sebastian who provided excellent service and food recommendations. We'll be opening a Winery down the street in Oct 2015 and look forward to building a strong partnership with this fine establishment. Looking forward to future visits and checking out their original site on Chandler. Keep up the awesome work! Wishing you nothing but great success"}
{"text":"I've been coming here about once a month for the last 4 months or so. The new manager Dave is fantastic! Dave and Hannah are assets to this establishment. In all selfishnes, I hope they never leave Living Room Ocotillo! They both work hard and also truely try to make their customers happy.
Overall, this establishment has gotten better and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I heart The Living Room for so many reasons... great food, wine, comfy seating and great service! Over and over. Have been a few times and they never fail to satisfy! And a lot of deals and music on Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place we've ate at twice now and it wasn't good. I had the chicken salad sandwich today. It was not good at all, bread hard around edges, but that I can deal with, the chicken was also hard and not good quality meat. The hostess agreed with me that it was not good either. Just a bland sandwich and I would never get again. Needs to be taken off the menu!! I gave two stars for the French fries, the only thing I've had that's good there!"}
{"text":"Great place to get together with friends, great drinks and tapas.  Everything from sports, music,jenga and board games. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love The Living Room! Two visits so far and we were not disappointed. Great vibe/decor, food, drinks, and service on both occasions. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The music was also fantastic. The patio is large and inviting. Our out of town guest, who is a well traveled foodie, can't wait to return! Note that this is a wine bar/cafe and the menu reflects this as it is geared towards apps/finger food with a bit of a twist/drinks. We love the overall ambiance and will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Live music is amazing. Bottomless mimosas are a steal. Service was exceptional, especially Carol and Alex!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service, thank you! Great wines and loved the edamame and shrimp cocktail. Took care of me with a to go order. Music was too loud for me but I am sure others loved it. Thanks all."}
{"text":"Always a good experience whenever we go here. The food is delicious. The drinks are yummy. I knocked it one star because the service can be a little slow since they are normally crowded, and if you sit inside, it gets really loud making it hard to hold a conversation. (Why does the acoustic guitar player need to hooked into an amplifier?)

I love this place in the winter months, requesting a seat out on the patio under a heater."}
{"text":"I think this place is a lot of fun.  It's in a nice complex that's not your standard strip mall.

I've been 2x and both times were fun for dates.  They had live music...and a good wine & beer selection (not just bud light).

I have not had too much food so will not comment.

The atmosphere is cool -  sofa and chairs, a bar...or standard tables.  but, it's a funky cool place.............and we just don't get that too much in Chandler."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Atmosphere was around par. Service and Wine were both below par. 

So, you're really just paying for the atmosphere. 

I'd prefer to pay the same for a glass of wine at a place where all three are above par.

The wine they serve is overpriced for its quality. They seem to buy very cheap bottles and then charge 8 to 14 dollars a glass. Service was pretty blah; our waitress didn't know her wines, and didn't seem to have much social grace. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. 

Ideally, service should meld with the atmosphere. The atmosphere (the best part) is causal but also easily intimate or open and friendly and fun depending on where you sit; our service did not contribute to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous.  Sat at the bar and the bartenders were pleasant and attentive.  They made great margaritas!  Had the Prime Rib and Bruschetta.  Excellent!!!  The flatbread pizza was not good though.  It was unappetizing and small.  Other than our experience was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff....mediocre food. Great place for drinks and hanging out skip the food head out to many of the other area great restaurants as food is NOT the Living Room's strong suit."}
{"text":"I joined my friends at The Living Room for our monthly meeting.  Since this was my first visit, perhaps my expectations were too high?  The wine list was short, the food was bland, the service was just okay -(for a party of 10.)"}
{"text":"Being from out of town this place was a little tricky to find at night.  With that being said, the inside was decorated beautifully unique.  The wait staff was very friendly and made great recommendations on wine and cocktails.  

I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp lettuce cups and they were so delicious.  I wasn't starving, so it was the perfect amount of food.  The shrimp was moderately spicy and balanced perfectly by the slaw and herbs on top.  My husband's prime rib sliders were very different and tasty.  He preferred them with the au jus dipping sauce over the horseradish sauce.

The icing on the cake was the injectable donut hole dessert.  Such a tasty and different dessert.  The donut holes were fried to perfection and they came out with 3 syringes of sauces: chocolate, bavarian cream and jelly.  The jelly was my favorite and it was fun to experiment with different filling combinations.  

Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend and figured I'd try it out. My first time there I had probably one of the best kale Caesar salads I've ever had before. I found myself craving it last night so went there again. This time along with the bomb kale Caesar i ordered the awesome fries--I know fries are fries but these were legit ass fries and whatever sauce that came with them was legit too. Ended the night licking the bottom of the pan our pizza cookie came in . Overall cute atmosphere, good food/wine and great service!"}
{"text":"Once again I have only good things to say about
The Living Room Wine Bar & Cafe in Market
Street in Scottsdale.   Today, Mother's Day they
were much busier than they could imagine.  But
as always each & every one on staff was excellent
and near-by to get another drink or whatever we
might want.  Brunch also was excellent, as their
menu items always are.
The main reason to write about The Living Room
@ DC Ranch today is because around 3:00
or slightly before a young woman walked onto
the Patio, she had planned a 30 - 40 person
party.  As the Brunch crowd was mostly leaving
the staff was getting ready & set up tables & chairs for the party.  But it was not satisfactory
to the young woman.  She had her own plan about staging the area also flowers & balloons
for each table.  Also she required a table for photos & flowers etc.  The servers and bussers
were moving tables & chairs, finding tablecloths
all sorts of things one would normally rent a place
for and pay a set up fee for.  But this is not that
kind of place.   There are private groups &
company affairs, bridal & baby showers there all
the time, but not one I can recall that required
Special positioning or set up like this one.  There
is no private room and customers were sitting most everywhere.
Robert, Travis & Rick were doing so many things 
They went far above their job description.
No other similar place in any area & any state
would hv done near as much without extra pre
arranged fees. See why i love this place, i certainly would never do anything like this..,,
but they took it all with a great attitude and without a complaint.
Again stop in at The Living Room @ DC Ranch"}
{"text":"The Living Room in Chandler, Az is changing
and for the betterDave, the company's traveling overseer for managing and ideas to
promote these fun Wine Bars & Cafe's, is fantastic.   Sooo friendly & accommodating to all
customers. Tom Kaufman and the people who
partner with him in all the businesses he owns
seem to have a great eye what the demographics 
of each area want.  Whether the food, wine, music or atmosphere.  When it's time to alter
a particular place they are on it and do it...,Dave
is the guy to do it.  
The staff also makes an impact on what and
why people return..., from the manager of each
establishment.   We drove the 40 minutes from
Scottsdale, where generally you wil find us.  Mike
who had been at The Living Room on Market Street.  
After only a day or 2 the servers and bartenders
and everyone there agreed Miky is #1 in listening
& learning and really fitting in immediately with them and the patrons 
We loved him in Scottsdale now everyone in
Chandler will also? . 
Love you Mike & we'll take the loooong drive to
see you again, in Chandler"}
{"text":"Probably best late night, not happy hour or dinner. Sitting in sofas is more comfortable then-can't recommend sitting at their tables, they were sticky and had old bits of food encrusted on them. Wine list has a few very good names on it priced very well. Food is excellent and seems to be made with care and with high quality ingredients. Service is soooo slooow and they didn't care about the slowness or even their accuracy. Even the simplest request took 10 minutes, food took about 30 minutes. They left the wrong thing at our table and they did fix it, but seemed perplexed that I would be annoyed I had the wrong thing. I guess I was harshing their vibe. Definitely more of a late night attitude and environment."}
{"text":"Second visit to this place and I love it. I love wine bars. The environment of this place alone deserves 5 stars. The service gets better each time you go. The food is \"Oh so tasty.\" Wine is spectacular and I love me some Pomegranate Martinis. If you haven't been to The Living Room, you better make a trip out there soon. The 27th of this month is their 1 Yr Anniversary and they are planning an all day Happy Hour. Relax and enjoy what this place has to offer."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this sushi place that I had been trying to get my wife to go to.  She bought the Groupon!?  But we had just had sushi.  So, naturally, we drove there and ended up at The Living Room.  They seemed rather busy for a Thursday night, so we opted to sit outside, immediately.  The sun was low and the misters were raining down cool moisture.  Two chairs were arranged around an end table and, later, a second end table was added.  I hope you see where this is going.  It actually felt as if we were eating dinner at a party in someone's living room.  The service seemed good when you accounted for the deluge of patrons.  I'm not sure if this was a typical Thursday.  I saw our waitress hustling inside and outside with plates and cutting boards being used as plates.  We had some wine, the olive appetizer, and four bruschetta on a cutting board.  All was good.  The menu is long on the wine and beer, and boasts a variety of appetizers, bruschetta, salads, sandwiches, and desserts.  Near the end of our dinner, the music turned county and we hightailed it out of there."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I have ever received in my entire life. I went here for the first time about a week ago and was seated at about 8:30 pm. Keep in mind the business closes at 10 so I felt were okay on time. I wasn't sure what to order right away for a drink so I ordered a water. The server came back and we ordered an appetizer of chips and guacamole. The server brought it to us and never came back. We sat there for an hour waiting for our server to come back to us! I felt as though we were getting horrible service because we were not drinking alcohol,  which is a huge money maker for this place. The server finally came back and said \"So the kitchen closes in 5 minutes did you want to order anything else?\" Very condescendingly I may add. 
Absolutely terrible first impression and I will not be returning, ever."}
{"text":"I have been to The Living Room numerous times now and every time is absolutely wonderful. I have had dined in and ordered to go so many times. The awesome fries are... Well AWESOME! The Cobb Salad is also one of my favorites! The servers are so great, very attentive..and make you feel at home! Love Love Love! :)"}
{"text":"What happened to management and all the awesome servers?!?! We sat for a good 15 minutes in a semi empty lounge and never got as much as a hello. Servers were collected around the bar/kitchen area. I have been coming here for years...sad very sad! Hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for appetizers and drinks. Service was a little slow but it was a Friday night and packed...Sangria is wonderful and the bruschetta is a must try! The prices are very reasonable and the portions are decent size. Great after work choice or fun evening out with the girls!"}
{"text":"As always the Living Room was amazing ,
Food was fantastic ,staff always on point , and I had the most awesome person taking care of me , McKenna she would get 18 Stars if I could give them.

{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in yesterday for lunch. We fell in love with the decor and overall atmosphere immediately. Upon looking at the menu we found many things that caught our attention and got us even more excited. We started with the spinach artichoke dip, we both agreed it was the best we've had. The presentation of all the food was also excellent. The green chili burger and the strawberry gorgonzola salad were both very flavorful and well balanced! We finished with the cookie a la mode for desert, obviously. Exceptional, easy going service and overall experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't quite figure out the good reviews.  Had lunch there with a friend.  Menu limited, food under par, service very spotty.  Had one of the Flatbreads...it was so thin you could see through it, cold and hard.  I am in Gainey Ranch all the time, shopping or dining at their other restaurants, and this place either has to up their game or they won't be there very long.  Isn't in the same ball park as the other eateries there."}
{"text":"When I look over a restaurant's reviews, I usually pay special attention to the bad ones.  The Living Room had enough one and two stars reviews to give me pause, but I tried it anyway.  My experience was almost five stars and it made me wonder about those poor reviews.  
The Living Room is an open, modern space with the usual tables but also some living room-like spaces where you can sit on couches if you aren't eating anything that needs a knife and fork.  On a weekday evening at 6:15 it was almost full.  Why?  Because the happy hour beer and wine prices are low enough to get people to come early, and happy hour ends at 6:00.  It's 5:45 for me from now on.
The food is basically slightly upscale comfort food.  Most dishes are small plate size but one plus a shared appetizer is enough unless you are more than averagely hungry.  Everything we had was tasty and a pleasure to eat, and other dishes we saw looked just as good.
Prices are fair, almost cheap, especially if you take advantage of happy hour and the daily specials.
The few rough edges which kept Living Room from getting 5 stars in my review were small but important:
1.  We ordered a wine that we knew well but it was a little off, probably from having been opened the day before.  The wine by the glass list is large here and I doubt they discard the leftovers at the end of the day.  They need to. I know of no wine that is just as good the second day.
2.  They brought our appetizer with the two mains (not just us, that seems to be their way).  Please don't do that.  And you'll sell more wine if you spread it out a bit.  I felt rushed.
3.  Services was efficient but brusque - you know, when you feel like the server is anxious to be on his/her way even though they don't say anything.
Hint: Weather permitting, the patio is where to sit, as the inside is just a tad noisy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this Living Room is linked to the one in Boston, but I'd have to say this location is much better than its counterpart (if it is). We came for brunch after Halloween. The food was not memorable but I really enjoyed their $5 bloody mary bar. The service was also good and I did enjoy the seating arrangements."}
{"text":"We had our daughters graduation party here in May and the whole crew was fantastic!  We had it on Saturday during brunch hours and it worked perfectly - they gave us part of the restaurant with the couches and our guests got to enjoy the Bloody Mary bar and the food was delicious.  The staff could not have been easier to work with - from planning to ordering to paying - very stress free and easy.  I highly recommend this place for events!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for National Rosé day and got a bottle of Rosé to share. It was pretty empty when we got there so we were seated promptly and since there weren't that many people it was pretty quiet, it was nice to hang out and talk at a normal sound level. The service was good, our waiter was attentive. The only complaint we had during our visit was one of my friends tried to order a latte and when she asked for milk alternatives we were informed they only have regular milk. I know this isn't a place known for their coffee, but they had an espresso machine so we assumed they would have the foresight to accommodate any coffee drinkers, even those lactose intolerant with non-dairy options."}
{"text":"Servicewas awesome and attentive. Food and drinks great. Folk rock a nice addition to my Sunday evening"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friends. Chill and hang out!!!  Couches inside and out. Food is amazing. Love the boards especially!!  Staff is super friendly and great at recommending what to get."}
{"text":"Great service!  We came on the tail end of happy hour, without even knowing about the happy hour, and our server still gave us the HH price on our wines. Such a comfy atmosphere. Great seating for all kinds of parties!  The food was just okay, so I'd recommend coming here for the happy hour and atmosphere over the food."}
{"text":"Wandered in for a drink mid-afternoon.  Hadn't been to this space in years.  Normally go to the Four Seasons or the Roof Bar at the Hyatt.  Had a very pleasant experience.  Bartender was very solicitous.  Had a bite to eat.  Good bar food: sliders and veggie rolls.  A big plus is the décor.  Reminded us of a favourite hotel bar in Mayfair in London.  We'll be back.  A tip to the hotel: improve your website.  There's not much info on this bar there."}
{"text":"Usually I don't write reviews on yelp but I felt like this was necessary. My boyfriend and I went to the living room yesterday for dinner for the first time. We ordered the cheese board (the bread was hard and stale and the fruit compote was very mediocre, not to mention ridiculously priced for what you get), prime rib French dip, and the petite organic salad... which we ended up asking for it to go because we had already finished the cheese board and my boyfriend his sandwich. We had finished and it took at least 15 minutes until a single server came outside and we had to wave him over to ask for the salad to go as well as the check. We got home and I started eating my salad to then realize that about a fourth of the lettuce was browning and some already starting to wilt and decompose. I would've given this place a 1 star but my boyfriend did say the sandwich was good so I do have to give them credit for that. I guess only go to this place if you want a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Dull and expensive.

Went for vegan brunch service with three others and found the food all together boring, over priced, and careless. Service was basic, uncaring and meh.

We ordered all of the options available at the time and no one found anything particularly good about any dish. We had all heard great things about fancy vegan brunch at the Windsor Arms, but turns out that day would not live up to our expectations. Maybe our expectations were too high, or maybe the food was crap. Who knows? Be warned if you go - it seems hit or miss.

I like the room itself, which makes it even more disappointing that I am so extraordinarily disinterested from ever returning. Oh well."}
{"text":"busy busy busy restaurant!
It's definitely a cute spot for happy hour. Not sure if I would come here for anything other than conversation. 

Came here during happy hour and resorted to sitting outside because 1. it's extremely dark inside 2. it's extremely loud inside. The servers and manager were all really nice and made conversation with us which was both nice and at times..a bit unnecessary haha 

we ordered bruschetta (like 4 orders), sliders (delicious), hummus (delicious) annnnd a bottle of wine. dont worry, there were like 15 of us. Everything was really delicious and pretty to look at. Although i was supposed to be watching what i eat, the massive intake of carbs was definitely worth it. 

parking is available everywhere in the lovely plaza"}
{"text":"I think this place is a fun after work bar. The atmosphere is fun and staff is attentive but their food is disappointing. The portions for the price are a bummer. The organic salad is so bland. There was a drizzle of flavorless dressing. The bruschetta board was yummy but for the price you get more at other places. The flat bread was good but again small portion for the price. Between my husband and I we ordered the fondu a salad bruschetta and a flatbread and we were still hungry. It's appetizers. Not dinner."}
{"text":"WoW! What an environment, this place is a Chandler icon. Outside felt California-ish - wind blowing , curtains reminded me of LL Bean catalog as well as the awning. Inside mellow, hip, music slightly loud for a one-on-one date but enjoyable. High quality clientele turnout. We were there at 9:30 pm and moderately filled on a wed, but my wife was there earlier w friends (7 pm) and it was packed. Water served in cool glass jars. 

We ordered a Root Beer Martini $8 - yummy and STRONG! Great hummus & bread (had the spicy pepper), 

Dessert a pazookie (they don't call it that for obvious reasons) didn't knock my socks off , but pretty darn good

Venue seems ideal for groups of 3-6 or so but can accommodate what looks like 10-12 is a good max size

I look forward to promoting your venue to my friends"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and had a great waiter!  The Yellow Squash soup was thick, creamy and delicious. We tried the Cheese board appetizer, very good however a little pricey. Great place to just sit, relax, converse and drink your favorite glass of wine... I prefer Pino Noir! ;~)"}
{"text":"This place is adorable with great music. I like their specialty drink The Size 0. A wonderful fresh, cucumber drink with vodka or gin. Food...ehhh, in my opinion...don't come here for the food. Do it more for the drinks. I ordered a cheese plate once and there was like NOTHING on it. It's very overpriced here for the small portions you get. Bruschetta...ehhh, not really for me, unless your STARVING and need anything to eat. The steak/cheese bruschetta was good, but you get like 3 bites worth it seems! So yes on good ambiance, yes on drinks and no on food. :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed the living room on our Friday night date night. We ordered the bang bang shrimp, a spicy sushi, spinach dip and their famous fries. Everything was plentiful and delicious along with our two adult beverages. Our server was on the spot and had a great sense of humor and took care of us quite professionally. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather and surroundings that the area provides. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is very cool. Great atmosphere, great apps, and good selection of drinks. Has a DJ that plays music, and TVs to watch the game. Get the cookie and ice cream dessert. It's the best."}
{"text":"I liked the old Living Room too but this new iteration is an impressive upgrade. Open air, comfortable patio, cool bar, throw in some some sofas - it's a very well put together and ran place. The bartenders are great.

The menu has a wide variety of wine and different kinds of food too, from burgers to sushi rolls. Everything we've tried has been pretty darned good, and the prices are practical too. Thumbs up. Try it if you're bored with some of the old school wine bars, like Kazimierz."}
{"text":"We had been awaiting the opening of this after watching the slow crash and burn of the former wine bar. We were hoping for a fresh new spot, with great service and a more extensive wine and food menu. The Living Room delivered! We stopped in last Friday night for a glass of wine and were shocked that there was a wait! They were able to squeeze us in the packed patio and we were able to enjoy our drinks there. Live DJ on the weekends is a nice touch. Service was good....needs some work but I will chalk it up to it being new and them working the kinks out! Hoping to try out some food next visit!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Living Room for afternoon cocktails with girlfriends in the past. I was never blown away while there but never disappointed either.

Today was a new experience! I needed to get lunch during a busy day and decided to get takeout from The Living Room. Well this experience \"BLEW ME AWAY\" and not in a good way! Look at the picture of my Tuna Melt! My kids can make a tuna sandwich better than the Tuna Melt I received. 

Disappointed beyond belief! Subway makes better sandwiches than this"}
{"text":"Went here again last weekend.  It was a spur of the moment choice!  The service was terrible this time around.  But the dessert wine was awesome.  Definitely try the 2006 Late Harvest Semillon, $8 for a small half-filled glass (which is expected of pricey Late Harvest wines).  My personal favorite wine is the 2006 John Anthony Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc, which they didn't have (can't seem to find it in AZ anywhere), but the '06 LH Semillon tastes very similar."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor are incredible.  The brick wall accompanied by gorgeous lighting and chandeliers is really tastefully done.  The service is friendly and attentive with multiple staff checking in on us throughout our dinner.  The manager thanked us for coming in.  We ordered the superfood salad which was sooooo good!  I will go back just for that.  The bruschetta was good.  We got the apple (great), chicken salad (my favorite), classic caprese (great) and Greek which we didn't love.  Oddly had jam mixed with the savory red peppers and goat cheese - too many flavors.   The tables are close together as the building is small.  We could over hear and partake in several conversations around us. All and all an excellent experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"A Horror Show

We went in the hopes of finding a couple of great steaks. What we got was badly prepared food, and incompetent service. Our starters were accompanied by the sides for our mains; they were cold, so we had no qualms about sending them back. 

The wine order got lost, it seems, and the bottle didn't arrive until several minutes after our mains had arrived.  

We ordered steaks for our mains ... they were awful. Bad meat, with lots of sinew and it seemed they were cooked in an Easy-Bake oven. No sear to speak of, the meat was an unappetizing shed of tawny-grey.  There was a rather tired-looking portobello mushroom on the side ...my guess is that hit had been grilled some hours earlier. 

I don't know what they are going for in this place. The prices were remarkably reasonable - suspiciously so. This fact, along with the too expansive menu leads me to wonder whether they are just tarting-up Sysco prepared foods. 

It's too bad. The room itself was very nice."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. Atrocious service. Really terrible experience. We waited on a Sunday morning for breakfast for 45 minutes. Note: we were one of only three other tables at the time and one of those tables was not eating, just having coffee.  The food was good yet expensive, certainly not amazing or anything that would offset the ridiculous wait. My husband and I both only ordered the oatmeal bowl which was $14 and was supposed to have \" berries \" included.  This was actually one strawberry and one blackberry. Laughable.  Save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great for weekend brunch and live music. Hard to find nice atmosphere, good food and great music in Scottsdale. Happy hour is always fun too. Nice and relaxed environment. Different size sofas, lounge-style chairs inside and out, fire tables and misters too. The food is above average. Marshall who has been there for a couple years and is a server is absolutely incredible and on top of everything, which is very rare to find. I will always request him, he made our time there exceptional!"}
{"text":"I came across this place recently and it's now my primary local bar. The atmosphere and ambience of this place really sucked me in.  I'm not a fan of big crowds or loud bars, and while this place gets crowded at night you can generally enjoy a nice glass of wine before the rush at happy hour. 

Definitely a more sophisticated and professional clientele.  See Major League Baseball and PGA tour players here a lot.  Can't go wrong pairing the Liberty School Cabernet with The Mediterranean Board appetizer. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly consistent service.  Great for lunch and dinner.  Highly recommend.  Salads are great."}
{"text":"I was at the DCRanch location for the first time I was with a friend we sat opposite each other and my friend left and the Waitress stuck me the bill which included my friends tab and everyone after that who sat down to talk with me. WTF after getting the actual copy from my bank I called manager and never did he offer to refund me. So I say to everyone make sure before you sit down at a reserved area don't be the last person to leave you will be stuck with the bill."}
{"text":"Interesting place.  I found it on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  In fairness it was a Friday evening and the place was hopping with Happy Hourer's.  It was really hot outside so we were all jammed into every table inside.  If you add the closeness of the tables, lowish ceilings, concrete type floor, a full house and pour a dj on top it was literally impossible to hear our friends, the server etc.  

However, the good was excellent.  I had the lamb chops and was a happy bunny.  My friends loved the appetizers and my husbands meal rocked too.

I would recommend it, but if you want some conversation, just avoid the after work happy hour.

Enjoy...."}
{"text":"Wanted a wine and tapas kind of place.  Happened in with 10 minutes left in happy hour and got some good help through the pretty extensive menu in a way that allowed us to participate in the discount offered.

Needed the gluten free option for bruschetta so was happy to be able to enjoy it. Had the parents with us who did not appreciate the volume of the music or the spice of the wasabi peas. I have to say I agree about how loud the music is. One reason to go to a wine bar would be for an atmosphere that fosters conversations. Had we wanted a loud bar, we could have gone anywhere for that.

Server acted  counter to many reviews that said service was bad. Service was very good, much appreciated"}
{"text":"This place is an extension of downtown Chandler and Chandler Mall's Kona Grill... it provides a great atmosphere and lounge with friends after work. 

It's really about happy hour as the specials are great and the vibe is really cool for what I consider a professional person. The only downside is when it's hot outside you can't really enjoy that outdoor patio area until the sun truly goes down. 

happy hour can be a little hectic so you got to hustle in order to find a table, esp for a large group. We decided to come in after dinner from a nearby restaurant just to relax and of course listen to a live DJ and grab a few drinks before taking off to our next location. 

Personally our experience was great but one of the things I cannot stand are servers who talk in that real high pitch baby voice. It was like a buzz kill! I get it's the ' really friendly personality' but it weighed on us during the visit."}
{"text":"In search of a small bite to eat and a quick, but relaxing glass of wine, a friend and I stopped in at The Living Room a few months ago and had what is quite possibly one of the worst dining \"experiences\" we've had in a while; if I could rate negative stars I would. 

To start with the only good part of our evening, the food was delicious. We ordered the fondue to start, the prosciutto and brie sandwich for me and the house roasted turkey sandwich for my friend. The fondue was comparable to that of the finer 'The Melting Pot' with a flavorful, gooey, melty cheese and the perfect assortment of dippers ranging from fresh apple slices and veggies to soft, warm pretzel pieces. My pressed sandwich had the right amount of crispiness to the bread, the prosciutto salty but flavorful and the brie creamy and spreadable, just the way it's supposed to. My friends' turkey sandwich must have been good because I don't think she spoke one word until her sandwich was gone, it was that delicious. The amazing food was the only positive part of our trip to the Living Room.

Now, on to the downsides, it began when we walked in the front door. First thing one sees in the doorway is a sign asking guests to wait to be seated, to which we did. For almost 10 minutes. Finally, a man dressed in a casual flannel shirt and jeans was bothered enough to look up and tell us to pick a seat anywhere all the while trying to quickly shove his phone back in his pocket. After we picked a table, and waited about five more minutes, a waitress brought us some waters and menus and gave us some time look things over and make some selections. My friend and I perused the wine list and waited for our server to come back and take our orders, but after hearing he table next to us ask for water refills and seeing how long they had waited, we decided to skip straight to the food and save the wine for another time. More time passed, we had to flag the waitress down to take our order (but not before reminding her the other table still hadn't gotten water and had waited longer) to which she took our orders. She never wrote anything down as she listened to our orders, but remembered to ask if wanted the fondue out first or all the food together to which we asked for our appetizer out first.  

Quite some time went by and we saw what looked like an order of fondue come in the kitchen window, which is left in full view of the customers in the middle of the restaurant, but alas no one noticed and took it to our table. Shortly after noticing the fondue in the kitchen window, a different server brought us our sandwiches and when she asked if we needed anything else, we asked if she could take the fondue off of our ticket as we never got it. A dramatic sigh was all we received in response and then she disappeared to speak with the man in the flannel shirt who could only be found texting at the bar top and giggling with a group of young ladies sharing a bottle of wine. He soon came over and delivered the fondue himself, said he would take it off the bill, and turned around to return to the bar top. My friend and I finished our meal and began looking for the server to ask for the check, to no avail. We had to eventually flag down yet a different server to ask for our bill, which also never came. After becoming fed up with the lack of service, long wait times, and blatant disregard for our satisfaction as customers, my friend and I left what we hope was enough cash to cover the bill and left. 

I really wanted to like this place, the catchy music, trendy décor, sophisticated air of a wine bar, and the food selections sound like the perfect mix for a new get together spot for my friend and I, but the lack of service far outweighs the few selling points this restaurant had to offer."}
{"text":"Ever feel guilty about drinking before noon? Well you definitely wont at this place. A wonderful happy hour starting at 11am that doesn't give you the judgy face. You can blame it on the fact that the mixed drinks are $5 during happy hour. The drink list is plenty and there are delicious things to eat while you are at it. Give the cheese or chocolate fondue a chance. They both come with a wide variety of nibbles to dip into that bottomless pot of sin. The atmosphere is laid back but still hip. There are games for you to play and people to watch."}
{"text":"So, I literally just reviewed 5th and Wine, the Scottsdale place owned by the same proprietors that own this wine bar/bistro in Chandler, which makes me a feel a bit repetitive since the menus are pretty much identical, but I'll give you the Cliff Notes version of the food and drink review and then move on to what's unique about this place. 

Food:
*Bruschetta toppings are really solid but bread is a bit soft
*Vegetable salad is really fresh but could use better lettuce
*Tuna panini was really good and quite large for the price

Drink 
*Bloody Mary Martini with jalapeno vodka and fresh mozzarella garnish is where it's at
*The glass of Albarino ($5 during happy hour) was really crisp and good

What makes the Living Room different is that it's much more of a swanky/loungey feel, while the 5th and Wine spot feels a bit more cafe-like. Also, the outdoor area of the Living Room is super comfortable, with big couches to lounge on, a sweet fireplace, and a lovely breeze (if you're lucky enough to be there in March, like I was!). Our server was also decidedly less formal than the one at 5th and Wine but still very on top of it. 

I would definitely not drive back to South Chandler to go to this place, but I would certainly do so if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Lively and has great food, sushi is yummy, super salad is awesome, tortilla soup is also great!"}
{"text":"I came for appetizers and drinks.  The food was a joke.  The fondu was less fondu and more a solid block of cheese.  The bruschetta was better, but still didn't make up for the cheese I was still gnawing on.  The ambiance is the only passable thing about this place."}
{"text":"I can't do less than 1 star. Terrible service. Who wants to be served by a guy chewing a gum in front of you? I don't. My boyfriend either. 
The food is ok, drinks way too expensive. I could barely feel the tequila in my margarita. I have to say we didn't wait long for the food to arrive, but where was the Brie on my bruschetta? Couldn't feel a taste of it. Too bad. 
I used to love this place, I brought some friends and had a blast. 
Tonight is just the worst experience I have ever had. Won't come by again. For sure."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out, they have a patio with couches, fire tables, misters and it's dog friendly.
Service is top notch.
Lamb chops were amazing, cheese board was so yummy.
Live music was great too."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. No hostess to greet and seat you. Many empty tables that actually were too close together and overcrowded the place. We took the servers suggestions and ordered. There was so little meat on the 3 sliders that if we combined it all it would equate to a McDonalds size hamburger patty.  My mixed drink was poorly prepared. We ordered an appetizer but then server returned to tell us it was unavailable.  This place used to be pretty fun, not so much now."}
{"text":"The food is okay. It seemed to mimic \"Postino's\" wine bar which is far better. We tried the bruschetta, a sandwich, a salad, and the fondue for dessert. Not impressed at all with the food. Good wine. Nice atmosphere. Great outdoor patio. Great service."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've been coming here for years and I never have any complaints whatsoever.  It's always a great time with friends of family when coming here.  In the fall when the weather is nicer, the patio is a great place to converse.  The flat breads are my all time favorite and they have a wide range of drinks and wine tastings to get you a nice buzz.  My most favorite thing about The Living Room is the ambiance and the atmosphere.  Even though I have only seen pics of the new location in Ahwatukee, this will always be the best location no matter what haha.  I'm sure the new location is awesome, probably more lively and open v.s. the intimate feeling of this location.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Beautiful ambiance, excellent food and drinks and in a location that isn't a complete zoo on weekend nights. Not sure why it has lower stars. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and people! Can't beat specials and good times. Good service, food and drinks. Can't forget the 80's-90's music that we all love. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've never left a restaurant before! We sat down and someone took our drink orders and then we didn't see anyone for 20-25 minutes. So...we left. Kinda bummed at the poor service."}
{"text":"outstanding evening.  great service, very nice décor and the food was outstanding.  Will always come back when we are in town. Zach our server made the evening memorable.  the fries are the best in town."}
{"text":"Fun outdoor seating, staff friendly and helpful. Food was good and portions large enough to share."}
{"text":"Unique open friendly atmosphere. Reasonablly prices and tasty food.
Will be back to check out rest of menu.
Tuna melt, chicken salad sandwichs were great."}
{"text":"I have dined here a handful of time. The service is good, no complaints there. But the food hasn't blown me away yet. My boyfriend and I are lovers of the Bruschetta but everything else we have tried just didn't quiet cut it. The Tuna Melt is OK but lacks originality. The drinks however usually don't disappoint although on our last visit the Sangria was terrible. I am not sure if the bartender made it wrong but it was way too sweet and not nearly enough wine was in it. I had to send it back and go with a Mojito that was OK. 
I will say that I do love the concept and the setting of the establishment. It has a good vibe and great for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Went there for a friends birthday. The service was lacking & the food was mediocre. Nice atmosphere. I probably won't be back though."}
{"text":"Their after work happy hour appears upscale, but it really gives off a sports bar vibe. Service is average. Bruschetta was not crispy and very skimpy on the brie. Portions are tiny -- definitely tapas, not dinner."}
{"text":"Great place to get brunch before the Phoenix Open. DC Ranch even had a shuttle that took you to the open"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Went in during happy hour, which was definitely a peak time for the establishment, and was pleased to receive very prompt and attentive servers! Great food and the happy hour deals were out of this world. Hard to find in this particular area of Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The live music at brunch is so loud you can't talk to your companion. Ask the servers or manager to turn the volume down gets no results. So, you leave with a headache. Next time I go to the living room it will be at home."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, great for happy hour.  Probably even better when its not 114 degrees outside, since they have roll-up walls that will really open up the area when the mercury is more accommodating.

Loved the half-sandwich/salad lunch combo.  Their strawberry spinach salad is worth coming back for, and the paninis are manly enough for my lunch bunch, since they're packing baby swiss, roasted red pepper, and bacon horseradish spread.

Their happy hour specials are great, with $5 sangria's and $2.50 drafts.  That's right Spanky, come get your PBR on!"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and packed on a Saturday.  A little tough to get around with so many people, but everyone was polite and let everyone through.  Would love to try their food next time, looked and smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Went last weekend with a friend and we had great service! Our servers were attentive and friendly and omg the penguin cocktail is SO GOOD! The appetizers we had were delicious as well. Such a trendy, fun atmosphere. Will def be back :)"}
{"text":"I usually go to The Living Room in Chandler but decided to try out the Scottsdale location today. Perfection! The staff is amazing and very attentive, especially Hudson:) food was great quality, don't be afraid of ordering sushi at a wine bar, the KIG is great!"}
{"text":"Mike akA \"Mickie\" is so personal & delighted to have had him at my service. What great service I have experienced. Definitely coming back. Love the living room."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to like this place, I just can't I've it 3 stars. Honestly I HAD to compare it to Postino's since 1. In my eyes they have the BEST bruachetta and atmosphere and 2. I heard the living room copied their style, and unfortunately it's a bad copy. They did get the atmosphere/ambience right. However the bruchetta not so much.

We tried the steak, tomato and apple fig. The apple fig was delisous, but u can't really go wrong with that receipe. Been there done that. The tomato was a disappointment. Seems like they tried to do their own unique take on the original and for me it just didn't work. The steak was ok, unique yes. But I could live without it."}
{"text":"I heard good things from several coworkers about this place and took my friends to check it out.  We weren't disappointed.  The team service concept (we had several servers) seemed a little disorganized and disjointed, but it was Saturday evening so it was understandable that they were busy and not able to be super attentive.   The drinks were good and we ordered several apps that were quite tasty.   For the ambiance and area you get, the prices are not too bad.   The craziest part is the people watching.  My group was probably the youngest in the restaurant with the most original unaltered body parts."}
{"text":"Dave kicks ass! From The first day we came to the living room, approximately one year ago for my birthday celebration, he was so attentive to bringing us beer after beer. He didn't care that we were drinking $2.75 PBR's, he kept them coming all night. One year later we come back to celebrate my birthday again lo and behold Dave comes through bringing PBR after PBR. Sometimes the service can be a little off here but ask for Dave he's the best."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great service, great food, and great environment. We sat at the table attached to the bar so the bartender was our server as well. His name was Travis and he made us feel right at home.  He was very attentive even though he was dealing with the whole bar. I've worked many positions at restaurants and I can tell you this guys k own the business. We will be back. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"It is a very average place for work Happy Hours...been here a few times and it's better if you call ahead for a big group. Lunch is a little pricey but we will go if someone plans an event after work and will stay for a few drinks.

Also, Living Room = Cougar town on Thursdays and Fridays."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place especially since I've heard of it from friends (not this location). Where do I start? Two menus and 5 different cuisines! The service was ok. When asked for recommendations the server suggested the lettuce wraps....if that's one of the best items this place has some work to do. My group was so overwhelmed with the 150 items on the menu that we couldn't decide. We ordered a few different things and nothing was great. My group didn't enjoy it and because it was my suggestion, I'll never hear the end of it. 

What kind of restaurant is this place? Sushi,flatbread,tacos,lettuce wraps,burgers,fondue and much more.....identity crisis?  

I may go back and try again if I can get a decent meal but the rest of my group wasn't impressed. One of the worst restaurants I've been to in a long time:( so disappointed"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place. Great food and wine at decent prices.  Great U shaped bar, sofas, high tops.  Very comfortable and even when the place is full it's not really loud.  Great location. Loved it. And we are Postino fans. This is better !"}
{"text":"Great menu- and an even better happy hour! This is a great  place to catch up with friends, since it's not super loud, but still a hopping place. The drink menu is creative, and I love the decor - I would recommend the Living Room!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and loved it! The pizza was on a crispy flatbread which I wasn't expecting but really enjoyed and our server was lovely."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectation. I had a friend who always raves about this place so I finally went! It is super fresh and delicious. We went in a group and ordered the margarita pizza and a few drinks with edamame (seasoned with Lemon pepper!!!) so yummy. The service was above expectations and the environment was super relaxing and enjoyable. I will def come here for brunch or the next time there is an open mic."}
{"text":"i was excited to try a new wine bar in the east valley. decided to try the living room for some happy hour fun on thursday.

my first impression is: 
they did a great job with the decor and we sat in the bar. the doors open to very neat patio. the wine is 5 dollar a glass until 6pm and the selection is nice.  i did order bruschetta but did not end up eating very much of it since i wasn't extremely hungry.  it was OK, not fabulous like postino's bruschetta.

our waitress was nice, however she was super busy and did not come back to check on us as often as I would like.  the music is super loud...i mean LOUD!! you have to scream to have a conversation and i did not like the selection of music. The variety was so strange, first they would play country, then disco, motown. if they stayed with one genre of music that would be great.  my preference would be jazz, r&b, top 20 in a wine bar.  unsure if i would return soon? perhaps in the future once things improve."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars to this place I would..what a disappointment. Really wish I had taken the time to read reviews before coming here for brunch today. Anywho came in for brunch with my dad on my lunch break had seen this place a couple of times on my visits to sauce and was super excited to try it after checking out the menu online. Due to only having an hour on my break I ordered some fries and my dad a salad. Both very simple things to prepare.. you would think. The guy who took our orders seemed super casual in his red polo and jeans and after bringing us water immediately took place behind the bar to chat up some guys sitting there. My dad and I waited for more than 30 minutes for this food to be brought out. Had to get up and go grab the only other person working and ask her to check on our food she said sure thing and went to the kitchen came out and then proceeded to ignore us entirely. The guy who had taken our orders still standing there at the bar chatting with someone paid us absolutely no attention this entire time. At this point I'm starving and need to go back to work so we get up to leave and get this the guy says \"oh yeah I was just about to go check on your food!\" Uh were you really guy? It's ok go back to socializing we won't be back. Wanted to enjoy this place so bad considering the lovely atmosphere but nothing can make up for terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for drinks and dinner and had horrible service. The food and drinks were great!!The place wasn't busy at all and the servers only came to check on us 2 through our whole 2 hour stay. Didn't wanna pull the race card but that's how it felt seeing as though everyone else was being helped multiple times. They will never get another dime of mine."}
{"text":"I sure wish my living room looked like this place! Great interior design with a classy, sophisticated atmosphere. I recently planned my boss's 50th birthday here and we had a great evening! Thanks for great service, we had one dedicated server and he was on it! We also planned to have appetizers and pizzas delivered throughout the evening and it worked out perfectly! We had some flatbread pizzas, bruschetta planks, spinach artichoke dip, sliders and cheese fondue. Plenty for all of our guests and everything kept disappearing so we clearly enjoyed it! 

The restaurant was packed on this particular evening and the staff handled it like champs. I would hold other parties or events here, making sure to plan the menu and discuss our wants with a manager ahead of time. 

I totally forgot to mention the layout of this restaurant. It's pretty cool. There are a few really neat wrap around patios. And inside the dining room has an open layout with smaller little nooks for larger groups. Check it out, you'll definitely be comfortable in this living room!"}
{"text":"If you like to yell at your companions & have trouble hearing any conversation, like overpriced mediocre food & want to beg for condiments......then this is the place for you!!  Sat at the bar & the bartenders were good & did a good job. But are doubtful we will ever return. Too many other better options in the area."}
{"text":"There are just a lot of better places out there. Snobby lackluster service and the food is meh."}
{"text":"Wow, this place had ambiance, great food and cocktails. To be honest the outdoor seating was way better than inside. We arrived 4/20 around 7pm. The service was great and it was a good experience, so why then a 1 star review? Ownership please look to the day and see who the DJ was that night. My friend and I approached the DJ and inquired if the bar area transitioned into a dance floor. His response was the ownership didn't want to attract the wrong crowd- ok reasonable I guess. We then asked if we could request some other girls music Whitney Houston Cyndi Lauper.... He then informed us that he doesn't stray from his playlist because it could get \"dark in here\" Umm.... pretty sure that was a intimating a racial slur. We with our mouths opens dumb founded explained we were visiting from the Bay Area and looking for a place to dance. He then informed me he hated the Bay Area and ask the bartender - she might know, which we didn't. I mean what a miserable person!With that we called it a night and was home by 930. I refuse to believe that this establishment is \"bad\" but what is IS this employee. Immediately when he opened his mouth speaking very negatively of the ownership I felt bad that they've cut a paycheck to a someone poorly marketing their business. I still believe this place is great- change your DJ!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and customer service. The prime rib sliders and oysters were superb, not to mention their Moscow Mule, the best I ever had in Scottsdale. This is a hip joint and fun atmosphere with live acoustics on Sunday's."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of the Living Room in DC Ranch, always felt the service was good but the food mediocre. Yesterday I decided to try the Gainey Village location a try. Who would think it could be worse, but it was. I got there at 430p, maybe six people at the bar and only one bartender.  He was not exactly oozing with warmth, kind of got the feeling he was not a happy camper himself. I ordered a house speciality drink, it was actually pretty good. Unfortunately, it went down from there. The margarita flatbread was a  pitiful attempt. It was everything I could do not to have my jaw drop when it was served to me. It was on a crackerbread and literally looked like someone had dumped tomato sauce on it. I took two tiny bites and pushed it away.  The bartender offered to have it re-made but I chose to try something else. Next came \"bang bang shrimp\". I'm not exactly sure what the chef had in mind when he came up with this recipe. I ate it, only because I figured anymore complaining would not be well received. I also noticed only one person in the kitchen, not a good sign. I asked for a glass of wine and waited quite a long time until he had a chance to pour it as now the bar was getting busier and he was the only bartender.  So now I'm done and it took me a while just to get his attention to let him know I wanted my check. Good grief, this was getting ridiculous! I always leave a 20% tip. Forget how bad the food was, the service sucked along with his attitude. He got 10% and that was pushing it. Bottom line, if you don't care about food quality or service then this restaurant will probably be OK for you. If however, you're a Foodie like me, keep on going. Take your business to Chris Collins restaurants close by, Wally's on Doubletree Ranch road or Grassroots and Twisted Grove on Hayden and Via de Ventura (10 Mins away). The food is excellent, the staff is happy and the service is wonderful. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went for brunch yesterday with outlr Groupon in hand. We both ordered te and breakfast sliders and were both happy with our choice in menu items and in restaurants. We especially liked the shredded cheese that is used on the sliders rather than slices. As for a brunch location, we both agreed that we are going to go back sometime soon as our service and experience was great."}
{"text":"Everything about this place rocked! The drinks, food, and the service! Thank you to Anthony, our server, we loved you!"}
{"text":"Had an afternoon happy hour meeting here on May 3.  Excellent service, attentive wait staff and reasonable happy hour prices (unusual for Scottsdale).  Didn't have any food, but the menu selection and the plates coming out of the kitchen all looked great."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and drinks.  Go before 6 for happy hour prices. Try the peach smashed martini and prime rib dip (au jus)."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was good. It was a relaxed atmosphere and overall a good experience. I wouldn't recommend this for large groups. We were a large party spread out over the restaurant. The sliders were awesome and I highly recommend them..."}
{"text":"Summer evenings on the patio are quite beautiful... I love the casual and relaxed vibe of this restaurant. They also have DJs and live music on some nights. 

The place is great for small bites and hanging out. I gravitate towards the bruschetta  options and of course the cheese board. Once we had gone with a larger group and a few preferred sushi over bruschetta, so they ordered food from the sister restaurant that is next door. It wasn't an issue and in fact, I think one of the waiters suggested it as an option. Worked out well, everyone was content."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and it hasn't disappointed yet. The food is always delicious this was my first time doing brunch and it was good !!!! I highly recommend the penguin cocktail my new favorite drink perfect for this heat. It's a delicious frozen foo foo drink the chicken & waffles where amazing !!!! And too top it off you have to get the injectable doughnuts yum !!!! A great way to spend your morning with girlfriends or a special someone. They also had some nice live music which was fun."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you'd love in your neighborhood. Simple & delicious food. Great atmosphere. Spot-on DJs. 

Staff are attentive. Bartenders are very talented and accommodating. 

Their shaved prime rib can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour and terrific service. Beer and a slider? . Then we followed with sushi and flat bread. 6 people sitting outside without being rushed. On a beautiful day was very pleasant. While we first arrived without the third couple the server was nice enough to offer the Beers and follow up later with the sliders, very nice. We will now come here more often realizing that the seating was so comfortable"}
{"text":"Came here to watch game 6 for the first time and they definitely had a great vibe. I was seated right away near the bar. The service was phenomenal and my water was constantly refilled. 

I had the French dip with the homemade chips that was perfect and a shock top. My girlfriend ordered the cheese/meat board and loved if!

Definitely coming back in the future. Great vibes and good prices!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here for the first time a few years ago and  I've been going here ever since. It's a very nice wine bar/lounge. It's a great place to meet up with friends for a drink and just socialize or even take a date here. The environment is very cozy and the name of the place speaks for itself. You have the option of sitting at one of their tables, the bar, their couches or on the outdoor patio. I love their outdoor patio, especially in the winter time because they have fire places that they turn on for you. They even have live music on certain days of the week as well.

As far as their menu, they have a variety of food that you can choose from. Soups, salads, sandwiches, and plenty desserts. If you do have a chance to come here you HAVE to try the bruschetta. They have 8 different types to choose from and in my opinion they all taste amazing. My favorite has to be the chicken salad or the Apples and Brie. I also LOVE their Chocolate Fondue. It comes with a variety of fruits, pretzels, marshmallows, etc. Very yummy! =) 

Now onto the best part, the drinks! They do have a pretty awesome happy hour. $5 for a selection of wines and $2.50 for drafts from 11am-6 pm. I'm more of a wine/martini drinker myself. They have a variety of their specialty martinis but I usually get one of my favorite drinks which is a Cosmopolitan. 

I love the atmosphere & environment of this place and would definitely recommend coming here for a date or small social gathering. You can't get any cozier than a place called The Living Room. =)"}
{"text":"We checked out The Living Room on it's opening weekend and it was packed. Luckily we managed to score a table pretty quickly in this very cool wine bar/restaurant which looks great and had a good atmosphere going on.

Our party ordered a couple bottles of well priced wines along with a bruschetta selection. I then went on to have a panini sandwich was was OK, nothing stunning but perfectly OK. If you have been to Postino in Arcadia you will recognize the menu immediately and thats a very good thing! Small plates with interesting ingredients is the order of the day here and I am personally thrilled that someone realized this concept would work down in the East Valley. Postino is my favorite restaurant in the Valley but sometimes you just don't want to schlep all the way up to Arcadia for a couple of glasses of wine and an appetizer. 

First impressions on a restaurant's opening weekend are always hard as you know they will improve as the weeks go by. There was a DJ on the night we were there that was intrusive to our conversation and added nothing to the evening (let's just hope that was a gimmick for the opening weekend). The wine selection was excellent but the food needed just a little tweaking. My sandwich was OK but could have been a lot better, not as crisp on the outside as you would normally like a  Panini. 

In the end I am very grateful to the owners of The Living Room for bringing this type of non-chain, wine-centric dining experience to Chandler where were are drowning in average restaurants. I will be back here for sure and will likely end up as a regular!"}
{"text":"Always my favorite getaway. It was a little noisy. But as always the food was great. the menu has change over time but it has changed for the better I could say. more variety of small plates which I love. I enjoy the sharable portions. the staff is friendly I wasn't wowed but I was ok. I'm hardly ever disappointed when I spot by."}
{"text":"Came with a big group and sat on the patio.  The servers were a little confused and we had like 3 different ones. I would have preferred to order at the bar, but that's ok.  Drinks were a little steep (calm down, Chandler).  Good music and a good time."}
{"text":"Okay, this is another local favorite.  My husband and I usually go here once a week on our way home from work.  Their wine, mixed drinks and draft beer are excellent!  The staff is super nice and always makes us feel welcome and the atmosphere is upbeat and fun!  The food is awesome!  I highly recommend their cheese fondue, spinach and artichoke dip, bruschetta, ahi tuna salad, french dip sandwich, turkey pinwheels...  okay you get the idea.  We haven't tried anything there we haven't liked!"}
{"text":"Really like the atmosphere here. I've only been twice....and have only had drinks.....but it's a cozy, friendly wine bar."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous. I've been here for brunch, which is putting her, and today for lunch. The Awesome Fries definitely live up to their name! And Parmesan flavor. Spend the extra couple bucks and get them with the creamy Brie on the side to dip them in. Heavenly!

The club sandwich is excellent and the house made potato chips are great as well. Plan on having dessert here! What can be better to inject yourself? You get two fillings and can choose from chocolate,  Bavarian cream, and berries.  

The staff is incredibly friendly and they all help out. You're not assigned to just one server. We had three people helping us they were all great place to sit and spend an afternoon. Lots of comfy couches live up to the name of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool hangout spot! My friends and I sat outside during the beautiful AZ winter. We enjoyed the fireside table and the warm ambiance? of the restaurant. We shared the Warm Pizza Cookie, which was so yummy. The caramel on top really sweetened the dish. I can't wait to return to this location for more great times."}
{"text":"Happy hour with my girls, drinking $5 a glass wine and eating their red pepper hummus...delish.  
This place is quite far, but I was extremely impressed with the site.  Very elegant yet not snobby (like Scottsdale).  Food was very, very tasty."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun little place in Chandler. 

You'd think a wine bar would be quiet and quaint but when we went it was loud and very club-like. There's plenty of seating and the service was decent. They also have little outside areas with heaters, which are cool but for some reason they allow people to go out there and smoke which blows into the inside. I thought there was a law against this but what do I know?

I ordered the spicy red flute which came with 3 half glasses of Malbec, Syrah, and a Red Zinfandel for $13. The price wasn't bad but the wine was about B-/C+. I have definitely had better but 3 glasses for $13 isn't bad. They say they're half glasses but they felt more like a full glass that you'd get at a restaurant. 

The red sangria is awful and I wouldn't order that again."}
{"text":"Pigs & Pinot, a great night out at the Living Room wine bar.  This was Living Room's grand opening celebration and was a big event to say the least.  Wine vendors everywhere giving samples, live music and Every COUGAR in The Chandler/Ocotillo Arizona area Out On The Hunt!  We had a blast drinking and watching!!!  GRRRR!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the Living room tonight. Beef sliders, cold, Auju, cold, fries, cold!  Service terrible! Wait staff at the end of the room chomping on food. Many unhappy guests tonight. I onced loved this place but there is no excuse to serve cold food. My husband turned it back and will not give second chances. I agree, why would you pay for bad food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The vibe is super swanky and the patio is so cozy in the cooler months of Arizona. The wine list is extensive and the half off bottles are totally worth it. A definite date night go to or a boozy brunch with friends. Management is always super friendly and the staff is mostly attentive! They have live music on the patio and then inside as well depending when you go. Love love love love."}
{"text":"Have been to this location and the one in Gainey Ranch a few times. Nice upscale wine bar with decent beers and good food. Good fun eclectic crowd with lots of single girls and guys. Good mix of people. Have a daily happy hour from 3 to 6. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The patio furniture alone is a MAJOR improvement! It's so comfortable and inviting!! Great menu, great service. So far -so good!!"}
{"text":"We came here as the Breakfast Joynt wait was too long, and so we ended up here for brunch. It was still a great choice as my fritata was delicious, and just the right portion. Coffee refills kept coming, and it was a very chill and relaxing atmosphere. The waitress was nice as well, and the prices were ok. I would love to come back for another meal in the day."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with friends and I'd giving the food 3 stars and atmosphere and service 4 stars. We didn't have wine but did have sandwiches which were nothing exciting making me want to return to try other things on the menu. Two of us had the chicken salad aioli sandwich on sourdough, the only kind of bread they have, which was bland, skimpy amount of chicken and even the bread was uneventful. Definitely overpriced. We choose this because our waiter told us this was the best sandwich on the menu! Our other friend got the turkey sandwich and she felt the same about that, bland, with a skimpy amount of turkey between two pieces of boring toasted bread. 3 skimpy sandwiches that totaled $37.00 without tip. I was really hoping this would be my first visit of many but there are way too many restaurants and wine bars in Scottsdale to spend my money at."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed; way too big & still a Postino's wanna be but falls short & doing too much (sushi, burgers...?!). Prices also very high & pkg tough..."}
{"text":"Perfect evening on the Patio. Nicole was attentive and friendly. We enjoyed our sliders, edamame and drinks. Ideal for a light bite or a bigger meal. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food OK. Service not good at all. Brought my work team here and food came out at different times or not at all."}
{"text":"I don't love this place.  I've gone a few times.  I feel that the service is mediocre - never very friendly or \"on it\".  the tables are way too close together - it's tough to get up, or even sit when people are int he tables right next to you.

the food and drinks are all quite good.  I've enjoyed everything I've ever gotten there, but the ambiance is so questionable that it overshadows the food."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a group of friends and we had a great time.  It was a week night and so we did not experience the loud music or crowdedness that some of the other reviewers complained about.  I will say that the service was still pretty slow.  We were practically the only ones there but had so send out a scout for our waitress.  They have a great list of wines by the glass but our group tried two of their specialty martini's and we all agreed they were both awful.  I really like the bruscetta and other apps but I could never get my husband to come here without heartier food."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Love the ambience and dog friendly. Happy Hour deals rock! Sundays are the best...Live music, half off wine!"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow, seems they are not staffed to support the demand. Ahi Tuna salad is good, OK selection of beer on draft"}
{"text":"Great place for date night! Food, cocktails and service are great! Jodi and I are there every week. Try the lamb chops if you want something to talk about!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and fail to write a review. However, tonight included exceptional service again and had to spread with the masses. I tend to always get the flat bread pizza and some sort of merlot and it's a great combination for me.... it's like playboy bunnies are having a pillow fight in my mouth. It's kinda tucked away from the main areas of chandler, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been to TLR a couple times and it's usually a great experience. This time it was subpar. We came in on a Thursday about 90 minutes before close. There wasn't a crowd just about 3 or 4 tables but we were hardly tended to and when we were the waitress wasn't very pleasant and forgot to give us menus and brought the wrong drink. I normally am really understanding of forgetting things but she wasn't pleasant and just seemed to want to rush us out....other than that it's a great place for ambiance and nice wine selection but you can't always count on superior service.  The other staff we encountered were gracious our waitress just seemed like she didn't care."}
{"text":"I lived in Hawaii for a number of years and during that period I'd go to the Ala Moana mall from time to time.  If you've never been there, it's not an enclosed mall, so as you walk from store to store you're outside.  What I always found odd was that the majority of the stores in the mall kept their doors open and their air conditioners cranked up so that as you walked past you got hit with a cold blast of air.

So why do I bring this up?  Well for whatever reason the Living Room kind of does the same thing.  Only problem is we live in Arizona and not a tropical island.  Why on earth, when its 100 degrees outside, would you leave all the doors open in your restaurant?

Anyway now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about the food.

In short not bad.  I didn't really find it remarkable, as in they have one dish I absolutely have to come back for, rather it was serviceable.

What was remarkable was their happy hour prices on wine.  $5 bucks for anything on the by the glass menu.  Pretty good deal.  Oddly however, no food choices for happy hour...or at least I wasn't offered any.

One last point....pricey...I dropped $50 bucks for lunch.  Not sure I got $50 in value...certainly the 3 glasses of wine were a good buy, but that's about it."}
{"text":"The Living Room is a great place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or simply relaxing.  The food and drinks are all very good.  I love their outdoor space with comfortable oversized furniture.  With one exception, I've always had excellence service here.

I love taking friends from out-of-town here as it is a wonderful space to relax and enjoy Scottsdale.  

I recommend the bang bang shrimp as well as the sushi rolls.

Note, this place can be extremely busy and noisy on Friday and weekend nights - to be expected but just an FYI.  At other times, it is pleasantly relaxing."}
{"text":"I sat out on their patio on a beautiful Sunday November evening with a good friend and we enjoyed absolutely everything about our experience!  There was an incredible live guitarist on the patio and the server told us someone plays every Sunday evening. The ambiance of this location is perfection as we could see the stars and moon shining down on us since the DC Marketplace uses low lights. The one and only improvement I could suggest was a few more check ins at our table by our server.

We ordered the cheese fondue made with creamy brie, which was super yummy, and it came with a plate of soft pretzel nuggets, small slices of ciabatta bread, sliced apples and steamed cauliflower to dip with. Also ordered the plate of assorted olives for $5 and it was loaded with olives! My friend and I split the Prime Rib Sliders with a total of 4 delicious sliders to split between us.  It was served with au jus and a big side of horseradish sauce that was to die for.  It was the perfect amount of food for us. Very satisfied with the flavors of all 3 of our dishes and the price seemed about right for the quantity served while also keeping in mind we are in pricey Scottsdale.

Topping off our entire evening was the half priced bottles of wine featured that evening. We settled on a wonderful bottle of Caymus Red Schooner Malbec for $40 and it was peppery and delightful. So enjoyed our evening at The Living Room - Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great seating. I don't know if there is anything I don't like about this place. Food is a bit pricy but this is a great place to hang out with friends. We ordered bruschetta, shrimp cocktail, spicy tuna rolls, prime rib sliders, a flat bread pizza. Shrimp cocktail is my favorite. They gave you four giant shrimps and they fill cocktail sauce all the way to the top. Super delicious and I definitely recommend it. My second favorite is spicy tuna roll. It is exactly to my liking. My least favorite is prime rib slider. The blue cheese makes it tastes weird and the prime ribs were too smushy. I took a few bites and simply couldn't finish it. I definitely will not recommend that dish. 

I'll definitely come back here with my girlfriends to enjoy glasses of wine and small bites."}
{"text":"I give high marks for \"high season\". Sunday afternoons on the patio with live music, wine and somehow the perfect company trumps the hit or miss service. I keep returning... so they must be doing something right ...."}
{"text":"A fun place for wine and bruchetta. The hummus is DELISH! We actually ended up ordering a couple rounds of bruchetta, it was that good. My husband's favorite was the procuitto with figs and mascarpone cheese. I also had the roasted peppers with goat cheese, which was good, just a little bit too sweet. We also ordered turkey sliders.....we were a bit confused when they came out, when I think of slider I think of a mini burger; these were mini turkey sandwhiches, as in, they used deli meat turkey instead of a ground turkey meat patty. It was good, just not what I expected. 

Loved the fact that they had several wines for $5 before 6pm. Even on Sunday! I had a Pinot Noir from Mt. Pellier. sooooooooo good! Ever so slightly sweet and 'oaky', mild bodied and perfectly balanced. Went great with my goat cheese. 

Service was a little.....casual? Our server looked like she was on spring break or something....and not very knowledgeable of the wines (kinda sad, considering this is a WINE BAR) I can see what people mean about it being overly crowded....We happend to come on a slow day, but I could see potential for claustrophobia."}
