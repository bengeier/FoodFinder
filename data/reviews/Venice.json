{"text":"Very fresh poke.  Great guacamole.  Chips were not very tasty. Burnt and too thick.
Drinks were phenomenal.
Bartenders improvised ginger and mint muddled Pimm's cup was world class. 
Great stop when walkimg old montreal"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, fun, new and very healthy!! Not to mention healthy...

It's seriously very nice ;) I ate the salmon poke and replaced the rice with kale what make it even more awesome

There is alot of verity in the menu

Overall I would recommend it and definitely will come again

Oh and the basin lemon square is very very good"}
{"text":"We have our favorite casual Montreal restraurant and she is Venice. Have had the Poke bowls two nights running and I think we are going to hit it again tonight. Its that good. Tried the salmon and the tofu. I think I slightly prefered the Salmon because of the big WAD of pickled ginger. Had the guacamole starter and it was excellent. But what really impressed me was that the radius of the guak bowl matched the curve of the corn chips. Nice ambiance. Good fast service. Fairly cheep.  Good fresh food."}
{"text":"I tried the tuna poke and oh my it melts in your mouth! Super flavourful, light, and fresh. The decor is super charming and you can choose to eat inside or outside. They also have great pizza and the poke portion was very generous. The waitress was super nice with us and the food came pretty fast. Only downside is that it's on the higher side price wise for a student, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est incroyable. Je peux facilement recommander ce restaurant à n'importe qui, c'est toujours un succès.

Arrivez tôt en semaine, car une ligne se forme rapidement."}
{"text":"surfs up, splashed colours and green ferns decked this west coast Mtl implant!We got seated in the terasse without reservations (table for 2 around 6pm).

The menu was cute - with a showcase of salads, poké, toast, tacos, flat bread pizza and familiar desserts. My friend and I ordered 3 type of tacos (came in pairs):chicken which was drenched in sour cream and siracha**; pulled pork with pineapple**** (by far my favourite dish and wasn't swimming in dressing);shrimp with pickled beets** (I rate this taco less than the others because it was practically falling apart in beet juice). We also ordered the guacamole and chips on the side which was good (nothing out of the ordinary). The tacos definitely did not have the wow factor- as I have had better. However, 3 tacos each was quite filling.

For drinks the cocktails were a lot of fun but more on the sweeter note - both resembled daquiri styled drinks. 

Price range was 8$ to 20$ max on the menu. Service was great and very friendly - the staff knew the best sellers well and did not fail to disappoint.

Fun summer venue for causal eats."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while visiting because it was so popular just had to check it out. Was not disappointed! Poke bowl was delicious."}
{"text":"This review only applies to the Avocado Toast.

The coriander and the dill made for a horrible mix. It tasted like the Inside of a sharpie. I could hardly taste the avocado and the egg because I was overpowered by the rest. 

Now this could be because my taste buds are difficult to please but my boyfriend, who usually eats  everything, didn't like it either.

It's a real shame because I really wanted to like this place. I'm going to give them another chance (gotta try that Poke bowl and salad) but I'm dreading it a little bit. The prices are kinda high for what it is."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos: big enough to obliterate a grown man's hunger, filled with fresh and tasty ingredients.

Did not dine there, only went for pick ups. i might have felt an inkling of attitude from the young blonde lady at the counter, but nothing one cannot simply ignore and glide above :)

Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Eat here...GO here NOW!

Fresh and tasty mouthfuls of goodness in every bite!!!

Enjoyed the following:
Salmon Poke Bowl with Kale
Tuna Poke Bowl
The Basic Pizza
Avocado Toast
Sweet Potato Fries
Guacamole
Some Tasty beverage!"}
{"text":"It's a casual restaurant, when inside it feels like being next to the beach, also the waiter was friendly.
I ordered a tuna poke bowl with rice and shared a margarita flat bread pizza; I enjoyed both of them, specially the pizza which was a surprise. People usually order pokes, and a friend told me that tacos are good, I will have them on my next visit.
Finally, we took pleasure devouring a tasty fruit cheesecake."}
{"text":"Ambiance très jolie et simple. Nous avons pris les edamames qui sont enveloppés d'une petite sauce. Je les préfère plus simple mais c'était bon. Puis nous avons mangé un poké bol de thon et un autre de saumon. Très frais, le riz est bon, collant et la portion raisonnable. Poisson frais et portion raisonnable aussi."}
{"text":"The tuna poke bowl tastes like cheap sushi served on a revolving belt..... I paid almost $20 for this, I was not impressed. I've also had the fish taco which was also mediocre for its price. I thank Siracha for putting flavor in everything!"}
{"text":"Healthy but still full of flavor.  Give this place a try.  I ordered the Tofu poke bowl but substituted tuna with great results."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Service was excellent and good was yummy.  my friend and I were visiting from California and it was very authentic to what we are used to on the west coast. The owner Ben came over to introduce himself and made it extra special for us! We had el pastor tacos and tuna poke bowl. both very healthy & tasty. thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Great service! We tried Guacamole tortilla... the Guacamole taste fishy... and not much taste. We also ordered Salmon poke bowl and Tuna poke bowl, but both Salmon and Tuna are NOT fresh. We will NOT go back again."}
{"text":"Came in for some poke that was a bit lacklustre. The rice was dry and the toppings were a bit boring compared to other poke bowls I've had elsewhere. It was good regardless but for the price, I can't justify spending that much on a plate that was just ok. I wouldn't write this place off completely though because I had a bite of my friends shrimp taco and it was really good. The service was also really good and the place was clean. Our waiter was friendly and everyone was helpful with my child and our big clunky stroller."}
{"text":"Great guacamole, delicious salads, cool vibe. Great spot for lunch on our walking tour of Old Montreal and the surrounding area."}
{"text":"I ordered the tuna poke bowl and it was absolutely delicious. Food was very fresh presentation was very nice. It's a very cute place. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"First off if you want to get a table here for lunch during the week -definitely make a reservation or you'll be sure to wait in line for a while (useful tip they don't take reservations for groups of under 8people). The decor is very colourful and pretty to look at , very unique and bright/cheerful. The servers were quick/efficient/attentive and friendly. The prices were good as well. I had the tuna poke bowl and my colleagues had the shrimp poke bowl and the squash soup. The tuna was fresh as were the rest of the ingredients in my bowl and it had a nice flavour with a hint of spice , my only complain was that there was too much sauce on it and way too much lettuce-it  could have used a touch more tuna and maybe some more fresh veggies like avocado, my colleague said the same thing about the shrimp bowl in regards to the amount of sauce although she said the soup was excellent. All in all it was a good experience, but I can't say anything was a standout for me in the sense that I don't really see myself wanting to go back here again and again. BUT i would like to go back at some point to try one of their flatbread pizzas or desserts which sounded like they might be interesting. Definitely worth trying this place at least once though !"}
{"text":"Loved the poke . Beautiful plating and good flavors. Good and fresh ingredients! Will go back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant divin au vieux Montréal , on est allé le midi avec les collègues avec réservation , spécialité Poké bowl les prix sont corrects pour l'emplacement et le service est excellent il y a même des pizzas,  les déserts succulents surtout les cheesecakes et les brorwnies juste un peu écurants mais ça vaut le coup , pour moi c'est le best restau Poké bowl à Montréal"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Venice and the hype was very serious so my expectations were high.

I had the shrimp poke bowl. It was 20$. I was good, just not spectacular. The taste was a little bland. I'd qualify it as boring.

I wanted my mind blown and what I got was a bit of salad with a bit of rice and a few pieces of shrimp. I don't even recall there being an exciting sauce. 

My honest opinion is that it wasn't worth the 20$. I find that the poke bowls in the subterranean passage between PVM and Eaton center are better and more filling for a lower price."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and the food is good and fresh. I also love the deco and the location! We sat at the terrace and the seats and table were not the best but not a big deal. I would go back (and sit inside) to eat another poke!"}
{"text":"The lineups and crowd justify why this Californian style restaurant has become a huge hit. 

This is not the original restaurant. The first one opened on St-Francois Xavier. I had the pumpkin soup, tuna poke bowl and a brownie. They are known for their poke bowls and do a pretty good job in terms of ingredients and presentation. 


If you want to escape Montreal, simply stop by at Venice on beaverhall or their original location in the old port. 

Note: this location is not opened on weekends. Check the schedule before coming."}
