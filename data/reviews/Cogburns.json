{"text":"Went to try place for first time with family to watch Baylor game.  Hostess walked us by four open booths and two tables to try to sit us in the corner on a four top table.  I explained that I really want to watch the Baylor game and my family would be more comfortable at one of the open booths.  The hostess the said  \" well, the waitresses are seated in a rotation.\" Implying she has to seat the next waitress section.  I understand the server rotation working in restraunts most of my younger days, but if a family wanted a specific area they are usually sat there and the rotation can be adjusted.  So I straight up said, \" well, we don't want to sit here.\" Pointing at the table shes trying to sit us at.  I showed her the TVs the Baylor game was on, so then she says, \"how bout if I sit you guys over there,\" pointing at another table which is smaller with only a view of one TV with the Baylor game on and where the table was at it would be like watching a movie from the front row, except instead of a movie screen its a 40 inch TV 8' above.  Basically the worse view of a TV that you could honestly pick.  I was not in the mood to have a discussion over just getting a table because I was already very annoyed.  So I looked at my kids and said \"let's go.\".   I understand if the place was full then you get what you get, but there were so many open booths and other tables.  If I can't get basic customer service when trying to ask for a certain area (with open tables) to watch a game I don't even want to see how the rest of the service is.  By looking at the reviews of this place on yelp I am not surprised at all.  Next time I will go to blu 32, uncle bears, tailgater's,  zipps, chili's or native new yorker which are all your competitors in your area and I will never step on your place again."}
{"text":"Great service, great looking girls, great selection. ENOUGH SAID.  Me and my wife come here all the time and always recommend it. Check out their wings, they are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband had been there a couple of time for wings and we decided to go there the other night. They were not busy at all, a few people in the bar. Our waitress was friendly enough, although maybe a bit shy. Waitresses are usually better and sell more when they are a bit more outgoing. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich with onion rings as a side and was less than impressed. I literally had 6 onion rings (the frozen kind, not fresh) and after each of my kids decided to help themselves to one, I had a huge void on my plate! The sandwich was underseasoned (the meat did not seem to even have been salted) and was so loaded with gritty cheddar cheese that it was difficult to eat. My advise...ditch the chedder and put on a nice white cheese like provelone. The peppers also did not have any flavor. We ordered some chicken fingers for the kids and I had a bite (since I only ate less than half of my sandwich) and let me say, I'm suprised my kid was eating them...they tasted like flour. I also tried one of my husbands wings (he had hot BBQ) and they were not bad. The hand cut fries were also good, although a tad soggy. If you are going to hand cut fries, why not make homemade onion rings too??? Considering that an order of onion rings was $7.50 on the appitizer menu, I would not have expected grocery store frozen rings!  We each also ordered a bloody mary and again...not good. The only spice was tabascco, no celery or other flavors at all. Again my advise...don't use regular tomato juice, use a good mix like Zing Zang. All the spices are already in it and all you have to do is add vodka, a splash of tobascco and garnish!  The waitress asked if I wanted a box for the other half of my sandwich and I wrinkled my nose and said no. To bad she didn't ask why I didn't want to take it home."}
{"text":"We keep going and trying this locations and service is horrible the food is pretty good but it takes 45 minutes to get a drink and longer to get food management does nothing to correct the problem hope u have better luck then we have"}
{"text":"This place is horrible...I just love their Nachos & Big A$$ wings. This is a must go, at least once to see how good it is. I said it was horrible earlier because it can't be good on the diet...oh well, everyone gets a cheat day."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service ever! Asked for the manager, got the owner, he looked drunk, disheveled and disinterested! Our server messed up the wing order and the wrap order. Our server was emptying ash trays on to the street. Gross place unless your only in the mood to get drunk."}
{"text":"Severs couldn't understand how to break up the bill, instead of bringing the check they brought more drinks, and instead of the audio for the tvs they played 90s pop music.  The food was decent though...I might consider take-out but I will not dine in again."}
{"text":"The service at Cogburns is awful.  The hostess station is manned by three or four people, who are more concerned with their conversation than they are with seating you.  Then, after you get seated, a very disinterested server throws menus on your table and walks away; not even pausing for the standard, \"how are you this evening?\" greeting. After waiting about 15 minutes, you then get the crabby server back at your table, snarling, \"what do you want?\" as if you are disturbing their very fascinating evening.  After ordering a drink, it takes about another 15 minutes to have the beers slammed down on your table, without so much as a, \"is there anything else I can get you?\"   I have never, ever been treated so poorly as I have at this place and I will never, ever go back.  They are not getting my service, ever, and I will tell everyone I know who asks about this place to avoid it like the plague. It is abysmal."}
{"text":"Food is great and service is excellent. Very attentive and took great care of me everytime. Christina and kylie is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Service is worth looking at. Good beer selection. Food could be better but who comes for the food. Older crowd and hipsters. May have to come back again."}
{"text":"Love this food,  best burger I have ever had,  we also had wings,  outstanding and reasonable prices. ..."}
{"text":"I took my wife and two children here last night after soccer practice to grab a bite to eat.  We were greeted immediately and seated right away, even though they appeared to be super busy with the NCAA Tourney on TV.  Then we sat.....and sat....and sat.  Finally, a server came over to take our drink orders.  My wife asked if they had a beer list and was told \"no.\"  Then she asked what was on tap.  The response:  22 different beers.  No elaboration.  My wife had to get up, walk towards the bar to see the tap handles, and then back to the table to put in her order.  We also asked for an order of mozzarella sticks to hold the kids over until our meals came.  Then we sat some more...probably another 15 minutes or so before she came back to take our meal order.  After 40 minutes of waiting for the mozzerella sticks, I flagged down our server and politely asked if there was any sign of those mozzerella sticks.  She snapped back at me \"the kitchen is slammed, they are backed up with orders, and they'll be out as soon as they're ready.\"  Then she walked away.  Shortly after, two kitchen servers came out with our entrees.  No mozzarella sticks.  I doubt our server ever went to actually check on them.  Who knows...maybe she forgot to put the order in altogether.  Regardless, no apology from anyone regarding the blunder.  It's too bad the service here stinks, because the food was great!  I had an assortment of wings which were meaty and sauced perfectly, and the garlic parmesean was fantastic!  Way better than Native New Yorker IMO.  My wife had the Southwestern Burger and fries which were also very good, and the kids had the Pony Burger and the mini corndogs.  They both cleaned their plates, so that says something right there.  We might go back and give this place a second chance with a different server.  But based on the negative reviews on service already, and the scowels I saw on other servers' faces, I'm not holding my breath that it will be any better.  Tip to the owner:  Hiring hot girls certainly adds an element of eye candy to your establishment, but if they can't do the job, people will eventually stop paying you to see what they can get for free on the web.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Pros:  The interior is very well designed, the atmosphere is fun, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.   Cons: The service is very slow  I go in often on my lunch break and more than once I've waited over 30 minutes for my order to come out. This is in the middle of the afternoon when the place is practically empty and the food still takes forever and a day to arrive.   When they are busy, ordering or having a drink refilled can take over 20 minutes;  and we all know that nothing kills a good time faster then waiting an eternity for another drink. The last time I went in here (on a Thursday night) I told the waitress I needed a minute to look over the menu; she left me and never came back. I spent over an hour sipping a beer with a menu in front of me and never even had an opportunity to place my order. In fact, I didn't see my original server again all night as another waitress brought me my check.   I see a lot of potential in this place, they are friendly, fun, and IMHO a great place to hang out but they need to get on point with their service or I'm going to find another place to spend my time."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was exceptional. Riana filled my drink without waiting for request, she was super attentive and checked if we wanted food multiple times. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Our party of four popped in to catch the Cardinals game (they also show the MMA fights for free).  Even though the place was packed we scored great seats in front of the giant screen tv and the waitress was at our table immediately taking drink and food orders from a well thought out menu.  The wings were cooked and spiced to perfection but the fries are the best anywhere with their secret flavorings and could be a meal in themselves.  We were introduced to their bright new manager who turns out is also trained in the world of mixology and brought us his version of an Old Fashioned to try on the house and it was amazing!  The place is dialed in for food, drinks, ambiance and customer care - that's earns it 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"They're wings are awesome I would give them a solid five stars if it wasn't for their blue cheese, I can understand cutting corners but you pride yourself on wings and then you give people watered down blue cheese disgusting runny gross. And it's been all the time lately, thought they ran out the first time, so get their wings to go and by your own blue cheese! FIX YOUR BLUE CHEESE PLEASE"}
{"text":"The wing special on Sundays are great! Can't wait for Sunday football to come back around. Great bartenders!"}
{"text":"Went In for lunch today. Fish and chips special was good, not great. Tried the wings and they were really good!"}
{"text":"They are doing it right, first store is packed every night, second store is getting better by the day, good luck on the new store, its close to my house so you got my business.."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:55 on Monday evening and asked to be seated downstairs.  After 10 minutes to be acknowledged came upstairs and asked if we needed to sit elsewhere to be waited on.  After 5 more minutes waitress shows up and says she didn't know this was her table although she seemed to have all the tables downstairs.  Finally ordered.  It was cheeseburger special night but the place wasn't crowded.  Seemed to be more waitresses than customers but also seemed to be too many chiefs and not enough Indians among the wait staff.   We ordered 3 cheeseburgers which you would expect should come out fairly quickly on cheeseburger special night.  Not.  We waited and waited and waited and finally at 7:47 we had had enough and got up and left telling the girl at the check stand that we thought 52 minutes was more than long enough to wait.  She didn't seem too concerned.  This is my second visit and have yet to see anyone who appeared to be a manager.  It is a shame that people spend a lot of money to open a place and then put teenagers working who could care less about the business."}
{"text":"This place gets one big MEH. The food was okay, but it was just food."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place that when you walk in your most definitely going to see a familiar face or two and have great conversation with either the staff or someone you met there before then this is the place to be.  I absolutely love the turkado sandwich with their onion rings crispy or some hot honeymustard wings!!   I make it a point to stop by at least once a week mainly Tuesday's  for their buy one shot get one for a dollar or Thursday's for their 40 cent wings.  All in all its a good place with good food cold beer and a great atmosphere. What more could you ask for?  Give this place a chance and I bet you will love it like I do!!"}
{"text":"Cogburn's was the go-to wings and beer bar for my wife and I, but something has changed in the past two months. They used to have the best wings in the  Phoenix area and service was good.  We were at Cogburn's at least once a week.   The service in the bar is usually good, the service out front has always been slow, but is now terrible.  Twice we have had to go find a server to place our order.  We actually left a substandard tip last night because service was so bad.  Whatever has changed, they need to change it back or just close the doors. What was once the best wings in town is now nothing more than Costco frozen wings with wings sauce poured all over them.  We had to send ours back last night as they came out cold, not warm but actually cold.  What used to be large, perfectly cooked wings with the perfect finish are now small, poorly prepared wings drowning in sauce. I will go back in two months so see if they recover, but I think unless they get back to were they were last Winter/Spring, they lost this customer."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so tremendously horrific, but they are! But I 've been going here for two years now and continue to love it (: the chicken wings are truly the best I've had (I know there is better) but oh! How I love them!  As for the service, it's always good. I will continue to go here!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the wings, they are amazing. Katie our server was awesome, couldn't have asked for better service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was okay, chicken wings were a little dry. The service was horrible, we waited about 20-25 mins for nachos. Our server didn't even refill our drinks until we were done eating."}
{"text":"I would really like this place if the music wasn't so loud. Turn the f$&@ing music down!!!!!!! It is ear piercing loud!!!"}
{"text":"The wings are terrible! They did not have very good flavor. They were giant and didn't seem to have enough sauce. It was hard to even try to get the chicken off the bone. Not that we really wanted to since the taste was so bad but we had already purchased them so felt obligated to eat them. I do not suggest this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"Went to this place to try to find a new watering hole. Our bartender was not inviting. It seemed like only the regulars received hospitality. She seemed to be in a very important conversation with the \"Local Biker Boys\". We received our check, and there were charges on there that we didn't make. On top of everything, I left my sunglasses there. I called and talked to a waitress, and she said that she would put them up for me, so that I could get them. When I went back, they couldn't find them. They must've gave them to one of the regulars. I would give this place a 0 star rating, but that was not an option. Save your money and go to somewhere else worth while. I've been to dive bars with better service."}
{"text":"The wings are amazing, spicy garlic is the way to go, good drink specials, great atmosphere and great scenery ;)"}
{"text":"Foods are ok, prices are fair and great looking girls. Great selection. However, some services are lame and slow. Will visit again as the bar is close to my place.. and probably for wings!"}
{"text":"Just had onion rings and amazing drunkin shrimp. Ryan our waiter was awesome. We will come back again just to see Ryan and have great food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Service is awful, beers are warm, the air conditioning doesn't seem to work well because it's hot as crap in here! Not to mention, our nachos came out cold with brown guacamole. Nasty! I Won't be back."}
{"text":"I am recommending that the TV show \"Bar Rescue\" visit here immediately!!!!  This place has terrible order turn around time and customer service.. It literally took 1.5 hours to get my appetizer order of chicken wings and chicken fingers.. AND it was a to-go order!!! The only reason I stayed and waited was because the playoff football game was on TV.. I hate to give them that compliment. Yes they have TV's there..Once I got the food I asked if it was just made or it had been sitting around, and she said it was fresh... LIE... Cold as hell!!! I threw it in the trash after one bite.. Thanks for taking my money.. I'll never go back.  Please don't bother.. Harvey Public House 3 miles North is ten times this place."}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch and a beer today. Food was very very good! Wings and burger and fries were delish! Waitress acted like it was her first day. Maybe it was? KNOW YOUR BEERS if you're a server, study the menu or write it down and put it in your pocket! All in all we will go back for the food!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Waitress was great! Booze was the best.  We had the wings and tried the nachos too.  Wings were great!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, cold beer and a nice ambiance.  Could use more advertising or a bigger sign, it's a bit hard to notice.  I loved the chili nachos and the burger was amazing."}
{"text":"Solid place, have been there a few times, with my kids and my wife.  Food is good, actually very good bar food.  I am not sure if it deserves 5 stars, but I hope they stay around and I can't complain."}
{"text":"Once we realized we couldn't even hold a conversation at the table because of the volume of the stereo we just got up and left. Wayyyyyyyy to loud."}
{"text":"Went for Thursday lunch. 40 cent wings. Tried BBQ honey. Medium buffalo and garlic parmesean. All three were very tasty and done to crispy perfection. Katie pur waiter was great! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The service was Aweful!  It took 20 minutes just to put a drink order in and they gave our food away and the server just laughed and said \"I probably won't get your food to you tonight\".  When they owner came over he wanted to start a fight by giving us a hard about us asking where our food was.  We paid our bill and when we were waiting for Uber he followed us outside with some of his boys, for what we couldn't figure out.  Because all he did was stare at us.  First time last time."}
{"text":"My golfing buddies and I had been to Peyton's place, and we were surprised when we found out the name had changed. We went there for lunch and most of us ordered the wings while a couple other of the guys ordered sandwiches. Everyone in our group of 12 was extremely happy with the service and the food. Understand we went for a late lunch, ~2:00. The business was not busy at that time, waitress was friendly and food arrived hot and fairly quickly considering the size of our group. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"First and last time we go to this place, went  Last night with a couple we haven't seen in some time,started off rough with a rude hostess, then went down hill fast with warm beer and a manger I use the term loosely has ZERO people skills! Waitress asked how everything was going,when we commented on the warm beers she replied I'll get the manager, he came over and was extremely rude, grabbed the mugs and told us They feel fine to me? The process to say What I didn't stick my finger in in it. He then came back with new beers, told us he ran his hand under the tap to make sure it was cold! That really makes you want to drink it knowing he ran his fingers in it! If we hadn't been with friends we haven't seen in some time we would have turned around and walked out before we were seated, at least we know to NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great daily specials and drink prices! The staff is great! :) We always feel like family!"}
{"text":"This place is a health code violation waiting to happen. When I went in the other day the whole place smelled like bleach. Not exactly a great sign. I got wings and pasta because I hadn't eaten that day and it was getting late. The wings were seriously burnt to a crisp, nearly inedible, but nothing could have prepared me for the pasta.  I don't know if someone had shaved their pubic hair and tossed it into the sauce before throwing the pasta in with it, or if one of the cooks has a large beard and was shedding like a Wookiee on Tatooine, but there was a handful of crimpy, curtainy hair in my food.   When I called to ask for a refund(this was take out food, I guess I should inspect it from now on before leaving restaurants), the man on the other end of the line just laughed and basically told me I was lying in as rude a way as possible. I know me not eating there isn't exactly going to bankrupt them, and the previous time I was there I had a great experience and the food was solid.   Avoid this place like the plague. It seems like everyone else is already anyway."}
{"text":"Food is great but horrible service all around. I came with my mom and we sat at the bar. It took them 10 minutes to even notice we were there. After she brought us our drinks (which one was Incorrect and I had to wave her down a hundred times) she went back to the bar and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to eat. She came back with the new drink 5 minutes later and was about to walk away until I said can we order? I orded an appetizer and after we finished the appetizer I waited a little to see if she was going to refill our drinks but she didn't I had to go and get her. So finally my mom got up and asked for a different server and so they got us another in which was rude as well. We will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  We knew it was a sports bar and would be loud but we didn't expect such good service (Melinda) and such good food.  The garlic parmesan wings were really good and our philly cheesesteak and cheeseburger were also worth coming back for.  So don't discount it for \"just another sport bar\" because the food and service were quite good."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! The so call waiter/hostess working on the afternoon of 01/31/14 (female fake everything, black hair, small jean shorts, also working in the bar) needs to learn how to treat a paying customer. Specially since she looks like she could use a tip $$$$. NOT family friendly, were told that a drink menu did not exist???? Really! ???? Did not try the food, we walked out!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonight because I was looking for a place to catch sports highlights and grab some food.  The beer selection was good and we had wings and fries which were fresh cut and good.  I should also note that their ranch dressing is also excellent (it's dumb, but I think it's the little things that count).  The bartender was quick and cheerful and we wound up meeting the owner who was also a pretty cool guy.  All-in-all this is a great local spot that goes out of their way to accommodate their clients.  I'll happily go here again and suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Not great, but not awful! Had the raspberry wings which was good. My husband had the hamburger which was over cooked. My daughter had the pizza which was a little plain. Not busy for poor service :("}
{"text":"If you drink a certain alcoholic beverage all your life you know what it should taste like!!  Two times now we have gone to Cogburns for drinks and they didn't taste right.  We spoke to the waitress and told her this doesn't taste like absolute,  she said \"I have never seen anyone pour anything else in the absolute bottle\"!  Really that's your first thought?  No proof but there alcohol does not taste like what should be in the bottle and you still get charged for what it should be!  Pretty sure this is illegal!!   It's to bad because we can walk there from our house.  Owner your responsible!!  Please stop this!!  Had to give a star rating but I tried to give zero for them being shady!  I guess after reading all the bad reviews I haves wasted my time posting!  The owner obviously doesn't care because nothing has changed!!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple...this place sucks. It's saving grace is serving breakfast on Sundays ( Sunday football ) but even that is a long shot. The breakfast is...meh and the service sucks. I would not recommend this place for anything"}
{"text":"Loved this place until my last two visits. In fact referred it to several people, loved starting my nights here or ending them, either way was a good time. The first of the two bad encounters, my husband and I were there with a friend from out of town for just a little over four hours. He consumed 2 beers, my girlfriend and I had two cocktails and a shot. We had an appetizer and all ate dinner. There was a shift change, and even tho the first waitress customer service wasn't great she managed to do well. The second girl came on and immediately came up to us and was asking us how we were getting home. We all looked at her confused because we had hardly anything to drink and were no where being rowdy. She suggested we get food, to which we clued her into our to go boxes from our dinner. Her rational was the amount of alcohol consumed in the amount of time. Not sure if she got us confused with some other table, didn't really care, paid our tab immediately and left. Second encounter was last night close to closing time, figured I'd give the place one more shot and brought a group of friends with. Sat up at the bar was greeted by a beautiful girl, great smile, got our drinks quickly, place was redeeming itself. Myself and three of my girlfriends were sitting at the bar next to two gentlemen. My girlfriend happened to make a comment about a sport that was on TV and the guy next to her said \"what are you,ISIS?\" Of course she snapped back. I was sitting right next to her and I didn't even know what was going on and had to ask so it was definitely not belligerent. The bartender immediately went after my girlfriend and wanted her out. My only assumption is those guys were her friends. Regardless unprofessional and disgusting to me. This bar is completely unprofessional and run by a bunch of half-witted women."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because it's a brand new staff or what. But it took far too long to get the food. Tried wings and they are ok but not great. Nachos we're soggy and not thrilling. Beer was good but honestly not cold enough. Back to the staff issue. The waitress brought togo boxes and just took off. Kind of like all the other times she brought something.  After the togo boxes we waited 14 minutes for the check.  I was told the Val Vista location is awesome so I tried this one. Not impressed at all. I doubt I'll come back."}
{"text":"OK, before I get started , i'm going to acknowledge the fact that we arrived here at 10:30 PM, and our waitress had probably been working for a while. I've worked in the food industry for five years, so I know how hectic it can be, and I know how stressful it can be.  My buddies and I got here around 10:30 PM for some wings. We ordered 40 wings. All different kinds of flavors. The food was fantastic. But the service was bad.  As soon as we sat down, our waitress brought us one menu. For the three of us. I had to get up and go get another menu. No big deal right? It wasn't too inconvenient. But it just bothered me a little bit. So she gets back and takes our order, we got a total of 40 wings, I got a Coke, my buddy got a Sprite.  When the food came out, there was a misunderstanding. I got 15 wings, my friend got 15 wings, and my second friend only got 10 wings. But I didn't know that, I thought he got 15 also, like us two. So I told the waitress, I think we're missing five wings. So she starts explaining everybody's order and then I figured it out and asked my buddy \"oh you only got 10 wings?\" And he said \"yeah I only got 10\", and that's when our waitress asks me \"are you fucking with me or what?\" I instantly replied, \"no I'm not fucking with you. I thought that guy ordered five more wings.\" She pats me on the arm like it was a joke, and then walks back to the bar.   You know I figure this is a country bar, so maybe there are some crude jokes going on, maybe professionalism isn't core value here at this restaurant. But none of us ordered alcohol, we were just there to eat, and just enjoy our meal. So even if it was just a joke, I wasn't feeling it.  So then I think to myself, oh well at least they didn't spit in my food. But you see that's not the point, because that's one more thing that shouldn't ever happen. The point is that there was a certain amount of disrespect going on tonight. I felt it heavily. This is not the kind of service that you provide to customers to make them return. It's very unacceptable.  As far as the drinks go, she never came back once to offer a refill. But I didn't make a big deal out of it, I left a tip on my bill, and I walked out of there.  I will most likely return to this location, because the food was absolutely excellent. But if I get the same service that I did tonight in my future visit, you can guarantee that I won't tip, I won't return, and I'm going to update this rating of one star.   I'm really hoping that my future visit changes this review to five stars. As a restaurant manager myself, I think the manager has a lot of work to do, and needs to train his team better."}
{"text":"Truly great wings but slow and spotty service.  Some waitresses are great.  Others are so bad they must have been hired solely because they are young and look good in shorts.  Have been there when they had no napkins and it  can take 40 minutes to get a burger.  This is why the reviews here are bipolar.  One day they earn a 5.  The next day a 1.  It's like Russian Roulette and it shows in these reviews.  Lots of potential but needs better management.    They don't do takeout on 40 cent wing day (Thurs) so you are stuck going inside and hoping for a good waitress and adequate staffing.  Never go here for lunch if you are on a schedule.  You could be in and out in 30 minutes or walking out frustrated in 70.  The wings are awesome, though."}
{"text":"You can't beat their Monday special: $6 cheeseburger with hand cut fries! Delicious! Menu lists daily food specials for a niice variety. Plenty of TVs around so you can catch the game or most sporting event. Additional daily drink specials are decent, unfortunately never feature any premium or imports (come on guys! You're missing out on business over a $1 off a craft draft??).   Service is usually fast, friendly and efficient! Oh, and they usually serve your cold, overflowing beer with a cocktail napkin or coaster!!  By the way, I don't want to forget to give a special mention to their wings. Can we say, PHENOMENAL?? The kids would come here every day just to have wings! And we find ourselves ordering them for pick up quite often!   The issues, and why not a 5 star, are the menus need to be wiped down!! Customers should not have to unstick them!! And I know it's a laid back bar atmosphere but please take extra care wiping down tables and chairs... Ugh! I wish I could do 4.5 stars but since Yelp doesn't allow 1/2 stars the lack of cleanliness just doesn't warrant that right now.."}
{"text":"Great experience. I have always been treated will here since there is new management. I live in mesa but drove down here cuz I know they will have my game on and cheap beer on tap. Me and my fiancee came down to watch the eagles game and i had 3 beers and both had food and was only $20 I would recommend this place anyone"}
{"text":"Very good sports bar in the Mesa! The portions are very large. I went for the basic chicken tenders and fries- buffalo style, and they were great! Highly recommend the garlic knot appetizer. Restaurant was quiet on an off time but gets busy on nights and weekends! Will be back!"}
{"text":"So... Sunday night, and decided that I could not live with out boneless buffalo wings. Since Cogburns ( formerly Payton's Place) is in the hood; why not stop by. Walked through the door and all of three people there. None of them employee's. Waited with my family about 7 minutes until a patron feels bad and try's to give me a menu and seat me. Respectfully, I decline and started to the door. As I opened the door to leave, two employees, one male the other female, come from the kitchen looking at me surprised as if not expecting to work that night. As they pleaded for my family and I to return, all I could think about is how \"not\" busy in the kitchen they were while preparing no ones food. Just saying'! Since opening night the service in this place sucked. Can't say anything about the food because I was never able to get any!"}
{"text":"I have to support this place too - I have no idea why it has so many bad reviews (and reviewers with few reviews). I for one was positively surprised when I was here to have a few brews before I went bowling.   The waitress staff was nice and effective. I have no complaints about them at all. The prices here are decent I must say, as the should based upon the location. if I lived closer I would come here more often for sure.   I smelled the wings, and the smelled very tasty - but I didn't have any because I was on my detox and therefore wings was not on my diet. I will have to try them next time though. For sure.  Sure this place isn't classy, but that has clearly never been the intention. It is not a dive per se, but a bar.. just a bar that have some decent wings.. and decent priced beer. That is what I was looking for and that was what I got. Don't listen to one review haters... come check Cogburns out."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! We came in with a large group. The place wasn't busy but we still had to go ask for menus. We ordered drinks and waited 15 minutes for the waitress to come back and say they didn't have the vodka required to make a drink. Even after this someone ordered potato skins.  they were disgusting. Potato skins disgusting? How hard is that? I ordered another beer and set a timer. 8 minutes!  Afterwards someone went to the bar to investigate the vodka situation. They said they didn't have it until he pointed to the bottle. Stay away!!Incompetent staff and disgusting food."}
{"text":"Service has been hit and miss, but you can tell there's been a change. The servers were hustling and very attentive. Food was good too!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for the last rousey fight on pay per view. Service was slow. Could have been because they were so busy but still feel they should have put more help on. Very large tv in the bar area which was nice. I had wings, BBQ style. They were nothing to write home about. Beers were tasty and served ice cold in frosty mugs, until they ran out and just started reusing the mug you gave them. Not a horrible experience. Would only go back on a night with no event going though."}
{"text":"Just saw this place the other day, close to my house. Good service, lots of beer selections. Wings I had were okay, had better"}
{"text":"Visited 8/3/13 We were hesitant after reviewing several of the review. Quite frankly, the last time we thought about going we changed our minds after we read the reviews.   But in a search for chicken wings, we thought we would risk it.  We were pleasantly surprise!!  The winds came out hot and fresh. They were large and meaty, not fatty.  We had three different orders, Parmesan Garlic, Honey Hot, and straight Medium.  We also ordered house salads which was a nice change with candied walnuts and apples.  I would change to the Balsamic dressing next time.  It does seem to be a trend that places are charging more for Ranch Dressing?  Small little container and only two came out with a order of three sets of wings.  Does Ranch Dressing really cost that much that a chicken wing place cannot supply a nice portion with the wings???  Overall, I we were pleased.  Will likely return and hope to get the same fresh order of wings next time."}
{"text":"Wow! 2 hostesses rolling silverware while we waited over 20 minutes for a beer. We usually go to the Cogburns on Power Rd and that will be the only one we go to from now on. Their wings and service run circles around the Val Vista location."}
{"text":"The place is set up very well for having drinks and watching games. It is definitely one of the more unique layouts for a bar in all of the greater Phoenix area. There is an upstairs and \"basement\" area which can really make the spot very spacious. The servers are very attentive, attractive, and friendly. The only downfall of the place is their lack of efficiency when it comes to serving food. Our 3 dishes were all served less than lukewarm; cold plates always deliver a bland taste. It sounds like they are still relatively new so once all the kinks get worked out this place has the potential to become a well-oiled machine. I would try them again with the hopes they understand the need to be exceptional for the Football Sunday crowd."}
{"text":"Food: was nothing great. I ordered a cheeseburger and it wasn't that great at all. The fries were actually disgusting but I really liked the pickle!!! Service: was great! I loved Brittany. Super friendly and very attentive to our needs:)"}
{"text":"I would never come back to this establishment again. The food is nothing to complain about but the customer service is horrible. They were very rude, and very impatient. Almost felt as if I was inconveniencing them stepping into their location. Pass this place up!!"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook staff is very friendly the food was outstanding atmosphere was great as well highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food is okay. They know how to make a Greatfull Dead (drink .) Service is pleasant but slow at times. The Big Screens are great. Place can get noisy. Outside seating is okay."}
{"text":"Gone are the days when Football Sunday brings good service with good food. I spent my entire 2014 football Sundays at this location. On the first day this year the service was bad. Waited 30 mins in the bar for a blood Mary. I wanted.to order breakfast and 15 mins later still no help. So I got up paid and left. Either the manager needs to hire competent bar tenders or get the junior league bartenders out. The service is what made me average a $60 dollar tab every Sunday."}
{"text":"The service was horrible.... We ordered appetizers which came separately one at a time after approximately 15-20 minutes of sitting at our table. We also had a child with us which we asked to have their meal delivered early. It took approximately 25 minutes for a grilled cheese to be delivered at which point it was cold. When We complained to the waitress she argued with us as to why we were even questioning the quality of the food.  We asked to speak with a manager at which point we were advised that the old manager was fired and that the new manager wasn't working that night. We ordered one of the wraps without onions because the person that was ordering was allergic. The wrap that we received was full of onions. Hey did deliver a new grilled cheese. In the end we received a free grilled cheese and 15% off our total bill. After our experience I don't believe that that was sufficient for the experience that we received. We will never come back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food and great service.  The wings are generous and perfectly cooked.  There are a lot of great beer choices.  I highly recommend this Cogburns!"}
{"text":"So I went to Cogburns last night to have a drink after working to check it out around 10PM.  My bar/grill of choice has typically been Native New Yorker, but Cogburns is so close that I wanted to see if this could be a good alternative for watching the UFC fights with my buddies.  When u went in the bartender was too preoccupied in her conversation with the one waitress there that I had to sit there for 15 minutes before I was acknowledged.  Once acknowledged she apologized because she did not see me...duh you were too busy not paying attention!  So I get a draft, finish it up and want to have one more before closing my tab.  Once again I sat there with an empty mug for another 10 minutes while I wait for her to finish her obviously intense conversation with her coworker.  I think the words customer service do not apply at this place."}
{"text":"\"Meh?\"  Not great, but not awful.  Our waitress was really huffy. My hubs commented to me on how she seemed really short and brisk everytime she came over to us, and I would say that is pretty accurate. This was our first time so we were trying to absorb everything, ie. the decor, seating, and menu options, and she seemed greatly inconvenienced by the fact that it took us -gasp- 5 seconds to decide what to drink.   We ordered 10 \"hot\" wings for $8.  Not a great deal when we fondly reminisce on our favorite, Zipps, which offers 10ish wings for $6 on happy hour Mon-Fri, among other amazing happy hour deals and reasonably priced food even outside of happy hour.  I was disappointed to 1. find a house salad at Cogburn's cost a whopping $7, and 2. realize this was because it included apples, walnuts?, and feta cheese. It seemed like a very \"typical\" sports bar with typical bar fare so this change-up with a house salad just seemed weird and unnecessary to me.  For a place that advertises \"Big Wings\" these wings were not \"BIG\".  The sauce was okay (we ordered hot) but I get tired of the stinginess some of these joints exhibit with their ranch.  Half a plastic thimble full of ranch for 10 wings, gimme a break.  That's almost as bad as Buffalo Wild Wings.  We'll probably be back because the drink specials were cheap, and it's close.  But Meh?"}
{"text":"Came in around 845pm on Wednesday night. Waitress was attentive and responsive. Asked if the television in front of me could be changed when we were sat, the girl said she didn't know how (I appreciate the honesty) and would ask someone to do so. Took a little bit but finally someone remembered. I did not eat, just had a drink, so I cannot review about food, however all my friends finished their wings with no complaints do that is a plus. Atmosphere is good, music on loud enough not to feel dead, since there was not many patrons in the establishment at that hour, but not loud enough to be a distraction. Restaurant was clean. If I come back and eat, review will be updated according to food experience."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Nothing crazy but it's a local bar for sure. We come here a few times a month and I've always left happy. My friends in the East Valley come here for pizza and wings all the time so whenever I visit, this is where we end up. They always have consistent food and drink specials and tons of sports on tv. My girlfriends and I gravitate towards the touchtunes throughout the night and dance (nothing close to a night club but the music is loud and we have fun!) The food is good, dollar bills on the walls, country/rock vibe, and a nice patio with no smoking.. but too far from my home. Maybe they will open one closer to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I missed Payton's place. The service for Cogburns isn't as good at all. Seems to me like wings recipe has changed also. I understand the food price has gone up so they have to keep up with the price which I don't mind paying a little extra for good wings. But the hot wings aren't nearly as hot anymore. Thursday wings price is only good for dine-in only."}
{"text":"Dive bar.. Enough said.. dirty and lacking direction, seems like just a place to get drunk and scream at the games on TV... Boring, wont be back.. slso, what is the strange smell in this place?"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place. They have a great beer selection for him and I can get my lovely cocktails. The food is great too so we go there for the happy hour and stay for the drinks.  Definitely stop by and try it!"}
{"text":"The place good for tailgates football party with today when cardinals vs rams 12:15 PM, honesty The Arizona Cardinals is my favorited team and all I can say \"Go Cardinals!\" Today I will be enjoy my tailgate party and watch cardinals beat up the rams! I highly recommend whomever live in this area should come and enjoy your tailgate party h!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. It had a great atmosphere and a was great place to bring the family. We stopped by on a Thursday when the wings are on sale for 40 cents and even though it was a long wait the wings and pizza were worth it. The manger even came by and apologized for the wait which shows great service. Overall great pizza and wings for a great price"}
{"text":"Would have been nice to have a drink after an 8 hour shift tonight. Instead I wasted my time going to Cogburns. I arrived at about 12:30am, music was still going strong and there was a little crowd in the bar area. There was no bartender behind the bar cause she was hanging out at a table with friends. I walked in and waited at the bar for a good 10 minutes before someone out of the kitchen came by and said \"oh she will be right with you\". HA... No one came by for another 5 minutes.. (Horrible Service)... So I walked out. Im not asking for much, just maybe a drink. This wasnt the first time, but surely the last time I go to Cogburns."}
{"text":"I wanted to at least be fair and update my review as I was contacted by the manager who said my review appeared legitimate.  It was, because I was there!!  He did say he would look into it and address the problem.  It doesn't fix what's taken place, but will hopefully limit these experiences in the future.  Maybe I will give this place another shot, maybe not, but at least someone is trying.  Looking at the reviews, it appears I'm not the only one to have been treated like this.  Good luck, Cogburn's."}
{"text":"I went to watch the CARDS tonight with my husband and friends. First, the waitresses and bartender wouldn't turn on the Arizona Cardinals game because they didn't have permission to change the channel without the owner's permission. There was a big table of Cardinal fans directly in front of the big screen, some people nearby in a booth, us and a neighboring table who all wanted the game on....about 20 people I'd say. Ten minutes after the game was under way, they finally turned on the game on a couple small tvs and we were watching commentary on the big screen for a rained out game because they had already paid for the game....but wait, it gets better: I've got one sip left of my beer and the waitress came and asked one of our male friends if he'd like another and completely ignored me (I'm a woman by the way). Perhaps she thought I wasn't going to tip as well as the men at our table...I won't every return to Cogburns, and probably neither will my family and friends I was with!"}
{"text":"I will actually never return to this location again.  Second bad experience here,  but this one was worse & before we even got a chance to sit down.  We were on a waiting list and since there was no where to sit, we decided to wait outside. An employee (we'll call her l.m., since those were the initials on her hat), finished with her shift came outside and started calling a cab.  She was obviously annoyed with him because when she got off the phone,  she proceeded to call him a mother f*&$@&. A patron she apparently was friendly with went to talk to her and she used the term again to tell her story about the cab driver. We moved away so we didn't have to hear her language.  (Had our 4 year old with us). He asked her to come inside and when she walked by us,  she used the f\":$@ word again.  I said \"hey, come on.\" And pointed to my daughter and instead of actually apologizing,  gave me a back handed response.  This was what she said,  \"I'm sorry,  I work at a bar,  I don't cater to families and kids.\" i told her,  \"they have a kids menu which makes it a family restaurant.\" Her response, \"I'm sorry you're so offended,  but I'm off work and I don't have kids,  so I don't need to watch my mouth\". My husband said to her that since she's still wearing the uniform,  then she's still on the clock.  I went inside and told the hostess to cancel our table since this young lady walking by doesn't care to watch her mouth. The original girl,  says to me that she's actually a manager and I laugh and say really? ! I can't believe that you're a manager! She insists that she's already apologized , we had a few more words and when I walked out,  she yells,  \"wow!\" I said,  \"yes,  I was thinking the exact same thing! \""}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever had! The bar area is small but the service (Jordan) is great!   **** changing my 5 star review to a 2**** Last night (Wednesday/8pm) our experience with the server/bartender was horrible.... she was incredibly rude; she acted put off by taking an order and made sure her customers knew they weren't wanted. One of the most bizarre experiences you'd think you'd find in a neighborhood grill/bar.... and it doesn't look like it was the first when reading some of these other reviews. Super sad cause it's right around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars. Today was last time i will go there. Have been there several times. Service is ok when the night is young. Go early. If you get there after a certain time, wait staff to busy talking to boyfriends to refill a simple water. Beer is eh.  Food is good and the reason we go. Tonight go in and tables were removed and were told \"standing room only\".  Who made that business decision? So youd rather sell a beer over a meal and a beer, just put the tables back. Good riddance...."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the wings and the waiters are so friendly. Love the military flags! Brings a great moral in the restaurant! Thank you"}
{"text":"Food is not bad at all. Can't go wrong with their wings! Service on the other hand is not the best. They always seemed understaffed but I've never met a place with 3 or more hostesses..? Meanwhile our server is running around crazy and the person at the bar had to personally bring us our drinks.  Great place to hang out on a Friday night, for those who want to check out Cogburns. Not my first choice, but I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"Deserves less than 1 star.  Very few people there.  No hostess to seat us.  After a long wait we were finally seated.  No one came to take our order.  Another group was trying to find someone to pay their bill.   We left.  Will not go back to find out if the food is good.  Not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and very good wings.  Preferred the BBQ flavored wings over the salt and pepper which were a very salty. The homemade chips are a favorite side."}
{"text":"THE place to go if you like chicken wings. Great flavors and big wings and drumsticks. Cold beer and good service to boot. I have eaten here numerous times and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Not a great place. Horrible setup. Staff is nowhere to be found. Wings are overpriced. If you like Bra's hanging all around you, maybe you'll like the setup"}
{"text":"Came into this relatively empty place. Had lots of tvs and a good vibe. I sat down and got a beer...that's where it went south. The servers are not pleasant and are very inattentive.  I asked how the tacos were ($1 on Tuesdays) and the sever looked at me and said, \"they're tacos\". Got blue cheese when I asked for ranch. Couldn't beg them for a second beer, had to go up to the bar to get it.  Yes, they are pretty servers. I hope you enjoy your $1 tip on a $40 bill beautiful."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place a few weeks ago, not sure if they had been open very long.  I am guessing by the quality of service, they were still breaking in. Ordered wings, salads and a few draft beers.  My wife's beer was flat, and it took 15 minutes to swap kegs for my beer.  Menu price was different then what the wait staff told us.  I guess there was a mis print on the menu and they explained it would be more expensive then what the menu stated. (I'm guessing they could have had it corrected, reprinted, redacted, ) and just honored the price. (Am I to critical?) We were seated in the very lower level with very little air circulation.  The wing sauce was not what I was used to, it was ok but not that red thick wing sauce.  Wings were big and juicy. We plan to revisit once the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"The absolute worst restaurant experience I've ever had. We sat waiting for our check for 40 minutes while servers literally SAT at a table with two guys who were clearly not working and enjoying their night, at the table right next to us. While they were standing right next to our table (less than two feet away) they decided to bash a previous table talking about how they should have thrown the check at them because of how rude they are and how they should have fought them. That's absolutely fucking disgusting being in the industry and hearing that about another table that is a PAYING CUSTOMER. Your customer service is horrible. Your servers are complete trash. Absolutely never ever again. I am so disgusted."}
{"text":"Yummy GIGANTIC wings!! Could've been a bit spicier (hot were more medium, IMO) great service too!"}
{"text":"Last couple times we ate here the service keeps getting worse. They weren't even busy when we were here and our waitress only checked on us once. She was too busy chatting with Co workers who had nothing to do.  The food was good, but not as good as it used to be, and beer was warm- even after we repeatedly asked for an ice cold beer."}
{"text":"good food, great looking waitresses, good selection of beer as well!! have been here a few times and had turkey burger with grilled apples and brie cheese, delicious! the southwestern burger with the green chile and bacon, and also the wings were great! and decent price on thursday,, where always will order double since only .55 cents ea... recommend as a great hangout with the guys but did notice large families with kids as well, so nice for all. have plenty of tvs and sports on.!"}
{"text":"Aaaawful service.  Literally would have had a pack of me monkeys remember more of any thing I ordered.  Yes, it requires silverware to eat a salad.  No, I shouldn't have to ask.  Food is just . . . Meh.  I really wish this place was better, based on location.  They're screwing up a huge opportunity."}
{"text":"This place has great wings!   Especially in Thursday when they are only $0.55   The wings are a good size and they offer a good variety of flavors. There are TVs in the bar and lobby so it's easy to catch a game here.   The atmosphere is part country, part biker gang, and semi hipster."}
{"text":"Came here for a charity poker tournament and enjoyed the environment.  Grouchy old guys watching football, bros hanging and watching games, the waitresses were friendly and the beer was cold.  More a country flare about the place, but welcoming.  Be back soon.  Wife: The hubby was excited to take me to this restaurant on 1/26/2017 because he enjoyed the country ambience this place has to offer.  This bar/restaurant has a lot of character.  Loved the clever name for their alcohol menu, \"Pour Decision\".  We ordered our usual, bbq, parmesan garlic and medium wings.  Their bbq wings were probably the best we've had of the 5 places we visited in the last couple weeks.  They were big, juicy and generously coated with sauce.  The other wing flavors were also just as meaty, however, they could have used a little bit more sauce.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the place.  I would definitely take the kids to this place."}
{"text":"Good food, great patio, wings are awesome. We live close by and this is a great neighborhood bar. Doesnt have that \"chain\" bar feel like native or buffalo wild. Just a great local hangout. Lots of beer on tap and friendly and knowledgable bartenders."}
{"text":"My first day in Arizona...  Drunken shrimp is fantastic but I wish they threw in a couple more pieces of bread for dipping in the sauce.  Bloody Mary is spot on and I'm a Bloody Mary snob.  Good selection of beers for those of us that are not IPA fans.  Molly is the first person I've met here in Arizona. She is a good hostess and she made sure I didn't use my fingers because silverware was \"provided for a reason.\" :)  I like her style and she's one of many reasons why this will be my new watering hole."}
{"text":"Food is worse than you would expect for a bar like this. Didn't have high expectations at all and it was still bad. Service was slow. Our table was the one that time forgot. Shame of me for giving the place a second try. If you only want to drink, its probably OK. Next time I'll just go to Flipside."}
{"text":"This place is easily the best place for wings and sports in the area!  TVs all over the place are huge for anyone playing fantasy football.  I sat here all day on a Saturday for college football and it was such a great place to watch games I came back the following Sunday for pro games.    Wait staff is great and very helpful even if something goes a little wrong.  Quick to fix anything.  UFC fight was free too!  Where else you find that in the East Valley these days?  They treat me great everytime, definitely recommend Cogburns."}
{"text":"Why does it smell so bad in this bar? The sound system is so crazy loud, you can't hear anyone speaking. The food takes forever to get to your table. Crazy prices for drinks. And did I say that it smells!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere new to watch the UFC fight we were unaware that Payton's place closed an reopened as \"cogburns\". So we decided to check it out...   Let me just start out by saying that Ashley was the only saving grace. The bartenders were very unknowledgeable and lack personality. My boyfriend always drinks margaritas on the rocks no salt. They girl that took our order did not make his drink which made me think she didn't know how... When he got it, it had salt and so she remade it.... The 2nd one came and it was made with grapefruit juice... And the part that kills me is that she knew she had used grapefruit and still served it! So now upon getting his 3rd drink... We grabbed a table in the dining area since the asu game was on the big tv... Still kept getting margs made with grapefruit, wings were ok... I dont think waste my money here..."}
{"text":"Sports bars are my thing I have my favorites but tonight I met some friends here....  We were there to watch the UFC fight so just about every table was packed but they need to plan for that cause in the 2 hours I was there I only seen the waitress 3 times. Our table was about to leave without paying cause the fight was over and still waiting for our waitress to come to our table.   Rewind........My friends were sitting upstairs and had already ate some food so I didnt get a chance to taste before I ordered my own. I ordered 15 wings that were not too pricey and I ordered them \"HOT\" when the wings came I want to say that they were \"Honey BBQ\" or maybe \"Honey HOT\" def not a hot sauce. I have learned never send food back on a busy night.....use your imagination. I ate cause I was hungry, less than 40 mins later my stomach was bubbling like crazy and I need to use the rest room 4 times over the next 10 hours. They must have something in their chicken or old greese but these wings did not agree with me.   The TVs there are also some no name brand which is ok if you plan to fill a bar with them but the one we were sitting next to had red spots, sparkles, burn in....it just made my eyes water.   This is my first and last trip to this bar, left a bad taste in my mouth and many trips to the bathroom."}
{"text":"What a terrific place :)  I went in with another person for a \"working lunch\" this afternoon.  The service was great, the food was terrific (the bbq roast beef sliders were outstanding), and my ice tea glass was full.  We stuck around for a couple of hours and the waitress was nothing less than friendly and helpful.  Then there's all the TVs!  I can't wait to come back with the hubby to watch football, try some more of the food and drink a few beers.  It was a bit empty - I hope that everyone in the area gives it a try for themselves so it can have a chance to survive.  The proximity to the ASU Polytechnic campus is huge - not much like it that close to campus.  Seems like a no-brainer for the college kids."}
{"text":"Must come! The wings are huge and you can dress them in 15 different flavors! All the girls here are very pretty, but ask for Julia. She is the best :)"}
{"text":"Wings are large and the sauces/rubs are generally tasty. Our server was ok, 3 people ordered beers and all 3 were warm, glasses came out warm to the touch, we added ice, yeah ice in a beer. If you grab a brew go with a bottle. The fish fry was bland and everyone's food came out warm, no one had a hot dish served to them so if you're a kid it's cool because you don't need to blow on your food to cool it down, if your an adult the place kinda sucks. This is like like native grill and wings with smaller wings and colder food, meh."}
{"text":"Cogburns is awesome!!!!!! The staff is always so friendly.  The food is incredible!!!! The wings and onion rings are always a must have for us!!!!"}
{"text":"They play music during football and its bright....not sure what the deal is but having the commentators on AND music is a weird conflict. Bartenders boyfriends hang at the bars so be prepared for a stare down or shit talking if you flirt or are overly nice with the bartenders. I would shy away..."}
{"text":"This location is closer to our house but we'll definitely be driving a little out of our way next time to go to the other Gilbert location. Nothing was consistent. One large beer came out in a cold mug...one didn't. One bloody Mary came out in a pint glass...one came out in a glass half the size. The waitresses walking around all looked unhappy. The food wasnt great....except for the wings. The vegetables I requested for my son all were wilted and looked like they had been sitting out for a couple days. The atmosphere just wasnt inviting.  Complete opposite experience that we had at the other Gilbert location."}
{"text":"I was in on Thursday night and it seemed obvious that once you become a regular you get great service. But, until then good luck. 2 bartenders and 5 customers at 11 pm and I had to walk up to the bar for drinks or to get their attention."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? I love this place,  the service and food but come on now. We are here all the time. ..Who's decision was to put the  Chicago Bears game on the big screen vs the Cardinals. Unfortunately 3 tables of people got pissed off and just left. ..we may do the same...."}
{"text":"I have been back several times since our first negative experience and I have not encountered any further issues.  I felt compelled to write this update because I typically go for UFC fights, i.e. at busy times, and I have always had pretty solid service and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I'm glad I gave them another shot after the first less than desirable visit because it has become my go to place for UFC if I don't buy the PPV myself."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times. The prices are high and the personality is low. Couldn't rate the food, never offered a menu and the server/bartender never spoke again to ask for one  until I flagged them down to pay my bill.  Lots of better choices out there for me to come back."}
{"text":"Really want to like this place. Wings are very good. Drinks are decent as well. If you go here you need to sit in the bar.  The girls up front that are \"Suppose\" to greet  you are horrible. I have never felt so unwelcome in any business in my life. Very Nasty little girls.  We have been her  at least 15 times and it's always the same. We go for the wings and to sit in the bar. But it the bar is full, watch out. You are about to be treated like a garbage. And service when the waitress is very slow and unorganized . You better order 5 or 6 beers when you sit down because the girl won't be back ."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere gets a four and I will def be coming back for their PILED HIGH nachos and they weren't kidding with their HUGE \"big wings\" delish!   I give service a 5 star to my waitress (which I am so sad I can't remember her name) with blonde hair and a flannel around her waist for being so attentive to my boyfriend and was super polite, not to mention I always had a cold brew in front of me! If your reading this blondie you rock!!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Meh. The energy at this location is so low and uninviting. We ordered twenty wings today and were given a small stack of cocktail napkins and had to ask for regular napkins. They advertise large wings and these wings were no different or bigger than anywhere else. We frequent the Cooper/Warner location and the experience is very different with regard to staff attitude.....and it could be that they know we spend a lot when we go and they want us to come back...... not sure but Mesa won't receive my business anymore."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for a few drinks and appetizers. Our service was horrible. We waited maybe 30 mins for a menu before my boyfriend went to the bar and asked for one.   The server/bar tender looked like she used some type of hard drugs and was out of it. I'm not sure if this may have been the reason out service was lacking significantly.   Our food was burnt and flavorless. We also asked for a side of fries and ended up with this huge plate piled high with soggy fries which ended up being $6-7!!!! This was insane considering we asked for a side order or fries.  I wasn't expecting much from this place but really? Will not be back."}
{"text":"Holy horrible. Just keep on walking past and eat at the dry cleaners. It'll be more appetizing. It all started when we sat down and the soda was lacking carbonation. We were going to order pizza and wings but were told the oven doesn't work and that pizza wasn't an option. So we figured we would just order their specialty, chicken wings!  Ummmm that's your specialty?? They weren't very good at all.  It even says on the menu that they're pro steroids in the chicken. That's how they're \"big\". I didn't think they were any bigger than anywhere else and it was a little unappetizing bragging that they buy steroid injected chicken. The service was definitely rough around the edges. The waitress slammed the refill drink down with a thud as she ran past. I guess I did get a refill. That must count for something.  Definitely won't see the inside of this place again."}
{"text":"Wings were big but I will be ordering the HOT next time as the medium wings were weak. My sister ordered the kid's cheeseburger and fries and both were very good. We didn't see our server much during our meal and had to flag her down a couple of times, otherwise I would have given this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been here four times and every time it's just yucky the girl that served us is obviously on drugs. Deer in the headlight and can't stop twitching. The place just gives a vibe of being dirty not that it shows that it's dirty not sure what it is I just don't like it here. It's like they're trying to do a Hooters but it's just not working"}
{"text":"I went to Cogburns because they were pet friendly and looked interesting. I liked the daily specials and beverages. I had garlic and Parmesan wings out of about 10 choices. It was good and Mexican beers were the special that day. It was good and I plan to go back."}
{"text":"Man, I saw that Cogburns has a two and one half star rating here and I could not believe it. Listen to me people! Those bad ratings are dead wrong. Cogburns serves up the best food you will ever get...EVER. I can easily prove my point. Just go get a Cogburns grilled chicken sandwich. I mean it! Just go get one and here's what WILL happen. You'll bite into it and taste the most tender best spiced chicken breast you have ever had. It's HUGE! It flops over the side of the bun so much it's almost funny. Twice as big as most. That tender buttery breast is covered with savory creamy white cheese which is melted right in. It comes with bacon too. I have that removed for health reasons (but sometimes I conveniently forget...). The specialty bun is perfect. Definitely not your average plain Jane white bread. First bite this buttery perfection melts into your mouth and destroys all the other chicken sandwiches you've had up to this point. You'll became a Cogburn addict like I am. But wait there's more. They have a turkey burger that my wife absolutely loves. It has a special designer sauce atop the patty, apples and a brie cheese. What bar serves something like this? They serve pizza too. We get it with double mushrooms. The cheese is obviously very high end and when you mix it with tender mushrooms and perfect crust and sauce...omg. But lets get to the wings. 49 cent's every Thursday and very cheap every other day too. This is what originally hooked us. The place is actually called Cogburns BIG wings and no joke they are HUGE. These guys are chicken wing masters. We love the Honey BBQ, Garlic Parmesan, the Teriyaki, and the Honey Mustard. We get 3 orders of different types on wing night which results in a variety in flavor that is simply our favorite meal. That's a $7.50 meal for two that is a gut buster because they are SO big. Leaves lots of change to buy a bunch of specialty beers from their WALL of taps. They have BIG beer choice. All the good locals and the great Europeans. You can get Corona bottles for $2 on wing night and $2.50 domestic drafts Sundays when their special is wings and greens - 5 wings and a good sized salad ($5). This is the best bar for food ever. They have walls of TVs and a great sound system. It's THE place to go when your hungry because it IS simply the best. It's 10 star good. Anything less than 5 stars is wrong. If you want proof - go get a chicken sandwich. You'll become addicted. I forget to mention they make their own ranch dressing from scratch. You have never had dressing like this. Beyond words - there is simply nothing like it. It's so good. It comes with the wings and it makes all their salads something really special. Special is the word for this truly fine restaurant and bar. I forgot one last thing. The waitresses are the most beautiful women and the sweetest too. Go to a bar that gets to know you, I love it when they already know what I want down to the smallest details...every time. They are extraordinary."}
{"text":"It started with a rude waitress who stopped in the middle of taking our order to have a full conversation with a drunk customer. Then, she lied to us about making out with Kevin Skaff. THE DISRESPECT. When asked about the food, she told us that even though she had been working here for three weeks and didn't know the menu. Finally our food came-the pizza literally dripped with grease, and there was like two drops of sauce on a whole pizza. The marinara sauce that came with the mozzarella sticks was INEDIBLE it was so gross."}
{"text":"Saturday specials include $2.25 domestic bottles and $3 pizza slices. Pizza slice is pretty big, not bad for 3 bucks. Place is clean with a ton of TVs. Turkado sandwich was good. Onion rings are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible!!  My wings were burnt and not good.  However, my husband thought his wings were pretty good.  It was hot and stuffy in the restaurant.   Kids meals are a little over priced and dessert is majorly over priced.  I got cheese cake for dessert which was $8.  I was expecting a slice close to the cheesecake factory and I got a tiny piece of old cheesecake. Overall, we will not be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Literally they are blaring pop music so loud right now. It's piercing my ears and the guy next to me. Can't... even... eat. The wings are epic here but good lord. Turn that music down."}
{"text":"Food has me feeling like crap the whole next day, no refills, 50.00 for what looked like a crappy burger I would find on the kids menu at mcdonalds. we will not be back..."}
{"text":"Some of the negative reviews must have been because they were working out the kinks.  Because I just visited Cogburns and had a great time!  The drinks were cold, the food was great (I had the wings) and they came out quick.  The wait staff was very attentive and I never had to wait for a drink order.  By the way, the women that work here are very attractive,  think Tilted Kilt.  They had all the games on and there were televisions wherever you looked, not a bad seat in the house.  I can't wait to go back for football!  If you're in the area,  do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"1st time here and met a friend from out of town while our kids hung out at Flipside. We enjoyed Happy Hour prices and excellent fast service by our server.  Like other reviews, their wings are awesome and very meaty, worth the higher price of other restaurants.  will definitely be back as this location is near my house."}
{"text":"this place rocks! everyone is very cool and the food is awesome, especially the Thursday night 49 cent wings!!! Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Cool setup. We went in on a Saturday afternoon to kill time during a soccer tournament and we were the only ones in there. Server forgot our chips and salsa and the food took forever. She was very nice and owned up to her errors, which I appreciate. Since we had a few hours between games all this was fine. Would not recommend for anyone in a hurry."}
{"text":"I'm currently writing this review sitting at a table here at the good ole Cogburn's... haven't seen our waitress in over twenty minutes (she's literally the only server here on a Sunday afternoon at lunch time?) I had to actually send my sister home with my kids because if you've ever had horrible service out and have small kids you know that every minute is precious and 40 minutes sitting in a high chair waiting for food is a recipe for a meltdown. When our order did finally come two items were simply wrong and not what we ordered but at that point she only gave us the option to wait an unknown amount of time for the right order... so a southwestern burger will have to do instead. I would have rated this place a zero but that wasn't even an option. I sent my card and a full priced bill (even for the items we didn't ask for and were incorrect) back to be settled with her twenty minutes ago so who knows what's going on now... just looking forward to the moment I can walk out of this place and never return."}
{"text":"We weren't there with the family for some wings.  It was really loud. Hard to spend quality time with the family.  The wings were great. We tried four different sauces.  You can taste the homemade in them very good. Even the fries were good. I thought the staff was good. One of the \"investors\" stopped by to make sure  we were doing good. Next time I am leaving the kids at home."}
{"text":"My wife and decided to give this place a try, We are always looking for  fun new (non-chain) restaurants. This place was great, Love the layout...They have a nice upstairs area overlooking the bar and many tv screens, and the food was delicious. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the service could be a little better. They were not crowded when we arrived yet it took almost 10 minutes for a waitress to come over."}
{"text":"We frequent this bar with our family.  We have always has a good experience.  The food is really good - especially the burger and the fries are fantastic($6 burger and fries on Monday)! We love the daily specials, taco Tuesday is a great deal ($1!) and the tacos surprisingly good. We love that this place is so close to us. Overall, great place to grab a drink and some food - kid friendly as well."}
{"text":"Owner is extremely rude. If you want to be disrespected then this is the place for you. Food isn't great either. If I could give less than 1 star I would"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area so we are shopping for our new favorite go-to places.  We have been thoroughly impressed with every visit so far! The waitress recommended the turkado, which is now my all-time favorite sandwich.  We've taken advantage of the daily specials many times and have not been disappointed. I love the cilantro in the cole slaw and could happily eat their BBQ sliders every day.  The waitresses are attentive and keep our drinks full.  Great casual place with reliably good food and service at great prices."}
{"text":"They put on yelp 5$ off if you spend 20 or more and when you go there they will say can't used with the wings cause already on special ,well on the yelp didn't say don't used with special, I used it before but now they say no. And they charge 50c for Ranch !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Cogburn's for their New Years Eve party and to see our friends band play for the night. The services wasn't bad at the beginning of the night, and the wings were great. As the night went on the service got worse and several of the servers seemed to getting drunk with one ending up spilling champagne on us and the people next to us.   When we cashed out, we got one bill with the correct charge on it, later to find out by checking our online banking that we were charged TWICE, once for the correct amount and then a second time for a much larger incorrect amount. Friends of our that were there the same night had the same issue of being double and over charged and even had items on their bills that they didn't order. We called in about our double charge and were told it was a mistake and the transaction was voided for us, but it is still unresolved and hasn't been refunded. Our friend on the other hand was not told it was voided or a mistake for their incorrect charges.   Shady business, wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You can get great wings without the hassle elsewhere."}
{"text":"So hot! Asked them to turn down the air but nope. It was a cool 86 degrease in there while watching the fight. On top of that they made my lemon drop martini without sugar which is the easiest drink to make. Way too hot to ever come back.."}
{"text":"Just had the wings (mild) and a philly cheese steak sandwich, not bad at all! Great service and good music, they played Prince..RIP! Good family environment, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp filtered my last review, not sure why.  My review is legit.  Go to filtered reviews to get my take on Cogburn's."}
{"text":"Mariah is totally awesome. I think her name is Mariah V. She is the the most amazing waitress. Very attentive, friendly and professional. She is the reason I come back to Cogburns. The service is great! Best bar food around. I will be returning! Morgan totally rocks. Love this staff!"}
{"text":"BAD BAD BAD!!! Need I honestly say more?? Bad service and bad wings!! What else would I go for?!?!? Wings taste like the Kroger brand hot sauce. Do yourself a favor and go to Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but was very disappointed. I took my family (5 total) on a Sunday midday. We were seated upstairs (they were not that busy) and aside from the fact that our drinks were usually full that's where the good service ended. Food was not well staged, appetizers came out the same time as some entrees and then the remaining items trickled in. Asked for extra BBQ sauce for the dry sliders; we were told it was .50 and then it never came. The server came back to other parties several times before getting back to us. Everything was slow. We won't be back."}
{"text":"First time there. Overall impressions were GREAT. The wings were very good. I went with my two brother-in-laws for Thursday night football yesterday (Denver/K.C.) and to our surprise it was $0.49 wing night. The hostesses and waitresses were all very nice and attentive. Now here is the reason for the THREE stars... HOWEVER, the manager on duty that evening was a total D-bag. First, he walks over to our waitress, as she is helping us and taking OUR orders, and basically yells at her that there is another table \"over there, in case you didn't know\". Then a little while later he comes to our table and starts talking to us and says, \"The \"girls\" really screwed up and shouldn't have sat you here... someone reserved these tables\" and kept going on and on and on about basically how \"dumb and incompetent\" the hostess and waitresses are... To the customer?? Really!? First-off, even if they did make a mistake, not a big deal... and please take the blame as a manager/company, like, \"WE messed up, would you mind if we can reseat you, as these tables were reserved?\" Don't sound petty and blame everything on the staff. Maybe you should go back to not being in management... if you're the OWNER.. then, that is no good for Cogburns' future...  Other than the making the atmosphere VERY awkward for the customer, the food, waitresses/hosts were very good. We'll definitely go back as there are TONS of TVs and a great atmosphere when the manager isn't being a BAD manager."}
{"text":"The 49 wings on Thursday is worth the trip. Great service Wings more tasty and good size. Food was serve hot and fast.  Got my vote to return."}
{"text":"Took the advice of another reviewer and ordered the rasberry chipolte wings which were really tasty...sounds like a variety of their wings are good.  And yes, the bartenders laziness and lack of personality was a real downer.  It's not good to be sarcastic when someone in your group orders water, then to wait for menu's to only be told they would have been brought to us, not true.  May go back sometime and try other wings but isn't urgent on my list."}
{"text":"Was receiving fliers for this place so convinced my friend to try it out with me since we both like eye candy with good food. Got there no one to sit us cause only one waitress and she was also receptionist.  Manager there but not so friendly, oh yeah she was friendly but only to her family who was eating there (probably for free). To keep review short: food average, service below average, staff poor, eye candy zero. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been to Cogburns and there have been open seats/booths and were told it would be a wait. Well, tonight we were told we could hang out in the bar area and just \"Wait\" for something to open.... Completely disappointed and not at all professional.   Now I still have them two stars, because we've been there more then this, overall, the service Isn't horrible and the food is actually pretty good. I'm just hoping their hostess staff could get it together and been more Helpful and inviting. There aren't a lot of joints like this where we live, and we do go out of our way for Cogburns, I just hope this doesn't happen a third time..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, especially about the service. A bunch of us went there to see a UFC fight and the placed was packed! There weren't any tables left but their front patio (they have 2 patios, the front one is smoke free) had a lot of space for standing. The waitress saw us standing, took our order, and offered to find us bar stools, as well. She was very attentive and great.   Nonetheless, we put our name in for a table inside since we still had a few more friends coming. The hostess informed us that getting a table may not happen but that they will try. Sure enough 30 minutes later a table opened up and we were seated. The outside waitress was amazing and closed us out and transferred us without any problems or attitude.   The inside waitress was great, too! She saw that we were a pretty big group and we tend to be somewhat demande, yet fun, so she had a second waitress to wait on us. Our beers never sat empty and the two of them were very very attentive and a lot of fun. And the food was excellent!  This place is great and located in a location that needs more of these kinds of places. Please give them a chance if you are in the neighborhood. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest local hangouts in Gilbert. The staff here always knows what I want before even sitting down thank you  Cogburns for your excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Wings are usually soggy and the people that answer the phone seem like they'd rather jump off a cliff. If you want something average and your expectations aren't very high, I guess this place is for you...."}
{"text":"Went in today because it was a recommendation from one of my wife's coworkers to go try this place. I love wings one of my most favorite things to eat which is what this places is supposedly famous for. The wings weren't as big as the menu claims even though they did have a lot of meat on them. The ranch and sauce covering the wings were very thin and runny as well as I when I asked for the hottest ones they had they compared to a medium sauce anywhere else I've been. I did enjoy the friendly service which never let my cup get half empty and the batter dipped onion rings which are another one of my favorite things to snack on. I would recommend the onion rings and the service but not much else about the place."}
{"text":"Always terrible service and the food is never great.  The plus side is it's the only place in the area"}
{"text":"Really terrible customer service  Walked up with a friend on a \"busy\" Saturday night (no wait at the door, but no open tables). The 3 hostesses stood there staring at us - no \"Hi\", no \"Welcome to Cogburns\"... nothing. I said \"hi, there's 2 of us\" and she said \"We're full. You can check outside\". That was my first clue on their bad service. We ended up sitting outside, under their misters which spewed so much water that we literally had to drag our heavy table to the other end of the patio because our hair, clothes, and even our menus were getting soaked. The waitress watched us dragging our table and didn't offer to help or even comment on the situation. She checked on us during our stay a fair amount until the end of the night came. We sat with empty glasses and plates for almost 20 minutes before she came by to see if we wanted anything else. Then it took another 10 minutes to bring the bill (the place was empty by this point in the night). Then, after waiting 10 minutes with our credit cards on the table, I had to take them inside myself to try and find the waitress. Aaaaand where did I find her? Just inside the door talking to a friend loudly about a relationship issue she was having. She looked at me like I was being rude asking her to run my credit card.   My note to the owners of Cogburns: talk to your young staff members about the importance of customer service. Decent food will only get you so far. There are several other bars I'm the East Valley with equal or better food quality with customer service that surpasses what your staff is offering.   The 2nd star was given for the wings. They were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The raspberry chipotle sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"Slow service! Waited 45 minutes to get my food. On top of that, I came to watch my football team of Sunday. They directed me to the TV it's on. After half time they switch the game to the football game that is already projected on the big screen. I asked them if they can switch it back since the game is already on 7 other tv's. Nope. Of course not. I'm out never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"This review is being written after several visits at various times. This is a fair place for grabbing a bite to eat. There are definite areas that can be improved upon.  The reviews here at yelp are like a roller coaster.  There is somewhat of a theme \"western with Sexy Cowgirls\"; but then there is I want to be a biker bar twist.  I like the \"Sexy Cowgirl and the owner should focus on that theme. The girls like to visit \"the regulars\", not the new Customers, they get lost in conversation and seem upset because they have to serve someone else besides their regular Customer (who knows that person could become a regular customer).The owner does this to, he'll walk right by new Customer's to talk to regulars and not even as much as a quick stop to say hi and see if everything was good. This place with some tweaks with the menu and product and the overall attitude of the staff this place could be an awesome destination for the many potential new Customers. Changed the name of the place, dressed the staff different but left a few crumbs on the table that if taken care of could be a good destination for a nice burger and/or wings. And of course an exlir of your choosing."}
{"text":"Becoming our go to bar  Food is consistently good. Fresh cut french fries which are always made to order and not sitting around under a heat lamp The beer is cold and they have a reasonable selection Service is good Good place to watch football"}
{"text":"Nothing special, french fries are really good Lot of regulars If you want a burger and fries worth visiting"}
{"text":"We came for a do-over after Wing Stock. The wings are good, check out my pics. There are TVs everywhere. Wish I lived closer, I would hit this place more often. The service was okay, seemed to be a lot of regulars demanding way too much attention, but I think sometimes that is me, so I let it slide. Cold beer. Hot wings. Yum."}
{"text":"I'd like to start this saying that my original review was going to be extremely positive but my experience went from amazing to downright ridiculous. Sam is amazing, she was a great bartender. Excellent customer service. Food and drinks were both awesome. When she was moving to be a server Courtney came on. She asked every male customer at the bar if they needed a drink and completely ignored the two females (me and my friend). We ended up just leaving. Went back after a couple hours to get wings and pizza to go, she was rude, it took over 30 minutes to get our food, we got drinks while we waited and she never asked if we needed another one. When my friend approached her to just ask for a refund some guy sitting at the bar that Courtney was too busy talking to started laughing at my friend. The food came out during this time and she set it on a side table instead of handing it to us. No apology about the wait or anything. So even tho I like the place, the food and the drinks, I will not be back because of Courtney. She needs to be retrained or something. Probably one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"We ordered wings for take out, which they had then ready really fast, but they were horrible. Waste of money if you're looking for good wings."}
{"text":"Good experience.  We started with the chicken quesadilla and some drinks.  We Each had wings.  Service was average.  Wings were good and meaty.  Not a bunch breading like other places.  Dessert was the cookie and ice cream thing which was outstanding.   Price was good and for a Saturday evening the crowd was pleasant."}
{"text":"One afternoon I tried to order some food for pick up and waited 45 minutes for someone to take my order, I just hung up. I live next door and I know they are never busy. This place has the worst customer service. I hope the food is good ha."}
{"text":"Since we weren't impressed with service or food during last visit about seven months ag, we were hesitant to try again with my daughter and her husband. I'm glad we gave Cogburn's another try. The food was much better and the service (thank you Ariana) was great!   My daughter likes their hot wings, we ordered a cheese pizza to start. It was okay. I ordered the onion rings and a shrimp dish. I really enjoyed both the onion rings and the shrimp dish! Just a note the shrimp dish, is a bit spicy.  Ariana was a great waitress, beers were always full, she remained attentive to our table. She had a great sense of humor, even after we ordered multiple items from the menu! She was nice enough to sign our son's cast and take pictures with him and the rest of the Cogburn's girls!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight. We were greeted right away and seated. Our server came within a minute and checked in on us frequently. Food was good, the wings being the best part of dinner. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been going here (Val vista location) for years. Looks to me that the owner has just given up on the place. It's run down and dirty. The girls bathroom has been down to one stall for a long time and they don't even bother putting the paper towel in the dispenser anymore. Bartenders are more interested in socializing with friends then serving.  Service is extremely rude and very, very slow. The food has gone way down hill and looking at how dirty and run down the place has gotten it is almost scary to even think of eating there."}
{"text":"So.. I was skeptical because the reviews on here aren't so nice. But I promised myself that from now on, when I have a good experience, I'd talk about it. We decided to get some takeout tonight.  Since I just got the coupon Cogburns sent out in that coupon pack in the mail, we figured we'd try them out. Pretty much the only way it's going to happen since our three girls aren't exactly thrilled to hang out at what is basically a bar.   Called it in and the girl was super nice. I ordered 10 hot wings, 10 mild with light sauce, an order of the french fries, extra ranch and a dr. pepper. My husband picked it up and reports that not one, but 3 people talked with him to make sure he was being taken care of (better than Buffalo Bills Wild Wings btw.. where you can wait about an hour for takeout and people ignore you).   So not only did they not forget the soda (which most every restaurant DOES when you ask for one for takeout), but they remember the extra ranch and that one was supposed to be light sauce.   The wings themselves were a bit spicier than I like. Not their fault, I'm just a wimp. The wings were meaty and flavorful. Maybe a bit saltier than needed. I should have ordered bbq. I'm just such a wimp when it comes to spice. My hubby says his wings were delicious, he likes spicy!   The fries were very very good! I'm not normally a huge fan of those 'fresh cut\" style fries, but these were tasty. They put a couple tubs of ketchup in with the fries, so it wasn't cold ketchup, which I appreciate. Nothing like using cold ketchup on hot food. But the thing I love is that I didn't eat any of the fries until I'd finished my wings and while they weren't hot, they were still darned good. Not soggy, or hard at all. Still mildly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   So all in all, when we're craving wings we'll be back. I don't normally write reviews.. it's hard to find time. But this place has been skewered with bad reviews lately, and I wanted to throw my experience is there as a positive review, for both the food and the service. Trying to support the local places.."}
{"text":"The staff is great. Super food! Ryan is a great guy. Graet place to watch sports.  Looking forward to playing holdem."}
{"text":"I meet a friend here for a business lunch. Probably not a good location choice.  It was poorly lit and the music was rather loud. I felt like I have to talk REALLY loud.  We ordered nachos and it arrived to the table dripping in Chili. They were so nasty tasting that neither of us could eat them. This may be a decent place to watch a sports game and grab a drink however it certainly is not a lunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"We've been a fan of Cogburns for years until this last visit. The sever did not get our order correct the food came out wrong and rather than starting over and giving us a new plate they took our existing plate and made it worse. Rather than comping the meal we were forced to order something else so we tried ording something simple, we ordered the pizza \"crisp\" when the pizza crisp came out it was far from crisp it was soggy. When confronting the server about this there was no suggested correction we mentioned showing the cooks how our order was served she simply turned and thru it in the trash. This may not be a direct reflection on Cogburns but it certainly is a reflection on there service. We will not be returning or recommending this place again."}
{"text":"Before handing the waitress my card, we went over what my family had. I got my receipt and handed the waitress my card to pay. Then, Random food items got charged to my card. I did bring to their attention that they incorrectly charged my card.They gave acknowledgement this was done with intention. I guess they thought I wouldn't catch it...?wtf!????!?"}
{"text":"Service sucks due to serve lack of staffing. One sweet hard working girl to run the entire bar during a The O H-I-O State game on Saturday... did I mention a busy college football day and there is a FULl BAR!!! She did not even have a Barback. Who does that to their employees?  Clearly poor management & owners   Now onto food: $5 poppers - not impressed Kids burger so so but lots of yummy fries served with it.  Wings were cooked great but so so in flavor.   Quesadilla was good, I ordered it with out corn and it was as haven on red&agreed bell pepper. Pick , sour cream & gauc = excellent!"}
{"text":"Service stinks. Wings are good. When we have dined in, the service is usually slow. Today I tried to call in a to go order, was asked for a credit card number. I have ordered to go before and never asked for a card. I was driving there and I let the server know I was driving and on my way, she huffed. When I arrived I knew she never put in the order because of the wait for my order. Defeats the point of calling it in."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to watch the Suns game on Saturday night.  First impression was pretty good.  Large number of TVs, good selection of draft beers and the waitress was friendly.  Once we ordered our food things went downhill.  The nachos were truly awful.  Very low quality ingredients and huge balls of raw, unmelted cheese made them unpleasant top look at and even worse to try to eat.  When we called the waitress over to send them back she reacted as if we spit in her face.  She took them away abruptly without a word and never returned to our table again.  We finally asked for a check and went somewhere else to eat and watch the game.  We weren't mad and would have stayed and tried something else on the menu.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food because the wings were awesome and they have a decent selection of brews  on tap. Anyone who's been to Tucson and know Wings over Broadway would agree that it's hard to find anything that can compare but I think Cogburns is close.   1 star for service. I hate to outright bash service but the girls here were dumb as rocks and had no personality. It was really disappointing. Seems to be the trend..... Good food, bad service  I have to imagine as a newer place the service will get better so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Real chicken wings!!?! After eating fitty cent wings that don't taste like chicken these wings this place gives me hope. The wings taste like chicken and they make their own sauces."}
{"text":"I finally reached my last straw with this place. A few weekends ago there was a crowd there that the staff was obviously not happy about sitting at the bar (which is completely normal at ANY bar)! It was midnight.. that means dealing with drunk people. As a business, you are not always going to like your customers or want them to stay there all night, but punishing the customers there that were not apart of that group is downright wrong. Instead of kicking out the trouble makers, they decided to shut the entire bar down early. Sorry, that's just not how you operate a business. Good luck to them trying to run a bar like that."}
{"text":"Myself and some of my co workers went to Cogburns after work to have wings and beer. I work close by and have been to Cogburns on several occasions since it opened with out incident until recently. The bartender was great and provided amazing service. We were enjoying or self's until the drunk owner started making advances towards the females in our group. We advised the bartender and the owner that his advances were not appreciated nor professional. The owner in his intoxicated state became argumentive and belligerent. We quickly left the establishment and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem. The wings are great but the staff is phenomenal. I've been in there on a few different occasions. Once with a brunette bartender late night and just last night with a blonde late night bartender. Never had to wait for a drink. Food came out prompt, fast, correct and tasted great. I've been serving for over ten years and so by the time I get off I just want a nice place to relax and have a drink. This is it"}
{"text":"I love the wings and fries.  Used to go to the one on Queen Creek rd all the time and never had a bad experience.  I was elated when one opened on power in mesa 5 mins from my house.  But, every time I go there the service sucks.  It takes a long time to get the food, wings are almost cold but fries are piping hot.  Waitress comes by to take your order but never see her again until the food comes.   As long as it took for the kitchen I could of had 2 more beers but never saw the waitress. Too busy talking with the other girls at the hostess desk.  The last 2 times I went there I had to go to the hostess to get my check.  I told the hostess today that they could have gotten the sale of a few more beers if someone would have come around.  She acted if she cared, don't think she did.   Next time I'll go back to the other location and see if that has changed and if so may just take my business elsewhere.  Wings and pizza at Barros, never disappoints.   Hmm, notice there are no responses on these reviews by owner or mgr.  guess they don't care."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with the ambiance in the main dining area... Very sparse and you feel cut off from the rest of the place. Should be more open to the bar area where most of the people are and the action is. The food was decent, but pricey. The regular burgers were good... Great buns! But an up charge for cottage cheese??  I don't mind paying $10 for a burger if it's great and the atmosphere is enjoyable... But Not the case here. The cottage cheese was listed as one of the side options, so makes no sense that there was an extra $1 charge! Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but food delivery was slow (kitchen issue, not a service issue). I think they missed the mark in the way the restaurant was laid out. Not sure I'd go back except to be in the bar area and watch sports. Needs a patio too!"}
{"text":"When you walk in it smells like fabuloso and sewer.  The foods is only good if you need a good cleanse."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a bunch of my girlfriends and had a blast!  It's a sports bar that is a ton of fun.  The servers and bartenders are a lot of fun, and we get to know the owner as well.  The owner came put to check on us regularly and is super cool.  The food was amazing too.  The chili is the best I have ever eaten.   The drink pours were very generous and the bill didn't kill us at the end of the night (that's always a relief and will keep us coming back).  Give cogburns a try, you'll have fun!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful Monday. Hockey on the screen and cheeseburger in my belly. If you happen to be here when Courtney is behind the bar then you're in for great service and an awesome smile."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Really in the mood for a good burger! Sorely disappointed. Bland and soy-burger-tasting at best. Co worker got a chicken wrap. He said it tasted cafeteria style.   After we ordered, 40 minutes passed and finally had to ask her to bag it to go. More waiting.We only get an hour for lunch. We only saw one server until we got ready to go. Not sure where 2nd server had been. Took another 5 minutes to settle up our tab. In addition to the slow service, bad food, and blah attitude, we were late getting back from lunch, and we work extremely close! Won't venture here again. Btw.. Got back to office-took 2 bites of burger and threw rest away!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend, the kids and I went here for lunch today.  The food wasn't anything significant to write home about, but wasn't bad, however not worth the prices they charge.  Where this location really has its problem is with its service.  The only thing they were really attentive on was refilling our drinks (2 sodas and 3 waters).  All of our food came out sporadically and at the same time.  We ordered both appetizers and lunches.  The food basically came to the table in one rush rather than the appetizers coming out first and then the meals as is commonplace in most restaurants.  They also charge for every little thing.  Want a side of BBQ sauce because the sliders are too dry, an extra ranch, etc. And you're looking at 50 cents a pop.  Going forward, I won't be coming back to this location.  I can get better service and prices for much better food at Flipside, Native Wings and things, The Reef, Zipps and other places in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since we LOVE wings! We'd been meaning to try it for sometime!  Nothing really special about Cogburn's. There are plenty of tv's, but the size of most of them are on the small size. Service is OK. Our server was pleasant, but a little forgetful and could be a bit more attentive to her customers. She didn't seem to knowledgeable on the current menu.  Ordered their wings, which is advertised & are supposedly known for. Latest is the  \" have to have\" PB & J flavor. We passed on that! Did do the Raspberry Chipotle \" which was way to sweet \"..The \"5 flavor\" was our favorite fried , then grilled and sauced perfectly. BTW; NOTE- to have them grilled is NO additional fee! Highly Recommend!   Had included in our meals the Tuesday Night special - French Dip. Unfortunately, it was Bland! Had to ask for sauces to add to the actual dip! Not a lot of meat; but for $7 it was a fairly reasonable meal which included fries.. Hubby had the sliders and he said they were \"okay\"!   Additional Info: They also do poker night on Tuesday. The food is affordably priced and is good depending on what you order. We missed Happy Hour - However, they seem to have some good deals. All is listed on their menu for each day they have specials. Thursday's are .65 cent wings."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great customer service! We are making this our go to place in the South East Valley. We have so far tried the wings, burgers and they taste great! The owner is present and friendly, try this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service i have seen.  I would rate a 0 if possible. Walked in and a girl was writing on the sign up front she was the only one that said hello.  My wife and daughter proceeded in and no one greeted us asked us if we needed a child seat or even a menu for that matter. I went and got the child seat myself as i passed the 4 girls up front collecting it no one said a word. We then proceeded to sit there for over 5 minutes while at least 6 different employees passed our table none of which offered to help us.  I wish i could rate the food but if the service is that poor im sure the food is equally bad. I am happy that this will definitely help out the sushi place next door as thats where my family and i elected to go due to the horrendous lack of service we recieved, as im sure many others will do as well. Another note upon leaving the same girl was outside and said for us to have a good evening to which i responded your service is horrendous and she said nothing. Epic fail on customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent wing good drink specials waitress and bar tenders awesome, but hostesses are to dumb to understand English and are rude s all hell. Owner should have a talk with them and put them in check."}
{"text":"Place blows. Service is horrible. We get menus dropped off and no one comes back to take our order. Last trip i had to go to bar to get a drink while 6 waitresses wondered around..STRIKE 2 I'm out."}
{"text":"1st time, I got to say from walk-in atmosphere is great! I ordered a margarita, not that great :( however the other bartender brought me a new margarita on the house, which She advised me that she remade the drink. She Had me retry the drink and wanted to make sure it was to my standards. It was delicious! What great Customer service that was! The owner was beyond amazing, great customer service and just very humble and down to earth. This is definitely our new spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Sports bar in this area! The food is delicious and the service is excellent! This will definitely be a place we go to a lot! They have lots of huge screen TV's for the games and the best wings by far! The portions are huge and the beers are ice cold! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Live close by and we come here at least once a week. Good atmosphere. Good music. Good food. Southwest chicken wrap, salads, and wings are good. Cold beer and good bloody mary's. Love Thursdays the best. For the most part the bartenders and wait staff cater to the male customers and a select couple are downright disrespectful to females. Nice patio, but could use better service out there."}
{"text":"I like this place allot, great view of the screens for sports and if the bar is full just go to the upper deck seating and you are still part of the fun. Real reasonable prices and the staff is great. This is the power and Ray location and we NEEDED a bar like this in this area. They also have a great family section that is split away from the main bar so you can bring your family. The waitresses are all cute, fit and wear their traditional daisy dukes shorts but not too overboard so it is still kid friendly and classy. Not like a hooters. Have fun I enjoy this place, hope it helps."}
{"text":"This is a great place for wings. Its a great place to watch a game. The servers are always friendly. If I go to a sports bar, I wanna see and hear sports. I don't wanna hear country music all the time. Its been awhile since I've heard their awesome sound system during a big game. I'm not a big UFC guy, but I love traditional sports. This place is fun, but has potential for even more."}
{"text":"It was our first time there and the service went above and beyond! Our experience, however, sucked.   My fiance and I walked in on a busy Friday night. The manager (brunette, didn't get a name) made room for us up at the bar top by scooting over chairs. I sat next to a nice gentleman who didn't mind the close quarters, but the fellow my fiance had as a neighbor was, in lack of better terms, an asshole! The fellow came back from a smoke break to find us sitting at the bar and by his body language did not care one bit for it. He was practically sitting on my fiance! Every time I scooted to the left (and asked the others to move too), my fiance moved and so did the asshole. Any closer, I would have asked what he wanted for Christmas! Whatever, he won. We got the clue.   So we moved from the bar to the patio. It was so cold for an Arizona night. The wind was blowing so it didn't help. The waitress (Devonie) took our drink and food order out there, and when she came back, we wanted to move... AGAIN!  I felt so bad for our fickleness. But I did not feel any annoyance from the server.   As we left, a witness from the bar spoke up and said \"Yeah, that guy was a dick.\" ha. Well, at lease we weren't the only ones.   Great service! Stupid asshole."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, not so sure it's for kids, waitresses are dressed in a fun way but again prob not best for kids. Wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"Morgan the bartender made the whole time there even better. Good was great and atmosphere was really cool. Only real reason I would come back is Morgan though."}
{"text":"5 star service !! Ryan the owner is amazing . Great customer service , food and a wonderful atmosphere . Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"I went to Cogburns because my friend recommend it. The place was previously called Paytons place. Its newly remodeled, its appearance has improved. However the staff could use a little improvement in friendliness I walked pass 2 waitresses on my way to the bar and did not receive so much as a smile or a hello. My friend and I sat at the bar for a good 10 minutes before the female bartender took our drink order and they were not busy. We would later order some food which consisted of hot wings and a quesadilla. The food arrive rather quickly which puzzled me since my quesdilla was burned and black under neath. Some of the hot wings were also burnt. Food was mediocre, I dont really expect much from bar food except the food is fresh and not over cooked. Honestly the hot wings at Native New Yorker are better. Honestly I would not recommend this restaurant and probally will not return. Theres other bars with better food and value."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty wings. This is a local spot that has a comfortable bar with excellent staff. Wings were flavorful with Raspberry Chipotle sauce and Philly Cheese was delicious and not messy, which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"The wings and pizza are amazing. Wish we could've tipped the cooks instead of server. \"Lean\" was our server, not good service. Our drinks were empty for a long time, she didn't come by to check on us often. On my way to the bathroom all of the female servers were sitting at a table eating when they could be checking on tables.. Also bathroom has major leak, very gross. We had to get up and ask for things several times. Been to this location 4 times and service has not changed."}
{"text":"Went to Cogburns last night for wings and I would say they have improved from our initial visit.  Garlic Parmesan wings are our favorite.  They seemed to be relatively busy but no wait (it was a Thursday night).  My only complaint would be it is a little loud with the TV volume competing with the music volume. :)"}
{"text":"Service is horrible and we were he only customers in the restaurant. Wings were average at best. Honey hot are not sweet or spicy, just salty. Don't order the house salad with balsamic dressing. It is not a $7 salad! The balsamic dressing is a weird sour cream/yogurt base. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Initially confused this review with no where near as good or friendly Whiskey Row.   My bad.  This place was fantastic, zero complaints, people were great and will return for sure."}
{"text":"This place so awesome and the service is outstanding.  I love this place Morgan and Coutney is sooo nice and out of there way to show us a good time. Mesa location on power and ray"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times I had a great experience.  Different bartender and wait staff on duty each time, and I can't say a thing bad about them. I did hear the one bartender talking about over bearing customers, and saw one myself. Maybe that is why some people are giving this place a bad review. As for me, I have found a nice bar to go to when I want to kick back and relax."}
{"text":"2nd time here in a row for the UFC fights. Sitting on the patio with 3 girls working, and not a single one asks if they can get me a drink in almost 2 hours. I'm use to a $100 bar bill when I go watch the fights, but now I just drink before I come and don't have to worry about them taking any of my money."}
{"text":"Bartender was very nice and attentive. Great atmosphere to go and watch a game and have a good drink and not badly priced"}
{"text":"The new location of Cogburns is already in need of help. The service is awful. The place is not busy and yet the service stinks. Lots of staff just standing around and talking and they all look so lost"}
{"text":"the thing about this place is that it could be that local bar you love but the attitudes from the staff are peculiar.  At best they are annoying.  They never know the specials, the dont know how to create a fun experience.  The food is good but over-priced.  I'd drive a little further and be satisfied than spend more money at this place.  SKIP IT!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome so we have returned here several times to give this place chance after chance to improve the service that deserves 1 star on their best impression. Unfortunately, I think after leaving today to go to another nearby chain wing place due to poor service, will have to value my time and skip a return. May order takeout but not going to devalue my time and dine in...."}
{"text":"Food was consistently over cooked or over soggy. The seating left a lot of people running around trying to poach chairs from other tables all night long. Get there early or stand all night. Only plus side was multiple TVs even though they refuse to put hockey on any of them. I suggest Buffalo Wild Wings over this place every day and especially if u need to watch a hockey game."}
{"text":"Terrible service, horrible prices for the type of food. Ghost town and once we were served, I can understand why."}
{"text":"We were greeted twice before selecting our seat in front of the big screen. Meagan (bartender) is the BEST. Menu is great. I tried a new burger (Southwest) while hubby had his usual ham & cheese."}
{"text":"Great wings.  Great atmosphere. Lots of tv's for games and tons of seating. Will be back to watch the Broncos games!"}
{"text":"I gave this place four stars because, for a sports bar it is a higher standard than many I've been in. I really liked the seating choices for watching sports.  They had three banks of TVs set up in different \"rooms\" and most of the seating allowed for easy viewing.  We sat upstairs and faced the TVs at a nice little loft style area.  The food was normal bar fare, nothing extraordinary, but a decent value.  The wait staff was very friendly and kept up in my order.  I would definitely come here to watch games as my local sports bar."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because there isn't much around...but the service here is just lame."}
{"text":"The Nachos are Terrible.   More Soggy Chips in chili.  The frys are good; started the night drinking out of a Paper too Go cup... had to ask for a real one.  Weak sauce overall.  But they do have the Fight"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some lunch time wings, first time here. Service was excellent,  wings even better. The beer was cold and there was lots of sports on the many Tv's. The menu looks good, so I'll have to come back and try it out. Told they show MMA events. Set back in the shopping center, behind Jack-In-The-Box."}
{"text":"I have a buddy that had been talking this placed up big time, so one Friday night I decided to mosey on down there with a buddy for some chow and a cold one. While you drive by, if you blink you will miss it. After finding it and walking in I was confused... You see, you walk in and see a custom 3 floor dining area and no bar.... I had to look around to try to find the bar since the layout is confusing. The bar was slammed so we wandered around, since there was a sign saying it was not open seating... We tried to find someone and after a few minutes we were told we could just sin anywhere on the 3rd floor. We found some seats and almost instantly began sweating. The upstairs and pretty much the whole location was just miserable hot.   After about 10 min the waitress came and got our drink order, she at that time apologized for the wait and told us someone called in so It was literally just her in the area. We told her it was ok, and tried not to get frustrated when our drinks took another 10 min to come out, and the round of shots were ordered were wrong. After we got our drinks I asked her why it was so hot in that place. She explained AC went on restaurant kitchen and the  cooks opened the doors to the main area to get some cool ac blown back there... I feel like their theory was wrong because all the heat came back into the main area. So I  placed my food order  next which was a burger and onion rings, that, I shouldn't have ordered... I finally got my food about 30 min later and 2 minutes before just walking out and giving up. Im not glad I stayed. The burger was dry, burnt and falling apart from how dry It was. At this point the poor waitress was running around I wasn't going to worry about how bad it was.  We left right after we ate the food. It was honestly one of the worst overall experiences ever... Skip this place... Save your money and try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Best customer service and the vibe in the restaurant is awesome! Good music, food and beer"}
{"text":"Came here with friends to try the wings.  If what you are looking for is a sports bar with decent food - good selection of beer - and the game, then this is the place.  Not a fancy place by any means.  We all ordered the wings and they were pretty meaty which is what the place is known for.    My lack of a full five star was for the service.  Waitress was friendly but the food took a long time which was surprising because for a sat night, it wasn't super busy.  Also had to hunt her down on refills :/       I hear the burgers are good, so will give those a try next time."}
{"text":"The service sucked. We had to order a lot if things twice,  they screwed up my kid's order them said they didn't have what she ordered. The waitress blamed the kitchen and the bar but I don't care who's to blame, an empty table is an empty table.  We all had wings so I can't speak to the food too much. They were well cooked. It's cool that they have so many flavors but they ended up tasting pretty similar. Too sweet, not enough heat. I will say that the pb&j wings were a hit with the girls. This location is not as good as the Val Vista location by a long shot."}
{"text":"We came here because we heard the wing's were really good. I don't think I agree.   We asked what was the most popular and ordered that. The honey hot were just ok, somewhat flavorful but not great. The garlic parm were better. The medium were mild at best,  we got a side of hot and that was better. On the bright side,  the fries were very good.  Overall I think there are better places if you want wings."}
{"text":"I understand that this place just opened but we had terrible service. We sat at the bar and the bartender was rude and did not care much about serving us. We left after 1 drink, so we didn't get to try the wings."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here you have to go the wings are great, our server Tiana was busy but still made us feel important."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Seemingly good deals on the daily specials, but not so fast. Monday was 1/2 pound burger and fries, but the burger did not look like a 1/2 pound, maybe somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 pound, but no way were they 1/2 lb ! Toasted buns, which were nice, but not very impressive looking considering it's touted as a $12 burger (normal cheeseburger price if it wasn't a Monday.) fries were fantastic, nice generous amount of fries, not too beefy, not too scrawny, just right amount of soft middle with crunchy edges (my kind of perfect.) Aside from the unimpressive looks and the less-than-half pounder, I would have given them a 4+ rating, but my friend and I both had gas afterwards and worse, even an upset stomach, so I wonder how fresh the fare is. The place was near empty and we wrote it off to it being a Monday night with no big-deal game to draw out a bigger crowd, but after the upset stomach, maybe they just don't get enough burger business. The specials for the rest of the week looked interesting, but just not sure we'll venture back any time soon. Will see how adventurous we feel about risking another stomach upset. We like the place. the location and the staff, just hope they get enough business to keep the fare fresher."}
