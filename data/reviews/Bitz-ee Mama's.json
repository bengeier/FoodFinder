{"text":"This place has pretty decent tamales for 3 bucks... I purchased the tamale outside of the restaurant while attending Glendale Glitters. I have not been inside or tried anything other than their tamales but I would buy some again."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to creations which is next door but ran into this one and decided to try it. I had the bit zee red chili skillet with a short stack and my company have biscuits and gravy with bacon and scrambled eggs. My skillet was good for something that was simple, definitely filling. I had craved pancakes and tried their pancakes despite the fact I don't like pancakes that much. They were ok but soothed my sweet craving. My company said their sausage gravy is amazing and the bacon was cooked perfect. I, however, don't eat pork products so I couldn't tell you myself how it tasted. I was bummed out that they ran out of apple juice, that was my go to breakfast drink. The other people that were at the establishment had been very loud, obnoxiously loud. Our waiter was very impersonal and seemed like she didn't like her shift. She didn't send off friendly vibes but food was great."}
{"text":"The waitress was rude, and their French toast sucked! Before I left, I put the tip money back in my pocket."}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing the Ad on the Glendale Star's web site. The offer of 1 dollar margarita's is False. We stopped in on Thursday and asked for the 1 dollar special margarita as posted on the ad, but were informed that is only on Monday's. I questioned the waitress about the Ad, but to no avail she said no. I question the Ad polices of the local paper for not checking if the customers Ad's are false. Never going back to a business that false advertises."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were underwhelming. Chips - not made in house - were cold and flavorless. The salsa was ok but also lacked flavor and and was too small a portion. 

We ordered green burritos enchilada style. The tortillas were thick and tasteless  and the filling was lukewarm and also lacking. The plate was hot se we suspect they simply stuck it in the microwave.

The only positives of our meal were the red enchilada sauce was tasty as was the margarita."}
{"text":"This was not good. The scene here was scary at best. 

I got fajitas. How do you mess up fajitas? Mama did it.

My dining partner wasn't all that hungry and sort of sick. She got a grilled cheese. How do you mess up grilled cheese? Mama did it.

It's too bad, because downtown Glendale could be cute.

I *wanted* to like it.

Bad. End of story.

Update 9/13/08
I probably shouldn't admit this, but we have taken to calling it \"Barfy Momma's\" around our house. Yes, we are bad."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food, worst service, even worse margarita. Never ever going back, they serve the locals better than any body else. 
If you want super good Mexican food and really super service try PEDROS up the street."}
{"text":"Bitzee mama's has been a family favorite restaurant for as long as I can remember. Their breakfast is where it's at. Large servings, friendly and attentive staff and inexpensive. They are always very accommodating to large groups. Their staff is very involved in the community and it makes for good business."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. The service was terrible, we were told it would be 15 minutes before we could be sat and there were 6 tables open. After we sat they took our order and after 40 minutes it came to the table slightly warm. The food was bland and I could have done better at home. I would go to Denny's over this. The  seats are uncomfortable and need repair and the loud music was a bit much. I couldn't enjoy a nice breakfast in some quiet."}
{"text":"It was the WORST food I ever had. The so called green chili burro NASTY. It was some kind of green sauce with cracked black pepper. It was. Just plain gross. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. It is an insult to Mexican food."}
{"text":"For a dining experience you won't soon forget, I can't recommend Bitzee Mama more highly.  Unfortunately, you'll remember it for all the wrong reasons.  
Where to begin.  First off we showed up on Monday night for dinner.  Closed.  OK, so I checked their website which says they're only open until 2 on Monday, then Tue - Sat until 9.  Showed up Tues at 6 for dinner.  Closed again!  So on Wed I called & found out that they're open Thu-Sat until 9.  I suggested they update their website and got a grunt as a response.  If I hadn't had a LivingSocial I would have written this place off but the $10 was non-refundable so I figured 'it can't be any worse than making a \"run for the border\".  
I ordered the green chili beef chimi and my GF ordered two shredded beef tacos.  I have to way that the incredibly small amount of meat was a pretty tasty morsel, but that's all it was - a morsel at each end with a small green chili in the middle.  And how do you screw up refried beans?  I can't even begin to identify whatever it was I was tasting.  Rancid fat?  Even tho my GF ordered the tacos ala carte she got the dinner which included more of the rancid fat refried beans and rice that they had somehow managed to infuse with a sickly pinkish-orange color.  
In short, even tho I got the whole thing for half price I still felt ripped off."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Bitz-ee Mama's! The breakfast is pretty great! The chicken fried steak is really good. No grizzly pieces-believe me-I am always the person to find a nasty piece of meat, and I did not find one bad piece. The staff is super friendly, and the prices are good. Parking is easy to find, which is also a definite plus! I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. After waiting for almost an hour for food in a restaurant that wasnt that busy, breakfast was inedible. The pancakes were burned, the bacon like charcoal, and my husband took maybe 2 bites of his bitzee skillet. How hard is it to make breakfast? After waiting that long it should have been perfect or at least edible. Blech. Run in the other direction people. Oh and the bathroom plunger with dried toilet paper all over it was a nice touch in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Wow, a whole list of less than stellar reviews and then two 4-5 stars in one day! By new reviewers even! That haven't reviewed another thing! WOW! What ever could have happened at Mama's to make not one but TWO brand new reviewers feel SO strongly about the quality of their experience there that they would bother to log on and  write a review? 

I truly want to like Bitzee Mama's. Really I do. So much so that I went back twice more. I know I can be bitchy occassionally so I try to give places more than one shot w/me. The food was average at best but the service just sucked. There were only about 4-5 tables occupied in the whole damn place but yet service was so bad that the customers, myself included, just started getting up and getting what we needed- refills, napkins, whatever. The one waitress, well, I'm not sure if she is truly just slow in the noggin, on drugs or crazy. I could go on but I think you get the picture. I  hope these other \"4-5 star reviewers\" had that good of an experience there and not just an extra 15 minute break as an incentive."}
{"text":"I am rating this place one star...I am being generous, actually super generous...shame there is not a negative star rating system.

I went here one night with a group of family and friends, nothing extreme, just 6 of us.  The restaurant was about 1/4 full and they had live music.  Was not my choice to come here, we actually came on this evening bc my friend said that she heard the singer was good.  

It took about 20 minutes before we were greated by our server and another 8 minutes to actually get our drinks.  Then our server flat out disappeared.  Finally remembering that she only makes money if she talks to the table, our server reappeared and took our food order.  35 minutes later our \"food\" came out.  We all took a minute to stare at our plates to figure out what exactly was on them.  I have had more identifiable food served to me in a school cafeteria.  The food tasted even worse than it looked and at this point (of course our server never came to see how things were) we were all pretty put out about the whole place.

Then the singing act (on break from her Motel 8 on the side of the freeway lounge act) came over to see how we liked the show and the food.  We told her exactly what we thought of the food and the service and the singer went BALLISTIC, I mean you would think that we just ran over her dog the way she reacted.  Completely irritated and annoyed we wanted out of this place.  Sadly it was another 15 minutes before our server reappeared and we asked her the very complicated request of getting our check.

Finally making our way to pay the cashier person asked how things were and we told her it was the most disappointing and aggravating experience we had ever had dining out...her reply \"Everybody loves us, and we have amazing food, I don't know what you are talking about!\" And scoffed off to go do something else.  Really lady? Really? Maybe you should check out the other reviews on here... seems like your fan club isn't as big as you thought.....

Just thinking about this place to write this review gets my pulse racing.  Never Never Again!"}
{"text":"Wow, reading the other review, guess waiting for your food to be served can be an issue at this restaurant.  Try waiting an hour and 1/2.  Other diners were so perturbed they left in frustration; the intrepid restaurant staff then offered the departed diners plates to those still waiting for food - TACKY.  

By the time our food was served, my mother in-laws hot beef was COLD.  They supposedly were short 2 cooks. Since they had a large group of women and a Red Hat society that seemed to get their food in good timing, maybe the cooks walked out mid-shift.  My husband wouldn't let me make a stink, but after a wait that long, with a hot dish being served cold, there should have been an offer at comping a meal or taking a certain percentage off.  How on earth does this place survive?

Salsa was good, shredded beef chimi I had was below average and over-fried.  At least I know now if ever antiquing in Glendale again I can avoid this restaurant!

So far the downtown Glendale restaurants I have tried have been sub-par and not worth trying again (Kimberly Ann's Tea Shop was the other)."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem!!  Lulu and Kristine are the best!  It's hard to find good Mexican food and this place is a favorite of mine.  Cheese enchiladas are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Awful!  I was there 4 or 5 years ago and thought it was good, but today was awful.  My dining partner couldn't even eat her taco salad.  When we asked for a PARTIAL refund we were told no since she ate some of it...How do you know if you don't like it if you don't eat it?  Salad was wilted and the beef was way too salty.  After we complained service pretty much stopped after we complained.  We had to ask for more water but you could tell they were a little put out by our request.  I am very disappointed for I liked this place and it has some charm.  Not sure what is going on but it sure has changed.  Also noticed not as many customers as before."}
{"text":"Ick. enough said. There are too many better options in the area. I would advise you to use them."}
{"text":"A very busy place we came in one server for like 2 big tables and 4 smaller tables. Got Our Drinks fast though.  Food was good I got the steak and eggs but the steak was very thin and I like mine mooing and it was cooked all the way which is easy to do since the steak was thin.  Getting refills took awhile. Finally more servers came on but service was just decent afterwards.  Pancakes was amazingly good. Overall I do like the place alot and our server was nice."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service! We wanted to support a local restaurant while visiting Glendale Chocolate Fair across the street. We were seated immediately, but waited over 15 minutes to have someone take our order.! Asked for someone to take our order but after repeated delays and being ignored, we walked out.  Note to owner, if you are going to survive in this competitive business, hire more help & improve your customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Waited 5 minutes just to be seated and there was plenty of seats available. The staff stood around instead of helping. When seated we were forgotten about for 25 minutes while the waitress was on the other side of the room drinking a soda, checked her phone and texted, then proceeded to complain about another employees performance to another co worker who was sitting down eating. When finally was able to place our order nearly seconds before I was going to just leave the complaining waitress was pleasant to us. Food came quickly. Tamales had barely no filling mostly masa and sauce. Waitress asked if i wanted some of their famous hot sauce I said yes. Well lets just say the waitress went back to complaining and I never recieved that sauce. I've had better Mexican food in Alaska and that says a lot considering I'm in Phoenix! Probably will not return and was disappointed."}
{"text":"Easily the worst food I've have had the displeasure of tasting in a very long time. The dining room is old, well used, and out dated. Margarita was lacking in every way. Spend the remaining of the night throwing up!!! Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Great service on a busy day. It sits right across from the town square so I'm glad they decided to stay open during closed hours to service the Chocolate Affaire.

No alcohol on the premesis it seems but that doesn't bother me.
The initial chips and salsa are delicious but not for those looking for more Caliente.

Fast service and friendly people."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service was great and fast. Had lunch and chose the lunch special. 3 beef tacos were flavorful, perfect generous amount. Food came out piping hot and within 10 minutes. Chips were crispy and salsa had awesome flavor. Love this place! Lots of history here."}
{"text":"Dated.  Greasy.  Poor/rude service.  Taco salad soaking in grease is not good, and when you say something the response shouldn't be well you ordered it.  Too bad it has been a west valley staple but something bad has happen."}
{"text":"Ok I had a tamale at the annual Glendale Jazz Blues Fest, I did not actually go inside the place. But the red chili tamale I had was bland and dry with shredded beef brisket at both ends but none in the middle!  Where was the red chili? They offered no salsa with their tamales either and sold no drinks outside their business. The set up nor the tamale did nothing for their image."}
{"text":"We stopped in Bitz-ee Mama's this afternoon for a late lunch,and were once again reminded why it remains our favorite place to be in downtown Glendale. It's a local, family-owned establishment with great food and a cozy atmosphere in the middle of the historic district. 

If you are into \"edgy,\" \"upscale,\" and \"cutting edge,\" -- please stay away. You wouldn't understand why this little jewel is so loved."}
{"text":"Have been going to Bitz-ee Mama's for years. Only for breakfast, but now will be back again. Posole is my fav the portion was enormous! Will probably ask for additional fixings next time."}
{"text":"The service it's awesome and the good is great. My wife come here every couple of weeks. Locally own and it is great to support local business when you can."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in downtown Glendale looking for a great restaurant this is spot. Its a place for comfort food and an easy vibe. I have been coming here for years, the owners know I order off menu and don't disappoint with the food. Yes, the tables show some miles, the booths are not where you want to sit the whole day, but its a place where you take the future in laws to show  'you get them' and your are not about the offerings of the wine list. (in fact, i'm not even sure they have one) Do yourself a favor and try it once; it's not going anywhere and nor should it be."}
{"text":"A riend took me here for the first time today. Great salsa, when we could get it. The Mexican Pizza was delightful, as well. Chips were okay, I like 'em a little thinner, but that's just me. 

The problem here, as I see it, is the service. Maybe they were just short-handed today, but we had to ask for chips and salsa (the whole reason my friend wanted me to experience the place) to BEGIN with, when there was hardly anyone else there, and when it should have been on the table immediately. Then, we had to ask for more salsa THREE times before we got it. As our dining experience progressed, the place got busier and busier. The staff was actually RUNNING to get everything done. I saw a guy get up and get his own hot sauce at one point. There's nothing like a bunch of people running around like chickens with their heads cut off to make one feel comfortable, you know? 

For a Mexican Pizza to knock your socks off and a MUCH more extensive menu (Bitz-ee Mama's only has like four weird entrees), head to Valle Luna. And if you don't care about decor, etc., walk up to the window at El Norteno and get their pollo fundido, carne asada plate or anything with their crack-in-it red chili. (I don't think it really has crack in it, but that would be one of the reasons it's so addicting.)

I'm a server whose been in the industry all her life. I'm all for giving a place a second chance, but based on the other reviews, it seems I'm right on with this one. Sorry, Bitz-ee Mama's. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"OK OK, Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is, and even they will admit, service sometimes, can be pretty slow. They need more servers! I know it saves them money but I think they lose business because of sometimes how spread thin the waitresses are to like 6 tables. Now me being a local I know that they have that problem but people coming into the restaurant aren't greeted by anyone and sometimes for a minute or two. Pobrecitos, I bet they come in and think well, off to another restaurant. SO enough about the CONS, how about the PROS: The Hot Sauce, is to die for!! I buy that stuff by the jar everytime I come in. It has this great balance between texas and mexican food. I always tend to get the sandwiches or the burgers, and my girl always gets the chimi's or the enchiladas. We can't help but sample each others food obviously and neither of us could find anything that wasn't amazing. So Bitz-ee Keep doing your thing but get some more help! Don't make yourselves look bad to newcomers!"}
{"text":"Worst service everrrr!!!! Claimed to be busy with only about 20 people in the whole  place ... Waited for our food for over an hour, & was cold.. Defiantly wouldn't recommend it for any one & defiantly NOT coming back"}
{"text":"Good food all the time, every time...friendly wait staff....Old down town flavor of Arizona...."}
{"text":"It was recommended to us by a promoter of the music at the Watermelon Festival (thank you Warren!!!). We had 7 people and it was right at lunch time and they still got us in very quickly. Service was a bit slow but to be expected right smack in the middle of the festival. Tamales? AMAZING    and I'm not a fan of tamales unless they're homemade. Bartender was a hoot (Lulu you're the best) as was the waitress. Will definitely be back as often as we can, being as we have a 3 hour drive to get there."}
{"text":"I was not happy with service, food or drink and the bill was too high for what we received. The shredded beef tacos the meat was not cooked, several in my party decided not to eat it. Fish tacos- where's the fish.  Margaritas - did you leave out the alcohol?"}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant after a long morning of family pictures. 

Wasn't very packed but there were 7 of us. The host/waitress seemed very agitated that I wanted to sit down immediately instead of waiting for her to place silverware settings. 

Service was terrible here, I can not believe we had to continuously ask for refills and to even get them to look our way so that we could ask for something was hard enough.  The mother and daughter team here is no longer on point. 

This used to be our go to breakfast place when I lived closer and now since I live further on the west side I stop here whenever we are in the area. 

Food was still delicious so at least their cooks are still doing their jobs but it appeared to me that we really didn't matter in this place and for that, I will make sure none of us return for such lousy service again."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Large portions. Not going to change your life, but a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"My shop is right down the block from Bitzee's and we had to work late a few days last week.  Good thing, cuz I had the chance to try Bitzee's nachos.  They were so awesome, I ended up eating there 3 days in a row & shared the chicken nachos with my hunny each time.  The nachos were smothered in...everything!  Chicken was very flavorful and moist, and the portions were so huge that even though I shared (and I'm not a big fan of sharing) we were both stuffed!

I'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Period.

First visit:  The place was not busy.  Waited to order. Waited for food. Waited for water. Waited for bill.

Second visit: Walked in, waitress looked up then looked back down and completely ignoring us. This did it for us. We will not try again."}
{"text":"This was literally the worst meal I have eaten since I ate at my junior high school cafeteria. The flavors were lacking, the service was horrible. 

I ordered a chicken burrito and it came with nothing but shredded chicken and a tortilla. It was not flavorful. 

The staff didn't know what the food options were when asked. Also, I asked the waitress what was included in the chicken burrito and she said she would ask, she brought me the food without ever asking what was in it. 

Poor food. Poor experience. Save your money. Save the time. Save the calories. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Three stars because these guys aren't even trying to be more than average. Not sure how anyone could rate them higher.

I used to eat here with my family as a child. Literally my whole life. Grandpa was a building contractor and remodelled the interior three times I think... it is a shame to see it looking so bad now.

The others nailed it when they said its a dump. The floors are trashed, the upholstry is a mess and the china is chipped, cracked, and stained.

For me the service was fine, not great but certainly not bad. Food arrived in a timely manner and was hot.

Had the red chili beef burro, taco and tostada. All three were good. The hot sauce was excellent. The salsa looked old and nasty, didnt try it.

Giving he place 3 stars because the food was good. The owner should be ashamed of himself for letting such a historic place go to hell the way they have."}
{"text":"So - I've given this some thought. The food was okay - not spectacular but not awful. The service as well was okay - borderline marginal. The reason for the 1 star review is the waitress took it upon herself to add a 22% tip to my bill. Now, I'll leave a tip - even for marginal service - but I don't appreciate being dictated how much I should leave. A tip is something I give freely - not something the server determines. If the service had been exceptional, I likely would have left a 20% tip - it wasn't so I was going to leave 15%. Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Glendale the other day for business and we decided to walk over to Bitzee Mama's for a quick lunch.  Well, it was anything but quick.  They really weren't that busy, and we waited 10 minutes to be seated, then 15 minutes to put in our order.  Needless to say I was rushed at the end to eat and return to my meeting, gratefully the chairman was with me for lunch.

The menu offers a nice Mexican and American dishes, but I would suggest the Mexican side, come on, that is obviously their thing, specials of Tamales and such, you can go to McDonald's and get a hamburger (without the wait of course).

I ordered the Burrito Enchilada style, which was good and authentic.  Once the food arrived, it was hot and had the typical Sonoran taste that you get in Phoenix.  The food was good and kept this review above 1 star which is where the service was putting it.

They really need to come up with a new culture of customer satisfaction and quick pace to keep their reviews from continuing to decline."}
{"text":"The food is OK. Nothing to write home to mom about. After the server realized that part of my friends order hadn't been served we had to remind once again, while the food was getting cold, to bring the rest of the order. I ordered the country skillet. It was pretty bland. The sausage gravy should be renamed to milk gravy due to the lack of sausage. Another of our party ordered the \"special\", steak and eggs with the steak order rare. His meal was served with well done steak so it was sent back. he received his meal once again but the rest of our party was pretty much finished with their meal. The coffee cups were refilled regularly. Our party of 12 was taken for breakfast without reservation and within the half hour of our phone call. Breakfast pricing was under $10.00. I can't speak for the lunch or dinner menu but breakfast is just OK."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant as part of a civic group annual meeting in the private back room.  The meeting was slated to start at 7:00 PM Friday night.  Bitzee Mama's had all that I desired in a restaurant.  Delivery of my dinner was not delayed, the food was warm, quite good quality and well prepared.  Once I had eaten, my dinner plate was promptly taken away.  Traffic was low.  I can say I had no complaint and would recommend the experience and the establishment."}
{"text":"This place is a no go it's kinda run down seats in booth are torn. It felt like they have no AC it's 100 degrees outside and it's hotter inside than out.  For a Mexican restaurant their menu was plan. The beans were blah tasted like they were a day old. I will say the rice was the only thing good. As for the fish tacos it was bland no flavor who gives tartar sauce on fish tacos. The tartar sauce looked like it was heater up it lost its color it look like a glob  of yellowish looking clumpy oil. I would not recommend this place and think kitchen nightmare show couldn't flip this place. We felt sick after eating there. Think a call to the health department is needed."}
{"text":"Located smack dab in the middle of Old Town Glendale, this restaurant is hidden away for sure. You would need to know that it is here because you do not see it if you drive by. The inside is not fancy and for sure this is a locals haunt. The menu has all of your typical breakfast offerings and the Joe is good too.

Why come here? If you are just looking to get a good breakfast and get out the door without breaking the bank, this is it. The restaurant has a deep family feel and interaction between the staff and regulars is like a family gathering at Thanksgiving. 

The walls are lambasted with art that has been contrived by local artists. Every piece in here is for sale and radiates a feel of the southwest. While here you will experience a diversion into the Latin American culture. If you are in Glendale on business or just for fun, it is a breakfast experience. This is a no frills restaurant, so don't expect the Phoenician if you choose to venture here... Hasta Luego y comes mucha comida...

{"text":"Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama! My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch. She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills. She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright, right? 

Took my real mama there for lunch.. I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile. Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell. She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans. Struck out again with the red chile.. I swear, can no one except La Canasta make red chile? While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted, well wasn't any beef Ive ever had. 

On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then, looks like I ordered the wrong thing! Place is also uber cheap. 

Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine."}
{"text":"This was one of those places that I wanted to like, just for the mere fact that they are sort of a cornerstone of the downtown Glendale scene. I wanted to like this place so much that I didn't write this review based on one visit, nor two, but three strikes you're out!

There isn't much that Bitzee Mama's does well. In fact the only redeeming trait might be the salsa (but even that isn't enough to bring me back of my own fruition). The service is \"OMG - I CAN FEEL MY HAIR GROWING\" slow. The food is nothing memorable - if you even get what you order (once I ordered a cheesesteak and I just got the cheese - I kid you not, no meat). The prices are actually high for what you get - and check your bill because once I was charged $47.38 for a soda and sammie which I actually had to argue about with the manager (I was pretty sure I could take her, but dang that's just not right).

Mama's may have been a staple in the past, but her age is showing and she desperately needs a calgon moment!"}
{"text":"It's a greasy spoon that I've been going to since I was a small child.  Some of the same servers are still working there and I love them, they are on top of their game.  I usually order the skillet with green chile and flour tortillas, absolutely delicious.  It's old and the booths are torn up but I don't care, I love it!"}
{"text":"I was actually very hesitant to try this place mostly because of the yelp reviews.  I didn't think it was bad at all.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  The food was decent.  I did enjoy the salsa.  I ordered cheese enchilada's and they were what I expected them to be.  I'll absolutely go back for a second try!"}
{"text":"So I want to start by saying the food was good.  The service was atrocious.  

Our waitress had a major attitude and was absolutely put out to serve us.  This was perplexing since there was hardly anyone else in the restaurants.  Several times I would thank her to only get nothing in response except a dirty look.

The diet soda I was served tasted awful.  Someone I was with ordered water only to be served soda.  When he mentioned it, the waitress snagged up the soda, threw it away and as she walked away she mumbled \"I heard you say diet pepsi.\"

Once our food was ready some guy who had been sitting with another party and was dressed in regular clothes got up, walked into the kitchen, and came out and served our food.  This took me a little off guard but in the end it was okay because he was great!  Polite and attentive.  

I ordered the pollo fundido burrito.  The green chili sauce had a kick, the tortilla was fresh and the chicken inside had great flavor.  The chicken was juicy, shredded, spiced and overall great.  They used high quality cheese and the beans and rice were good.

They offered two salsas, one chunky and one hot sauce style.  Both were good.  The complimentary chips were tasty.  

I always put food above service when I review a place that is the only reason why they get three stars and not two."}
{"text":"I and many of my friends have ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at Bitze-ee Mama's 
Love the new owners, great customer service - outstanding tamales, green corn, sweet, red - they are all good.

Great fajita salad - live music on the weekends - they make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"I give this pale 2 stars simply because of its location which is very convenient I those who work in downtown Glendale. Run down decor, sweetly unprofessional staff, strange menu that is mismatched and overpriced & poor tasting food. I have been here several times for business lunches and that will be the only reason I ever return."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give it the one star :( I wish I had checked Yelp before I bought my Living Social deal...total waste of money. My boyfriend a native of AZ raved that Bitz-ee Mama's had great Mexican food so I took part in the Living Social deal. We finally got around to going this weekend and what a mistake. We walked in and I was put off by the \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere but I know that most \"dive\" restaurants have good food so I decided to put snobbery aside for the moment. We waited a lenghty amount of time for a table as it is preferred over a booth but were ok with that fact. We were plopped down in the middle of a mixed group of individuals dressed in Halloween costumes participating in Karaoke :( This situation was less than ideal but I was going along trying to be a good sport. The menu had a few mexican selections and a lot of diner type of food and my mood got worse...still trying to be a good sport but knew this wasn't going to end well. Our waitress rolled around several minutes later with chips and salsa and took our drink order. The salsa was visually un-appealing and I couldn't force myself to try it but my boyfriend said it was great....it should be noted that he will eat most anything :/ About 8 minutes later no drinks and he said let's bail. The waitress walked past us several times clearing other tables and we were right next to the bar so we weren't quite sure what the delay was??? 

Sad to say that this restaurant lacks the charm that we were looking for. Luckily there are a lot of other great local business in the area and we will stick to visting them :)"}
{"text":"When you walk in it's like taking a step back in time, but considering it's in a historic neighborhood were shabby is chic, it's not bad, lol. 

Service was very friendly, booths are small, food was decent. I heard the people in the booth behind me saying their food was great & I was tempted to turn around & ask what they had but my daughter stopped me short & begged me not to embarrass her, threatening to die if I asked. I decided to be nice & keep her alive, so no idea what they had, but I trust that they liked it :) I had a veggie burger with curly fries & my daughter had a BLT sandwich with regular fries. Both were good, no complaints. 

Oh, & they are open on Sundays, which is not true of many restaurants in that area. Another plus!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me tee this up.  I was in the area with my Wife and she wanted to check out the antique shops nearby.  Well, I wanted to watch the football games.  So, while she shopped, I popped in here for a Beer & some food.

I tried the Abondigas Soup and Chips & Salsa.  Both were ok.

There aren't too many TV's in the restaurant, so I got luck that there were only  few tables and I was able to find one with a good view of one of the TV's.

The staff was super friendly and attentive.  They were probably wondering what I was doing since I spent 4+ hrs in there watching football while Wifey was shopping.  LOL

Would like to come back for dinner sometime.  The rest of the menu looked pretty tempting.

{"text":"This is a wonderful family place that has great food.  We were a party of ten last night that got excellent service and LuLu (one of the owners)came and wished Carol a Happy Birthday!  I had the Chili Reano and it was yummy and their house Margaritas are the best!!  I give them 10 stars!! Love you guys!!"}
{"text":"Ok 2nd time here I the last 3 months. 
First time was ok, food was ok also. Played it safe, eggs, bacon breakfast. Folks were good also. Came with regulars who come every week.

Today, OMG! Waited 45 minutes to get served by the Head waitress. We didn't come with regulars this time. She took our order and 10 minutes later 9 firemen came in and 3 waitress, including ours just went that direction. There was only about 35% capacity with over 5 waitress onsite. Two other regulars came in and were greeted by name and served before us, including firefighters. I get the whole firefighter thing but not even fill our water cups. We came at 8:00am. 
The food? Wow, I ordered some menudo and had literally 4 pieces of tripe in my bowl. 2 others at my table the same. Corn tortillas weren't even thoroughly heated. Hard! Potatoes tasted totally from a bag and no joke the biscuits and gravy were cold. 
We didn't say a word! Left most of it and left within 10 Minutes of our food being served. The lead waitress never came back to our table. She was totally serving THE REGULARS. That's look,  know that I will never become a Regular, not ever!
I normally say nothing so that nothing wired happens to my food before it gets to My table. I am a 20% tipper, even if my waitress might be having a bad day, which I normally take into consideration truly. I ha e never worked in the food serving industry and I can imagine the tough customers that come through. I'm not one of those customers, even when my server is tough.... I tend to side with the server. 
But this was epic failure all around! The look in the servers face was almost like, \"sorry, your a new customer!\" Not important! 
Epic Failure! So if your a regular? Glad you are Grandfathered in, or if your in uniform.  Two thumbs up to you! BUT if you are New? Well........ I would TRULY THINK TWICE! Never again!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food with some American options.  Service was good, food was delicious...nice, fresh and hot.  Bathrooms had a lot to be desired, they were a mess, but then we were there during Glendale Glitters so that may have been the reason, although they were limited to customer use only.  When the place is full, they really should clean up the bathrooms more often."}
{"text":"the hubs and I went here this past Sunday for breakfast. 

Our waiter was realllllllly slow, like we sat down and sat and sat for a good 10 minutes when a lady walked by and asked if anyone had taken our drink order, we said no she asked what we wanted. When she came back she gave us the drinks and said she wasn't our waiter but would go find him. 

He arrived and was nice. Took our order that was it. 

The food came out pretty quick. I had the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits tasted frozen but the gravy was good. The hashbrowns were lacking. 

Hubs got the special which had the most heavenly pancakes ever! Soooo good and so giant! Also I stole one of his sausage links which was very good as well! I will order this next time. 

Also at some point a freaken lounge act started playing! They weren't any where near amazing, BUT they totally made the experience awesome, we totally dug on the live music while eating our breakfast. 

Its not the worst breakfast joint, but not the best. The prices are really cheap, we would go back again."}
{"text":"Terrible. The worst I've ever had. The food was bland, overpriced, my hot meal came out cold."}
{"text":"GREAT OLD TOWN GLENDALE DINER. Don't miss the live music for an awesome VFW-like, all-Formica, orange-vinyl dining experience. All that's missing are the brown-striped plates. This is _real_ Glendale, no corporate paint color standards and standard-issue banded-collar button downs, just old school eats and smiles.

--Live music Sundays 10:30 to 12:30; bossa, blues, honky tonk and diner rock
--teeming with regulars; staff makes you feel like family
--service prompt and courteous. My heart would have exploded from caffeine overdose had I taken them up on all the refill offers.
--this is the essence of non-corporate bliss in a local joint. 
--if you like the Tee Pee, you'll love this place.
--Mexican undertones in fajitas, chorizo skillet and posole
--all American favorites too. Cream of mushroom-based gravy is thick as can be.
--dishes that could look good did look good (I'm giving a pass for my gravy-covered eggs and hash -- it LOOKED gross, but tasted great)
--great Sunday breakfast spot
--right in the middle of antique shop nirvana"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bitzee's my entire life. Great food,  great people!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I can't think of any good reason my family would like this place except that it's in Glendale and that's where most of them live. Maybe also because the waitress' call everyone mija or mijo. That's cute. Siiiiiiiiiiyke!

The food is always just mediocre. If I want mediocre I will go to Denny's and pay less. Or cook at home and have a way better meal. I am not a fan of the Mexican breakfast anyway. I can make just as good if not better chorizo and eggs at home. The menudo is meh... The everything else is just meh... I don't know what to say besides meh...

Eat here at your own risk. I don't think you will get sick or anything... but I don't like spending my hard earned dollahs on crap. 

Don't know about you..."}
{"text":"Good decent food. Eclectic old town Glendale restaurant."}
{"text":"Total Dive! Slow service, crappy food and DIRTY."}
{"text":"Our nine person group stopped in while experiencing the \"Glendale Glitters\" celebration for dinner.  We tried to call ahead and make reservations but they informed me that they did not take reservations.   I have eaten here from the 1980's forward to today, so I was familiar with the menu and layout.  It wasn't very busy and the hostess got us right in and let us pick out where we all wanted wanted to sit.
The menu felt abbreviated in relation to what I remembered from years past.  Maybe this was a limited holiday menu? Anyway the food was \"good\" but nothing \"popped\".  I got the feeling the chips came out of a big bag, not warm/hot...the salsa was \"ok\" but a little thin, nothing on the menu that you couldn't find at any generic Mexican style restaurant.... Overall the meal was good and the price was reasonable but I was hoping to show the place off and I was sort of let down.  They did have live music and the guitar player/singer wasn't bad.  Would I return?  Yes, for a quick lunch.  But I really think this place is performing below it's potential."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING. From the atmosphere to the food. Old, run down, holes in chairs, wobbly tables, dirty restrooms... Immediate turn off from the get go. I thought maybe the food would be ok, it was not. I had the two shredded beef taco combo. The shells were store bought, not homemade. The tacos, beans, and rice were soaked from a ridiculous amount of liquid on the plate, I am assuming from the shredded beef. It was less than mediocre food. Here's the kicker - the waitress even screwed up our tab! She did the math completely wrong. She totaled up food, tax, and gratuity (6 or more you get 16% gratuity added) and it was $176!!!! Whaaaat?? The real total was $82. Ugh. Got it fixed and left. This morning I am layingj in bed feeling incredibly sick to my stomach. Started last night... Worse today. Do not eat here!!! Cook at home or go to a better place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food here is normally great but today the service was mediocre at best. Our party was of four and we had already placed our order. Another party of four had sat near us about 15 mins later. They were served their breakfast before us. Our drinks went dry and were never offered a refill. The food wasn't that great also. I only ate half."}
{"text":"My granddaughters and I liked going to Bitz-ee Mama's when we go to Glendale. One time we went the customer service was not good. We just thought they may be having an off night so we decided to give it another try last night. It was not good.  The customer service went down even worse then it was before. They crowded  us all together in the bar area when there were plenty of booths for seating in the dining area. After we were seated we waited another ten minutes before anyone came over.  Ordered water and Margaretta. Didn't get the water and sent over wrong drink. When we got the food my fish was cold. Didn't bring the dressing with my salad.  It took three more times before I got my dressing. I would understand if they were busy, but they were not.  Sorry to say that we will not be going back. The restaurant has really went down hill."}
{"text":"I've dined here since before there was a Yelp! I'm talking waaaay back, like Peabody's-machine way back, when getting your first AOL dial-up connection was a big deal.

I don't think much has really changed...well, except that I have the option of downing a margarita at 11am without any guilt. Something about having a live band at ANY hour brings out the charm in tequila.

My liver was (surprisingly) not up for that, so I focused on strictly food. Something about their lunch menu seemed to fall kinda flat. Their chimis with green chili are pretty good, but nothing you couldn't get better at other restaurants.

With my last visit, I realized that BREAKFAST is what makes this place shine. For a mere $7 I scored a generous chorizo plate with an egg and some refried beans. All with a huge flour tortilla on the side. The first meal of the day goes largely ignored, but with a dive bar atmosphere and solid morning menu, Bitz-ee Mama is something to look forward to on Sundays."}
{"text":"Old rundown, short staffed, odd menu selection, and ever priced, were just some of the issues encountered.  All would have been overlooked if the food was up to par... Needless to say, it wasn't.  I'm Latina so I know good Mexican food, this was NOT it. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place brings back so many memories with my family. It has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down. 

During my recent visit I noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book. I go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit. Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.

The service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event. I don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant. I was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu."}
{"text":"Friendly waitress, blah food. This is a dive joint that needs the awesome food to keep it going of course, I went there for breakfast. Bad coffee"}
{"text":"Bitz-ee Mama's has obviously been around for a long time with minimal attention paid to the condition of the restaurant.  They really need some new chairs and to update the restrooms.  At least there is foamy soap.  For me, that makes everything a little better.  The atmosphere kind of feels like the Mafia Mexicana could be doing their business here after hours, but I'm always open to adventure and think it's cool.  By no means am I implying that it's not safe.  It's just the lighting and decor that made me think this way.

The service was terrible but my friend and I weren't in a hurry, so I didn't let it bother me.  I was absolutely flabbergasted by the massive serving sizes and how inexpensive the menu items are.  The cheap margaritas just call your name and I was tempted to have one at 11am.  Everything I ate was delicious and I literally took home half of my meal because it was so large.  I'd return just for the home-made chips and salsa.  

Bitz-ee Mama's is good for a low key outing."}
{"text":"Pleaze don't eat here food is bland, eggs are scorched, had to ask 4 times for water when thats what was ordered as my drink, try kiss the cook instead."}
{"text":"I'm not usually complainer. Had the worst meal experience in a long time while trying to eat breakfast here. To start off, My family of 4 was ignored while a family of 3 behind us was sat first. They were sat at a 4 top table ( one that would have worked for us too). Not a big deal (more annoying than anything else) except we had to squeeze to the side and let them pass and also had to wait longer for a table with 2 hungry kids. 

Next, we sat for 10 mins before anybody came to our table. Drinks and food were ordered at the same time. Drinks came out about 5 mins later. Food took about 40 mins. Food was cold. All four meals. Both the kids had cold bean burritos. My wife not only had cold soup but it was not the menudo that she ordered. I had a cold hash skillet ( choked down 2 bites). Nothing like cold gravy to top your soggy hash browns and cold meat. 

I would have brought all of this to their attention, but I never saw anybody come to our table again. No server, no food runner, no busser, nobody! All drinks were left empty. All plates were left full. Payed for our \"meal\", left and will never go back."}
{"text":"Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in down town Glendale, hands down. Get the scrambler smothered in green chili. It is so freaking good. The platter is for one but has enough to feed 2 grown men. Definitely feeling."}
{"text":"Nice staff but food was bland(except for the rice) and restaurant felt like it had no a/c..which is okay if you don't live in AZ during the summertime.."}
{"text":"Service was bad. We had to go find the waitress and explain we would need to leave if we could not get any service Finally that was resolved and we stayed. Wish we had left. The drinks was so-so and served on a plastic water cup. The taco shell and tostada shell were pre-formed store bought.  The chicken was fresh and the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh.  We (3 of us) did not get sick and we finished our meal but we most certainly will not return. SO many other much better choices."}
{"text":"So glad I came action this little Mexican restaurant .. Was shopping in the area with a party of 8.. Greeted immediately and served delicious complimentary chips and salsa.. they have a great lunch variety and I noticed on the menu they serve breakfast as well.. we had delicious taco salad, enchilada, tacos and their refried beans and rice were perfect.. Great service and clean environment .. the inside is not fancy but you will love the food ... we will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing to tell my friends about. If your in the area come, but not a place to say, lets go eat at Bitz-ee."}
{"text":"Wasn't busy on this weekday late morning, and I received prompt attention upon entering and my server greeted me within a minute or so.  Chips and salsa were provided and just ok, and I ordered from the lunch special menu which was a little better deal than regular menu items.  Food was average to above average, and my server did a good job checking in with me.

It was a little pricey - just under $10 for a lunch special with soda, plus tip on top of that."}
{"text":"This place wasn't even worth eating there. We came in and they were selling Girl Scout cookies. Wasn't sure I was even in a restaurant and was greeted by the Girl Scout person who did she was taking names to help out and told s it would be fifteen to twenty minutes. How she knew this I don't know. We came back after ten minutes and she tells me they already called my name. When we were finally sat the table was worn  and the seats were wet and the seat scraped me as I tried to get in because the leather was so badly damaged. I couldn't take it and left."}
