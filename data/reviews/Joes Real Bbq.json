{"text":"Wow. This place was a trip.

They are real slow here - if you're late for a flight, you may want to pick another spot. 

Guy in front of me got frustrated that they couldn't follow his simple directions for what he wanted and left. Lady next to me asked if they could put hot BBQ on hers, they said they can't do that. Guy after me came up to complain that they had slathered his order in hot BBQ even though he asked for mild (I thought they can't put hot on anyone's? Apparently you can only get hot if you DONT want it). They put hot BBQ all over mine, even though I didn't ask for hot. Luckily i like spice! Another guy in line left because they were taking too long. 
They were out of ribs and so they just made  me a plate without the ribs I ordered and tried to give it to me like that. Cashier had to send it back to get another type of meat in place of ribs. 

After that comedy of errors I half expected to find a hoof in my meat, but actually overall the meat was excellent, though the workers are not on the ball at all. Very poorly run restaurant, but surprisingly good food.

UPDATE: Gave this place a second chance, same order again.  This time they had their act together, there was a guy behind the counter keeping everyone on-task. It was like going to a normal restaurant!  Much better.  Giving another star now."}
{"text":"Great food. Best BBQ chicken, Great BBQ. Huge baked potatoes. Incredible corn bread. The next root beer."}
{"text":"The sliced beef sandwich I just had was terrible. The meat was tough, Grizzly and full of fat. Joe's isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start, this place is aweful, very unorganized, slow, overly expensive and by the time you get your food it is cold. 

Opportunities for improvement are: 1) when a customer asks for a side of a certain type, in this situation mac and cheese, don't scrape it off the bottom of the pan and put it into a side container. Then when you go to eat your side you find it has a raised bottom and you got cheated.  2) if you are known for your BBQ pulled pork make extra so you don't have to tell your customer at dinner time (7pm) that you are out. 3) when a customer comes to a BBQ restaurant and orders a brisket sandwich ask if they want sauce on it. The customer shouldn't have to beg for sauce on their BBQ sandwich. 4)  After making your customer stand waiting for such a long time do not pull out the micro scale and measure out the exact ounces of their meat selection. 5)  As you are cutting the brisket in front of your customer you shouldn't have to ask if you should trim off the big piece of fat that is on the slices of meat. That should be a given, especially if you are going to put it on a micro scale next. 6) Give the poor guy that cuts the beef brisket a meat fork so he doesn't have to cut it with one hand, while it wobbles all over the place.

I have been to the Gilbert location in the past, what a polar opposite. Wish I could go back in time."}
{"text":"You would normally need to go all the way out to Gilbert to enjoy Joe's.  Now, you have the benefit of enjoying one of the tastiest bbq joints right at the airport, and not pay inflated airport prices (not sure how they pulled that off).  The seating is a bit exposed, but my expectations of ambience wasn't high for the airport too begin with.

The bar seating area has electric outlets for charging your phone.  Definite plus for the airport."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ considering it is in the airport. I loved the coleslaw. It was creamy ans had celery seeds in it. The pulled pork was so good. It has a nice carmelized bark and was so tender. The ribs were ok but they had an overwhelming garlic taste. I loved the hot sauce. They serve that on the side. I will come back next time I am back at phx."}
{"text":"Yep, this definitely scores a 5 stars on the \"AIRPORT FOOD SCALE\".  My review is solely based on eating the baked potato with pork BBQ on top.  The potato was big, hot and tasty ... they put lots of the good toppings on potato but the pork BBQ (also known as pulled pork) made the dish -- it was juicy and tender but most importantly, the pork is clean.  When I say clean, its not swimming in sauce but is just the good old pork meat done nicely.  I did pour the spicy BBQ sauce all over the potato which made it extra tasty but I greatly appreciate I get to choose that, not have it forced on me.  In short, I look forward to being at PHX again to eat this dish."}
{"text":"Not bad for a restaurant at the airport. The original Joes BBQ in Gilbert is far better quality and customer service, but the Sky Harbor location definitely doesn't disappoint. It's one of the best places in the airport to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ pulled pork sandwiches I had in a long time!
Great food, great service, and affordable. Definitely THE place to eat at the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"My goodness. This was by far the best BBQ I've eaten a) at an airport and b) in quite some time (Denver, take note). My husband ordered a plate as I cruised the other restaurant choices but after seeing his brisket, I was sold.

I opted for the 1/2lb meat plate. Started with the cheesy potatoes, which are a bowl of deliciousness. Definitely a little on the spicy side but perfectly cooked potatoes and the sauce is amazing. Meat wise, I went for the chicken (as they were out of turkey) and the brisket. Now I'm not a fatty brisket fan and after seeing my husband's pieces, asked the 'chef' to make mine lean. In my mind this was easily done by removing the fat cap, but the 'chef' carving didn't think so. Consequently about a third of the weight of my 'meat' was left to the side of my plate. But, it was perfectly smoked with a thick red ring around the meat, and beyond tender. The chicken was also the best I've had. Super juicy and I would happily order a full plate of that in the future. My husband also had the hot links and was thoroughly impressed.

I would definitely recommend stopping here for a meal as it's delicious and decently 'airport' priced ($10 for what I got). Lo-Lo's next door sells Kool-Aid and so you're set!!"}
{"text":"It had been 9 hours since my last meal and I was raging hungry after being stuck and delayed on the tarmac from torrential weather on the East Coast. I've always wanted to try Joe's BBQ and to my delight, there was a location right in the airport! I got BBQ chicken with a side of mac n' cheese for only ~$11. I wanted coleslaw too, but they only had a 1/3 scoop left, not enough to constitute a side, but they let me have it on the house! I thought that was so sweet! :) Plus they won't have to throw it away and it'll go to good use, into my tummy instead! 

The chicken looks dry, but it was actually really moist and flavorful. I really loved the sides though! I am a huge lover of mac n' cheese and this one was piping hot, creamy, perfect al dente, and so delicious! The cole slaw was super fresh and crunchy! Totally satisfied my hunger! I had some leftover chicken for lunch the next day and it was still equally delicious! 

Thanks for the hookup! :)"}
{"text":"Airport food, but it's outside the airport so it's supposed to be a little better.

The ribs were dry and really liked to stay on the bone.  Chicken was dry, I needed to have a few bites of my corn to go along with my chicken.  The brisket and pulled pork were a little better.  The bread was hard.

It looked good when they were on the cutting board.  Each time a meat was taken out of the food warmer, it was still steaming."}
{"text":"Very dry brisket, flavorless, Airport location, server was wearing a Lolo's chicken and waffles t shirt so my expectations were pretty low, and yet they still managed to disappoint"}
{"text":"It was hard to give them only 2 stars.  I love the real Joe's Real BBQ but the airport location not so much.  Don't get me wrong the food is still great, if you can get it. The staff is completely incompetent. They have a serious management issue here. The funny thing is the way I understand the deal with airport is the local restaurant open in the airport but they must use  the professional\" management team contracted by the airport.  I just hope this poor performance doesn't reflect poor on the  real Joe's which is still one of best run restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Joe does indeed serve up REAL BBQ here! I have never left this place with out a ear to ear smile and full belly. I love they pecan smoked brisket!!! If Joe offered a smoked pork belly I'd really be in trouble."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Has sausage link tacos and potatoes. Couldn't ask for a better breakfast. Try the hit BBQ sauce with it. They actually took time to prepare my food."}
{"text":"The days of \"airport food\" is long gone, now it's Airport Food!  It's not like you're going to drive to Sky Harbor to have a meal but if you're already on-site, it's definitely not a food desert in The Desert known as Phoenix.

The P and I had to drop my youngest off at the FBO PHX (fancy, huh?) for a flight to Cork, Ireland to study abroad for six months. As I write check after check I'm still struggling to comprehend how I got suckered into this one, but such is the life of an unassuming Father.  I wanted to wait until her flight departed and since it was dinner time, I needed nourishment.  Look no further, even if you're not in the gate section.

I'd eaten at Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert a number of years ago and had a good inkling this would be a decent meal, and it was.  Ordered up the brisket, ¼ lb with sides of mac and cheese and beans.  The meat was excellent, truly great BBQ!  Tender and smoky, complimented with their very hot habanero BBQ sauce.  I love it when they warn you it's hot, and it is! Jalapeño cornbread was also included with the meal. The service was warm, friendly and helpful.

There's plenty of seating in the area to sit back and relax and watch all the travelers scrambling to make their flights.  Not a bad way to spend thirty minutes.
This place is worth trying. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Considering this is an airport location, I'm going to go all cowgirl and give it a generous 4 star.   Half rack of ribs with one side is generously priced at $13.99 which isn't bad for airport or BBQ standard.  Ribs were not that bad.  They fell off the bone but didn't really have a nice bark.  The star is the BBQ sauce which is on the sweet side and oh yummy.  I'm glad I gave this place a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sampler plate for $13 with a side of beans. I thought it was a very good value for the amount of food, and everything tasted really good. The beans were some of the best I've had. The spicy BBQ sauce was actually spicy and good. The service was good as well. I was really impressed and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very good! I thought $10 for a BBQ pull pork sandwich and a nice size salad was great.  They did not skimp on the pulled pork either.  BBQ sauce was good. Other than Chicago dogs at Chicago airport best airport food."}
{"text":"Got the sliced brisket & it's the fattiest piece of brisket I've ever seen. 

Got the beans as a side & they are better than most I've ever had. A mix of several different types of beans in a just right spices flavor. Best of all the beans aren't all mushy like most bbq places. 

However you have bbq for the meat & this place fails on that front."}
{"text":"OK. Now I can only rate Joe's for their breakfast, but, as everyone else has said, it's not what you'd call \"airport food.\" Joe's breakfast was excellent. I mixed it with a lunch item, beans, and wow! Best beans I've had in a while. And I'm a BBQ fanatic. Shockingly enough the service was great as well. Having been in numerous airports around the world, I have seen an incredibly small number of airport restaurants who provide service with a smile along with outstanding food. We only went to the airport for business, but next time we go through Sky Harbor in Phoenix during our travels, we're trying lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This by far is the worst BBQ ever! Dont waste your money! The brisket had so much fat i threw the entire portion away! The pork ribs tasted like they were loaded with liquid smoke! Only good thing was the  cole slaw! on this one!"}
{"text":"When choosing airport food, you usually settle for \"What crappy food do you want to be overcharged for\"... So when I figured I was going to be over charged, I chose to go BBQ and get the most out of it. 

Wow! Amazing food. The price is actually competitive to normal BBQ prices. 

This isn't just a normal BBQ, it's meat is spectacular and has a fall-off-the-bone quality to it. 

On top of all of that, you get funny & friendly employees. 

Choose Joes!"}
{"text":"The BBQ sampler plate was so good! I like the pulled pork and the ribs. The sauce was great. 3/4 pound might be a little too much. The Garden salad was great"}
{"text":"Not bad but if you want this, might as well go to a bbq place not an airport because it's sooooo overpriced. I'm not sure if it's fresh either. But it's either $10 fast food or $17 ribs. Your choice."}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ has a great taste, but a few things are lacking.  First, eating great local BBQ in an airport is awesome.

I ordered the meat plate with hot links, pulled pork, beans and cornbread.  The meats had a great flavor and the links definitely tasted fresh and custom. The pulled pork was a bit overpowered by the sauce (admittedly I said yes to having sauce poured on it).

The BBQ beans were absolutely awesome, don't leave without getting them. Different types of beans, onions, pieces of meat and other tasty bits. A little spicy too.

The plate came with two slices of bread that tasted homemade, but they were a bit stale.  Unfortunately they didn't have spicy sauce and the container for warm (labeled) sauce was not warm.

I also got a slice of cornbread and I was asked if I wanted honey butter and to get it warmed up.  This allowed the butter to melt a little on top.  The cornbread was excellent; crispy on top and moist in the middle."}
{"text":"Hey, its airport food, how good can it be. It wasn't terrible, but the meat was not quite hot and a bit on the tough side."}
{"text":"Solid airport BBQ....Fast & Friendly service....I ordered the Sampler Plate.

The Brisket, Pork Ribs and Pulled Pork were tasty...BUT the Chicken was very dry.
Mild & Hot Sauce was \"ok\" but overall given the location I was happy with the meal."}
{"text":"Joe's is a pretty solid choice for an eatery at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.   The food is consistently high quality and I have always had positive experiences with the employees here.  

The cost is a bit high compared to some other eateries at PHX (though it is far from the most expensive) but this is probably the most unique restaurant in the airport.   

I recommend the stuffed salad with sliced brisket.  Chopped brisket is good here but the sliced is a much better cut."}
{"text":"I was looking at the menu at 7:30 am on Feb 28, 2018.  I observed a server sampling the food to see if it was warm. After tasting the beans she removed the spoon from her mouth and then used the SAME spoon to mix the corn in the serving tray then taste the corn!

I told the server that might be do that at home but it is totally unacceptable to take a spoon out of her mouth and put it back into a serving tray!

Needless to say, I did NOT order anything from this place. 

I also notified the Deposit of Health in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I would rate 4 stars if offsite of airport, but I give it 5 stars because it is the best airport food I have had. Brisket and pulled pork are excellent, tender, juicy, and flavorful. The  pork and beans are outstanding. Very reasonable prices in comparison to how airport food is normally priced."}
{"text":"omg.   i am soooo happy right now.  brisket and smoked turkey hand sliced. great value. i am so mad there is not one in atlanta. for $13. i got a half lb of meat with a side of beans.  yummy."}
{"text":"I wouldn't quite categorize this as BBQ. I should've known better when I could not even smell the food aroma. If you are an avid eater of BBQ save your time and money. If you enjoy eating tasteless food that is unidentifiable when blind folded, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Hmm interesting experience I wanted the bbq sandwich then I decided while she was cutting the meat to switch to the jumbo. She wasn't very happy with me and gave me a lot of attitude another employee then says well it is her job. I was very confused. Decent bbq, bad customer service."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in the whole State of Arizona.  Guarantee it! My favorite place to eat in Phoenix. 
Try the homemade HOT sauce. Makes the meal."}
{"text":"At airport. Need breakfast. Bbq. That's interesting. It was very good. Brisket was very nice. I ordered a 3 meet scramble. I got a 2 meet omelet. The staff had no idea what they were doing. It was odd. But it was yummy."}
{"text":"Terrible. The stuff you buy out of a tub at the grocery store is better. It was edible, but barely"}
{"text":"If your staff says there are refills and the manager doesn't honor it,  something is wrong. Plus he was rude about it. BBQ was also overcooked."}
{"text":"Joe's Real average BBQ is located at the food court area right before the entrance to the gates. I say average because it does it's job in filling you but not  necessary make you want to return for another time. I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a food court restaurant but it's hard to when you're paying higher prices. 

The menu is what you'll expect from a transitional BBQ restaurant. BBQ ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, mac & cheese, coleslaw and cornbread. Selection is wide but the BBQ simply lacks the slow cook tenderness and taste that a traditional BBQ house delivers. I ordered the brisket, pulled pork and a side of mac and cheese. Again, everything was edible but lacks the wow factor. Everything just taste preheated and then drenched with BBQ sauce later on. Imagine heating up an expensive Stouffer's meal. That's probably the closest comparison to the meal I was served."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. I got the breakfast sandwich which comes with pulled pork on it and it was HUGE and so delicious! Fairly priced as well, especially for an airport location!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ especially considering its in an airport. Mac & cheese is very good. Service is fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. Portions are generous."}
{"text":"Thought I would get some barbecue for my flight but the service is so slow I did not get to order any food.  Four people behind the counter only one of them was serving customers. When I told them that I was not going to wait any longer they were surprised and said I didn't even know you were there.  One of the people that was there was the manager. So unless you have a lot of time I would not bother eating there."}
{"text":"Tasty bbq, quick service.  Had the pulled pork and brisket, Mac and cheese and bread.  Good comfort food."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I think the day I went, someone mistook the sugar for salt.  The pulled pork tasted like candied sawdust.  I only tasted sweet, dry and porky.  And my roll was hard and stale.  When I asked for a new one, the guy literally molested my roll looking for a soft spot on it before giving me a new roll that was EVEN WORSE.  

Grossed. 
 Out.  



Joes Farm Grille and the Joe's in Gilbert should know how grossly their food is being misrepresented."}
{"text":"Just like Joes without the drive to Gilbert! Brisket sandwich was very good. They were out of a lot of meats which was not good. Friendly staff made up for it! Nice option"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for 25 years.  We had breakfast at the Sky Harbor location on Sunday March 19th about 8 am..  The person that took our order was an African American man who was beyond rude and seemed to resent taking our order and waiting on us.  He mumbled questions about what sides we wanted with our order and when we asked him to repeat it he got a major bad attitude and snarled his answers.  We should of cancelled our order of over $30 right then and there and gone somewhere else.  Every time we asked for something, like more syrup, etc.,  he was angry and nasty towards us.  These kind of people should not be in customer service because it gives your business a bad rep.   I do not know what his problem was but is was obvious he was in a very bad mood and decided to take it out on the customer.    I hope his boss reads this information.  Thanks, Sandy"}
{"text":"The pork ribs were way too fatty.  And the skin was way too dry.  When I ordered, the guy pulled it out from under the counter.  I'm sure it's a way they store it to keep it warm but I wish they threw it on the grill for a bit.  And the coleslaw was drowning in mayo.  A little too much for me.  The bbq sauce was good.  The black cashier was super friendly."}
{"text":"Came to the airport early in the morning and saw Joe's was open. We ordered the blueberry pancakes are they did we're awesome! Piping hot, sweet and melt in your mouth good. Service was good and food came out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Decided to get dinner here before our evening flight. I got the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese. The sandwich was pretty good and I liked the sauce. The mac was alright, nothing special. Also tried the sides my boyfriend ordered. The cheesy potatoes were spicy because there was some jalapeno in it. The BBQ pit beans were good and had a lot of meat in them. The food really needed to be hotter, it was basically room temperature. If they could fix that, they may be able to earn 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have seen a lot of airports and have never bought bbq. Wouldn't be what i think would be good in an airport. But 
..i saw a couple of folks played from joes and it looked good.  I had beef ribs, chopped brisket and beans. While the sauces were a little sweet for my preference it was all very good. Good smoke and good quality. 

Easy to recommend."}
{"text":"My daughter and husband had the sampler with a couple sides.  Great price and great tasting, especially for Airport food.  The root beer is also yummy."}
{"text":"Skip it.

Good sauce. The brisket had a lot of fat on it. Strange potato salad.

For the airport, prices are in line."}
{"text":"We had horrible customer service with a hostile employee threatening my girlfriend and I. From two young adults who have worked in the service industry, we can understand a bad day on the job, but this individual was over the line unprofessional. Thankfully management reached out and offered and generously compensated us for our meals due to our experience. Management advised this employee had been managed, so hopefully we can return to enjoy the great taste of Joes BBQ."}
{"text":"So disappointing....yeah I know they had a long day but I told her what I wanted 3 times....with eye contact.  All the food was cold and the BBQ sauce was cold. What a waste of money   Not recommended"}
{"text":"With only one review to go on (since the airport location is brand new), I read reviews from the Gilbert location to decide whether to try this place. The reviews were favorable overall, so we figured we'd give it a shot. We lived in Houston for almost 9 years, so we're very particular about our brisket. Theirs is tender, but honestly it tastes like pot roast. It's good pot roast, but still disappointing if you expect to taste brisket. They have two sauces: \"hot\" (i.e. not hot), and mild. Neither has any real oomph, but they are edible. I was wary when I saw the comglomeration of beans in the baked beans-lima, kidney, pinto, etc. I've never heard of doing that. However, they were surprisingly good and were probably the highlight of my meal. Normally I hate lima beans, but I have found out I can eat them when prepared in this fashion. My husband's potato salad had large pieces of potato and was pretty decent. The cole slaw doesn't have much flavor, so I wouldn't get that again. We each had a freshly-made strawberry lemonade. I asked for light ice, and they seemed like they went out of their way to cram as much ice in as possible. All in all, not bad, yet not memorable. Three stars seems like the most fitting rating here."}
