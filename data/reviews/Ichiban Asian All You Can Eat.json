{"text":"Sushi was good but nothing special. When we asked our server for cold water instead of tea she gave us hot water. We didn't think she understood English but she should have checked with us. Other than that, the iPad ordering was nice but you need the server to \"approve\" before it gets sent to the kitchen  which is lame imo. The plates weren't all that clean as well which shocked me as the interior looked OK."}
{"text":"False advertising. It's 31.99 not the advertised 29.99 on their window and website and iPad. We reserved a week in advanced and still did not get a table enough for all of us to sit. Do not come here. It sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"I normally give good reviews but I cannot if were to be subjective about this new opening.   For the first time, was below expectation.  Second time to give it a try to see the change,same expectation did not exceed or improve upon.  Reasons:  1. Poor customer service, long waits both server to send order and receive dishes  2. Loud atmosphere and staff unorganized 3. Lack of interest in providing welcome to new guest tables 4. Location wise, not well known and design layout unnecessary 5. Unreasonable quantity size  6. Quality: freshness level below average 7. Pricing is off especially small selection choosing  8. Fail to observe tables, no duty of care  9. Slow pace, rushed at normal times when not busy 10. Unwelcome greeting of guests"}
{"text":"'good quality sashimi, they had some unique torched sushi options. Overall, it was a pretty solid AYCE - on par with Yokohama, Matsuda and ten-ichi. However, for a 32$ weekend dinner, I think kaka is a better option.   note: lineup can be very long for weekend dinners"}
{"text":"This is my fav Jap ayce currently. The food selection is superb as it provides amaebi (sweet shrimps) on a daily basis unlike ones that only have amaebi on weekends. They have a self-serve dessert and salad bar so you don't have to wait for the waiters to get you started. They have some creative food which is interesting and have nice tastes. I really love the lamb chops here and order it every time! Nice ambiance and decor. The waiters are friendly."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! U may know there was a restaurant called ten ichi on Sheppard and McGowan which used to be my no. 1 place for Ayce Japanese cuisine. But it was never good again after the new owner. So ichiban is my first choice now. Love their sashimi so fresh! And the salmon is cut to perfect size not like the other places where the pieces are so tiny ...... u gotta try their skewers too! But they are deep fried though. For under 30 dollars for weekday dinner ayce, ichiban is a good choice."}
{"text":"The service was average. Everything was done on the iPad and the food arrived pretty quickly, but the food itself didn't taste that great. The meat dishes were bland, but the sashimi and sushi were alright. Overall, the food is mediocre, but it's edible."}
{"text":"We went here for all you can eat lunch on a weekend.  Decent place for all you can eat with a fair selection of all types of asian food. From sushi, to grilled meats, noodles, etc. There are a lot of interesting they have on the menu, including sushi chips(which is literally some salmon sashimi on a pringle chip), honey garlic fried tofu, coconut milk ice cream (I dont remember what they call it, but it tasted literally like frozen coconut milk, which was delicious if you like coconut). You order everything from the iPad so it's nice to see what you'll be getting. One thing I found different was that their rolls are shorter so have only 4-6 pieces usually, unlike other places where it's usually 6-8 pieces, so even though we felt like we ordered a lot, it didn't feel like a lot of food came. This is good especially if you want to try lots of different rolls and you're in a group of 4-6.  The must try are the spare ribs, they were amazing! Very flavorful. One thing we didn't like was that some of the food didn't come hot. Some of the grilled stuff came out warm, but not like it came off the grill, more like it was sitting there for 5 minutes after it came off the grill. Maybe the kitchen is particularly cold?  Appetizers and dessert is set out in a buffet style at the back and has a few soups, a seaweed salad, jellyfish salad, some puddings, jellys, tiramisu(which was actually a little underwhelming because it was just mostly cream), and some other stuff (check the pictures others have posted).  Some of the drinks are included in the all you can eat, coke, ginger ale, fanta, etc. But they all tasted off.....like watered down and flat. Not sure why..  Food is overall good, but for some reason the meal left us a little bit unsatisfied and empty. Not that we weren't full, not that the food wasn't good, but something was missing. I still can't figure out what.  Service was fairly good, they were always around to take empty plates away or to answer questions. Food came kind of slowly, but that could also be due to the fact that we felt more food should have come faster but each roll was relatively small so we finished it really quickly.  Overall I would probably come back again, but probably only if I'd like others to come try it once, or if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Saturday night. We had a reservation for about 50 people. The restaurant and staff were very accommodating.   I really enjoyed this place as it had a good variety. You order off of an iPad for the main items, but they also have a mini soup, salad and dessert bar at the front.   The food all came out very quickly and we were all pleasantly surprised with the quality and service, even though it was extremely busy.  The servers were all very kind and even had time to make jokes with my family. We usually never experience this as we always come in such a big group, servers get annoyed with the little ones or just stressed out. I am very impressed with the service.  And compared to other AYCE placed, $28.99 is not bad at all, which includes bottomless pop.   Definitely coming back here! :)"}
{"text":"I just came home from Ichiban and boy was I disappointed. First impression of the restaurant, very modern and a HUGE space. They use iPads to order, like a lot of japanese AYCE restaurants as well. There was a area where you could get your own appetizers, soups and desserts near the sushi bar. I would have to say that the noise level there was pretty high as the place got more full. Their service wasn't as fast as I would've hoped. They seemed to be understaffed for such a large restaurant. Everytime we had to submit our order through the iPad we would have to wait for someone to come to us with their password to send it off to the kitchen. To think that they would have some sort of notice that someone wanted to send an order in.... yea, no.   We took a good look at the menu, they had some Dim Sum, some Korean dishes and some Thai dishes as well, but none looked appealing to me so I went for my defaults: Sashimi and grilled foods. They didn't have a huge variety of foods as their menu was pretty small or maybe just a lot of things weren't appealing. I would say the price is not worth it for what they have to offer. Their fish is not really fresh and they are cut in REALLY thin slices. They had a lot of interesting foods like the \"Jellyfish sushi\" and \"sashimi chip\" (which is pretty much bits of sashimi like you see in sushi rolls on top of a pringles chip) it was gross by the way. We also order a \"torched duck sushi\" which legit looked like smoked ham when it got to our table and it didn't taste that good. Everything seems overly-refrigerated, my saba sashimi was pretty much breaking as I picked it up with my chopsticks. Their beef tataki had a sauce which it was drowning in that was really sour. It seemed to have a lot of lemon juice in it which totally ruined the taste of the beef. Nevermind you can't even taste the beef.   All their grilled foods have a really sweet teriyaki sauce that ruins all the natural flavours. Their skewers ... (we tried lamb and shrimp) had a really bad odour to it. Perhaps it was the spices they have chosen to use, it smelled like someone's B.O. (like they haven't showered or anything)  I heard some music start to get louder and louder and I was wondering what was going on, apparently it was someone's birthday and they were playing the birthday song (which the beginning did not sound like it at all) and they brought out a cake with a candle and had a camera ready. I thought this was pretty cute.  Based on my overall experience, I probably will not return here but it is worth a try. Perhaps it was just my opinion on their food but hope they are successful."}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Do not go here.  Came here with family ordered bunch of drinks and food which did not come at all and only a few orders would come in after an hour so we would have to reorder and still the food did not come.   AVOID THIS PLACE!   food isnt good either. idk how this place stays in business.  Orders would come 20-30min after. le sigh."}
{"text":"Down 1 star... Food is now sloppy and taste very bland. Just average now and worse than before."}
{"text":"The customer service wasn't that bad in my opinion, I actually enjoyed eating here. The food is pretty good, will come here again"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, the waiter Aaron is so rude, he told us to hurry up to eat and we haven't even been sitting down for 1 hour and he tried to kick us out, even though the time limit to eat is 1.5 - 2 hours. He is a piece of shit. Worst place to eat at, never going back again. Food is so bad. Fucking place charged extra."}
{"text":"The soy sauce ruined everything!  The first thing I noticed was how salty the soy sauce was, it was even saltier than the soy sauce normally used for cooking only.  This is a basic ingredient yet so important as it ruins the taste for everything.  They did not offer low sodium soy sauce and later I told the waitress about it and she said here soya sauce are cooked, made by the kitchen and will transfer my comment to them.  I've been to more than 10 AYCE places in Toronto and this one differs by offering a buffet bar for salad, soup and dessert.   You get all the usual stuff like sashimi, scallop as well as torched sushi which isn't offered in many places.  Things are fresh, no complaint about the quality.  Although I find the selection is slightly less than for ex, Sushi Legend.  The Diet Coke lacked taste, probably improper setup of the pop machine.  Probably will not return,  will return to Sushi Legend."}
{"text":"This restaurant in the Splendid China Mall just opened today (November 8). I would describe it as a primarily Chinese restaurant that also serves interesting sushi. I have probably eaten at close to 30 AYCE Japanese restaurants, and I found this restaurant to be a treat due to its different menu. The food in the soup and salad bar was primarily Chinese. The Sushi had some interesting twists. There were 2 different types of sushi that used duck. The Ichiban Special Roll contains asparagus.2 different types of soft ice cream are available. I also tried the Cherry Fruit Slush.   The lunch price is slightly higher than most AYCE restaurants; however the lunch menu contains items that are not normally on a lunch menu. For example, I was surprised to see beef tataki available at lunch. Update: It appears that they were also surprised to see it on the lunch menu. I understand that it was supposed to be only on the dinner menu.  Since I have eaten at so many sushi joints, I was not surprised to be greeted by 2 people that I knew. Obviously, I was well treated by the managers and the servers.  In summary, I am glad that I ate here and will return."}
{"text":"I loved ichiban when it recently newly opened, the fish was fresh and the way they cooked their stir fry and other food was delicious. Service was fast and I enjoyed it. I haven't been there for months and I went to eat with my friend yesterday and I felt like a lot of the quality of the food has changed. The fish was very soft and it had a strong oder to it... and the stir fry wasn't as good as it used to be. There were several things I enjoyed still such as their pan fried black cod , black chicken herbal soup etc. The service also wasn't as great, employees stood around a lot and it was hard to get their attention.. I was also just having a good time catching up with a friend and I felt like the employee tried rushing us to get out because we were there for just about over an hour ... don't get me wrong, some other workers there did their job well. I do hope that the food was how it was like before. Maybe I will come back another time hoping things change ..."}
{"text":"First thing to note about Ichiban: AC was out of order when I went on Friday and it was insanely hot & stuffy inside. People at other tables around us were also complaining, and some chose to cut their meal short and leave - it was that bad. So if you decide to eat here, if you notice it's super warm once you step inside, you're probably better off coming back another day.   That being said, you're not missing much if you decide not to go here anyway. The food quality is typical AYCE fare, though following another popular AYCE joint in Markham, Ichiban serves some torch-style sushi too, which you can order via iPad. There are only a couple options of this type of sushi though, so not worth it if you're coming for seared sushi alone.   There's a tiny self-serve bar at the back (right next to the bathroom...) where you can pick up soup, salad, fruit, and a plastic shotglass of dessert, like \"mango sago\" which is basically mango juice with a few sago balls and a couple lychee-flavoured popping boba floating in there. I can see why they'd do the DIY, because there aren't many servers and it's not easy flagging them down.   I appreciated that sweet shrimp sashimi, scallop sashimi, and a seared duck sushi were available, but everything just tasted so bland, uninspired, and of so-so quality. Wouldn't particularly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday night, planning to celebrate an early Thanksgiving dinner with my family. It's astonishing how pricey AYCE meals have become; on the holiday, and in Fridays and weekends this place is $30 for dinner. Although my family doesn't eat much now, we thoroughly enjoyed this meal!  I'll start off with the soup and salad bar. My favourite part of the bar was definitely the chicken mushroom soup. Its taste was so umami and flavourful! It was also very hot and delicious. My dad has multiple servings of this soup. I also really enjoyed the jellyfish salad, and helped myself to a healthy serving of seaweed salad (one of my favourite foods).  We ordered a bunch of food, but nothing came for the while. Some of the grilled stuff was gradually served, but the sashimi took a while. That being said, the manager came to check up on us when he found we weren't eating, reminding us kindly about the salad bar. I told him that we've gone for seconds and thirds already, but our food hasn't come for almost 10 minutes. He was very kind and immediately went into the kitchen/bar to check up on th order for us. The food came out shortly afterwards!  Overall, it was a very good meal! My favourites were definitely the scallops and ebi - they were very sweet (albeit small and not that meaty). I also adored the salmon sashimi... it was a decent size and also very sweet and tasty. Another must order is definitely the lamb! We saw many different tables order multiple servings of this dish.  One mistake we did make, however, was order ramune. We thought that the marble soda pop was free, as no price was noted on the iPad. Only after we submitted the order did we note that there was $3.50 on the bill. It was our fault, but careful not to make the same mistake!"}
{"text":"Inside Spledid China Tower (use Restaurant entrance)  They only take CASH and CREDIT (No debit) Coke not included (starting at $1) No liquor license yet iPad ordering Fast service Spacious arrangements with private rooms Clean Good service  Weekend Menu ($28.99): Cold dishes, salad, soup, stew and dessert is available at walk up salad bar They have Jelly Fish ?? and cooked mussels in broth at the salad bar Small pieces  Some unique creations Typhoon style fried shrimp is good esp if you like garlic Lamb skewer is good Beef tongue is okay but usually ayce don't have They have CRAB LEGS Unique rolls They have Jelly Fish Sushi Torched Sushi is pretty good (hey have duck sushi too) Sashimi was meh ... it's okay (herbal white tuna and beef sashimi is served with a citric sauce in case you don't like sour) They have frozen yogurt Pistachio frozen yogurt has cherry taste (I hate cherry)  Overall decent place, I'd come back. Seems to be better than the previous restaurant that was here.  They also serve weekday set lunch special starting at $6.95."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for almost 20 years now. When they started off as a la carte, and  Teppanyaki, to the few renovations to now AYCE. I went there again last night and the quality has dropped significantly. I use to think Tenichi was one of the best, but after last night experience I will no longer go back again. The food was horrible. Most AYCE to me, tastes the same but last night the food last tasted different. They surf clams and raw scallops were super tiny. The torched sushi did not taste good. The flounder fish had no taste to it, the mackerel was not good. Dessert was just as bad. I can tell they changed the recipe for Mango Yogurt. The mango puree did not taste the same and also there was no flavour in the yogurt. Some places have a hint of almond taste to it. The ginger milk was cold and not solidified. The overall food was just disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of Ayce places, but this one isn't bad. Service is always super prompt/helpful when I'm here. I like how they have a salad/dessert bar where you can help yourself. Perfect for impatient people who want to eat immediately, like me. Large variety of food in their menu and their fish is pretty fresh. Their rolls arent amazing and can easily fall apart, but still not bad. The hot food is pretty good as well. This is my family's current favorite Ayce place, will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Typical decent Japanese AYCE place. Dark interior, pretty spacious, and clean. They had a soup bar and a dessert table with the classic mango yogurt, mango sago, tiramisu and GRASS JELLY IN MILK TEA! That part was pretty awesome. Menu on Ipad and everything came pretty fast. They had torched sushi which to me just tasted like cooked fish on rice LOL not much added colour on slight charcoal flavour. They also had these rectangular prism shaped ones in a slightly sour cream sauce - pretty but too much unneeded sauce. Everything else was honestly as expected, nothing super outstanding. Octopus balls so oily. Liked how they took away empty plates frequently though."}
{"text":"Poor service.  From the moment I ordered the food, we ordered 20 pieces of salmon rose sushi. But everything came and we even ordered a second batch of foods, and the salmon rose sushi still hasn't arrived. We tried asking waiters but not a single one responded. Finally, a waiter come and we told the waiter to check on the order after we waited for an hour and a half, and they gave us only 15 pieces from the original 20. So we reordered 10 pieces of it, and it didn't come, so we had to check on it with the server. But after waiting some time they still gave us 9 pieces, one short from what we ordered. Don't know what make these salmon rose sushi so precious."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi AYCE in the GTA.   The cooked foods here are phenomenal. Items like rack of lamb, typhoon shrimp, cheese mussels, crab legs, torched salmon sushi, torched duck sushi make up some of the best offerings a sushi ayce has ever offered.   The most obvious problem for this restaurant is that it's in a dead mall of Splendid China. Reservations are recommended for weekends but generally the place isn't very busy.   The walk up help yourself salad bar is very interesting. It saves everyone time. The salad bar allows for ayce jelly fish, seaweed salad, beef something lol (it's an asian beef dish...) and various soups and desserts.   If you're a fan of sushi rolls though, be warned that this is not their speciality. It's definitely cooked kitchen foods. I recommend sushi legend for sushi rolls.   Matsuda is not as good anymore. Yangs sushi has been downhill for a while. Kiku is downhill. Syogun is absolute trash.  Try this place! At $28.99 on weekends, this is one of the few remaining good sushi ayce in Markham/Scarborough."}
{"text":"I wont say they are the best, but I rather say their service is fast and efficient. Good quality of food & like the ordering on the tablet. Came here for our pre-Valentine date."}
{"text":"Never ever come back here!  After half year I came back here, the quality are drop significantly. Hot item and rolls are huge, feels like they wanna you to be full.   It also makes me  DIARRHEA . Will not recommend people come and spend 27 dollars for this ayce"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a work event. The food was great. It has quite a selection. Everything was great and no bad experience. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Now to be honest everything that I tried was very tasteful. There was not anything that I can say which was negative.  I would go back and recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service 1/10 - omg horrible Food 7/10  This is one of those places where you wish the service matched the food. Service is horrendous here. No acknowledgements, no simple manners and oh yeah my table of 4 was rudely asked to leave a bit after an hour because they wanted the table back. To make it worse, I asked for the bill to be split into 2 and got ignored. One bill arrives and I ask again for 2 bills and got ignored while the waiter stood there....... If you don't want to split up the bill at least tell me vs not saying anything. How do these waiters get hired without even common decency to communicate and do their job?  It's not entirely fair to be 100% negative about this place. They got some really good all you can eat menu items like scallop sashimi, lamb chops and duck sushi. I personally enjoy their salmon sashimi and the random fish.  Hopefully the service improves!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Saturday. We needed 8 seats, so they just pulled up an extra table and made 8 seats for us. Not too bad, since most chinese places do this (lol)  They use tablets, which makes things a bit easier because we just had to enter how many orders we wanted of each item, and there were pictures of each item as well.  Food variety for lunch is alright. Doesn't come with sashimi, but I suppose that's why lunch is about $10 less than dinner.  Due to the lack of sashimi, we figured we'll just go with the sushi. Although we ordered 8 pieces of each sushi, they had 8 pieces of the butterfish and salmon, but only served up one piece of everything else. When we looked at the order summary on the tablet, we noticed they were all changed to 1 piece instead of 8 pieces. This was a consistent trend throughout the meal. Not sure if they deliberately changed the order counts or something on particular items.  Taste was just ok. We were all full 2 hours later, but not too sure if I like the order changing at their own discretion."}
{"text":"A lot of the items that we ordered never arrived despite ordering them multiple times, one item in particular never made its appearance even after 3 rounds of ordering.  We finally had to flag a waitress down and order it in person instead of the iPad.  Also had to constantly flag someone down to have our drinks refilled.  The staff is completely unorganized and occasionally you can see them standing around talking to each other instead of servicing customers."}
{"text":"Come here with my cousins all the time. One of my favourite places to go to, especially for their sashimi and unagi sushi. The sashimi is extremely fresh, and the pieces are in the perfect size. The atmosphere is nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Honestly, wasn't a fan. The food was ridiculously too common. They didn't have alot of specialties. The rolls were really small which is good for AYCE I guess. . Barely any veg options. Just had cucumber and avocado rolls. The tempura we're really soggy. Steak was good and meaty. The fries were also crunchy and yummy.  MY favourite dish was the grilled tofu.  The service was bad. We asked about 5 times for extra plates or clarification and they would say they would come back but they didn't.  They forgot alot of our dishes too so we had to keep reordering. Using an iPad to order is cool."}
{"text":"Not the tidiest or most organized restaurant, but what I really enjoyed about this place was the novelty and variety of foods that it offered.  Of all the Japanese all-you-can-eats that I've been to, this place had the most intriguing menu. From jellyfish sushi to black rice balls to Korean bulgogi wraps to okra to torched duck sushi, I was overall very content with the options that were being offered. While some better than others, everything tasted great and I had no complaints about the food.   However, they were clearly understaffed and the service was rushed and inattentive. The replenishment of the desserts at the self-serve was also lacking. My family and I went at around 8pm and all of the desserts had already been taken. I assumed that it was because the first cycle of dinner customers had just finished up their meals and that they would bring out more later but throughout my entire hour's stay at the restaurant, no new desserts were brought out.  Thankfully, the food was good enough that I was already completely stuffed at the end of my meal and wasn't too sad about the lack of desserts."}
{"text":"went for AYCE lunch there, nice decor, Host was really nice. he explained what was included, how to order and what is out in the self-serve fridge - soups, salads & desserts 1st round of service was fast after that slows down not sure really if it is because it got busy or they forgot about us? this happens typically anyways at AYCEs other that that food was good and will definitely go back. drink was included - pop only and tea served in a pot at each table, any other type you have to pay. food selection was not to bad, pretty comparable to other bigger AYCEs in the vicinity. they didn't have chicken teriyaki which we were craving for  thier korean glass noodles of course didn't taste authentic..taste was more chinese style noodle food and pricing for lunch, I would go back again"}
{"text":"Went Sat after after work approx 6:15pm and the place was busy; thankfully no line up though.  I loved the self serve soup and salad station. Smart idea for those who are impatient... gives you something to do while waiting for your order to be executed. All in all, I found the service prompt, friendly and attentive. Never really had to wait for anything as iPad orders were acknowledged remotely (which meant that you didn't have to flag down a waiter for anything). The food was surprisely good....not exceptional but better than average.  If you happen to be there, try their torched duck breast roll.  I never thought it would taste good with duck- but it did! It was not dry at all (please see attached photo)."}
{"text":"I made reservations for Mother's Day, already knowing it will be busy but did not expect this level of unprofessionalism.   There were many people standing outside of the store waiting to be seated and my family was one of them. Mabel, the hostess guided our family to unclean tables 15mins after our reservation time. The people who were cleaning the table rudely told us not to wait at the table even though Mabel directed us to the table and to be readied to be seated. Then, Mabel yelled at us not to wait at the table because it is pressuring them (even though she was the one who guided us to the table first??) I understand it was busy and workers are stressed by the high volume of people but the disorganization and rude behaviour we received ruined our whole dining experience and our expectations of the restaurants.   We didn't get much service as food was ordered through the iPad and there is a self-serve salad bar at the back. Food was mediocre, nothing stood out even though they had some Chinese, Korean and Thai food on their menu. We didn't order any Chinese, Korean or Thai food so the menu was quite limited.  We were left unimpressed by the food and the service we received."}
{"text":"Ichiban All You Can Eat has a salad bar and dessert station where you can select items from in addition to using their iPad ordering system on the table to order as many Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Korean dishes as you want in a 1.5 to 2-hour time limit.   It was a very straight-forward evening of dining in and using the iPad to order what we wanted to eat.  Everything was clearly organized according to food categories.  To my surprise and satisfaction, after we ordered our food and submitted the order, the food arrived almost instantaneously.  The delicious sashimi stood out for me as well as the grilled eggplant, steamed egg, chicken soup with herbs and mushroom (from the salad bar), lamb ribs, Torched Duck Sushi, and beef sashimi.  The sashimi were sliced so thinly!  Overall, I enjoyed the Japanese all-you-can-eat dinner at Ichiban All You Can Eat.   I really liked their professional and polite service.  I advise that if you go, try going during their weeknights or during lunch hours so that the AYCE price is more worth it."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for AYCE Japanese/Chinese food in the Markham and Scarborough area! It's just across the street from Pacific Mall.   There are a lot of choices to choose from on the iPad and the food usually comes very fast, even during their rushes. Drinks like pop and juice are all included in the ayce price. They also have a section in the restaurant where you can get up and help yourself with soups, appetizers (salads and fruit) and desserts (tiramisu, yogurt, pudding).   The manager is very friendly, he usually stops by and checks up on you and asks how everything is. It's nice to know he genuinely cares how the customers think about the restaurant.   Overall, pretty worth for AYCE. It can get very busy at times, so book in advance or go early!"}
{"text":"This was a nice place in the heart of Markham. A great all-you-can-eat that where the kitchen is open until 10:30pm.  We arrived late at about 10 and they allowed us to stay and eat until about midnight. At the end of the night the staff was having a meeting.. which sounded like they were yelling at each other. We ordered a lot of food in fear of not being able to order later, so they charged us an extra $5 to take it home which was nice!   The food was a 3 star quality. I've had better at all-you-can-Eats. However the best part was the dessert. They had this deep fried round looking dessert with hot creme inside (not sure what that was). The waitressing staff was great!   Finally, my biggest qualm was the bathroom. It was dirty and the soap was pretty much water filled in a soap bottle. Felt like they filled up an almost empty soap bottle with water... not cool since you have to eat a lot with your hands!"}
{"text":"Went by to Ichiban All You Can Eat as it was one of the newer AYCEs around Scarborough. Decided to give it a shot even though the restaurant turnover in Splendid China Tower is pretty high.  Reserved a table and came here for lunch. We were seated fast and the restaurant was about a third full. We were given an iPad for our orders and was also notified that there was a mini buffet table by the side.  From the mini buffet table, there were salads (seaweed salad and mango salad), desserts and soups like miso soup & hot and sour soup.  I really liked the Boiled Chicken with Chinese Herbs & Mushroom Soup. It tasted better than I thought, reminds me of a home-made herbal soup. It is pretty good for an ayce place. I drank about 5 - 6 of these while I was here, haha.  Some of our meal consisted of: These fried crunchy tofu! Loved the sauce and crunch while eating it. Nigiri sushi! Salmon, white fish, white tuna, surf clam sushi with salmon rose and spicy salmon sushi as well. Shrimp Tempura Assorted maki rolls - I don't remember which ones we ordered... Salmon and Avocado Handroll - Lately I've been liking handrolls, plus I love avocado!  After that, it was dessert time. They have options on the iPad as well as by the buffet table, like mango yogurt, cream coffee pudding, coconut grass jelly, strawberry mousse, mango sago cream, etc. I only tried the cream coffee pudding - it was really good. Reminds me of an affogato.  We also ordered ice cream through the iPad -  pistachio, vanilla soft serve, red bean and green tea. The pistachio ice cream tasted nothing like pistachio... tasted like plain soft serve.... quite nasty actually.  Overall, this place was just okay. Food came by in a good amount of time. Only our ice cream took awhile, and we had to notify a server about that. We found the menu to be limited as compared to other Japanese restaurants during lunch time. The washrooms here was kinda nasty, and they leave the main washroom doors open as well. I saw a mom bringing in her around 8-10 year old boy in the female washroom to pee. & His mom stood \"guard\" while her boy peed without closing the door. I felt super uncomfortable... Plus she was yelling at him the whole time to wash his hands, to pee, to hurry up and stuff. We made a complaint to the manager about it (since I think there's a law about the age limit of boys going into female washrooms?) but who knows if they're really going to do something about it..  Either way, this place is just a solid 3 in my books."}
{"text":"This place is where the Shanghai restaurant, used to be.  We came for the lunch buffet today.  We arrived at 1.20pm and were stood at the front desk for 10 minutes.  The servers couldn't see us because there is a big wall full of wine bottles, which blocks your view.  So we walked around the partition hoping a server would acknowledge us but they were all busy.  We wanted to walk out but a waitress saw us and then seated us.    They have a good variety of foods, for a lunch menu.  Then there's the self serve salad/soup/dessert bar.  All the foods we ordered were nice, albeit rather small and dinky.  But that means you can get more variety and try more things.  The ordering is all done on an ipad  but you need to call a server over to put the order into the kitchen.    A nice place to come for AYCE.  Soft drinks are included in the price.  Parking here is really good because this mall is desserted, so you won't have a problem finding a space.    Servers aren't particuarly friendly. Walk into the restaurant when there's no hostess, you won't be seen otherwise."}
{"text":"A broad selection with special items like lamb chops, sweet shrimp and scallop sashimi, and duck breast"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Japanese Restaurant. You order on a tablet, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is warm and beautiful. I love the large variety of Japanese and Chinese food."}
{"text":"The service is pretty quick, but there is no interactions with the servers, they drop the food on the table so quick and disappears. except for this one young gentleman who actually came over and asked up how we're doing (in english) everyone else just drops the food on the table. and even when you are ready to order the food they don't speak.  the food is ok, not that high quality, be decent for all you can eat. the desserts are horrible, very runny. and the salad bar is pointless (just put it on the menu....) instead of making us walk over there when there is only 4 choices."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We ordered from the iPad and service was ok. We ordered pretty much everything from the menu. From rolls to tempura to dessert, everything tasted pretty good. When it came to service, some waiters were pretty friendly but others just looked like they didn't care. For pricing, we checked online beforehand just to arrive at the restaurant to find out that the prices online are 'outdated'. Overall, I would give 8/10."}
{"text":"My go to ayce sushi. They offer a variety of items on their ipad service menu which makes things quick and free from staff mistakes when jotting stuff down. On weekends they have rack of lamb which is one big reason why I like coming here. They also offer a variety of sashimi which includes octopus, scallop and shrimp. Their rolls (maki) are a hit or miss, but I usually don't order many rolls as they fill me up. I usually just order their soft shell crap roll. Prices are similar to other ayce sushi in the area, but because of the location, variety of items, ipad ordering, free pop, and easy access salad, soup and appetizer bar, it wins me over other places."}
{"text":"Fairly impressed, I'd have to say, considering that this is an AYCE restaurant.   The service was surprisingly pleasant (although that might just have been the manager). My plate was dirty and when I asked for a new one, he actually apologized before saying he would immediately bring me a clean one. I can't think of any other Chinese-run restaurant that would apologize first before getting another plate. Most of them just take your plate and leave.   The iPad ordering is interesting. It was my first time playing with it. What I liked was that I could see what had been ordered previously, and what was going into my order this time. I also like how detailed their food quantities are. I asked for one temari ball (assuming that it was one order with all the different varieties, because there was no individual variety ordering for those), and I got exactly one temari ball. It was actually amusing and awkward and also slightly disappointing.   I like that they have things like lamb skewers and torched sushi even on their weekday dinner menu. I also like that they have things on their menu that other Japanese AYCE places don't, like red tuna sushi, torched duck sushi, beef shank at the salad bar, jellyfish salad, typhoon shrimp, etc. Oh. They also have pistachio (and other) frozen yogurt. They also have something like Caesar salmon (raw)? Thankfully, it doesn't taste like Caesar dressing.  Most of their food tasted somewhere between average and good. Some highlights included their torched sushi (duck, white tuna, salmon) although the duck was pretty much just smoked duck, their beef teriyaki, and their typhoon shrimp. Their typhoon shrimp was served piping hot and it came with little deep fried silver fishes! Some letdowns included their diced beef cubes (too much tenderizer. No beef flavor.), their beef tataki (the sauce was atypical in a way that I did not particularly enjoy), and their pistachio frozen yogurt did not taste in any way like pistachios. For dessert, the grass jelly in coconut milk was tasteless, the mango pudding was too sweet, and they ran out of mango yogurt by the time I wanted dessert (9:15-9:30pm on a Wednesday night). Their green tea ice cream is not bad. At least it tastes like green tea. Their deep fried coconut custard (deep fried milk anyone?) was delicious and came in adorable little cubes!   They also have slushes that come in shot glasses. They taste like frozen juice concentrate mixed with slushy water. These are not bad if you want a drink but don't want to pay for one. On that note, on to specials!  They have a special where if you like and share the appropriate post on their Facebook page, you get a free soft drink. If you like another one of their posts, you can get an offer emailed to you where if you go on Friday with a party of 5, the cheapest dinner price is taken off your total bill (essentially, buy 4 get 1 free).  If I had to choose a place to do AYCE Japanese food, I would probably choose here."}
{"text":"A popular All You Can Sushi place in Scarborough that I usually go to for good sushi. We came here for lunch for the all you can option and it was about $16 for lunch which wasn't too bad. You ordered everything through the iPAD so my friend and I ordered a bunch of foods ranging from sushi rolls, chicken wings, calamari, tempura, skewers and ramen. They have a variety of options for food here. Soft drinks are included in the price. They also have a salad bar area where they have some cold apps and desserts that you can come while you wait for your food. The food came out relatively quickly within 5-10 minutes, we received our entire order. My favoruites are the spicy salmon rolls, salmon rose sushi, the beef ribs and the wings. Those are my favoruite orders from this restaurant. Lastly, we ordered the usual desserts of ice cream and they have the green tea, mango, red bean and vanilla flavours. Overall, a decent dining experience and one of my go to sushi places in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet. Price went up again. Saw posting few month ago was 15.99 and now 16.99.   Food - 3/5   Service - 3/5   Lunch menu is very limited, no sashimi. Oh , dirty washroom :\"( Don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for lunch and took advantage of their 8.99 ayce special for their maki rolls only. It also included a salad and two choices of soup. I can say I left being full and having major itis. Their Cesar salad was surprisingly good as it wasn't really a Cesar salad, but had instead a poppy Seed dressing, raisins and a spring mix of lettuce. Their rolls were decent, nothing special; Your typical small amount of sashimi accompanied by other toppings. They had a decent selection: ranging from spicy salmon to red dragon roll. The sashimi in the rolls tasted fresh and Iwould definitely come back to give their regular menu a try :)"}
{"text":"So I tried this place for the first time on Friday. First off, it is located in Spendid China Tower. So I went here for lunch and I believe it was around $16.99.   Interior and decoration wise, it is quite nice. I just found it a bit stuffy and i don't know man I got sat down between two tables and they were quite close to mine. Like I swear any closer and the other customer's butt would be touching my food.... like maybe space it out a little more. That way, I wouldn't have to worry about people's booty in close proximity to my food LOL   Anyways, food wise, it is pretty good. Some were a little weird but overall the food didn't taste too bad. I guess a cool aspect to this restaurant is that you order through an iPad. That's great in the sense that I don't have to do so much talking with the servers, but I also feel like it's quite bothersome if I want to ask for specifics about certain foods (like removing all sauce on grilled salmon or whatever). But yeah, there is a variety of different things to choose from to eat. (BUT, for ME I wish there was a bit more? like throw in some  deep fried scallops or idk SOMETHING)  I don't know if it was just my table, but the servers kept getting our orders wrong?! Like they brought us several things that we didn't even order. And this punk of a dude was insisting that he brought the right order to me like ?! YOU GOOD I DIDNT ORDER SEAFOOD RAMEN. I ORDERED PORK RAMEN. There was CLEARLY seafood visible and he was like no no that's pork like *about to hit rage mode here LOL* but yeah y'all need to keep in mind that you might not get your orders (prob because they at another table) and you might end up getting stuff you didn't order. :D   Probably would not come back again but I would recommend 1. Pork Ramen (ramen, bamboo shoots, one small piece of pork) 2. some kind of Korean beef wrap  3. SHRIMP DUMPLINGS WERE PRETTY GOOD 4. Yogurt pudding (these are not on the menu; you need to grab it at the corner of the restaurant or something)"}
{"text":"I've come here twice so far. The food is typical for what you can expect from an AYCE sushi place.   They have ipad ordering here and the food comes fast after you order. There is also a self serve section for certain appetizers and desserts.   On my last visit, our first order was miniature for some reason. When I say miniature, I mean miniature. All the sashimi were cut really small and even the rolls were small. The rest of the orders that night were all normal sized though. I have no idea what happened to the first order.   On my first visit here we had to wait half an hour to be seated although we made reservations. On my second visit we did not make reservations but had to wait a long time at the front just for an employee to come so that we can tell them how many people were in our group.  As the other recent reviews here have stated, they did change their prices but they never updated it anywhere. We were left with an unpleasant surprise when the bill came.   This place would be 3 stars based on the food but the long wait time to be seated despite making a reservation and the unstated change in prices drags this place down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????all you can eat???????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We came here as a group based on the marketing/advertisement and it came with 10% discount (newspaper advertisement or you can obtain it from www.ccue.ca) which was a bit attractive to come and try this place out...  I usually don't have extremely high expectations for AYCE due to the fact that you're paying for quantity instead of quality...so I was expecting subpar quality...  I guess a lot of places are implementing the iPad order yourself which makes it look tech savvy...but I didn't like the fact for this place..after entering you had to click on \"call server\" and your server comes to \"approve\" your request with their password, that was a bit inconvenient...  The Yeah(s):  - nice and spacious tables  - go grab your own semi-appys (I.e. soup and some salads and desserts) - small pieces of sushi...so you can get more variety  - thinly slices of sashimi (too many places cut way too thick) - each person was allowed 2 Alaska crab legs  - torched sushi (not crazy reservations like KaKa @ fmp)  The Naah(s)  - minimal English and Canto spoken by servers - subpar freshness  - soft drinks add $1 per person  - overpriced ($28.99 pp@adults, $12.99 for kids 3-9, kids @ 3 really can't eat that much)  The restaurant itself had a contemporary design and it was quite spacious. Everyone only knew how to speak mandarin, which didn't help, as my mandarin is very bad. English and Canto was not widely spoken. I think only the manager or the boss spoke minimal of both languages.  If the 10% off stays on as a long term promo, I may be more tempted to come back."}
{"text":"First of all, who shops at Splendid China Mall? You wouldn't even think about coming here to eat... I have definitely had better AYCE sushi. I see the hype about order through an ipad, but even then, it's not accurate. We were missing 5 things that we ordered the first round and still never came after following up twice with the server. The only positive thing about ichiban was the large cuts of salmon and white tuna sashimi. Seemed very fresh."}
{"text":"There are so many Japanese AYCE restaurants around now, so being a newer location, you really gotta up your game to compete! Pricing is no longer the deciding factor with places like these because lets face it, if you're going AYCE, you're expecting to spend quite a bit for this meal. This wouldn't be in my top 3 choices for AYCE but i wouldn't say never...  Service was fast and mains were good, but everything else was meh. Staff here were a bit off... not rude or anything but.. it's a bit weird how they talk to us. And I was literally eating and the staff (WITHOUT SAYING EXCUSE ME) reaches BETWEEN ME AND MY ARM (which is held up cause I was literally eating) to grab an empty plate ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ME....... I dont know.. I feel like she was day dreaming.. All we did was stare and kinda wonder \"wth...?\"  Just all around, it was either alright or questionable. Anyway, it was a pretty decent weeknight. It was maybe half full in the restaurant. There's a self serve salad/ soup/ dessert bar which is rather disappointing looking with all the wilted leaves and very mediocre desserts. They had a special Chinese style broth/soup available but they didn't refill it.. staff noticed but... nada. They didn't actually refill anything that night so I'm not sure how that works.  Anyway. To the food! We ordered pretty much a bit of everything (they use the iPad ordering system). The thing I was a HUGE FAN of was their version of the torched sushi with some green and red veggies on top. It tasted good, kept its shape, and a great one-biter. The rest of the sushi really left little to be desired. They were soggy, poorly rolled/put together, and luke-warm. Nothing worse than consistently warm sushi. They did have some good hand rolls though, and they fill it to the bottom so you're not stuck with rice at the end. I really appreciate that attention to detail there. Their fried foods were pretty good as well and the cooked food was decent. I am a HUGE short ribs lover and normally I'm not too picky cause short ribs almost always taste good. Theirs was really bland.. just a basic sweet sauce but the meat had no flavor. I would recommend the lamb skewers though. Those were pretty good.   Like I said... not my top 3.. but would probably return."}
{"text":"Located inside Splendid mall, this AYCE sure place is the best I've had so far. They got a good selection of menu items from dumplings, to bulgogi, to basil chicken. The quality pretty good for an AYCE place. Spent $42 for two people for Sunday lunch tips and all. Not bad."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place. I went for AYCE lunch on Tuesday, it wasn't that busy. Ambient is nice, a bit tight but ok. They use iPads to order, which is nice. I found that the menu was very limited compared to others AYCE. I wasn't impressed by their sushi rolls, for me it kinda was missing some taste and it didn't seem that fresh. The tempura shrimp was dense and a bit raw, which was disappointing. I ordered another batch but had the same problem. Not a big variety of desserts.. Service was VERY slow even though it wasn't that busy. One of the servers kept talking to his friend that was there, kinda ignoring us, which was very unprofessional! Won't be returning there"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of my friends. Overall experience less than average. Food selection is less than other restaurant. Food quality is also less than average. I should have known when I read the Chinese name of the restaurant. Its operated by mainland Chinese, so you can guess how authentic the Japanese food is. Not saying all mainland Chinese operated ones are bad, but this one you don't need to try. The only good thing is the price is also cheaper compare to the others."}
{"text":"you order via an ipad so you will get what you order.  the food comes to you in a very timely manner.  food is pretty good.  there is a salad bar for soups, sweets, cookies, seaweed, salad and more......waiting staff was good, friendly and helpful.    i have only one bad thing to say about this joint :  when i came back home i had to drink 3 litres of water to quench my m.s.g. induced thirst!!!!   i can tell you one thing.  i am not coming back here."}
{"text":"Just had the all you can eat lunch. Service was excellent and we were seated quickly upon arrival.   There's a salad/soup bar at the front which wasn't pointed out to us and we figured it out much later in the meal so we did not get to partake.   Sushi was delicious as was the rest of their robust menu.   Friendly attentive staff to make the experience even better."}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat Japanese restaurant. It's located inside Splendid China mall. Been here a few times, once when it first opened and more recently.   They have a self serve salad/soup bar and dessert station. They have a large selection of sushi, rolls, tempura, beef, chicken and seafood dishes. The plus is all you can drink. I like the short ribs, shrimp tempura, rose sushi, spicy salmon nachos, and bulgogi bao. They do many dishes well. But I have to say there rolls are just ok.  Been to many AYCE in Scarborough and Markham. In terms of selection it's similar to other ayce, the food quality okay. Overall it's good."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday evening. Very busy and waited 30 mins to get a table for 4. Once we ordered, sashimi and sushi came very quickly. The server also brought the high chair to my baby, and after I told her the age of him, she recommended us not to use high chair but booster, my baby is a little big in his age. That made me very comfortable to sit there while waiting.   Hot food came a little bit slow. It took about 30mins to get a squid, which I think they need to improve it. Their sushi is so far the best that I've tried in Scarborough and Markham, I'll definitely come back to eat.   A little bit pricey for a small glass of apple juice, $2.50 and without refills, which made them lose one star."}
{"text":"Was here with a group of friends for dinner. There is a salad bar area which you can get your own soup, salads and dessert. Only 2 kind of soup available which is the Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup (very watered down) and the Miso Soup. Salad includes Jellyfish, seaweed salad, mango salad and Cesar salad. As for desserts, not much variety, nothing stood out as they are pretty generic.   As for the food, the weekend special is the lamb rack and it took forever to come! We had the 6pm seating and had to ask at least 3x. Although, The sashimi was pretty fresh and hand rolls were good. But the torch sushi and sushi rolls weren't that good (I've tried better) I think the main reason why I gave this place a 2 star is because the service was not good, food came out slow, and the interior decor. It was very dark inside, dim lighting and felt really crammed. If you read my previous review on Sushi Legend, the experience is way better. Although this place also have iPad ordering but the selection is very limited. The price is $32.99 on weekends. There is also a birthday month special as well."}
{"text":"An average place for sushi. The food here is nothing special. Their sashimi was cut small in comparison to other AYCE restaurants. There's nothing special about the rolls either. They have torched sushi but I'm not a fan. Their lamb racks were good, only limit one per customer though.   I like how they have ipad ordering. It allows us to keep track of what we've ordered, what came, and it reduced the need to try and flag time a waiter each time we wanted to order more food. As it is with many establishments, it is often difficult to flag down the attention of the servers so I'm quite happy to be able to skip this step.   I also liked their little self-serve section at the back of the store where you can go and help yourself to various appetizers and desserts. I LOVE their mango desserts. I like to keep the collection of little shot glasses in front of me to keep track of how many I've had.   Service wise, despite the fact that we made a reservation, we still had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi ayce I've ever had in Toronto. I thought Spring Sushi and Spring rolls ayce were mediocre, but this place took the cake. For a weekday price, a meal for 2 was $70. Crazy ass price for a joke meal.  Presentation was nice but the everything was disgusting in terms of taste. Rice was mushy, the rolls and sashimi were not fresh at all and their special duck rolls were extremely dry. The only thing they have going for them are the crispy tofu but who cannot make that in the comfort of their home for less than $5? I feel bad for being so mean as the service they provided was kind and attentive. Sorry Ichiban but you definitely aren't Ichiban."}
{"text":"My first impression was that the place looked good. It's a dimly lit all you can eat restaurant that's great for friends, families, and groups. A tablet is used to order food. The food was fantastic. My favourites, in order, include the ribs, mango desserts, lamb skewers, and salmon sashimi. Service, while not super attentive, was sufficient. I took off a star because food never comes in the ordered amount. It's not a huge deal because I can simply order more, but considering the time limits, it's annoying to wait for servers to confirm your order and the kitchen to make it. Overall, it's one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"Ichiban is a great place as an AYCE restaurant. It would worth you a visit if you are nearby. Since the main language used in the menu is Chinese, it is good for Chinese newcomers here in Toronto.   I came in with my parents at around 11:15, which is right after they opened, the orders came with a steady pace, and waiters did not misplace any order on other tables nor misplaced order on mine.  The overall environment in this restaurant is rather confusing. As an AYCE restaurant, it has some very dim lighting, which in my own perspective is not comfortable to stay at. Tables and couches are clean enough to sit on and have a meal but worth notice.   Food are fairly fresh and well presented. The eel was a bit cold from Eel Avocado Roll; Salmon on the chips was not as fresh as what they served for sushi and etc. Also there's NO SASHIMI in lunch, if you would like to have just the \"meat\", you have to go there during dinner service."}
{"text":"My group of 7 went on a Monday night around 6pm. We reserved early the week before. Upon arrival, they found our reservation but squeezed us into a table of 6. Not comfortable at all. When I requested for a larger table (I reserved!) the host told us there were no more. So bad organization from the start. Our orders were done through an iPad. We were iPad-less for the first 10 minutes. Order can sporadically. We had to reorder certain items twice before they actually came. The most annoying part of everything was the price. The website and the poster outside says weekend was $29.99 (it was a holiday). Apparently it is $31.99 per person, BEFORE TAX OR TIPS. This was not what was advertise.   Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We waited for an hour to be seated, which was a bit ridiculous if you're super hungry. The sashimi and sushi was average like other locations, but their specialty dishes were good, the lamb chops were surprisingly so tender and delicious. It wasn't bad but it wasn't too special."}
{"text":"Maybe I just haven't been to a lot of AYCE joints, but contrary to other reviewers here, I found the selection to be quite different. Great appetizer bar and consistently well prepared dishes.   Raw fish quality was on par with others (which is to say average), and nothing stood out to be bad, except for the \"torched sushi\" which sounds like a great novelty dish, but turned out to have a gassed/butane taste to it and wasn't even close to good."}
{"text":"TLTR: food is average service is bad, can find many other AYCE sushi places in the area that are a lot better.  We reserved for 12 people for Dec. 26 dinner. I'm aware that it is challenging to take care of a group this size, especially during the holidays, but what happened is still unacceptable.   We made the reservation for 7pm, and was promised we will have seats together. We arrived about 6:50pm and was told that they accidentally gave out our table to another group with reservation at 7:15 because they didn't check the reservation details. We were told to wait for tables to open up despite of the other group only just seated and no food was served at the time. Then they ask if we are willing to split up, if not, it's 20 min wait. We wanted to sit together so decided to wait. No surprise 20min wait became 30min, then 40min. We got the table and sent in our first order at 7:50.  We were told we will get 10% off because of their mistake, but if only we all pay cash. In addition, we found out that they raised the price from 29.99 to 32.99 two weeks ago, which is not posted anywhere. Drink is included, but only soft drinks. Juice is extra.  Food came very slow, and sashimi orders are always short. We ordered 50 salmon sashimi (we are big group), we only got 20. This is one of the key factors when I evaluate an AYCE restaurant. Same with our orders of other sashimi items. Some other hot food orders (relatively less costly ones) came relatively fast and in huge portion......  The taste of the food is very average.  Also, last call was around 9:30, very early, especially considering we only started at 8pm and the food came really slow."}
{"text":"Food is good, however service is the worst we have ever received.  We arrived at 530 on Saturday Nov 25th. 4 adults with a baby.   They kicked us out at 7 while we were still eating, and one server with glasses told us: \"Are you guys ok?.  We have a long lineup and we have a seating limit (what does that even means?) You can order the last round.\"  ( Notice.  He didn't even apologize to it)     And by 718 we were out.  Funny thing was, the table with 5 adults at the next table who arrived earlier than us didn't receive such treatment.     I have been a Yelp user but I never post anything.  But the experience this time really got me.  For that.  We will never go back no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Pros - Sushi was pretty good - Food was tasty - Quick and efficient service - Lunch buffet was regularly priced ($18 for a Saturday lunch if I recall correctly)  Cons - Utensils were a bit dirty... as was the environment..."}
{"text":"The worst sushi ayce experience I ever had with my family and dad's business partners..   Waitresses were rude..   The sushi tasted BAD!   You have to get up and get your on soup.. People don't close the lids on the pot.. Bowls are dirty and forks are everywhere.. It's a shitshow.."}
{"text":"Food was decent..but service was so bad. It was a busy night and for some reason only 3 servers...ALL of our empty plates and dishes were left on the table and never removed..I asked the wait or twice to clear the table and nothing.  The washrooms were DISGUSTING beyond disgusting.  Paper towels over flowing, toilets dirty, no paper towel refills...it made me lose my appetite. Dishes and cups did not seem to be clean also. For the price we paid it was not worth it. Never coming back again.  Please learn to manage and have more staff ready to serve....very very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"My new fave AYCE sushi place!   Me and my gf always go on sushi dates and like to try new sushi spots. Ayce on days we're reeeally feeling for some sushi  Ayce is a hit or miss, most of the time a miss.  We both absolutely loved our experience the moment we came in. Decor is very nice and clean, must be newly renovated. There's a salad/dessert bar, where u can self serve ur own seaweed salad (which i always must have)! The great thing about this place is they have some items on their menu that other places don't -- such as their special torched unagi sushi which was my fave.   Another key aspect in an Ayce is RICE. Majority Ayce sushi places put way too much rice! In the sushi especially, like it's their ploy to fill u up with rice before ordering more. I usually end up with a snowball of rice on my plate that Ive picked off. The nigiri sushi here is a tad smaller than the traditional size but is perfect for ayce! Good rice to fish ratio.   Aside from the sushi, the cooked items were yummy as well. Bacon wrapped asparagus, and can't go wrong with the beef enoki roll :)   There's a lot on the menu that I still need to try! Wasn't able to try everything in one sitting so definitely coming back! :) would recommend this place to all my friends  I would also like to make a special mention to our server Mabel who was very attentive and always made sure we had what we needed! :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food very much, a little over priced for the weekends but overall a good experience.   The torches sushi was amazing. They have lamb which a lot of places do not offer. The have Ipads for ordering which makes everyone's life extremely easy."}
{"text":"Made a reservation the day before the Saturday. We showed up at 7:00 and ended up waiting 45 minutes... Place needs to get their customer service and managing in order. Reservations aren't supposed to be first show first serve based on reservation. A women made a reservation 2 hours before 7 and got seated before us. Seriously? Why would you let people sit knowing that others are coming. You might as well eliminate the whole reservation thing if you're not going to be right or learn not let available reserve at 7.  They compensated us with soft drinks... Okay... Thanks. It's a good gesture compared to other Asian restaurants who would have argued but still a disappointment."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dinner at Ichiban today. Everything tasted pretty good and I liked the fact that you could get up and get your own soup, salad and dessert. I felt like all of the sashimi was pretty fresh.   For an AYCE restaurant, I was impressed with the service. Firstly, you order using an iPad so you can refer to what you ordered when the waiter comes and checks in on how everything is going and whether you're receiving the items you ordered. Yes, you read that correctly. Someone actually comes and checks to see how the service is and whether you're receiving your dishes. I've never experienced that at an AYCE before! If you tell them you're missing a dish, they bring it out pretty promptly, which was another check mark in my books.  So service was efficient and friendly.   I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located on Kennedy Rd. and Steeles Ave E inside Splendid China Tower. The parking lot was surprisingly full because  still found a parking spot a little further away from the entrance.   [SERVICE] - 4/5 We ordered items via an iPad, and the food arrived pretty quickly. Servers cleared our tables pretty quickly after we finished each item. They also checked up on us quite often.   [DÉCOR] - 3/5  Lots of seats, but booth beside the main entrance was quite cold because the air vents in the ceiling blew cold air in our faces.  [QUALITY] - 2/5 Slightly below average quality for an AYCE sushi restaurant. Fish did not taste extremely fresh but more of a muted seafood flavour.   [ORDER] - 2/5 - Weekend AYCE Lunch - $18.99 (Free soft drink & refills): variety of food was not that large on their lunch menu. The best item was definitely the Salmon Rose! Other than that, they only have a basic selection of sushi and cooked items.  [OVERALL] - 2/5 I think the price is okay because you can order a soft drink with refills. But overall, there are better places for AYCE sushi in the GTA with more variety of sushi, sushi rolls, and cooked items from the kitchen."}

{"text":"Food overall: 3 stars My boyfriend was really excited to try this place after seeing their menu. It seemed like they had many novelty items that aren't common at most ayce sushi restaurants. However, we both agreed that Ichiban fell short of our expectations.  I didn't like the herbal sauce that accompanied the beef tataki. It might have been OK if the beef wasn't soaked in the sauce, but it was too much and tasted too tangy and in a weird way.  I didn't really try any of their soups or salads since they didn't seem all that appealing.  If there's one thing that you must try, it's the lamb rack. It was very tender, juicy, and slightly gamey. The sushi and sashimi were okay. The ebi sashimi had absolutely no taste, which was odd.  The mango yogurt, mango pudding, and mango sago were very good, a little sweet as expected, but good.  They had this grass jelly with coconut milk desert that sounded and looked enticing but actually had no taste.  Pistachio soft serve basically tasted like cherry ice cream.  Ambiance: 3 stars Pretty nice and modern interior decor. A little dimmer than I would have preferred it. Moderately loud restaurant on a Friday evening.   Service: 3 stars All our items arrived in a timely manner. Our waiter was nice enough to come over periodically to make sure we got everything we ordered on the Ipad."}
{"text":"For an AYCE, I have to admit that I was pretty impressed.  We had a very bad first impression of this place before so I thought we'd never come back to give it a try. Thank god we decided to give them a chance!  The first time we came, they had the Sushibits promo and I was super excited to try it out. Yeah I know .. it's just a sushi rolled into a ball form. The waitress told us we couldn't order that and walked away, no explanation whatsoever. So we waved down another waiter and asked him and he said there was no more because there's only a limited amount every day. My bf got pissed off because well.. how could you really run out? It's literally just a ball of rice with a piece of fish on top. If they had sushi and sashimi, there's no way they can really \"run out\". Well that was it. I thought ok..the bf hates this place. I guess we won't ever come back again....  I was wrong! We came here with 3 other friends one night and wooow! I loved the Torched Salmon Sushi, Torched White Tuna Sushi, and their special sushis (forget what they were called!). They have an area in the back where you can get your own salads, soups, and a few selection of desserts. This I really liked because I was able to control the quantity of salad or soup I wanted. Sometimes I only want a sip or two of soup!   The sushi was smaller than your usual AYCE sushi places which was perfectly fine and just the way we preferred it. They didn't try to stuff everything with a lot of rice so we were able to eat more and enjoy the different variety of food."}
{"text":"Pretty standard ayce sushi experience. Good amount of selection. They have a soup, salad, and dessert bar. Slushie shots. Not a very typical thing for an Asian restaurant to do, but for birthdays, all servers come out to celebrate with you. You make all your orders on an electronic device which is nice for you to keep track of everything you ordered.  To get to ichiban, there's a smaller entrance to the right of the big main entrance. Just walk in that entrance and head straight to the back and it will be in the right."}
{"text":"Ordered:  -tourched duck sushi -edamame beans -bacon enoki mushroom roll -tourched fuji roll -lamb racks  Expectation -fast service -variety -flavor  Reality You know how some \"all you can eat\" places dont give you all the food you order. Well I can tell you from my experience, it all came FAST. But the problems wasnt with the service but the food itself. There was some hits and misses; one of my favorite was the tourched duck sushi. Ive never seen a place in toronto who did this.very nice bold flavours with great a great touch of mayo. Bacon enoki muahrooms were bomb too and I really liked their selection of cold treats in front of the sushi bar.  Moving on to my dislikes; I really didnt enjoy most of their sushi rolls mostly because of the flavour profile. The tablet that you seclect your itemes, most of the food doesnt have a description and so ordering blind until it arrives. Although I really do like a good rack of lamb, this one had strange flavours with none of it being good. Overall experience was ok."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and a friend on a Saturday night for dinner.   Service was good with the waitresses always coming by to clear your empty plates.  Their self serve salad and dessert bar was convenient because you can pack as much as you want on your dish.   The sushi was alright but nothing special in comparison to other ayce sushi places.   One thing that stood out for us was the single pieces of the rack of lamb.   It was crazy tender and very well seasoned.  I would probably go back just to eat that alone."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend.    iPad ordering system is a plus.  Food quality are not too good.  Most of the grilled dishes are very salty and Sushi are just very poorly prepared.  Pops are included.  Price are consider high because the foods are just below average ayce.  2 stars are for the iPad & the Pops. I would not re-visit."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday lunch. Their weekday lunch menu did not seem as big as some of the other AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to - however I was totally fine with it. The food was good, the plates and utensils all matched, the restaurant itself had good decor and atmosphere. Some of the employees were more pleasant than I've experienced at other AYCE sushi restaurants. They have a mini buffet section that you can get up and go to yourself. They had seaweed salad, mango salad, and jellyfish. They also had a few soups. In addition, some of their desserts were up there too (such as the pudding etc).  I would definitely come back, although I don't think I could or want to  fork out $25 for a weekend dinner, I will definitely come back during the cheaper times. Keep in mind they do have more selection when it is the weekend or dinner etc (hence the price).  Also I do like their portions, particularly the noodle portions. Some places serve so much, it's enough for two people - this place doesn't serve too much so you can have room for other things."}
{"text":"// 100th Review //   I've been saving my 100th review (and first review of 2017), but it's made me realize that I haven't written anything in four months.   Anyway, this review is long overdue. I came here near the end of January (to celebrate someone's birthday). It was my second time coming (first time with another group). Both occasions were during the lunch AYCE. I can't remember the exact price, but it was very fair considering it was AYCE.   Service was friendly. After getting seated (there weren't too many people, so we got seats quickly), a waiter let us know that they had a salad/dessert bar in the back if we wanted anything. They were always very quick when we flagged them down, and orders came fairly quickly.  The food itself was standard for an AYCE place. There's a lot of variety here. Typical sushi dishes, but also many stir fried foods/other items. At other restaurants, I usually find that lunch options can be quite limited compared to their dinner options, but I found that there was a very good balance here. I was able to try many of their dishes.  I would give this place a 3.5, but since Yelp doesn't have half-stars, I'll bump it up to a 4. I would definitely return. The only downfall of this location is that the plaza it's in is not very populated. Being across from Pacific Mall, getting there itself is a bit haphazard. The only crosswalks are at Kennedy/Steeles and Old Kennedy/Steeles, so you'll likely have to jaywalk if you're on foot."}
{"text":"Maybe they are just starting out but the service is no good. Super slow. Very unorganized. And they constantly speak mandarin to me when I don't speak it.  Pieces of the sushi are tiny. Good for ayce. Def not good for ala carte. I left hungry.  The price for ayce is pretty high for the menu.  I much rather go to other ayce restaurants with a bigger menu."}
{"text":"So...I used to enjoy this restaurant up until my most recenr visit. Upon paying the bill, the  server automatically assumed we didnt want change and said \"Thank you have a nice day\" and then we answered no we want change back. The server then gave us a lecture that we have to pay tip and blah blah blah. I believe it's at the customers discretion on if and how much tip they want to pay (regardless if the service was good or not). The amount of tip left should NOT be the servers decision to simply just take. Upon many previous occasions, it seems that the servers are trained NOT to return change so the customers forget and just leave. If you want change back you have to ASK for it. Return of change should just be given unless the customers specifically says no change required. On a separate note, it seems the servers of this restaurant are not LGBT friendly as they always snicker and laugh amongst themselves in their language as they stare at us. They also dont replenish the dessert bar often as I wanted the coconut dessert and they had them when I first got there and there was none left when I was leaving. I will NOT be returning here ever, so whomever does enjoy this place, you can have my VIP card and get 10% off for the  months remaining since we wont be using it."}
{"text":"Ichiban All You Can Eat was such a good experience! Food was amazing, service was fast and servers were nice. There was a HUGE variety in the menu, none like I've ever seen before. There was also torched sushi, which is uncommon at most places. Not only did they have Japanese cuisine, they had curry, fried rice, lamb chops and so much more. Soda was also included so t was nice not having to pay extra for fountain drinks. Appetizers and some dessert were placed in an area where you can just go to get if you were hungry and didn't want to wait. Overall, a very good AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant on the advice of a friend who works in Scarborough. I quite enjoyed my meal. I enjoyed the salad bar and the sushi. The torched sushi was excellent. The beef tataki was very good and the white tuna tataki was the best that I have ever had.   My only reservation is that the I-pad menu is not as easy to use as the I-pad menus used by other AYCE restaurants.  I had a 4.5 star experience but rounded it up because I disagree with some of the more negative revues."}
{"text":"The food here is below average. We kept getting items we didn't order and didn't get some of the things we actually did order. Would not recommend this place."}
