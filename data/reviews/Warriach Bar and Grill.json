{"text":"Absolutely horrible. They charge premium prices for less than average food. Fancy place with low quality food. Got the butterchicken was uncooked and had no flavour. Got the chat papri was drenched in there green spicey sauce and unbalanced with the seasonings. Save yourself the trouble and never come here. Want good upscale indian food go to avani in mississauga, this place is just another crap indian food place. Lived in Brampton for over fifteen years never had such low quality indian food for such a high price. You definitly dont get what you paid for here. Also the person bellow is a lier how I know this is bc we told them everythibg that was wrong with the food and they just laughed about it."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian meals we've had in a very long time.  Their lamb chops were sublime; so tender and grilled to perfection.  Their grilled fish was also well marinated and absolutely amazing.  With the tandoori naan and the raita, it made for delicious meal. The decor is understated and tasteful.  The servers were polite and well trained.  A \"must try\" if you enjoy good Indian food!"}
{"text":"Was a nice surprise to find this little gem. Coming to Toronto we seem to stick with the same resto but this time we tried something new. Photos pretty much sums it up. The grill platters were awesome both meat and seafood. And loved their nans.  Nice ambience great service,"}
