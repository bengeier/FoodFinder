{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Curry Goat  Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 2.5 / 5 Cooking/Microwaving speed: 2.5 / 5  Food Quality: 1 / 5 Food Quantity: 2 / 5 Price: 1 / 5 Cleanness: 2 / 5 Repeat: Only if I am an uncover office looking for a bust  I saw the restaurant featured in the Toronto edition of Million Dollar critic. So I got interested to try it out ......  If the restaurant wouldn't cook fresh food for the Million Dollar Critic, I seriously doubt I would get anything fresh. But I did not expect the curry goat would be frozen solid when the server scooped it out. After he microwaved it, it turned into a puddle of curry liquid (it did not look or taste like any sauce). Save yourself the trouble and get a decent Curry Goat at Sunrise at Yonge and College. In addition, it's quite expensive for the food at such a dive.  While I was eating, I witness a drug deal happening right in front of the church. If you are an uncover office looking for a bust, this would be the perfect place for you.  The producer who selected this restaurant for the Million Dollar Critic, what were you thinking!?"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I will start off by saying that. :)  The service is OK but Mr. Butt can be forgetful at times lol. On several occasions I have ordered sides or dishes and he forgot to put them in my take-out bag. I actually called on one occasion to remind him that he had forgotten my naan and samosas. I walked back for it and when I got home I realized that he'd only given me my naan and he forgot my samosas again lol. A lost cause at that point... but the dishes I did have were amazing and I'm never disappointed when I try something new.  I wish they would cook with less fat though.. there tends to be a half inch of oil floating on top of the food before he scoops it out. I guess that goes with the nature of take-out but his food is so tasty it doesn't need all that fat.   His desserts are pretty good too :) he's very patient and nice.. but forgetful lol just make sure all your items are in your bag before you leave ahah..  Definitely recommend for something a little different."}
{"text":"I wish Chris Nutall-Smith (Globe and Mail) hadn't reviewed this before I got there because now I owe all the glory for finding it to him.  I passed it everyday on the way to work, but the neighbourhood isn't squeaky clean like almost all of the downtown is now and it looks like a bit of a dive.  It's great though! I'm glad I ordered medium instead of spicy (I should probably mention that I'm pretty white, if it wasn't already obvious). They give you two huge naan and show cricket on TV."}
{"text":"Good Day, thank you for reading my post. This is a fantastic restaurant! The food choices are excellent and the staff is exceptional.  The food is extremely fresh with a large menu.  It was difficult to decide what to eat! The price point is fantastic!  This coupled with fantastic service, you should be get in line to enjoy the \"repas\"! You will not be disappointed!  I look forward to seeing you in line!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. I like the butter chicken combo, which comes with naan bread, a small salad, and a soft drink. They have a bunch of other great options too.  I think that this place must be a well kept secret. Which makes sense because when you go in there is nothing incredibly impressive about the look of the place and everything gets warmed up in the microwave. And yet... It is just so delicious!   It is a bit expensive compared with other options in the area but outside of that this is one of the best pick-up places in the area. I recommend it for anyone nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious food, likely the best quick pakistani food place in Toronto.  Reasonably priced.  Lots of variety.  I have not dined in, but always done takeout from this place."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Indian food I've ever had in Toronto  you absolutely must try their butter chicken"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a chance but I'm sorry, I have to agree with previous negative reviews. Overpriced for the quality you get. Why call it a paneer item if you only give me one cube of paneer? Sad :("}
{"text":"I came here tonight. Great service. Ordered garlic naan and butter chicken. The food in the buffet style display is cold so they ask you if you would like to heat it up. The naan is freshly made. I found it to be a tad pricy for my liking. Came up to $15 without a drink and just one naan. I regretted only getting one. The actual garlic naan itself was interesting.. not what I'm used to. Had a lot of herbs on it as you can see from my pic. It wasn't my favourite naan but it was good once I dipped it in the butter chicken. The butter chicken was good by the way. Just didn't like the green garnish on top. Next time I will try the mango shake if I come back. (As they do not have mango lassi). Overall decent late night spot, good portion and service."}
{"text":"After leaving the office late, I wanted delicious take-out to go home. Stopped by this place on my way home and noticed it was open until 6am! And the selection of dishes with different spices, sauces, veggies and meats was amazing!   When ordering, I asked for mild choices, and the owner let me try five different dishes :) Here's the thing: the food was not heated up, and because he used a styrofoam plate, I did not want it heated. At home, we noticed the meat was perhaps not fully cooked... the one-minute heat-up in the microwave was not enough... the texture of the chicken was slightly raw... it probably needed some time stove-top to fully cook the meat. As well, when the food is served warm (as opposed to tasting it cold), the spices are very hot! I ended up spending part of the night awake with stomach pains and having to take antacids. The next day was better, as I fully cooked what was left over and ate it with plain yogourt to tone down the spices.  Of note: there are no side-dish prices on the board in the restaurant, so you need to check a take-out menu. I only wanted the dish, no rice, no drink. However, I think that four small containers (two veggie, two meat) for $37 was a surprise; I wonder if I was charged the combo price. Either that, or the containers are bigger than they look. The owner asked me if I would like naan bread, made fresh, that he had available immediately, to which I said sure, but that ended up taking about seven minutes to prepare.  In all, I would say this is a good place, and I may return, but I would be more careful next time about what I order. Some dishes are very strong, with whole spices, as opposed to powdered, and quite spicy. I would also ask if the meat is fully cooked when getting take-out."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places when I am in the mood for Indian/Pakistani cuisine. Almost an exact copy of King Palace on Bloor, this place offers the same wealth of options at similarly good prices.   Dishes I would recommend: -any of the 3 meat curry combos with naan -biryani -tandoori chicken -kebabs -kulfi (to cool your tummy down after the meal)"}
{"text":"Great place for Pakistani food. Run by Mr Butt and Co, all the food here is delicious. I had the kashmiri chicken and the haleem (lentil and ground beef) with two naan. It was $12 including a drink and salad. So good. Everything was fresh tasting.  A little hole in the wall spot but service was very good and the place is well maintained."}
{"text":"Just ordered chicken masala combo and it's very delicious! It is pretty spicy but I love it. It's also great portion and comes with a side of salad and a can of soda which is pretty decent deal in this area."}
{"text":"Value food that's really yummy. Makes me miss home. Wish there was more spice in the haleem. Also when you have parathas mentioned on your menu you should really serve them :/"}
{"text":"The food is really good!  It's not exactly the kind of atmosphere you'd take a new friend or date, but as the new rival to King Palace, this place offers some great competition. The food is really delicious and the prices are average for Pakistani/Indian food.   I've only taken food out from there, and even the day after (if it lasts, which it generally doesn't) it's still so yummy. I like that it has options that a lot of desi restaurants don't.   Definitely worth checking if you are nearby."}
{"text":"One late night I was watching an episode of Million Dollar Critic which is a food show hosted by Giles Coren and one of the restaurants he tried was a Pakistani restaurant named King Place. He gave it a thumbs up, so I thought I would try it out. I have passed by the restaurant and never really noticed it because it's probably located in one of the worst neighbourhoods in the city but guess what, the food is authentic and pretty good.  So I decided on the beef nihari ($10.99 plus tax) which is essentially slow cooked beef and one of the national dishes of Pakistan. The combo came with beef nihari, a salad, pop and two butter naan breads. The beef nihari was tender and delicious and the the sauce was rich and vibrant with all the variety of spices used ranging from cardamon, cinnamon and a few others. It was spicy but not too spicy at least for me. The freshly made butter naan bread was delicious. I also ordered a combo of beef nihari with rice ($10.99 plus tax) to go for my close friend who is Pakistani to see what he thought. He gave it the thumbs up and mentioned it was close to what he has had back home.  If you are looking for good authentic Pakistani fare at a reasonable price, definitely give this place a shot. It's not in the best neighbourhood in the city and the restaurant decor is nothing to write home about but the food is pretty good and it's authentic Pakistani cuisine."}
{"text":"Crazy. Fresh, flavourful and cheap. I love that places like this can still exist in Toronto. Found through uber eats and would be in all the time if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner before a show.  So much to choose from, but as it was our first time here we went with recommended dishes.  The Chana Masala and Beef Nihari.  Delicious, the naan was light, fluffy and really yummy.  Excellent for a quick bite or to take out.  Not much to like in the area, but it's the city."}
{"text":"So like the other people try to say, its a very working class neighborhood.   Food is presented very good, looks delicious. The restaurant looks clean. A nice guy is out front and it sounds like another in the back cooking your naan. You choose your dish and they heat it up in the microwave.  I had a great tasting chicken dish the actual chicken was the poorest quality parts of the chicken with very little chicken mostly bone. Not my favorite experience with the bones with next to no meat.  I had Garlic Naan, it was soaked in oil. Did not like it.   So on the price.... it was very expensive... had a large size which is small... and the naan and a can of pop and it was $18 dollars.... way too much. I was hungry when I bought it and since I could not eat the naan (it was dripping in oil) I was still hungry when done."}
{"text":"This place has without a doubt the most authentic Indian food in Toronto. I've been to India and this place has what I've had there beat. The chicken tikka masala is amazing but it for people who don't like it hot. The butter chicken is much milder.  I haven't had any of the Pakistani food but it looked just as great.  This place is better for take out or delivery as the restaurant is a whole in the wall and not in the best neighbourhood. This place is on UberEATS so avoid the restaurant's area and enjoy the food at home.   From what I have heard, this place is a spinoff King's Palace up on Church and Yonge. The food is similar and the layout and decor is similar."}
{"text":"So I'm sure everyone knows the whole story. Mr Butt used to be a partner and split to start his own restaurant away from the original King Place. I stick to the classic - Butter Chicken Combo which is delicious!!  Not the highest quality by any means but delicious. The food here is definitely better than the original King Palace but it might not be worth dealing with the crackheads that are constantly hanging out near here. I was walking towards the restaurant and got cornered by a couple of crackheads and almost bullied into giving them money. Definitely not worth it. I really hope Mr Butt relocates because the food is sooooo good.  4 stars instead of 5 because of all the crackheads."}
{"text":"Saw this place near our badminton place and decided to check it out. After we went in - the first impression was not good. They were a few tables where the customers ate and left and the tables were not cleaned up.  We then proceeded to order. They did have a good selection of food and they were all on display - kinda like fast food style. I ordered the Kashmiri chicken. Came with two Naan and I decided to substitute rice with it.  The food was so so. Was good but nothing special. For the price $11.99 probably not worth it as as there are other Indian restaurants you can go to that can provide you better food for the price."}
{"text":"Not fresh at all, everything was old. Paneer dish didn't have Paneer in it. Chicken Biryani was oily, no chicken breast, a little funny tasting, and old. Chicken manchurian was all dark meat, old, and not anything tasty. Blah.. I would not order again. My recommendation is for them to use fresher ingredients, cook fresh (plenty of places are able to do fresh buffet style serving on the cheap), and please provide options for white meat.   I was so looking forward to some desi food tonight."}
{"text":"So I came to this rather strip-mall looking restaurant on the encouragement of the Globe and Mail article that sang its praises.  Indeed, I was not disappointed, whatsoever.    The FOOD:  The channa masala, the staple Pakistani/Indian dish that is often so boring was absolutely excellently executed here.  Great depth of flavour with a lovely amount of heat.  If you don't like things at least \"white people medium\" to \"white people spicy\" you should probably just look elsewhere...if you like spice, you'll be satisfied here.    We also had the beef nihari which was incredibly tender and flavourful.  I got hints of cardamom and citrus as well as heat.  Really quite well done.  I was shocked how much I liked the food given that it's displayed junior high cafeteria style and heated by a microwave--somehow it still works.  The combos are all served with fresh naan.  The DRINKS:  Soft drinks and a rather sad mango lassi.  The lassi is a pass I'm afraid...made too far in advance and chalky tasting.  No alcohol to be found here.  The SERVICE:  For a super casual place like this, I was surprised how friendly the service was.  We were warmly welcomed by a friendly staff member who insisted on letting us sit down while he brought things out to us one at a time.     OVERALL, I would say it's definitely worth the walk down what is perhaps the dodgiest section of Sherbourne for this excellent Pakistani food.  The combos with tax tend to clock in around $10-ish.  BTW: If you like cricket, it's on the TV here."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS and I am genuinely impressed. Got chicken biryani and chicken karahi with naan to test the place out. So far it is pretty good. Will for sure try more dishes."}
{"text":"I had recently moved into the area and started getting food here on a regular basis. When I ordered during the day and requested for the combo meal but no drink, I was always given salad with it and I would get $1.00 discount since I did not get a drink. When I ordered the same thing in the evening, the guy tried to rip me off and told me that the salad was not included. Overall terrible customer service. I guess they don't need the walk-in traffic since they are overcharging people on ubereats and they have many orders from there. It's a real shame that some restaurants don't know how to gain and maintain customers for the long term. Like how much could a measly salad have cost them really. Terrible experience, there are much better indian take-out food in the area."}
{"text":"Great Indian food for a good price! Be sure to ask for help if you're not sure about a dish, especially since some of the chicken dishes can be spicy! Nice variety of dishes. Fresh Naan is also a plus."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Pakistani food - great flavours, perfect for late night and taxi stops."}
{"text":"I wish I can give half stars--as I write this review I am toying with 3 or 4... I was introduced to this place by an Uber driver whom I had asked to be taken to grab something quick before going home after work (after working a long long day) at midnight.  He suggested King Place and adamantly insisted I ordered the Tikka Masala Chicken (hot)--I ended up ordering three items, 1 meat and two veggie on plain rice for $13.99 (pop included as well).  They have a large selection of curries, meats all displayed buffet style (but it is not self serve).  I ordered the Tikka Masala Chicken, Chana Masala and Alii Golbi on plain rice, ginger ale and desert, rasmalai.  Rasmalai is not very commonly found so I was super happy to have been able to order it.  Probably one of my favorite desserts, Ras Malai is dumplings made from cottage or riccotta cheese soaked in sweetened, thickened milk delicately flavored with cardamom. Serve it chilled and garnished with slivers of dried fruit.  The food was good and portion was large--I ordered take out so you can either have it cold or heated up.  I opted for cold since I was taking it home.  Where the lack of a star comes in is because of the patrons that surrounds the area.  Under influences I was approached twice and I was safe but it did scare me enough to not likely visit.  I was told they are on UberEats so is another option."}
{"text":"This is the kind of Indian restaurant I love. Just good hearty quality Indian food. Better than many fancy Indian restaurants I've had in London uk"}
{"text":"Not the neigjbrhood u might pick for a date but if u are down there the food is very tasty. Authentic and confrmed by tons of taxi drivers there. Eaten several dishes - portions large and lots of flavour. Very casual and open til 5am."}
{"text":"My friend used to cook delicious  indian meals for me, but sadly she moved back to India.  So when my friend suggested this place, i was really looking forward to eating Indian food again.  When i entered the restaurant,  i saw lots of empty tables with piles of dirty dishes still yet to be cleaned up.  Then i proceeded to the counter where they displayed all their foods in buffet style.  There were many to choose from.  Also all around the walls there were lots of picture menus to browse through.  I ended up choosing a chicken kebab meal.  It came with 2 skewers, salad, and naan bread.  The kebabs were dry, and the salad looked sad in its wilting state.  The naan bread was ok.   It really was not the most inspiring meal i ever had."}
{"text":"OMG AMAZING and delicious!  The owner works right in the store- you pick what you want, and you have a choice to have it heated or take away to heat at home.  *this is brilliant because the sauces are just thick enough not to spill in the container*.  When you heat it up the sauces become plentiful and delightfully delicious.    Great value, great portions. Fresh Naan, and very friendly service.  I will bike here from Spadina and Lakeshore just for the all-round awesomeness that it is."}
