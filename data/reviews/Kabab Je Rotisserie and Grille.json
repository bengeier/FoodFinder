{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Always fresh and delightful, and the same at both locations. From the Cauliflower or Falafel to the Hummus Shawarma, Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"By far Kabab Je is our favorite restaurant.  It is our go to place for lunch every Sunday.  The food is always fresh. The portions are generous and hot pita bread is addictive. The staff adds to the entire experience. They are friendly and attentive and go out their way to make sure we are satisfied with our meal."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 4.5, I would! Very generous  Chicken Kabab, excellent Tahini, great spicy potatoes and very fresh bread. It can get a little loud, but only because it's a small space with a lot of happy customers! I have two suggested options for sides that may accompany entrees: 1) a rice option without raisins 2) a small salad portion. The garlic sauce was extremely strong to me -- and may be to your date, too... But the Tahini Sauce is great!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place. Friendly service. Nice music. A little tight seating, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I really love coming to this place! My husband and I die in here at least once a month. Today we came for lunch. We usually get the same items every time period I always get the grilled chicken. I cannot say enough about the chicken at this place. It is so savory and tasty. I cannot even begin to explain how good it actually is. The grill chicken comes with rice and vegetables. The portion sizes are few mungas. Plenty for you to have as a meal while you're at the restaurant and then to bring leftovers home! My husband always gets the mixed grill. This I believe has several different types of meat and also comes with rice in vegetables. They have drink selections but they mostly come out of a can or a bottle. I usually just get water. As an appetizer I suggest the stuffed grape leaves. They are served warm. I believe they give you 5 or 6 of them in they are pretty big. There is a place to dine outside should you want to do that period we dined outside today but usually dine inside at night. Over all this is our go to place for mediterranean food. The service is always wonderful in the food comes out very quickly. If you want a reasonably priced a meal that is going to fill up your belly this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is the best meal out I've had in while!!   Absolutely everything was delicious.  We got shawarma, lamb kebobs, roasted cauliflower and fresh hummus.  It was the perfect meal and such a great low carb option which can be so hard to find.  This is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to see a new location, closer to home, of one of our favorite restaurants.  We had lunch on a Friday, arriving just after opening to beat the crowds.  It seems like they are still working out the kinks as service was less than we usually see at the original location.  The food was pretty good.  My wife loved the lentil soup, just as good as usual.  My shawarma wrap was ok, more on how it was made than the actual food.  They put too much sauce which completely soaked through the pita.  After eating half of it, I had to stop because of how messy it was becoming.  The taste was still good, but the texture was off.  Our falafel was delicious as usual.  The owner was there and walking through during the meal.  With his attention they should get things up to the standard of the other location pretty quick.  We will give them another shot after Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"I've tried this location twice now. The first time I had the lamb shank which was good but needed a lot of salt. It seemed like there was no salt at all in it. Hubby had the chicken kebab which was dry! As an appetizer we had the batata hara which were very browned but undercooked which I thought was weird. We also had the sojouk that again needed salt but was good anyway! Second time I started with the kibbeh and eggplant el rahib that were both delicious! I had the meat showrma which was just ok. Hubby had the kish kash which was basically regular mixed lamb kafta grilled with a tomato sauce over it! I suspect it's the same sauce they use for the lamb. Quite disappointing! A friend had the grilled chicken that I tried and was really good. Flavorful and moist!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal tonight at Kabab-Je.  Ordered several appetizers and shared.  The chicken soup is to die for.  Loved the hummus and fresh hot pits breads.  We try something new every visit."}
{"text":"Wow!  I don't know what else to say. This place has some of the best middle eastern food I have had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Authentic Lebanese home cooking here in Charlotte. Great that they opened a new location. Come early....the restaurant is a now an open secret and you will see the devoted line up and wait for seating. The servers are fast, caring and friendly. Generous portions and worth every penny. Great for the health conscious!"}
{"text":"great food reasonable prices caring staff authentic lebanese food delicous deserts"}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the musaka and the cauliflower app as well as the chicken skewer. The rice was dry and not tasty and that's why it gets 4 of 5 stars. I can live with dry rice because everything else was very tasty!"}
{"text":"So much was right about my experience at this restaurant, that it pains me to just give it three stars. The service was perfect, the Fattoush salad was large and amazing. Then the mixed grill of chicken, lamb and beef came...Sigh.......it was SO DRY! Very large portions, tasty rice but the meats were all dry. We had dinner at 7:30 so I don't know if you need to come earlier to get more \"moist\" meat? I definitely plan to give it another try, but probably during lunch. On a side note: I have been to their other restaurant several times and it has always been excellent."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here.  We had popped in last week after the movies but they were closing in ten minutes so we decided to give it a try when we had more time.  Let me start by saying, WOW.  I enjoy Mediterranean food immensely and have had it in many restaurants and Kabob-Je did not disappoint.  We were warmly greeted and sat quickly.  We went over the menu.  I admit, I had anticipated eating here so I had looked at their menu online earlier. We started with the Hummus and Falafel appetizers.  They came out very fast.  They both were served with a large, freshly baked piece of pita.  The falafel was very good and the menu claimed it to be vegan which is good to know.  It was served with many accompaniments; tahini, lettuce, diced tomato, diced radish, fresh parsley and mint leaves.  The Hummus was probably the best I have ever had.  It was extremely smooth and creamy.  Without asking our server brought us more freshly baked pita. It was so fresh it was still pillowed with steam!  Our entrees came next. My partner ordered the Shrimp Kabobs and I had the Scallop Kabobs. Both were served with generous portions of grilled vegetables (squash, zucchini, onion) and yellow basmati rice topped with dried fruit. It was a sensational meal, some of which we brought home to finish later.  I watched the other tables to see what other dishes looked enticing.  I will follow up this post with another detailing our next visit, which if I have my way will be soon!"}
{"text":"The Fried Cauliflower was tasteless other than the over-tart Tahini sauce. The Musakaa was decent. And the Meat Shawarma Sandwich was not good at all. The meat was so dry and tough that is was almost like eating jerky."}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch place. The service was a tad slow and non reactive, but they are nice and all smile. Food was okay, it didn't blow me away. They served pita with vegetable oil, I thought it was suppose to be olive. When I was ready to leave, it took forever to get the bill. It's an unusual vibe, cool but strange. It has a sit-down and served dinning area, but it also has this fast food come up to counter and order thing to it also. Areas of improvement are there but the restaurant has potential."}
{"text":"It is imperative to state up front that this exceptional Mediterranean restaurant, Kabob Je Rotisserie & Grill, actually replaced the much inferior Kabob Grill that had resided in the same Stonecrest location for several years. Other than the name \"Kabob,\" the two restaurants have nothing in common; in fact, Kabob Je addressed every deficiency of the prior tenant from its lame pita bread to the rude servers. Its Matthews' location had become our favorite restaurant the past couple of years and we are almost giddy about having this second location so near by at Stonecrest Shopping Center.    On this Sunday lunch visit (our first), we were pleased to find a packed dining room with its proud owner, Yasar, happily greeting us and other guests upon entry. His continual involvement and his carefully selected staff make every visit a special event.  You cannot go wrong with anything you choose from the menu and we have tried about everything. Normally however, we split the Mixed Grill Plate at $16 along with a Vegetable Plate at $12. The mixed grill contains one skewer each of lamb, chicken and beef Kafka along with yellow rice with raisins and grilled veggies. It includes a delicious white garlic dipping sauce. The veggie plate contains any four items from a group of about ten. We usually go with the toubolah salad, grape leaves, falafel and hummus, each made fresh in-house by two chefs that specialize in them.  The star of the show however is the incredible, freshly baked pita bread that is served with every meal. It is baked in a conspicuously displayed special brick open and is served piping hot. Desserts, though not made in-house, are also excellent, particularly the salted caramel custard that is so good that it should include a cigarette (even for nonsmokers like me). Hold on a second... I'm getting a little woozy just thinking about it...  Service is consistently superb and sanitation scores are always high. It probably comes as no surprise, that this place is a Gotta Try!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time but things seemed off this time around. Server wasn't very friendly at all. My favorite things on the menu is no longer there anymore (Spinach pies) was never asked if we wanted dessert she just brought us a check while we were half way done with our entrees, never even asked if we were enjoying our meal. With some many other middle eastern places coming up in the area Kebob needs to step their game up."}
{"text":"Wasn't what I expected at all, we ordered food and they brought the hummus , stuffed grape leaves, baba g and fried cauliflower all this was scrumptious and great till we got the main course which was chicken , beef , lamb and kofta kabob non of them meats was edible at all had one half bite of each and couldn't try another bite of the meats, they tasted like eating plastic they had this awful strange after taste. This is regarding food then the ambience was just as bad the wait staff looks like they didn't care just to put it in a nutshell service as bad as the grilled meats. It's a disappointment."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the new location, and it did not disappoint! I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back again. The Kafta kabob is my favorite and a must try!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the top Mediterranean/Lebanese food in South Charlotte! Except for the Matthews location which was always worth the drive and owed and operated by the same person. Chicken or Beef with the aromatic rice and mixed vegetables are a must. The bread and hummus make your mouth happy, don't forget to ask for a drizzle of olive oil on top of the hummus.  Staff are always eager to please and accommodating. Bring your own wine because alcohol is not on the menu.  Not fancy but oh so worth it."}
{"text":"Right now I seem to be obsessed with falafel and Mediterranean food.  And when we were looking for dinner before a movie. I saw a sign for Kabob JE.   The space is a little crammed but we were seated quickly. As you walk in, the aroma of the grill fills the air. And there's a case of kabobs marinating and a pile of fresh homemade pitas back where staff is cooking.   First thing you should know is you get a lot of food with whatever you order. We started off with a falafel plate as an appetizer and it did not disappoint.  It was four large pieces of falafel over a salad served with fresh pita. Their falafel had been my favorite.  Crisp on the outside and flavorful on the inside. It wasn't dry, which is usually my issue with falafel. I was full after this.   I ordered a veggie plate where you get to choose between various items. I got the stuffed grape leaves, smoked eggplant, fattoush and spicy potatoes. The grape leaves were good, but I wish more rice was inside. The smoked eggplant was my least favorite on the plate, but it definitely has a smoky flavor. I spread it more on that delicious pita. The fattoush was good. Veggies were crisp and the toasted pita mixed in great. The potatoes were the star of my meal. Great flavor and addictive.  I have to these again when I come back. My husband's meal was just as good. We both had leftovers.   The only thing we disliked was that sodas were served in bottles verses fountain drinks. We'll both just have water next time.   Amazing food, savory dishes and crisp veggies. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food - amazing flavors - good service - excellent value - appropriate, attentive service.  We were not rushed even though people were waiting in line at the door.  Went early on a Friday night and got there just before the rush, but it was still a bit hectic.  Will for sure go back, but on a  weeknight.  A bit too noisy for us.  Wish they would take over the former Smoke location!"}
{"text":"I give the food a 5 star rating.  My family and I came here for the first time. We got the family platter, it had enough to feed 6 or 7 people! It was amazing and tasty. Such a great deal! The pita bread was delicious, the hummus was perfect. I will recommend this place to anyone visiting the Charlotte or Matthews areas. This was better than a lot of places in Los Angeles. The steak was tender, juicy, and medium rare. The chicken was cooked well and juicy. The kabob was great. The rice was moist.  I give the food a 5 star rating.   The service is what brought it down to a 4 star. I feel kinda bad, but I must be honest. The server was nice, but we all felt uncomfortable with his communication style. He just kept talking to us about the food or how he got hired, etc, but it was not a natural way of speaking as he never stopped. If he would learn to stop being chatty, I would give him a better rating."}
{"text":"This used to be Kabob Grill so not sure what is really different now that it's Kabob Je.  Regardless of the name the food is still Mediterranean and still delish! They served us warm pita bread to start.  Theae were hand tossed and hot iut of the oven; extremely good (5/5). We enjoyed the chicken kabob sandwich and the chicken koofta and they were both good (4/5).  The sandwich chicken was tasty as was the yogurt dressing.  I wish it had lettuce and tomato vs the pickles which were a bit overpowering for me.  The dish was good and the rice had golden raisins and dried cranberries.  The service was excellent as well (5/5).  But the seating is a bit cramped as the tables made you feel you were on top of each other at times (3/5). Overall thou8, very good experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent Lebanese and Mediterranean food . A small restaurant that was fully packed Friday night and we had a 20 minute wait before seated for dinner . The menu features traditional  cold and hot appetizers, salads and entrees especially  kababs of lamb , seafood , chicken ,  salmon, sandwiches  lentil soup side orders like basmati rice and desserts such as baklava and cake . There is also a kids menu available.  They don't serve alcoholic beverages ,  but there is a $10 uncorking fee if you bring your own bottle of wine. My dining mates and I ordered shrimp kebab plate,  chicken kebab plate and the special of the day which was a salmon, shrimp and scallop kebab with a side order of hummus and a Fattoush salad . Food came out hot , plated nicely , large portions and meat and fish very tender. Menu prices reasonable for what you get served. Staff was friendly and attentive . Although, noisy we enjoyed this restaurant very much and will return and try some other menu choices. By the way the hummus was the best I ever had in a long time!"}
{"text":"First time at Kabob Je tonight. A warm, friendly greeting by the staff but my eyes were drawn to the colorful fresh kabobs in a display case! (duh, I didn't take a foto!). Impressive perfection!  The open kitchen looks out over 12 or so 4 tops. Very clean, from menus to s&p shakers, and I'm picky! Lemon & mint w.the water. Yum already. We start with the baba ganoush, which comes with fluffy pillows of fresh pita. Being newly GF, I had cucumber slices, thinking how it's not going to cut it. Well, I couldn't stop eating it & didn't crave the pita! My friends all got different kabob entrees and said it was excellent, very tasty and tender. 2 full skewers of meat that is generously cut. I had the lamb shank entree and altho Tristen (excellent server, btw!) told me their rice is GF, I went with the spicy lemon cubed potatoes. And let me tell you....I'm so happy I have leftovers! The meat was juicy, falling off the bone & was a nice portion. Not over seasoned or over sauced. Grilled vegies were fresh and cooked perfectly. The potatoes were also delicious, which I was very happy about since everyone raves about their cauliflower hot appie which I couldn't have (fried=gluten). What a delightful dining experience all around!  I wrote down the name of this group for Tristen to give the owner, explaining it's not a bashing group & we encourage proprietors to join  I give it a 5 out of 5    Highly recommend the lamb shank! Seriously guys, if you haven't gone .... go!"}
{"text":"I tried it the first time, it was awesome, went in the very next day it tasted exactly the opposite, wonder it was stale food"}
{"text":"Excellent option - location is meah, but staff is amazing and the food is wholesome and satisfying. Their smoked eggplant with smoking pita bread is heavenly"}
{"text":"BEST. MEDITERRANEAN. FOOD. EVER. My mom and I came here for a little lunch and the display cases got us. We ordered what felt like one of everything. We had soooo much food that we're leaving with two bags worth of to-go containers. The desserts are amazing, the smoked eggplant is phenomenal, the falafel is out of this world, and don't get me started on the desserts. This is the best Mediterranean restaurant in Charlotte without a doubt. I've been trying to find a place I can go to for some good food and now that I have found it you won't find me going anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had hummus that tasted the way theirs did since I had it homemade in Key West Florida almost two years ago. I went home and wanted to throw my Sabra in the trash. I'm half tempted to ask if they sell the hummus retail. The entire meal was excellent. But.. just... can we focus back on the hummus please? Y'all. You don't even know if you haven't tried, JUST GO."}
{"text":"Great authentic food but this location-right by the theaters in Stonecrest- is packed on  a Sat. Night at 5:30. We got seated pretty quickly and I don't think they take reservations.   Probably the best hummus I have had in the area. We also all had shawarma and kabob sandwiches.   Wait staff was real friendly and efficient. Family owned, the owner stopped by every table and was genuinely interested in your meal enjoyment.   Huge parking lot. Casual dress."}
{"text":"I don't live in this part of town but was nearby for a work meeting and decided to call ahead and order lunch to go from here. I ordered the lunch special of a shawarma wrap. I wanted a side salad but was told that wasn't an option. The flavors of the shawarma was really good. My issue was how tough the meat was. I was hoping for delicious, tender meat like I've had at some other local spot (shout out to La Shish!) but it was dry and tough. I would go back but I would definitely try something else."}
{"text":"I was hopeful.  Homemade pita was delicious and so were the grape leaves.  We end there.  I ordered a lamb wrap and rice.  The rice was mushy and bland.  My lamb tasted boiled not grilled.  I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly best Mediterranean food in south Charlotte. I am glad they opened this location.  Best things - warm pita cooked continuously. Hummus has great fresh taste. And falafels are to die for.   Can be improved- seating arrangements are little awkward and cramped. And some of the salads can have less citrus flavors.     Overall I recommend having dine-in experience here despite cramped seating due to warm pita.  We tried take out once and those pots are not as fin once packed."}
{"text":"First time at Rea rd location. Our first time at Matthews location was so welcoming and then we never saw our server again. She moved to Rea Rd and what a nice person. Food was great, service was great. Really good lunch."}
{"text":"Wow - the amount of food you get is amazing.  But a large portion is only part of the experience, the food is good.  The amount of people crowding the place on a Wednesday at 1pm goes to show that.    I started with some hummus, which was smooth and tasty.  The bread is awesome, and they will keep bringing it so be careful not to fill up before your sandwich comes.    A word to the wise - if you start with an appetizer, don't bother with a side.  I got the spicy potatoes and they were AMAZING!  I just could eat them all, and still had some of my Kafta Sandwich left.  The Kafta was OK, nothing out of the world, but the sandwich was pretty tasty.  It was a pretty pricey visit for lunch, but I want to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Poor service very average food.  Still looking for a good Lebanese place.  Wish there were better options."}
{"text":"What's better than Kabab Je?  TWO Kabab Je's!!!  The original location in Matthews always has my heart, but the 2nd location in Stonecrest is a great sign that the business is growing and more delicious food will be brought upon Charlotte/Matthews.  The location is off the side of the main Stonecrest \"drag\"... the restaurant front faces Regal Cinemas... I didn't see an outdoor seating area (like Matthews) but it is also winter... so it could just not be set up.  I think they \"inserted this location\" into the space so the dining area has two rows of tables and the kitchen feels like it takes the majority of the space.  A small display case with kabobs will catch your eye as you move your way in... all the smells and the meats rotating in the kitchen makes for a cool ambiance.    The server was super nice and checked in enough... also gave us time to consider the specials.    I was surprised how busy the place was for Friday lunch, but maybe folks were starting their weekends early and playing hooky from work.  Either way... good to see the crowd and lots of people patronizing this place."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place out for so long. We never made it around the building, get side tracked by the pizza spot.   I'm glad we finally tried. Definitely going back for some more delicious food!  Had lentil soup, shawarma beef/lamb entree and all veggies entree. Fed the two of us and our lol toddler. Even the itty bitty liked the food.   Everyone was very nice and helpful."}
