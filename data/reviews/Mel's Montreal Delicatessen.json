{"text":"Mel's is a little bit like a religious pilgrimage to a certain subset of those within stumbling range of the Annex.  It is almost always a feature after a long night of drinking.  Only part of that can be attributed to the fact that they are open 24 hours...I guess the rest is due to their large amounts of greasy, carby, delicious food items which seem tailor made for staving off a hangover.

Every time I have been to Mel's it has been so late it was almost morning, and the place has had a line out the door every time.  The wait can seem unbearable, especially to those a little less than steady on their feet, but the wait is overcome by very speedy table service, which, while it can't exactly be deemed friendly, is certainly efficient.

I have a soft spot in my heart (and probably a hard part in my arteries) for poutine, and the poutine at Mel's can't escape my notice.  It's a rare occasion for me not to get it, because boy is it ever good.  The potatoes taste rich and are always piping hot and have the delicious cheesy-gravy steam wafting off the top.  The good thing about ordering poutine is that everyone at the table will want to trade a bite of it for whatever they're having, and as such I've had an opportunity to try a lot of the other menu items.  

While I'm mostly morally opposed to ordering pancakes at restaurants, I find the ones at Mel's to be quite tasty, and no surprise, big enough to feed dozens of people.  The smoked meat tastes....like smoked meat.  I'm not a big fan of that particular montreal favorite (which is why I get my poutine without it), but from what I've tried before, Mel's is true to form.  Once in a while if my poutine craving is well at bay I will order the regular breakfast special which comes with eggs, toast, bacon, etc, and it is a mighty fine breakfast indeed, especially if you make sure to order coffee and juice too.  It's not far removed from the classic greasy spoon diner type of breakfast, and the price is right, especially for the Annex."}
{"text":"God, I love sandwiches. I love my fancy sandwiches and I love my slap-turkey-on-bread sandwiches. I love sandwiches so much that I call them by their full name - they're worth so much more than \"sammiches\". 

Anyway. Mel's is exactly what a lady needs when she wants a simple deli sandwich. Turkey, dijon, pumpernickel, pickle. As my girl Barefoot Contessa might say, how fabulous is that? Get fries or slaw or soup if you wanna, but I like a just small sandwich (you can get two sizes) and as many pickles as possible.

Dig the old newspaper stories at each table that tell stories of Mel's village-sized family (they adopted a fajillion kids). If you're heading home afterwards, pick up a jar of pickles or even homemade jam. The place isn't fancy and the service isn't amazing, but they've got a patio and the next time you watch that deli scene from When Harry Met Sally and you want a turkey sandwich just like Meg Ryan, this spot will do the trick."}
{"text":"Any place that can be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for my dining pleasure gets a good vote to begin with. Mel's is a staple in the Annex for late morning brunch and very early morning snacks after a night out. 

  Located on Bloor and Brunswick, for about $10 you can get a decently large breakfast of the usual eggs and fixings, or my favourite, their Montreal smoked meat. Now, I've been to Montreal a few times and never miss the opportunity for their local smoked meat, ever famous, deli sandwich. I'm happy to say that the sandwich at Mel's is equally satisfying! (Not to mention, it is the one place in the city that actually sells authentic Montreal smoked meat!)

 In the summer time, Mel's has a large outdoor patio that is great for coffee and people watching. The service is usually on the slow side but I know they've been short-staffed there and incredibly busy for as long as I can remember. For that, the local Mel's clients bare it with a smile and sit back and enjoy the atmosphere and comforting grub!"}
{"text":"I've been here breakfast a few times and the experience has always been great. They do a really good job of basic breakfast food and if you live in the area, it's a great place to go to get delicious and cheap food in the morning. 

I order eggs, sausage toast and hashbrowns and they are always soo tasty. In the summer, I've sat outside on the patio for hours and hours, drinking cappuccino and chatting. The service is always super fast and friendly and whenever I'm in the area, I always make a point to go and eat here. If you're in the neighbourhood, definitely hit up Mel's."}
{"text":"While I have been known to come here once in a while, Mel's really isn't all that.  I have always found the service lacking here.  They're slow and hard to flag down.  Their breakfast is often bland and their deli sandwiches aren't anything special.  

The two food exceptions about this place is the Montreal Smoked Meat, and the Eggs Benedict (which is made with Montreal Smoked Meat.)

The real saving grace of this restaurant/diner is the fact that it's open 24/7.  It's a viable option at 4am when the whole world is closed and asleep.

For the most part, I consider Mel's to be a bit of a last resort.  It's nice to have a 24hour diner on Bloor, because there really are days when you're thankful for it.  But most times if there's another option, I'll take it."}

OK I've only been to this place once

But I LOVED it

It's a Canadian meat and potatoes kind of place. 

The poutine with the Montreal Smoked meat is FRIGGIN AWESOME

It's fries it gravy, poutine, cheese, piled a mile high (ok maybe just a few inches) with Montreal Smoked meat *drools* 

Think nachos, but canadian style....it's sssoooo bad for you, but it just tastes sssoooooo GOOOD"}
{"text":"Alright, this is a little tricky. I have been noticing people all complimenting the smoked meat at Mel's, listing it as the best thing there. The trouble: I have somewhat recently (in the last few years or so) become very aware of the difference in the smoked meat of say, Schwartz's of Montreal, as well as various other quality delis in New York (which do not specialize in the exact same style, but are backed by the same quality, precision and reputation). Tell a self-proclaimed deli connoiseur that you think Mel's does smoked meat right and they will most certainly get all up in your face about it. I have seen it happen. The smoked meat is unquestionably of a different calibre than these beloved institutions, but I still enjoy it for what it is (and besides, there is so much more they have to offer).

Anyway, that being said, I love Mel's more than words can say. Some of my most formative years (and nights) were spent at those tables with the newspaper articles displayed under the glass top (about the very large family that owns the place), and I can't look into those bathroom mirrors without seeing myself drunk , mascara-smeared and five years younger (ouch). It is definitely an excellent post-drinking choice (and its location across the street from the dance cave made it second nature in my younger days), an excellent breakfast choice, an excellent place to go to reward yourself for an all-night library session and watch the sun come up with a friend. I have ordered plates of stacks of French toast, all day breakfasts, smoked meat sandwiches (yeah, that's right)  and more \"traditional club\" sandwiches than you can shake a stick at.

Worth noting: theirs is the only poutine I have ever even liked, and even loved and actually ordered, and I still have never brought myself to try that Monte Cristo sandwich which is made on French toast (!?), but almost do, every time. Take your non-deli-snob friends at any time of night and bask in the comfort and food (that equals comfort food)."}
