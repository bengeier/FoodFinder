{"text":"The mushroom toast was good, and also tried with socca. Service were nice and warm. It's nice to have a try with the Nice tradition, but not really my style, and also a little bit overpriced. Might not go again."}
{"text":"Allons droit au but, voici la version grunge de l'Express, antimode dans le design, rien d'ostentatoire dans l'assiette, tout est dans le goût et la qualité. Bio, petit, charmant, coloré sans être débraillé. Et que dire de Caroline Dumas et son équipe qui nous accueillent comme si on était à la maison. On adore."}
{"text":"Delicious meals, impeccable service, ideal location. Second visit, this time with a larger group (we were five). The service was excellent and helpful, and fluently bilingual (a great help to my guests, all from Vancouver and with no functional French). The group ate soup, lamb, burger, chicken, and all of it was sublime. Bottle of wine, some great desserts, and suddenly we were almost three hours into the evening. Le Bloomfield sits at the top of my go-to, intimate restos."}
