{"text":"First of all,  let me say that my wife and I really like the food here.  Why we are giving it three stars is that our main courses arrived minutes after our appetizer arrived.  This is the second time this has happened).  Nice that our server apologized though the kitchen needs to get their act together (especially with a restaurant less than 1/3 full)"}
{"text":"Insanely good traditional Mexican food here. Nice staff. Expensive but worth it for a nice date night."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight.

Food was seasoned perfectly!  Not bland and not overpowering... it was just perfect!  Better than other Mexican places I've tried.

Service was great - warm & friendly.  Food took a while to come out but that's related to the kitchen and not the serving staff.

I'd eat here again and recommend it!"}
{"text":"After reading Milagro's menu online, I had very high expectations. I lived in Mexico City for 5 years and it looked like a menu I would have seen there. I was unfortunately quite disappointed when I went to try it though. The meat was dry, the agua de sandia (watermelon water) flavourless, and they seemed to be catering to Canadian expectations of Mexican food rather than serving the authentic fare they claim to. 

This place has so much potential. Good location(s), cool interior, and a menu that reads extremely well. I wish the owners would take a trip back to Mexico so they can remember what authentic Mexican food is supposed to be and serve it like that."}
{"text":"I had such a great time here I brought my husband back a few weekends later.  I LOVED the margaritas, and the food was excellent.  Wonderful service."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place  on the plus side their ingredients are noticeably fresh. The service is friendly   The food is \"good\"  It ends there for me.   Their use of fresh ingredients although a plus is not a substitute for talent in the kitchen    I find their food one note, simple and a bit boring.  Their food is good as I wrote but not great.  I don't  believe you would leave there upset but you also won't probably leave excited or inspired.    Their service is friendly but it isn't particularly thoughtful.  Drinks run dry even when you are the only table in the house while the hostess stands and stares at your table and you still can't get her attention and your waiter is MIA   I think Milagro could and should be more   They have the right ideas but needs a better oiling of their machine."}
{"text":"Delicious. My mom and I stopped in there the other night for a quick meal. WHOA! Everything we ordered was amazing. We got shrimp tacos and the rib eye beef tacos. The guacamole was fresh and perfect on the freshly made chips. My mom said her margarita was great. While we waited for dessert, our waiter brought out 2 Mexican hot chocolates on the house. How sweet! Dessert was also wonderful. We actually considered going there for dinner the very next night it was so good. The service was excellent throughout our meal and the atmosphere was wonderful. Please try it out - so good!"}
{"text":"I had the burrito adobado..not sure if I spelt that correctly.
Wait time..3/5
Service.. 4/5

Taste of the food..5/5
I enjoyed it, it was quite tasty. I'll probably be back"}
{"text":"Our dining experience was in the winter, seated near the kitchen, so great to watch them cooking, and toasty warm.  However... The food was very average and overpriced for portion and quality. I did find the guac amazing though... or maybe I was just hungry.

Fast forward to summer and we hear live music coming from their UPSTAIRS bar and lovely patio.  A live Latin rock band was playing funkily upstairs... Happy people were hubbubbing in Spanish and GIANT margaritas made my night. I felt like the architecture of the upstairs room was really neat and music sounded great in there. I think this room upstairs in a GREAT weekend bar!"}
{"text":"I actually hadn't read any reviews about this place before we went, and I really wish I would have. 
Our server was rude, miserable and slow. The overall staff seemed to hate their life and wasn't afraid to let us know.
The food was extremely bland and uninspired.
I'd sooner eat from a box of Old El Paso then return to Milagro."}
{"text":"Tomatillos in ceviche? Eh. Milagro bills itself as authentic Mexican, but definitely takes liberties in its interpretation of the classics. The mole was pretty good and the enchiladas w/ green sauce were the best thing we ordered, but, alas, we still haven't found our Mexican fix in Toronto."}
{"text":"A lot of mixed ratings for this place, I see. I just got back from here about an hour ago and my boyfriend and me were both quite pleased with our meals. Except for one little screw up, but I'll get to that in a minute.

We had a margarita and a glass of sangria. They arrived quickly and were nice and refreshing. My boyfriend ordered 2 pork and 2 beef tacos and I got 2 chicken tacos. We also got the guacamole and thought it was really good in both flavor and portion size. When the tacos came, it wasn't our waiter who brought them out and when he asked who had what, my boyfriend said that I had the chicken. The plates were put in front of us and we went to town.

Now, about 2 months ago, I decided to give up all meat but chicken (eventually that will go, too). We were both eating our tacos and it wasn't until I was done my first one that I realized that I was supposed to have lettuce on my taco and that it was supposed to be a hard taco. Wait, that's what my boyfriend had! We asked the waiter and he confirmed that I was eating the pork and my boyfriend was eating the chicken. The pork was pretty spicy to me, and the pieces were cut thin, and a little overdone, which is why I didn't think anything of it. So that part is a little unfortunate. We switched, of course, and I then got to enjoy the chicken taco and I liked it much better than the pork. It was flavorful and the crema on top was nice. 

We'll definitely be back for drinks and gauc, and maybe leave room for some dessert next time."}
{"text":"This was a good Mexican place. Kinda pricey for lunch though. I had a 'classico' dish Cochinita with pulled pork and it came with retried beans, pickled timelier and tortilla. I enjoyed it. Would go back again."}
{"text":"3 Stars on Yelp........???????? Nonsense. Ridiculously good. Good value too. Ceviche and Enchiladas. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This place was in a little tucked away street so it was a little hard to find.

I went here for a work party; the atmosphere and setting was good though I don't really recommend going in a hugeeee group. 

There was a big range of items to choose from on the menu however I ended up ordering the mole parlando. TBH it wasn't that great;  the chicken was pretty dry and the sauce was ehhhhh. If I didn't have the sauce to cover it up I probably wouldn't have able to swallow it down. 

We also ordered nachos and salsa and that it always a classic as you could never really go wrong with that.

Overall it was an okay experience but don't think I would go back again."}
{"text":"This review is late - I have now gone twice and can justify by experience - since it was quite similar 

Experience #1 - Saturday Brunch

Very slow service. When I brought it up nicely (I had waited 20 minutes before a server even came close to me), the server was nice about it, but she noted it was very busy. It actually was not at full capacity - and seemed like an excuse. 

Other tables seemed to also be getting annoyed, noting servers were taking orders to people who came in later than them, them getting food earlier etc. I was starving before our food came. 

The food was pretty good, but as others have noted, not a wow experience. 

If you have some to linger, than I would suggest this place. It might have just been a bad day for them? well maybe not - see experience #2

Experience #2 - Friday Dinner 

Our dinner plans got changed and a friend decided on Milagro. OK, been there before, remembered waiting forever, but there were meal options for me with my allergies. 

Same thing happened - waited forever for our server to take our order. I was very explicit about my order and being gluten-free. 

We waited well over an hour to get our meal. Our guacamole did come before  - but we still had to wait quite awhile for it as well. The server screwed up my order (I was deciding between two dishes) but said I could have it on the house but I would have to wait a bit for my entree. I double-checked if the tortillas were corn and started eating it as I was starving - well they were flour! I stopped eating and told the server I specifically requested corn and gluten-free. 

Though I didn't pay for that error - I did get sick from the flour tortillas. 

All in all I would never go back here. The food is good, but not worth the wait nor service (nor risking being glutened)."}
{"text":"Great food.
Slow (but relatively friendly) service.
Fairly pricey food.

Ancho pulled pork burrito is amazeballs.

What happened to the spanish rice side? The roasted corn replacement is not very good..."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Authentic atmosphere. Friendly staff. Food was delicious. 
It was hard to read the menu in the light but the wait staff explained the options. 
Well worth a try."}
{"text":"I went to Milagro this past Saturday night.  I'd been there before.  I'd had a bad experience, followed by two good ones (I only returned after the bad one because my sister insisted on going there).  

But this past weekend was the last time.  We were seated at a patio table that was inside.  The arms of the chairs were sticky with something and they were clearly made for the outdoors.  

The service was spotty.  One guy was great when it came to describing the tequilas but apart from that, nothing to write home about.

The food was fine. We had the guacamole and nacho chips, which were great but fairly standard.  The mole enchiladas left a lot to be desired and the rest of my party found the food fine to eat, but we had certainly experienced better Mexican food before.  

This time, we won't be returning to Milagro."}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent real Mexican food in a laid-back atmosphere. Try the shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Well we wanted to try an different mexican restaurant...started out decent but after not wanting drinks from the bar all service disappeared. Waiter took our order for appetizer and when brought that out took rest of our order. He then did not return....food was brought by others and then they cleaned plates off as fast as we finished them. We then sat for 10 - 15 min with a empty table...no waiter , no bill, no coffee, no desert,...nothing - finally managed to wave someone down for our bill then got out of there fast. food was okay."}
{"text":"Passed by this establishment on vacation from NYC. Recently opened authentic Mexican restaurant located in a 100 year old Spanish style building with a roof deck patio. Everything about this place was perfect. The mole pablano is a must have. Margaritas are perfect for a summers day or night. Manager introduced himself to myself and other dining guest. One of the nicest and friendly gentlemen I have encountered in my dining experiences. Will have to return to this place on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"When it comes to mexican food, I am the furthest thing away from the last word. I admit it, I'm a mexican food dunce and what better way to make me feel EVEN more estupida than handing me a lunch menu full of Espanol. Tacos, taquitos, burritos, pescasdos, pollos, refritos = a very confused diner. extensive menu navigation later, I settled on Classic sangria, guacamole, and what I thought were taquitos but were actually tacos. el diablo at that. 

The sangria had no fruit. Not one lemon in sight. It was a much watered down and sour version of the sangria I'm used to (the one with fruits). There are a few varieties on the menu and the classic must have been the most barren of them all. The guacamole was the most authentic at mashed avocados, tomatoes and a hint of cilantro and lemon. Its pleasant when you can count and see the number of ingredients in your food. 

Next up was the tuna tacos and they met my expectations. A little lacklustre with chunks of tuna, sauteed onions and a slice of avocado  with a side of rice and frijoles refritos (refried beans) that look and taste like a thick chocolate fudge.  The El Diablo part was there but not pleasantly. The spice really stood out from the rest of the taco and I had to guac it over for some taste.

I needed another drink to wash it all down and it happened to be the tamarind margarita. Now thats something everyone should order at Milagro. They are open for drinks all day and do cocktails really well. I went here for lunch and dinner (not on the same day obv.) and the dinner menu and service is much better than lunch. 

Did you know enchiladas were originated in Mexico? Neither did I."}
{"text":"Although we wanted to try new Mexican restaurant, we were very disappointed the attitude of a waitress at Milagro. We called them to make sure if we need to make reservation for 2 people before and they said not necessary since the time was still early for dinner. When we arrived there, the waitress asked us if we made reservation, of course we didn't that's they told us. The place was empty, and she still had to check the computer if there was a table for us, only 2 people! When we checked the menu, this is a pricy restaurant and they should train the staff more professionaly. My husband is from Mexico, he couldn't stand this rude attitude. Too bad. They just lost new customers. We went to El Jacal, our favourite. They treated us like a family and food reminded us home and lovely mother's taste."}
{"text":"I had the octopus tacos, ceviche and a side of guac. The ceviche was standout, nice and acidic and tasty. I wasn't a huge fan of the octopus tacos though - maybe I overdid it on the seafood, but they just didn't stand out as being octopussy enough (hah). 

That said, I would go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to both locations of Milagro, and neither one impressed me.  

This location I have been to twice, and I wish so badly that it was better.

Mostly the service is Terrible, seriously bad, all 3 times I've been to Milagro, some of the worst service ever.

If you think you are better than everyone, smarter than everyone and more handsome than everyone -- you should go work at Milagro, because the people that work there are better, smarter and beautiful (in their mind).

The food is ok, nothing amazing, and don't ask the waiter to explain anything, you better know Mexican inside and out, because they can't stand people who need help with the menu.

Oh seriously, where do I get my Mexican fix??"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was pretty bad. It took us ages to get the attention of the waitress when we needed something. Also it's pretty annoying that they would refuse to split the bill at the end.

They ran out of mole, the previous time they ran out of green salsa."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and margaritas but for 2 people and we shared an entree it was $178.00! I was under the impression this was ranked with $$ not $$$$!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what these other folks are talking about when they say the service was poor. I had an amazing meal with no rez and got sat as soon as possible with utmost courtesy. When the side order didn't arrive on time it was even comp'd. If you listen to these other folks you are doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant but often filled with children which kinda cramps on the tequila tasting experience... 
The food is good but really overpriced. I recommend the enchilada rojas, I really enjoy it. Also a decent place for a real mojito."}
{"text":"I can sum up the entire experience as \"not impressed\".

I got to the restaurant before my party arrived, with no reservation (on a Saturday night). The reason we had no reservation was because we called ahead and thye said they don't take reservations before 9. Okay...but when I got there they asked, \"reservation?\". No...you said we couldn't...so clearly I was miffed. So I put my name down for the 4 of us.  There were at least a few empty tables so I figured we wouldn't be waiting long. 1/2 hour later we still didn't have a table, but 4 guys who arrived after us (also without reservation) were seated before we were.

Once we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for someone to come over and take our drink order. We were ready to order our food too, but they wouldn't take it down right then. Took 15 minutes to get the drinks. Sangria was delicious...sadly the best part of the meal.  And luckily the food arrived not too long after we ordered.

Well, too bad the food was lackluster. I paid 6.95 to make my  tacos capital (10.95) an entree...which apparently means making 2 tacos 3, and adding a small heaping of rice to the refried beans. The tacos had no flavor. They came with salsa verde and lime, which I had to heap on just to make it taste like SOMETHING (which frankly still wasn't great). I've had much better tacos from food trucks! The refried beans and rice were good, and I sampled my friend's spicy corn which was also very good.

For the sangria and tacos entree, it came to almost 35 with tax and tip, for a thoroughly disappointing meal. My friends had the burritos which were good according to them, but nothing spectacular.

For the price and slow service, I can't see why I'd ever come back here. I left still feeling hungry!

As an aside, another gripe is the noise level. The music is blared so loud that I couldn't hear the server when he was describing one of the meals."}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Waitresses and barmen were all talkative - and attentive.
Both ceviches we tried were way too acidic, too sour to even finish. 
Small guacamole was $8. Really?!
Tacos were good though.
But we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"When we walked into this place we had ample opportunity to change our minds and walk out. It took us that long to get noticed and to be seated. However, we were too tired to walk around town and decide where to eat, so there we were. Our server was nice and recommended a couple of dishes. My husband ordered one of the specials with rib eye and I got the shrimp taco plate. The customary chips and salsa took forever to arrive and our meal took even longer. I have not idea if we thought the food was good because we were so darn hungry or if it was actually good. The shrimp was a bit tough, but flavorful. But who knows, it could be the hunger talking. With the number of restaurants in this city, can't say I'd recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"A delicious and amazing Mexican food experience! Very authentic (having visited Mexico City recently), very tasty food, amazing margaritas and friendly service. My fav Mexican restaurant in Toronto by far."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing. From a mexican visiting Canada, the food is very authentic. Tinga, cochinita pibíl and churro were awesome. Tortillas are great too. Thanks so much! Everything is very yummy. Carlos, our server, was the most attentive. :)"}
{"text":"The food is not bad but it's very expensive for what you get. I usually go on Margarita Tuesdays where the Margaritas are about 10$...they are almost 20$ on a regular basis, which is asinine because they are full of ice, sugar and not full of alcohol. 

I wouldn't highly recommend Milagros to anyone but, when I went, I enjoyed the Atun contramar (although small-ass portions), I like their chips, ceviche but the best thing I had was the salad with jicama, cilantro and mango (can't remember the name). I was shocked but it was the best thing I had there yet."}
{"text":"I recognize that Canadians aren't necessarily after authentic Mexican food. There is nothing wrong with that. Americanized Mexican food (or Tex-Mex) is its own breed and can be very delicious. I'm reviewing this restaurant on the basis that authenticity is not (and, for this market, should not be) the benchmark. 

The food here is not just inauthentic. It's, well, bad.

I ate here over a year ago and wasn't at all impressed. I had the chicken with mole. The mole had way too much cocoa. It was like eating dessert chicken. In case you've never tried to dessert chicken, let me tell you that it's not appetizing. I'm a fan of second chances so I tried Milagro again last night with a group of friends. I was equally disappointed. I had enchiladas suizas which were pretty much inedible. I picked at them for a little while and then gave up. The corn tortillas were way too thick, the tiny amount of chicken with which the tortillas were stuffed was pretty dry and the sauce was too acidic and had no depth of flavour. The guacamole was way over-salted but otherwise had good consistency and flavour. The saltiness could have been a one-off but, to be safe, I'd suggest asking for half salt (and then add your own to taste). 

For drinks, stick with the classic margarita on the rocks (upgrade to 100% blue agave tequila if the classic comes with anything less). For authenticity, ask for it without agave nectar. If you need the sweet stuff, order as is.

I don't recommend eating here. There are other Mexican and Tex-Mex options in the city (albeit, very few) that serve much more palatable food."}
{"text":"Service was rough the first time but second time around was much better. Food was good, but spicy. They made a stink about being at our table longer than 2 hours because of the anticipated rush, we obviously left much before then."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband after hearing from others that the food is great. We didn't have service issues whatsoever and if anything our server was amazing. Guiding us through the different ingredients, making suggestions and finding the right balance between being attentive and giving us space.

As for the food here is what we ordered. We shared the guac and chips, both got tortilla soup, I ordered the tuna and octopus taco and he order the chicken burrito.

The guac is the tha bomb. I couldnt get enough of it, although its very expensive, 8 bucks for a small mini dish and 15 for a larger dish. 

The tortilla soup, wasn't the tortilla soup I expected because I remember it being a clear broth and not spicy. They was like a chipotle puree and SPICEY! The server warned it was hot and boy was she right. I put some of the guac in my soup to cool it down. I dont think I would order this again just because it wasn't the tortilla soup I was looking for.

My husband LOOOOVED his burrito. He said its the best burrito, wrap, sandwich he has ever had. He could only eat half and we took the other half home.

My tacos, the tacos are considered appetizers but I was pretty full for some reason even though I arrived at the restaurant hungry. Thank goodness I didnt order two sets of tacos as I originally intended. Like I said I ordered the octopus and tuna taco. It was spicy and bursting with flavour. I only managed to eat one of my two tacos and took the other one home. I will try the other tacos next time just for variety but this was excellent.

The key points about this place is the food is crazy fresh, and their dishes are all bursting with flavour. We now have a new go to place for good food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service here and is a great location as well! We order 3 taco dishes- fish tacos, pork and steak, all were delicious especially fish tacos. It is a little bit on the pricier side ($10-$13 for each dish) as there were only 2 tacos per dish. But it was worth the price. 

My friend and I ordered drinks as well, I order Pint of beer and she got the classic margaritas. The margaritas seemed to be loaded with ice, so there was not a lot of liquids which was not really worth the price paid for (~$11). The beer on the other hand for great.

We also ordered desserts as well- plate of churros and cheesecake. Both were amazing and was definitely the highlight of our meal.

Overall we had a great time and would recommend trying this place out if you are around the Entertainment District and looking for somewhere near the subway or Go station."}
{"text":"Noticed this place on winterlicious restaurant list. I've heard amazing reviews about Milagro. We ordered margaritas to start. The glass was massive! It was delicious! They make the lime juice from scratch, no preservatives.... You can taste the freshness! We then black bean chorizo soup. Followed by a succulent steak covered in a pablano pepper and white wine sauce. I was a little worried about the pepper but it was amazing. So tasty! Not spicy. For dessert I had a creme brûlée made with goats milk and caramel. The ambiance was romantic. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"In a city that is loaded with Mexican joints this place needs to do better. It is very nice, service was great and has a great upstairs patio but the food didn't blow me away. the guacamole is just OK, the salsa were a little better, the best item was the tuna ceviche, the Arrachera was not very good and the La Perla was just OK. I'd go back but not in a rush"}
{"text":"You MUST their guacamole. The lime gives it a bit of a kick and it is delicious. I always get a large bowl whenever I go and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them zero stars but Yelp wouldn't let me. Really bad on all fronts. Bad service, bad food, and no AC. Fortunately there are many better Mexican restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"One word

WOW

OK two....
Amazing!

Just come here and eat. Your taste buds will demand a vacation. 

Wow

Plus ya get to hang with the Hotels dot com guy!

Serious. Ya gotta cone here!!! Its amazing"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mexican food and I was not disappointed the food was tasty and the portions were generous. I love the atmosphere and décor of the restaurant and my friend and I had a good time.
Why only three stars? time, it simply took too long for the food to arrive, normally I wouldn't mind so much but we had a movie to catch and this stressed us out.
I will come back when I have more time."}
{"text":"I had the octopus ceviche salad and the guac for app and my main was the lamb ! I absolutely loved the guac it tasted so authentic ! It's a must have , and as for the ceviche I'm not sure if I'm so use to eating a bit bland or if there was too much lime or vinegar but the taste was a bit too strong for my preference. The lamb was absolutely amazing, it was so tender it melted in my mouth ! I definitely recommend it. The customer service was nice and friendly, but make sure you make a reservation because I overheard other people who hadn't booked for one had to wait at least 30mins to be seated ! Overall this place is a must try !"}
{"text":"I had dinner on the upstairs patio with a friend. We had guacamole to start which was quite good and I had a delicious cucumber maragarita which was very refreshing. Our food was fine, but nothing special. I find the cost of the food a bit steep considering most of the ingredients are fairly simple and the preparation pretty basic. Rice, beans, and soft taco shells with filling are not really worth $18 to me. 

There is a problem with the chairs, tables and benches on the patio. The chairs are too low for the tables, and the benches are much to high. These kind of details are important, and I feel like they should be considered, especially in a Queen West restaurant that is existing amongst many well designed spaces. So my friend towered over me while I rested my chin on the table.

The service was acceptable, but not particularly welcoming or informative.
I would not make a repeat visit."}
{"text":"The food is here is great and I like the ambiance but the service is terrible. The servers are really nice and friendly and polite but they are soooooo slow and it's next to impossible to get their attention. If you have lots of time and aren't starving then this is a great place to eat but it takes a long time to get seated and a long time to get drinks and a long time to order and a long time to get the bill, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Mexican food in Toronto!  Of course, it is really hard to find any good Mexican food in Toronto period.  For that, you will need to go to the US.  However, I found that Milagro had a great variety of dishes from different regions of Mexico, including the Yucatan, and all the dishes had absolutely spectacular flavours.  Drinks were superb as well!  Too bad this location is no longer open for lunch!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

They have the best Tacos Rosarito I have ever tasted!!! I order it every time I am there. I have also made every one of my guest try it too and they love it. The Shrimp is super tender and moist, and I love the fact that it is not battered like most places.

I've had a lot of food from here.
I have the Guacamole, it's your typical good guac, but it's like $8.50 for a small bowl...a little pricey
Rosarito - amazing
Carnitas Los Panchos - good - pork tacos, great combinations of flavours
Playeros - good - flavourful chicken
La Perla - awesome! - fish taco.. the fish is so tender and the batter is not too thick.

Barbacoa Pachuca - delicioso - slow roasted lamb. The meat is soft!
Cochinita Pibil - delicioso - slow roasted pork---amazing with the pickled onions
Enchilada Rojas - bueno - it's good just not as good as the tacos...in my opinion

only down side is service is a little slow. so don't go if you are in a rush to eat and run, it won't happen.

It's a must, if you are looking good mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nice enough place, but I found the food to be a little pricey for what you get. It was tasty, but nothing to write home about. Also, the guacamole had way too much lime for my liking, but the mole was good."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. I ordered a main with pulled pork and it was a bit cold and bland. The server was friendly but holy shit was she slow at serving... took forever. 

I had a group on deal but would probably never pay full price here for what is typical Mexican food."}
{"text":"We go whenever we can.  A little on the pricier side, but the food is excellent, as is the tequila selection.  Highly recommended.  The Tacos Adobados get me every time.  Also, their refried beans are amazing."}
{"text":"I get better Mexican good at Milagros then I regularly do in Cancun.

Guacamole is perfect, carnitas are fantastic and an amazing tequila selection - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this place is as authentic as a British or Irish pub on this side of the pond.

We went specifically for fish tacos, so with the server's suggestion we ordered the Pescado Rodrigo (red snapper). The soft tortillas come on the side with a plate featuring a piece of fish that you have to pull apart and a scant amount of other toppings. As usual, there is plenty of fish available after you run out of tortilla shells.

The tacos were decent, but they weren't anything extraordinary. It felt like something was missing. After asking each other \"What do you think?\" about 5 times, we finally agreed that it was average.

As a side, the dish came with baby potatoes. When I'm eating something like fish tacos, potatoes are the last thing I want as a side, however.

With a beer and a cocktail, the tab came to $60 before a tip. The service was fine until the end, when we had to wait awhile for the server to take my credit card, and then we had to wait another lifetime for him to come back and process the transaction.

One visit was enough."}
{"text":"Really awesome and authentic Mexican food & wait staff. The ambiance of the restaurant is top notch. 
Their burritos are excellent and their beef taco + cilantro taco appetizers are very fresh and flavourful.
Their complimentary chips are great - especially the salsa. 
The only thing is that it's very authentic Mexican food and drink. They don't even carry Ginger Ale! So that's annoying.
But I've eaten at both the Yonge/Lawrence location and Mercer Street. Both have been great experiences. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went here late on a Friday night. Lively atmosphere. Excellent food. I found the menu reasonably priced. Service good, relaxed and very friendly.  They forgot my friend's salmon but they were quick to solve issue."}
{"text":"Absolutely flawless service every time I've been there. The food is really very good and they have a nice selection of wine - seriously good wine. For someone who doesn't drink Tequila, it's important for me to find a good Mexican restaurant that has a good wine selection. Nice place to go with a bunch of people. Can't say enough good about this place."}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic and spicy.  The guacamole was straight out of texmex - fresh, tomatoey, and great for dipping.  The enchilada trio was a fabulous sampling of flavors from the traditional mole to the spicier alternatives.  It's got great energy- you can talk inside but you can't whisper.  On a warm day, the outside seating is fabulous"}
{"text":"Came here having never heard of, seen, or read about Milagro and it was nice to visit a restaurant with an entirely open mind.

First impressions were good. The host was friendly and the restaurant was huge and very spacious(a rarity in Toronto). There was a lovely patio overlooking John Street which contributed to a fun, vibrant atmosphere.

We were seated and given menus. First thing I noticed was that the chicken burrito (burrito tinga) that I had been eyeing up from outside on the window menu was listed as fifty cents more expensive on the inside menus than the price quoted outside. Not a big deal, but the principle of the price discrepancy was a bit annoying. I also raised an eyebrow at their strict no modifications or substitutions policy, described at the bottom of the menu. I get that this restaurant wants to be seen as authentic, and understand that excessive mods/subs can indeed ruin a dish, but what happened to customer choice?! This restaurant isn't cheap, and I would expect a bit more in terms of accommodating  fussy customers considering the prices of some menu items. Oh, and while I'm ranting about the menu - it was weird how the outside menu was mostly listed in Spanish, and the inside menus were mostly in English. Again, I understand the desire to be seen as authentic, but for non-Spanish speakers, spending time deciphering the outside menu was a bit of a chore.

We ordered some water and juice, and was pleased to see that both were served with ice, as the menu warns you that the food is spicy! We also received complimentary nachos and salsa. Yay! Our server was really friendly, but unfortunately disappeared the entire time between us receiving our  drinks and us requesting the bill some time later. That isn't a problem (I'm not into this whole 'build a relationship with your server' crap), but her replacement was a guy who was clearly multi-tasking between cooking in the kitchen and serving. Complete with food-stained apron, I felt sorry for the guy, as he was clearly uncomfortable in his serving role and didn't seem to be enjoying it at all.

Our food arrived, and I was delighted with my burrito. The portion wasn't huge considering I paid $13, and the accompanying side salad was just a slice of lettuce and two spicy carrots. But, like all good Mexican food, it left me feeling stuffed. I can sort of appreciate their 'no mods/subs' policy a bit more now, as all the ingredients in my burrito just blended PERFECTLY with each other. It really felt like each ingredient was measured out to be in perfect proportion with everything else. The roasted chicken was cooked perfectly and the spice level was indeed quite high, but nothing excessive or extraordinary. The tortilla was also just right - you know how so often burritos are either burnt and crunchy, or undercooked, so that you can taste all the dough? No fears of that here. Everything was just right.

Unfortunately, my bf didn't feel the same about his enchilada rojas. I immediately noticed the poor presentation of his dish when it arrived. It looked like it had been pre-made and microwaved (I'm not suggesting for a second that his meal WAS, in fact, microwaved, it just had that soggy, flat appearance). He was disappointed with the sauce on his dish, and described the overall meal as 'ok'. But for $17, you expect a lot more than just 'ok'. His dish was also the same size as mine, which I thought was strange, as his was much more expensive than mine.

In terms of the food I personally ate, I would give this 4 stars (at least!). But I like to factor everything into my reviews, and my overall experience here was a 3. I got the sense that the customer wasn't the priority here - there really is no excuse for price discrepancies between the inside and outside menus. So many contradictions! There was a noticeable difference in quality between my meal and my bf's - why??  A lovely sofa in the ladies' washroom, yet paper and water on the floor. A server who was friendly and helpful, yet who disappeared for most of our time spent here with no explanation.

This place could be great, with a bit (or maybe a lot) more care and effort. If you go, get the roast chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Far better than expected this far north. I'm from So Cal and work a lot in Mexico. Tacos Adobados were some of the best tacos I've had. Proper micheladas too. A pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"The only reason this place has 3 stars instead of 2 stars is because of the cheese flan!

Chicken burrito- was OK, the bean paste was too strong, and there was no enough chicken. Literally for $13 all you get is a burrito, no side salad or anything.

Lime margarita- SO much tequila!!!!! I know, I know, that's usually not a bad thing, but the taste was unbearable! 

3 items below are from the Summerlicious 2015 menu. $18 for lunch.

Chilled avocado soup- pretty much tasted like a smoother guacamole 

Chicken enchiladas - 4/5, this was pretty good! The salsa complimented the rice perfectly.

Cheese flan - If cheesecake and caramel flan were to have a baby, this would be the creation. It was simply amazing. I'd come back just for the cheese flan.

Aside from the subpar food, the service and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"We have been repeat customers to Milagro. This was a special reservation, made for my birthday. Rather than making this the BEST visit we have ever had, it was the worst.

We were seated at a sub-par table, next to another couple when most of the restaurant was vacant. We could have been given a better table, a booth, anything. We were never asked, only seated. 

Our appetizer, the cod tacos which we have ordered before was soggy, tasted different from previous experiences, and was less than superb. Our server came to clear the our main plate of appetizers, and the side plate of my fiance, making a comment that he needed new cutlery - but left my dirty plate and dirty cutlery without even commenting to me - or looking at me. Note: THIS WAS MY BIRTHDAY as stated in the notes of the reservation. When our main courses came, rather than realizing that she left my side plate and dirty cutlery, she struggled to slide it into the middle of our small crammed table. Note: Our appetizer was fish, and I had ordered pork.. Obviously needing new cutlery. Did she only want to suck up to the person she thought was paying the bill? Only after I stated quite bluntly: Do you think you could remove *MY* plate and bring *ME* new cutlery did she do so.

The mains were ok, though I barely touched mine - seemingly having lost my appetite. When we asked to have our items packed up, our to go items were packed in one box - which included our appetizers AND mains - which totally ruined the extra large guacamole we ordered to partially take to go - it was covered with rice and part of my main. At no point did anyone try to do anything special for my birthday like offer a dessert, etc -- or even comment on it.  Our waitress then proceeded to ask if we were doing \"anything special\" for the rest of the night, to which I didn't even engage at that point -- and then complained about the cold weather and her walk to work and clothing choices when we were paying.. Note: This was my birthday and they should have created the special evening, in part. The fact this reservation was for a birthday was clearly stated in the comments. 

Total bomb. I have absolutely no desire to go back to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone. Period."}
{"text":"We picked this place randomly after walking past it one night and were pleasantly surprised with the experience. I ordered the burrito with steak and bacon (which was also full of beans and rice and all sorts of deliciousness) and he had the pulled pork tacos--sadly can't remember the actual names! The food wasn't outstanding by any means, but it was pretty good and everything was fresh and full of flavour. The portions are large and I was doubting whether or not I would finish, but in the end I just about managed, so that's got to tell you something about the food. The service, too, was attentive. 

The only complaint I'd have is that it was a Thursday, which means it was sangria special night, and the waiter didn't mention it. If we'd known, we would have gotten the sangria special instead of beers! This way we ended up paying more and were disappointed that he hadn't mentioned it.

Overall pretty good, though."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I always make reservations via the OpenTable app and never have a problem getting seated. Good prices in relation to portion size. The staff is friendly (but perhaps TOO helpful at times) and they are as authentic Mexican as the food is. Beware: They don't shy away from spicy flavors; even their Caesar is spiced with Habanero!

Also of note is that they make their own mole sauce!

My only knock is that they painted their back room a solid red color and somewhat smashed the vibe back there...but that is me being picky!"}
{"text":"Well... The service was absolutely terrible - our waiter was barely there and when you asked him for something he looked really annoyed. He basically told us we didn't tip enough and pressured my friend to tip more. The food was OK but way overpriced for what you got. I have never posted a review before but I just need it to   !"}
{"text":"Being from San Francisco and having the luxury of some great Mexican restaurants, I was craving some authentic Mexican food.  My host recommended Milagro as he is from Guadalajara originally so we came for dinner on October 22nd. After learning that the owner was from Mexico City we decided on the following:

Guac and Chips: the avocado with the Serrano pepper, cilantro tomato and lime were spot on and one could tell it was freshly made and not out of a container. So good with that first beer.

Tortilla Sopa: I usually don't order sopa when I eat at a Mexican restaurant but my host encouraged me to try it and it was very good with a slight kick which I liked.

Tostaditas Dona Flora: one of my favorites as well consisting of a corn tortilla, shredded pollo and refried beans as the major ingredients. I could have eaten more of this item and been just as satisfied!

Sopes Plazeros: not as memorable as the tostaditas

Taco Arrachura: I would definitely order this again as well as the marinated flank steak, Serrano pepper, grilled onions and salsa hit the mark for me.

La Perla Taco:  The snapper was limp and not crispy as I am accustomed to.  This was my least favorite  out of everything we tried.

In summary, it is my understanding that Toronto is not known for good Mexican food but I am giving Milagro 4 stars for Toronto but if it was in San Francisco - 3 stars."}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 or 4 times over the past 2 years or so, and the past experiences were enjoyable but nothing stand-outish.

Our most recent experience, this past weekend was exceptional though.  We chose to go there knowing that many/most menu items are gluten-free (corn tortillas!), and we had a celiac friend staying with us.  

Everything we ordered was delicious!  The guacamole is a delicious starter.  I had the Tostadas Dona Flora (which admittedly, I've had every time), and it's a HUGE plate covered in deliciousness.  Crispy tortilla shells with refried beans, tasty tender chicken, sour cream, guac, lettuce.  YUM.  And a side of rice.

My husband had the Red Snapper tacos (which are the only menu item on a flour tortilla - so celiacs beware), and our guest had some plain enchiladas, as she apparently doesn't love spice.  She enjoyed what she ate.

We also scored by ordering 3 gluten-free desserts to share: a dense, cinammon-infused chocolate \"mousse\", and a caramel flan.  Both are impossible to describe, but were delicious!!  

But what made the experience particularly exceptional, was the service.   VERY attentive (to the point that we joked about how many different staff/servers came to check on us).  We were sitting in the booths by the kitchen, so I guess we were in their line of sight, but every staff that passed, asked us how we were enjoying everything.   Even the Colin Firth lookalike chef stopped over to ask how the meal was.  Nice touch!

Here is where Milagro loses the 5th star:   I called earlier in the day in search of a reservation, and was told no reservations were allowed between 6:45 pm and 8:45 pm, and that there was no point in coming between those times, because the wait for a table would be 1 to 2 hours.  We made a reservation for right at 8:45.  At about 7:50 pm, we walking by and starving, so we checked in to see how long the wait was.  There were quite a few empty tables, but we were told they were all accounted for.... I'm not sure how that could be, since reservations weren't allowed during that time.  We decided to have a drink at the bar while waiting for our reservation. Within 2 minutes of standing at the bar (and before even ordering a drink), a table \"came up\".  I would have been surprised if they actually left us at the bar surrounded by empty tables, so I'm glad they pulled through.  But really, the hostess was giving me the impression that it was impossible to get a table, and that we should just give up.  If they hadn't given us a table within minutes of arriving, we may have just eaten elsewhere, because we were way too hungry to wait until 8:45.   
Glad they did though, because we had a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"I had been to the Mercer Street location a few years back and it was awful! So one day a bunch of us are talking about great Mexican and my friend Ted G. mentions Milagro. Our opinions differed greatly because of my awful experience and his apparent amazing experience. Turns out he was talking about the Queen St. location. And boy was he right! The Milagro on a Queen is AMAZING! 

Last night was the second time I ate at Milagro on Queen and I was not disappointed. The food is addictive. As a group we shared the guacamole, a salad (Ensalada Costeña), and the Queso Fundido. 
The ensalada was so nice and refreshing with cucumber, avocado, pineapple and mango with a hint of spice and tang. So delicious!! The queso fundido, well, melted cheese! How can you go wrong?! :D
For the main I had the veggie tacos. It comes with this sauce. I don't know what they put in it but it's so good!

The service is great. They are so friendly and willing to share their top picks. 

Can't wait to go back again :) let's eat!"}
{"text":"Having been to Milagro multiple times, I have noticed the increase in prices and decrease in portion size. I work in the restaurant industry, and when I see an establishment getting greedy, it really bugs me. Flavour-wise though, the food is delicious.

Otherwise, the experience is ok, and the service is GREAT! The music, I was blown away by a couple times- turns out it was an employee's playlist. Really great music."}
{"text":"O man, I can't believe why these people having bad time at this place
Me and some of my friends had blast at Milagro
I had dish called Atun Contramar, It was raw seared tuna with Cucumbers and lime vinaigrette, i can i have one of those any time.
My buddy loved Fillete Poblano, rare cooked as requested beef tenderloin with creamy Chile sauce with beans stewed with bacon
since I was siting right beside kitchen I get to see chefs preparing the food :-)
And the server was also really nice and he gave us so much knowledege about different type of tequilas.
And there fresh made tomato salsa was really nice as well but the chips were ok.
For sure going back again ;-)"}
{"text":"Guacamole ok.  Ribeye tacos were salty to the point of being unable to eat.  Thought food was a bit overpriced for the quantity.  Waitstaff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, because I'm an avid fan of Mexican food and the service was great, but my enchiladas were absolutely drenched in way too much sauce, and the flavours were just...okay. The quality of the food just wasn't worth the trip from Yonge/Bloor.

In case anyone is visiting with eldery friends/relatives: I went here with my dad who had difficulty reading the menu in the low lighting and had to bust out a flashlight!

Bonus points, however, for when the waiter brought us a free slice of cheesecake because he felt he hadn't been paying us enough attention, although we certainly hadn't noticed any problem in that regard."}
{"text":"Great service.

We showed up with no reservation and got seated right away. 

Didn't like the first entree, so they hooked us up with another entree, and took care of it. 

Overall great service. And reaaaally enjoyed the food. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Met up with friends for dinner. The fish tacos were amazing. The chips, salsa and guacamole was delicious as well. Def would recommend this spot to someone wanting Mexican in this area."}
{"text":"Friend has a birthday party here last night as this was one of her favorite places and it was just awful.

- Service was terrible. I think we saw a server maybe every half hour? I had two drinks in three hours and the table frequently had discussions like \"I'm hungry but I am not sure I want to give them more money\" when talking about desert.

- I ordered an appetizer and a main and ended up with two main's while my friend ordered a main and ended up with an appetizer. When I asked where my appetizer was when my main arrived, was told \"Everything is coming out at the same time\" as if that was somehow an explanation.

- You'd think that with Spanish names for everything and a table for 12 the servers might use some common sense and write down who had one in each spot sitting around the table. Instead a server would arrive, say \"who had the X\" and be faced with 12 perplexed people who'd pointed to something on the menu and had no idea (an hour later) what it was called.

- One of my two main's arrived stone cold (the other, which I obviously shared was pretty good). The desert mouse was horrible (five people tasted it and all were revolted)

Needless to say that I hope my friend does not have another event here because there is no other way I'd ever return."}
{"text":"The adobado burrito,  alambre, plazera tosado, queso side (3 slices of fried squeaky cheese!) and salsas were amazing!!"}
{"text":"I noticed some mixed reviews on this place so I was concerned but that was quickly put to rest.

We started off with margaritas (which were enormous) and fresh made nachos, salsa and guacamole. When I say fresh I mean they practically made it in front of me.
Next came the ceviche wish was almost as fresh as our appetizers and even more delicious. 
From there came my burrito, artistically served, just the right size and the most delicious burrito I have ever had. I was blown away. Even buttered corn on the side was fantastic. 

Overall start to finish it was a great meal and Im definitely going back."}
{"text":"I suppose it was my own fault....as usual. 

I should know better than to attempt to eat Mexican Food anywhere in Canada. 

I'd ventured into \"Milagro\" the last time I was in Toronto, about three years ago, and had a vague memory of a  a decent margarita and a half-way edible burrito...but unless the quality of the place has gone precipitously downhill since 2009, it must have been a pretty damned strong drink....because the food this time was HORRIBLE. 

The guacamole tasted like wallpaper paste, colored with a lime Crayola; the accompanying chips had enough salt on them to satisfy a herd of cattle; the salsa seemed to be nothing more than a couple of tomato chunks bobbing for their very lives in a bowl of  watered down ketchup; and the \"vegetarian burrito\" consisted of a cardboard textured tortilla wrapped around room temperature refritos, a single sad lettuce leaf and a solid half inch slab of cold cheese.

If the Mayan Calendar is correct and 2012 is indeed the end of the world, perhaps we should all meet at Milagro to lessen the blow; trust me, after another meal here, The Apocalypse couldn't come soon enough. 

However, to be fair, the Bartender was rather handsome and occasionally bent over to retrieve a bottle from the lower shelves, thus affording This Diner a new and entirely welcome definition of \"South of the Border\". 

So I give the place One Star for his great ass. Otherwise....meh."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for the food and the kitchen because the front of the house is terrible. They are friendly enough but inattentive and forgetful. Food is great but service is terrible."}
{"text":"Cam in here during  WInterlicious . The server was nice and the food was good. And the Flan de Caramelo was a combo of a flan and something from the cheesecake factory. So good!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, plus they make a great sangria :)

We had their fish taco plate, so good. Rice, refried beans 
We also met the chef, very nice guy.... love his menu, will be back for more.
I love mexican food, this restaurant is definitely on my top 5 best mexican restaurants in the city. If you go, make sure you make a reservation, this place gets busy and walk ins have a hard time getting a table. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tortilla chips were a little too greasy, but guacamole was delicious.
Beef tacos were good - tender and not dry. The tortillas were thin but not too thin that they would fall apart. The salsa verde could have used a little more spice, but not bad and complemented the beef.
HOWEVER the mole enchiladas tasted terrible. The bitter Mexican chocolate was too prominent and lacked flavour other than cumin. The nasty aftertaste is thankfully washed down with sangria. The rice and beans standard, though maybe some salt and cilantro would make it taste less earthy. The server was charismatic and the decor kitchy."}
{"text":"After waiting 60 minutes for a table that we were told we could get right away when we called ahead, which was promised in 20 to 30 minutes when we arrived, so why not wait and have some guacamole and drinks, my husband asked the host if the table, like the guacamole and drinks, was just an empty promise. Finally seated after another 10 minute wait with guacamole on the house, we again waited. While the tables around us had great service, we were not even acknowledged with an \"I'll be right with you\" and after another 15 minute wait we gave up and left with a business card with a hand- written promise of free guacamole at any of their locations which we likely will never use. Ten minutes later, we're seated at Swiss Chalet eating our starters."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a couple of friends. We split an order of guac and I got the vegetarian tacuba enchiladas. Overall everything was good, although the food was a bit too salty for my liking."}
{"text":"We celebrated my hubbys birthday here and it was amazing. The food was so well made seasoned  to perfection. The wine we chose was well paired. The tea made in house all organic absolutely the best. It's so beautful inside. We can't wait to go back during our next Toronto stay"}
{"text":"Enjoy waiting twice the amount of time you'd wait in another restaurant? Enjoy being ignored by waiters? Like taking advice about traditional Mexican food by European-accented server whose best recommendation is \"I like tacos generally\"? Then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Nice to go in the daytime and see a totally different view! Was there for a corporate event but enjoyed myself immensely thanks to the amazing food drink and service from Milagro. Highly recommended guacamole... very garlicky and sometimes spicy. Dos equis beer on tap poured by efficient bartenders. Taco heaven!!!!!!!! Very generous with the meat. Everything tastes better when it's free.........."}
{"text":"Decent food but definitely not the best Mexican food ever. Atmosphere could use some improvements, like covering that bright blarring window to the kitchen so it doesnt shine into the dark eating area.  
Very pricey for the menu as well. Serving staff friendly. 
Ok experience, but I had a Groupon so that made it much better price wise"}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try the Milagro on Mercer, so when my friend suggested going there this past Thursday I was game. I was especially excited to try the menu because I am gluten intolerant and other than one item on the menu, I could have everything (this never happens). When I first arrived, my friend hadn't shown up yet so I decided to powder my noise before she arrived. The ladies washroom must be commented on! One stall was out-of-order, another was clogged, which left the last stall. However, the handle had broken off and I was trapped! I had to text my friend and tell her \"I am locked inside the last stall...help!\" I wasn't the only victim to fall prey to the third stall. During the evening I freed two other women and warned others. As for the service, our waiter informed us 45 minutes after taking our order he had 'forgetting' what we ordered. He tried to make it up to us by giving us a free desert, but charged us for the desert after all! While the food was tasty, I don't think I'll go again or try the other locations- esp. after reading some reviews. Two stars!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place would not go back because I have eaten Mexican food all over the globe and the food here does not compare to any of those places. The service was good and their signature margarita was also good but the food my friend was not worth a trip back for me. Furthermore, it's quite pricey as well, considering , the experience was definitely not worth the bill."}
{"text":"Small restaurant on Yonge Street with cozy decor and dimly lit atmosphere. Came on a weekday night and it was nice and quiet. Nice sit down spot for Mexican food. 

Our server was friendly and very helpful, explaining and guiding one of our party members around their dietary restrictions.

Ordered the Al Pastor tacos- pork tenderloin, cilantro, grilled pineapple (entree sized), La Perla tacos - battered cod (entree sized) and a chicken tinga dish. Entree sized just means for $7 more you get 3 tacos instead of 2, plus rice and refried beans. Considering that most downtown taco joints charge $15 for 3 tacos, and this was around $18-19, it works out to be in the same price range.  All three dishes were spicy but delicious. The pork was not as tender as I expected it to be (still good though) but the battered cod was good."}
{"text":"Went there for work. Some of our food was great. I had fish which I don't usually do but it was really good. Others however didn't love their dish. The staff and servers were excellent."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and not very good. The \"classicos\" entrees are about $20 a plate. Tacos are ordered in twos and cost about $12 (no mixing and matching). 

The red snapper ceviche was very oniony and strange tasting.  Would not recommend.

I had to send lamb entree back because it was cold in the middle. Yikes. Service took care of it promptly and without question, so that was good.

Food needs to be rethought, better prepared, and more competitively priced as there are many superior Mexican food options in the city now."}
{"text":"Ceviche is good, and tacos as well. Margheritas could use some work - too much mix and the large just brings more ice. Server was good when he was around which wasn't often as he seemed quite busy. Might need to add some more staff. Fairly easy to get reservations so good for last minute bookings w groups."}
{"text":"Food was ok.
Avoid the bathroom. The carpet on the stairs going down is 50 years old. Smells like it's 100 years old. Like a wet dog.
Toilet bowls look like they haven't been cleaned in weeks ...Heavy yellow stripes. 
The crayons scribbled sign indicating baby change station in the hall had been edited to now read baby EXchange station. That's funny."}
{"text":"I have been to Milagro quite a few times and have always enjoyed the food and service. But last Sunday when I visited Milagro (Mercer) I had a rather annoying experience. I went with 3 other friends and at the end we decided to split the bill where some of us paid cash and then some paid by card. Judging from the server we felt he really was not too happy with the way the bill was split. And from the way things were unfolding we figured that he was worried about his tip. He mentioned the word \"tip\" almost 10 times in the 2 minutes he was trying to explain how the split works. BTW this is not our first time splitting a bill in a restaurant and its not rocket science. We had thought of paying for the bill, and then pay for the tip separately. Not knowing it he kept on mentioning the importance of tipping and how splitting the bill might reduce the tip amount. For a while we were rather frazzled not understanding why he was going on about the tip. This made him not have a reduced amount of tip but rather a bad experience of coming to Milagro. I have never ever seen a  server insist on a tip this many times. We are not from another world and I am willing to pay 15-20% tip based on the service, and insisting on tip is not service. Please advise your servers that this is not best customer service practice. But by judging of who the server was I think he might be the manager of the restaurant itself. I am not sure."}
{"text":"Epic Fail. Before you read any further let me warn you the food is bad. I mean really bad. I could spend a few lines telling you how terrible the service and operation is but really the food is so horrible that nothing else matters.

How does a place claiming to serve authentic Mexican food somehow screw up a burrito?? I mean c'mon we have hole-in-the-wall places that have perfected this! When you stuff your chicken burrito with mostly chunky hard pieces of iceberg lettuce something is wrong...very wrong. It's offensive that you think your patrons are stupid enough to buy into the fact that this is any kind of authentic Mexican food. It is not and it's embarrassing that this place even exists.

I honestly can't see it lasting long in the area serving up an experience as bad as the one I had. Not even kidding when I say Chipotle could smoke this place in terms of quality of food. Service IS horrible on top of the food that will most likely leave you spending many hours the next day getting acquainted with your closest ceramic bowl amigo. Steer clear of this place people it is that bad."}
{"text":"I've been there for brunch now and enjoyed both visits. Restaurant was quiet both times but both days also had lousy weather so may not be typical. Both times I've very much enjoyed the food, service has been good and appreciated the decor and music. I highly recommend their Mexican hot chocolate, my friend and I both thought it was the best we'd ever had. Huevos Milagro was a particular tasty and filling brunch dish.

I'll be back and hope to try out their dinner menu soon!"}
{"text":"I went here because they were having sangria specials. The sangria itself was not good. I don't know if this was supposed to be authentic, but it was very bland tasting and I was not impressed at all....

We decided to split a starter (as weren't very hungry and it was after 9:00pm). We wanted to get nachos, but the waiter said \"Nachos are too tex-mex for us\". I thought...O..K....so we settled on their quesadilla. It was alright, but again, kinda bland. I didn't appreciate the pretentious service we received either. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Been there twice and honestly I do not understand what people are so negative about. Each time the food was great, with decent portions and very tasty. Had a pork burrito once and the fish taco the other time. Both times excellent choices.
Service is efficient and courteous - it is a downtown venue hence they get a lot of business-people, so they are used to offering great service.
The prices are a bit on the ridiculous side - so beware, although I will be honest, the portions are decent to make you potentially forget that."}
{"text":"Don't believe all the negativity, it's all sour grapes.  This place has solid ratings on every other restaurant review site.     

Milagro is relatively authentic, higher end urban mexican faire.   Yes, I said authentic.  Don't give me this \"I lived in San Diego\" hipster silliness, the owners lived in Mexico city their whole lives before immigrating to Canada.

Yes, it's a bit pricey, but it's not a run-down dirt hole like most Mexican places are in Toronto.    A great addition to the scene."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from here. Irrespective of that issue, which I'll be discussing with public health shortly, I found the food bland, ill-prepared, expensive given the poor quality and service was inattentive, distracted and kind of non-existent.

Guacamole was bland. Chips were best part, so that tells you something. 

Fish tacos. Ugh. Soggy-ish fish. Flour tortillas (what?!) that were actually burnt from the grill. Fish was so bland and under-seasoned, and cabbage slaw was basically sweet vinegar coleslaw. Tomatoes were underripe (why? Why?????)

Nobody paid any attention to us, nor did they ask us how our meal was or notice that both of us ate  the fish out of the tortillas because they were too burned. 

If I hadn't had limited time with my friend I would've sent it back, but honestly if they screw it up so badly the first time why bother? It's just not a very good restaurant.

I will never, ever go back and I hope if I did get sick from there that nobody else did."}
{"text":"Great dinner and awesome margaritas :-)
I had been here for brunch too and Milagros didnt disappoint ."}
{"text":"Had a chance to try out Milagro on a few occasions.  I usually get the cheese enchiladas which are done very well and are accompanied by great sides (beans, salad, rice).  The nachos they give you before the meal are also very addictive!  They also make the guacamole for me without cilantro and it is perfection.

The staff is great and the atmosphere is also wonderful.  Only complaint is the prices which are above average for Mexican food especially for vegetarian dishes.  I will however be back on those special occasions when I crave a good Mexican meal."}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised by the other two reviews. I started the night looking for hearty Mexican comfort food, but ended up having a very inspiring, classy and memorable meal. I had the conchinita pibil ($18 on the menu, they charged me $21), which is pulled pork in orange and achiote marinade. The pickled habenero onions served with it made the dish standout. My meal was served on a small plate, but I was absolutely stuffed by the end.  The decor is surprising - pleasant, warm and very different from what the facade would suggest.

Prices are a bit on the high side: entrees range from approximately $15-24, which is ok for what I got. My mojito was delicious, but set me back $8 (and it wasn't that big). 

I can't speak for the experiences of the other two reviewers, but my servers were very pleasant and attentive. Maybe they let go of the offending ones?

Overall, a great meal. I would be happier if the mojitos didn't cost so much. They should really correct the prices on the menu though. I usually complain about these things but I didn't want $3 to spoil the nice meal I had."}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't know that Mexican food could be so expensive and taste so ordinary!  

My friend got a fish tacos...when it came, everyone at the table stared at how small the portion was.  It was kinda shocking that the restaurant would have the nerve to serve that.  My dish was just ok...nothing special...not memorable.

The service is ok and the taste is just ok.  Nothing special at all.  I would not recomend this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 1 star for the food and 1 star for the decor. We arrived here at the dinner hour and waited over half an hour for our drinks and over an hour for our food. I wanted to order more drinks and food, but I was worried how long those additional orders would take considering how long we'd already waited.   I don't know if our waitress was just overwhelmed or what but she failed to even notice that not all of us had napkins or enough glasses for water for our table. 

I realize that there were two concerts going on but, come on! It was beyond ridiculous! You guys aren't new to the restaurant business and this location is right by TIFF, the theatre district and the Rogers Centre. You should be able handle it! Truly disappointing. I will not be returning. 

If you don't mind waiting nearly two hours for your food and drinks and poor service Milagro is for you! Honestly I doubt I'd be even willing to waste my money on another location after this horrible experience."}
{"text":"The food was great!! The service, so friendly and helpful. We were at the very top area though and there was barely any moving space for our party. 
What was confusing (maybe because we had so many people) was that when we ordered and the food came , we were sure who's was who's.. There needs to be some type of organization and order..the patrons would be too occupied to remember ourselves."}
{"text":"¡Ay, ay, ay, no es bueno!

Keep in mind, I don't have a whole lot of experience with Mexican food.

We started with the fish tacos.  Not bad, a bit salty. 

Followed with the Filete Poblano which is a fancy name for three (nicely prepared) chunks of tenderloin that you wrap in tortilla shells with cream sauce and caramelized onions.  

Pescado Rodrigo which is grilled fish with cilantro, lime, olive oil and spicy potatoes.  The potatoes were soft and tasty.  
Fish was pretty good, the whole dish had a kick.

The dessert we ordered was the Trufa De Chocolate Maya, lava cake that the menu says comes with whipped vanilla cream, but ours came with something that resembled condensed milk.  The cake was good, chocolatey, warm and oozy.

Overall the food was ok.

As for service, the staff was attentive and polite.
However, I found a mistake on the bill when I got home.

And I was pretty irritated with the waiter regarding the drink specials.
There are giant signs advertising Margarita night.  
I chugged two of those down, they didn't tell me the special was for small ones, so I had to pay twice what I expected for  the two large margaritas.

The prices are way too high for a half-empty Mexican restaurant.

Glorified steak fajitas type things: $23.95
Fish with potatoes usually $20 which they overcharged us: $23 .95
2 small fish tacos $10.96
2 overly salty and icy margaritas $15.90 
Chocolate cake: $8.95

This meal cost way too much for what you got.
Dinner for two at a Mexican place for $100?!
I'm not a fan of empty restaurants (Even if it  was a Tuesday after work).
I'm pretty sure I won't come back. I could go for fries supreme right now."}
{"text":"The food here is real Mexican food, like the kind you find in Mexico City, not Tex Mex like you find in well...Texas. Or fast food restaurants like Taco Bell or Taco Time.  And real Mexican food isn't something that is easy to find in Toronto. That being said, I feel that Milagro is a bit expensive for what you're getting, especially if you've been to places where Mexican restaurants abound (i.e. Mexico and large US cities).  But I have accepted that being able to enjoy Mexican food in Toronto comes at a premium.

I've been to Milagro several times and I typically really enjoy the food, but I went there a few days ago (Apr 2011) and it wasn't as good as my previous experiences but I don't know if it was a one-off experience or a permanent change for the worse.

As usual though, the guacamole was really good and freshly made.  They use properly ripened avocado and diced onion and tomato.  I order it every time, even at $10 for an appetizer (at least they give you a lot).

The lamb barbacoa (entree) is usually tender and soft, and one of my favourite dishes, but I've ordered it more than once and I've noticed that it varies; sometimes it's saltier and drier than other times.  The lamb also has a pretty gamey flavour, so if you're not into that then you should steer clear of this dish.

The seafood enchilada was flavourful and as good as enchiladas get. The sauces that come on the enchiladas and other entrees are pretty tasty and authentic, as far as I know.  It comes with rice and refried beans.  The refried beans are really good.  The rice is on par with other Mexican-style rices I've had.

They also bring you freshly fried chips to the table with salsa, as a complimentary appetizer.  Both chips and salsa are consistently tasty.

The service was a bit slow for my liking, and this was at 7pm when the restaurant was only half full.  The server only came by our table frequently during the beginning of our meal, and was nowhere to be found when we were near finished and wanted our bill."}
{"text":"A quirky restaurant with a lot of potential!  Everyone is right on here in that it is not a cheap restaurant but if they could get service and food quality under control it could be amazing and well worth the price.

The frozen strawberry margarita lacked strawberry flavour, the over abundant amount of guacamole was good, the fish was dry but the accompanying salsa was excellent!  The side of refried beans were out of this world delicious so you can see what I mean by quality control."}
{"text":"When I went to La Cartina, I thought the tacos were good, until I walked into Milagros! It has some real stuffs and you realize that the tacos you had before with sour cream and so much lime were such a disaster ! Here you can eat really tacos that you can taste every single ingredient. I am truly impressed ! Best tacos outside of Mexico in Toronto !!! Confirmed with my Mexican friends!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Very tasty so no complaints there.

The service....not so good...

- Despite a reservation, at first they wanted to split our big group of 14 because it was Friday and they apparently couldn't move one small table and a few chairs to accommodate our bigger group. After some persistence they finally caved. The place was practically empty the entire night, so it turned out moving one table was no issue at all

- After we ordered our food, they couldn't remember who ordered what, so there was a bunch of confusion

- They didn't come to check on us often. Only a few of us were asked to top up for drinks, the rest were ignored

- The cheque was dropped with only half of the table knowing about it, and the bill wasn't split so the entire group of 14 had to figure out how to split it ourselves, which took quite a bit of time and left a bad taste in our mouths. And of course a forced 18% gratuity tip, even though the service didn't even deserve the accepted minimum of 15%

It's too bad really. If this place does takeout (do they?) I would totally get the food and completely skip the sit-down experience.

(update: I was there another time with a smaller group and the server that time was better. this was several months later. upgraded score!)"}
{"text":"Group of 14 people for dinner. Place is tight but the cozy. We ordered the platter which was a good choice. Steak dish was the best of all. Ordered all the deserts and chorizo was the beat. The rice pudding had sugar pieces and too sweet. Over all ok."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I've visited Milagro, and there is good reason for this. I think 3 stars for this place is way too generous.

We came here on a Wednesday night with reservations in a group of about 12 people. They started by telling us that there is a mandatory 18% tip for groups over 6. Do you know what that meant in this dive restaurant? You will NOT get good service. I waited approximately 20 minutes for my bottle of beer, when everyone else got their margaritas and I had to ask the waiter about it. 10 minutes later I finally get it. 

Strike 1 - 30 minute wait for 1 bottle of beer.

Strike 2 - THEY WOULD NOT DO ANY SUBSTITUTIONS ON THE MENU. One of our friends is allergic to dairy and they refused to leave cheese off anything. Are you kidding me?

Strike 3 - Insane wait we had for any of the food to come out. The resto was deserted. How does it take an hour for terrible Mexican food? It doesn't.

Strike 4 - He would not split our bills or give them separately. And gave us MAJOR attitude about it. We had to sit down as a group (who had just been drinking) and do the math on the bill.

Congrats on getting your 18% from us - you lost 12 customers in one night that will never be back again. Learn how to run a restaurant properly - hire friendly staff - and stop with your ridiculous policies."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time I will ever go to Milagro.  

We arrived well before our reservation and wasn't that busy.  It got busy much later, like 45 minutes later. 

We first ordered the sangria with fruits.  Very cheap on the fruit and the red wine was watered down immensely.  We first started with the tortilla chips and guacamole.  That was pretty good and probably the best part of our whole experience.  We actually ordered our dinner at the same time as our appetizers.  It has always been customary for servers to bring the main portion at least when you're done with your appetizer.  NOOOOOOO.  It was sent to our table not even five minutes into dipping into the guacamole.  

All of that lasted 45 minutes, including talking, sharing parts of our meals and dipping into the guacamole.  

We both ordered enchiladas and they were meh.  I'm pretty sure I asked for chicken but I got pork instead.  I didn't complain and ate it anyway.  

Our server ok but when it came time to getting our bill, she was nowhere to be found.  You would figure after you say that since you didn't want any dessert, the bill would come.  I would estimate that was another 15 minutes.

The overall ambiance was crap.  You figure if you're in a Latin restaurant they would have a latin experience with some tropical beats, or at the very least some Mana.  Our server was a latina.  The rest were a bunch of white folks who probably got the Latin experience by visiting Cancun.  

So yup, once again I've been disappointed by the experience of a Latin American resto here in Canada.  I think it's best just to visit holes in the wall with authentic cooking instead of being charged an arm and a leg for crap food and a even worst experience."}
{"text":"Overall, Milagro pretty good, with several clearly-marked vegetarian/vegan options.  I've been to the location near John St, but mostly I hit the Queen West locaish.  The atmosphere is cozy and pleasant; Mexcian music and decor. 

Really good:  the gaucamole is superior, and I also get a side of refried beans (yes, they're vegetarian) and salsa to dip the tortilla chips in.  That in itself is a tasty and filling meal.  

Really, really good:  the salad with mango and cucumber and some other stuff.....sounds \"meh\" but tastes \"yay!\"  Oh, and margaritas are all fab - they really know how to do booze there.  Even if you just go for chips and dip and booze, you'll be pleased.

Really bad:  the vegan main, which is essentially an oily, flavourless stirfry with giant potatoes - so random, eh?!

Really, really bad:  the service.  And I'm easy to please (that's what she said)."}
{"text":"Rating based on the bar experience. My friend and I didnt order food we tried two tequila flights the mezcal and clasico and we were told how to drink it which is helpful. The tequila here is the real stuff made of agave not mixed with corn syrup = no hangover. The bartender also helped us find our tequila based on what flavors we like and price range. He was friendly and educational. Had a good time. But wait... The margaritas are Ahhhhh-mazing. Got the normal lime flavor. Definitely a must try. Will be back."}
{"text":"We loved Milagro. We chose the pescado Rodrigo and the alambre with steak, at the server's recommendation. The tamarindo margarita was great. Everything was unbelievably tasty. Very salty but delicious. The service was great for the most part but our second order of tortillas never arrived; our server more or less abandoned us towards the end of our meal, but the food was so good that we will be back."}
{"text":"First time visit for me. I have to say that I was not at all impressed with Milagro Mercer Street.
When my friend and I arrived we were told to wait by the host as he had a conversation with a hostess. Not a great welcome.
We were seated on the patio, and all I can say was the service was sloooow. Like annoyingly slow. Why should anyone wait 15 minutes for chips and guacamole?
The entrees again took forever to arrive. I got the tacos and it was $12 for 2. Here's a hot tip - go to Kensington Market where most places have 5 tacos for $10.
Wait staff were super eager to clear our dishes but not eager to serve. Won't go back.
A very mediocre experience, no 'Milagros' here."}
{"text":"I eat here entirely too often, but I can't help myself. I live in the neighbourhood and have brought many friends for dinner (easy converts). There are a handful of vegetarian options but the more popular dishes are mostly meaty. I'm a vegetarian and generally stick with the cheese (panela) or vegan (avocado) burrito. 

The staff are all super friendly and are quick to offer recommendations to those who just can't decide. It get's busy on weekends to make a reservation in advance or go during the week (they have drink specials on some weekdays)

Be smart, order the guacamole. You won't regret it. Oh, and if you have room for dessert try the chocolate molten lava cake thing (don't recall the specific name) it's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Solid food, interesting decor, and decent specials get this place a 3.5. Most of their waiters and hosts are competent, but sometimes you get the odd person that doesn't seem to care about their job. I've been to this location a few times and it's mostly the proximity to my friends that have us coming back. The food is decent but there are better Mexican places if you're willing to venture further. 

Their burritos are delicious and will give you good value for your money. They have a taco special on Tuesdays and you can choose two for $8. I like their rosarito (not available with the special) mole and mixiote tacos. They're flavourful and not too heavy. They give refills for the chips that come with the guacamole. They have a wide selection of drinks, both alcoholic and not, as well. 

I really enjoy the flan for dessert. It's the most memorable part of the meal for me."}
{"text":"PERFECTION!!!!

Not only is the food to rave about (those tacos and margaritas are unbelievable) but so are the staff! 

I had my birthday dinner here a couple of weeks ago, and the servers and bartenders were exceptionally attentive, kind, and a delight! 

Highly recommend, thank you Milagro for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give it a 3.5 -- may return one day...


The good: 
free nachos with guacamole and salsa... this was REALLY tasty
i ordered the grilled fish (under the entrees)... i believe this was snapper... and it was really good. fish was well seasoned and cooked to perfection... comes with potatoes which were really good too

the OKAY:
seafood ceviche... i wish it was raw... it was cooked... flavour was pretty good but nothing special

not so good:
ordered their margarita and it wasn't the greatest... very coarsely grinded ice

service was really good at first... but then it got busier and went downhill from there. we had to wait an eternity to flag someone down when we wanted our bill..."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised at the the overall low rating for Milagro on Yonge. I didn't look on Yelp before I went. Decided to go here for a project (on Mexican cuisine).

We ordered 3 different tacos (2pc per order) - tacos adobados, tacos de carnita & tacos roasrito, ceviche de camaron (shrimp), an order of chips + guacamole. The owner was nice enough to provide me a sample of the chocolate moule sauce since I told him I was a culinary student. That was a big plus! 

I enjoyed the ceviche very much since seafood is my love. The balance between the flavours were great and the heat gradually built up. My friend totally devoured the guacamole. I still had some! Between the 3 tacos, I would say the rosarito was the best as it wasn't as dry as the other two. It was more exciting and I would go back for that one again and again. 

I don't really go for Mexican much but with this being my first one in ages, I enjoyed this!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I think the individuals comparing it to Taco Bell are completely jaded. I have my qualms with Milagro: the food is overpriced by around 20%, the drinks are overpriced by 50%, and the service at times is unbearably bad. That said, the food is good and authentic; definitely one of the better Mexican options in the downtown core. If the prices were dropped and the service improved, it would be a 5/5."}
{"text":"Ok. So I wanted to take my friend to El Catrin last night, however the latest reservation available was at 5:30 pm. My guest was only available around 7. We were still in the mood for good Mexican, so I took her to Milagro Cantina on Queen. Now, I have not been to Mexico yet but I am somewhat familiar with the culture and the food and had eaten Mexican food before. But not this good so far in Canada.  The drink list in this joint is really huge. All sorts of cocktails are available and tequila has a starring role in most of them. We almost ordered a bottle of Malbec but quickly came back to our senses and ordered a pitcher of Sangria gringa:  red wine, bourbon, mezcal and bitters. Who knew all these ingredients combined so well  and that the obtained concoction would be so refreshing? None of the ingredients overpowers the others and it went very well with the dishes we ordered. Now, this is a Mexican restaurant but ceviche, Peru's wonderful contribution to the culinary world is really well executed here. The large ceviche de pescado (snapper is the fish used here) was refreshing and filling. Probably one of the healthiest dishes around. The fish is cut in small pieces, marinated in lime juice and divinely mixed with diced mango, corn, red onion and cilantro. Estupendo!
Then, my guest ordered tacos rosarito: sauteed shrimp with sour cream,refried beans (the best I have had so far)salsa, and a side of very good rice(  but why peas and carrots in the rice? It does not need it.). My main was mole poblano. All I can say is.....  HOLY MOLE! That dish was so good. I had mole before but not this good. This is really a sauce made with  Mexican chocolate,spices and peppers. You get the heat from the peppers yet, at the same time, a wonderful dark chocolate sweetness. The chicken under the mole is tender and delicious. This dish too comes with rice and again.... what is the deal with  peas and carrots? This rice is awesome on its own.
People who know me are aware I lost weight partly by cutting on sweets but the dessert list holds some definite gems and we  did share not one but two of them.  A wonderful crème brûlée which showcases a brilliant use of cinnamon and a creamy, mellow texture,; and a Trufa Azteca, which is a Mexican chocolate cake with a creamy, gooey chocolate centre and a wonderful cinnamon sauce. The cake is made to order and is definitely worth it.
The chef here is definitely  an expert with chocolate. The same dark chocolate deliciousness is found here, minus the heat and I did not realize cinnamon goes so well with it. The desserts here are just sweet enough and a satisfying finish to a great meal. Despite a great choice in caffeinated drinks, we both opted for a simple espresso, which was good but honestly on the lukewarm side. If you order coffee, make sure to tell them  you want it at the right temperature.
This restaurant is pretty, convivial and funky. The decor is warm and cool paintings (which I suspect are for sale) are on the wall. The lighting at night, though is too low. It is a tad too dark which makes taking pictures next to impossible with a smartphone. 
The service while generally good, can be uneven. I liked the fact that we were not rushed to order and we did take a while to make up our minds. Despite the fact that the joint was jumping, the food did not take too long to arrive, and the sangria arrived really fast. However,once we have the food, we savour it and take our time. So, if you see that we are chatting, and not touching our food for five minutes, why ask us regularly if we are still working on... the tortillas? the ceviche? the sangria?  Really? Is there a race going on? But the staff was nevertheless friendly and helpful.
So, overall, a very good experience despite a couple of weaknesses. The food is of great quality  and well-prepared. Some may argue that the price is high (133 in total for the above, not including tip) but in my opinion, you get more than your money's worth and portions are reasonable. If they are not happy, they can always go to Chipotle, right?"}
{"text":"Came here to kick off my bachelorette party. We made a reservation for 8 p.m. but didn't get seated until 8:30. It was after 11 a.m. when the food arrived so that pretty much put a damper on the night. While the manager comp'd the meal because of the lack of service, it spoiled what was supposed to be a special night. Their excuse was that it was busier than normal, which really doesn't fly. It was a Saturday night and we had reservations. Should take more than three hours to get served in a restaurant. Honestly can't even remember the food."}
{"text":"My bf and I went here after City Chase; tired, exhausted and hungry. We thought Mexican food would be appropriate and Milagros was a place I have always wanted to try. There is a patio outside and we chose to sit there - the inside was very dark and I am not sure if it was more for atmosphere or because they were cheap. 

The menu appears to have typical Mexican dishes - for starters, we ordered the Nopales (Cactus and Tomato) and Refritos (the re-fried beans that have the consistency of mush and baby food.) They also provide crispy tortillas and salsa.

For something as exotic as cactus, I was very disappointed as it was soggy, tasteless and stringy. Initially, you might be thinking who would want to eat a prickly plant, but all thorns are removed and you end up with a green, soggy Twizzler.  

For main course, I had the Carnitas Panchos which was quite disappointing as well. It essentially was pulled pork placed in a mound with little sprinkles of onions and tomatoes and a side of warm tortilla. I think the name of the dishes evokes images of Mexican food you see in Travel/Food magazines which is a complete let down when what you really get is something you could have created yourself. Notwithstanding, it tasted good, but nothing extraordinary. My bf had some meat dish that was entirely forgettable, but for dessert, we both decided to try the Natilla de Cajeta which is essentially Milagros' version of a Mexican Crème Caramel. If you are not already full by your main course, then you certainly will with this. When I returned from the bathroom (which was also very dark), my bf had already started eating the dessert, which had turned into a loose pudding. It was like drinking thick chocolate which I am not a fan of, however, I know some people like that consistency. The good thing is that I did not taste the goat milk which is a top of the dessert.

All in all, maybe I would come here for drinks as I did see many tequila and booze options. The bill came out to be $89.00 for two including two glasses of wine and a beer - The search for good Mexican food will have to continue."}
{"text":"Cool place to look at, friendly staff. I am giving a 3 of 5 because I wanted to mix and match tacos and you couldn't. I settled on the adobo chicken tacos which were delicious. They had a tiny pineapple chunck and salsa verde which added the moisture. I am also dinging points because after I said I wanted tacos he said rice and beans or salad and didn't explain that it would be an extra cost. It was my fault for not asking, but partially his for not saying it was extra. I don't plan on going again"}
{"text":"Still some of the best authentic Mexican food I've had in the city, and I've been to a lot of them. Quality and taste is always consistent, and the staff are always pleasant. Standouts on the menu include the ceviches, guacamole, and the tacos. We always leave stuffed and happy, and always find ourselves craving it again. Not overpriced pretentious hipster crap like Grand Electric, and they also do both take out and delivery."}
{"text":"This place was a total surprise, the decor was absolutely beautiful; the burritos were awesome. We sat in the back which is pretty much in the kitchen, we casually chatted with the cooks, which was great, they shared some of their favourite points of interest in the restaurant including the most beautiful etch-a-sketch of the space drawn from the very seat I was sitting in then.

Also I can't get enough of their ceviche -the one with pineapple, shrimp and jicama   - it's so light and good I've been craving it plenty."}
{"text":"The food here was great. I had the street sandwich with pork , pineapple and slaw. I can't tell you how happy my mouth was! I also had the strawberry margarita....... Very good!!! Try their guacamole, it's so fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants - the flavors are so bright, fresh and authentic. Love their pulpo (octopus) ceviche (which unfortunately was not on the menu last time we visited).
The margarita on the rocks is nice and strong, though I cannot tell the difference between ones made with cheaper tequila vs premium...
Seafood is always fresh and very well prepared: taquitos la perla, tostadas Vallarta, tostadas la tun are all excellent. One of the meat dishes that I would recommend would be cochinita pibil (very tasty, although the mains are fairly large and better suited for sharing).
Their Mayan chocolate desert is made with dark chocolate and cinnamon cream - I like the dark chocolate, but I am not big fan of cinnamon (I guess you can ask them to skip on the cinnamon cream all together). 
Service is laid back and somewhat lacking, but the atmosphere is very nice, and family friendly. In combination with Mexican music and decor, it does remind me of lovely Puerto Vallarta vacations:) 
Again, compared to many other Mexican restaurants in TO, this place comes on top."}
{"text":"Yummm. This place makes me salivate even 4 days later. How could you not with the performance this place put on for my friend and I this past weekend - every single element was on point. 

I made reservations for Saturday night using the OpenTable extension on Yelp (via the mobile app) very convenient! We arrived about 15 minutes late for our reso, but it wasn't an issue, they swiftly made a couple of rearrangements and we were instantly seated on their upper floor which had a a nice breeze running through it due to the patio in the rear portion.

My buddy had been talking up this place, having come here several times before himself, so when deciding on dinner I jumped at the chance to give this spot a try. He mentioned that his regular chicken dish was incredible and the guacamole was second to none.

Shortly after being seated our server arrived and was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu based on our tastes and made several well versed menu recommendations for us to try. Without much hesitation we ordered the large guacamole to share and I had a Sangria Con Frutta (with fruit). Everything came to the table quickly and the quac was far and away the BEST I've had in ages. Well seasoned, thick but not chunky and a spectacular flavour. I would have been happy with this on its own as an entree!

The sangria was standard, not the best or worst, but a a nice light refreshing beverage to have to go along with the meal that would soon ensue. One of our servers entree recommendations (the Alambre) really stood out to both of us, like his sales pitch on it made me swallow my saliva twice, it sounds THAT good! We both opted for rib-eye alambre... until our server informed us that we could go 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 rib eye.... WHAT? SOLD... there was literally no hesitation on that!

After taking down 1/2 my beverage and killing the Guac our food arrived. Coming with rice and freshly made tortillas this cheese, onion, bell pepper, steak and shrimp melty mound of goodness, smelt and tasted delicious!!! My only minor complaint was that I felt the Rib-eye was a little light (not very much) while the shrimp were HUGE and were that type of cooked where they almost pop when you first bite into them... drool

I asked for hot sauce and they brought over a bottle of their in house made sauce which had some kick to it BUT I wanted FIRE. So our server disappeared again and emerged with a couple bowls of their habanero pepper sauce (made in house, and crushed not blended, so there was plenty of chunks). My friend had warned me about this stuff, saying he had dumped the bowl onto his meal last time and it made him hallucinate! BRING IT ON!

I dipped my DIY soft tacos in it and even sprinkled a little on each bite. it had some kick FOR SURE. But it was a flavourful heat not one with only fire and no taste. 

I could go on and on about this place but it's nearing lunch time and I'm salivating again recapping this for all of you, so I'll stop before I make a fool of myself.

Service, Food, Ambiance, Value and the GUAC  earn this place near full marks in my books. Pay them a visit - I triple dog dare you! ;)

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD:
- atmosphere: \"cellar chic\" - dim, but you can still see your dining companions and the menu
- the TACOS LA PERLA: the non-entree serving size comes with two tacos of crispy battered flaky red snapper topped with a bomb .com slaw. this slaw was so taste!! the taco was so fat you could barely close it up, me likey! flour tortilla tasted super fresh. the heat was perhaps distributed unevenly, so it only hit me near the end, whereas other people's mouths were all on fiyah! early on. loved this spicy kick.
- noise level: our group of 8 was seated in a quieter nook of the restaurant immediately across from the entrance, so we could enjoy the music but didn't need to shout to hear each other

THE BAD:
- service: it was a Friday evening so it took a while for the server to come around for our orders. even with all of our craned necks scoping out someone to come by, we didn't get any acknowledgement for forever. it took even longer for my drink to come (which I ordered along with my food). the server apologized for forgetting my order, focusing on all the food instead.
- margarita: my super delayed classic lime margarita. a lot of others at our table has ordered small frozen margaritas, so i knew how small the glass was. the frozen drinks were pretty chunky so i got one on the rocks. too many rocks, too little drink! the ice filled up 3/4 of the already tiny glass so i was not impressed, especially at $8.50 each. in hindsight i should have just let them forget my drink completely.


THE GREASE:
- a few of the adobado burritos, while hefty in serving size, were oozing grease. i can't decide if that's sexy or not. 

they do tell you upfront on the menu that an 18% auto gratuity for groups of 8 or more applies, and no separate cheques.

i now understand all the mixed reviews but i was so satisfied with my taco that i'll see past the shortcomings to try out more of the menu. just be sure to come on a night where you're not in a rush and not craving a margarita."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great flavours, good price and great to share.
The trio dip app was a great size
The antojito tostadas dons flora was my favourite, perfect spice and pickled onions amazing.
Tacos we got the Capital, Rosarito and Adobados all fantastic.

Only downside was the slack service. We had to ask for the bill 3 times and they seemed more eager to clear our table than bring us food.
Still a great night"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives: the food and the service.  It's clear that the food I ate here was made with a good amount of care and attention.  The guacamole was bursting with a ton of flavour although still very well balanced with the garlic, onion, chili pepper, cilantro, and lime all playing off of one another nicely.  The tacos I had were the Carnitas Los Panchos and they were nicely spiced and seasoned (although the salsa it came with was forgettable).  Service was also prompt and very friendly.

The one real drawback to this place are the prices.  The large guacamole appetizer (which came with corn chips) was basically a bowlful of the stuff and it cost $12.00 which is a little over the top.  And 2 tacos costing somewhere between $9.00 to $12.00 was also eyebrow raising.  

I still give this place a thumb's up but with these prices I won't exactly be a regular here.  It'll be a nice indulgence every now and then though."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews. Most of the food is tasty and I really enjoy eating here.

The mixed enchilada plate is great, as is the cochinita pibil. Salsas and guac are great. The tacos are pretty good but I would say not their strong suit -- for that, there are better taco places in the city. Service has generally been fine whenever I've been there.

Overall I like the food & ambience, and I think this is a solid choice for good Mexican."}
{"text":"Excellent meal tonight. Fast and attentive service. Good was excellent and really tasty. Had the tuna with the sauce on the side - which I was able to drizzle onto the tuna - amazing. So tasty. Tried some of my partner's rib-eye again wonderful flavour. Wasn't expecting much but turned out fantastic. Will be returning soon. Excellent."}
{"text":"Had my brothers birthday dinner at Milagro and we were all quite disappointed with the service and the food. I don't think we were the only ones. We waited well over 20 minutes to be asked for our drink orders. 10 minutes later those arrived. We ordered our food and while waiting we overheard another customer complaining about not receiving drinks. Once our food arrived the waitress said that she must not have put one of the items into computer and the kitchen was now closed, but she felt like I would have enough with two tacos!!!! What kitchen closes at 10?!?!? especially when the restaurant was full!!!!! We also asked for some hot sauce which we were charged for! each little container of hot sauce was 1.50 which was never communicated with us and...What Mexican restaurant charges for hot sauce!?!??!?!?!??! Server hardly came around, we were never a priority. We thought we could get some dessert but that was not available. we were able to order coffee, but don't ask for milk or sugar cause you'll never get it!!! overall insanely disappointed with service and the food was nothing to rave about i think id rather go to fat bastards  or zteca, you'll get more food and more flavor!"}
{"text":"I have lived in this neighbourhood for a number of years, and have been walking by Milagro for just as long.  After a depressing ballgame (least of which is because the Jays are in such a sad state right now!), we ended up going to Milagro due mostly to the unpredictable weather and not knowing if we could make it to another restaurant before getting dumped on.

As I'm looking through the reviews on Yelp now, I am noticing that many of the more negative reviews for Milagro are from Americans who, I believe, would have a better grasp on Mexican food -- because in my experience, the US kicks ass on Mexican food (and BBQ)!  Honestly, I haven't had anything in Toronto that would hold a candle to some of the Mexican (and BBQ) I've had in the States.

But back to our visit today... we should have known from the beginning....

The host was a hipster looking guy who appeared to be annoyed by the five of us showing up at 5pm for dinner.  After answering in the negative to a curt \"Reservations?\", he walked away without any other acknowledgement and just as we were considering leaving, he came back, but still didn't address us.  He seemed further annoyed when I asked, \"Is there a problem?\" and eventually sat us at the group table that is beside the bar and where they also keep their excess beer supply. 

It took quite a while before the server approached our table.  He finally came as we were, again, discussing the possibility of leaving and considering other options in the area.  I think he sensed that we were sour and he appeared to be attempting to bring some lightness to the table. 

We ordered drinks.  My friend's margarita and my sangria were delicious.  Sadly though, they were the best part of the meal.

DH and my friend's DH ordered the Alambre, the chicken and steak respectively, from the server's recommendation billed as a dish akin to fajitas.  My friend ordered some kind of burrito.  Their son ordered the quesadilla.  And I ordered the Atun Contramar, tuna with avocado, cucumber and soy/lime sauce, but asked to have it made without cucumber.

After taking our orders, the server returned to notify me that the kitchen was concerned that without the cucumber in the Atun Contramar, it would be a hunk of tuna on the plate and not much else and would I consider the tuna ceviche instead?  While I thought it was a strange alternate suggestion, I do like to trust resto staff to provide me good advice (especially as the server spoke highly of his own knowledge of the menu).  

Again, it took some time for the food to arrive and when it did, my dining companions were mostly 'meh' about their meals while I was WHOLLY disappointed.  If based on my meal alone, I would have rated this experience as one star.  The ceviche was ok enough, accompanied by... just wait for it... PREMIUM PLUS CRACKERS.  Crackers?  It was ok, but I felt fooled by the recommendation, especially at $17.50.  And when asked, I let the server know how I felt about it to which he responded, \"I can see how the large might be too much.\"

When we were ready to leave, it took some time for us to flag down the server who brought over the bill commenting, \"This is the best part of the meal\".  Haha... hilarious!  (Extreme sarcasm.  I was clearly unamused.)  I responded, \"I guess it depends on the perspective.\"

My final perspective?  Brutal.  I don't often get angry about a dining experience, but this was truly disappointing.

And the staff are dressed as though they are going out for a Sunday stroll in the park... straight after rolling out of bed.  Everything about this place, from the weathered menus to the lack of presentation and pride in the quality of their dishes, seem to say, \"We don't care about our clientele.\""}
{"text":"The one on Queen is better.  We went here for brunch using our Travelzoo voucher.

It's alright, I had the barbacoa enchilada.  I'd go here again, but not itching for it."}
{"text":"I had amazingly friendly service there quite a few times. Occasionally the service is slow because it can get pretty busy during peak hours. It's almost always loud so if you go in there expecting noise and being pleasantly surprised that it happens to be quiet, it's better than expecting the opposite. 

Lots of food on the menu is delicious. I especially love their cucumber margaritas and cerviches de cameron. Don't expect to pay \"fast food\" prices because you aren't getting \"fast food\" quality. I love watching the kitchen when I sit at the back. They work hard and they make great food.

When I can't think of where to go for dinner, Milagro's is often my default."}
{"text":"This past weekend I had the pleasure of visiting Milagro for a late lunch with my husband and two friends who live in the Toronto area but spent most of their lives in Mexico and highly recommended this place as a very authentic Mexican dining experience. I can see why! The food was excellent and we all left fully satisfied from our meal. My husband ordered the Mixiote and I ordered the Cochinita Pibil. We were both happy with our choices. My one critique is that I wish they had brought out more meat of what we ordered. For example, my husband ordered Mixiote, but he only received about 2 tacos worth of meat, and a plate full of rice and beans etc... I received just a little bit more Cochinita than he received if Mixiote. Despite that one complaint, everything tasted excellent. We ordered guacamole, micheladas, churros, and café de olla. The Cafe de olla was awesome. I highly recommend it. I don't understand why some people are complaining about the ambiance of Millagro... it was actually really nice inside of this restaurant! The decor gave off a cool Mexican vibe. There were maps of Mexico City and various parts of Mexico on the walls of the entry way and I thought that was interesting. Our waitress was very kind and attentive to our table as well. No complaints other than the one mentioned above. I would definitely return here, and recommend this place to anyone looking for a taste of Mexico."}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time on Saturday. I was excited to look at the menu and see what good food they had. I had the seafood tostada which was soooooo spicy. I mean there were pieces of green jalapeños all over it. The taste was good but too hot for my taste. My husband got the chicken chipotle burrito and there was a huge chipotle pepper right in the middle of his burrito. I also had the enchiladas suizas and they were not bad but also a bit plain. The service was ok and our waitress was pretty attentive. I've had better Mexican food in less expensive places. I personally wouldn't dine here again."}
{"text":"Well I've been back twice since my first review and I am enamored.  I've tried two other dishes, the tinga de pollo (chipotle chicken and tomato) and the cochinita pibil (pulled pork in achiote), and these along with the lamb barbacoa are simply stunning flavour combinations.  I love simple food with genius flavour, and Milagro Cantinas provides this in abundance."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner with a few colleagues from work and we all loved it. A good option for groups is the cantina platter, which includes a little bit of everything on the menu, more than generous portions and endless complimentary tortillas. I tried the pollo con mole and the cochinita pibil with pico de gallo, beans, rice and guacamole and each and every one of the combinations were delicious.

The extra star goes for the delicious Margarita: I ordered the fruity strawberry margarita and it was salty, flavourful, perfect - hadn't had good margaritas like this one in a while and it was the highlight of my dinner!

Come here if you wanna taste good Mexican food in a nice / informal place."}
{"text":"Two possibilities:
1. Real Mexican Food.
2. A whole bunch of vectors for their yummy guacamole.
Either way, five stars."}
{"text":"Ambiance here was great.  Love the candlelight and the rustic tables. Their menu had quite a bit to choose from.  It was a pretty descent Mexican food, and from what I remember, Milgaro puts a lot of emphasis  with presentation with all their dishes.  Can't go wrong with solid Margaritas and service here was adequate.  Overall, a solid 3 stars and I'd dine here again when I return back to Toronto!

Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! Everything is well seasoned and flavorful! The ambiance is casual! Come early if you want to sit in the patio. We were the second couple there at 5pm and by 530 the place was packed! 

The only thing I can say is the prices are crazy high for Mexican food! Looks like you pay for eating Mexican food in Toronto! Lol 

The piña colada was absolutely terrible and overpriced. It was not even frozen :-("}
{"text":"Delicious, and the food seems authentic (not that I've been to Mexico.) Our waiter was very friendly; it just probably isn't the best choice if you're in a rush. That's not the style of service it is. (Saying that, members of our party had to dash and the kitchen rushed their food, so it was all good.) Overall, we were impressed."}
{"text":"Meh...as in meh-xpensive and meh-xican (not very mexican)...

I've eaten there before.

Had brunch there recently with the kids.  There is a kids menu, and while the staff new of its existence they didn't know what was on it and what was on it was not quite available, and the drinks that were supposed to be included in the kids menu were added to our bill until we asked that they be removed.

Service was friendly although a tad clueless as I said already and they don't seem to know much about serving families.  My eggs were ordered \"over easy\" and came \"sunny side up\".  Whatever.  Ther were also fried in bacon fat a bit heavy and salty-tasting but again, whatever.  Wife's scrambled eggs were disgusting, brown and overcooked to total dryness, also probably in bacon fat.  GROSS.

Also, 2 half pieces of bacon is actually only 1 full piecs, and 1 piece of bacon is not enough.

The only absolutely inexcusable thing there is the guacamole, which is all wrong, both in texture and taste.  Do you guys put mayo in there or something?  $11 guac should be, you know, good.  Let me tell you how to make it, it ain't hard:  Avocado, don't mash it too much! Lime, tomato, onion (not too much!), salt and cilantro.  That's IT, it's hard to do badly, but you manage to blend it like it's a margarita. EW is all I could say.  ON the other hand, your fresh salsa was very good.

Brunch for 2 adults and 2 kids, wth a side of guac ended up being over $60.  That's overpriced unless it's very good, and it wasnt.  Actually going over this review I realize 2 stars is too much, so I'm going back to change to 1 star and I'm not coming back here unless it's for beers or margaritas and just chips and salsa.

If you want good Mexican food there are more and more places opening up, Milagro will have to step up it's game once Torontonians get exposed to good Mexican food.  (Try the breakfast at Tacos El Asador.  No bacon but the BEST breakfast in town, for less than $7.)"}
{"text":"Surprised there's a decent Mexican restaurant in downtown Toronto.

Came on a Thursday night with s large group.  Parking was horrific, but luckily food and service was really good.

Good variety of tacos, chips, burritos, enchiladas, Mole chicken, etc..  Also nice selection of desserts..churros, flan, and cheesecake.

4 stars."}
{"text":"Waiter was super cheery and nice- he gave us some ideas on where to hang out - since we were from out of town

food was excellent- i had a chicken enchalada - the double refried beans were AWESOME! my mom and girlfriend had shrimp taco with some salsa. It is aparently the most popular thing on the menu-  they both like it. 

Decore is fun, and bathrooms are way downstairs. If i visit toronto anytime soon- id definitly go back."}
{"text":"This isn't authentic Mexican food, but for a Canadian who enjoys chips and guac and things wrapped in tortilla (without beans) it is A-ok!

I was there with a group of like 10 people on friday. 3 of us arrived early and ordered drinks. The waitress forgot to bring mine! Then brought the wrong one, and then finally my drink arrived (without an apology) But she wasn't rude. I think the place was understaffed. At one point a bartender brought me my drink. The waitress was quite friendly, but I think she was overwhelmed and so the service was very very slow. 

The red sangria was meh. The Margarita was better, but not amazing. 
The gauc was delicious and I loved the chips!
I shared with my friend:
 1. the mixed seafood ceviche - yummy! a nice refreshing dish. we had the small, which was huge.  I appreciate that the waitress told us it would be big enough for both of us when we were going to order the large.

2. Tuna tostada - this was my least favourite, but it was still good. The spicy mayo was really really spicy. But the menu does warn that the food is spicy. I don't mind spice, I like it. To me, this dish didn't need it though and i found it to interfere with the falvour of he tuna and avocado. 

3. The fish taco - This was good. Not fishy, a bit spicy. It would have been better if the toppings and sauce were more evenly spread, but at that point I was too tipsy to think to fix it myself. 

I can't comment on the prices because we split the bill up 10 ways and it worked out reasonably well. 

Oh yeah, they don't split the bill on a large group and they add an 18% auto grat. Perhaps this contributed to the slowness of our server...

I think I'll return and enjoy some more non authentic Mexican food.  To be honest, I don't love authentic Mexican!"}
{"text":"I used opentable to get a reservation for 3 at this restaurant, and our party was left pretty satisfied!

The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu items, providing a breakdown of signature cocktails and what the best selling menu items were. I ended up getting a chicken burrito after the server had stated they are quite large and enough to be a meal on their own (she was right!). My friend ordered the table a guacamole, and all of us agreed that it was quite tasty & fresh.

They carry Spearhead on tap. I enjoyed my Hawaiian Pale Ale ($5.50 half pint).

Our service was just attentive enough, with frequent refills. Our server was especially friendly, so we'd come back."}
{"text":"Made reservations to come here for my late birthday dinner with my two friends and we were not disappointed. We originally picked this location solely on the fact that it is steps from The Second City comedy club, but the food ended up being amazing. We orders the queso cheese dip with chorizo - absolutely amazing! Two of us ordered enchilada plates and the portion size was huge. My other friend ordered tacos which literally only came with no tacos and no sides.... which as kind of underwhelming considering the price was around $14. We also ordered a round of pina colodas which we found were extremely icy (not blended well), which made them hard to drink and a round of margaritas which were delish. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible, and the food wasn't great either... Especially for the price! I've lived in California and Florida and have been to Mexico 3 times, so I've had amazing Mexican food in my life and I feel I have a very fair evaluation. The host was the only semi-pleasant part of the experience. We went in after walking by, and he let us eat even though we didn't have a reservation. I was kinda surprised that a Mexican restaurant would have reservations to be frank. 

The server was cold, short, and refused to switch out my chicken taco tortillas from corn to flour stating \"the chef won't make them that way\". After getting the tacos, I realized that there was no physical reason this couldn't be done. Rather, it was a snobby response to my taste. 

I didn't eat much of my meal, and when I was done I asked the server if I could get a to-go box. I had one taco and the \"majority\" of my rice and beans left on my plate to take home. The next day when I opened the box, I noticed that I only had one taco (missing the avocado that was on it) and no rice and beans. So, I ended up paying like $14 (plus tax and tip) for one small taco and a few bits of my sides. I don't believe a server should ever determine what you do and do not want. 

It took us \"literally\" 20 minutes to get the server's attention for the bill after all that.

My partner and I decided to try it out again (crazy i know) because it's right across the street. We got the tortilla soup. Horrible! And of course, another cold server!

They seem to be trying to give this vibe that they're upscale Mexican food. Horribly executed! They've forgotten the basics, good food and good service!

I actually wrote an email to Milagro about my concerns over a month ago. I never heard anything back. :/"}
{"text":"The menu looked great and the location and atmosphere worked really well. I went on  a Friday night and it was full and busy.

But I've had much better Mexican cuisine at other places such as Playa Cabana and El Trompo. 

The sangria was great but if you want amazing food that will blow your mind, this isn't the place for that. Very pricey average food."}
{"text":"We went for Winterlicious $23 lunch menu. I had the Coctel Campechano for the appetizer, the Enchiladas Oaxaqueñas for the main, and for dessert the
Crema de Choclate. The Coctel Campechano was like eating a bowl full of salsa with shrimp and squid by itself. There was no chips to eat it with or cut the strong vinagar. The main tasted burnt and charred. I really wanted the Cheese Flan but they had already run out, so had to go with the chocolate mousse. I'd rather go to Taco Bell, cheaper and more flavourful. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We ate here because we had one of the \"groupon\" type coupons to try it. We were a little concerned, based on all the other reviews. 
But really, it was awesome, and we'll happily go back again!
Our server was really friendly, and gave us some great recommendations to order.
Our food was really good, much more like traditional Mexican food than other places.  My husband's pork dish seemed to have the \"spice packet\" still in it, which was a little gross looking, but they immediately made him a fresh dish, which was really nice.
It looks like they have drink specials some nights of the week (margaritas!), so we'll have to check those out sometime soon too."}
{"text":"I had a cucumber margarita and the shrimp taco.  It was delicious and I loved the decor.  It reminded me of Merida.  Would definitely return (and will sit in the rooftop patio next time)!"}
{"text":"If you have 2 hours to spend during lunch, go here.

Here's how it'll go down:
First three people will get their food 40 minutes after ordering.
The next person will get his food 10 minutes after that.
The other 2 will get their food about 15 minutes after.

If you like to wait for others' food to arrive while your food gets cold, you should go here.

Also, if you enjoy food swimming in a soup of salsa then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We had a good experience here! I often find I have to be craving Mexican food to truly enjoy it, but I was proved wrong tonight.  The food was good but not everything was equally as awesome.

To start we had guacamole.  I would give it 2.5-3 stars.  It was really fresh and chunky but I like mine to have a bit more kick, with more cilantro, wine and onion.  I also had a large strawberry margarita. Again, 3 stars. It was good but not mind blowing, although I'm not the hugest margarita fan so I should probably stop ordering them and being disappointed.

The WINNER - tacos al pastor. SO GOOD. The combination of flavours was just amazing.  We really, really enjoyed those.  In fact, I wish we had just eaten those for dinner.  Also, the rojas enchiladas were GREAT and came with great Mexican rice and beans.  Those two items really pushed this review into the 4 star world.

We also ordered the tingas burrito and my boyfriend said it was pretty boring.  We never got to really eat it and wrapped it up but I would not go for that burrito - go for the tacos al pastor and enchiladas!  

Also, a guy beside had enchiladas mole and he didn't like them - he said they were \"too chocolatey\".  

Overall, we had a great time and will be back to try some more items and definitely those tacos al pastor -- total winner!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am incredibly impressed with this spot. 

Friendly service and GREAT food. I ordered the tostadas de mariscos and the Hubster ordered beef tacos. They gave me the option of making mine entree size, which means an extra tostada and refrained beans and rice. When I got my food, I realized that I had made a horrible mistake. This was WAAY too much food. There were three large tostadas on a big plate. 2 would have easily sufficed. It was exactly what I wanted... basically ceviche on top of fresh guacamole on crispy tortillas. It was topped with pickled red onions which were too salty, so I just took them off. The chef dropped off the plate and said \"Please finish the whole thing\", a joke since my eyes probably went really really wide. These were DELICIOUS. I'm craving them right now.

The Hubster really enjoyed his beef tacos, which were a reasonable amount of food. He was able to help me with my dinner, which he also thought was incredibly delicious. 

We left incredibly full and satisfied. We'll definitely be back again. It was a little pricey, but the food and service was just fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to come here but found the food so-so and a little but too stodgy. Our kids were with us (11 and 7) and the kids portions were way too big and didn't quite hit the mark. Ok but a bit disappointing although the king size margaritas were great (we only had one each in case you're worrying)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband, my parents and my brother. We all had something different and everything was good. I had the Tacos Rosarito with shrimp, avocado, and crema. It was great. My Dad had the Pollo con Mole. He said the mole was excellent - spicy and rich, a complex flavor. My husband had the barbacoa burrito and he said it was excellent. My Mom had the fish tacos and \"it was so good I couldn't believe it.\" My brother had the vegetarian burrito. Service was a little slow but since the tortillas were made fresh, I can excuse that a bit. The wait staff wear blue and white plaid shirts which is a little odd for a Mexican restaurant but whatever.

Tip: Free wifi available, just ask for the password!"}
{"text":"Food - The portion sizes here are large and enough to take home to eat the next day.  I ordered the snapper ceviche which had just the right amount of cilantro.  I'm a big ceviche fan and was impressed with this dish.  The mole pablano was good and really filling.  Margaritas were tasty and had a decent amount of alcohol.  

The staff were friendly but service was a bit slow considering it wasn't too busy.  It's a cozy place and I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Who charges for hot sauce at a Mexican place?  

We walked in on a rainy wednesday night, the place was deserted and they asked if we had a reservation (first sign to get out of their) - we were seated in a booth that needed some TLC - hint you could see the 'foam' through the 'leather' (second sign).  

I stuck with a beer which was the best part of the meal... The guacamole we shared came with ample chips - which was nice, but the fish tacos were just meh.  Our cheque for four with one pitcher of sangira, one beer, one guacamole and 3 mains came to over 150 - which was wild... this place is way to expensive for the quality and the atmosphere..."}
{"text":"This place SEEMS like it would be good, however the food was below average and the service sub par.

My wife's food was lukewarm and lacked flavour.  The cheese inside her cheese enchiladas tasted more like paneer.  My $16 chicken tacos weren't good at all either.  We ordered the ceviche as an appetizer and it came without any chips.  Can I get a WTF?? Just a single lone Saltine.  There wasn't a lot of fish in it either.

On top of all this, it was incredibly expensive.  $100 with tip for two (with 3 drinks).

If you went to Playa Cabana first, you're gonna have a bad time.  

TL;DR:  Go to Playa Cabana instead."}
{"text":"I, like Rafi N. have not eaten out at many Mexican restaurants (at least not in Toronto).

I found myself at Milagro's as the first stop of Dishcrawl King Street Part 1 of 2.  

The pros:

Friendly service
Complimentary Pitcher of Sangria
Good selection of cocktails
Scotch Bonnet Hot Sauce (yowsers!)
Very tender lamb

The cons:

A very powdery tasting tortilla?  They were warm, but the texture was just off for me.  
A very bland pulled pork, also not tender.
The food was barely warm.  Verdict - it (as well as the tortillas) had been sitting out for awhile.  

Considering that Dishcrawl is an opportunity to showcase your restaurant, I felt that Milagro's disappointed.  I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The server tricked us getting Nachos making us think it was free. It turned out to be $8.5+tax+tips, not cool!!"}
{"text":"Had a decent night here because of the good company at our table, but aside from the ok margarita (one of them, anyway), this restaurant doesn't have anything to recommend it. It feels like a forgotten restaurant of an older Toronto. 

The first margarita was good. Everyone had singles, and we followed up with a pitcher of margs for the second round. Our first glasses were cleared, so we were brought new ones. My second glass had a sugar rim - gross. My partner had a salt one (not sure about the others at the table, I tried to be discrete about getting mine replaced with a salt one - the drink was just poured into the new glass).

The service was friendly, but abominably slow, despite the fact that this was not a very busy night and there seemed to be plenty of staff. The bowl of chips brought with the large guac was tiny, and we had to wait forever for a re-up on the chips (asked twice). Chips tasted somewhat stale (the thick, lardy kind), guac was just decent, nothing special (bland).

The queso fundido wasn't creamy, just pizza cheese melted in a small cast-iron dish.

I had the conchinita pibil (pulled pork), which came with a refried beans, side tortillas and pickled onions. Onions were good, though not very spicy, the meat and beans were boring and bland.

I ate half and asked for the rest to take home (praying they would bring me the containers myself, since I knew it would take forever). Most of the other plates and glasses had been cleared away on a previous round. When the service assistant came back to clear the rest, I reminded them I wanted to take mine home. They were all \"yes, yes, of course, of course,\" and picked up my plate. Another person had ordered side pickles, which were unfinished and still on the table, so I picked up a single jalapeño from that bowl - by the stem, mind you - and added it to my plate. Then the server reached for the rest of the unfinished pickles bowl, turned it over and just dumped all of it on my plate (carrots, onions) without asking me. I actually like these things, and trusted the person who'd ordered these not to have done anything strange to them, so just smiled along and didn't make any kind of fuss.

But then...  with my plate in hand, the server proceeded to put SOMEONE ELSE'S USED CUTLERY on my plate. It wasn't a question of confusion - this was the cutlery sitting in front of someone else, opposite from me. I'm not the kind of person who freaks out in principle over this kind of thing (and it was my partner's cutlery), but I was shocked that a person working in a restaurant would do this, and wondered what kinds of procedures might happen in the kitchen to fresh and take-home food. The leftovers were wrapped up and brought out in a giant brown shopping bag. Once we left, I ditched the whole into a Toronto trash bin.

Overpriced for all of that, too. Just under $300, before tax, for 6 people. The furniture was unbearable as well - too-soft couches, too low for the table, that slid all over the floor."}
{"text":"Not a lot of good things to say about this place unfortunately. Mediocre food that is very overpriced. Service wasn't anything to write home about either. We have tried numerous Mexican places in and around the city that are much much better."}
{"text":"Pros: The guacamole is excellent. The chips are alright. Service was very good. 

Cons: I had the Alambre with pan seared rib eye and smoked bacon.  Unfortunately, 1/3 of it was onion strips, the peppers were overcooked to the point of complete limpness and there was way too much oil. It was an oily mess.  So disappointing!  

Also, they don't split cheques - it's right on the menu."}
{"text":"Negative:
I agree with the other reviewers ... the service here was bad. When our server came over, it seemed as though he'd rather be talking to somebody else than take our order. Almost as though we were bothering him.

On top of that, they have people hovering around and clearing tables--often without asking if you're finished. Totally bizarre--like they're all lacking in social skills or something.

The food was okay. Nice, but not really that flavourful.

Positive:
Upstairs, after dinner, we were treated to a very knowledgeable bartender who introduced and gave detailed tasting notes on each of the tequila shots we ordered."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a great experience here. There is nothing like a great Chimichanga, or Ensalada. For me I was looking for the comfort of regular Maxican food. The menu looked foreign to me. Maybe I have been away from SoCal for too long. Somehow the Mexican food in this place was lost to nouveau-Mexican. Perhaps?

An extra star for the free chips and salsa. It always drives me crazy when resto's charge more for that. This bit helps the authentic claims.

While I liked the new decor and lighting, the new owners have taken down the sound baffles and the restaurant is terribly loud... which drives me crazy when I am trying to have a nice dinner chat.

Una cerveza, por favor! (If I remember correctly they had Dos-Equis)

I might have to try it out again in 2010 'cause I really do like Mexican."}
{"text":"Everything is mediocre here. Not the worst food but certainly not worth the bill at the end of the night. That's the biggest comment. No wow factor. Mojitos are sub par (had better on king street) and food is ok. Unimpressed with tacos (although a variety) the burrito was good. I guess after dining at the great Mexican rest in the distiller district. It was hard not to compare...better places in city.

Did give an extra star for service. They are attentive and speedy !"}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the Rosario tacos and they were delicious! Great waiters, friendly, good service. Love the vibes and will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Kinda funny that all 3 Toronto locations of Milagro currently have a 3* rating. I'd give it 3.5* really. The atmosphere was really cool, the server was friendly, and I kind of want to try their cocktails. My enchiladas were pretty good too. Why is it so hard to find enchiladas in the GTA by the way? I had the trio so I got to try 3 different kinds. Including mole. Why is it so hard to find mole in the GTA by the way?!

Anyways, I just found this place weirdly expensive. It wasn't exactly fine dining. If I'm spending as much as we did, I'm probably going somewhere else but I would probably come back because there were certainly a few things I still want to try."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. 

I will admit I wanted to leave the second I walked inside to a non AC packed place on a Friday evening. 

We both had the fish tacos and they are not the Snapper versions they boast on their online menu but cod. 

All of their other snapper dishes have also been replaced by alternatives with a lower food cost. 

The fish taco itself was not very good except for the fact that it had a little kick. With vastly superior alternatives in driving distance I will never been returning for a fish taco or to swelter in the heat. 

While I was not a fan of the taco the other in my party did like it but that may just be due to lack of quality comparables in Toronto and Mexico."}
{"text":"Went as a group. Loved the food and the service. 4 stars because it's not very baby friendly. But they were still very accommodating for us."}
{"text":"Every time I go here (by other peoples choices), I think or hope it will be better than the last time. It never is, but this experience was too bad to not post about. 

I met 3 girlfriends here for dinner on a Saturday night at 8pm. We had a reservation. Sat down, asked for sparkling water they brought flat. Fine no big deal.

We order drinks and it takes 20 mins to get them, and only 2 came out at a time. 

No one took our food order for even longer. Waiter to waiter would serve us, the entire flow of the meal felt off. Food came out at weird times, some of us were missing cutlery, just one shitty thing after the next. 3/4 of us hated our meals mine was just OKAY but I only ate half of it. (I RARELY ever have leftovers... so that says something.)

At the end of the meal, they asked us if we wanted separate bills. We said sure, if it's not too hard - we don't mind just figuring it our on our own. Sure enough, they split the bills and messed that up too. 

The waiter asked how I liked my meal (when he said i barely touched it) I said honestly, it wasn't so great - the dish tasted off. His response was \"oh next time try [this dish], it's much better.\" Hate to break it to you, but there will not be a next time.

The icing on the cake, was when we noticed a mouse trap sticking out from under our table. I understand that some restaurants do get mice, but it shouldn't be something you have to think about while you're eating your meal. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing special, basic Mexican food.   I got fish tacos and my friend got enchiladas. Every night they have different specials and that night it was half off on wine bottles.  Service was quite slow, but we eventually got our bill and they forgot to put the discount and charged the full bottle. We only noticed after paying so we had to wait for them to do the correction."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and unfortunately, the recent two occasions have been very bad.  So here goes so it's not all about the restaurant that is a bad review.

Food: 1/5, this is the main reason behind the 1star.  The first time, I got something cochina for Sunday brunch and second time the abadabo burrito. They were both tasty at the time but I got sick BOTH times. And I wasn't the only one in my party that got sick and we had different dishes.  I wonder if they use bad ingredients or there is something else.

Service: 2/5, not as great for a sit down. Not as attentive with waters or checking in. They just bring food and come for payment

Ambience: 3/5, ok seating and large place. There is a slight odd scent though 

Price: 2/5, for getting sick, not sure $20 per person is worth it..."}
{"text":"It's not authentic Mexican by far, but for what it is, it's not bad. (For reference, I was raised in Southern California and lived for several years just a stones throw from the Mexican border -- if there's one thing I often crave, it's Mexican food, which Toronto sorely lacks). 

I visited Milagro with three other school chums, hoping to catch up on gossip over carby food and sangria. Milagro definitely didn't disappoint. First, the sangria we ordered was quite delicious -- chock-full of big hunks of fruit, and packed a fairly boozy punch. Unfortunately the pitcher had a huge amount of ice, so it didn't yield as many glasses per pitcher as one would expect. 

The guacamole was quite good -- the texture was smooth, rather than chunky (which I prefer). And the chips were fresh, if a little salty.

Since I was looking to pollute my body with fatty food, I chose the enchiladas rojos, which is about as non-Mexican Mexican food as one can get. Really dug the fact that they used Queso Panela (a semi-firm cheese that reminds me of paneer) rather than the typical Monterey Jack that one finds at usual Tex Mex places. The sauce was nicely spicy, and I really liked the accompanying black beans. Everything was served blazing hot and fresh out of the oven. 

For dessert, my companions and I split the Natilla de Cajeta, which was a thick caramel with a brulee'd sugar top. Too sweet. Very rich. I could only stand one bite, preferring my cappuccino with caramel instead. A better ending to such a rich meal. 

Service was great -- quite attentive, but the noise level in the restaurant made it really difficult to hear what the soft-spoken server was saying. On the plus side, Milagro takes reservations online through OpenTable.

Like I said, not the greatest Mexican food, but far better than La Mexicana or, y'know, your typical greasy spoon Tex Mex joint. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Milagro is a festive, fun, south of the southern border restaurant.
They have very limited vegetarian menu - they can make their variety of enchiladas vegetarian or vegan, &, they are simply delightful creations. 
Their lava cake is one of the best in Toronto. 
They are very busy so call ahead & make a reservation."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me. I'm not sure what's Spanish or Mexican about this place except for maybe the name and food. It's more of a lowbrow roadhouse a la Tijuana."}
{"text":"No. Our booth seemed to be falling apart and was put back together with tape. Everything is overpriced PLUS they charge extra for hot sauce. Sangria was just sweetened red wine I don't even really know what was in there. I guess this is an ok place for the area but quality is sub par."}
{"text":"Won't go back. 

Service: attentive 
Food: tasteless
Decor : pretty 
Order: Summerliciois menu
Watermelon soup: a room temperature non appetizing amalgam of chopped tomatoes , cucumbers, and onions in crushed watermelon. 
Salmon attempt at ceviche: tasteless.
Lamb entree: pretty presentation in a banana leaf cone. The lamb was stewed to perfection, completely tender. But unfortunately very heady and tasted Ethiopian and not Mexican. The side of beans in a taco shell was mushy and disgusting.
Dessert: mango mousse. Raw mangoes (the mouse was tart) puréed with cream that has collapsed- is not mousse. 
Caramel tart: meh.

Can't remember being this disappointed with a meal :("}
{"text":"mexican food doesnt really vibe in a stuffy restaurant atmosphere as well as it does in a take out counter, a greasy mom and pop place, a beach patio, or a cool punk bar. 

the food itself was pretty good! i liked everything i had. but didnt blow me away for the price thats for sure. 

would definitely go to la carnita or mexitaco anyday before this place. 

overall it was decent and i dont think anyone would have a bad meal here. there's just no reason to spend this much money on mexican food."}
{"text":"Once you get past the host stand, this restaurant provides a great atmosphere, wonderful food, and tremendous service by the waiters.
I'm not sure what it is, but twice when I have gone to Milagro, the hosts are extremely condescending. They ask for a reservation (understandable), but have each time when said we didn't have one, the following happens: 
Pursed lips, an affected expression and \"Oooooo you...don't? Well. I mean. It's packed in here. I mean....I guess... you could sit at the bar?\"

We sat at the bar. 

Our Venezuelan bartender was attentive, funny, and provided great service. The food was delicious. We had the Tinga (amazing, seafood plate and shrimp tacos). My friends and I had a great time with him, and look forward to seeing him again. 

We'll head right past the host stand and straight to the bar next time. ;) 

As of 2/16, I guess I'm a glutton for punishment because this host is still rude."}
{"text":"First time here.  (Yesterday).  It was a terrific evening in the city.  Just before the ball game.  Stumbled upon this restaurant.  

Sitting outside was a great way to start.  

Guacamole was good.  As good as mine.  Also had Gringas because I've never heard of it.  It was very tasty and I'd recommend it. 

For entrees a Enchiladas Tacuba and Tonga De Pollo.   Again, never heard of either but they were delicious.  

If they made their own tortillas I'd have given them the five stars but they don't.  I make my own Flour Tortillas at home and they are fantastic.  A great Mexican Restaurant would do the same.  

It's worth a try.  The food is good."}
{"text":"We walked in after wandering around downtown looking for something to eat on a Saturday night. I was a bit apprehensive at first because the first thing we were told after we were greeted was that they were all out of guac and chips.. (not a great thing to hear at a Mexican restaurant) but, we ended up having a really nice time. 
We ordered a variety of tacos share; there's two tacos per plate so it was easy for me and my partner to split.  We made sure to sample a bit of everything, chicken, steak, and shrimp. We also got a ceviche appetizer.  I love a good ceviche and this did not disappoint. Don't miss it if you stop in. 
We were very pleased with the service and we didn't even mind that there wasn't any guac (turns out that while they had avocados, they were all out of chips.)  The servers all checked in with us, even if they weren't directly responsible for our table, and the host dropped by to chat with us as well.  They are celebrating 10 years in their downtown location, which they should be very proud of.  But, it's not hard to see with great food and exceptional service why they've been around for so long. 
The ONLY complaint we had was that it was very hot in the restaurant.. My boyfriend hates the heat, and I think he was a little uncomfortable but he toughed it out.  
All in all, we really enjoyed it, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Having moved here from the US, I found a lack of good, authentic, hearty Mexican fare west of the GTA. I was really starting to miss it. My sister was assigned the task of picking a restaurant downtown and she found this gem of a place on Queen St W. The place was pretty packed for a Thursday evening which I usually take as a good sign. We were greeted by a very pleasant server who knew the menu in and out and was able to help us modify our menus to suit our taste. 
The tortilla soup had an earthy smoky flavour (yum). I ordered the chicken torta-- huge portion so I ended up taking half of it home. The sangria was fantastic albeit a little mild. But the best part of the course was the jicama, mango, avocado and cucumber salad. It amazing how simple ingredients, if fresh, can make such a simply prepared course so delectable.

Milagro Cantina gets two thumbs up from me! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"NOPE, NO, DO NOT. Disappointing, overpriced Mexican food. I am finding it so hard to find good Mexican food in Toronto, but I won't give up!!! When I asked our server what calabacitas con elotes was his only explanation for it was \"not many people like it!\" Really encouraging. When I asked if it was possible to substitute the side that most customers did not like for rice and beans I was told no, but I could pay for an extra side of rice and beans. It's worth noting that on the sides menu Calabacitas con Elotes cost $6 and Rice and Beans cost $5. Doesn't make sense to not be able to replace the side. My friends Diet Coke was flat, basically soda syrup. When we made our server aware, he brought back a Diet Coke of the same quality. You're better off going to X-tecca for quality Mexican food at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Disaster! Do not go - any other option in the area is better even Hooters! 

We had a group dinner at Milagro last night - reservations made, restaurant not even close to full - but boy you would never know. Horrible, slow, distracted service. Took 45 minutes to get our drinks - and three out of six were sent back. The Guacamole took as long to arrive and bland - I have had better from food courts. We had to keep getting up from our table to get service from the bar, because our waiter either disappeared or walked away mid sentence. And we were not alone - I saw at least one other table threaten not to pay after waiting ridiculous amounts of time for service. The menu is over priced and the food only OK - not authentic and not well executed. I can think of 10 Mexican restaurants I would put well above this - do not go. We ended up leaving and going to order food around the corner...waste of money and totally frustrating. 

This place does not deserve to be in business and any of the extra positive reviews are extremely suspect to me."}
{"text":"I thought the food was excellent. I could see how the service COULD be sub par. I didnt like the look of our waiter and he seemed a bit short with us BUT besides from our cocktails. Everything came prompt, hot and delicious.
A bit loud so don't come expecting to gaze hopelessly in each others eyes whispering sweet nothings--they won't hear it."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. I'm sure I'll go back as I live in the area and the joint is funky and low key. In terms of sexy-ish places to go near yonge and lawrence we're a bit strapped, and milagro fits the bill. Food is delicious. I have no clue if it's authentic, I've never really had Mexican food before and I've never been anywhere near Mexico in my life. The reason for 3 stars is when I first placed my drink order it took forever and a day to come. When I asked for it one of the servers sort of scoffed and told me \"of course it's coming!\". Um....I placed the order 10 minutes ago, and you only have 3 tables going. I want my tequila, gosh darnit. Also, the temp is a bit chilly, especially when you're coming in from a brutally cold winter day and want to warm up. Finally, they tend to seat patrons sort of oddly. Me and my date came in and the host wanted to put us at a small table in the middle of the floor when all the nice comfy booths were open. The first time I went it was a slow night but everyone was seated right up next to each other. Small but noticeable things. Anywho, I really enjoyed my time at milagro and will surely be a repeat customer, just hope these ticks in the experience are not the norm."}
{"text":"In all honesty, the service was so terrible. We came in for a late dinner at 9 and the place was mostly empty, yet somehow it was impossible to flag down a waiter. It took quite a while for someone to take our order and even longer for our waiter to remember that we wanted to pay our bill. We were looking forward to dessert and our waiter neglected to mention that the kitchen was closed by the time we had finished our main course. He asked if we wanted dessert, and after we said yes, he remembered we couldn't have any. Really?
The atmosphere is pretty dreadful but usually that's acceptable when the food and service are worth the visit- they were not. 
Give how many great taquerias have opened in Toronto with the recent taco craze, there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"So good! Best margaritas in the universe for real!
Civeche delightful!! I would come here again and I'm hard to please."}
{"text":"Possibly the nicest service and definitely one of the best Mexican experiences this city has to offer. Great stuff"}
{"text":"As an ex-Californian, I can't justify paying more than a few bucks for Mexican food; let alone close to $100 for a meal for 2. But that is exactly what Milagro expects you to do.

Admittedly, what you get at Milagro isn't what you'd normally find at a taqueria. They serve some impressive sounding entrees but the execution falls a little flat. Appetizers were okay. The Guacamole was nothing special. The Tostadas Vallarta was a little skimpy on the crab and tasted more like crab salad. The Tampiquena (steak) wasn't cooked to our specifications. We asked for medium rare and got a well done steak which was tough and stringy. The Conchinita Pibil was better. Tangy and spicy though just a tad dry. For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Mexicano. It had kick and a nice chocolate and cinnamon flavour. The margaritas aren't anything special but they do serve Mexican beer which complements well with the food.

All in all, it was ok. The service was a little lackadaisical and slow. The food was ok and certainly didn't warrant the price. 

It's a little disappointing how there are few options for Mexican food in Toronto. What I'd do for a simple taqueria with some carne asada tacos..."}
{"text":"It was nice to have vegan and gluten free choices. The pan is used to heat both flour and corn tortillas, so there is cross contamination if you're sensitive. 

Guacamole was good,  refritos standard and the pico was oily. The enchilada had fried peppers, onion and mushroom inside and was topped with chopped onion. It was ok, but not bursting with freshness or flavour. Fresh cilantro would've been nice. 

I would've liked more info on the Just Eats menu so I didn't end up with 2 orders of refritos. 

Ok but not worth reordering. Tacos 101 is cheaper and fresher."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when my fiends suggested this place, as I've never had a Mexican meal that impressed me (granted they've only been at places like Herrnando's Hideway which should probably just \"go away\" from the Toronto food scene for their terrible rendition of Mexican food). But this place completely changed my perception of Mexican. Their guac and beans were the best I've ever had. Pulled pork was amazing too.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I've had Milagro on three occasions: once via delivery, once as a sit down with the regular menu, and once for summerlicious. 

Summerlicious menu is not good. I went last night with some friends and the food was blah at best. I had the ceviche (too tomato-ey), the poblano pepper (had to ask for their hot sauce which was excellent), and their flan which was so-so. My friends got the salad for their app and they loved it 

The sit down with the regular menu was good! My husband had some tacos and I had a burrito plate. The burrito was massive, and it came with beans and rice. Tasty and well-worth the price. 

Reservations are needed because this place gets BUSY!"}
{"text":"I just dont know how to review this place.  It is extremely inconsistent.  Sometimes it is so good, the food arrives promptly and is hot, authentic and delicious and the drinks are perfect.  Othertimes, the service is slow, food arrives lukewarm and the drinks are watered way down.  It is like the restaurant has a split personality.

I recommend making reservations, as i have been turned away from the restaurant when showing up without them, despite half the tables being empty! Frustrating!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely Mexican restaurant. They decorate with Talavera pottery and old Loteria playing cards and it really sets the tone. Mostly, Loteria lets you step into an old part of Mejico which is long gone.

We only stopped for a very small meal. On a crisp Fall day, a bowl of spicy tortilla soup tastes so much like home. Even if home is definitely not Mejico! My friend had the tacos and he had never had authentic Mexican food before and loved it. We share the guacamole. Made with diced tomato and cilantro, this is very fresh guacamole. The lime adds to the freshness and juiciness. 

The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Sit at the bar for the best service!

I'd love to return for a meal. I've been to few Mexican sit down restaurants and this is one I'd love to return to to taste and compare."}
{"text":"We ate at Milagro.  

We had delicious food. The three dip appetizer was fantastic with wonderful guacamole and some of the best refried beans I have ever had. We also started with the ceviche which was to die for. 

Those in my party got the tacos for their mains and were thoroughly impressed.  I had the meatballs and made my own make shift tacos.  The centre of the meatballs was Gouda cheese and it could have been a little hotter in the middle but was tasty and the sauce was amazing. 

Where they lost marks was on the service.  Our waiter was barely around and we ordered another round of drinks before dinner and didn't get them until we were done our meals.   Not exactly the best service.  The food was fantastic and we would go back again after trying some other Mexican places around the city."}
{"text":"Pretty overpriced. Had fish and pork tacos, the fish came in a gummy flour tortilla, and wasn't offered hot sauce until my last bite :(  it's not bad, there are just a lot of really amazing tacos in the city and this isn't the place to get them. If you eat here, skip the tacos."}
{"text":"Was there last night for dinner and the worst experience. Very dissatisfied. Service was slow, food was cold, tacos were stale, cold and had no flavour. The meat in my taco was cold hate and way over cooked. I didn't want to eat it but I was hungry and service was so slow ok nobody was coming to check up so I forced myself to eat it. Overall would not go back. Bad service. Bad food as it was not fresh and flavourless."}
{"text":"Update 2016 - unfortunately, declining quality of food continues. I guess the head chef decided to water down the food (and that's not including my last visit, when I got lukewarm food while the person who ordered with me received her food hot - after a very long wait in an empty restaurant). I also recently ordered delivery and ... The beans were entirely different! Come on. 

Update August 2015 - still good but not the same; today's visit had all the salsas and sauces watery and weak tasting. Those are the reason I come here ... Cold chips. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place after a day spent at Trinity Bellwoods Park. Absolutely delicious. Super fresh ingredients. We got the shrimp, braised beef & pork tacos. Gaucomole, salsa & ceviche. All truly hit my taste buds in all the right places. Be sure to try their green hot sauce. Just the right kick to every nicely balanced bite."}
{"text":"Home run ! Top notch Service, food and atmosphere.  The offer no charge sparkling water and free tortilla chips with an order of guacamole.   Staff are friendly and accommodating.   The portions are healthy and do not leave you wanting more.  Will be back!  Mi gusta!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food. Worth the price, great ambience. Service is okay. Large portion size."}
{"text":"The service was poor, bad waiter who could care less that we were even there until it was time to pay the bill. 

Table was dirty and I ended  up staining my shorts since there was sauce under the table which dripped on me.   Took 20 minutes to get chips and salsa and when the chips arrived they were all broken pieces. I had to get up and ask the manager for new ones, which he never ended up bringing out.   There was however a nice waitress who noticed we were not enjoying our apps and quickly came and asked if we would like more chips and within 2 minutes she had a fresh batch sent to us.    She also said that she would send the manager out to address the issues we had.  I noticed her tell him but he never came out.  

Very poor customer service and management and since we are visiting here on vacation I will never advise anyone to visit here.  Many better places then this."}
{"text":"overall good food. a bit pricy though due to its location but overall it's a decent place to go from time to time."}
{"text":"Came here for a work event and really liked the vibe of the place. Ambience is super relaxing and fun. The guacamole is SO delicious, I could not have enough of it. It's almost (just almost) as good as mine :P the sangria was also yummy although it did taste a bit watered down. Unfortunately, what really did not do it for me was the tacos. We got a variety of different taco fillings and it was just so bland tasting. Idk if the cooks forgot to put seasoning / sauce in it, but it was just not good which is disappointing for a Mexican restaurant. Overall though, I would come here again just for that guac and tequila! Yum!"}
{"text":"As a Mexican, I can verify this place is the real deal. :)

Stellar food, chill ambience. I'm listening to Billy Holiday and munching on the best guacamole possible, a perfect ceviche, and tacos de carnitas (so good, I had to order them twice...and pull out the Yelp app to write this)."}
{"text":"Very fair price for honnest food in a casual ambiance. Definitely enjoy going there for a relax dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"This place was impressively busy for a Friday, but I've started to learn to expect that along this section of Yonge on a Friday/Saturday night. By the time we arrived, all tables were either currently occupied or being held for reservations so we were happy to sit at the bar.

Drink menu is extensive. With everything from Mexican soft drinks to many types of tequila to classics such as Pina Coladas/Sangrias/Mojitos. All drinks are blended using the old traditional methods. They are also one of the first places I've been to that features Tableau filtered/sparkling water but they only charge for sparkling.

Food menu has traditional Mexican fare. As I'm generally not friendly with spicy, I was concerned with the warning at the bottom of the menu stating \"Our food is spicy\". However, I was quickly reassured by the waitress that as long as you can tolerate minimal heat there are options. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu including how spicy each dish was and all the ingredients in each. She was a great help.

I had one of the enchiladas and on the spicy scale would rate it maybe 2 out of 10, very mild. The chicken was perfectly spiced and was so soft. The whole dish was delicious. It was accompanied with Spanish rice that was also very good and not spicy.

For dessert, my friend and I ordered two orders of churros. both were slightly well-done and extra crispy but still very tasty. It is accompanied with chocolate sauce that had a slight kick to it but tasted so good.

Price point is higher than some of the other dinner spots in the area but the portions are a really good size and you can tell the chefs and bartenders know what they are doing. I wouldn't necessarily go back on a regular basis but if someone was in the mood for this type of food, I would definitely recommend this place as a suitable option (and be happy to accompany them)."}
{"text":"Tacos and authentic Mexican dishes were deliciosso!   A wide variety of tequila drinks as well"}
{"text":"Amazing service and decent food amd drinks. Our server just made the over all experience perfect. Thank you! Ihad the chicken and beef Rib tacos with 2 large margaritas. Yum. My gf had the shrimp Tacos and absolutely loved them  Everything was perfect. The desert (Churos) were on the burnt side though so, will not order those again.The service however more than makes up for everything. Had a great night. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"WE went here last night and it was fantastic! The service was spot on and food was perfect. For the people who complain that this isn't real Mexican food .... that is a complete joke! The are obviously confused with Taco Bell or some other chain rendition. Think \"Like Water for Chocolate\", this food is sublime!"}
{"text":"You know those late hungover brunches that you force yourself to eat, atrocious as they may be, because you're too hungry boycott for greener pastures? And then you regret the whole experience so immensely you wish for death? That was my experience with Milagro.

First thing my partner and I did when we crawled in was order drinks: a beer, caesar and a flight of mezcals (we'd had a long night). I always sub tequila for vodka in my caesar and add a dash of red wine for flavour, which one of our two (?) idle servers did very nervously. She confessed she was afraid her co-worker would charge me for the nominal amount of wine. Mezcal flight was good, but is also a common denominator available at many DT Toronto bars/restos.

We had fish tacos and a squid ceviche, both of which were obviously frozen and a little past due. I saw a previous review in which the yelper mentioned a 'weird oniony taste' which I can confirm in the ceviche. The place also reeked of a strange, undefinable dank smell, which we couldn't place. The food taste may have been affected by this but it was nonetheless extremely disappointing and expensive. Don't waste your $$$ here."}
{"text":"The chicken tortas were perfect. Full of flavour and nicely piled up. The beef tacos were cooked nice and moist. The enchaladas were yummy and filling. Went without a reservation so had to wait a bit for a table. We dealt with the host, bartender and 3 different servers. Everyone was pleasant, charming, friendly and courteous. Great ambience, amazing service and above all, tasty food. 
Can't wait to go again...This time with a reservation :)"}
{"text":"First time here on the recommendation of a friend.  It definitely got busier as the night went on!  The food was good, the guacamole was great, but the service could be better.  I had a tinga clasicos - the chicken was done very well, the rice was a bit too hard for my liking.  The service could be better, but to be fair, it was quite busy.  However, it was a turn off when my friend reminded the waiter about her drink order (that was placed 20 minutes ago) and the waiter acted like it was the first time he's ever heard the order.  Not the greatest."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this one. The location is great. Our service was attentive and pleasant. But the food was only halfway there.  We started off with chips and guacamole which was about $8. The guacamole was delicious, but the chips - oddly - were the let down. I'm not that picky, but these were double-thick, hard as rock and tasted old and oily. My friend had the tortillia soup and sent it back - and she never sends anything back. However, i found both the shrimp and chicken tacos were delicious.  The shrimp tacos had giant tiger shrimp and the right mix of flavours.

I'd say they are worth a try for the tacos, but skip the chips and soup."}
{"text":"I craved ceviches one Sunday, and the Yelp app brought me there.  I admitted the low rating got me worried at first, but craving won the brain and here I was.

We noted that Milagro is a Mexican restaurant, so we steered clear of the odd main entrees and ordered the staples.  

Drinks - The classic margarita on slash ice was *delicious*, really good.  I ordered a small for $8, and it is a good size.  I would not order a large for $15 though - just too pricey.  My partner ordered an imported beer ($6), and he liked it refreshing.  

Appetizers - The guacamole ($8 for size small) was not too diluted like some cheaper places, but my partner found it a tart too salty.  In addition, Milagro's version has more lime than usual.  If one does not like as much lime, then one may want to avoid it, unfortunately.  I also enjoyed the complimentary salsa and chips.  The inhouse chips were crunchy.  They were not oily at all, in contrast to some previous reviews.  I did get full pretty fast with the chips.

Ceviche - I really liked the octopus/shrimp/crab ceviche ($12 for size small).  It was fresh, refreshing, loads of cilantro and lime juice.  The size small was a good size to share between 2 to 3 people.  I recommend this one.

Tacos - We ordered a roast chicken with chipotle tacos and a battered snapper with cole slaw tacos.   Each order included 2 tacos.  This automatically made the tacos 33% more expensive that other Mexican restaurants I had been to.  But WAIT - the snapper tacos were HUGE.  Too bad I could not say the same thing about the roast chicken tacos.  In terms of taste, the battered snapper tacos tasted fresh and clean, with a good crunchy texture from the cole slaw, plus a spicy punch from the sauce.  The roast chicken tacos were meaty and tasted bold and spicy.  I personally think that the snapper tacos are the winner of the two, and the win is about the taste not the portion, even though it also wins on portion.

Services - I think the management might have listened to the Yelpers' complaints and improved the services, because we didn't experience any slow service or wait time like some previous reviewers had.  The restaurant was 80~90% full.  We got seated right away.  The waitress and waiter asked us on drink order, food order quick enough.  The food arrived in reasonable time.  The waitress followed up to see if we had any issues.  Empty plates were promptly removed.  I honestly had no issue with the service this evening.

The final bill was $60, tax included.  Considering that we had 4 tapas and 2 alcoholic drinks, this was reasonable.  Milagro is pricier than a basic taco and burrito joint, but Milagro is in an expensive neighbourhood.  The ingredients are fresh, and the cooking is good.  If you stay with Mexican staples, instead of some lamb or pulled pork, I think your experience will be just fine."}
{"text":"Ok - I actually really like this place and am surprised by the less than stellar reviews. I think the Queen location is wayyyy better than the Mercer street location, both in terms of ambiance and service.

Things I liked: the guacamole is incredibly fresh and delicious, with a very generous portion size; the sangria is fantastic - some of the best I've ever had; and, the atmosphere is great... fun crowd and friendly service.

I agree that it's not the most attentive service I've experienced, but nobody was rude and our server was fun - he joked around and was helpful with recommendations.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm also surprised at how negative the reviews are here.  I went last weekend with a friend and we both enjoyed this restaurant.  It certainly isn't perfect but it's worth checking out.
The food was good.  It's not great and I'm not sure if it is authentic mexican but I was reasonably happy with my meal (though as others have posted, the guac is a little bland).  My friend was quite happy with her enchiladas as well. 
The service was fantastic.  Our waitress was very attentive and answered all of our questions about individual dishes (and I was having a rather indecisive night so there were many questions).  She also offered us a less expensive half order option when we tried to order a dish that would have been much too large for the two of us as a starter.
We had margeritas with our dinner and, while pricey, the cucumber margerita was an absolutely fantastic concoction which I will certainly be returning for when I need a treat."}
{"text":"Place is a ridiculous rip off. $35 for a pitcher of \"sangria\" was nothing but fruit juice. No alcohol at all. They don't even give chips and salsa. What Mexican restaurant doesn't give chips and salsa? The entrées don't come with any side dishes. Ordered the tacos  and it  just came with two tacos. No beans no rice no salad. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place - I could just eat here every day... Wonderful guacamole, fantastic margaritas and I'm addicted to their Tacos Capital."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here. Lots of great vegan options. My favourites are the trio botanero (without cheese) and the vegan rojas enchiladas. So delicious!

The staff are always friendly, helpful and accomodating. I come here about once a month.

Note: Entrance and washrooms are barrier-free but doors are a little heavy."}
{"text":"The service was ok, felt rushed a bit. I quickly ordered the fish tacos. There was no flavour to it and the fish was overly battered, not enough fish. Side note, complimentary nachos and salsa. Also not too crazy about."}
{"text":"YEOWIE YUM!

Toronto Mexican sucked....until I found this place. Although it was strange being served Mexican food by a guy from Edinburgh, Scotland, the cook and ingredients are clearly right out of home (I'm from Southern California by way of Utah, USA. I KNOW good Mexican food, as it's been a staple in my diet for decades.

Milagro has a terrific ambiance,  right out of Tolume. The food is righteous, the hot is hot, the mild is not, and it is spot-on for what I generally expect.

Prices are definitely not Mexican nor SoCal prices, but they are price-appropriate for Toronto.  The wait for food was short, the margaritas in between were well-made and not shy on the tequila. The staff are friendly, efficient, and they participated in some of the pinata fun we had going on. 

I can't recommend this place more highly. For the first time in Canada, I ordered second helpings for take-home, and the pork was just as spicy-sweet at home as it was in the restaurant.

In keeping with the tradition of improvement... Milagro; if a customer asks for a \"small tub\" to take home for seconds, I'd suggest being a tad more generous. I think the portions put on my plate were much larger than the portions I found in my bag when I got home. I was mildly disappointed in the size of the take-home portion."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch mood!!! I decided to try out Milagro with a bunch of friends. The decor is ambience is unique and colourful. 
I ordered the eggs with mole sauce because I wanted to taste mole as I haven't had it before. The sauce was delicious although accompanying it with eggs (I guess sunny side up) that almost felt undercooked made the entire dish extremely slimy. 
The churros on the other hand was tasty and I would recommend the Mexican cappuccino which is yum!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my pal at Milagro. In the middle of a residential neighbourhood, I thought that it wouldn't be busy, but it was packed last night. On a Friday night, reservations are a must. There were a lot of families here so you will see heaps of kids. The food was okay - nothing to write home about, but not terrible too. We ordered guacamole to start with; it was pretty average. Then again, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make this dip. The enchiladas Rojas were okay too. I found the rice on the side to be extremely dry though. The churro dessert came with about five so I would highly suggest that you share. After taxes and tip, my pal and I paid $100. Is it worth it? No.

Good for: Mexican"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and authentic. However we went on a Sunday and half the things on the menu were not available."}
{"text":"I went here last night for Margarita Tuesday.  Its in the bottom of my building so I was quite excited to try it out.  I walk past it every single day and its usually empty which worried me a little, I read the reviews on Yelp...all negative, but I was still determined I was going to like this place.  

So a few of us went to check it out.  Empty of course...maybe 3-4 other tables were there.  First of all the waitress was patronizing which really irritated me.  We were delberating over drinks because some of us didn't want to the classic margarita which is the only thing on special on Margarita but we did afterall come for Margarits Tuesday.  She pointed out to us several times that only the classic Margarita was on special.  Both verbally and visually by pointing this out on the menu.  Um thanks...if you were actually listening to our converstation we are quite clear on the fact that only the classic margarita is on special.  

Then we order.  I'm completely astonished by the prices on the menu.  I've been to upscale Mexican and have no problems paying a premium but even just by looking on the menu I could tell this was far from upscale.  One of my friends asked the waitress if she had any recommendations.  The waitress asked \"Do you like spicy\"?  My friend said no, so the waitress proceeds to give her some non-spicy recommendations.  Then she gets to me, I am in the mood for spicy and since her first question to my friend is \"do you like spicy?\" there must be something good thats spicy.  So I ask \" Is there anything that you recommend thats spicy?\".  She responds \"Mexican food isn't spicy\", so I saw \"Oh you just asked my friend if she liked spicy?\".  Blank stare.  Proceeds to recommend a few things.  My friend ordered Chicken with mole sauce.  She asked him if he had ever had mole sauce, he hadn't , he asked him if he liked cocoa, he said yes.  She told him several times that mole sauce is very \"different\" and he should make sure he knew what he was getting into to.  After he says, several times that he's sure it will be fine she allows him to order the mole sauce.  A few minutes later she appears at the table with a sample of mole sauce just as a \"precautionary measure\".  I mean I get it, mole sauce isn't for everyone but don't treat him like a child.  Giving one warning about it is sufficient.  

Food comes, its very lackluster.  I had the conchita pibil, edible sure but not worth the $24 I paid for it.  It was a little bland and really dry  its and considering its stewed/pulled pork I'm a little confused about why it could get so dry.  We had the guac to start, it was fine but nothing special.  

So we finish eating and are waiting for our waitress who has apparently disappeared, its not busy so its not as if she's busy with other customers.  She finally appears so we get our check and then she disappeared for another significant period of time before we can give her our credit card.  

I will say though, that the margaritas are very tasty so go for drinks but definitely NOT dinner.  

The drinks are pretty tasty, I will give them that."}
{"text":"Decided to go here before seeing a show because I have not been terribly impressed with any of the restaurants along the King strip (between Simcoe and Spadina). As others have already mentioned, mediocre food and the prices are grossly inflated. 
The place itself is nice enough. A bit dark but cute Mexican touches in the decor. There is a patio too, but not the best location, on the busy sidewalk of John St. 
We went on Thursday, which is sangria day - $4.95 for a glass. This was the only good thing about the night! The sangria Americana has a peach twist and was very yummy! Regularly, it is $11/glass or so. 
We shared this melted cheese dip appetizer. It was served piping hot (the cheese was actually bubbling... a little scary) and was pretty tasty, although the cheese dip to tortillo ratio was not favourable. We inhaled it in a few minutes.
They also serve tortilla chips and salsa to every table. The salsa was very watery and lacked flavour. 
I had the red snapper with salsa verde, which was just okay. The fish didn't seem all that fresh though. My friends has tacos. The portions were generous, but the prices were high -- around $18 per dish. 
Service was hit and miss. They brought the appetizer quickly but took a long time with our entrees. If we hadn't come so early, I would've been worried about missing our show. We had multiple servers, which made things a bit disjointed. They were at least Spanish-speaking (looks like when A.S. went, there were no Spanish-speaking staff). 
They also refused to split our bill (really? for just 3 people? when the restaurant is really not busy at all?). 
Okay, back to square one for finding a decent and not overpriced restaurant in the Entertainment District..."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday with friends, as a group of 3. The patio was nice and quiet, interior seemed nice too. Ordered three dips to start (guac, refried beans, pico de gallo) and I had the playeros (chicken) tacos. Food was decent but not mind-blowing - the dishes weren't as flavourful as I would've liked. We also shared a pitcher of margaritas which was very good (and better value than the individual cocktails). Overall a decent dinner option in a busy and expensive neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Staff was great, food is delicious, love the decor and ambience. Was my first time there, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was quite satisfied with my first experience at Milago (Yonge & Lawrence). The restaurant was packed around 7pm on a Friday night and the staff was very accommodating in finding a table for my friend and me.  The atmosphere was lively which was especially refreshing to see in the normally quiet, reserved neighbourhood.  The restaurant was busy so the service was swift but pleasant, with  just the right amount of familiarity.  I love ceviche and they have a great variety. My friend said his fish tacos were delicious.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Some of the best margarita's, taco's of my life!!! The staff are pretty cute...with the exception of the overbearing bartender who disliked giving out straws.....I get it the environment however your shpiel about this should be more organic and less guilt inducing.  

The tacos we ordered two at a time and let me tell you they were, full of flavour not too flimsy and yet enough for you to open your mouth wide!  Great for a chatting and drinking with a friend.  The churros...normally I do not get to excited for however these WERE THE BEST OF MY LIFE!  Hot, sweet a bit salty yet all deep-fried goodness....so good WE HAD TWO ORDERS OF THEM!!!!

 I suggest coming here and trying what fleets your fancy however I do highly suggest the churros...these were damn good."}
{"text":"I would have moved this to a 4 star but the food was not hot enough when it was served. I had the 3 type burrito which certainly had the taste factor. They also had the very BEST retried beans I've ever had from any Mexican Restaurant. They also had great tasting Margaritas served in a glass or pitcher. The pitcher was $45.00/pitcher btw. All in all it was good but not great cause of the temp of the food."}
{"text":"Amaze-ing! 
I have found my new brunch place ! The coffee was on point and my eggs ( scrambled with Oaxaca cheese) and the coffee was made to order. For vegetarians there are are also great options! AND THE BEANSSSSS WOW!  I shall be going there this weekend coming up !"}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favourite places for authentic Mexican food. I've only come here for brunch a few times and every time the food is amazing and exactly what I wanted. There's a lot of space to sit inside and the service is great. The waiters and owner are really nice. Today I got the huevos milagro and it was absolutely delicious! They stuff cheese and chicken into tortillas and cover it in salsas and two fried eggs, and a side of potatoes and beans. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Brutal to find parking on Queen street on a Friday or Saturday night but the ceviche and shrimp tacos making it all worth while. Service is sometimes a little slow and i feel it is a little pricey for the style of food but it is certainly one of our regular stops on Queen St."}
{"text":"We came here as a large party for a weekday work lunch.. We ordered guacamole and chips to start, which was a huge portion and very delicious. I got a white wine sangria and fish tacos. The service was quite slow even though they were nowhere near capacity. The fish tacos were okay, nothing special..slightly soggy from the salsa that was put in it. 

Would not go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Just terrible. Don't go here. 
Started with the complimentary chips. Mine had a piece of plastic with it, which was gross. 
Ordered the guac, which was fine but they brought it out 30 seconds after ordering so it doesn't seem like it's made fresh.
I got the fish tacos with the crema on the side... I guess that also meant I didn't want pico de gallo (not sure how) so they brought that on the side too. 
The fish was mushy and clearly frozen, the slaw its served with is pickled cabbage, which didn't fit at all and there was way too much cabbage and the pico was like 2 hours away from being rotten. The tomatoes were so soft and tasted unfresh. 
Also tried the house sangria and it was gross. It was red wine that tasted like it came from a bottle that's been sitting open for a while and it was just mixed with some lemon syrup or something... served in a pop glass. It was just a bad food experience from start to finish. Definitely a skip. Better to spend your money at chipotle"}
{"text":"First stab at Mexican food in the city, and I have to say it was a 3.5/5. The atmosphere was fun and hip, even passing through a set of red velvet drapes to enter the restaurant. On second thought, maybe these were there because it was cold outside. Nevertheless, it created a distinct and hip atmosphere within the first few seconds of stepping into restaurant, and it doesn't stop there. All the servers had an air of coolness around them, yet they still maintained an infectious friendliness and smile. 

My friend and I order a strawberry margarita (delicious and refresing, not overly sweet) and a classic lime margarita (lacking in lime flavour). For a starter, we had the ceviche de camaron. Is it bad that my favourite thing about this ceviche was not the tender shrimp, but the crisp and crunchy jicama? This was my first experience with jicama, but it's going to be a food I start seeking out more often. For mains, we shared the tacos de barbacoa and red snapper. The red snapper was delicious and we cooked, however the barbacoa was the star of the night. The tender lamb was so juicy, I think we both used at least two napkins on the tacos alone. The sauce had a wonderful smokiness that dance on my taste buds. 

Overall this was a beautiful expression of Mexican food in the heart of the city and a great birthday meal. :)"}
{"text":"Have recently moved to Toronto and was asking around for a recommendation for the best Mexican in the city. Milagro was one of the names I was given and they definitely didn't disappoint! 

Between two of us, we shared the half order of guacamole (a very healthy serving), the trio of salsas, the roasted lamb enchilada (pachuca) and the plain quesadillas. Not only was the food delicious, but it was the most authentic Mexican food I've eaten outside of Mexico! The chips and salas that came with everything were actually even better than I've had in Mexico. 

We each ordered a glass of wine with dinner and ended up with a $70 bill (including tip) which I think is pretty decent. There was plenty of food for the two of us and we left feeling satiated and satisfied.

All in all, will definitely be returning to enjoy Milagro's fare again soon."}
{"text":"This was my second visit despite reading some not so good reviews! We were a party of six and except for one; we all liked our choices. I ordered battered cod tacos which was simply delicious. The guacamole too was perfect and very freshly made! Our waiter Gustavo was attentive and nice. All our food came together and that was great. I will go there again to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Good food and service. We were a large group that went here on a Monday. The venue was accommodative and food came out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"It's alright, not the best Mexican food I've had.  Had the carnitas and it was super oily, other than that the food is alright, cool modern Mexican ambience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food at this location better than the one on Queen W.   The restaurant is a little more open and has a more familiar feel, really cool Mexican memorabilia and decorative staples.  Sharing dishes of meat are really good for groups, and the Mexican specialty drinks/juices were really great."}
{"text":"I'm dropping my rating for this place on my last visit.

We did Summerlicious, which was fine and the offering was great for me. I just found the menu really inflexible at times and we were restricted either to their Summerlicious menu or their Brunch menu which was a bit frustrating because I was looking for something more substantial at 3 PM. The staff tried to accommodate as best they could but I wasn't too impressed. 

The food here is great though but I just hope they could cater to more needs in the future."}
{"text":"I love love love to eat tacos and drink anything that has tequila in it. They were great at accommodating my big group. We had made a reservation for 15 girls in celebrating my friend bachlorette party. The decor and music did set the mood, which made us feel like we were dining in Mexico. The menu had drinks on one side and food on the other. I had ordered  a Plata margaritas (made wit 2.5 oz. Of tromba tequila...my fav) and la perla tacos (fish tacos). Our table came wit salsa n chips. The fish tacos were delish however the coleslaw was a little spicy for me. Overall the meal was delish however it was overly pricey. My bill came up to $42 dollars. I would come back for drinks but tacos were $12.50 for two which in my opinion is overly priced."}
{"text":"I love Mexican, but this was not my favorite.  We started off with chips, salsa an guacamole.  The guacamole was great but the salsa tasted like lime and nothing else.  For a main I had a pulled pork enchilada in a mole sauce.  It was very tasty but there was too much mole sauce."}
{"text":"Excruciatingly slow service, but amazing food. Not necessarily authentic, but very good quality."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for dinner, one of the couples chose this place since La Carnita was fully booked. The inside is nice and the food was okay. Wasn't too impressed. One friend sent her dish back due to flavours being off and got a different dish. My dish was okay. Had cod tacos which were good and the Alambre. Had Alambre leftovers the next day and it upset my stomach and I have a very strong stomach so not going back."}
{"text":"Took my sister here for her birthday, we began our dinner with guacomoli dip and a sort of large chip, fantastic choice! We continued our celebrations with some beer, and a dinner platter that is best described as a fajita dish, a large plate of chicken and onions among other falvours, little tortia's and topping. Was  a great dish, a little spicy, which I enjoy, not so much my sister.

The staff are as you could expect from a higher end restuarant, very attentive and knowledgable. Would go here again, and reccomend."}
{"text":"I had dinner here about a year ago (previous to my start of using yelp) and thought i should share... no, warn people about how bad this place is.

Went in with a group of friends and got seated in a booth by the kitchen, now keep in mind the kitchen is rather open... which made it rather hot, and not a very pleasant experience to start.

The food was very average both in portion and in quality, and it was waaaay over priced in my opinion.

\"gourmet mexican\" is a bit of an oxy-moron to me, granted if it was really good i'd be happy to pay extra for delicious food but this place was well below average in quality for a mexican place (Rancho Relaxo is far better), and the price was what i felt to be much higher for food and drinks.

Id rather walk down the street and hit up Tortilla Flats... and even that is only average, but at least they have some decent drinks specials there."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was very good.

It's a smallish, colorful place though quite nondescript from the outside. I went on a warm Sunday back in March (on a day like today, it seems like eons ago), when almost everybody was out on the streets. 

The food is decent, though not as great as our server made it out to be. He breathlessly mentioned best-mexican-in-toronto and arcade fire and a whole bunch of other bands that eat there.

Complimentary tortilla chips and salsa were brought very promptly to our table, and then refilled very promptly too.

Our server  was great at explaining the menu, which is pretty extensive. One in our party is vegetarian, and the server was thoughtful enough to mention that the burrito contained mayo which contained eggs. The mayo was removed, of course!

Our food was tasty and filling, but not very Mexican tasting. The vegetarian burritos were ginormous, with a large core of lettuce. Almost like eating a tortilla salad! The meat burritos were pretty decent. Is a burrito even a Mexican thing, or it just a white-person's- mexican creation, a la chicken tikka masala? 

Special mention to the piddly bowl of hot salsa, that was really, really spicy.

I ordered a side of potatoes, that were very tasty, but again not sure if that's an authentic Mexican creation.

The alcoholic creations were a hit: the margaritas were very strong. Muy Bueno! 

Milagro doesn't split bills, which is a bit annoying but thank god for my mental math skills and to everyone else who deigned to whip out their phone calculators despite the food coma.

Food: fresh and pretty tasty, but didn't seem very authentic to my non native tongue
Service: prompt, courteous and enthusiastic
Chances of being back: unfortunately not very large, but that's because there's much better Mexican to be had in the city."}
{"text":"There must have been an ownership change at this restaurant. I've dined at Milagro several times in the past and this is the first time where I felt thoroughly insulted by the quality of service and food. It's not as if there is a shortage of Mexican restaurants in this city or dining alternatives in general so one would imagine that competitiveness would be be a business driver, yet it wasn't. 

We ordered from the Summerlicious menu at around 7pm, first thing i'm told is that they are out of the dessert I requested; It's early for dinner service and half the seats are empty. I request chips as I have in the past and they arrive stale and chewy. The food took literally 50 minutes - timed, to arrive (the food being a rib eye steak and potatoes) mediocre at best and easily something I could have fired up on my own grille at home. Nothing special about this meal at all that would require so much prep time, and more insulting was zero remorse for the fact that our food arrived almost an hour after ordering. 

Most people that dine out expect a pleasant experience, i think that its fair to ask for paying a premium for food. I couldn't wait another second to get out of this place and I left feeling insulted by the indifference of the service staff for ruining a basic meal that tasted no better than what I could have prepared at home."}
{"text":"So much for that, they don't even offer the sangria that everyone loved. Their tacos are tiny, expensive and VERY bland, this place is now just awful. I'll never go here again with so many better options within walking distance."}
{"text":"Below average. Margarita was not good. Pork was greasy and flavorless. Steak tacos were good. Chips not very fresh. Corn tortillas were very good and warm.  Service was good except the busboys who clear tables....why must they interfere with dinner and try to clear so quickly?  Twice we had to wave him away and say no thank you, we are still dining. 

Nice facility, nice service, good music. A tad expensive especially with below average food."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch

Good things:
Attentive service - someone is always there to help without being intrusive
Refried beans are fantastic

So-so things:
Menu is confusing. The tacos listed are 2 tacos with no sides. You can upgrade to a dinner with three tacos rice and beans, but the menu doesn't tell you that and the waiter was unclear on how much that cost - $6 or so??  (It was $7)

The abodabo tacos I had were fine though not all that flavorful. 

Overall, I'd come again, but it won't be a high priority."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Atmosphere was nice. The enchiladas were pretty good but everything else was meh. The guac was really good which is why this gets a 4 star from me."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! From the margaritas to guacamole to main dishes.. Everything was amazing! The servers were friendly and fun to interact with. I had the fish tacos and was in heaven! Also.. Order the margarita with cucumber.. Amazingly refreshing! 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a team lunch here with 20+ people and everything was fantastic from the food to the servers. They were able to accommodate some people in our group who had allergies with no issues."}
{"text":"Came here in the summer for some lunch with friends. Sat on roof top patio which seemed like a cool place to have some drinks and eat on a Sunday afternoon. 

Took over 30 minutes just for a waitress to take our drink orders! I was getting \"hangry\" by that point too so it was hard not to get annoyed. Ordered some standard guacamole and some chips to start, with a flight of tequila. Had steak fajitas as a main course. Didn't finish till 3.5 hours later.. Food was very slow. Nothing memorable and it certainly wasn't because of the tequila. That wore off the first hour.. Will I go back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Food is traditionall with an extensive tequila menu"}
{"text":"This place was pretty nice with balcony seating. 
We had the small guac to start and the Fish tacos were delicious! I opted for the dinner size which comes with an extra taco (3 as opposed to 2) and the rice and beans all for $7.50 more. 

Plus 1 drink each and the meal was perfect for a light dinner for two. 

All I can say is the meal hit the spot for my Mexican food craving and we will be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"(3.5) -  Went for dinner here last night with a friend. We got there around 5:30 and there was lots of seating available without a reservation; closer to 6:30 this place was packed!

The $6 specials (from 3pm-6pm) are great!
We got the guac and chips and margaritas that were on special - the guacamole is seriously addicting (we ended up getting 2 orders) and the margarita was delicious as well! 

What I didn't like: The service!! When we first arrived, our server was great and very attentive! But she left at 6pm and said the guy at the bar would be taking over. He never did come over to us (we were probably waiting close to 30 mins). We had to ask another server if we could order more food. 
The panela buritto I ordered was okay, I have definitely had better. It was huge, but lacked overall flavour and had way too much sour cream for my liking. 

I would visit again, but probably just for drinks and appetizers during their $6 special."}
{"text":"the atmosphere here is warm and cozy. we stopped in hoping to get some food and drinks around 11. we were given food menus-then told 2 secs later the kitchen was closed. that was so disappointing because the menu looked delicious. 

anyway just ended up getting a classic magarita which was really good, i would come back to get it again."}
{"text":"Popped in to Milagro last night after seeing The Raid Redemption (AWESOME, btw!) for a quick bite after scouring the strip trying to decide on something different. I've been to the location on Mercer before and this definitely had a different vibe: it had atmosphere!!! It was super lively and packed with good music streaming out onto the street. We were lucky to actually be able to grab the last table in the house.

Decided on a pitcher of traditional sangria, the new ceviche de pescado (with snapper - new on the menu), the tacos de tinga (have always enjoyed these) and the atún burrito (tuna) which also looked like something new on the menu. The sangria was tasty, as was the ceviche - it was really quite delicious with the perfect balance of tart & sweet (lime, onions, mangos, cilantro - if you know ceviche, you know the drill!). I have 2 complaints about the ceviche, even though it was delicious: It was quite overpriced for what it was (I believe between $15-$16 for a \"large\" portion), and there were only a few pieces of snapper - the rest of the ceviche was more onion and veg (more onion than anything) than fish - with other ceviches I've had in the past, the focus is on the fish and not the veg. So it seemed a bit chintzy for what it was on that note.. 

The tacos de tinga were good, but a bit on the greasier side this time. The burrito on the other hand was truly delicious, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I would highly reco this dish!

Not sure if this location is different than Mercer, but we noticed (after the fact) that we didn't get a basket of nachos + salsa which we usually do at its sister location. The food was good and the vibe was actually great; much better if you're looking for atmosphere. Mercer, no matter what time of day I have gone, is always vacant and just lacks in ambiance overall. We enjoyed our meal, albeit for mexican food which should be cheap, this is defo more on the expensive side of things. Would I reco? Yes, definitely a cool spot with tasty treats and a good vibe overall, but could definitely use improvement in certain areas."}
{"text":"I bookmarked Milagro over a year ago, following a series of dinners that were remarkable for their unremarkableness. 

Maybe I'm on the wrong side of history. Since my visits, the brothers Anhalt have added locations and business seems to be booming. 

Maybe they were fortunate to be at the forefront of the Toronto Taco Tsunami that sees new artisanal mexican places pop up every week. 

I'd feel better about it if the food were generally hot in temperature rather than lukewarm; the meet more tender and less dry; the tortillas less crumbly and the salsa more fresh. Chicken in mole tastes like burning. Pibil tastes like, well, nothing. Stuffed peppers don't deserve the fun and flare that comes with the exotic name \"chili rellenos\". Beer is cheap, but if you're not drinking, serves pretty much leave you alone for the evening. 

For half the price I'd gladly trek to El Trompo for what I proudly consider a hearty MexiCanadian breakfast: a plate of Tacos Al Pastor, with succulent meat enlivened by fresh, juicy pineapple, and a few tallboy Tecates to wash them down. 

Milagro's owners seem like swell guys, but great mexican food and good service shouldn't leave one praying for a miracle."}
{"text":"Awesome place! We had six different plates and no complaints from anyone. Excellent service, waitress (Mercedes)made friends with our two year old, she was awesome. Ate the Alambra, it was heavenly! A nice place to chill over lunch in the heart of the city!"}
{"text":"This place is great - food is authentic and the flavour is amazing.  Have had the chicken mole and its filling, tasty and delicious.  The 2.5 oz margaritas are great as well to help wash it all down.

It's also great inside with the decor and seating - service was attentive and friendly and atmosphere during lunch was comfortable."}
{"text":"We came here for my Birthday Dinner on a Monday in Feb. It seems the main chef was off on the Monday. Food was OK, but the Queen street location is best."}
{"text":"OK, first of all I'll say that I have been a fan of milagro for years and have always enjoyed my experience. The food is consistent and delicious.  However, the service today at the Mercer location was terrible, ruining my experience and causing me to remove milagro from  my go-to restaurant list. The server was a younger woman who was obviously not interested in  her job this morning. When asked for her suggestion between two menu items, she just shrugged and said both were fine.  No help there. After ordering we had to flag her down for chips for the table to snack on (something I've never had to do at a milagro). When our appetizer came, my fiance had to go inside from our table on the patio to find her and get small plates so we could eat. The first time he couldn't find anyone and the second time he returned inside he asked her if he could take some from the pile and instead of bringing them out she just told him they were clean and he brought them to the table himself.  We never were asked how things were tasting or how our experience was, and to top it all off the restaurant wasn't even busy to excuse this lack of attention. She was unfriendly abs unhelpful.  Very disappointing. I would suggest avoiding this location if service  matters at all to you."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Milagro. I was craving tacos and decided to give them a try. Can't say that I was disappointed, but I was expecting 3 tacos instead of 2. They were tasty, albeit a little spicy. I'd probably come back to try other items on their menu, but the overall quantity to price ratio wasn't impressive."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations for this place (as the other two locations had terrible reviews) so you won't be too surprised with my report that this location sucks too.

We had a work function here so regardless of bad reviews, I could not bring myself to pass up free food and drink and mingle with colleagues.

Both the food and drink weren't actually half bad. What ruined the experience was THE SERVICE.

Oh god, the service...it was MUY HORRIBLE.

We had the entire 2nd floor rented for a group of 20. We had made the reservations far in advance and the food had all been pre-ordered so that we were all sharing. Thus, no reason that the kitchen should have had trouble dishing out the food quickly.

Upon arrival, I ordered a mojito. We had our own bar and bartender on the floor. She was quite sweet but she was so slow with the drinks - 15 minutes later our first round of mojitos and margaritas arrived. To be fair, they were quite good, but we were annoyed at waiting.

The appetizers (shrimp ceviche and guacamole) were meant to be out for our arrival time (5:30pm) but we didn't see any sign of food until 6:30pm or so. Then we waited another hour in between for the mains to arrive.

Considering it was Tuesday between 5-7pm and we had pre-booked far in advance, there was really no excuse for the slowness!

We had platters of shared tacos: Cochinita Pibil (pulled pork tacos), Poblanas (chicken with mole sauce) and some kind of beef enchiladas. 

The food was quite good - I like spicy, but we had a few people who couldn't eat much of anything because they found it too spicy.

We had trouble getting our drinks refilled throughout the meal. People were dying for water.

They did have a decent outdoor patio area on the back of the second floor which we made use of when we first arrived.

Decor - OK
Food - OK/pretty good
Drinks - pretty good
Service - completely inadequate!!!"}
{"text":"Milagro....I wanted to like you so bad. You are located in our friends building and anytime we have visited we have walked by and a \"yummy\" thought bubble popped into our heads. Well last night we finally decided to give it a try-yikes. Get.your.shit.together. The service was terrible, and the food was a star above Taco Bell. The hostess and the chip refiller guy were the friendliest. That's about it. Pretty disappointed and will not be returning. Ever.

Ps. Our waitress,younger chick with long light hair, no need to point out that \"the tip is not included in the total\" when using the credit card machine. We are from the states so we tip anyway even if your puss poor attitude and tacky tip comment along with bad service happened."}
{"text":"Slow service - not the friendliest, in fact some of them are so grumpy! Why? I really wanted to like you guys cause your menu looks great. That's the other thing, food seemes so appetizing on the menu but they were unfortunately rather bland. 
Really, really wished they would improve on both service and taste!"}
{"text":"great food, ambience and wonderful staff!! I had a large table booked and they served us quickly, the food came out in good timing considering the amount of orders being made at the table, and the staff were awesome."}
{"text":"The service here is appalling. I have been here a number of times and am always optimistic -- and always let down. It doesn't seem to matter who the host or server is, or whether or not they are busy. They are extremely slow at everything, from seating you to taking your order to getting the bill, and are not terribly accurate or diligent. Moreover, while not brusque, they are far from friendly enough to compensate for the ineptitude. 

Food is very good, probably 3.5 stars. Very reliable and decent portions. Margaritas are tasty. But goddamn the service sucks.

I'll have to give the one on Mercer a try."}
{"text":"Busy and bustling spot on Queen.  Prices were a little high and salsa was overly salty.  Mole poblano was quite yummy and is a huge portion.. Easily shareable!  Service was a bit slow but it was a great place to chat and linger if you have the time"}
{"text":"You might as well get Taco Bell.

Milagro is an upscale Mexican Cantina. I don't see a problem with the concept but I was quite disappointed with the execution.

You know you have a problem when your server at a so called authentic Mexican restaurant doesn't even speak Spanish. If I am paying so much for an authentic Mexican experience, I want my server to be Mexican (or Latin American at most).  If I wanted Mexican food served by white people, I would have gone to Taco bell.

Milagros Restaurant and Cantina is ridiculously overpriced. They charge $12 dollars for tiny flavourless taco.  Keep in mind that you can get a delicious taco at Tacos El Asador for $2.50. (And your food will be served by someone who actually speaks Spanish!)

The dish presentation leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered some Enchiladas with Mole and the dish looked very messy and unappealing. The enchiladas were unbelievably bland and tasteless. They fell apart way too easily.

There's nothing miraculous about Milagro. Except for the fact that it will take a miracle to convince me to go again.

Save some money. Go to Tacos El Asador on Bloor/Christie instead."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to the summerlicious event here as it was my first time at Milagro. Unfortunatly, the one item that I went there to have (which was on the summerlicious website menu) was not available at the restaurant. While I understand this is not the restaurants fault entirely,I feel we should have been treated more sympathetically by staff and given some sort of complimentary meal/drink/app to make up for it. Also, the summerlicious dinner menu here is not vegetarian friendly (I called ahead to make sure there were many choices and the person on the phone ensured me there was) but there was only one choice for main. My friends and I decided to leave without ordering our pre fixe and go to La Carnita instead as we felt we had more options there (Much better guacamole too) and better care from the staff at that establishment."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food! Great atmosphere and presentation. Guacamole you would kill for. Wednesday is cerveza night!"}
{"text":"I was hoping to be surprised, but I wasn't. The guacamole was salty ... Is that even possible ? The ceviche lacked fish. They ran out of everything we ordered. The plus side was the decor and the server was sweet . Oh, and the cucumber margarita was yummy."}
{"text":"Nice people, nice restaurant nice food. We had the mixed platter, a couple pitchers of margaritas and a good time. It was hopping and lively and a fun setting. We've been there twice send had a good experience each time."}
{"text":"I like Mexican food.  And, espesh, Baja-style tacos.  Oh, and guac.  Also, tequila gets me into trouble.  

So, yea, Mexican food is a good time for all parties involved.  Or, at very least: me.

I go to Milagro with some regularity, and it's definitely good in a pinch.  The half-order of guacamole is generous for a two-person starter.  The food doesn't shy away from heat when you want it.  The chips are greasy-good.  The drink options include tequila cocktails, sangrias and margaritas (more on those in the note, below).

My go-tos are the shrimp or the snapper tacos.  I especially like the latter and so, apparently, does the general clientele: last night the server happily informed me that I was ordering \"the most popular menu item!\".  The snapper is lightly beer-battered, topped with a crunchy slaw, and wrapped in a flour tortilla.  Dos to an order, unless you want the entree portion which also comes with beans and rice.  

It kinda bugs that when you ask for hot sauce you get a tiny thimble of stuff that you're charged $1.25 for but, well...it's dynamite-hot so I guess it _does_ pack an efficient punch. That said, Milagro isn't super cheap eats.   

Cute decor that borders on the type of kitsch I love: hammered tin Mexican ornaments, bright colours, melted down candles.  

Yelp note: they've recently started sweetening their margaritas with agave instead of sugar, and my taste buds register an improvement!"}
{"text":"Huge margaritas with massive flavour and super good food. Loved this spot with a big group of friends. The guac and chips were unreal. Nothing here is fancy but it's just good."}
{"text":"One of the finest examples of first rate Mexican cuisine in Toronto--and we've been long due! Came here on Monday when Jose-Luis was working. He greeted me warmly and promptly seated; checked in frequently, but not enough to feel interrupted. Overall? Perfect!

The ambiance has been well thought out and carefully executed, evoking ideas of sultry evenings spent with the help of a little tequila. The interior is intimate, but approachable with an full open wall/window onto Queen St. W. Rich red tones, bricks and slowly burning candles are on dynamic display here. 

Next: the food. I'd like to think I have high standards for Mexican food after spending several years surrounded by authentic Mexican dining in North Carolina. And Milagro had me impressed. Opting for a slightly higher end offering, the menu brings to life the other side of Mexican cuisine (read: not burritos on street corners--although that can be delicious too!). I was treated to a perfectly made margarita Milagro, which delighted with habanero bitters and smooth jimador reposado tequila. For the main course, I shared barbacoa pachuca--slow pasted lamb served in a banana leaf and mariscos zarandeados... a seafood mix of octopus, shrimp and tuna in achiote sauce with a playful pineapple salsa. 

Overall, a **very** highly recommended Mexican experience in the heart of Toronto. Come for the delicious world class cuisine... and stay for the fun serving staff and delightful atmosphere! 

I'll be back 100%"}
{"text":"Went on valentine's day so it was fairly busy.  The food was decent, I had the prix fixe menu which had appetizer, main course, dessert, and a glass of one of their signature drinks.  For the price, I didn't like it too much. It was probably the food that dissuaded my vote, so if I do return I think I would rather try something on the regular menu.  All in all, the service was good and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos and mango salad are really good!!! A must try!!  they also have delicious Mexican cocktails"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. (Should be 5 stars, but:) Some of the stupidest customer service decisions I've ever experienced. Located in downtown Toronto so plenty of business people undoubtedly frequent the place. Often business people can be reimbursed for their meal, as was the case for our group who were all attending a conference nearby, but Milagro refused to give us separate cheques. They claimed their system couldn't do it. We suggested pretending we were sitting at different tables. They still wouldn't do it. The next day I came back and upfront strongly requested separate cheques, citing my dissatisfaction with the previous day's experience. They did it that time! Which I was grateful for, but I'm not a fan of being lied to."}
{"text":"The maitre'd told us that the restaurant is special because it serves \"authentic\" Mexican food.  My thought?  It was a slight step above a Taco Bell, with prices about 5 times as much as a Taco Bell.  Case in point - my boyfriend ordered what he thought would be 4 tacos for $17 (ludicrous!), but ended up being 4 deep fried tortillas rolled with a bit of pork inside.  Needless to say, we all probably could've topped up our meai with some street meat on John St., we were that hungry aftewards.  The staff were at least friendly, when they didn't forget we existed!  They were INCREDIBLY slow  

I am pretty much convinced that anything in the \"entertainment district' of Toronto is crappy, so all that to say, if you are going out in this area try to go elsewhere first.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"I have to say the prices are prohibitive here. If you are looking for delicious food at a great price, this is not your stop. After a few drinks and some chips and salsa and an appetizer we were already starting $100 in the face. If we had been there for dinner or even if we had wanted a couple tacos to satisfy some actual hunger, we would have been homeless begging for toonies and loonies on the street.

The drinks were great though. The blueberry margarita and the bourban sangria were actually phenomenal. And the ceviche was magnificant. MAGNIFICANT.

So if you are a wealthy trust fund kid or of that generation that actually made some money, you'll be fine. If you're younger than 40 and not independently wealthy in some way then you probly should try one of the many other choices in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really good! I don't eat Mexican food much but probably bcos cheap places aren't that good. But here the guacamole was really good and the octopus cerviche was tastey! The churros were amazing! (On par to ones in Peru). Wasn't a fan of the beef taco though. Service and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"The southern inspired Mexican cuisine is unique.

The curried meat is served in a banana leaf. The cooked beans are intact, which heightens the taste.

They go way beyond tortillas and empanadas so beware. 

A truly delightful meal and at prices that don't break the bank."}
{"text":"I didn't believe the reviews I went there anyways because it was close to my hotel and because it \"looked\" nice. I order Enchilada Suizas and the chicken was bland as hell. To top it off what I read in the past reviews about their service is true!!! I was here Saturday night so it was a bit busier than usual but boy they are extremely inattentive. The service is terrible. Don't bother coming here. Go somewhere else where the food is better and service can be way better because I ain't coming back....."}
{"text":"Stopped in after checking out Queen St W, while passing thru Toronto.  What a pleasant surprise!  Excellent food & service!  We were thirsty after a day outside & our waiter kindly left 2 bottles of water on the table for us.  We did not have other drinks but the food was outstanding & great location.  Guacamole had nice lime & fresh cilantro taste!  We had chicken & vegetarian burritos too - both excellent & filling."}
{"text":"Reviewing: 2 Chicken tacos (\"Playeros\" consisting of roasted chicken, lettuce, pico de gallo, crema, in crisp tortilla) and their Guacamole.

First: it seems they offer customers unlimited nachos and salsa (great for the long wait they gave us for just 2 tacos). The nachos were fine, with a dash of salt. The slight sweetness of them balanced well with the salt, and the salsa was not memorable. This is a plus (considering Lonestar restaurant does not offer unlimited chips and salsa anymore).

The guacamole (large was $13, maybe a pounds worth) arrived and it was \"good.\" It had a chunkier texture and it was more of a \"guacamole salad\" with elements of tomatoes and other vegetables, than an avocado focused guacamole (a la Whole Foods, which is great BTW).

The tacos (2 small ones for about $10) took forever and they tasted more like they had scrambled eggs than chicken.
Overall, somewhat forgettable, but if you're on Queen West near Bathurst, this is the only decent Mexican restaurant in the area. 

The place had dim lighting (I liked) and music genre was Mexican ambience (no folk or traditional type music played). Great place to chat 1 on 1. Intimate contemporary vibe. 

I might go back to try other dishes if im around and need some Mexicanish food, or want to chat 1 on 1 with someone with no large crowds."}
