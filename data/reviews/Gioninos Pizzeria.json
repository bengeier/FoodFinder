{"text":"Used to love their food. Lately not so much. The pizza is not good as usual. It had less toppings and tasted different. Wings are slimy. Like my wings more crispy.  Order took forever to be delivered. Will reconsider ordering from them in future."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. Please go back to the good old days when you were the best pizza around! Today's Pizza was very greasy and not very good."}
{"text":"We get pizza here once a week! It really is the best pizza anywhere. Linda and her husband are very nice, and always stop to talk. All of the employees are courteous as well. Love them!!"}
{"text":"Gionino's is a pretty good pizza place. The Munroe Falls location (it's a Northeast Ohio chain) is in a small space in a strip mall that has seen better days. The space is small and meant just for take out; there's no dining in. I find the pizza to be pretty good. I had the barbecue chicken pizza, which was very good especially with the bits of bacon on it. The pepperoni was also very good. The cheese on both pizzas really helped make the pizzas so good. Overall, if you're looking for a good pizzeria, consider Gionino's."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended Gionino's a while back. We finally had the chance to try it recently and needless to say we were really pleased. The pizza is fantastic. The sauce is great, the cheese is really good, and the herbs and spices they add really bring the whole thing together. Their cheesy bread is also great. I've tried several of the pizza places in Twinsburg and this is the best."}
{"text":"Pretty gucci. Menu is large and exotic for a pizza place and the wings a very pleasing. Bread sticks are very good and different from most pizza places"}
{"text":"Best pizza shop fried chicken I've ever had.  Pizza is above average.  A little pricey, but definitely worth it, and coupons can usually be found in Golden Clipper, etc."}
{"text":"Easily our favorite pizza spot in town. Great pies across the board. It's the Deluxe that I love most, but a simple cheese is sublime as well.

What most folks may not know is they have a great selection of other food. We regularly get sandwiches, wings and their boss Jo-Jo fries. The meatball sub is amazing. 

The fried chicken here is absolutely the best. We have bought a tray of it for several parties, and folks rave.

What separates this location from the rest are the people. The owners are friendly and engaging, always a friendly chat when I'm in the shop. Makes it worth stopping in instead of delivery."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Salads are tasty my wife and I love the pop eye pizza. A little spendy but well worth it"}
{"text":"Called at 10:30 AM asking for a sheet pizza for 12 pm and was told they might not feel like making that because need to give 24 hours notice .

Called master Pizza and they were more then happy to deliver a sheet pizza at any time we wanted ."}
{"text":"Called over an hour before they close and was told there was no jojos or chicken because \"the fryers are already down\" and not even a sorry."}
{"text":"Good pizza and Jo-Jo's. Friendly staff to greet you. But.........like most pizza places, kind of expensive for what you get. Look for a coupon."}
{"text":"Service sucks. I've always said that everyone at every Gionino's sounds like Zydrunas Ilgauskas looks. Asked a guy if I could get my wings crispy - ya know, bc they are disgusting when they're undercooked - and he said: \"I can't guarantee anything\". Okay, nevermind then, dude. Takes forever to get a delivery. 

Usually the pizza is pretty good. I tend to like their smaller pizzas better - they tend to be better cooked. Jos and chicken are good, too, usually. I've had the steak sub. Not bad. 

Seriously, though, what's with the aloof attitude?"}
{"text":"The pizza here most of the time is good, but not great. The quality is truly hit-or-miss as is the service, whether pick up or delivery. I've found the staff to be somewhat friendly to out and out rude over the years. There are better options around the area (Altieri's, Emidios, Zeppe's, Luigi's), so I would only ever choose this place if I didn't feel like driving."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here many times. I've never had any issues and the food is always hot and delicious. The location is easy to access and there is plenty of parking. My favorite is the gionino bread. Try it with ranch!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. All the employees and owners son Dillard are so personable. Mel makes the best pizza. I now live in Beachwood and go to Gino's when I want good pizza, no others compare. No others compare."}
{"text":"I love Gioninos. I think it's my favorite pizza in the burbs. Seriously, most pizza places in the burbs leave little to be desired, but this Ohio local chain is fantastic. I've ordered online and done carry out both with no issues and always been a happy camper.

Yes, the prices are expensive, but you're getting what you pay for. We always get the Hawaiian with fresh mozzarella, and it's so delicious it's almost rude. The minute you take a bite, you essentially realize you've been eating cardboard everywhere else.

Also, there's a Gioninos billboard near Hopkins Airport that says \"You could buy a cheap pizza, but then you'd have to eat it.\" True that, Gioninos."}
{"text":"This is are home town pizza place they are great in a pinch and on the other side/ our side I the train tracks.  Also have great coupons most of the time for parties.  I like they are so close and there chicken and jo-Jo's are a must if you debating on adding to your pizza order.  Deluxe pizza is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is OK  I have experienced better.  The problem with this restaurant is while new to the area I was looking for a regular pizza place to order from.  We would call and pick up the pizza and the taste was OK, nothing fabulous.  
One day I called and for delivery and they detected from my voice that I was African American, they responded with a racist response \"we do not deliver to certain areas..because we had a driver robbed\"  (basically assuming I lived in this so called bad area of town) well first of all I do not live in that area, I live in a new upscale development that is multiracial.  They assumed all Blacks lived in this one area, I was so offended I had a hard time supporting this restaurant and still do. 
I called the restaurant  with a complaint to the manager and found out that was the manager who responded this way.

My conclusion
1.  Do not assume all live in a certain area because of their race.
2   Do not assume that refusing to deliver to certain areas will make your driver safer."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Love the soft doughy crust, not too thin but not deep dish. We got the garden pizza and the deluxe and both were fantastic. I've missed this style of Italian pizza. The sauce was sweet, and the sausage was just crumbly enough. I was taken a back by the small size of the small for the price but, it was good enough to forgive."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for more than 15 years. Used to have great food and service. Today we went to pick up our pizza and wings at the designated time and was told the wings had another 10 minutes. It actually took 30 minutes from the initial pick up time to get our wings. Our other food sat for 30 minutes thus was cold. The staff really didn't care or try to make it right. Because if this we are no longer customer and will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Punk kids running the show, WAY WAY WAY overpriced, and when they got the order wrong TWICE and refused to do anything about it (laughingly), I was done.

A complaint to their website to the supposed owners? Laughed at as well. Better pizza elsewhere for much cheaper prices without the crap attitudes."}
{"text":"After working at this pizza shop for almost 14 years you think I'd be sick of the food. Not the case at all. I could still eat their pizza every day. Best pizza around. Recommend the Gionino's Best with a side of white sauce for dipping."}
{"text":"Man just like all the gioninos there food is to die for. I love love love the jo jos. The employees are awesome. Very fun and energetic. I would recommend this place to friends and family for sure. ALso check out there awesome loyalty program. awesome."}
{"text":"They have ripped us off more than once on the count. How hard is it to count out eight pieces of chicken and fourteen jojo's.?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why my original review didn't mention the fried chicken and jo-jos! They have the best."}
