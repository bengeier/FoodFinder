{"text":"Awesome place... I work alot, want time and want what I want no questions asked. Delivered what I needed and good relax time. Perfect place to chill with no pressure."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and found out they have a new chef. I had the Ceasar Salad and shared a Mahi Mahi with Kale and quinoa. Both meals were fantastic and a step up from what they tried to do with the fried Caesar Salad the last chef would do. Fantastic! Will be going back again for the food."}
{"text":"First gentlemen's club I went to where I didn't fell like I needed a shower after due to the sleaze. 

I saw a lot of postings about a, \"bitch bartender.\" Didn't interact with the bartender, but the waitress and dancers were sweet as pie... so maybe they remedied the problem. 

Very classy place with formal runway and layout. Feels like a real club, not some trailer with dirty poles. As funny as it sounds you can bring a SO here for an actual date. 

The girls dance and do what's advertised without soliciting a, \"private menu.\" Making me not feel uncomfortable. I want a sexy dance, not a charge or disease thanks... that had driven me from other clubs in the past but didn't happen here. 

My wife came with me and had fun as well.. Saturday is couples night so we were not charged a cover. 

Drinks are realistically priced and the food is good, but buy on special or you'll get a hefty bill. 

We're going to return here again."}
{"text":"Strippers were ok at best.   Late night go somewhere else.   They don't want your business"}
{"text":"Beware....if you go to this strip club.....you will get robbed by David, Carlos, or joffe...managers and floor man pimp certain girls out in the club...girls are giving them almost all their money for putting them with a customer and they also overcharge your credit card to their personal benefit...several lawsuits pending due to fraud....be careful....you have been warned!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best strip clubs ever. Extremely classy and upscale, the only strip club I've been to in the country (I've been to a lot) where the majority of girls are attractive. Every flavor that can appeal to every man's fantasy, a perfect place to find exactly what you're looking for. You get the best of the best here, and as a bonus they have excellent food. Better than Vegas, Miami, and California, definitely one of the top adult entertainment establishments around."}
{"text":"This is the best club anywhere!  I travel the county and I've been to plenty.  But ever since I stepped into The Men'sClub in Charlotte, I can't go to another one.   They  spoiled me.  I even try to make long layovers in Charlotte just so I can go.  
Food is really good.  And they might even make something not in the menu. ( I really wanted a grilled cheese one  night). Management is awesome. Very friendly.  
Waitress was wonderful. Ask for Heidi. I never have an empty glass.  She takes care of me like I am her only customer.  She'll do the same for you.  
Dancers are beautiful. All of them.  Really cannot go wrong.  I am particular to Gia. She's awesome. 
Don't just stay downstairs.  Spend some money and try the upstairs.  It's worth it.  Try to go on the third Wednesday of the month. It's half price bottles upstairs.  Best deal ever!!!
Best club in Charlotte or anywhere."}
{"text":"I have been here more times than I can count. Some might even say I am an aficionado of under dressed women and moderately priced drinks. If you ever find yourself in or around Charlotte, this is the place to stop. Gorgeous buffet and tasty women. Please tip the kitchen staff

The management staff is unlike most places of this nature. Will, and the rest of them make you feel like you're part of a private club. They recognize you as soon as you pull up to the front door and step out of your certified pre owned luxury vehicle. They walk you to the best seating available, you feel like Moses parting the red sea. They offer a menu that is classier than some of the nicest restaurants in the area. They are always knowledgeable about what drink specials they have going on. 
They even come back and check on you, if you look sad and lonely they will bring you a beautiful young lady. Please tip management 

The gentleman who squirt s liquid soap on your hands and gives you a little towel in the bathroom can only be compared to a classic gentleman from the late 1920s jazz era. He is always dressed in a stylish suit. Always quick with the small talk. Always rocking the best tunes. In fact I have never heard the same song twice in the bathroom. Please, don't be dirty... Wash your damn hands people. And while you're at it. Tip the bathroom attendant (at least a $5 spot) 

It goes without saying, tip the ladies well. These women are working hard to get through dental school, or beauty school, or veterinarian school, or sometimes just to get a boob job. 

And trust me! If you thought I was done there. You're crazy. If Tara is not your waitress, you missed out. Not only is she a Goddess amongst pheasants. She is effing hilarious. She's kind. She's honest. She's downright the coolest, baddest chick in there. I would go there just to see her if that wasn't creepy. Make sure you tip her. She is one of the hardest working people I've ever had the pleasure to meet. 

Sincerely,
A somewhat dirty gentleman who spends a fair amount of time in the men's club..."}
{"text":"I went this Wednesday for the $10 buffet and it was pretty good.  I knew where the place was so finding it wasn't hard and parking at a little before noon was easy.  Me and a coworker paid and went in, I like the stuffed chairs but it was a waste when I was sitting half out of it to eat.

I don't know if the food changes but this week I saw boneless pork chops, fried chicken, buffalo shrimp, baked salmon and plenty of sides. Dessert bar had cheesecake, fruit, a variety of cookies and more. One note, drinks are not included and they don't tell you refills are charged the same, we ended up paying an additional $12 for that.

The only downsides were that the strippers were quite pushy trying to give overpriced dances ($25) and the dress code was not being enforced, plenty of shorts and tshirts. This will end up being a once a month kinda lunch for us."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a while.
A great place to bring a spouse, very comfortable atmosphere low-pressure good service the quality of talent in the building is above average.
X
Been there for lunch not fantastic but I may have gotten better there recently not sure."}
{"text":"Still a wonderful club!  They revamped their menu again and added a bunch of delicious new choices.  Their handcrafted cocktails have changed;  I thoroughly enjoyed the Southern Gentleman.  I heard they added the breakfast buffet to Thursday nights as well, although I haven't been able to try it out...yet."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Jenn and Carlos took care of me. Alot of girls. The food is one of the best places in Charlotte. Believe me"}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been to    No service or women. I would never come in this place ever again.  Women are not attractive and staff is even worse.

Beer is almost $8 with no girls in sight.  What a joke.  This place is the worst place I've ever been to and I've been all over the world."}
{"text":"This is by far the best strip club in Charlotte. I come here on Wednesdays for the lunch buffet during the day which is always a steal for 10$ all you can eat plus admission into the club. Otherwise I usually come on Friday or Saturday night when its packed with girls. The seating is comfortable and 1 large stage and three mini side stages. Girls are friendly and most are above a 7. Dances are 20$ and worth every penny."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place after a night of drinks. We were there on a Friday night - place was kind of slow. Most of the ladies said the week had been unusually slow but around 1:30 am a good crowd started building. Dancers are rotated thruought the night and there was a wide range. All in all we had a good time for the $. Waitresses were very attentive, the dancers were respectful - as in both tines I bought my   husband lap dances the asked if I minded how close the got to him (answer was no of course). Drinks were strong like we like them and the entertainment was appealing. We'll go again for sure."}
{"text":"Usually I really like this place and go often BUT I had a rotten experience here last night that has ruined my opinion of this place forever. 
I went with a friend at night and ordered drinks. I gave a card and ID for my tab and my friend paid for drinks with cash as he got them. At the end of the night My friend checked out and then I paid the bill. I then found out that our waitress was billing my friends drinks to my tab while she's pocketing cash from my friend.
I had to sign for the bill and the manager essentially told me to take a long walk off a short pier. 
Usually this place quite good but at night it turns to a den of thieves."}
{"text":"The military appreciates your support. I love titties. I love bacon. Best strip club I've been to."}
{"text":"I came to The Men's Club of Charlotte with DJ Evo and some friends. We had a great time. Leah was our Bartender. She was excellent and helpful with recommending some great drinks. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Love the place, very friendly staff and definitely the hottest girls in town. Nonpushy girls which is a big plus. Very classy and clean, definitely not your typical strip club. The food is very good and reasonably priced. Check it out, you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better clubs in Charlotte; I would say for the best quality girls vs. price. The girls here are good to above average in looks. There are very few tattoos here. Safe to go alone here and they will valet your car if you want.

They have several stages and the headliner for the current song will be front and center. There are at least 2-3 other small stages where they rotate every song. 
This is one of the best in Charlotte, quality girls at the fairest prices. 

They are friendly here but they usually ask you if you want a dance before sitting at your table. They won't spend time with you here if you aren't willing to spend some money. These aren't the fun type girls... they are obviously there for one thing and that's to drain your pockets.

Lunch here is great, it's a 4-5 star quality meal for a reasonable price... it's very hard to leave here and return to work though. The girls are very polite and won't bother you during lunch unless you specifically ask for them.

FYI: No smoking in any bar or restaurant anywhere in North Carolina. If they have a drink special it has to last all day... no happy hours. Sorry but it's NC law."}
{"text":"OMG, what is the problem? $30 for a couple to come in at 0100! Things we dont want to do while we're checking out hot chicks is stuff our face with a fattening breakfast! Ridiculous! You should have a \"not eating\" option but still interested in having a few drinks. Was truly a waste of time."}
{"text":"So...considering the wife has now written her review I think that allows me to write mine :). Went here for a business lunch a few months ago and was leery of it for obvious reasons. Drove up to the place with my colleagues and the place was packed for lunch. Paid the $10 cover which was for the lunch and was seated at the table in the back of the room near the food. Food was great and what I had heard about it prior was backed up by the food I ate...one of the best buffets in town (food wise...ha). Service was spot on and non intrusive.

You'll see everything here. Women and men meeting for business. Guys in suits indulging in the \"non-food buffet\" and pretty ladies. Overall...great spot Charlotte, though I have nothing to compare it to in town. . For info on that I'll need to continue to read Jay R's reviews! ha."}
{"text":"This establishment is definitely worth checking out - it has a 4 star restaurant that's open until 1am! Not a lot of places have excellent food including prime filet and lobster until that late at night - they also have a beautiful wonderful friendly staff - my favorite waitress is Jen - she's prompt, courteous - always made sure my drinks were full, and informed me of all the amenities in the place - she was friendly so it was really fun to go into a brand new place and have someone so informative and courteous. I was definitely taken care of in this place and upstairs is amazing - they have a huge wine and champagne selection - vip is classy clean and comfortable. I recommend checking out this place any day/night of the week and make sure you ask for my favorite waitress - Jen - she will make sure you have an awesome amazing time."}
{"text":"overpriced. food was okay. a bit boring better clubs in the area, waitresses are rude and dont seem to smile much-hey management when I come to a strip joint I want to see young HOT waitresses serving me-not miserable 50 year old women who are out of shape. HIRE NEW GIRLS THEY ARE RUDE!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give a definite 5 star review to the men's club of Charlotte - I had one of the best experiences with my waitress Jenn, I went in on a busy Friday night around midnight the place was really busy but had a good vibe to it I honestly thought I would have poor service because of how busy it was but I was surprised. Carlos the manager introduced himself (I don't even get that at regular restaurants or bars) and took me on a tour of the whole place including upstairs vip. There is a great wine list and delicious food menu, there were a couple guys I met there that told me they just go for the food because yes it's that good. Jenn my waitress took her time to explain the menu to me since I had never been there - I didn't feel rushed at all, she was super friendly and informative. I ordered a kick ass filet entree and it is literally one of the best filet's I have ever had. What I also liked about Jenn was that she remembered my name and she also took the time to tell me about the future events and offered to add me on the guest lists for upcoming events. She also introduced me to several of her staff and made me feel welcomed. I wasn't pressured in to any dances or having to Tip dancers or whatever the case it felt like a legit restaurant business with entertainment if you will. Definitely ask for Jenn to be your waitress, I will definitely be visiting again. I don't usually visit business of this nature but it honestly has great customer service and some of the best food I've had so far here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really like there Wednesday buffet a little of everything even desserts look great, my biggest complaint is if you get like tea or coke like 3 bucks and comes out in  small glasses and the dam Nazis charge for refills, one would think we'll ill drink water but it's the same thing wtf. What's up for a buck boom"}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about the Men's Club is the buffet on Wednesdays.  It is a very large and well prepared selection of food, meats, salads, seafood, you name it!!  As far as the other things that I have to say, not so complimentary. In my opinion, the MC is a lot of flash and waste of money.  The dancers are snooty and stuck-up.  I have been in for lunch, ate, and left without ever seeing a dancer. When you do see a dancer, most of them are average at best. I assume nights are better, but I don't intend to waste my time or money there."}
{"text":"A nice gentlemen's club with unlimited breakfast buffet at 3am! That was the main reason we came, so other than that, I'm not sure I can definitively describe to you how the dancing or girls were. The place itself is actually pretty nice, which is probably why it is classified as a \"gentlemen's\" club and not just a strip club. If I remember correctly, there are two levels, with the stage in the middle of the room and an open view of both levels surrounding it. It was very loung-y and comfortable with an enigmatic vibe. I don't know many nightclubs or gentlemen's clubs that serve breakfast, so this was pretty cool for a fair price (of about $15)."}
{"text":"This is by far the nicest place in Charlotte to go as far as a men's club. They have a nice breakfast which is actually pretty good after 2 a.m. The girls for the majority are good looking. The ambiance is very nice and the complimentary valet is nice! I def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of American and especially Charlotte strip clubs.  Had my full of the Canadian Ballet when I lived on the border at the Ontario drinking age of 19 and that was 1000x better.  I am also really not a fan of strip clubs that serve food, but this is an exception.  It's close to work and they have awesome lunch specials every weekday.  People rave about the Wednesday lunch buffet, but I go here for me red meat craving on free steak Fridays.  You get a free 10 ounce, decent ribeye plus $2 sides and it's all good.  They hit you on the drink at $3.85 for soda, but I don't know where else in town you can get a decent 10 ounce steak, two good sides, and a drink for $8.  They get crowded on Friday so the service can be a little bit slow, but it's not too bad.  The food really is good here...there is no question about that."}
{"text":"After everywhere else closes at 2am, this place certainly livens up as it seems half of uptown ends up here. You pay a cover to get in the door which also nets you a free breakfast. The breakfast is pretty good, i stacked my plate with a cooked to order western omelet, grits, bacon, and gravy and biscuits. Very tasty and a huge breakfast. The girls are all very attractive, yet some of them seem a little unenthusiastic compared to other clubs I've been to. The Men's Club does have a couple advantages in my opinion to Uptown Cabaret though. It's larger and much easier to get a table, and feels more upscale. I just don't feel as dirty as I do in other strip clubs. There's a bathroom attendant, a well stocked bar, and a wine room. If you have a few stacks to drop I believe you could have a pretty great night. Long story short, skip IHOP or the Waffle House for your Friday night munchies and come here for dinner and a show."}
{"text":"Okay so I ended up here for breakfast one day at around 4am after a very drunken night. That said I thought the food was perfectly fine.

The breakfast is served buffet style and I thought the price was quite reasonable. Really I'm quite tolerant towards breakfast food. It can be pretty terrible and I'll still probably like it. If it's good that's a bonus! I just like eggs a whole lot okay? I realize the irony in that statement. Don't judge me! The dancers are in a pretty separate section so that makes me feel safer about the food.

Would I go back? Probably not unless it's after a rough night out where I somehow end up here again. But the place is just fine for food, and probably ladies if you're into that."}
{"text":"My favorite club in Charlotte. Great food & drink and an excellent selection of ladies."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit and have been to many different gentleman's clubs in USA and Canada.   The Mens Club of Charlotte ranks in the top.  This place is very clean, and the ambience is great.  The managers Will and Joeff were professional, freindly, acomadating and made my visits super comfortable.   They serve food till 1am and I had very good filet mignon.
My server Miranda was great and 1 of the reasons i will always go to The Mens Club when in Charlotte NC.  I must mention the women at  this club are ,Hot, freindly, and they don't pressure you for dances.  My favorite young lady is Kelly.  Kelly is beautiful pleasant, and I recommend requesting her if you ever go there.  My experience with her on two different nights was A++, 5 Star and both times  a memorable experiences.    If you ever have the chance The Mens Club of Charlotte is the place to visit"}
{"text":"If I had a .5 star system it would probably be 2.5.. I came here after the club to get some of their \"amazing\" breakfast... And since I was there might as well see what they offer entertainment wise.

It was actually a let down. I believe some other venues had a more worthy note and memorable moments for me, but this one wasn't. The food was okay, I honestly do say that it is really over hyped. Or I think it was just whoever came here were drunk.

And what really surprised me was that there was no pole dancing! For a club like this, and no pole? Interesting. I think this is probably the first and last time I come here because it was over priced and honestly, I felt it wasn't worth my while."}
{"text":"As a traveling, young, free and fun female I am always compelled to leave reviews for Gent's Clubs as mostly people don't take the time or don't know what to say.... so here it goes Yelpers! 
Note: this was a Friday night visit midnight to 4am

This is true gentlemens' club, great decor, sophisticated swag, diverse music selection, quality ladies which there's something for every gent (or chic if that's your thing) here.  They actually performed on stage and I saw/partook in a real lap dance.  My guy friend and I were happy to witness this. 
Food was FREAKIN' GOURMET! I've never experienced such an amazing blackened fish served over cheese grits ever in my life! $20...it was a good look. 
Dope VIP area, if I was hosting a bachelor party for my homeboys, I'd take them here
I didn't partake in the buffet b/c I just finished my dinner but I noticed around 2am peeps started to pile in for the breakfast buffet, looked good but can't testify to it. 

On this note... if you're cheap, don't come here; if you're looking for ratchet, don't come here - but sophisticated turn up that's super fun, come here. If you're cheap don't come here... oh yeah I did say that. You will pay for the quality, ambience and experience but hey I'm with it, these ladies are there to work. Go have fun!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so let's be honest here people it's a strip club with beautiful half naked ladies. That alone says 5 stars but hey let's throw in the fact that they have an amazing lunch buffet on Wednesday and Friday oh and did I mention half naked ladies?  Plus if that's not enough there's a little hottie named Julissa who happens to be the best waitress there oh and I call dibs, I saw her first. Now this is just during the day, the hotties start strolling in as the night goes on and it only gets better. If your looking for a skinny little thing with a rocking body ask for Dallas.  If your looking for a nice chested put it all in your face sexy mama who by the way doesn't speak English then ask for Pamala. But if you want to see the hottest girl there that I drool over then sit in Julissa's section cause damn has she got it going on!!!!!!!  So maybe I'll see you there but not likely cause I'm to busy checking out the ladies to notice any of the customers."}
{"text":"Arrived as a single female and was told they'd let me in, but that I was not allowed to talk to any other customers.

Rather than take measures to ensure solicitation does not occur without impacting all customers experience (male and female), they'd rather take an all or nothing approach and send an unnecessary message putting the onus onto the customer and negatively impacting their experience. It's a poor way to run a business and not one I'd choose to spend money at."}
{"text":"Awesome decorum. Shockingly expensive and inappropriately charged for 2 drinks. My date and I literally only customers on a cold Thurs night. Sat in main room for 30 mins with no dancer in sight or on stage. Bartender played confused, made typical excuses for lazy dancer behavior. Finally one awoke from her nap and did rather avg performance. We courtesy tipped her to see if we could inspire the scene but to little avail. Finally bored we requested our check. I handed bartender waitress a $20, which she then noted in a nice way that it was $24.00. No consideration at all for the petty output. Question is, why open a mega club like this or keep it open with such piss poor presentation or customer appreciation? Make no mistake the owners of this club are obviously wealthy but none of that reward in their world was shown to us in basic clientele ways. Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"\"you're lucky your signature matches your ID\"........ says the bartender (Anne) after you just left a $60 tip for her, and way after they've taken an id and credit card from you the second you walk in. No good deed goes unpunished, apparently. I'd skip this place, not what it once was."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Beautiful women. You definitely are paying for quality. Worth every penny. It's a very classy establishment, clean and the best club in charlotte."}
{"text":"Not really impressed by this place. I was only in there for about half a hour. Then I bounced. I had more fun, at Paper Dolls. From some reason, this place doesn't excite. Maybe, I just went on the wrong night or something."}
{"text":"This is the only strip club in town that I would order food from.  Best part is that the food is awesome!  Girls are friendly and this is just a really classy place; so much so that I may even bring my wife next time!"}
{"text":"BORING! Not a single pole in the place so the girls amble on to the stage as if they just woke up. They walk from one side of the stage to the next doing nothing because they might trip and break the ankle. There is no pole on the stage thus nothing to hold on to to try to bust some moves.

This place is pretentious and over priced. The girls there have no talent and don't really care."}
{"text":"We had to beg girs for lap dances and at the end nobody showed up, service was slow as hell, and all the girls said I'm going upstairs and they never came back. Uptown cabaret it is next time!!!"}
{"text":"Please note that this review is for their Wednesday buffet, not the ladies or their gyrations. 

So, a friend and biz associate invited me out to what she quoted as \"the best buffet in Charlotte\" at The Men's Club. Skeptical as I was, I accepted as I love a great buffet. Plus she mentioned that there is a whole wall of desserts and that pretty much sealed the deal. I lunched with two female associates and one male associate. 

The venue: Yup, it's a strip club. All day. These ladies are working hard for their money. However, the space itself is really nice. It's clean, it's pretty, it's, well, almost luxe looking - at least in the semi dark dining area. 

The staff: Our waitresses were nice, efficient and fully clothed. That made digging into the buffet much easier. 

The food: Delicious. Seriously. It's a magical buffet full of so many different types of cuisines. Chef Brian is really nice and he was hanging out by the prime rib - yes, the actual meat - that is not a metaphor for something else. Everything was cooked well and there was enough variety for any palate. Big hits here: mac 'n cheese, asian chicken, perfectly steamed veggies and a nice fresh fruit spread. The dessert section wasn't at large as I thought but it filled the void for my sweet tooth.

Overall: Would I go back? Sure, for the Wednesday buffet. My meal was taken care of by one of my dining partners, but for these 70+ buffet options the cost was $10 per person. If you can stomach viewing a bit of T&A during your lunch, definitely give this stellar buffet a try. Just don't face the stage and make sure to hide your singles."}
{"text":"Haven't been back yet, but this is a follow up to my review. Ten or 12 days after my visit where I had to give them my drivers license with the credit card I get a letter from that credit card bank.  Seems like there was suspicious activity on the card and they issued me a new card!  Its one thing to get a phone call from the fraud security people and its a completely whole new level of WTF when the bank says - lets just issue the new card and tell him to hurry up and activate it............I SUPPOSE it could be pure coincidence that this place \"needed\" my drivers license and then a week or two later the fraud activity happens......or not!"}
{"text":"The club is above average in appearance for this kind of establishment. We had dinner, the skirt steak was great , the fried shrimp was a let down. They were flattened out and tough. 
Now about the dancers, wow what a let down. Pretty much the same old tattooed and pierced dancers from all the other clubs. Hard to find one to get a dance. Most of them had the attitude of an \"artist\" than a stripper. There were a couple of fun attractive girls, but it was disappointing to see the average strippers at an above average club.
After we ate we went somewhere else. We came back about two hours later and the place stunk of vomit. Hard to believe someone got that drunk on the overpriced watered down drinks.
I've been to many stripclubs and this was not the worst, but far from the best . Lots of potential maybe a change in management or ownership would help. Sorry but my dollars will be spent where my business is appreciated!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Both times I was forced to pay for breakfast even though I didn't want it. Both times they refused to actually give me the breakfast after I paid for it. Keep in mind, we're talking about a bunch of powdered eggs here. Not exactly a five course meal at the Ritz. Also keep in mind most patrons are spending a few hundred dollars apart from the $10 breakfast. 

Otherwise, generally sub par club. Would avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Very upscale and friendly.  Favorite is the kick-ass filet for dinner.  Great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"One of the best clubs I've ever been to. There are a bunch of hot girls,  the waitstaff is also very good looking, and they do have great service. The food is not something you would expect because you feel you're at Del Frisco's when you're eating there, their steaks are awesome, and they have great buffets. The manager that took care of me seemed to actually care about my experience, and I'll def be back"}
{"text":"My friends have been trying to drag me here for 'the best lunch buffet in Charlotte' for four years and I've been putting it off for, uh, four years. This week I am not traveling and I had no good excuses. I've never been to one of these places (yeah, I know all men say that but it's true or I would have Yelped it) so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.

The club itself is very nicely appointed. Comfortable carpet, lit enough that you can see mostly where you're going. Large wing chairs surrounding a smaller table. Lots of random stage lights, loud dance music and no outside light.

The ladies on the stage start off with clothes on, and then they quickly remove them. They are as naked as Meck County and North Carolina allow them to get. While I managed to snag the seat that wasn't facing the stage directly, there was still a lot of eye candy about, from our bustier and mini-skirt dressed waitress (her name is 'Hollywood') to the dancers (before and after their stage time) asking if we wanted company at our table and the ones who did offer 'company' to some of the tables nearby. The ladies are quite... flexible and... friendly. The lap dances were lengthy and very hands on (above the waist). I have no doubt that the place is completely above board and that there are no 'special deals' going on in the side rooms.

As for the buffet, it was a good deal at $10 plus $3 for an ice tea and $4 to tip the waitress who kept our glasses full and removed dirty plates quickly. A good selection of dinner-type items - beef tips, blackened chicken pasta, meatballs, chicken parmigiana, pork tenderloin. All hearty meaty items. There were some lighter choices, but not many. For dessert, a carved fruit platter, a big plate of handmade cookies, cheesecake and a carrot cake.

I don't see me being here outside of the lunch hours and even then, probably not."}
{"text":"I've been many times before and always had a good time. However, after our horrendous experience on New Years, it would take a lot of convincing to go back.
Our waitress, Tee, was ATROCIOUS. We were literally at tables directly next to the bar, and she had to take orders one-two at a time, walk over and give the order, then come back. At one point she told us she hadn't had a party this big ever (there was 12 of us). Fine, forgivable. Well, she couldn't remember in those ten steps what half the drinks were and would come back multiple times to get everything. She brought my husband and our friend the wrong drinks (not her fault) but one was a shot and they realized it was wrong after they did it. Her response? \"Well why did you drink it?\" Were they supposed to spit it out??
Friends of ours tried to get their tab, and she had trouble explaining the club's ridiculous policy (which we have NEVER heard in probably a dozen previous trips) of requiring the exact same signature on the slip as is on the driver's license they held on to. Our friend has a cochlear implant, so it was difficult to understand in a loud club. Eventually, she explained it to her husband and they worked it out. However, the waitress MADE FUN of them after they left!! She was so bent out of shape that she had to explain the policy \"to her like six times *exasperated sigh*\". I said \"she's deaf.\" Her response \"yeah well I'm half deaf in here too. And I had to explain it to BOTH of them.\" Um not quite, sweetie.
At this point, I'm heated and ready to finish my drink and go. Well unfortunately, she disappeared for at least twenty minutes. I went up to the bartender and asked if he had our checks or if he could find our waitress. Eventually she returns, obviously annoyed that I interrupted whatever else she was doing. We ask for our check, and she explains the bill signing policy. Ok, whatever, just get my check. She gives our friend his check, then walks away. When she comes back to get his, we had to ask her again. She requires us to sign the check before she'll give us back my husband's card and ID. She says \"she has to bring the signature to her manager to confirm before giving it back.\" That only smells slightly fishy, but so far our credit card statement is correct (unlike 2 other friends in our party).
What tipped me over the edge and led me to write this review is what took place after we left. If I was rude as she was, I wouldn't expect an overly generous tip. We gave about 10% (she deserved $0), and she had the gall to complain to our friends about it after we left!!! 
I'll find another club in Charlotte to enjoy on our next night out, thanks to this lovely experience..."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  When I first moved to Charlotte in '04 this was one of my favorite spots to hit.  The Wednesday lunch buffet was killer and the weekend breakfast buffet was equally awesome.  The girls ranged from night to night, but overall it was a solid showing.

Moving back to Charlotte in '10 we went back to our old stomping grounds for more fun and frivolity.  Like an amusement park you used to go to as a kid we were saddened to see our awesome fun park degraded into a washed up shadow of its former self.

It's strange, when the management changed they prettied up the place with a wine cellar and a second floor expansion yet everything else in the place went to shit.  The quality of the ladies took a drastic hit.  Last night's Saturday roster is what I would expect to see on a Tuesday afternoon.  Also, the security was not as sharp as it used to be.  One time at the breakfast buffet a fight broke out between two groups of Asians right by the omelette station.  Instead of well dressed bouncers swooping down to disperse the crowd the fight just fizzled out on its own with no interaction from security whatsoever.

I used to recommend this place to everyone coming through Charlotte for its fun atmosphere and good food.  Now I can barely recommend the food and would honestly steer my friends to other places."}
