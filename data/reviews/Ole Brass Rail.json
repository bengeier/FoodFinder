{"text":"I love this place. They have the cheapest and best breakfast food I've ever had. They make the best bacon in all the land!!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and has a suprisingly tasty breakfast and the food is VERY reasonable priced.  They have Blue Moon on tap, so be sure to get a \"Blue Moon & O.J.\" instead of a mimosa with brunch.

Live band on the weekend nights is very entertaining but can be a bit too loud for conversation.  TVs just about everywhere provide excellent coverage for whatever game(s) are on.

This place isn't flashy, but it's always clean.  Just be aware that you'll end up smelling like a deep fryer after spending any amount of time in here.

The crowd is always friendly and the service is usually top notch."}
{"text":"Great place! Good food, great service, great prices! Good place to watch a game. Great place to get breakfast (served every day until 2pm). You rarely have to ask someone for a drink or food - they're on top of their service. The people who go there are friendly and will make conversation with you. I had heard god things about Old Brass Rail, but had not had a chance to go until the past six months or so. Have not had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"If you want a good cheap breakfast this is the place to go. There food is very good and reasonably priced. I try to get there at least once a weekend. Very nice atmosphere. Seems like a good neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO STARS I would. I am a night shift nurse and and years ago would frequent this place to offload after long shifts in the morning. Loved it. The food, the staff, and drinks are all great. 

Fast forward years later. I have kids now and never really get adult time due to childcare.  This am 6/23/17 I got off work and clock out at 0738.  I realize I can relive my younger years because my kids are out of town with their grandparents while both my husband and I work. I had a couple beers with my friends and they being the friends they are, insisted I not drive since I rarely drink. I got a ride from my friend who took me back before my next shift at 6:30 pm. I see my car being towed. The guy would not put it down despite me being in scrubs saying my vehicle was there for 2 days and to go talk to the manager. I proceed to go talk to him and of course the guy drives off. 

The manager/owner lies and says the car has been there for 2 days and that he has a brother who goes there every morning at 0400-0500 every morning whom saw my car there. These are both impossible as the car was with me at the hospital I work at during this time.  The manager/owner complains and states that due to my car being parked (in a parking space no less) was unable to get the dumpster emptied because it was in the way.  I now have to wait until Saturday afternoon to make an appointment and bring $180 cash to get it out. I cannot believe that this happened. I am very displeased that this place that myself and co-workers have come to for many years has done this. I suppose parking in a parking space, being responsible, not driving home after drinking, and taking care of others doesn't pay off. 

I ask the multiple patrons from multiple healthcare establishment to please go elsewhere for business. This is quite an unfortunate event for a place that used to be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Ventured to this place for one reason: near-to-home karaoke. The reviews were mixed - some proclaiming excellence and others less than stellar but none of them regarding the karaoke. I wanted to see for myself.

One, the parking is dismal. But, if needed, the post office is only half a block away with a nice big lot and available for parking (which is where I parked the Saturday I went).

Two, the place is a dive bar - nothing more, nothing less. When I arrived, there were several people at the bar and several groups at the tables. Karaoke was in full swing and there were singers up. When sitting at the bar, I was immediately served by a male bartender with an easy smile.

Three, beer. The selection is fairly standard, the commonplace brews you can find in most bars - Bud, lites, Mich, etc. I was happy to find Woodchuck served, and not just served but on tap. (This is the only place - bar or liquor store - I've found since moving from the Midwest that offers my favorite hard cidar. I'm sure there are more, just haven't found them yet.) The price was a little steeper for that Woodchuck though than I'm accustomed. But that could be since the company that makes it is a small brewery in the Midwest and do not commonly distribute this far west.

Four, Karaoke DJ. A nice wooden dance floor was where the DJ made house for karaoke. Decent set up (one more like I'm used to with a lap top instead of cartridges like a few places I've seen since moving here), and a decent selection. I think he had books available, but he said it is often easier to simply write the song you want down and, if he has problems, he'd let you know. I was happy to see he had several bands/artists that are a little less known karaoke-wise that I enjoy to sing.

The DJ did sing, unlike some places where they refuse. But it wasn't an issue as the rotation wasn't overly long, and he was good about weaving new people into the existing line up. There were singers (like all places) with good voices and others without. It's not an overly young crowd. I'd say late twenties and up.

The only annoyance was the sound system was wonky. There was really only one or two good places to stand with the microphone to keep feedback out of the speakers. For someone like me who likes to sit in their seat, instead of standing on the dance floor, that was a drawback.

I did not eat while at the establishment. But there were a lot of people who did. I checked out the prices which seemed VERY inexpensive and also checked out the portions others had which were VERY large. But I can't attest to the quality. Despite negative reviews (and possibly at my own peril) I will try the food in the future however. 

I was happy with my experience. The people were polite and friendly, the service was good and not intrusive, and the karaoke was fun and had a receptive crowd. While not going to be a regular haunt, I'll certainly come back in the future."}
{"text":"Denny's + a local dive bar = The Ole Brass Rail
This place is nasty dog. Only had 1 beer here, but the poor ventilation left me smelling like greasy hash browns.  Was misled by the sign that indicated that this was a sports bar.   It's not, it's a sketchy dive bar in a sketchy area that for some reason specializes in breakfast food.  If you eat anything here, say your prayers before and after you eat."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast...Great for lunch...Great for Happy Hour...Great for late night food...

Great \"Philly Cheese Steak\", Ruben is great, Happy Hour Domestic Beer $1.75 pint.

Music is always great !  Depending on who is there,  its always different...

Just can't wait to go back everyday...

{"text":"Yeah, it's a little dingy, but that's kind of part of the charm. Sort of. Not sure I ever would have taken the time to check it out were it not in my hood, but it is, and man, it is always hoppin'. So my curiosity got the better of me. It's been described as a neighborhood bar in previous reviews, and it definitely has that feel, as though we might have been the only ones there that hadn't been there before. Been there twice now, once for breakfast on a weekday, once for drinks on a Friday night. Service was friendly and efficient both trips.

Breakfast on a weekday:
Ordered the veggie omelette, and it was... ok. It was cheap, and cheap is good. Makes you a little more forgiving.

Drinks on a Friday night:
Cover band called Velvet Tigers played a well rounded rock mix from the sixties through present day. Drinks were cheap, and strong.

Will I be back? Yeah, probably. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to get there, but it's in my hood, like I said, so I don't have to."}
{"text":"I have been to the brass rail several times but today is the last time for me. The baby boomer waitress acted like it was an inconvenience to her that I was there. The owner was called over because I wanted  a substitution.  He said he would fire the waitress who had been serving me the meal I had requested in the past. (Is 1 biscuit with gravy instead of hash browns really that difficult? ). I wasn't asking for anything for free. The previous non-baby boomer waitress gave me a small up charge and I got the food I had requested. Today I was flatly told no. Incredible."}
{"text":"Breakfast on Saturdays, my favorite. Worth the short drive from mid Scottsdale. Eggs Benedict is delish!  The hollandaise, made very well."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good, cheap breakfast and maybe a little hair of the dog then this is the place for you!  Very popular with nurses, etc. getting off shift in the morning but you can usually find a spot at the bar if the tables are full.  It's a little dingy but that's part of the charm of the place.  Watch your step on the way in!"}
{"text":"the only food you need 6a-2a daily. every special is dynamite 

please don't come here. this is where i go."}
{"text":"When I first went here I was very nervous because it looks like a total trashy dive bar. But when I tasted their food I fell in love with this place. Great food and great people who work here :-)"}
{"text":"Very good breakfasts and great service.  The dinner specials are pretty good, although the pork chops were kind of dry last time I was there.  The beer is very cold."}
{"text":"This place has great service..yummy breakfast..and a kick back atmosphere.  I love it here!"}
{"text":"Not sure what is up with this old town favorite. Same greasy food but wow has the atmosphere changed. Not feeling the love here any more . . . come on gentlemen (and I'm sorry, but I must use that term very loosely here). The same lovely staff as well as the newbies sure try to keep the smile up but damn. Really? Is it all just about you brothers???? Excellent service, owners need a wake up call or 3. You don't even take care of your own."}
{"text":"I live in Peoria so the haul down to the bar was quite a distance. However, it was quite worth it on a Wednesday night. I went to hear the Karaoke and was pleasantly surprised to realize that it was indeed quite good! The \"regulars\" came out and sing to their hearts content. Country, Rock, Easy Listening... good stuff!!!
The Wednesday night special was also delicious, as were the fantastic rum and Cokes. The bartender was always ready. Always helpful! I only had two drinks, but, \"Sheesh!\", that did it for me!! I'd love to go back to that place...on a weekend. When I don't have to be at work the next day at 4am. 
BTW, watch out for the floor/handicapped ramp as you enter/exit the building. It'll get ya!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Sunday breakfast with great service and yummy bloodys  and mimosas. Very friendly place and open early! They have a full bar as well."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend yesterday for breakfast. The food was good and the service was excellent. They have lots of televisions so I was able to watch the inauguration and highlights from the playoff games while I enjoyed my food. They have a standard two egg, hash browns, and bacon or sausage for $4 but I went for the $6 option and added pancakes."}
{"text":"Bad service. Been in this place many times. Drive from laveen. I always come in with my Starbucks coffee and order a bloody marry and breakfast. Well today I was asked to leave I asked the lady you really gonna kick me out for bringing in my coffee? I even ordered a drink. She was in a bad mood for some reason I was asked to leave again. Slow hole in wall spot like this should be happy people return to continue to pass their business along. Well today they lost my business from now on. Been coming here for 5yrs. Never had this issue. I get it if I didn't order a drink but the fact is that was the first thing I ordered was a drink and still told I couldn't have my coffee."}
{"text":"This seat yourself places serves traditional bar food with great prices and good service. My chicken sandwich was juicy and flavorful.  Plus they have crinkle fries! They serve breakfast until 2 and even though we didn't try it, it smelled wonderful.  Plenty of tv's, but because of its popularity parking is tight. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First time and would be the last time. Horrible parking and service, staff ignored us as soon as we walked in. From the views, multiple tables waiting for their orders to be taken. A hello or a be right with you would have gone a long way, walked out before even ordering- started my Sunday off all wrong."}
{"text":"Met some friends here one night who frequent the place. It's a great dive bar with good food and a great prices. 

Breakfast is great and good music."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Phx. Nothing like affordable drinks and breakfast. There's nothing special about the meals but they do them right! Perfect hash browns, eggs, pancakes, and bloody mary's. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy. 
   Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice."}
{"text":"I went in for the cheap breakfast for the first time at noon today. I had the $3 plate. It was okay. My toast was perfect & buttery. I was going to have the $4.75 plate with french toast until I learned it came with one slice of toast! That was very disappointing to learn the price jumps a $1.75 and you get only one slice of dipped toast but could get two pancakes, it doesn't make sense. I wonder how big and fluffy the pancakes are, but not enough to risk it and order them. I just don't get it, why they think one slice of french toast is a fair deal. 
Anyhow the eggs and bacon came with that, they were cooked okay. Could have done a more presentable delivery of the meal at home. Have seen a more presentable job done at many other eateries through out the USA at independently owned or chain restaurants. So I'm in no rush to return here for the breakfast, even if it is cheap. Unlike some I won't be abandoning other long standing breakfast joints for this. After all you get what you pay for. And i prefer my breakfast in a sunny and brighter place as well verses a dark drab bar, but to each their own choice."}
{"text":"Please keep in mind that this place is a \"DIVE BAR\" and an excpetional one :) 

Having had the $3.50 breakfast, a dive bar mimosa (Blue Moon beer with orange juice), great quick, friendly service under $10 - - priceless.  It has a ton of old sports flags from all leagues and teams ... very clean (including the bathroom).  This place is kinda outta the way but definitely worth it.  All my friends visiting will experience this place at one point or another (closer to PHX :)"}
{"text":"Divebar..where the drinks are cheap.. its in the Phoenix  ghetto , and you can play darts and bar games. Sounds o.k. ..

Wouldn't seek this place out.. Wouldn't avoid either
Some of my friends have before

nuff said"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, they know how to make breakfast. And it's cheap, too! This is secretly one of the best breakfast joints in the valley. It's no-fuss, straight-up breakfast food. Parking can be a little bit of a nightmare sometimes because the (never busy) neighboring restaurant doesn't share parking... so we've had to park across the street at WalMart on occasion. Additionally, it can get super busy on game day, so if you want a casual breakfast and don't care about football, avoid Sunday mornings during football season."}
{"text":"Good people, fun times, bartender is very personable and I enjoyed the band. Drinks were good too! A great little bar to relax and hang out on a Friday night."}
{"text":"For some reason, probably a reason associated with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation, I can't ever remember the name of this place.  Since I'm unable to, whenever I bug my coworkers to go there I simply make up a new name for it.  For example:

\"hey guys, we should go to old Mcdonalds house of Brass Railroad Tracks.\"

or

\"Hey, lets go to Brass Traintrack Rails at noon.\"

Since most of my coworkers have not been afflicted with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation they know what I'm talking about.

I sought this place out as a lunch time place during work hours since often I crave a simple beer for lunch instead of caloric \"food.\"  Usually my fellow workers and I will end up at the Dirty Drummer, since it's right across the street from our office building.  This was fine for a while until I realized that The Dirty Drummer is actually fucking gross, the atmosphere is depressing and the servers are visually annoying.  Thanks to my obsession with Yelp and alcohol, I was able to find this little gem, a simple and tasty dive bar that is literally four minutes from our office.  

Old Brass Rail is large and not at all intrusive, it's not so local that everyone looks at you when you walk in and it's not so detached that they don't care that you're there.  Plus, they have those high top bar tables that are fun to sit at, especially when they're spread out and you don't have to hear other people's conversations.  They have a million flat screen TV's for when the conversation slows or when you dine with boys who are distracted by lights and moving objects around them.

I've only been there twice, both times we had the same server, both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p.m.  Everyone loves breakfast, and to serve a cheap breakfast at a BAR until 2 p.m. is god damn fucking brilliant.  The server was super nice, sweet and friendly, remembered us, offered suggestions, was not put off by the fact that we are an unlikely group to be at bar in the middle of a weekday.  I can honestly say that both times I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Brass Railroad Tracks experience. 

I didn't order breakfast because I am not a \"breakfast food\" person.  I order lunch, even in the morning.  I ordered the chicken strips and a salad, I've also had the fries.  Everything was what you expect as far as bar food but genuinely not gross, with the added bonus that it was NOT, in fact, The Dirty Drummer.  Also, it's not over priced for what it is, 7 for an app, 7 for a burger, cheap beers, good specials, 4.50 pitchers, such a great find.  Also, 3.50 breakfast AT A BAR- GENIUS.  In addition to the totally acceptable food, pleasant service and good prices, you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out.  I hope to return to Train Tracks of Brass Railroad Bar soon."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here today after reading the reviews on Yelp. It was not good. My food was obviously precooked and reheated. The bacon was tough and the eggs looked like they had been sitting for awhile. The Coke and cottage cheese were the highlights of my meal and the people were nice. I suppose you get what you pay for, but based on the reviews here, I thought the meal would be better than it was."}
{"text":"I came all the way from L.A. & they was closed!! For a a whole week!!! I'm really disappointed. The food is bomb. How's a place like this going to be closed for a week??? You need to open asap!"}
{"text":"Was in this morning for breakfast and the $5 breakfast option didn't disappoint.  The place appeared clean and we only waited for a minute or so before we were waited on by our server. There appeared to be lots of regulars and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and their food/beverages.  It was my first time and will be back.  Hoping to make it our weekend soccer viewing bar as well."}
{"text":"Looks like they raised the price for their cheap breakfast (2 eggs, hash brown, 2 bacon/sausage, and choice of bread) to $5.  Last time we went though the food wasn't so bad.  If it's still hit or miss though, there's really no reason to make a special trip..  Back to anonymity, good luck to you."}
{"text":"Great breakfast for the price!  Everyone seemed to be enjoying their four dollar bloody Marys.  The OK was fresh.  Lots of friendly films, great service.  Will definitely be back a lot!"}
{"text":"A great place for an inexpensive and filling breakfast.   Hillary did a wonderful job of serving us.  She was attentive, filling coffee before it got down to a half cup and cheerfully clearing the table before bringing our bill.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"As long as you know what you're getting, it doesn't get any better.  I was here yesterday and had the $3.50 special- fantastic! Bacon was crisp as ordered, hash browns were crisp, and they say it's a two egg breakfast, but these have to be the biggest 2 eggs I've ever seen.  Today I'm going there with gf to get hot wings and potato skins (it's 6:30 a.m. I know but I've been out all night, and isn't it great to get wings at 6:30 in the morning?!!!), and I've never had the skins so idk if they're good or not but based on everything I've had, it won't suck. The wings are basic Red Hot/butter variety, but as good as Long Wongs.  Service is always excellent, even when the owner is serving."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite breakfast spot. Decent food and good service. Not sure what happened but the service is crap. Seriously bad customer service from the people bussing tables. Don't yell at your customer and don't be an obnoxious smart ass. The food was pretty mediocre as well. Definitely need to find a new favorite breakfast place as we won't be back"}
{"text":"Would've given 4 if had better presentation. Mushrooms are fresh and food comes out pretty quickly. Friendly service. Like that they have a special every day of the week. Will come back and try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"We stop here late nights. Never had the breakfast but I hear it's good.  Surprise carvin jones was playing!!  The place is good don't expect a lot beer is cold food is cooked smells like broken dreams and regret. Free live music on Fridays. The good news it's free. Get the sampler platter"}
{"text":"This was a bit of a nostalgia pit stop for me. From the late nineties till about 2005, I used to come here regularly for the cheap and tasty breakfast deals. During a recent visit to Phoenix, we decided to grab breakfast one more time for old times sake!

Memory has been kind to OBR! It's a bar that definitely has that divey vibe to it. They do serve some great greasy breakfast foods, though!....and for pretty damn cheap!

The three of us each ordered a breakfast combo, each ran from $4.00 to $6.00 each! How can you beat that?!

Service was a little slow but okay. The service can be spotty at times and this was going to be an easy 4 star review up until 5 minutes before we left. We asked our waitress for our bill. Now I remember if they were busy and the waitress couldn't get back to settle the tab, you could just go up to the bar and pay. It wasn't very busy at all and we waited a few minutes, but were ready to leave ...so I approached the bar. I was anxious to pay because we were all so happy to be there we had a 75% tip for her as well! I very much enjoy tipping people, especially if they give me reason to tip generously. 

There was a nice guy(who I think was a busser(??)with glasses) who tried to get her attention, but she pretty much ignored him. He looked back at me and said \"I tried\". Nice. I waved at her to try to get her attention, she looked directly at me, looked through me, and than turned her back to me and started chatting with a co-worker. That was pretty rude and annoying. So, unbeknownst to her, I put some of that tip back in my pocket! I still tipped 50%, but that left a sour taste in my mouth.

So i left the cash and headed out the door, and once she saw the tip, she became pretty enthusiastic and friendly. Whatever.

The food is good, cheap, and greasy. ...and I say that in a flattering light....but keep expectations for service at a lower level and you may not leave disappointed...

I will always have good memories here...but realistically its..

3 stars."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times since I live in the area, but never had a reason to drop in. Thank goodness for co-workers! Peter (who was featured in my Burger Theory review photo) asked if I could pick him up after he dropped off his car at a nearby mechanic. Then he mentioned breakfast. I didn't know you could get breakfast at a sports bar!

Ole Brass Rail is a typical sports bar with lots of televisions. It's an older building and it looks it's age in terms of decor. But it's clean and the service is friendly. And the breakfast is pretty solid for $5. Their #1 combo includes two eggs, hash browns, toast and bacon or sausage. Everything was nice and hot and came out quickly. Hard to beat for the money!

Then later that day, when it was time to pick up the vehicle, we ended up back at Ole Brass Rail because his car wasn't ready. Beer time!

While the wait for the car was only 20 mins, it was better spent at the bar vs. the mechanics shop. Unfortunately, the mechanics shop might have a better selection of beers than Ole Brass Rail. I am an admitted beer snob and love the variety of craft beers out there. Ole Brass Rail's selection doesn't feature anything local, but what they do offer has some variety and solid choices (ie. Heineken & Modelo). The beer selection is the primary reason I didn't give it four stars.

While Ole Brass Rail isn't exactly my cup of tea, I wouldn't rule it out for a return visit. What they do, they do well. And judging from the packed parking lot at each visit, they are doing it well for a lot of happy people."}
{"text":"I love this place. Foods always great bartenders are so nice. Bloody Mary's are amazing ! I always stick to the biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"The working man's breakfast hole that has been feeding locals cheaply  since long before many of us could identify Phoenix on the map.  If I was ever a location scout and needed a seedy local dive bar from which my main characters could procure a map from an unkempt local in order to launch their adventure i would start here."}
{"text":"This place is great!  If I want breakfast (served until 2pm!) it's hard to come up with something that sounds better than the Brass Rail.  It's cheap and it's straight forward, delicious breakfast!  I've had the eggs/bacon/hashbrowns/toast meal, which is hard to beat, and the pancakes, which I scarfed down without giving a second look a the appetizer that I had ordered (which was also very good).  What more could you want than delicious, traditional breakfast, very low prices, and friendly service?  Try it!"}
{"text":"Love this joint. Best breakfast for the buck. BnB Breakfast aNd Beer. Love the staff. Yay tacos."}
{"text":"Came in while my car was getting fixed next door, bartender was cool and the place had chill vibes. The hot wings were bomb and that's a make or break for me. Cheap prices compared to most of Arcadia, I'll be back. Cool dive bar"}
{"text":"We didn't come here for the food.   Happy hour drink specials are as advertised.   AWESOME!    

Service is friendly, beers are cold and the fried jalapeño poppers are only $3 buckers!    Classic dive bar with 20 plus flat screens and every game imaginable on.  

This place is a party waiting to happen.  (We happened to show up to a birthday party (they were 13). Haha, kinda awkward.  

All in all I'd come back.  Check it out.  If you hate it I'll pay for your jalapeño poppers."}
{"text":"Great truck stop kinda breakfast at right price. I've tried just about everything on breakfast menu and have never left disappointed"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Breakfast is great too. Sometimes the service is lackluster, but overall ok."}
{"text":"Shhh don't tell anyone but I have been coming in here since high school (cut class and 
snuck in) when Mickey still ran the place.  Mickey passed away some years ago but his son Danny stepped up to the plate and is now \"The Boss\".  This is a local neighborhood bar, plain and simple although some would call it a sports bar since they don't play anything else but sports on the TV;s,  Dewey works there as a waiter, and he has been there for twenty something years.  So has another waitress but she only works part time.  There are a couple of different bartenders but the main one is Chad who has a fantastic personality and makes everyone feel really welcome.  Everyone who works there is great and always remembers your name and what you drink and or eat.  Really inexpensive but filling breakfasts.  A special for lunch everyday.  The food isn't like eating at a five star resort, but for the price it is pretty good ! Taco Tuesdays and Saturdays tacos are a buck until 7pm.  Live bands on Fridays and Karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday.  Kind of a tradition to have Sunday breakfasts here so tends to be a little busy.  They used to have a pool table and took it out but left in the darts and there are some electronic machines on the bars to play games, and there is a modern day juke box, and a great patio for smoking.  Hey you can't ask for a whole lot more.  A comfortable bar to relax and just chill."}
{"text":"Ok...so last night we only needed a few things to make the evening successful...

1) Televisions showing the first (official) football game of the season (Giants vs. the icky Cowboys...hey, it's MY review and I can call them whatever I want!)
2) Full bar...or in lieu of a full bar, at least a working fridge with jack, coke, jager and bud light...(oh yeah, we're high falootin' aren't we?)
3) Enough wherewithal to pretend that something is on 'happy hour special'...we're ok if the place just makes something up...

And for fulfilling our needs rather well, and our wonderful server Holly, I am delivering 3 stars...yes, the jager was a little pricey (I believe it was $5/itty bitty shot), but since that wasn't part of the 3 commandments, I'm not gonna ding this place for points...

Hubby went with the patty melt and spicy fries, I decided to go for the gold and ordered a bacon mushroom cheeseburger (also with spicy fries)...the fries were yummy, I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms on the burger, but the bun, burger, cheese and bacon were delightful...or maybe that was the jack & coke talking...if so, it doesn't matter, when my belly and brain are happy, EVERYONE is happy. 

Towards the end of our excursion, they rolled in the karaoke, so it started getting a little louder and we decided to take our party elsewhere, but after visiting 3 other totally packed sports bars, we're happy we were able to find this little neighborhood gem.  

Good prices, decent food, not jam-packed with tools. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Fun looking place. Horrible experience. Came for st paddy's. Old waitress made sure to ignore us as we stood by the bar until it was too obvious she was ignoring us. She gave us our beers and closed me out without offering to keep it open.(I planned on staying longer). While enjoying our beers outside patio we steered clear away from the smokers to enjoy outside. One regular made sure to come all the way to stand next to our table and smoke. Obviously if ur not a regular you not welcome here."}
{"text":"This place has great food for the price.  It far exceeds any bar expectations!  I also have to say the live music on Friday nights = Incredible time!  The band Spotlight performed some high energy disco, funk, rock, and a little country to wet your whistle!  The drinks, staff and music trio makes this a place to visit any time of day. If you are in the area, I suggest you stop by and see what the hype is all about.  Oh, and you will be delightfully surprised at the bar tab for sure!"}
{"text":"Here's what I know...

I went for a happy hour, and got a pint of beer, wings and mozzarella sticks for $12. 

No pretentious people allowed here, so it had that going for it. It's almost a dive bar, almost a sports bar, but definitely a great spot to meet a friend or 12 for happy hour and to catch up without a huge crowd or crappy bartenders. 

I love places like Brass Rail and wish I had one right down the street from my house."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby upscale resort and my date took me to OBR for Sunday morning breakfast. When he told me about the $3 breakfast, I thought to myself, \"Geez, is this guy cheap or what? No champagne brunch?\" But, he was right! The #1 was really good, certainly not something you'd expect from a place that is essentially a bar. It was certainly heads and tails above Denny's. He had the one w/ biscuits and gravy - rich and heart-stoppingly delicious (I had a bite). And, the service was friendly and efficient. 

While the atmosphere is dingy and tired (but clean) as reported by other reviewers, it seems to all work together, including the interesting mix of patrons and wait staff. Even the just two choices of jam (concord grape or strawberry) seemed fitting. We were there before 10 am when alcohol could be served, so I think I missed the full OBR experience. I guess I'll just have to go back... It was one of the highlights of our visit to Phoenix, for sure!"}
{"text":"If you like too drink but don't want a big bar tab this is the place to be. My boyfriend and I love to drink heavily when we go out and I was amazed at the bar tab when we left. I believe we drank about $75 worth of liquor and paid $30. The band on Fridays was good blues band and well worth the entertainment. 

We went back on Sunday to try there breakfast...I was amazed at the food you get for such a low price. A breakfast for two $13 including coffee and OJ. Our waitress Angie was delightful and very nice. I am a picky eater and cookie cutter places like Ihop and Denny's don't impress me with there over priced stale foods and horrible service. 

This place gets 2 thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"I go on weekends for breakfast. It's cheap and staff is friendly and it's always good."}
{"text":"Don't go here the owner is by far the biggest jerk !!!! He discriminates against everyone trust me when I say this don't go here"}
{"text":"First off let me tell you that my husband and I have been making this a regular stop about 8-10 times a month. When we have to go to a couple stores and we we stop there first to have a meal because it is across the street.  One I had worked till 3:30am and had not woken till about 10:30 am and When my husband said we had to go to a couple stores I suggested a stop for something to eat at what had been one of my favorite places. Good food, mostly nice service friendly atmosphere and seemingly clean. My husband always orders for me so he asked what I wanted. I told him I would like coffee with my food because I was cold  then I might have something after eating. I ate my taco's my husband ate his breakfast.  When the second person came around he asked if he could get us anything else. I asked for a rum and coke. he said something to the effect of he wasn't serving anymore drinks that day. We actually thought he was joking then he brought us the bill. I asked him again for a drink and he said I looked drunk. Tired maybe but hadn't had anything to drink that day. I paid my check and told him that we would not be back. He said, \" who cares\". He heard my husband order coffee from the other barmaid with my meal. My husband always orders for me. Point is that although they stay busy most times they just lost over $200+ a month because of his behavior. Maybe they should think to ask the person they took over for what the story was. Did my shopping and now I will go spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"The $5 breakfast at this place is fantastic! Eggs (however you want them), hash browns, bacon or sausage, and toast or English muffin.

I run with a group on Saturday mornings who ALWAYS come here afterwards. It's divey & surprisingly (at least to me) crowded in the mornings. The parking lot was completely full when I came & from what I understand it's always like that. 

Our server was very nice & quick (she knew the members of the running group who come here regularly). I also appreciate that they keep a basket of condiments (ketchup, hot sauce, jam, etc...) at your table so everything is ready to go when your order comes. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I like the OBR. Great breakfast that wont set you back. The restrooms are clean, and the wait staff are always attentive. I have only visited during breakfast hours, so I don't know about the bar experience."}
{"text":"Not just a nice, diverse neighborhood sports bar (25+ TVs). Live band Fri. & karaoke Wed. & Sat. Great staff & great food. No rip- off portions here!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place. You get a lot at a low price. Been going for years now. Service is great, food is always good and out quick. Parking is a pain at times."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I was drinking heavily (which is NOT a usual occurance!) but I really liked this little hole in the wall!  The server was fantastic!  She kept our glasses filled at just the right times (which was way too many!)  I don't think most people tip well here because she was shocked with a good cash tip. (So when you go...be nice and tip well!)   The bathroom was clean, the music was great!  The band was ReGroove, and it was just a fun night!  The clientele was interesting ;o) Drinks were pretty strong and cheap!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Tina was our server, she did a great job!

Came here for breakfast, on the recommendation of a great friend.

Had the #2 breakfast special, 2 eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit with gravy.

The biscuit and gravy were tasty, though likely premade gravy, and frozen biscuit. Not a complaint, just an observation.

The price of three meals was extremely reasonable.

I would recommend this place for breakfast.

I also hope to check the place out in the evening."}
{"text":"so i decided to take a friend to try this place out for breakfast...i love eating at little mom and pop kind of places, they always have the best food.  well we get in, have a seat and wait for anyone to even acknowledge us for 10 min...then we get drinks finally. she then takes our orders and our waitress had absolutley no personality and we saw her a total of 2 times we were there (someone else was filling our drinks and brought our food, she was a nice lady actually i wish we would of had her) Then i get the food, the pankcakes were horrible and rubbery and tasted straight out of a bisquik box, and the biscuits and gravy were absolutely disgusting (plus they make there gravy with hamburger meat...ewww) so def no my first choice and i actually wish we would have gone to denny's like we planned (at least we would have gotten good service and good food). The only thing i liked were there prices....but i guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This sports bar and grill is the beat in the area. All of the bartenders, wait staff, kitchen and everyone else I am forgetting to mention are fantastic!!! I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Down-home live music dive that's family owned and offers a great value for the money. Cheap drinks, good food, no cover (usually). Opens at 6 am most days. Get over here."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's close to home and the staff here is pretty cool. Great specials on drinks and I have been impressed with their food. I either order chicken fingers with honey mustard because it's kinda spicy or the rueben and neither let me down. 

I feel like I'm in Cheers- same people here everytime I come and the vibe is very chill.  I want to recommend this place, but I feel like it is a secret spot so don't tell your friends ;)  if you are in the area looking for a drink then definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Popped in here awhile back, watched a decent local band do classic rock for about :30 min. It was pretty empty for a Friday night (the place is deceptively bigger than it looks from outside). Mostly older, rougher crowd, they mostly felt like neighborhood regulars. 

Drinks were cheap (why they get three stars).

Kinda dingy atmosphere in here, felt old and tired. With a face lift and some hope, perhaps the OBR can rise again... you let me know...."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast for cheap. Small mom and pop ambience. It's been around since... the sixties? Took Anna M and met up with my Grandma there for brunch. She started talking about back in the day they used to also hang out here and bowl at the Wagon Wheel bowling alley. Older employee chimes in and says, \"When they tore down the Wagon Wheel, we used several of there lanes for our bar counter\". 
The food may not be special, but it doesn't suck. The biscuits and gravy are good, the drinks are cheap and the old Phoenix atmosphere is free.  You got to try once to say you've gone there."}
{"text":"7-13-2015 Monday

Just had their chili cheese fries(pictured), very good and very large, it's over 7$ but they give u alot, it's 2 meals in itself.  I have tried many foods here: cheeseburger, hotdogs, wings, chili, nachos, mexican pizza, biscuits&gravy, porkchops and it's all very good. The place has a good vibe. The staff and patrons are friendly.  The only thing is the service can be slow and I've experienced the karaoke host skipping people(I've paid attention) but if you want great food at somewhat reasonable prices, brass rail is your place."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast at the Ole Brass Rail. Still has a sports bar vibe even in the morning, with ESPN channels broadcasting from every angle. Happily, the breakfast offerings are much higher quality than you might expect at a bar. 

Don't be discouraged if the front parking lot is full. There's more parking around the side and back. The interior is larger than what you might think just viewing it from the street. Walk on in and find yourself a table or belly up to the bar.

Friendly servers. Kudos for actually serving bacon crispy when requested. Meals are for the most part a great value. A diverse clientele ranging from retired couples, business owners planning their day, workers on a break, women socializing... and they have table arrangements that can easily handle larger groups. Actually kind of noisy this morning and the coffee refills and check delivery could have been a little more timely. Not a big deal, however, with so many sporting options to view while waiting.

Watch yourself on the way out the front door. The floor is a bit uneven, which could be a problem if you have been emphasizing the \"bar\" over the \"grill\". The Ole Brass Rail's décor could be termed sports bar basic, but it matters not. It's a great neighborhood bar and grill that has found a way to succeed even in the morning breakfast hours."}
{"text":"Great lunch at OBR, came back for the massive nachos with chicken!  Our server was sweet and took great care of us.  My friend had the club sandwich that did not disappoint.  Awesome lunch gem!"}
{"text":"The Ole Brass Rail is a staple dive bar in my hood.  I've only been privy to it in the morning/early afternoon and can to speak to its charm then.

A neighbor introduced me to it as \"that place you go\" when you want eggs on the cheap. 

Why? They're yummy and they're cheap. And they're good! There are three basic breakfast options (no substitutions). $4 will buy you eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon and toast. Can't go wrong there!  $6 is the same w/French Toast, Pancakes or a Biscuit. I've never tried anything else off the regular menu, however they do offer omelettes and regular lunch and dinner options. 

There's never any parking. (Seriously). This gritty place offers ample television viewing options to catch a game. (Twenty one of them!) The downside is there doesn't appear to be any sound offered. Wifi if you want it. 

A pitcher of beer is five bucks. Apparently this is a really good place to get tanked on the cheap. Or to recover from a hangover. There is a full bar with ample seating.

The service is very laid back. And by that I mean you may need to wait. And wait. Be very ready to place your order. The servers have worked here forever and are super, duper nice. They have tons of tables to cover. They're a-ok with you getting up to re-fill your own coffee. (Take that as you will as a measure of service. But for the Denny's rock bottom pricing there's not much to complain over.)

This is a very local, casual, older, place. This is not a fancy place. This is not \"let's go here after church\" place. I don't even know if there's a dress code. There's charm and character tho. If you're in this neck of the woods and hangry check it out!"}
{"text":"We came for karaoke and none of us had been here. Honestly we were a little worried coming in, but with a group of friends it made it easier. It's a place that people can just have fun and sing and not have to be in total performance mode--just com and enjoy singing. Had the French dip and it was reliable. Drinks were fine and plentiful. Service was nice and fast. Had a good time."}
{"text":"It was as quiet as a tomb-unless you count the drunk talking to himself. The bartender started to play the theme to the titanic. I RAN out the door (overtipping shamelessly in my haste) when he played \"Send in the clowns.\"
Seriously. Not funny. No bueno.

HOWEVER,
The wings were awesome, the jalapeno poppers were yummy, and I've been back since.

I went for lunch.  I had exactly the same thing with a small pitcher.  Happy happy!
The bartender this time was great.

I like it and I want to be there now...

Update:  10-11-2011

The breakfasts are incredible!  the wings are still tasty.
However, the jalapeno poppers are not as good as before and the iced tea is SUPER weak.  So, up to 4 stars from 3, but not yet good enough for 5."}
{"text":"I remember driving by this bar a couple of years ago and laughing out loud because the parking lot was packed at 8am.  I was asking myself, who the HELL *are* these people, getting loaded this early?!

Fast forward two years later, and I've become one of \"those people\"  Well, with the caveat that I'm not getting loaded.

Now I figger that my excuse is about as good as they come.  I'm working nights from 6pm to 6am, and after putting in a 12 hour shift, sometimes a man wants to have a damn drink, get something to eat, read the newspaper, relax a bit.  This avoids the unwelcome alternative of \"unwinding\" by drinking at home alone at 7am,  which tends to generate feelings of being a total loser.

So anyway, ye Old Brass Rail opens bright and early at 6am, which is perfect.  As with any bar opening at this hour, there is your contingent of old man alkeeholic regulars, but this particular place also seems to be popular with the nurses getting off the night shift at a nearby hospital.  They usually enter in groups of 2-4, ordering double long island ice teas, and getting their drink on in their scrubs.  Some of them are even cute.

The service is attentive and low-key.  Drinks are cheap and there are several breakfast specials available for under $5.   The food is nothing amazing but it gets the job done and the price is definitely right.   The first time I walked out of there after paying $7 for breakfast with a tall  gin and grapefruit juice, I knew that I had found a winner.

There is a smoking patio with misters, but much to my dismay I got bawled out one day for taking a plate of pancakes out there. APPARENTLY, there is no food served on the patio, nor is the consumption of food that you have brought out to the patio yourself tolerated.  The reason given was pretty lame too, it basically boiled down to the fact that they didn't want to deal with people bitching about smoke ruining their breakfast, or something, blah blah blah.   So far, that has been my only negative experience at this place.

The joint could use face lift, like another reviewer mentioned, but doing so might erase some of its character.

Just watch your step on the way out the door, there's a slight incline that's easy to get tripped up on. :-O  Regulars will back me up on this."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for breakfast. 
It's cheap and yummy. You can get hashbrowns, eggs, biscuits & gravy and bacon all for $5.50 and its a large portion. I also love that they cook their Bacon properly and its not fatty or gross and limp.
Not only is the breakfast awesome, but the drinks are strong and the service is always friendly and on point."}
{"text":"Still good service friendly staff good variety in menu choices.... Had full slab rib dinner for 16 corn toast beans Cole slaw and full rack... You can tell the sauce is chef recipe and not just bottle. Tastes like a Kansas vinegar based bbq mop sauce. Nice and tender. I would get it again . Still seems like Lotta regulars plenty of tvs snf game on with sound. Most everyone sits at the bar. Handful of tables could probably seat 50-75 total on avg 10-20 people"}
