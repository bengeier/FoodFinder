{"text":"As good as any New York deli.  Beats  all of the local deli' by far. If you are looking for a great place to eat, great service try Abe's"}
{"text":"Abe's is closed. Drove across town only to discover construction crews tearing out all the equipment."}
{"text":"Stopped at Abe's before getting on board a long flight home.  Figured anything we would bring aboard would be better than anything we could get on the plane.  We're we right!!!  My wife had turkey pastrami on rye.  I had tongue and turkey on rye which I hadn't had in years.  Both sandwiches were wonderful.    We had the sides, Russian dressing, etc, all double wrapped in plastic and aluminum foil.  I knew it was going to be good when I commented how nice the smoked fish looked.  The owner told me he gets it from Acme in Brooklyn?. That's why it looked so good.  Acme is the best. I'd sure go back if I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Tons of meat piled high on the sandwiches....but honestly, for $12.50 you had better hook me up.  I also dislike when deli style places charge $1 extra for cheese, I mean seriously - give me a break here.  So yes, the food is good quality, yes, the portions are big - but for $13.50 a pop, I'd better be getting a lot of pastrami.  I think I'll stick to boars head and fresh rye from the grocery and save the going out for dishes that take a little more skill to prepare.   Great service and nicely decorated place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place less than 1 star. The bagels are inedible and the service is even worse if that is possible. 45 minute wait for breakfast.  I have given them several chances to improve.  This was my last!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! I've eaten here three times in the last two weeks. I am used to the Chicago deli experience and while I love Goldmann's food- it doesn't have the ambiance of Abe's. I am not understanding the hate from some of the folks posting here since I've found the service to be excellent and the food pretty good. This is the only place in town that does justice to a hot brisket sandwich! Their grilled challah under it is wonderful. Their turkey is much better than anything Chompies piles on a plate. I am so happy to see a great neighborhood deli open in this town- where you can sit down and have a nosh or a meal."}
{"text":"Tried it over the weekend, as I usually go to another 'very-near-by' bagel and bialy place, just to see the competition, you can tell they are trying to poach customers from this other near-by deli.  Had a bagel and lox, to start, as it's pretty much a standard for a 'jewish' bakery. The nova was really bad, very slimy and smelled 'too' fishy for lox. Cream cheese was fine, tomatoes looked maybe a day or two old. And my bagel was undercooked on the inside. I picked at it but was not happy.  For my main dish I got the Rueben, which was pretty good. Nothing bad to note, but not the best I've had.  My wife got an omelet which was very over cooked... brown 'crunchy' eggs, rubbery texture. Just no good. After notifying the waitress, we felt like we were being judged and her attitude was on the cusp of rude, saying, \"Well do you want me to get you a new one or not?\" normally not a rude sentence, but with her attitude you could tell this wasn't the first plate sent back this morning.  Really sad this place was a dud, as the prices looked pretty good for the neighborhood.  Abe's website says, \"Finally an alternative\" I disagree... There is a reason other places have been around for 20+ years. I'm going to stick to my normal bagel and bialy place right across the street.   tl;dr Don't chance it and Skip Abe's."}
{"text":"Finally, an alternative! Way to go Larry. Great food and atmosphere. The best Reuben sandwich that I've had in Scottsdale/Phoenix. I think it's important to remember that they had not even had their \"grand opening\" or advertised. Everyone that is here knows about it by word of mouth. That should tell you something about the food...  I returned and ate breakfast over the weekend. Great breakfast - we had the Holy Toledo which was French Toast, Eggs, Bacon and a bagel."}
{"text":"Great Place.  I eat there every chance I get since I found it.  We have needed a Deli like this!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today, ordered a pastrami on rye, sandwich came and was very fat and salty and the meat seemed like it was sitting in a Luke warm steamer for hours. I wouldn't recommend their meat thought it was awful not worth any price. My wife and I are visiting Scottsdale and have eaten at a bunch of Jewish style delis and this was the first one that was not worth returning to.p"}
{"text":"Nice decor, good bagel, terrible service. 50 minutes to get 2 toasted bagels and a check."}
{"text":"this is our senond time (last one). the quality of the food is just fair; service not much better. anyone who has been to a good deli and comes here only to be disappointed. you better go soon, if you dare, because this place does not belong in scottsdale and is not low to be around. secondary location with secondary food - sorry, but these are facts.  marty"}
{"text":"We go to Abe's on a weekly basis for breakfast.  We are greeted and seated promptly in their stylish, comfortable and extremely clean dining room.  While many things on the menu are good, we are particular fans of the wonderfully priced breakfast sandwiches - eggs, meat, cheese, or lox combos you can order many ways on all different kinds of bread.  My husband is consistent with his generously portioned nova lox on a bagel, while I get my eggs scrambled with muenster cheese on rye bread.  All are served with a side of fruit.  A great meal for a reasonable price.  The challah french toast, blintzes and apple strudel all are good choices as well. We will continue to visit Abe's on a regularly - it's a favorite!"}
{"text":"Best Deli in Phoenix. Larry the owner chatted with us like we were old friends while his son manned the deli.   We ordered lox and Larry, like a sushi master, sliced them himself. My mom hadn't seen done in years. Roast beef sliced really thin and delish. Apple strudel was excellent. This was after a delicious skirk steak, slaw and mashers. Very clean.  A real family owned and operated restaurant. They have schmaltz! Brought up family memories from my mom fighting over gribenes, a by product of rendered chicken fat, when she was a little girl. Deli meats made in house. Artisanal style. This is the real deal and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Decided to try Abe's for breakfast. After reading all of the wonderful Yelp reviews I figured how could we go wrong!? Well, I don't know what everyone else ate, but we went very wrong.   I ordered the nova, eggs, and onion for breakfast as did my dad. We get this all the time everywhere we go and never have I had \"fishy\" lox. It smelled so bad I was afraid to try it and when I did I realized that it tasted just as bad. I could not finished it and exchanged it for egg whites made without butter and bacon. The egg whites came soaked in butter with bacon that had a weird \"irony\" taste. My dad felt the same way about his food.   After all of this the waitress felt bad and brought a brownie for me to take home, but honestly after I ordered egg whites I couldn't eat due to being smothered in butter, the last thing I wanted was a brownie...  I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, especially when Butterfields is down the street."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the restaurant, placing my passover order, the day that previous reviewer \"Carol L\" was there. She was rude, impatient, and seemed to be looking for a problem. I have found Larry Abel to be professional, warm, helpful and generous. The food is delicious and everything a jewish deli should be and more! Larry and his staff filled our large passover order, checking and double checking to be sure we had everything we needed. We also ate in the restaurant the day we picked up the order and the food was delicious. The wait staff was equally charming and gracious. We will be back over and over again! Some people seem to just be looking for a problem. Life is too short to be so grumpy!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Brooklyn and the one thing I'm missing in Scottsdale is a good Kosher-style deli.  Abe's met that need, and met my expectations!  We each ordered a \"junior\" sandwich which is 6 oz of meat in a sandwich half.  I had the pastrami on rye and my daughter ordered the corned beef on challah.  They were both exactly how I expected them and how I remembered these sandwiches from growing up.  My only \"issue\" (not serious at all) is that I wish the menu mentioned that the \"junior\" is a half-sandwich.  We just expected each to be a full sandwich with \"only\" 6 oz of meat in total, and planned on sharing each half-sandwich.  It was a lot more difficult to cut the half sandwich in half.    We were served sour and half-sour pickles when we sat down, and since I have a very difficult time finding anything but dill pickles in Scottsdale, we finished the pickles before we even ordered our sandwiches - no worries - our waiter quickly brought over more pickles.  Now I'm going to have to go back with my husband!"}
{"text":"3 Strikes and YOU ARE OUT!  First time my Kishka was burned  Second time they made my Matzo Brie with Peppers even after I told the waiter 2 times NO PEPPERS  Third time they made my sandwich with Corned Beef when I ordered Turkey.  Wait staff has the personality of a Pet Rock"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I'm there the food is delicious, it comes out fast and people are friendly. The owner, Larry, always comes by to say hi and makes sure everything is great. I love that it's super clean too, I haven't had that experience with other deli's in the valley. I'm addicted to the corned beef but my fiance says the pastrami is amazing."}
{"text":"I hoped, that Abe's would at least attempt to emulate a N.Y. Deli. dream smashed. Not even close. What a disappointment. Their isn't time to go into details, but even Chompies does a better job, albeit their establishment is bit seedy.  Abe, get your act together, and try to get it right. We need a real deli in Scottsdale. Your establishment is clean and wholesome but your product?"}
{"text":"Went to Abes this last Sat am with some friends to try it out. Was really impressed! The owner (Larry) greeted us at the door and made us feel like family. Breakfast was really good, the potatoes and eggs spot on!  The breakfast was so good, we came back for lunch on Sunday. Even better, they now have tables outside on the patio. Service was really good."}
{"text":"We went there since it is near my new favorite deli NYBB and wont go back. Not many people in the place but it took 45 minutes for eggs and one of us got the wrong order. The female manager barely apologized and did not offer to do anything about it and since it was soooo late - they got nothing...The bagels were horrible."}
{"text":"In all fairness to Abe's, life is tough when you're up against valley Icon Chompies.  That being said, why would someone choose Abe's over Chompies?  Well, right now, its to give this place a chance at potential.  If you're tired of Chompies New York subway feel, Abe's is a nice alternative.  It's quieter and slower and I do mean slower. The wait person who waited on us made us wait on him and no one should call a stranger 'darling' in Phoenix.  This 'ain't' the south.    The food was good and a bit overpriced.  The seasoned fries were so red with paprika I had to scrap it off with a knife.  The hot dogs were delicious as was the 'Cloak and Dagger' sandwich.  There was nice choice of a 'junior' sized sandwich which was much easier to enjoy than Chompies miles of cardiac arrest.   We decided to go for dessert and had quite a long wait.  The food was delicious, but I would have enjoyed it more had \"darling' not taken over 15 minutes to serve it.  Also, 'darling' offered to have chocolate sauce draped over the the chocolate cake as an addition.  I believe this is part of the plating process.   \"Darling\" and the others needs more training and I'm sure once this place finds its groove, it will be a great addition to the Shea 4-square area."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago I had a gathering at my house of 25 people and I had it catered by Abe's.  The trays were magnificent.......I don't agree with another post that I read here about the deli trays.  In my experience, the meat was fresh and plentiful.....we had leftovers for days. Larry, the owner of Abe's hand delivered the trays to my home and I was thrilled with the food and service.  I also have to say that I have not tasted Rye bread or Bagels as good as Abe's since I lived in NYC more than 16 years ago.  I have been a frequent patron since they opened at the end of last year and I have never been disappointed.  The food is delicious, the service fantastic and I will continue to enjoy this restaurant and would not hesitate for a second to have them cater my next party."}
{"text":"Everyone at work had lunch from here and we were all pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the food. a little expensive for everyday and they didn't have a delivery driver but pick up was quick and easy. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"I sent two colleagues to Abe's after our fantastic meal there. They are now fans too. They raved about the pastrami/turkey, the pickles, and no wait for seating during weekday lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We had the Reuben on the latke. BEST SANDWICH EVER. Do yourself a favor and eat it! Try the pickles and salads too. Service was great."}
{"text":"Finally a real NY deli in Scottsdale...  The food is awesome and the inside is neat, clean and very inviting!  I had the corned beef and pastrami sandwich; the real deal!  The pickles, Don Herman's, were outstanding. The turkey is the real deal too.  Fresh roasted and sliced to perfection.  The Challah is the bomb and the bagels are from Brooklyn.  Everyone knows that the bagels in Brooklyn are PHAT!!!  Jake, our server was very friendly and helpful.  Make sure to ask for him!  This is a must try and I know that you will be hooked!!!!!  Eat up and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The hands-down best bagels in the valley! Go see Larry and he'll make one hot and fresh for you.  My new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"I work at a job that has me travel to Scottsdale several times per year, and mostly, I end up eating at either the hotel or a popular restaurant.   With that in mind, I was surprised to find a large collection of delis.   Abe's was recommended by an online blog as a great spot for Mother's Day. So, I called, found out they were sold out, but explained that I was from out of town and needed some help. I was talking to Larry himself and he said he would make it happen.  We arrived and the staff was great! The display case had many home made smoked and cured meats. It looked wonderful!  My wife ordered a lox plate, and I ordered a hollandaise salmon Benedict.  My wife's meal was great! It came with latke's and chocolate covered strawberries. The bagel was perfectly chewy and dense. The cream cheese was wonderfully light. Overall, a great plate!  My Benedict was to die for. The sauce was wonderful and perfectly seasoned. The salmon was smoked perfectly and salted wonderfully well. I loved it!  The only improvement I can think of would be to control the fruit quality. The blueberries were wilted, and overall the fruit was bland.  Finally, today I received a call from Abe's asking me about my experience! I was shocked, they called to ensure things went well!   I'm going to be a regular and would recommend Abe's to those who want a great meal!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  They are still new and it is evident that they are still figuring a few things out but overall the quality of food has been good!  I've had a few burgers, french toast and a wrap. I wish they would do something with the patio.  It is such an eye sore and waste of space."}
{"text":"Just completed the corned beef sandwich. Now, after trying all the big three meats (CB, Pastrami and Brisket), it is true that they know what they are doing here at Abe's. The corned Beef was clearly NY style, not deli-sliced, and was a perfect fit on the rye bread. The 6oz sandwich is pretty tall too and will clearly fill you up. Also sampled the steak fries and they put some paprika on top, but these needed a few more minutes in the oven to get them crispy. Bagels are still top-notch, no reason to go to any other Jewish deli at this point."}
{"text":"Went with some folks who eat at Abe's often-and they were happy with their selections. The blintzes were good. Do not order the soup-it was thin, flavorless, and almost inedible. Matzoh balls were as bland as anything. It's a nice place-but need to improve their food."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday around 5pm. Had quite a few customers for that time of day. Had the best Cobb Salad I've ever had in my life. Let's see if I can list/remember everything it had in it: bacon (crispy like I have to have it), turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, mushrooms, radishes, carrots, cucumbers, red bell pepper, egg, and celery maybe? (I had them hold the red onions.) An entire garden. All diced up in pieces so you needn't use your knife. Just pick up your fork and move in. Large bowl /big serving. 10 minutes later - looks like I hadn't even started. 20 minutes of little conversation, mostly feeding my face, I give up. Can't finish it all. And I went in starving. I need to admit though I had a bagel too. It was crunchy on outside and VERY chewy. I think that's how they like them back east.   They make them in New York, flash freeze them, send them to this restaurant and they bake them up fresh each day. The waitress said the NY water they make them in makes all the difference.  I have to say, IMO, Chompies are better. But I'm a Kansas-Arizona girl, so what do I know. All I can say is, they were chewy. Like bite down and pull/tug to get a bite size piece and then chew for about two minutes before swallowing.  Must be the water.   The waitress was amazing. Apparently, they have two kinds of coleslaw. A vinegar-y one and a regular one. My fiancée likes the non-vinegar kind, but doesn't like it wet and runny he tells her. She states that she can dry it off for him. She was true to her word and he loved his corned beef sandwich (looked as big as the picture on the website) and his \"dry\" coleslaw.   We had a Living Social coupon - great deal for a great meal. I bought two more coupons. We WILL be back!  We also like the fact that they serve breakfast all day, as we sometimes get out a little late for breakfast fare at most restaurants. We drive from North Phoenix, so you know we like this place."}
{"text":"The best Jewish Delli in the northeast Vally. The Cloak &. Dagger gets it today!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good.  The first time we went there, right after the opening, it really was.  But our second trip was a total disappointment.  They served us stale bagels, the whitefish was totally bony and the food in general was mediocre.  If they want to compete with Chompie's and NY's Best, they need to do a quick re-boot or they will become part of Scottsdale restaurant history."}
{"text":"I only wish that I could have the whole menu in one sitting! What a great place, super nice, friendly and fast service, accommodate special requests quickly and with a smile and the god was fantastic. After a great Reuben, I splurged some calories on a cheesecake and - wow, probably the best cheesecake I ever had! Definitely will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! By far the best deli in the Phoenix area...this being said by one who grew up with the best Jewish delis in New York. The rye bread alone is worth the trip, as is the corned beef and the really rare roast beef. Great smoked fish, too: nova, lox, whitefish, sable and sturgeon...the real stuff! Excellent cole slaw, huge sandwiches, attentive and knowledgable service. Thanks, Larry, we wish you great success."}
{"text":"Sorry Abe's I was debating on writting this... I was there back in November when they opened and wrote a wonderful review, unfortunetly I have found that it went down hill in those couple of months.  They soup was so salty that is was inedible, I had them take it back.  I also ordered their cornbeef, the first couple of times was like cornbeef from the eastcoast.  I think they may have gotten the cornbeef from chompies this time, because it was just like theirs.  My husband wanted a cornbeef on whole grain, \"out of whole grain\" really it was noon on a Friday.  I originally thought it was much different then the rest of the Jewish deli's.  I guess to pay those prices I might as well eat at Chompie's or Goldman's.  Hope they change back to the way they were.  I was willing to pay those prices for good Jewish food."}
{"text":"Have had several favorites (of Mine!) from the menu and none have been disappointing.  Service is excellent and finally an \"East Coast Deli\" here in The Valley. For those of us who have been here many years, it is easy to forget what a Great Deli in New York, Boston or Baltimore is like. Abe's will remind you.  My choices:                    Gefilte Fish Appetizer - The BEST and beautifully served!                    Chopped Chicken Liver - Oh my, FABULOUS!                    Potato Latkes - Excellent                     Noodle Kugel - Just GREAT!                    Three Rueben Sliders - Enough for Lunch and it is an Appetizer!  I really do NOT need the rest of the menu, but the Corned Beef is excellent as is the Brisket (although once it was a bit too dry).  Maybe a little more generous with the pickles (two slices look pretty lonely on the place) which are excellent.  A \"go to place\" for lunch, if you love \"Deli!\""}
{"text":"This is a really great place and a gem of the area for sure. I am undecided between 4 and five stars and need a second visit to decide. I don't think any other place in the valley is like this place and offers these kinds of over the top foods. They prepare a multitude of in house meats in the house instead of just serving Boar's Head Brand like many little places do so that right there bumps them to at least four stars just for that. I was told they couldn't find bagels in Arizona that they liked so they send in REAL NEW YORK BAGELS from NEW YORK. I am kicking myself for not bringing home a bagel now. Yes some of the sandwiches are higher priced than what some people are used to paying but it is quality ingredients with a lot of workmanship and a double portion so when you put that into consideration the price is very reasonable.  No matter what you order they present you with a little freebie plate of something of the day. We tried really good pickles.  I was thrilled to see a chopped salad on the menu with salami, corned beef and fresh roasted turkey. This salad FOR SURE was over the top with High end mixed greens not to mention the very long list of added ingredients. Such as, not just corn but roasted corn, eggplant, cauliflower, bell pepper, green beans, kasha, radishes, egg, feta cheese, and crispy bow ties as the croutons. The house made Russian Dressing was very good and flavorful and went well with it. For me this salad was a little too busy but still very good and still seemed much lighter than one of those big old bad boy sandwiches. If I could tweak it I would use a different kasha such as roasted buckwheat because the kasha they used was more like a porridge and that was the only thing I'd change with the not important preference of less ingredients. ($14)  My husband tried the In house Roast Brisket, Pastrami, Corned Beef, Swiss on Rye. It's a giant sandwich and can feed two people. They give you a side of very good potato salad. The potato salad wasn't drippy at all and was made just right. The meats were made just right and this really is like what real sandwich shops were like on the East Cost but they slice the meat thinner here. ($16)  The only thing I really can criticize is our server was very sweet but not trained well. She didn't know the menu well but in time she will.  4.5 stars Mazel Tov Abe's You did very Good.  6-3-13 slight update  Went back over the weekend. We had Rueben sliders and a sandwich. All was still good. Took home a bagel and belly lox. The bagel was still fresh a day later and the belly lox was really awesome."}
{"text":"This place really wants to be as good as Chompie's but it just isn't. It's really large and almost always empty. That should sort of say it all. The food is ok, the service is ok too but nothing about this place made me leave wanting to return or tell people about it eagerly."}
{"text":"it's closed!  i'm bummed out.  best deli i found in the area. it's closed.  it's closed.  it's closed. it's closed"}
{"text":"Well, my wife and I went to Abe's prior to going to see a movie last week.  I had the corned beef sandwich, and the lovely lady had the Turkey dinner.  The corned beef was really good, and the ample supply of meat on this sandwich brings me back to my visits to NYC.  To be honest, it is not  \"quite\" as good, but better than the other delis in the valley (Chompie's, miracle Mile, etc.).  The turkey dinner was excellent, and is now my go to place when I want Thanksgiving in July.  It was really really good, and while they do not shave it off the bird in front of you like at Miracle Mile, the flavor is actually better, and you get a much larger portion.  Better taste plus larger serving wins out every time, in our opinion.  In regards to the service, we were waited on by a charming lad who might have been Scottish or Irish.  He was pretty busy, but still took the time to talk to us about the menu. It was a week ago...forgot his name. He encouraged us to come back, and was very enthusiastic about the menu.  Refills were prompt and he was courteous and funny.  Quite the charmer!  All in all, we will return when we are craving authentic Jewish fare.  The ten dollar bowl of soup sounds a little high, pricewise, but our server told us it is totally worth it due to the amount of stuff they cram into that bowl. Cheers and good luck to this gem tucked away in north Scottsdale.  We will be recommending itto friends."}
{"text":"I just finished having breakfast at Abe's Deli. It was my second meal there in the last 48 hours (really my third if you count the leftovers I are yesterday).  If not for the weather (and the attitude) I'd swear I was in New York City!  The corned beef and pastrami are terrific and the variety of the smoked fish available  (lox, sturgeon, sable) is amazing and delicious.  And, it's all prepared right on the premises.   We couldn't eat everything on the menu but everything one would expect to find at an authentic Kosher-style restaurant was there!  We talked to Larry, the owner, who was a real kick, and couldn't be nicer. A transplanted East-Coaster who really knows his business.   If you're into Deli, Abe's is The Place!"}
{"text":"So, I planned everything for my daughters Bat Mitzvah and of course waited to the week prior to contact Abe's Deli to cater for 50 people at our house on Sunday.  Larry, (the owner) couldn't have done a better job.  The food was fresh and delicious!  The presentation was of the finest I have seen.  I picked it up early Sunday laid it out when I got home and it looked awesome.     We had tuna fish, white fish, egg salad and all of it was perfect.   The bagels were yummy and the sweats WOW!   They crushed it for us!  This is as good as it gets in AZ."}
{"text":"Great service.  Large portions.  A bit tricky to find the place in the dark but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered several box lunches for our team. Here's the shakedown:  Oven roasted turkey on challah bread - very good, challah bread was unusually dry, but after adding mayo and mustard it was A-OK. Plus there is a TON of deliciously roasted bird-meat on the sandwich, so that of course makes it better.   Chicken Caeasr salad AND Steak Caesar salad both were very popular.  Corned Beef sandwich was reportedly VERY flavorful and was a big hit with our resident Irish chap.  Tuna Salad Wrap was godawful. Apparently, the tuna had turned and was described as rancid. Lame. :(  The star of the show was the rugelach (second only to the brownie). I would go back just for that yummy dessert. The flavor of the pastry around the delightful dark chocolate and fruit preserves was fabulous."}
{"text":"Review number 400.  A milestone review because of it's number but also a special review as it was not only one of the best Jewish deli sandwiches I have had but the last meal I may have in quite a while with one of my friends who is moving away and have shared many meals with.  Coming in at mid afternoon on a Sunday we were seated right away and our service remained top notch the entire time we we here.  Unlike most delis in the valley this is a full service restaurant and is priced a little higher.  We shared a chopped liver plate which came with bread, onions and some other stuff.  It was good.  She had brisket and I had pastrami and corned beef on challa bread, which she had suggested to me after our last Jewish deli outing. I had planned on Sweet Republic afterward and no way was that going to happen.  All of our food items were great!"}

They're sooo good and addicting!  The benchmark for me is \"do I crave the Sandwich after I've had it?\"....the answer for both of them is \"yes\".  I did force myself to try a couple other items, just so I didn't get stuck on those 2.  The Burger is very good and so is the Latkes.  The Salami Sandwich, not so much....but that's because it's so plain compared to the other Sandwiches I've had.  Service here is ok, not great....but the food is phenomenal.  One of my new fav's in town.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I was skeptical as the reviews have been so mixed.  However, my friends Suzi and Doc recommended it as they have good cheesecake.  I went for a CB san today and it was very good.  Best I have had since leaving NYC.  Elyse the waitress was terrific.  I am picking up my cheesecake on Sunday for the son-in-law.  I'll write another review after that.  The busser spoke English !  A real PLUS!  Good luck Larry!"}
{"text":"Just returned from a great lunch with my Italian husband and Jewish son-in-law.  They are both deli connoisseurs. They both loved their sandwiches.  I had a reuben that was so big, I brought half home.  I come from back East where ethnic bakeries make the best desserts.  Well, after tasting Abe's homemade apple strudel, heated with caramel on the side  - OMG - I am returning for this alone.  We also tasted the homemade rugelach. I savored the yummy strawberry and the guys inhaled the chocolate. The generous portions, amazing desserts and very friendly staff made our visit most pleasant. We will definitely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Wow, what great service with a smile! And THEN I got my food! Fabulous! The coffee was awesome and so was the Bloody Mary! Next Sunday I am there to watch football too! Go!!"}
{"text":"Not ready for prime time.  This deli needs some seasoning."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Chompies for the last few years and I never thought I would find another Jewish Deli in the Valley that I love, until I came to Abe's.   I have been here a few times now with the wife and her family, and I am hooked. The pastrami is amazing, portions are huge, and the slides are terrific. The Ruben Sliders are amazing, as is the Ruben.   Abe is a really nice guy who takes pride in his work. I have to say what makes Abe's better then the other deli's here is the desert. The apple Strudel is made in house, and it is the most amazing sticky crumbly texture. The rugelach are moist, and the flavors are great."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Abe's and finally did so Sunday.  Wow!!!   The other Scottsdale delis better watch out!  Although the menu is not as large as Chompie's or NYBB, everything we tasted was outstanding.  My husband is a \"purist\" and ordered a pastrami/corned beef combo.  The meats were lean, flavorful and perfectly warm.  It was served on fresh rye bread that must come from NY or Chicago.  I decided to try to raise my cholesterol and ordered the tongue/chopped liver sandwich.  I have never had such thinly sliced tongue, with little fat.  It was piled on the moist Challah and completed with a large portion of excellent chopped liver.  The liver was mild and mixed with sauteed onions.  YUM!!!   The sandwiches are huge and we each took half home.  The complimentary pickles and pickled tomatoes were flavorful and just as they should be.   Service was outstanding:  Sean, our Irish server checked back frequently and made sure beverages were filled.  The restaurant is immaculate and tastefully decorated ---- I can only imagine how busy Abe's will be once the winter residents return ---it will be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"NYC guy eaten at the best delis Carnegie, Nate and Als, Canters I cannot understand a few horrible reviews unless they are  friends of the competition I am happy to have a new deli in Az and one that makes everything in house They are not perfect but working hard on faster service etc Some of the best pastrami, corned beef and brisket Ive ever eaten and its very very CLEAN Arizonans will judge the quality over time. I even waited 20 minutes on a Wed for lunch Try this new clean very special Deli-restaurant  There will always be grumpy, hateful angry people writing nasty reviews  Try it yourself. I am not related in any way to the owner Ken C  FEb 14 soups perfect NOTTT salty I order unseasoned fries  way better PEOPLE as with any restaurant if you dont like something send it back Also servers need direction this is not the RITZ so tell your server you're ina hurry People this is 2013 speak up stop complaining Realize that everything here is homemade even knishes and gefilte fish Rejoice we have a homemade , very clean deli in AZ"}
{"text":"The chicken noodle soup tasted like old dish water today. It for sure wasn't fresh or was the bottom of the pot.  I've eaten here three times now.  The first time it was good. Te second time I tried the pea soup. It was disgusting! The Corned Beef is good.  I would stick to that.  They need work on the soups.  I like that French fries are a choice but they should let you know that it has a seasoning salt on it.  I was  expecting just salt. No flavors.  When they grout them back out with just salt they were great.  I will go one more time and if there is no improvement it will be back to Chompies unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast on Saturday morning and found them locked up tight.  Sadly Abe's has closed."}
{"text":"went here for breakfast and I will not go back had the corn-beef hash omelet it had no taste and the hash was like mush no flavor my friend had lox very small potions and not even an onion with it we will not recommend this place"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Saturday between Christmas and New Years. The service was very good and we liked the food okay: my husband had a reuben and I had a roast beef sandwich. Not nearly as good as Miracle Mile or Chompies. (Actually, I think Wolfley's at Desert Ridge has the best reuben I've tasted in the Valley so far.) We tried them out due to a deal coupon but probably won't go back. Nothing bad, but nothing great either."}
{"text":"I wanted some good deli and decided to come here with a friend for some Sunday afternoon food, and let me tell you, this place is worth it's weight in gold.  When I walked in, the place had plenty of seating, and had some nice décor. I loved how there was plenty of seats in the waiting area, so if it got busy, you didn't have to stand around or anything.  The menu has a good selection of food, with all the good Jewish Deli fixings. I wanted to start off with some Gefilte fish, but the server came back and told me that they were all out? How do you run out of Gefilte fish?!?  I went with the chopped liver instead, and that was really tasty! It didn't look like a lot, but let me tell you, my friend and I split it and it was enough for the two of us. It came with cucumbers, tomatoes, rye bread and some hard boiled eggs.  Ugh, so delicious!  I went with the brisket sandwich on Challah, and it was super tasty! Challah was fresh, brisket was wonderfully done, and even the coleslaw was good. My friend went with a full sandwich and it was HUGE!  It was like whoa, that's like 3 meals worth of food! I could barely finish my half sandwich, so unless your splitting it, I would say go with half!  Overall the experience was great.  I really recommend coming here as it's worth the trip and the food is quite tasty."}
{"text":"Went there Christmas Day as a party of 8. Place was pretty empty and the service was slow, very slow! So slow in fact, I thought we were going to be served on New Years! Out of the 8 of us, 3 had to send back their food and one person just tolerated her bad meal and didn't say anything.  Corned beef was fatty, brisket was dry, au jus for brisket was too salty to use, the forgot the chicken on a chicken Caesar, water glasses empty. Poor quality control and probably lack of proper on site management.  The place is only open 6 weeks as of now. I may give them another try in a few months, if they are still there...or maybe not, as there are plenty of good places."}
{"text":"With much trepidation, I decided to try Abe's Deli the other night for dinner.  The reviews here were so mixed and there were so many 1 star ones, that I was really nervous to go.  I decided, however, that I have to find out for myself.  I LOVE Jewish Deli, and of course, like everyone else, never find one just like home, wherever home may be for each of us.  Well, I still didn't find one like home, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  First of all, the place is lovely.  It is clean and new and bright and lively.  Had a good feel.  Had a great entrance with tons of cool looking sofas.  Very spacious.  The booths have high walls between them, so the guy at the next table can't peep over and look down on your food.  The take out counter was sensational.  I wasn't thrilled with some of the items looking a little crusted over and not saran wrapped or mixed up regularly, but hopefully they will read this and start wrapping the food.  Back to the counter.  It is the largest deli counter I have ever seen in Phoenix.  It is well stocked and looks appetizing.  Prices seem normal.  Deli is never cheap, but this one doesn't seem out of range.  The menu is huge, so it was hard to decide, but we finally ordered the loaded chicken soup that came with HUGE kreplach, (probably largest I have ever seen) a matzo ball, noodles, chicken pieces, and vegetables.  It was $9 for the bowl and it was so big, we took half home.  It was definitely a meal in itself, make that two.  For restaurant chicken soup, it was pretty darn good.  Of course that is an item that everyone likes a different way, but I don't think anyone could complain about this one.  We then had the kishke and calves liver.  The kishke, which I rarely like anywhere, was actually very good as well.  Again, not the way it was when/where I grew up, but I know those days are long gone.  This one was very good and very fresh and hot.  The liver was excellent.  Tender, tasty and well cooked.  I didn't find the portion huge, and probably could have eaten a tad more because it was so good, but it was certainly on the normal size and not the good old U.S.A. supersize.  Somewhere in between might have been perfect tho.  It came with 2 sides and there are many to choose from.  All in all, we were pleasantly pleased and surprised and can't wait to go back and try something else.  I hope this visit wasn't the fluke, and will be the norm for the future.  Oh yes, we also had an excellent server named Jake.  He was so pleasant, knowledgeable, patient and efficient.  He really knew his stuff and was very helpful and sweet.  Can't wait to go back.  I already know what I am going to order."}
{"text":"I've been to Abe's for breakfast and for lunch. I got an Italian hoagie, which was great, except that it was nearly $10. As someone who grew up in Philly, I KNOW hoagies. And no hoagie should cost more than $8 MAX. The breakfast experience was similar. I had a bagel (which was soft and fresh), with a generous helping of cream cheese and lox...the same breakfast I usually get from NY Bagel & Bialy....but it was a bit more expensive. Overall, I would recommend Abe's, but only if NYBB is a full house."}
{"text":"My wife and I just decided on a quick soup and half sandwich and Abe's was the place.  The kreplach soup was wonderful and the brisket on rye with a slice of Swiss made the meal almost too much to eat.  My wife had matzo ball soup and a corned beef on rye and she also struggled to finish.  This was our third visit and gotta say Abe's prices are quite a bit better then their unnamed competition in the valley.  If you're craving some real Jewish deli food this is the place.  Coming from Chicago good Jewish food is not easy to find in Arizona so Abe's got me as a customer for a long time to come. Shout out to our waitress Shayne who is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"We made a great choice to dine at Abe's while in Scottsdale for a family wedding. Did I mention the bride is a nice jewish girl from Long Island? Abe's might be as good as NY-style deli gets in Scottsdale, or all of Arizona for that matter.   Dining with two recent University of AZ graduates wearing their UA t-shirts, Larry (the owner) immediately welcomed us with a shout out to \"his\" UA Wildcats (which was a little surprising since the restaurant interior sports the colors of the much closer ASU).   Our server was quick, efficient and made spot-on suggestions. So let's get to the food already. The classic corned beef and pastrami on rye was, well, \"classic.\" The meat was piled high and the rye bread fresh and tasty, served with potato salad that was also tasty. One of my \"boys\" ordered the pastrami knish sliders, a awesome combination of pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw served between two potato pancakes. A really interesting (and tasty) way to do sliders. And next up is where things get even more interesting. We also had a triple decker sandwich of pastrami, corned beef, cole slaw and Russian dressing on rye bread that elicits that \"how am I going to eat this thing\" sentiment when the plate is set down in front of you. Suffice It to say, we figured it out and it was damn good.  Despite the fact that none of us had room for dessert, we split what must be the best dessert in town. A fudge brownie served with a scoop of ice cream, whipped cream and a cherry on top. Even though we were stuffed before dessert arrived, there was not a single bite remaining when we finished.   Thanks to Larry and his staff for making a memorable weekend that much better with a really great meal."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast during a Saturday Nike ride. Hope we can ride home after all the food. Had the lox and eggs and onions. Great fast and friendly service even with a coupon. Lots of lox and sure seemed like more than two eggs, too, and still hot. My wife had just scrambled and also felt it was more than two eggs. We don't do these kind of breakfasts usually but this will be our place when we do. Always remember to tip on the pre-coupon amount!"}
{"text":"Had my first meal at Abe's (lunch).   I'm a big deli fan and am always looking for the east coast deli experience.  The service was well above average; being both friendly and fast.  The food was mediocre.  I had corned beef sandwich which was decent - but a bit dry, which was surprising since it had russian dressing and coleslaw on it.  The Kaiser roll wasn't great - which impacted the overall taste.  My friend ate a bagel with cream cheese & lox - said it was pretty good.  If I go back - I won't be ordering a deli sandwich...  but i'm not sure that I would go there again."}
{"text":"Although we have had lunch and/or dinner several times at Abe's, today was the first time for breakfast.  And what a great breakfast it was!!  Four of us - each had something different and everyone said their choice was great!  We always enjoy our times at Abe's and we will continue to go there even though it is about a 50 minute drive"}
