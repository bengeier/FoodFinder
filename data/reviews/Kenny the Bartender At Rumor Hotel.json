{"text":"Kenny is the best. Point,blank, period. No bartender comes close. Respectful & very skillful. The best drinks I've ever had. The hotel is garbage but as long as Kenny is here they will at least have a customer at the bar. He should be teaching bartenders in Vegas. I hate doing reviews but everyone needs to check this guy out."}
{"text":"This guy is the best bartender that I have ever ran across! He brings his own tools and ingredients. He muddled everything that you would expect in a blender. I asked him if he had heard of something so unique and phenomenal  and he completely grasped the idea above and beyond and brought it to the highest level of perfection! Kenny can make anything and needs to be in \"Imbibe\" magazine!"}
{"text":"You already know! When a man has his own yelp platform; you are in good company. As I posted previously, the hotel itself needs work.. but KENNY? He is what makes this place amazing! 5stars, and 3 cheers for knowing that he is the textbook definition of hospitality, and delivers proper customer service."}
