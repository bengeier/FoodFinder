{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant!!! It was so bad I don't even know where to begin. But let me hit the highlights - 15 minutes till someone strolled over to take the appetizer order...then she brought the sodas we ordered but not the water. We had to beg the busboy for water, but got no glasses. Finally that arrived. One waitress to serve about 40 people. Very surly attitude. Really bad-tempered. Then I asked if I could get on the wi-fi, as I was visiting from out of town. She told me, \"Only the manager can let you on\". 15 minutes later the manager arrived from wherever, and says \"I'll log you on, but you need to facebook 'like' us within two minutes or I'm cutting the wi-fi\". He warned me 3 times. I'm 50 years old, so I don't have facebook, but I did my best to get on my daughter's account. Long story short - I didn't succeed, and true to his word, he yanked the wi-fi for the whole place, so he could cut me off.  It didn't matter that 10 other people were also inconvenienced, as long as I didn't, God forbid, get any free wi-fi at his expense.  (This is on a $300 check.) The waitress was nowhere to be found, so I eventually canceled my final course, as I was sick and tired of waiting. (I spoke to the busboy, as he was the only staff mmber available.  I finished eating my second course and got ready to leave, when the waitress appeared and said, \"Are you ready for your pu-pu platter now?\" I said, \"Absolutely not!, I canceled that 25 minutes ago. I'm leaving now\" Sh: \"Well, they made it, so you have topay for it.\" Me: \"I canceled it.\" She stalked away, went to the kitchen, brings out the pu-pu platter in a bag, and says, \"Here it is - If you don't want it, take it up with the manager.\" Incredibly rude - incredibly declasse, I would never walk in there again.  And the food?  Average. There are much better places in Montreal. Chez Benny is incredible, there's an awesome sushi dairy place. Every other place in Montreal that I've been to I have loved, except for this dump.  If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Stumbled here while we were looking for some lunch before meeting for some business. It was in the area of our colleagues, who recommended Ernie & Ellie's as they had a variety of different options of food to eat. They sure were right! It took some time to just look over the menu, let alone decide what we wanted to eat. My hubby opted for the Pad Thai which was surprisingly pretty tasty. It was not your usual pad thai, but it still tasted good. I got the sweet potato fries platter which was crunchy and the spicy aioli sauce was delicious! They had a lot of different types of food from chinese, thai, japanese, to greek/mediterranean, and american. All KOSHER!!   The prices were on the high side, but you can't expect any less for a kosher restaurant. And tacking on the 15% tax and service charge, you're almost at $100 for a group of 4.   It is located in a run down mall with half of the area open for rental. If you're not familiar with the area, it may be better to go down the highway to the next plaza over for other options, but Ernie & Ellie's is a decent option!"}
{"text":"they have been around for 20+ years and with good reason. the menu is huge with an almost overwhelming selection (lots of kids options too). prices are very very good for kosher sit-down and there is lots of free parking inside and out at decarie square. the Chinese food is  very authentic, i recommend the general tao and the crispy orange beef."}
{"text":"The location is a bit weird (a large family restaurant with banquet hall services located in the dilapidated Decarie Square Mall)   With A-Ok food, for Kosher standards, the decor has been recently updated, making the stay more pleasant. It's extremely family friendly, so no worries if your child decides to have meltdowns all over the floor and jump on tables. The staff are very good and well trained, so they really know how to help you out if you have a two-year-old."}
