{"text":"LOVE this place! The staff is always super nice! Food is great! You can make it as healthy or as bad as you want. Also, great if you need to grab something quick for lunch."}
{"text":"Terrible service yesterday.  59 minutes after I ordered my food nothing arrived.  I reminded them twice and he said I need to be patient.  Food was up on the counter but no one was delivering to the tables .  Several people asked for a refund and walked out.  I was with someone who got his food otherwise I would have left sooner. I asked for a refund after waiting one hour.  No apologies offered.  Very rude. 
The general manager contacted me and apologized and gave me two meal tickets.  I tried it again and the guy that I had the bad experience with is now working back in the kitchen away from customer service.  It's a nice alternate for healthy food choices."}
{"text":"very clean, though it should be since it just opened. service was quick and friendly.the sushi was good, az roll.nothing exceptional. surf and turf bowl was the same. made me wish I went to pei wei or shimogamos. but it was close..."}
{"text":"You have to pay extra for any veggies when you build your own meal. Expensive for lunch if you build your own unless you like bland."}
{"text":"Good service. My bowl was just chicken and rice, so not much to talk about there except there was not much chicken given the cost. Try Blue Fin downtown on Central, way better (and not corporate as others have noted this place is). This gets a ok if you need calories but otherwise a ton of better options around here."}
{"text":"The vibe and decor and so cool and quirky. The service was good.  I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was a big portion for the price.  I felt really good and healthy after eating it but taste was not that great.. So if you're just looking for a healthy meal this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Solid. It is impossible these days to get adequate vegetables when eating out and quick. This place solves that and is yummy to boot!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, and I appreciated the well-marked gluten-free options. I did a build-your-own bowl with salmon and double veggies, and I was impressed by the size of the piece of salmon they gave me. The selection of veggies was nice and made it feel like I was eating fairly healthy, especially for fast food. It was great having a GF teriyaki sauce, too, since most teriyaki has wheat in it."}
{"text":"Great, healthy food. The veggies are great, the chicken delicious, and the sauces are really perfect. This is clearly a place that is popular among the bodybuilding community and you can tell why: clean eating and tasty."}
{"text":"Service great and food was super, made my own bowl, price is reasonable, not to busy for just opening, but then again it's HOT outside. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Wonderfully forgettable

1. Food was bland, tasteless, and the bottom of my bowl was filled with water.
2. Service was among the worst I have had in a long LONG time. i.e. Water being spilled on our group, snarky comments when there was and issue with the food.
3. While this was a bad experience the manager didn't notice the entire time all of this was going on. When we did bring her attention to the issues she did make it right but to little  to late."}
{"text":"Came here with my buddy Leo to get our grub on. I did the build your own bowl and was really happy with the portion size and serving size of the vegetables! Delicious and they have a large amount of iced tea choices. I like to wash my hands before I eat and their restrooms are singles. So it took awhile, might be nice to have a hand sanitizer pump in the hall by the restroom."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!!!  Excellent service, always ready to serve you!  The food is fresh made to order, you choose what goes into your bowl when you order the build your own.  Great alternative to fast food when eating out, easier to make healthy food choices.  I eat here frequently and would def recommend it to my friends!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was ok. Came in for lunch on a Monday about 12:30 and ordered a Yakitori bowl. Their ramen noodles are more like spaghetti noodles, but it was all tasty. Biggest turn off for me was when I went to find a seat. It's not a very busy day, but when I went to find a spot I settled for the only semi clean table I could locate. Half of the 30 or so tables were dirty, with dirty dishes or remnants of the previous meal (or both) on them.

Overall, not impressed and likely won't give it another try."}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened. My wife and I were both disappointed.

Because we wanted to support local business we decided to go again. Unfortunately we were even more disappointed. The food is flavorless and contains mediocre ingredients. Also very overpriced! 

We understand that you are trying to offer healthy food and we commend you for that. However you are doing more damage to the concept of eating healthy by demonstrating the complete absence of flavor.

This only convinces people that healthy is boring. 
Not  true! Lots of places get it right. Tokyo Joe's is sadly a place that I will scratch off my list."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and really delicious. I dont live too close to a tokyo joes so whenever i get a chance to stop by i definitely go.  The workers here are awesome too, everyone is so friendly and helpful :)"}
{"text":"The food overall is pretty good , however after I placed my order the cashier looked as if something unpleasant had  happened...it was odd! the whole place seemed kinda awkward as I was waiting ......overall this place could use a little more enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high for the quality! Good food but not spectacular! The atmosphere is amazing, I felt a really good vibe eating in."}
{"text":"Staying in a hotel near Tokyo Joes. Thought I would try it out. Poke is one of my favorite foods. I ordered the Ahi bowl and was a bit disappointed in the amount of Ahi in it, thus the 3 stars. It was good, but needed to have more toppings. The good: taste was fresh and Ahi seemed fresh. The toppings were also fresh. The poke bowl is big enough, seemed to be full of rice and not many toppings. I like rice so that's was good, but as I stated before, MORE AHI AND TOPPINGS PLEASE."}
{"text":"If you meal prep or eat healthy this place is on point.  You can get 1lb of delicious chicken for $10 and some sides if you want.  Then you know you are eating healthy all week and don't have to cook.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I dont think I have ever given a 1-star review to a restaurant yet. Well Tokyo Joes, your my first. 
Tried this place for the first time tonight, a coworker suggested it and I figured why not give it a shot, its just down the street from me. **note to self: don't take restaurant suggestions from coworker anymore!**

I cant believe I spent $25 on such garbage. My bf and i ordered the following:

Yakitori Bowl...gross sauce that looked like brown jello, noodles were blah. entirely disappointed.

Yo Roll....... I've never had such poor quality sushi. Flavor-less! and more rice than filling. This roll supposedly had mango, I might have needed a magnifying glass to spot it. 

Mojo Bowl.....Looks just like a Lean Cuisine frozen meal! The catch? A frozen meal tastes better

Arizona Roll.....Another disappointment, bland roll. only flavor was the jalapeno on top. 

Needless to say, I'll never be returning here. Spend a few more bucks and go have GOOD Sushi at RA, Pei Wei is on the other side of the street too and they have much better Asian food."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special, gave it a chance, but the third time did it!! Okasa bowl, i think its callled, did not see any chicken, and the cbicken i did see was very little,.plus the egg is placed on top of my bowl which is Not! Fried, it runs!!! I waned to throw up!!
Will never return!!!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's = WHAT A JOKE!

Our family of 4's first time ever. Paid over $45, and each \"LARGE\" bowl contained portions enough to fit inside a Starbucks' SHORT cup. We paid $1.50 extra per bowl for vegetables. What came out were 3 broccolis, 4 snap peas, 7 asparagus. Yes, I counted, because I knew I was going to write this review! 

The food quality and portion were subpar, and definitely NOT worth $45! 

Our overall experience, from walking through the entrance doors, to the order counter, to receiving our orders, to exiting were lackluster, to say the least. The staff were unfriendly and unwelcoming, not outright rude, but extremely impersonable.

Next time, when we go out for teriyaki chicken, we're going back to YOGI's GRILL --- more quality, grilled chicken and more of what we pay for with friendly service, and not for $45!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Their food is fresh to order, healthy & delicious! I'm soo glad they opened up close to my house & are even offering discount cards for customers. I've tried their BYO Bowls & sushi. It's all amazing!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food, so many choices! Love that I was able to find a healthy teriyaki bowl with chicken and veggies for around $5. They also have an iced tea bar, appreciate multiple alternative options for low sugar/low calorie besides water or diet coke. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Soup was very under flavored and the chicken in the, soup was dry like they boiled the chicken and dumped the water. My wife had a teriyaki bowl and it wasn't bad but will not be going back"}
{"text":"If you order Take Out at this place, don't leave without checking your order. 
I ordered TOFU Spring Rolls. It wasn't until I returned to work 15 minutes later that I discovered, when I bit into one of them, that it was not TOFU, but rather CHICKEN. 
AND I'm Vegan. I also got an Ichigo salad. Thank Goodness. Although they had the brains to get the tofu part right with the salad, it wasn't that great. NOTHING like the Gilbert location. SO very disappointed in the Chandler location. I will never return there again. Even though it made me give at least one star to post, NO STARS FOR YOU!!"}
{"text":"We don't have much (read any) experience with sushi and this looked like a reasonable place to try it out.  We went one time without trying the sushi, partly because we didn't know where to start.  The manager convinced us to come back and give it another try.

We started off with the spring rolls which were delicious.  The fresh, high quality vegetables are really their strength.  We had two orders of the Zushi boxes and tried most of Sushi menu.  We don't have any reference point to compare to, but we liked everything, although the dragon sauce was a little too spicy for my wife.  It's a place we will go back to and glad we found a way to try it in an unintimidating way.

I really like these restaurants like Chipotle and Panda that operate in between fast food and sit down dining.  If you haven't tried sushi, go in and ask for some recommendations and give it a try.  It's really not something to be afraid of."}
{"text":"I regret eating here. You can get better California rolls at the grocery store. The yakatori was so bad I felt like crying."}
{"text":"The definition of just ok. Super convenient location for me, and it does have some good healthy options. Visually it presents nicer than Tokyo Bowl, Yogis, or Yoshis, but it is priced maybe 10 - 15 percent higher as well. Unless you go with the cheapest of menu options and water, you are not getting out for under $10, so that is a little misleading on the Yelp page. 

By looking at the menu, you would think that they are pretty flexible about substitutions, as they have a make your own bowl with the ingredients listed. They have several teas, and standard soft drinks, with a cooler at the checkout with beer and wine. All good things in my book.

The problems start with the service, which is all out and in front of everyone with their open kitchen and \"helpful\" staff. However the types of employees they hire act like teenagers on Mountain Dew being left alone for the first time in their lives. Meaning that they are a little wild, the subject matter I have heard discussed while dining has been inappropriate for public, and rather crude and stupid comments made towards each other while essentially horsing around behind the counter, throwing things across the kitchen, laughing hysterically (and likely spit flying out of their pierced, pubic hair covered faces) that are in no way appropriate to professional kitchen conduct. 

I understand the culture of working in restaurants, and yes, there is a certain level of excepted \"youthful lack of tact\" among young men and women working in a low paying industry, often long and irregular hours. I would just advise to keep it discrete, and realize that EVERYONE can hear you guys. Also when you go on your \"break\" outside and are huffing huge vape clouds, while talking on your cell phones, you may want to again be aware of your surroundings. 

Aside from the staff acting juvenile and loud, and clearly enjoy talking to each other more than talking to the customers, it is nice that they bring you your food, however the last employee to do so literally had his thumb inside of my bowl touching the food when he set it down in front of me. When I made the comment that I hopped his hands were clean, he rolled his eyes and said he didn't touch any of the food. 

On another occasion a young cranky male employee showed off his fancy attitude at the check out by interrupting before I could even finish ordering the food I was interrupted with the question \"You want a drink too?\", with my response being, that yes, but only under the conditions that my order is taken correctly and that it is very important to me to not have almonds in my meal as I am allergic. This was apparently another eye rolling worthy offence on my part.

Anyway, its ok, probably better when it is busy to help drown out the sound of stupidity coming from the back. I threw away my rewards card after the thumb in the food incident and wont be going back, but I have a short tolerance for repeated mediocrity."}
{"text":"Cool concept, the restaurant was also very neat and clean. The food however, lacked some flavor. Maybe I was expecting too much, but for the same price I could have went to another place that was more palatable. Other than the bland flavor, it was overall a good experience. staff at the register was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I get the concept.. But there's much tastier and fresh foods available at other restaurants. I tried the OYAKO bowl which had little to no flavor and the chicken was very dry. I chose udon noodles to go with the bowl, but I think that was a bad decision, as the noodles were overcooked.

I'd give it two stars just because the environment was really nice (modern setting). It's quite possible I just caught them on the wrong day (it wasn't busy at all, but who knows)."}
{"text":"You're better off going to the Pei Wei down the street. Food is on par with frozen microwave food.
l knew I should've just got Jimmy John's but I had to try something new. Thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place doesn't have higher ratings. The food is healthy, quick, delicious and at a good price. Also like that they have vegan/ gluten free options and is a great alternative for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I should have known better. Joe isn't a japanese name and trying to pass the this off as acceptable sushi is a crime."}
{"text":"Had the steak bowl with udon noodles and the crab cheese wonton roll. Steak was very tender and juicy. The wonton rolls were fantastic. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very laid back, everyone was super freiendly. 

Will definitely be coming back to try something different."}
{"text":"1/2 Birthday entree for free!! Oh, that's right! You want to get on Tokyo Joe's email list. I get specials/promos emailed a couple times monthly (bogo's, etc..) & the Bday meals certainly warrant the effort. Good food which has always seemed fresh."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now.   First time had the teriyaki chicken bowl with veggies.  Love the flavor of the teriyaki sauce and the chicken was very tender and veggies were fresh.  Second time I went the service was very slow and our table was dirty, even after the server wiped it down it was still sticky.  I tried the curry chicken bowl with veggies and rice the and the curry was a little strong but the chicken was good as were the veggies.  I think I'll try it as takeout next time around."}
{"text":"This place is awesome . I had the vegetarian sushi and it was perfect. The service was great and the employees were extremely knowledgeable about their choices. Thank you Jaime and Michael for vegan recommendations. YOU GUYS ROCK !"}
{"text":"You could order anything and it doesn't really matter what because it all tastes the same. I would rather go to the store and get a package of 0.22 Ramen and eat that at home"}
{"text":"I come here a lot and the food is pretty good but there's always a problem here and it's the employees. As far as I can see it the only hard working people are the chefs and other than that I get this constant attitude and ignorance from everyone else. The girls taking my order are never helpful and they just respond in very vague responses. They seem to have no knowledge of the different foods they sell here. Today specifically I witnessed"}
{"text":"Oh my God, Tokyo Joe's. This place seems to have everything that goes into a fantastic quick serve Japanese restaurant. They've got a great atmosphere, some seriously tasty (and fresh) food, and a great management team to go with it. 
The experience: The line moves quickly every time I go in (keeping their promise that is stated by the door - hilarious). The cashiers are all very sweet and knowledgable about the menu and the different options. The management has touched base with me an multiple occasions to make sure my table and I are happy, and go above and beyond what is \"required\" to have a great eating experience. Not to mention the restaurant is clean and organized, making it easy to feel comfortable and eat a relaxing lunch.
The food: these guys do bowls the right way. Lots of options from protein to carbs and right down to sauce customization (I mix the spicy yakitori peanut sauce with the tangy green dragon curry; seriously, try it). I've yet to have anything brought to me that was less than what I ordered, and the helpings are generous so go hungry! 
Overall: this place is a all around knockout. From a casual spot to grab some grub after a gym session, or a low-key spot to have a business meeting and get some healthy food without a tab that'll piss off your boss. Keep being amazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Food was quality! Wife had the spicy teriyaki and I had a tuna poke bowl. Both were excellent. Staff is engaging and attentive. Prices are up there a bit but well worth it in my opinion. Amazing selection and quality iced tea! They also have meal prep with many different choices for fitness folks on the go! Great restaurant I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"How have I not heard of this place before today. 
Great food. 
So nice so have cooked veggies that still have a snap to them. No baby food mush here!
Seriously healthy options. Clean location. 
The tea bar is key. And customer service is great., maybe the manager, but he was great. Super friendly. I wish there was one closer to my work."}
{"text":"Ramen soup had no flavor, noodles were not ramen but overcooked spaghetti, barely any bean sprouts and too many watercress...could of spent a lot less if I cooked my own ramen at home....unfortunately will not be back to give other dishes a try."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed this place!! Imagine Panda Express and Kyoto Bowl mixed into 1.. but with WAAAAAY better ingredients... my chicken came out grilled and sliced and ready for the teryaki sauce... I took mine to go with the Udon noodles and it was great.. I will eat mine in house next time as it can only be better.. the prices are reasonable as well.. nice spot for a quick meal that isnt your everyday drivethru"}
{"text":"I became very ill after eating Sushi at this location on 4/21/15.  I should have known when it smelled way too \"fishy\".  My bad for eating it.  Shame on me getting sushi from a place like this.. seriously very very sick.  Wonder if anyone else got sick that evening?"}
{"text":"This little noodle and sushi place is fantastic . Fast service, large portions, friendly service and great east to understand menu. Regular portion is big enough for a super hungry lunch or dinner... Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or something but I only got a few of the special rolls and it wasn't anything special. and well I'm Asian so maybe the way I criticize sushi is much more strict than what every other person would say but I just don't find anything special about this place. The Nutella strawberry roll or whatever for dessert was quite a disappointment too because it was literally a piece of strawberry smothered in Nutella and in a rolled up piece of bread. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from that but the flavors of each roll didn't even blend together, I tasted each ingredient separately and it was weird. I hear people always hyping over the teriyaki bowls so I guess I should've ordered that instead..."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect example of you get what you pay for.  Real chicken breast, True, high quality ingredients don't come cheap.   I hope they stay with the high quality.   I had the tuna sushi rolls last trip.  Great flavor, side of ginger and wasabi was perfect. 
I will go back, and I will recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This has become a family favorite. Food is healthy, fast and delicious. Variety of choices between sushi, rice bowls and salads. Our favorite rice bowl is Mojo which has chicken, pineapple, egg, carrots. If you are looking for something spicy, I liked the green curry shrimp bowl. However you can make your own rice bowl combos too.

If you like iced teas there are quite a selection to choose from. Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Good food, good value.  The dragon sauce is perfect, a good kick but not over the top."}
{"text":"Consistently great service and fresh food. Best is 2 for 1 sushi Mondays!  I eat here all the time and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast and convenient Asian food.   Good taste at reasonable prices. I had the Mo Joe bowl.  A little on the sweet side for my taste buds, but enough variety for any taste bud. Didn't try the sushi this time.  Too full from the large bowl.  Will eat here again and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"First time here and I was super happy about the food. Everything tastes fresh. The only thing I would have liked to seen more of is the chicken that goes in the \"make it yourself bowl\". Next time I'll just order extra chicken to it. Other than that I will be definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"For a fast Japanese type place this place was really good. This was my first time here and I had the basic teriyaki sauce with chicken (I know...how original and adventurous...).  The dish came with lots of vegetablesthat were done perfectly. I would definitely come back when I'm up for a fast but tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Don't get the big bowl, they just pack in extra soggy spaghetti noodles in with about 1oz of chicken/other ingredients. I'm not a picky eater, this was just too ridiculous and dissapointing not to mention. The Yakitori sauce is awesome, though. Probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"A bunch of people from my office were ordering it, so I decided to partake. I had an udon noodle bowl with green curry. Very, very mediocre food. I don't understand how that can be called curry. Their noodles were extremely watery.  I would not recommend their food if you're looking for taste."}
{"text":"Love this place! The employees are so chill, they never raise an eyebrow at my weird orders. The food is good and fresh and can be pretty healthy if you want it to be. I once suggested to my mom we go here but she insisted she didn't like Japanese restaurants, told her this place was different, she said if she didn't like it I was buying her food... After just a couple bites she said \"ok you're off the hook\".

Love the decor, wifi. I wish they were open later, and that they had a drive thru window... The salmon leaves a little to be desired so I just order the other meats."}
{"text":"What a great option when looking for a quick meal that's healthy and delicious. I plan on making this a regular stop. The chicken lettuce wraps were delicious, fresh and so healthy. I love the avocado and the cucumber salad and rice noodles that were part of this delicious mix.  I don't drink soft drinks (my weak attempt at being healthy) but they had several great choices of fresh brewed teas my favorite was raspberry Hibiscus sweetened with stevia, so wonderful. My husband had a rice bowl with spicy Dragon sauce; I think for the average person this would be spicy for us it was flavorful, but still good. All and all Tokyo Joe's had many choices and we can't wait to go back to try them all! Best of luck to this business in this new location!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh! Left feeling full but not heavy! Fresh veggies, wild caught seafood-trendy vibe. Will return!"}
{"text":"Very fresh, high quality, good prices. Got the cali tartare roll and tried the chicken teriyaki. Both were delicious. They use real crab in their rolls"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's is a great find in Chandler! First time here Friday night and all the food was impeccably cooked, seasoned and delicious. Fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"First off, Great Friendly service!
This establishment is very modern, very clean, and the food is wonderful!, I got sushi and I built a bowl both were on point! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I was excited when they opened and the menu sounded awesome. It's not. Sushi is horrid. Food taste like a canned or bagged item. Pei Wei  and Rhumbis across the street is a much better option . Too bad. Been there twice and got the same results. Service was good and decor was nice."}
{"text":"We were searching for a semi-quick dinner place we hadn't tried and decided to go here since its down the street from our place. The service was very friendly and the first thing asked was if we had been there before (we looked a bit lost while staring at the menu). Here, you will find some traditional food items but the twist that Tokyo Joe's offers is their, create-your-own bowl. They have your meat options, carb, sauce, and veggies (for an extra charge). I was really in the mood for something simple and something I know so I chose the white chicken with white rice and teriyaki sauce (very original, right?). They did have a similar bowl already made in their menu; however, a lot of their signature made bowls had egg and other ingredients I'm not a fan of, so rather than taking everything out, I just wanted to make my own. 
My fiancé also ordered the spicy tuna and Arizona rolls. He ordered it just for kicks, we weren't expecting it to be the most amazing roll we ever had. The food came out quickly so that was nice since we were starving! I was expecting the chicken to be BBQ'd but it wasn't but it was still good. They did, however, pour on the teriyaki sauce like it was going out of style. It was way too much and overpowering so I tried my best to eat some \"dry\" areas of the rice. The rolls were not good, we only tried one each; but like I said, we weren't expecting them to be amazing either. Overall, the bowls were ok, sushi rolls - no. I would suggest telling them to take it easy on the sauce, unless of course you love it being drenched on. :)"}
{"text":"After going to this location for over a year now last night was my last time.  Thank goodness my entree was free otherwise i would have been screaming for my money back. First of all the employee managing the cash register was less than pleasant and her presentation was worse. Its a real turn off when you are served by a messy person. Messy hair, dirty nails, wrinkled clothes...need i go on? Placed my order and then watched as it sat on the back counter for over five minutes...no hot lights, no warming tray. Cashier was too busy with other customers to serve it. I finally had to go up and get it myself. Then the worse part.. of course cold food. Soggy mushy white rice, omg even the chicken was mushy and the vegetables not even cooked.  I couldn't even begin or finish it. Very disappointed. This was their second chance with me and the last. The last time i went i had a take out order and i ended up with someone else's food. Didn't notice until i was already home. Sayonara Tokyo Joes."}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick roll. Limited selection but for what they do have , they won't disappoint. I usually het their dragon sauce on almost everything."}
{"text":"Found the restaurant by accident.   Once we walked We were greeted by a gentleman who explained the entire menu to us. It was a no-brainer because they had so many options had a very good price.   Food was tasty and portions were large.  We will be frequenting this often."}
{"text":"We eat at Tokyo Joe's frequently.  Initially we were drawn to it because our son is celiac and they very amazing about accommodating the gf needs.  Very friendly &  delicious.  We are very limited on where we can eat and we were excited to have this fresh option.  Sadly over the last 2 months things have changed.  The food is still delicious (5 stars) but the service has declined.  The smiles and friendliness have disappeared and it isn't as nice as it was.  The last time we ordered I hoped it was a fluck but tonight it was confirmed.  Sad, really."}
{"text":"The food here is very healthy and delicious, but the staff leaves something to be desired. The atmosphere is cool, clean, and inviting. Unfortunately, I didn't receive a greeting upon arrival, no smiles, no warmth, had to ask about the discount card, and no thank you. Hummm, this place definitely needs some help in the hospitality department."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place but the food was not good. 

My daughter had Yakitori bowl, which like other reviewers have mentioned came with a gross brown sauce that had no flavor. The bowl was bland. 

I had the MoJoe bowl and it was not good at all. It was overly sweet and the rice was mushy. 

I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"I decided to try Tokyo Joe's for the first time last week. I ordered the Build-Your Own Bowls with Steak. The regular size was more than enough for me, and it tasted great! I decided to try something different today, and went with the Tuna Poke Bowl - YUM!!!! The flavor and quality of everything in the bowl was excellent! The restaurant was packed when I went, which I take as a good sign. The staff was very friendly, and the turnaround time from ordering, to out the door, was great. I love having a healthier on-the-go option, and I'm pretty sure this is going to be my new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's really is as good as it gets for clean, healthy food that tastes amazing! I've been dining at Tokyo Joe's since we lived Colorado and I think I've dined at every location in Arizona since moving back. My wife and I order off the Joe's Meal Prep menu for fitness-minded people who want to get set-macro meals that fit their fitness goals. Personally, I love the build-your-bowl option with Stevi-Yaki (sugar free teriyaki) on the side. The veggie options are awesome and the sushi is always fresh. 

My wife and I go to the Mesa (Val Vista) location every Sunday cause we get to see Cady Quarles who is their all-star employee. She takes the time to know her customers and makes you feel like special. She always has a smile on and greets us by name. And when I order the jars of Stevi-Yaki to take home she always hooks me up (filled to the rim!). If someone from Joe's corporate is reading this and you don't know Cady you should. She everything you could want in a representative of your franchise!

It goes without saying but I highly recommend Tokyo Joe's!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here and consistently receive great service and good food. The establishment is clean and the people are friendly. On more than one occasion, my addict card was a little screwy (and we later discovered that one of those times was because of an error on my part) and the staff was more than willing to accommodate and assist us in figuring out the issue, even though I'm sure it was a pain in the butt to do so."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Tokyo Joe's on a fairly regular basis. We've been traveling this summer so we hadn't been there in a little while. Two days ago we went in and I brought my \"loyalty card\" (buy 12 meals, 13th is free) for our free meal, because we filled the card up! The lady at the counter informed me they stopped this loyalty program last month and they would not honor my free meal. She explained they have a new program - that they would give us points for our old cards but we would need to register the card first and the points might not be enough for a free meal now. I asked to speak to a manager but of course there was no manager on duty or anyone with customer service skills to remedy the situation. It's a shame they've lost good, loyal customers over a $6 bowl.  

On a side note...the last time we ate there, the salmon was hardly edible so maybe ownership has changed??"}
{"text":"My first time was on Saturday August 2. I ordered a big tofu bowl with veggies and hot peanut sauces. First I would like to thank the person at the register for helping me figure out what is vegan friendly and being honest with me instead of bsing me around. Second the food was delicious and was fast to make. It was very colorful and not \"bland\" like these basic folks with no taste buds would say but hey that's just me. To each it's own. The spicy peanut sauce are to die for! It was very creamy and peanuty. Third the service was great when it was needed and they had a ready to help sorta attitude which was great but it was basically help yourself. (I.e. Getting your own drinks) the only service that was at the beginning; ringing up the order. I mean they even brought the food to you what more do you want?  lol
   Overall it was a great first experience and I would recommended it to anyone that loves healthy Japanese food. Great non-bland food and great service when needed!!! New favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Great fast food alternative. Very healthy dishes and ingredients. The staff was helpful since I t was my first time."}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time so I decided to look at the menu online, seen a sushi roll that I was curious to try and called in the order. Once arriving I walked up to a counter where two girls stood chit chatting then I said I'm here for a to-go order. I guess the roll was still being assembled so I proceeded TO have a seat and wait which I did not mind. I then was told it was ready and went out the door ...I took a look before leaving the parking lot and Boom sweet chili sauce and panko crumbs were no where to be found I know this may not seem like a big deal but hey I got a tofu roll and I would like a lil flavor. So I walked back in and they had the nerve to seem annoyed which you think it would be the other way around. I simply wanted what I read online they just didn't seem to care or want to be bothered ... I almost asked for a refund because there attitudes were ridiculous. --------

I left but when I got home I did call to speak to a Manger not to yell and scream but to simply make sure this doesn't happen to another customer but longer story short i never got to speak to a manger !!  


NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOT I WAS THE ONLY CUSTOMER"}
{"text":"I like the build a bowl, where you as your protein, sauce and veggies. I love the fresh ingredients and always tastes healthy! Great tea bar too! New favorite Chandler noodle spot!"}
{"text":"Great menu...taste, quality and $ is much better than pei wei.  2 for 1 sushi night every Monday and the rewards program is very beneficial."}
{"text":"Really good fast and delicious. This place is always full but not so bad to find a seat surprisingly."}
{"text":"I usually use their app to order my food so that it is ready and already paid for when I get there, all I have to do is walk in and tell them my name. I appreciate that I can get healthy food at a good price and quick when I don't want to cook. We also ordered for an office meeting of 13 people and our orders were all correct, pick up was easy and everyone liked it."}
{"text":"A star for cleanliness, a star for service and star for concept. However, I feel a little ripped off because the green curry shrimp dish consisted of 5 shrimp and an amount of vegetables you could fit on a dessert spoon. No shortage of noodles which was what filled me up, but for $8.45 I was expecting more. My husband opted for the no carb version and paid an extra $1.30 for double the veggies. By the looks of it, he got 2 dessert spoons of veggies on a pile of bean sprouts. We went from the restaurant to Safeway so he could get some deli chicken since his meal  ($9.75) had not even made a dent in his appetite. Too many better alternatives to go back here."}
{"text":"Bento box is my go to. A tad bit of everything.  Some of the bowls come with a ton of rice and you end up consuming every bit.  Can't say enough awesome things about this place!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and tried the yakitori bowl...but didn't realize that the yakitori sauce was something way different than the normal teriyaki sauce. But, since I had ordered it, I tried to eat it still even though the yakitori sauce was definitely not something that I liked. 

Unfortunately, I was only able to get a bite or two more down before not being able to continue. Others might like the sauce, it just wasn't to my liking. So I asked if there was any way I could replace my order with just a regular chicken bowl, and the individual behind the counter was so nice about it, gave me zero hassle and was so accommodating that I felt it warranted a review. I know that this is a fast food type lunch place that doesn't serve high class cuisine- it is what it is. But the service and courtesy they showed was much appreciated and that alone will have me come back in the future."}
{"text":"Nobody has reviewed the salads and since I had the MOST amazing salad, I wanted to leave a review.  I ordered the Tataki salad.  It was probably one of the best salads I've ever had in my life.  I could eat this salad every day.  Fresh, tasty, great combo of flavors and textures.  If you like ahi tuna and avocado then you can't go wrong with this choice.
My husband got the green curry shrimp bowl and it was just okay."}
{"text":"Every penny well spent.  $8 for a great amount of food.  Teriyaki and veggies were on point.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"With a lot of the negative reviews I was a little concerned but had heard from others that they really liked Tokyo Joe's. One being that they use fresh ingredients, organic if they can, wild salmon, etc.  Well I'm glad I listened to my friends and NOT the reviewers that gave negative reviews. I had the lettuce wraps. The chicken was tender and juicy, the veggies flavorful and crisp, and the dipping sauces wonderful!  I look forward to returning and trying something else!  It's about time we can get fresh, healthy fast foods!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, but they're lacking in customer service. I waited in line for about 10 min and waited 10 minutes for my food. It was during lunch hour, so they should have more then 1 person at the register. The lady at the register (didn't catch her name because she had a jacket on) wasn't friendly at all. To be honest she looked like she didn't want to be there....
I ordered a bento box with teriyaki chicken, rice, edamame, and spicy tuna sushi! The food was actually REALLLLLYYY good with the exception of the sushi...it didn't look or taste fresh at all. I only ate 1 piece because I was scared I was going to get sick, but everything else was delicious!

I'll definitely be back and hopefully they get it together with their customer service skills!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened up near me. So it makes for an easy and quick stop. I called the order in,so it would be ready when I got there. 
It was ,however they prefer you to do it on line, or even better on the App.
I am not a millennium ,so I am grateful to anything on line. If I am in a hurry , I just want to call it in. 
Anyway, when I got there to pick it up, it was ready. Also nice and hot still when I got it home. We got a Salmon Bowl, with Brown Rice and green curry. I added vegetables to it as well. $1.35 extra. They were crisp and Fresh so not to bad.
However, that makes it nearly $10.00. The other item was A Steak Bowl, Brown rice ,Teriyaki, with the add on as something called a, (No Brainer) which is a mixture of all the Vegetables.
I would go there again for sure. I really liked the curry and the Salmon was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, but in short words I had better Sushi. 4 rolls for $1 each I don't think so.... I'm sticking with Sushi Station conveyor belt sushi bar 4 rolls starting at $1.75 . Tokyo Joe's not a lot Sushi to choose from one of the orders too too spicy and no flavor had to blend it with the wasabi and Soy sauce."}
{"text":"Was recommended this gem by a friend and I was not disappointed! Ghengis Grill meets Panda Express but so much better! Becoming an #addict! My children love that edamame comes with their bento box! We are eating our way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Saturday night called in a take our order and was told 20-25 minutes. It was 55 minutes actually. They \"lost\" my order but they were able to reproduce it off the register somehow. We waited about 15 minutes before she realized this. The food was tasty though so I will give them another try. Bento boxes were tasty. The sushi was good nothing special. Good take out sushi my husband said. 
They gave us a \"sorry , my bad\" card for 2 free entrees in the future. Funny that they have these cards pre printed. 
I'll give them another try. Maybe on a weeknight."}
{"text":"My go to place when I am craving oriental food.  I have been to Tokyo Joe's in Denver and Phoenix.  I am addicted to the Yakitori bowl.  This dish doesn't change, no matter what location.  Flavorful, just the right spices and ingredients to satisfy that appetite.  I really must try a different dish next time, but it will be a hard choice, as everything looks good.  Restaurant is clean, nice atmosphere, friendly staff.  And did I mention prices?  A good meal for your $."}
{"text":"First time in and was pleased,the food was good and tasty...but it is a bit on pricey end for what is received...but will return simply because of good service, and a clean restaurant. Had rice bowl with white meat chicken, and forgot the name of sauce...but it was the spiciest...good. Concept is good, and you \"build\" your own bowl."}
{"text":"Not cool, for what you charge for a teriyaki bowl!! You would think you might get more than five slices of  very thinly cut chicken. I will absolutely go back to \"Teriyaki Kitchen \" to get my bowl. At least \"teriyaki kitchen\" gives you your monies worth... That is why I hate chain food places!!!! I must say the customer service was great. But does not make up for the crappy food!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, every time everyone is nice. The restaurant is cleanly. Today I ordered a meal, rice was supposed to be included in that meal (which it wasn't) not a big deal, right? So a phone call back in just to inform them felt like \"well we are Tokyo joes so...\" There was an apology, and an offer to come back for the rice. Well I work a lot, when I buy something from a reputable place like most, I expect the item(s) to be received the way they are being offered.  I don't have the time to adjust my work schedule to get something you forgot. 

I would urge you to take a peek at your order before leaving. (I unfortunately had normal expectations which were not met) 

Tokyo Joe, or whoever looks at these reviews. Maybe encourage your team to offer a discount off the customers next order. 

I wouldn't be so annoyed if I didn't feel so abandoned after you messed up my order from your own menu. 

I would like to take this review down because I think businesses tend to get lazy and errors happen. 

I will continue to order from many other restaurants, and recommend other restaurants as I believe they value people individually, and their time."}
{"text":"Ordered the poke bowl with Traditional Hawaiian sauce. It was good, but I wish it weren't so spicy. My lips and mouth were on fire as I ate my meal. I didn't order or add anything to it that could've made it spicy so I had no idea where it was coming from so I brought it up to the workers and they told me it was probably coming from the sauce. I would have appreciated it so much if they at least had some type of notification/chili pepper sign or something to symbolize on their menu to warn customers of this fact."}
{"text":"Very good fresh food made to order! Lots of healthy choices and reasonably priced. They also have sushi which looked really good - will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Staff at Tokyo Joe's are amazing. 

My husband and I were here and enjoyed a quick and yummy lunch. Food was good and the service was better than most sit-down restaurants! 

We were rushing for our flight and left behind his IPhone. Shane, one of the employees of Tokyo Joe's not only mailed us back the phone, but mailed it back free of charge.

That is beyond good customer service, that is being a good person and then some. Thanks guys...you rock!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the bad reviews. I've gone here numerous times for take out and have never had a bad experience. I usually get the build your own bowls and the portions are filling, they have always been fresh and the sauces you can choose from I feel are very flavorful. Staff has always been respectful."}
{"text":"Just found out that they also have buy one get one free poke bowls every Monday after 4pm!!"}
{"text":"Hate to be a Debbie Downer but my experience was less than stellar... Joined their Addict club and got a two-piece rice spring roll with shrimp... You could barely see or taste the shrimp And the peanut sauce had a very off taste... After two dunks I slam dunked it away for me... had the bowl with my mahi mahi... The fish was way overcooked the sauce was nice but that's about it... Basically spent money for a bowl of rice... I don't know why casual or fast food establishments need to charge $2.59 for 12 ounce soda... I know soda is a high profit product but come on now $2.59? Yikes ... Wanted this to be an average or pleasant experience did not have either one..."}
{"text":"Visiting my cousin here in Tempe and we received a coupon for this place so we figured it was worth checking out. I definitely plan to come back in the future when I'm in the area again! Good, simple, delicious food and reasonably priced. 

I did the build your own bowl and am so happy with all the options and how packed the bowl was!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and it was take-out both times. The Bento box is super cool. U can create your own meal!  The bowls are great too. The regular size is plenty food!! You gotta stop by here and check it out sometime!"}
{"text":"The old Five Guys spot is now a Japanese place!

Classic Ramen: Ramen noodles were more cooked than I prefer and thicker too, almost the circumference of spaghetti noodles.  The broth was very plain chicken broth and lacked \"umami\" but the big spoonful (not an artful drizzle) of teriyaki sauce helped the broth once mixed in.  The chicken was fine, plain and not too dry.  I appreciated that they included a small whole egg in the price, though it's hard boiled.  Near the end of the bowl the sweetness was getting to me though.  2/5 for the weak broth (I wish they'd use shrimp, fish, or even pork broth instead of chicken), too much teriyaki sauce on top the chicken (try a drizzle next time), and overcooked noodles (they need a better chew).  $7.75.

Crab cheese won ton roll: My first impression was that these were very tiny, and the nori is wrapped around the crab mixture with rice then surrounding that.  However, the taste was definitely above the imitation crab used in grocery store sushi!  You actually taste the crab!  They actually had a good texture too, and the tiny bit of won ton strips on top helped add a bit of crunch that was nice.  Despite the smaller portion, this was really good.  4/5.  $4.50.

The music was meh (Little Richard, really?) but at a decent subtle volume.  It was beautiful weather on the patio, and I had a nice sunset view and great breeze, but it is still just a parking lot sidewalk seat.  I was not greeted or acknowledged right away, but the employees were friendly enough after that.  It's definitely chain food fare, but at least it's something different.  3/5 stars seems about right."}
{"text":"So my friend and I decided to go get lunch today. We decided on sushi and stumbled on this place. So we go inside, greeted right away and asked if we had any questions. The employees there, were super nice! I ordered a spicy tuna roll with edamame and my friend ordered a crab cheese wonton roll with edamame. We both agreed the edamame was great! Love that they had gluten free soy sauce also! Then we get our rolls. My spicy tuna roll, didn't taste like what a spicy tuna roll should have tasted. It had no spice to it, no sauce, and the tuna tasted funky. My friend's roll was way too sweet and had a funky taste to it too. We were extremely disappointed because we both love sushi and this place wasn't the best. Never again."}
{"text":"Courtney and all the people there alway rock. They put up with my wifes endless add ons and my weird alergies and bad sence of humor!!! Great food and they take it seriously. If you ask for a certian ingredient to be excluded in your food they ask if its an alergy or a preference.  If its an alergy they make it on a separate surface and they do it with a smile!! Great food, great beer, great people"}
{"text":"First off, this is a newer restaurant in the area, which we were not familiar with prior to this visit.

You have options of ordering specialty bowls, sushi, bento box or make-your-own-bowl (MYOB).  We chose MYOB.

Two large bowls with \"white\" chicken, two medium drinks and order of pot stickers cost us $30.  All the tables were dirty.  No napkin dispenser near the straws and chop stick area.  Napkins were held under tight control behind the counter.  Walked up to the front registers and asked if someone could wipe down the table.  Met with a response of  \"oh yeah, I forgot\".  Interestingly, the girl came over and wiped just our table, and ignored the other dirty tables.  Not a good sign of this joints' cleanliness or initiative to stay atop of the dining-in experience.

Our bowls arrived, then the potstickers. Why do places like to serve pieces in odd numbers, especially since people tend to share?  There were 5 potstickers at $4, and not worth it at all. Barely cooked with as little pan fry texture as possible.

The udon noodles in the bowls were gummy, slimy and gross.  Yes the veggies were fairly fresh (although the carrots tasted like frozen little orange squares), the overall bowl was not that good.  Something was off.  Red sauce (supposedly spicy) was somewhat thick.  First thought was that it has some sort of filler in it.  The \"white chicken\" were slices looked and tasted like pre-cooked pieces found at any fast food restaurant.  

The only positive was the variety of ice teas.

After spending that type of money for a fast food counter service is disappointing.  The meal sat in the stomach like a gummy ball.  Overall food was not flavorful, weird filler or thickening agent added and overcooked noodles.  Will not be visiting this place again.  Other fresher, local options than this chain."}
{"text":"Today I stopped in to Tokyo Joe's for lunch. I have to say this is probably the best Asian food I've had in a long time. The food was fresh chicken was cooked properly and the management was extremely helpful and great customer service. The restaurant has a nice aura and I will definitely be coming back. I can't wait till they expand across the valley so I can bring my girlfriend as well."}
{"text":"Currently dealing with a nasty case of food poisoning from here. I thought the crab meat in the California rolls tasted funky, now it all makes sense. My first couple times here were great, but unfortunately now, I won't be back. I would look into this to make sure nobody else gets sick."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Fast and delicious, perfect for a quick lunch. I got a rice bowl and it was amazing. I wish there were a lot more of these in the valley!"}
{"text":"Used to eat at TJ in CO and so glad we have one close in Scottsdale now.  Always great and friendly service.  Food is amazing.  Always fresh veggies and the chicken is superb.  Get the Spicy-Aki white chicken with water chestnuts, bean sprouts, sweet onions, and sugar snap peas.  Fantastic!!! We are addicted!!!"}
{"text":"I've been anxiously awaiting the poke bowl craze to hit the West side of town & finally it has. This little gem opened up last month & I finally made it & wasn't disappointed in the least. When I first moved out West this wasn't exactly a culinary oasis. However it's catching up a bit at least chain wise on the food options. Can't wait to get back & try another poke bowl option. Hubs had the bento box & liked it too. Pretty big portions of everything. Next time I'm gonna see if I can double up on my tuna because it was that good. Give this place a try if you're on the West Siiide. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I loved this place! It's a build-your-own concept for the most part, with lots of different rice and noodle combinations to choose from. I bought a rice bowl with lots of veggies, and peanut sauce. It was really good! Prices are fair- a little higher than a typical quick service, but very fair- you are getting a lot healthier ingredients and large portions."}
{"text":"It's ok. The sushi is basically a ball of rice with a little bit of fish. Obviously you get what you pay for! So don't expect quality in the sushi at least."}
{"text":"A quick place for lunch with way better than expected food.  Customized quick orders with lots of fresh tasting ingredients and flavors."}
{"text":"I will begin by give my the staff credit for being very friendly and inviting.  The food is just not that good. I ordered the salmon bento and the fish looked and tasted like it had been pressed into a foreman grill while still frozen. The kids were not impressed with their meals either.  The location is very clean and appealing but please visit a Yogi's grill and taste their menu to get an idea of what tastes good.  I really wanted to love this place because of the location."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise from this skeptic. Super friendly staff, very clean, calories and menu very easily understandable. Ordered steamed potstickers and spring rolls ... very crisp and fresh 

Will be back!



Update: I went back here the next day. Those spring rolls were so good!! It was a totally different experience. The guy double charged me. You can tell he knew it. I questioned but he repeated the order back. So I paid him. He didn't give me a receipt so I asked for one. He seemed nervous but I could be wrong. Then I pointed out the double charge. He needed help to change it which is fine but he knew the problem I feel. Also when I got the spring rolls they were cold and fresh but kinda a hot mess in the way they were put together ..The amazing sauce this time was all oil with no flavor - not as outgoing and put together staff as last night for sure. Disappointing. I'll try again but there are clearly some inconsistencies"}
{"text":"I like this place ! You can get an ahi bowl with spice! You can also order teriyaki bowls. The cost is around $10-$12 depending on what you get. The chicken bowl would be the cheapest. You can get made pretty healthy with veggies and me. Good place to go for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We were exited to have something new on this side of town and I was especially excited for a gluten free option. Online ordering didn't work. It took an extremely long time to get our food after my husband went in and ordered in person. (Maybe they forgot our order at first? Or maybe they made it but forgot to call our name? The lady was apologetic, which is why this has 2 stars instead of 1.) We ordered extra GF teriyaki Sauce and my husband finally got home with our dinners and there was extra Sauce but not the GF one. The sweet potatoes were undercooked and hard. The steak was dry. I do not recommend going here until they get the hang of things. I've heard other locations don't have these problems so maybe this is because they're new but they've lost our business."}
{"text":"Upon driving by the \"coming soon\" on my daily AJ's run, I looked up Tokyo Joe's and learned all about its rich Colorado history. A few months into my gluten avoidance, I welcomed the idea of a fresh Asian spot in the neighborhood. They've not quite been open a week and I've visited them three times, trying something new every time. The Gyoza is a delicious starter, the sushi rolls are great and the bowls, soups and salads offer a variety of flavors sure to never get boring. My husband ordered a green curry and his response was: Aside from the searing burn on my tongue, this is flavorless. I have personally enjoyed the General Joe's soup, MoJoe bowl and I've built my own. I'm sure to be a regular here."}
{"text":"The teriyaki sauce is amazing but their sushi sucks   Expensive but the bowls are filling."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with my husband for a quick lunch this week and was shocked at how great everything was. The service from the moment we walked in was amazing. The guy behind the counter was super great gave us suggestions and was very informative. Had the best customer service we've had in a while! 
We both had bowls I had mahi mahi and he had the mojo, mine was great and husbands was cooked perfect! We will definitely make it back here!"}
{"text":"My co-worker & I go a few times a month. The staff is very friendly & after a few months, recognize us as semi regulars. The best way to describe their food is \"Fast Japanese\" food. Don't expect high end sushi or cheap drive through teriyaki bowls. The food is decent for what it is. Great for lunch, but I wouldn't have a \"Date Night\" there. I usually get a Bento Box with Gyoza, Sumomono, Chicken Teriyaki, & California Roll. Sometimes I'll just get the Crab Cheese Wonton Roll & Miso Soup, YUM! I tried the Chicken Skewers once, but it had WAY too much peanut sauce on it to enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Tried the Veggie Roll for the first time, it was meh. Got a Build Your Own Protein Bowl with chicken. Was not a fan of the peanut sauce. I wish I tried it before putting it all over my food. My girlfriend's Tofu Spring Rolls were BOMB. Would definitely come back for those. The girl that took our order was nice and patient with us while we made up our minds. One small thing I did notice about the service: when we walked in one of the employees was eating at the front counter. After his meal he started walking around all over the dining room, refilling his drink while talking really loudly on his cell phone. I'm sure he was on his break, but it did throw me off a bit. Now that I think of it, it could have been two separate guys, which makes it more off-putting that they're just chilling all over the place like they're at home."}
{"text":"It's fresh but the green curry shrimp was really bland. My husband said his oyaka was just ok. Friendly service, clean, good location. Will try the sushi at some point."}
{"text":"Ok it gets 5 stars. Come on I eat here weekly. Great iced tea. Gluten-Free that never gets me ill. Love it! Tried the sushi today, gluten-free soy sauce. Gotta try more menu options like I did today. Having gluten-free teriyaki sauce has me stuck on rice bowls. Thanks for being great!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars bc even though I didn't like what I ordered, the staff was outstanding, especially the guy at the register. I was with my toddler who didn't like anything I ordered and to be honest, I didn't like it either. But I think if I ordered something else next time, it'd be much better! So why am I giving TJ 4 stars? Bc their customer service was exceptional. I never ask for a refund, but the kind guy gave me one. I felt so bad but I told him I'd come back again for sure and try something else. What he did, made my day!  He could've told me to get real n forget it. But he was so gracious about everything that I would gladly return and try something else! This is excellent business... not everyone should get this bc if you're rude or you're trying to scam a business for free food, then u deserve to be ousted. But for me, that was not the case. I would visit TJ again to try another dish... and all thanks to their one employee! So great job on hiring this guy, Tokyo Joe's! I'll see u guys soon for a second opinion! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place with amazing food you get to create and re-create yourself over and over again.  Enjoy the Buddha Beer!"}
{"text":"Are you into fitness? Eating healthy? Appropriate portions? Then this place is for you. I usually cook at home but on the days I don't I like to eat here. (besides cheat meals) I'm half Asian and know good Asian food, if this that is what you're looking for then this place may not be for you. If you're looking for a well balanced meal that tastes good for being healthy, then you should check this place out. The veggies have a great assortment, they're crunchy (which I love!), and the protein is always juicy, I had the perfect amount. I didn't finish all my noodles since i don't require that many carbs. Overall, I was very happy and I'm so glad they're close to my house so I can swing by after the gym!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience 
Food was super clean and not over sauced
Supersize your order for $2.00
Enjoyed the fact that the food was not over seasoned 
Will return for sure"}
{"text":"Expensive, not enough food, lots of carbs, a few pieces of low quality beef, no vegetables and taste awful. I am Asian and this FAKE Asian restaurant is an insult for any Asian food. Panda Express or Peiwei would not be my first choice for dinner, but at least they taste much better and better bang for your bucks. Would I come back again? Absolutely NOT!!!"}
{"text":"Here is a first for me as far as chain type restaurants are concerned. Tokyo Joe's is clean and friendly. The prices actually match what you receive. The food taste fresh and not over cooked. I went with the Udon noodles and chicken but here is the key: mix the sauces to take this simple bowl to an extraordinary level of flavor. Spicy & sweet is so neat! It's a nice spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I love eating teriyaki bowls with a mixed medley of vegetables. 

I ordered a chicken steak bowl with a variety of vegetables and added avocado paying extra. It was around 6pm so there were about 20 diners. The food took about 30 minutes, a little too long for my liking. When my bowl came out, the avocado was there but it was not ripe at all and it was as hard as rock! I didn't understand why something inedible was still placed in the bowl with the expectation that I was going to eat it. I mean it's pretty obvious that I don't have fangs. 
 
I alerted the cashier who told me to throw it away and he asked if I wanted something else like a drink. I just wanted my avocado refunded. A better way to handle the situation would have been to not put the avocado there and then ask if I wanted a refund or something else off the menu.

The rest of the food was tasty which is why they still get 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time at this location. We usually go to the location on McDowell. But we moved to surprise so happy we have one out here. Food is fresh and well prepared. This new location has a beautiful patio area to enjoy the AZ sunsets while enjoying dinner. Their menu is super simple. You can create your own bowls with choice of protein veggies rice and sauce. They also have sushi rolls. Prices are worth the quality of food. Manger walking around cleaning and chatting with his guests. Kids menu has a variety of things from custom bowls to Mac n cheese. Their chocolate chip cookies are bomb dot com! We enjoy it here. If your looking for fast healthy and affordable this is your place! This is a Big Bowl with dark chicken brown rice broccoli carrots and zucchini . See menu pictures for all the different choices. I must add restrooms are clean. They also use earth friendly napkins cups ect"}
{"text":"This opened across the street from where I work, so I go here from time to time. I've only had a few menu items so the star rating is lower for now, and will most likely change as I try more things. 

The stress here is fast, healthy food, not so much on authenticity, so if you want more authentic, traditional Japanese food, this isn't where you'll find it.

I like that it's a healthier option, as I am cleaning up my eating habits(bye McDonald's!). Good prices too, and I like that you can get half orders of their sushi if you're peckish but not starving(4 piece or 8 piece are their options). Prices are reasonable too. To Go orders are made quickly, and all food is made when you order it so it is hot and fresh. 

I've been eating the sushi, I haven't ordered a bowl yet. The Arizona roll is a bit bland. It has a LOT of heat, but not much flavor overall. I ordered it twice and both times I wished I had a salt shaker with me(I ordered it to go and took it back to work with me). The Crab Rangoon roll is good(my current go-to), just a little on the messy side. :P I've had the nigiri once and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't outstanding either. The rice is cooked well, with a good consistency. 

If you're a Coke fan you'll be disappointed, they serve Pepsi products here. They do have a decent selection of beer. Four Peaks fans will be happy, as they have 8th St. Ale and Peach Ale in their arsenal, and I believe I saw bottles of Kiltlifter the last time I was there. 

Customer service is great! They are friendly and polite, and I REALLY like that they are welcoming but are more low key, and less hyper cheerful(Chipotle, I'm looking at you). It's a very clean, quiet, chill place to eat, which makes it a great place to study or get some work done."}
{"text":"Very good food for this type of (fast food) place...  Healthy/fresh vegetables, teriyaki sauce, white rice..   But, the main reason for this review:  the manager (guy running the place)..  Very enthusiastic, friendly, and conscientious...  Terrific service...  Also, good music, free wi-fi, clean and plenty of space to get a little bit of work done...     (I was there for lunch on 4/23)"}
{"text":"So I ordered takeout, Joe's Lettuce Wraps and an 8 piece California Roll. Total for this was $19.40  See the picture of the \"Lettuce Wraps.\"  To me it looks like an unassembled chicken salad. Under the lettuce is cut up carrots and a quarter of avocado. I'm really not sure what the noodles are for. It comes with three \"dipping sauces.\" Between us, lets just call them salad dressings. 

So how was the California Roll? I have no idea, because when I got home I realized they never gave me it.  So i definitely feel ripped off. 

Like others I really wanted to like this place, but they gave me several reasons not to.  With many good Japanese restaurants in the area, I would not consider this one of them. Food is fine, prices rather high, service, well not good."}
{"text":"Tasteless. The spicy tuna roll was alright, but the rice tasted a little like cardboard. The yakitori bowl had no flavor. It literally tastes so bland it made me wonder of I had a cold. I wasn't expecting something awesome but when a McDonald's hamburger has more flavor, that's rather disappointing."}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's has become a regular go-to spot for take-out for my husband & I.  We moved here from So Cal & have been looking for a quick easy spot to get fast-food sushi & this is it!!! (We miss Fuji Grill in Newport Beach)

Their regular bowls have been great (we've tried white Chicken,  Steak & Salmon) We've also enjoyed the Tuna Tetaki Salad & a Specialty bowl with fish (maybe Mahi?) that had a mango salsa.. yum! I appreciate options to add veggies & opportunity to specify which veg rather than getting a predetermined mix.

We really enjoy their array of sauces too. They do not have many rolls but we have enjoyed each one we've tried. I recommend the Cali tetaki & the Arizona! Would love for them to create more specialty rolls.

Very clean. Fair prices for great quality. Staff is friendly & happy. A mistake was made on one of our orders which they rectified to my satisfaction without hesitation.

Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I reviewed a message from the manager, Dawn, less than 24 hours from my first visit apologizing about the situation. I think it's great when a manager can admit to faults and grow themselves and their team from mistakes. I was not expecting her to reach out to me or invite me to come back for a great experience. I understand that mistakes happen and they are all teachable moments, it just depends on the accountability and ownership and their actions to rectify moving forward. I have accepted her invitation to come back and look forward to the great experience she guarantees I will have."}
{"text":"Food is definitely healthier than your normal \"quick service\" type restaurants.  You order up in the front and they bring the food out to you.  I wasn't a huge fan of their teriyaki sauce but their cucumber salad was quite tasty.  Definitely a place worth giving a go."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tokyo Teriyaki Bowl and got gyoza. Both were really bad. My husband and I had one bite each and decided it wasn't worth the calories. Was our first time at a Tokyo Joes. Just not for us and we feel there are better options elsewhere. :-("}
{"text":"No way! Besides the service being very put off that I would order something;

Ordered poke bowl after hearing people rant and rave about this place.
1) Rice was dry/hard
2) Rice was cold
3) Tuna was meh.
4) No sides (Crab? Seaweed salad?)
5) Toppings are ok - pretty standard
6) Overall pretty small bowls comparatively to other places

Just overall - nothing that I would go back for."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and the menu looked great. My sushi was a bit bland. Would like to go back and try a bowl next time."}
{"text":"i would give less than one star but this app is bullshit. i was charged double for my order and the person taking my order was hitting on my friend then became aggressive when she was not interested. 0/10 experience. 

will probably come back tho tbh"}
{"text":"Food was average  however, I felt it was super overpriced and small portions. 

I got a regular size and a large size and they are in the same containers with the same portions. I got double protein and it didn't even seem like it. Would not return."}
{"text":"So good to see a Tokyo Joe's in Tempe today, I am a Colorado native where it started and ate at one several times a month, they definitely are very good and I felt like I was back home having lunch in Colorado. 

The downside, they've obviously turned corporate. Small portions and 10 bucks for a small portion of rice, some chicken, and sauce. Still the award winning taste, but bummer to see that. Good Luck and see you soon"}
{"text":"Surprisingly for T Joe's they really screwed up today, bad enough I came to yelp to talk about it. 

I ordered a white chicken teriyaki bowl with no vegetables, 1 small drink.  11.45 was the total

A noodle dish came out with salmon on it with a pink sauce. I told the guy I ordered a white chicken teriyaki bowl with no vegetables. 2nd try came out with ramen chicken and vegetables. I took it up and said this is totally wrong, can I just get my money back and I'll be on my way. They handed me a food voucher and said have a good day. I said I needed my money back, not a food voucher. So they told me to keep the voucher, and refunded back 6.85. It felt insulting at this point, this is what 4-5 fails now? I said the total was 11.45, so she refunds me back another 1.45 for a top veggie mix coming back to 9.01 because their manager card will not allow back the full refund and tells me sorry. So in final I paid 2.44 for a free cup of water.  

  They have great food when they get it right, but maybe try a different location, the staff had a unique way of making me feel bad for asking for my correct food & then worse for not eating their mistakes."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum..   This place is my new favorite.   Ate at a coupl of their locations and have never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Love Tokyo Joe's! Serving sizes are great! For the quality of food and amount you get, the prices are great. Bento boxes are awesome! We even love the options for the kid bento boxes! Awesome that they have so many tea options! Sushi is delicious! Everyone was really nice and helped us with the menu since it was our first time. If i had to knock anything it would be that one of our rolls were a little loose. Bottom line, don't skip this place! We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time today.  I placed my to go order in person(lettuce wraps & a bowl) at 11:30 it took them 30mins to make my order, I am not exaggerating, I walked out of the place at 12.  Sit down restaurants can get food out faster than that.  As I'm sitting here finishing my first lettuce wrap I look over to find all the other pieces of lettuce are filthy with clumps of dirt(see pics), not even remotely washed.  Needless to say I'm not going to finish this below average tasting dirty food.  I observed while waiting 30 mins for my food that the line cooks had approximately 10-15 orders backed up on the printer (see pics), and the cooks let them sit there for at least ten minutes.  Sometimes waiting is understandable when a place is just having a bad moment.  They were not any busier than any other comparable restaurant type for lunch hours.  Waiting 30 mins for dirty lettuce and my friend's over cooked steak bowl not worth it!"}
{"text":"Was good but a little bland. They give you the sauce to put on yourself. Though it would all be stir fried together with the sauce."}
{"text":"Just tried out this place! What do you mean the food is bland? Loved the noodles & the sauce! Sauce was spicy, sweet & flavorful, all at the same time. I thought the sauce was very original & am eager to try their other sauces, it was so good. This is also not a service restaurant, you get into line, put in your order, pay for it and they bring you the order.The dishes are only as creative as you make it - you can specify any of the ingredients to your taste. I don't like my sauces too spicy but that is what the sriracha is for; when it comes to spiciness, it's such an individual taste, you can always add it & make it as spicy as you want! I won't order a dish again if it's too spicy. The noodles were great!  Just right, not mushy or overcooked, just the right texture. This place is the best of the asian fast food casual places I've been to lately."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  The service is superb and the food is great.  I tend to get the same sushi everytime, I'm not that adventerous, but it's awesome.  I love having fast food sushi then waste money at a formal Sushi restaurant.    Anyway , ask for Edward.   Great young man,  who provides excellent service, cool accent too.

{"text":"The bowl I ate was delicious, the service good but it didn't agree with me unfortunately. Maybe something different next time."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  It is the Trifecta....Good (healthy food, Good service, Large Portions.
The place has a nice counter service vibe to it.  Spotlessly clean and the help is wonderful.
My only negative thought is the menu is a bit overwhelming at first.  But, you'll get the hang of it.  The Large bowls are huge and shareable.  I didn't have the sushi but it looked lovely and yummy.
Plus the location is great for moving onto shopping!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, they let you customize your bowls which I really like. Decent selection of sushi and good portions. Not as pricey as I thought. Overall a good experience with clean fresh food. I give them 4 teriyaki bowls"}
{"text":"Really nice people and the service was fast. You can tell everything is made fresh but it didn't take forever! Will definitely be going back for healthy lunches and dinners"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a healthy alternative.  I even liked the Sushi.  The only thing that I think they should do away with is the pea/carrot/lima combo they add to some of the bowls.  It really cheapens it."}
{"text":"I am honestly not quite sure how to rate the food because I didn't get to try it. A few days ago I walked in Tokyo Joes excited to try something new near my office! There was no line and as I walked up, I smiled and said hi to the gal behind the counter. She was stone cold and didn't even smile back, say hello, etc. So I said \"I've never been here before so I'll need a few minutes to look at menu\". AGAIN, this gal just stares blankly at me...no smile, no \"here try this or this is how our menu works, or I love this menu item\". That was enough for me to turn around and walk out. Customer service is a HUGE part of what brings people in restaurants ESPECIALLY with 42 places around with hefty competition! The food could be top notch but with bad people behind the counter your business will suffer! I may try to stop in again and hope the person behind the counter likes their job!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best place North Scottsdale for clean, healthy eating! The staff is phenomenal and the place is spotless. Mike Smith runs a flawless operation. I've had it with my staff about 25 times since opening and we all unanimously agree it's the best, nicest place in North Scottsdale by a long shot. Thank you guys! You are the best! Appreciate the tremendous effort and impeccable service!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are way too small, you can get a better deal at Pei wei or any other place with much bigger rolls."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Tokyo's Joe's and I have to say I am pleased with the service I got. The restaurant was clean. Brittany and Shane walked me thru the menu and didn't seem to be bothered with all the questions I had. They were so patient with me. The food was great! The atmosphere was pleasant. I will definitely be eating here again. I just want to say thank you to Brittany and Shane keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"So far I really like this place. The green curry is great. .  I also love the spring rolls with peanut sauce.  My kids liked the sushi they ordered and my grand son loved the kids teriyaki  chicken and noodles.  Dessert sushi was pretty good also. The price are not to bad.  The only thing I would change is the peanut skewers would have been better if they were grilled.   they appear steamed. We will be back to try more. One thing that would be great is curbside del for take out.  I get most of my orders to go. they don't have a place just to pick up take out.  I feel like I have to wait in line to get my order."}
{"text":"Great food at a great value! The bowls are awesome and making your own is even that much better! Highly recommend going by for lunch!!"}
{"text":"My co workers and I decided to try Tokyo Joe's today for lunch. Although they were busy, the line moved fast. We got our to-go orders in a timely manner. However, once we got back to our office and inspected our food, we were unhappy. 
1 of my co workers order a chicken teriyaki bowl with 5 veggies. She was disappointed that not all the veggies order were included. 
My other co worker order a Yakitori bowl with spicy-aki sauce. Her noodles were dry and was missing any kind of sauce. She got plain noodles. 
I order a poke bowl with light onions and instead got extra onions. 
The food was good but it was like no one made sure they were delivering what the customer ordered. 
It was disappointing."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place. The cashier was very friendly! I explained it was my first time so she was patient with me. No line behind me which was great for a Friday mid day. I sampled the \"spicy\" sauce and it was good but no heat like most places I've eaten at that say spicy. LUCKILY they had hotter options which most places don't offer. That was a huge win for me! I looove burn your mouth hot. The habanero was perfect!!! I love that you can build your own bowl. I was able to choose my own veggies which was a hit! The traditional same veggies can get old and basic. The only small issue I had was the things that weren't covered in a sauce weren't very seasoned...if at all. So it makes me iffy on trying anything without smothering it in sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I just made a bowl with grilled stake, brown rice and asparagus. Great place for a healthy meal :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided that we were going to try out Tokyo Joe's as we've both been eating low carb and this look like a fun new option. Tokyo Joe's has parking in the front in the back with their main entrance being on the Main Street of Bell Road we parked in the back not realizing that the entrance in the parking lot was not the main entrance so when walking in we had to walk through a tiny aisle with people eating. It was a weird setup from the get-go once we made it up to the front to place our order we stood in line for quite a while behind a man talking to an employee prepping food behind the counter. I automatically assumed the man in front of us was a customer turns out that he was an employee off-duty just shooting the breeze. Once he noticed that we were waiting in line he let us know that he wasn't in line so we were able to move up but it was still a long wait. There were only two people in front of us in line with two cashiers and it still took forever just for us to place our order. When it was finally our turn the cashier was not friendly at all she didn't even greet us asked us if we had been in or if we had any questions about the menu, she pretty much just stood there with a Blank Stare on her face. We already had known what we wanted so we placed our order quickly paid and proceeded to wait for our food. Once our name was called we headed out to the car, we noticed right away that we were given the wrong order so back inside we went. They had her food waiting as we didn't make it very far and were able to give the food we had to the correct customer. Once we got home we were quickly disappointed with our decision to go to Tokyo Joe's. My husband ordered a steak Bowl which was a 8.35... it was a small piece of dry steak and a side of sauce, since he opted for the low carb version he was charged an extra 1.50 for a single serving of undercooked/unseasoned veggies. I went with the chicken bowl which was $6.35 for chicken and a side of sauce plus a dollar fifty extra for the single serving veggies. We were completely disappointed and will not be returning. Bad experience all around."}
{"text":"Was driving by and figured I'd stop by and try this new place. Very clean establishment. I ended up ordering a Arizona Roll and Texas Roll, they didn't really have a lot of sushi selection as I expected. Both the Arizona Roll and Texas Roll were pretty bland. Not much flavor to it and there wasn't really any meat in Texas Roll. I didn't think it was worth the price of $7.50. I would of given it a 3 star for the food, but it took a long time to get the food as well and there wasn't anyone in there. Maybe I'll give it a try one more time in the future and update the review at that time."}
{"text":"I don't give out too many 5 stars, but Tokyo Joe's deserve it. Very delicious. Every item I tasted was delicious. Very fresh food, flavorful, and healthy. Also, prices are reasonable especially when considering the quality. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Food was very disappointing. We paid online and you just walk in and take it no one helps you missed a bag had to go back just stupid someone should be checking was is being picked up"}
{"text":"The service was great! Food is even better. Try the Arizona sushi roll if you like sushi with a kick!"}
{"text":"**EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

I have gone to this location multiple times and had good service, however last saturday was a disaster.

I ordered a teriyaki bowl, 4pc of the crab cheese wonton rolls and got free spring rolls from my loyalty card. seemed fine except the food gave me SEVERE FOOD POISONING. The most probable culprit being the sushi. anyway spent my whole Sunday at the ER due to the food poisoning and spent my 4th of July in bed recuperating.

so my $16 meal ended up costing me $700+ in hospital bills, thanks joe's!!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's is really good! I got the build your own protein bowl with salmon, rice and veggies. It was so good! I would recommend this place to anyone who likes fresh food and likes healthier options."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty asian fair. Ate here twice and enjoyed it each time. Will be back whenever I have a taste for noodles or a rice bowl."}
{"text":"New to Arizona, & I found a gem of a place. 
Fresh, hot and amazingly great food. I had a poke bowl and OMG delish!!! I've pinned this on my favorite list and will be a frequent customer!
Great job, Tokyo Joes"}
{"text":"This is a great option for quick and healthy Asian food. It was pretty quiet on a Sunday evening. I got the large build your own bowl with dark chicken and brown rice/ ramen noodle combo with the 5 veggies special.  I got full pretty quickly and had enough for a bowl for later! !"}
{"text":"Used to eat here all the time. Beef and chicken bowls, California rolls and occasional salad.  My last visit, halfway eating down my beef bowl
I was greeted by a cockroach. Never going back."}
{"text":"They had some good specials, but the sushi wasn't that great. Came on Valentine's Day, so it was expected that it was busy. A bit crowded due to it being a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Healthy options that are fresh and tasty. I've had a few menu items and I am partial to the poke bowls. Great flavors and all the ingredients seem of high quality. As far as eating at the restaurant, I could take it or leave it. It's counter order and I am really there for the food! There's a BOGO special on Mondays for sushi menu items . Sign up for their rewards program and they'll give you a free starter just for signing up. Also, they offer meal programs that I haven't tried yet, but it looks interesting if you have the extra money and are dedicated to training or dieting."}
{"text":"This place was bomb!!! Very clean, food was very good and healthy and good costumer service. Would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"From Ca. And went to find a place to eat. This place was good. Service was greatI will go back and try other things on menu .."}
{"text":"Service we so awesome, the guy who took my order was super friendly and the order came out REALLY fast!! I did takeout and was in a hurry, I sat at a table to wait for it and the host who took my order brought my order to me from around the counter rather than just calling me to the front to come get it, which I thought was a really nice touch. Then the food itself was really delicious, and seemed really healthy and not greasy at all - I got the chicken teriyaki with veggies and brown rice, it was very tasty."}
{"text":"This place rocks my world every time. The options are virtually limitless and I love that you can get a poke bowl AND sushi. Every item is totally fresh and delicious, and the staff is fast and friendly. I was there a few weeks ago and this older lady was commenting on how cool the soy sauce bottles were. An employee offered to give her one and the lady was just so happy. Super glad to have a place like this in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I kind of love this place; the only reason they lose a star is the california roll is just \"meh\" quality and they really ought to upgrade their gf soy sauce packet brand.

I got a white chicken bento with california roll, edamame, and gluten free teriyaki sauce. All in all very pleased with the flavor of both the sauce and the chicken, and the rice was properly cooked. The GF teriyaki was flavorful and a great texture. I thought the edamame could have used a little more cooking time but they were done albeit al dente. I ordered my bento to-go and was pleased to find that they serve the sauce in a separate cup, leading to non-soggy food and more than enough sauce for my meal. 

The restaurant itself is super clean and has a pretty cool looking decor. The drink area is hidden around a corner, making the place look much classier. They serve an array of beers even some common Japanese beer brands. 

It's hard to find a place that serves gluten free options like this, and I will totally be going back to try more."}
{"text":"Cool concept for a Tokyo bowl fast casual restaurant. Kind of like a chipotle where you can create your own bowl and pick your protein, carbs (rice or noodles), a variety of veggies, and sauce. They also have sushi and poke too. Everything is made to order so it does take a bit to make your food and get it. So if you are here on a lunch break, make sure you get 45mins to an hour. They do have online and app ordering to save you time. Large portion sizes too for a pretty decent price. The regular size bowl had me full for quite a while. Almost went with the large but it would have been too much."}
{"text":"Really stingy on the fish compared to a lot of other places.  Normally the fish is cool and refreshing and this wasn't at all!!  I asked for tuna, avocado (a $1 extra) , fried wontons and edamame.   There is hardly any avocado in my bowl which I paid extra for!  I didn't ask for anything spicy and yet it's spicy so that makes me think they put the wrong sauce in.  

Definitely won't be coming back!!  There are places that'll give you way better and more fish for less than $14.  Waste of my money honestly."}
{"text":"Portion sizes seem to differ if you're eating or eating out. Received my big bowl to go which was half empty after letting the cashier know he stated that's the normal amount. Without any sauce the food is bland, almost as if it wasn't seasoned at all just cooked and thrown on a bed of rice"}
{"text":"The freshest, tastiest, and healthiest salads, sushi, vegetable bowls, and soups I've tasted.   Did I mention their wide selection  of teas and other refreshing drinks?   The restaurant is clean, bright,  and well managed by cordial staff headed by always cheerful manager Louis. I highly recommend Tokyo Joe's!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great food, clean/healthy, and some of the best customer service I have seen! They do meal prep for the health nuts and they got great and savory dishes too!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Healthy, unlimited combos and can order to reheat  for next 2-3 days. Online ordering was easy, accurate and ready to pick up at promised time. I recently ordered 3 custom bowls and the pan fried potstickers. All were delicious! Ordered all sauces on side and used about 1/3 of each. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has good food but the people are rude. On more than two occasions I went to go get food and they had closed 15 minutes early and refused to let me and another couple that was trying to get food into the restaurant. Wouldn't recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Yuck!! I ordered the Tokyo Original Bowl with white chicken.  No, it wasn't white chicken and it tasted bad, not very flavorful.  My husband ordered the Mahi Mahi.  It was as thin as a piece of paper.  The prices were terrible.  We won't be going back.  ."}
{"text":"I had the build your own bowl option; White Chicken, Brown rice, Spicy stevi yaki, broccoli, zucchini, carrots, edamame beans, Snap Peas. It very delicious and I will definitely come back  stop by for lunch more often."}
{"text":"I should have known by the name of this place that it was going to be as close to Japanese food as Panda Express is to Chinese food. 

I tried the Bento Box with teriyaki chicken, California roll and cucumber salad.  They must really like sesame seeds here.  Sesame seeds on the rice.  Sesame seeds on the roll. Sesame seeds on the cucumber salad.  Why?!?

I don't think I will be coming back here because I don't see the value of another $14 meal that was mediocre (including drink).  Guess the search continues for a quick service Japanese place."}
{"text":"First of all, whoever complained below about it being expensive obviously doesn't eat sushi very often! The rolls are around $8, bowls around $8-$11 and they are good sized. Yes, is it like a \"fast food\" type place? Sure it is but the sushi rolls (poke roll and yo roll) were very fresh and the ramen bowl was pretty good. We had to add some salt to it and ask for little bowls for the sushi,  but it overall, it was pretty good. I'd definitely eat here again. :)"}
{"text":"I love the food here however today at lunch they seem very overwhelmed. I have been waiting over 15 minutes for my food which eats up most of my lunch break"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's is a fairly decent Asian fusion restaurant. They make fresh sushi and offer a variety of menu items. The even serve beer.

The ambiance is modern and hip, and the prices are fair. This may or may not be close to authentic Asian food, but it doesn't matter to me - it's close enough.

I enjoy the ramen bowls, gyoza, and other noodle dishes. The staff at this location is friendly and the place is clean. I've never had the sushi here so I can't vouch for that.

I would recommend this establishment to family and friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now and I really wanted to like this place but I have yet to find anything great about it other than it's a healthy option.  The bowls are over loaded with rice or noodles they charge 1.30 each to add a 2oz serving of vegetables and the sauces just have a very weird flavor I can't explain.  The staff was semi friendly. I have to say I don't think I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and flavors. I'm committed to the ahi poke bowl and mix and match different items each time, but the other menu items that others with me have ordered look good as well. 

This place can have a line at times but it moves fairly well. Online ordering is easy and the pick up area makes it a breeze. Love the Addict Club (loyalty program) as well.

It's definitely in the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I've been there four times for lunch with coworkers. Good food, good service. The poke bowl is great, very fresh salmon."}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's has been a favorite of mine recently! I really love the build your own bowls and the spring rolls are sooooooooo tasty. 

The bowls let you customize everything from choice of rice, choice of meat, to choice of a bunch of different vegetables and sauces. They even have a few add on's for extra money such as avocado and egg, which are worth it in my opinion. 

But for real, I have to address the spring rolls. I always get it with chicken and it comes with cucumber, and bunch of carrots, avocado, all wrapped In a thin rice paper and served with a warm peanut sauce. The peanut sauce is so bomb and makes these rolls to die for. 10/10 would for sure recommend. 

Great place to stop in real quick for a bite or take to go!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat. It's quick and delicious! Prior to Tokyo Joe's opening, I was a regular at Yogi's Grill and let me tell you.... This place puts Yogi's to shame. Like Yogis, you can build a bowl with white chicken, dark chicken, steak, salmon or tofu.  You can choose white rice, brown rice or noodles.  That is where the similarities end. At Yogi's, you can choose teriyaki or spicy teriyaki sauces while at Joe's you can choose from like 8 different sauces. I have had two different ones. The Yakitori sauce is a spicy peanut sauce and is super good. My favorite is the Dragon sauce which is a lil hotter and less sweet than the Yakitori. They claim that the Dragon sauce is made with Habanero peppers which may be true, but it is not Habanero hot. While not as spicy as I was expecting, this sauce is delicious!  When building your own bowl you get to choose which veggies you want in it. The veggies are always fresh and crisp as they are placed in the bowl last. This place also offers many different kinds of sushi. I do not eat sushi so I will not comment on that but the rice or noodle bowls are great. Highly recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ok now I have to give this place two stars and it's not anybody's fault, not even the chef. I had the Joe's teriyaki Chicken Bowl, spring rolls, and this salmon/tuna hybrid roll that was just lovely.

The staff was attentive and polite and professional.

The food, well.... ok

The Good

It's obviously fresh.
The quality, I guess you could say, was very high. I likes the spring rolls. Honestly nothing wrong with them. And I like the salmon/tuna roll.

The bad

Honestly it was the teriyaki bowl and not for any reason you'd assume. When I first tried it I couldn't put my finger on it. It tasted bland, or plain. It was absolutely boring. It tasted TOO clean. Sterile even.  But there was nothing wrong with it all. It did taste like Panda Express but even more so.

It wasn't till the drive home that I figured it out. What makes food real good is the mixing of flavors. And example is putting salt on a steak before you cook, or waiting to put it in after just before you eat. Two totally different experience. The food at Tokyo Joe's is exactly like that. It's layered on top of each other and not actually cooked together. That's why the spring roll and the salmon/tuna roll tasted good and teriyaki bowl was boring. It's not the staff fault either. This is obviously how they are instructed to prepare this dull food. So if you want to pay high price for less the mediocre food. Look no further then here."}
{"text":"Great concept, but way over priced even on a The buy one get one free nights. All just rice and a few small pieces of meat to save $. Won't be going back. Place is a rip off. Sorry."}
{"text":"Tried this place today after some co-workers recommended it. The food was amazing, service impeccable, and the store was sparkling clean. I think I have found my new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"THE WORST \"Asian\" food I've eaten. Save yourself a few dollars and go to Panda Express. Even that is better. The \"steak\" was dry and crumbly. The vegetables were the equivalent of coming out of a frozen veggie mix bag and microwaved. The teriyaki sauce made me gag. The smell of the entire meal made me nauseous."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If u want to enjoy a true healthy eat with good protein and fresh veggies this is the place. I had a chicken green curry bowl with fresh veggies after a good workout. The service is great very attentive and courteous. They also have a menu for kids, my son loved his teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies. They have a nice selection of teas, I had the hibiscus tea. They have sushi as well, delish! Def going back soon."}

Despite reasonable freshness of veg, chicken seemed processed and plastic-like. Sushi rolls mushy and bland. Bizarre sauce given to doll over yakatori bowl.."}
{"text":"I know it says \"made to order\" sushi but I swear mine must have been sitting out. I stopped by for a quick lunch to go but even Fry's on Southern & Mill has better stuff than this place. The customer service was about average (my order was right sooo), my food was out quick but the sushi was nothing special."}
{"text":"Good, fresh Asian-inspired food ordered Chipotle-style: you choose your protein, the sauce, the starch (white or brown rice, or noodles), and the veggies. Or you can order one of their signature bowls, which I did; I had the MoJOE which was a good amount of food consisting of dark-meat chicken and veggies with a spicy sweet-sour sauce, and I chose white rice for the starch. It was tasty and satisfying. The place is nicely decorated with a modern Asian theme, well-lit, spacious and clean, service is fast and friendly, and free WiFi is available."}
{"text":"Cute place with a lot of healthy options. Tried the build your own bowl. Selected white meat chicken, miso sauce on side, brown rice and the no brainier veggie mix. Broccoli, edamame, carrots, zucchini, snap peas. 
Several different proteins and sauces to chose from. Along with many other veggies. Nicely served. Veggies done right. Good tasting miso. 
Along with bowls they have a small assortment of  sushi n rolls. Also ordered a 4 PC YO roll.  Salmon, ahi tuna, mango and avocado. Came with ginger n wasabi.  
The roll slightly disappointed. Thus the 4 star. Very Small. (4pc) Not very flavorful. But that doesn't take away from the bowl! Looked at several other plates and they looked yummy. Service was good and manager Lewis was fully present cleaning and serving and checking on customer satisfaction. That's a great sign of a well run place."}
{"text":"Service was alright, wished the food portion was a little more. Enjoyed the teriyaki vegetable bowl was just good. Not sure if anyone has any recommendations of what there best option on there menu is, will go back to try out a recommendation."}
{"text":"Loved it! The food here leans toward the healthy side with their fresh variety of vegetables. They are also following the build your own trend which is a great amenity to have. Service was great and food was good quality. Not having been here before I was pleasantly surprised as I was expecting basic boring rice and noodle dishes that I usually get at other Asian restaurants but that's not the case here."}
{"text":"Always fresh. Excellent quality and taste. Good menu selection. Best fast Japanese food in market. Only criticism is staff is a bit slow in keeping tables cleaned. Had to sit at counter while numerous empty tables sat with trash on them and staff did not seem to care."}
{"text":"I tried Tokyo Joe's out for the first time tonight and I absolutely love it! The cashier was great! He helped recommend a few options; he even offered to put the sauce on the side so I can try different varieties. I love grilled chicken/fresh veggies/brown rice and this place does it right! I will be coming back more often to try more menu items."}
{"text":"First time at this one. It took a bit of map help to find, but worth it. Yummy food at a decent price. I usually get regular bowl with brown rice and change the protein, veggies, and sauce each time! Everything is fresh and satisfying! I like the curry or the teriyaki sauce. Very nice staff!"}
{"text":"We Love Tokyo Joes!!! It's actually quite funny how we first started going here... We used to go to Yogis on Chandler/Kyrene, when on one Sunday we were on our way there to get lunch we saw that they were closed on Sundays. So we Google teriyaki chicken nearby and Tokyo Joe's popped up. We thought what the heck it's close by and open and we were craving our weekly teriyaki chicken. All I can say is we have been raving about Tokyo Joe's since our first visit. My husband continues to go there for lunch during work every single day and we go on the weekends. 

Not that there was anything wrong with Yogis but Tokyo Joe's is extremely fresh! You can tell everything is cooked when you order it, and the vegetables are like straight from the garden not the typical frozen cabbage medley you get other teriyaki chicken places. 

Unfortunately we have not tried anything else except the teriyaki chicken because it's that dang good and that fresh! And they have numerous veggies that you can choose from such as edamame beans, fresh jalapeños ( my favorite), Green onions, avocado, spinach, etc. i'm really not kidding when I say we eat there five or six days out of the week! 

Oh and if you have kids they have a great little kids menu. My daughter likes the peanut butter and jelly \"sushi roll \"!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now this week. I really like it. Healthy and tasty! I hope it sticks around!"}
{"text":"Came in today for a quick lunch with my husband and we really liked it. I got the bento box with teriyaki chicken and he got the ramen bowl with their pork broth. We both want to come back and try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"Picture this. It's 2 pm, and you've been at the Waste Management Open since 7 am. Look down. Your feet hurt. Look up. It's past high noon and you're getting hangry. Look back down. It's a large and colorful Mahi Mahi bowl. You're welcome.

In the few minutes before I scarfed it all down, I remember thinking that the sauces drizzled all over the rice and fish worked really well together with the mango, pineapple, and red bell pepper. I did feel however that the Mahi Mahi was a little on the dry side. And for the size of the large size bowl, I thought there should have been a little more of it -- what initially seemed like a massive bowl turned out to be largely filled with rice (pretty good rice, but still just rice).

Also, my friend got the large surf and turf bowl to go, but it turned out to be wayyy smaller than my dine-in bowl. So take that into account if you're hungry.

That said, it definitely hit the spot at my most desperate hour when I really had a spot that needed hitting. I'll definitely be back to try the poke!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and decided to try it out with my mom for the first time. I told her I'd heard great reviews so we both went in with high expectations. I'm not sure if other locations prepare their food differently, but at this location it just was not what I expected. Water from the fountain machine tastes awful...(but I wasn't charged for it so I guess that's a risk you take). Chicken was decent, sauce was fine, but the veggies were so awful. I'm not sure how to describe the taste. Perhaps freezer burned with a metal like after taste that ruined the whole dish. Sadly disappointed and wouldn't want to dine here again."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to try it out since I was craving something somewhat healthy. I ordered the bento box for about $10-11 and honestly wish I went elsewhere. The food was okay, edible. The salmon tasted like it came out of a bag  pretty disappointed. Edamame was actually good and came in good amount. Sushi here is somewhat acceptable. For that price, go to Sushi Ave or masa sushi, or even RA for that matter. The bento boxes are much better and they put more food in it. You won't be hungry like me and had to go somewhere else after to satiate my hunger."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Vegan n vegetarian friendly! Staff is very friendly and helpful! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joes is pure excellence in quality, service, and healthy meal options. 

My other half and I have been frequenting Joe's since we lived in Colorado (where it all began), and I have to admit, they have never disappointed. 

They provide more than you would expect too. There is sushi, deserts, and bottle beer options. Along with an added bonus that it's all completely and utterly affordable. Keep it up Joes, we'll be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"I always receive great customer service and the food comes out within 3 to 4 minutes. Even during lunches rush hour you get in and out quickly. I would definitely say to check this spot out."}
{"text":"Eh, I'm so bummed to say it, but I wasn't a big fan of Tokyo Joe's! I LOVE Japanese food and am a regular at Tokyo Express and Yoshi's but was super excited to try something new! 

First, the young man at the register was VERY nice and helpful when I was unsure about what to order so this review has nothing to do with the service, strictly the food itself. 

I ordered a bento box with chicken, veggies, rice, and a california roll. For the sauce, I chose the Yakitori which is a spicy chili -peanut sauce. It was quite flavorful but pretty thick and you can tell, packed with sugar. The veggies seemed like they had been frozen and were mushy, rice was well, you can't really mess up rice, chicken was ok but absolutely nothing special, and the California Roll was fishy and disgusting - not even edible. The portion size was also not very impressive for the price you pay.

I was the only one ordering at 2 PM (late lunch!) and it took about 10 minutes or so to get my food. For a quick place where most items seem pre-prepped, this seemed like a long time to wait in an empty fast-food restaurant! The entire meal with NO drink was over $10. All in all, i'll probably stick to my regular spots, but i'm glad I at least gave it a shot!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joes always gives you great service. I think the manager Andrew does a great job by leading by example. Always answering questions and giving  suggestions. I go there at least once a week and the food is always on point. They have a meal prep system now that they do which I'm highly looking into and recommend."}
{"text":"Tried my 1st bowl there today - takeout.  It was ok.  your typical chicken, noodles, veggie bowl.  The flavor was not there that I expected and I really wanted to like this place because I am desperately looking for a good healthy place like this.  Maybe i'll try the brown rice next time because the noodles were not that great."}
{"text":"Average in everyway.
Place is clean and has nice open deco (thr glasses window help) compares to typical joint like this. Prob the nicest thing out of the whole experience.

Food was meh. Didnt like the fact that they didnt cook the vegetable before dumping them to the bowl. Not something you expect when eating a teriyaki bowl. 

Price is reasonable but in my personal opinion a bit expensive considering they dont bother cooking the vegetables and I can whip something better myself and I don't even cook that much."}
{"text":"Came in with my friend and her two children. We ordered a lot of food because we wanted to try everything. 

Food came out quickly and was delicious! A great place for a quick lunch! 

We will definitely be revisiting Tokyo Joes, especially after they get beer!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a fluke just driving by. Tried it out for lunch yesterday. My kids got the California rollls and Miso soup and ate every bite. I ordered the Mahi bowl with udon noodles and  loved it! Hubby got the teriyaki bento and liked it- but the salad had no dressing so was a little dry and he didn't finish it. So many good options on the menu though so we will be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated with high calorie low nutrition fast food options.

The feel of the resturant was a very modern take with a traditional japanese twist. It was very inviting and relaxing. Big thumbs up on atmosphere. 

The place is designed to provide healthy, low calorie options. My wife ordered tofu with double vegetables instead of rice or noodles with a green curry sauce.  Has a sample, very tasty and fresh. I had the 8 piece spicy tuna roll and an order of cucumber salad. For the $1 the salad cost I was pleasantly suprised at the size and quality,  photo included. The roll was very good, on par with any standard sushi resturant. There are about 8 options on sushi so not bad for a \"fast food\" style resturant. 

A big perk was they offered 5 types of iced teas to choose from. I love tea and feel like most resturant offer it as a side thought to the cokes so big plus in my book. 

I am giving this place a solid 5 stars and will definatly return in the future. For less than $10 I got a cucumber salad, really tasty tuna roll and drink. Thank you for giving me an option to do healthy in a hurry Tokyo Joes."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Tokyo Joe's. I am not a Sushi/ Poke fan but the friends I go with love it and they say it's really good! I personally order a double dark-meat chicken bowl with rice noodles and Water-chestnuts with Spicy-aki sauce! Trust me you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Frustrated over poor service at Tokyo Joe's.  My wife and I love the food at this location but service from employees has taken a turn for the worse over last two visits.  I will give it one more chance next month.  This time we waited 20 minutes before wife got up from seat and asked for our tray of food that we watched sit for at least 5 minutes.  Cashier was very rude to her.

Good food only goes so far."}
{"text":"Always pretty good. But their employees are inexperienced. Cashier couldnt figure out how to add water chestnuts to a custom bowl. I couldnt understand why we werent allowed to modify a custom bowl. So had to pay 3 dollars extra for a side of water chestnuts in a seperate bowl. 

Also cashier said we couldnt substitute noodles for rice.... When the sign says CHOOSE your carb."}
{"text":"The food is great. The staff is friendly. Inside is clean. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Pei Wei concept!
Same taste and similar menu!
I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of MSG in their sauces. I'm not sure I would be back anytime soon but it was better than that I thought it would be and I have to say all these new concepts with bowls, sushi and salads is a trend that's going to continue."}
{"text":"Great bowls! They have preset ones or best of all- you pick all the items. You choose a protein (they have great tofu), rice or noodles, as many kinds of veggies you want, & sauce. I got a small & it was pretty big. I was very happy with my food.

You order at the counter but they bring you the food when it's ready. They bring your napkins, but wouldn't it be easier to have a dispenser so they don't have to make an extra trip when you ask for extra? 

The had 4 different kind kinds of unsweetened iced tea. I tried 2 & they were delicious!"}
{"text":"I really like these restaurants. The GF options are plentiful, and the food is very good. The service could be friendlier, unfortunately that seems to be the norm."}
{"text":"Sadly this was almost as bad as my Jr Prom, maybe because I was hungry and my expectations were high... none the less the location was a sad experience. Once again like my Jr Prom, location was great, looked great, but the main course was mediocre at best, (Not their fault, I didn't see a single asian in the kitchen). The girl behind the counter acted like an entitled snowflake that needed her safe space when I told her my name was Godzilla. No this isn't a smart ass remark because it's an asian restaurant. I literally use Godzilla as my nick name everywhere!!! (Starbucks, Dutch bros, paradise valley burger co, etc.) 

\"Can I have your legal name\" -_-... how about you just put what I tell you.... no one bats an eye when the name is \"Diamond, or Bentley\" but I can't use my own nickname?!

Next up on the \"disappointed like my mother is of me\"
The app doesn't work, why? Because they have more options on the app then they do in store. Supposed to be able to get $5.00 off when you use the app and insert \"firsttime\" (like my Jr prom ;) ). I can't believe I spent retail on mediocre food, save your money, go to McDonald's and know you're going to be disappointed."}
{"text":"After hearing mixed reviews I decided to try it. I got a salad with seared ahi tuna. The dressing was pretty good as well as the tuna. I would like to however had more tuna and Avocado , there were only three or four slices which was under whelming. I would go back and try something else."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday Night around 7:20. 
We chose an Adult Bento Box with curry, California roll, brown rice and edamame. 
We also had two kids meals. Teriyaki sauce, noodles, edamame and a cookie. 
All was yummy and fresh. The kids cookies were amazing. 

Although the portions are small (don't share like I did with the hubby!) the food is super fresh and really tasty. And the service adequate. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We discovered it about six months ago and can't get enough of it. The staff is always so nice. They always go above and beyond. Tonight I ordered the Green Curry Shrimp wanted to try something new. Unfortunately it was way too spicy for me. After just a few bites I couldn't take another. I was too embarrassed to tell them. My husband talk to somebody and they remade it for me with teriyaki sauce no problem. They are always so accommodating. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I love eating here lots of healthy but very tasty options! I have an extremely picky 12 year old who never turns it down.  We usually spend  $37 dollars for a family of 3 but  with leftovers for later. The tea they serve is very good quality. I personally look forward to their organic raspberry hibiscus!   Staff is very fast and courteous."}
{"text":"The food was not so good. Ordered 3 bowls. They were very bland. Noodles were way over cooked. I am also guessing the employees are not happy there. Not a single polite greeting or smile from the ladies taking the orders the whole time I was there (sat near register). For that matter, no employee cracked a smile except for one server.  I think one of the ladies at the register was the manager. Instead of a greeting, they just ask what you want. No \"hello\" or \"thank you's\", no nothin."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner & loved it. The service was excellent. My aunt & I both got bento boxes- really yummy & just the right amount of food. The sushi is pretty good for Arizona too!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. The food is so fresh. The veggies are never cooked which adds a whole level of deliciousness. Its clean and the service is so friendly. I just can't say enough about it. And the best part is that it is very affordable."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here because she is a sushi fanatic and I am not a fan at all. We were the only people in the place so took our time ordering since she had never been there before. 
My chicken teriyaki bowl was awesome but her sushi took forever to come out, 10+ mins after my chicken arrived, and looked old. I could tell by the look on her face when she tried it that it was a no go. I was so disappointed as not only was the place my suggestion, but my food was so good!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Tokyo Joe's! They made things right after a most unpleasant cashier experience. I'm glad to see that the company is run by people who are smart enough to care about their customers dining experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty and the employees are completely unprofessional and lazy.employees are cussing in front of customers. Just a bad place.   Had to return my sushi rolls because of hair in it and the cook was visibly upset and denying it was his hair even though he has a lot of hair.  Gross restaurant  and employees"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the menu seemed slightly overwhelming but the cashier was super friendly and helped me narrow it down. 

The reason for the 5 stars is the manager (I think) was in the BEST mood! I came in at 8:30pm and typically staff this late at night aren't the friendliest. Not here! I really enjoyed their energy and positive attitudes, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I was craving a healthier option for dinner near me and stumbled upon this place. I saw they have poke bowls so I was immediately sold on trying it. They have many options for what you can put in your poke bowl. They also have other bowls with cooked meats and sushi rolls too. Everyone there was so nice, helpful, and patient while we figured out what we want in our bowls. My salmon poke bowl was perfection and my husband's steak and udon noodle bowl was great too. This is our new favorite healthy & fast place to eat!"}
{"text":"Super delicious, healthy and inexpensive lunch.  Just opened a couple weeks ago.  I have tried the skewers ($4 for 3 with white meat chicken), the spring rolls and two different salads - the Hookipa Salad with salmon and the Kihei Salad. All were delicious, but my favorite is the Hookipa Salad. I only get the half salad ($6.25) and it's plenty of food.  Finally, a lunch place under $10!  Great service.  Sit out on the patio before it's too hot to do so!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat I absolutely love the service and how fast everything is made and given to you. It's always clean everything you go in and the food is amazing!!! Not greasy or heavy it's very light and leaves you feeling very satisfied! I will keep coming back here I just can't get enough :) 

P.s. thank you to Shane for giving me a coupon for $5 off my next meal when I forgot to use it my first time ordering through the app. Very good customer service and a very good employee :) I already used the coupon I was so happy that they were willing to honor that for me."}
{"text":"The vegetables have no flavor and taste like water, consistency wise they were cooked well. The Cali roll is dry and tasted fishy, $4/4 piece roll is expensive. The only items I liked were the sliced ginger and chicken out of everything I tried. I've been once before and didn't really care for it, came back and wasn't impressed. My dining partner loves this place, to each their own."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner at this place. They have healthy food options and the go to Terriyaki sauce is a perfect consistency and taste. I had the bento box with edamame, chicken and brown rice as well as the California roll. 

I was a little disappointed with the rice texture, the roll was falling apart. I also think the overly salted the edamame. I liked that they separate the chicken from the sauce and do not drown the chicken in it. For the price I thought it was a good weekly dinner overall."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. Ordered the Texas Roll 4 piece,Yo Roll 4 piece General Joes Soup and Joes Original Teriyaki bowl and two drinks.
Sat down soup and teriyaki bowl came out first soup was warm not hot. Teriyaki bowl look delish, out came sushi that looked good but very smaller than what I'm use to seeing at AH-SO. Four bites into my soup and crunch???..ouch! I spit into a napkin and it's a sharp piece of plastic in my soup. I got the register girls attention she came over saw the sharp plastic piece and apologized for it she went back to the kitchen came back to tell me it was from a container that shattered and refund only $30.08 of my $32.? No manager comes to see, not even a full refund or offer to come back and try it again? I got a percentage of what I paid to have bitten down on to a sharp plastic piece that was in my food..? Wow!! I called their GM left message. Waiting for a call back. I'm confused but is this customer service and that piece was lodged in between my back teeth when I bit down. I don't think so...."}
{"text":"I started coming here about a year ago and loved the \"create your own bowl\" option. All the sudden the quality has gone way down. Everything in my bowl is mushy and overcooked and for the amount you pay, I would expect not to get ripped off on the amount of ingredients. Literally 2 Pieces of broccoli in my bowl. I probably won't be returning back. I thought I would give it another try hoping it would be better but it's gotten worse."}
{"text":"I had the Shrimp Spring Rolls and the Yakitori Bowl.  The rolls were fresh and flavorful.  The peanut sauce with them was fairly good.

However, the Yakitori Bowl, which is stated to be over ramen noodles, was actually over what seemed like over cooked spaghetti.  The chicken in the bowl was all white and cleaned well.  The vegetables were fresh and the Yakitori sauce had a good flavor.  I just wish that the \"ramen\" noodles were really ramen noodles.

I will try other items on the menu.  Since the flavors were right, I would assume that a dish over rice or just vegetables would be quite good."}
{"text":"I get such great service here from staff who care about food allergies. They are incredibly cautious in their food handling, and they make a fantastic teriyaki chicken rice bowl. They remember me by name, and they remember how I like my order. They greet me like an old friend when I walk in the door. That's why we visit at least twice a month, and sometimes every week. Brittany, Scott, and Taylor are the reasons I keep coming back (along with the food, of course)."}
{"text":"Very good,fresh, and healthy food.  Had it 2 days in a row. Try your meal carb free and still be satisfied at the end."}
{"text":"The traditional bowl had a toafood type taste and texture. Friends didn't like theirs either. The sushi was eh."}
{"text":"I was so hungry when we arrived here for lunch and I was really looking forward to it.  Ordered a small bowl with tofu, teriyaki, avocado and vegetables.  The tofu was about 3/4 inch cubes that was soft.  I liked it and the teriyaki sauce.  The avocado was perfect.  The vegetables were a huge disappointment.  You pay $1.35 extra to have vegetables in the bowl - I had broccoli, zucchini, asparagus, snap peas, mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts.  All of the vegetables were steamed, not cooked enough (the asparagus was so think and like eating sticks), flavorless and without sauce.  I had to go to the register and ask for extra sauce.

IF I ever went here again I would try a small white rice bowl with tofu, teriyaki and avocado.  That's it.

My son got the steak bowl with spicy-aki on noodles.  The steak smelled and tasted terrible.  Cheap texture.  He got it on the noodles which did not look appetizing.  

My daughter got the white chicken teriyaki bento box with brown rice, edamame, white milk and cookie for $5.  She was happy and her meal seemed like the best deal.

My son and I each got a fountain drink.  There was a big choice of fresh brewed iced tea.  Tried the sugar free sweetened one and it was just okay.  Then got the black tea which was good but they didn't have sweet & low.  

So lunch for me and two kids - $28.  Not a bargain by any stretch of the imagination.

I left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good healthy food at a decent price. Parking can get tricky around lunch time so come early or late."}
{"text":"Tokyo Joes seems to be the fast casual spot that I've been looking for.  Although not Korean and definitely a Japanese influence the noodle based bowls are on point.  I've snagged the resolution bowl as well and have to say that is bomb dot com.  Nothing fancy here, but if you're into nutrition and training for sports this place will give you the clean and fast stuff to fit your diet."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. My order was messed up, not a big deal. But when i brought it up, they were extremely rude and rushed me as if I ordered wrong. Also the person I spoke with blamed his employee for why the order was wrong. Not professional. The food wasn't' bad."}
{"text":"Pricing was ok, service was average, food was pretty good. Only issue is that they are very skimpy on the sauces, which makes the food a little dry."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time yesterday, I got the General Joe's Soup and it was AMAZING. The workers here were also extremely friendly and helpful when trying to decide on what to get from the menu. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time earlier today and was super impressed. There are a lot of clean eating options and they even have stevia based sauces. I liked it so much I decided to come back but this time I downloaded their app and wanted to use the \"firsttimer\" promo as it gives you $5 off. There seemed to be some sort of error message, so I decided to walk in and order. I showed the cashier the error message and she said \"yea, we are aware. Sorry about that.\" I asked if there was anyway I could still get the $5 off seeing as how the issue was with their app and I had done my part to download (hence the incentive to download a company's app). She went to ask the manager and the manager said \"no, I would have to use it for next time\". I didn't argue but pointed out that their app was faulty and in the spirit of customer service and customer experience - you would think a manager would be making an exception. My rating is 3 stars based on this experience and not the food."}
{"text":"We checked this place out one night for dinner after passing by a few weeks earlier.  The staff was welcoming, the restaurant was clean and modern, but the food was just ok.  I ordered the  curry sauce with my noodles, chicken and veggies, but the sauce wasn't mixed in...it  was too hard to mix it since the bowl was filled to the top.  Reasonably priced for the amount of food, but just not sure the quality is there!"}
{"text":"Ordered some sushi Togo from here and thought I would try it out. If you want real sushi do not go here the crab they use is a cheap mix. The miso soup tastes like dirt water with no flavor what so ever. Not sure about their other food on the menu but the sushi is not worth the money"}
{"text":"More \"Joe\" than \"Tokyo\".

Okay, so you're not an authentic Japanese cuisine snob. You still shouldn't go to this place. Going by dish, the Ramen we had was pretty bland and the noodles were soft and overcooked, while the rolls- while fresh -were fairly tasteless. My wife's Bento was just as lackluster, featuring similarly overly soft soba, tasteless chicken, and more tasteless rolls. Though $30 for two people might seem like a reasonable price point, the quality is nowhere close to any reasonable expectation versus other restaurants of similar theme."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick, easy, healthy meal, look no further. Tokyo Joe's is your place! Great spot to run in and get a healthy bowl for lunch. Has now become my new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Choose your protein, choose your starch, add some veggies and choose a sauce. I had chicken, rice, veggies and green curry sauce - everything was cooked well and tasted very fresh. 5 stars because they have multiple selections of *real* brewed iced tea.

Parking is a pain - as expected on that corner."}
{"text":"This place is good! Good is good quality is good. A little pricy in my opinion. So I like flame broiler or wabba grill better. But this place is a great option but it's not 5 out 5 it's 4 out of place for sure. My fav mojo bowl. Tell them easy on the sauce! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Really good fresh food, lots of choices. And really nice staff. They also have vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I like to stop here to eat when I'm in Gilbert to workout at my gym on that side of town. It's tasty healthy goodness. I had a steak bowl with udon noodles this visit and it was yummy."}
{"text":"I go to Tokyo joes on Monday's. Buy one get one free, most likely because the fish truck comes on Tuesday's I have to assume. A new Tokyo joes opened up on Grand ave in surprise, AZ. Was visiting the parents and it was very very good for the price, filled to the lid, everything was assorted well around the bowl. I come back to the Tempe location because I live out there and wow it was like a compete 180. It basically looked like they did not care at all, just threw rice in and the assortments, barley even cut the avocado. My food was ice cold even though I ordered a pick up time and I was there 1 minute after the time I had put down. Wasn't expecting the rice to be ice cold. I would avoid this location at all costs. If you're in surprise, AZ I would definitely recommend the new location on bell ave and you can see what a Tokyo joes poke bowl should look like

Edit: went to 1 star after management said they would send me gift card for terrible experience and never sent gift card. Shady management form shady restaurant"}
{"text":"We frequent Tokyo Joe's. The place is awesome and has a variety of options so that you can enjoy a healthy meal. My favorite is the poke bowl. Definitely have to do double protein which makes it a little more expensive, however about the same price as ahipoke bowl. Oh & the service is great!"}
{"text":"I had to wait FOREVER for my food! I had such a simple order as well. People who also ordered after me got their orders before me!!! I AM ANGRY."}
{"text":"This is not your \"traditional\" japanese food. More like fusion to me. Not a big fan. 
Built my own bowl with spicy ahi sauce. It tastes like the sauce they use in chef boyardee.
The spring rolls, which I thought were going to be your typical fried spring roll was a cold roll. Again, not a big fan. The ramen was made with soba noodles, not ramen noodles. 
I'm from HI and this is not Japanese. It's a healthy bland of freshness."}
{"text":"Food didn't really have much flavor to it.  Not to mention, their \"Tokyo Joe's drinks\" were just as plain as the food."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Tokyo Joe's on Camelback. I'm not in the area often so I made sure that when I was there next I would make a stop. 

I took note of the signage as I walked in - line moves fast! Ok, got it! One customer was in front of me and needed help ordering (seemed to be her first time as it was mine). The cashier asked for me to pass by her if I was ready to order. At first I thought this was courteous but realize the cashier was rather impatient and particularly rude. Perhaps this is a company culture issue?

After placing my order to-go, I stood near by thinking this would be a quick stop, then the waiting began. Almost 15 minutes passed before I had my to-go order. The rude cashier along with all the other staff were preoccupied with another staff member's tardiness that the food and service both suffered. Fast? Seems like this 'tagline' needs some improvement.

Once I was able to try the food I had ordered, I was even more disappointed. The AHI was not properly trimmed and seemed out of date (fish should not taste fishy!). Worried about quality, I didn't have another bite. 

POKE bowls seem popular right now but it doesn't look like Tokyo Joe's has it figured it out yet. If I try again, it won't be this location and won't be anything 'fishy.'"}
{"text":"Trendy, healthy and fun.  Order a bowl, add veggies, sauce and watch the team create a masterpiece. 

I like to splash some siracha on my bowl to increase the heat. 

This location is more upscale than most and makes for a great date night bite on your way to the movies or on the way back from a hike."}
{"text":"Just another chain thats all about the money but lazy and doesnt care about customers being . They say you can customize bowls to have stuff you like but i was told my order was too complicated...  They used to have mints too after your meal but no more...and the gm is very rude and amatuer. I wouldnt be surprised to learn that all 4 of them smoked Marijuana cigarettes... Reefers. Good food but you dont even know where the line starts. #dontgetaddicted"}
{"text":"Unique concept that my wife and I enjoyed for a quick lunch.  I got the Arizona roll which was tasty and a build your own bowl with white chicken, udon noodles and the red dragon sauce.  The bowl was very good and spicy.  My wife had the Nikko salad which she really enjoyed.  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding with lots of gluten
free options. Everything was so fresh and even the smaller serving was huge! We had enough left over for take out for tomorrow! They forgot my sauce but brought it immediately. We made a mistake in ordering and they fixed it with no questions. Outstanding service, a greàt experience. We will be going back."}
{"text":"How's this for a picture of our recent experience?

The door to the side parking lot is broken, and there is only one customer in and out of the place.

Then you walk in, and you see several unkempt tables with leftover food and dishes. We walk towards the counter, and there are several customers still waiting for their food. A guest of note is a Father and his hungry daughter awaiting their ToGo order.

The harried lady, who appears to be the manager, takes our food order and we sit down right next to the Father and his daughter.

20 minutes later, we finally get our food, and they still haven't gotten theirs. We could sense that he was getting really perturbed, and his little girls doing all that she could to stay coherent and calm.

Then he finally gets up, and angrily asks for a refund, and they walk out to get sustenance from the nearby sandwich shop.

We inspect our food, and the sushi was very very dry. The portions of meat, that used to be quite generous, were quite sparse as if they were had run out of chicken and beef and were trying to save as much as they could for other customers. The accompanying side salad was dreadful!

And to top it all of, the other unkempt tables were still in the same state as when we first walked in a half hour ago! It wouldn't be so bad, if there weren't a gaggle of employees just milling about by the counter. How about you clean the place up?

This is the same kind of experience we had with Samurai Sam's, which is why we never visit that place - EVER! And that was at least 4 years ago. (Yes, I have a long memory for bad dining experiences)

The same goes for this establishment. They'll never get another penny from us."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. The people are really nice, the environment is clean and inviting and the food I love. I will
Continue to come to my new \"go to\" place. :)"}
{"text":"Over priced, sushis are really small, but really good! I had the Arizona and it was great! Spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience and friendly staff. Was not busy when I came on a Monday mid afternoon which was normal."}
{"text":"Always awesome service, they know me by name and always remember what I forget to add to my order. They have good suggestions as add ons or alternatives to my \"normal\" order. Top notch always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"1st timer at TJ's.

Another solid C on the grading curve.  It was just.......OK.
I ordered the bento box, Tofu, brown rice, salad and spicy tuna roll.
The Teriyaki sauce is freaking incredible. The roll was ok. I did dig the tofu rice and sauce. My return is a maybe."}
{"text":"This place was a big let down. Ordered dark chicken bowl with brown rice. Chicken was mush and tasted like Costco rotisserie chicken.  The chicken was NOT GRILLED!Asked for Stevi Yaki sauce and didn't get it. For $10.00 I figured it would be better food. I was hoping it was going to be good because the idea sounds great. Just poor execution. Seriously if your the owner and reading this, you need to fix this place. Mushy chicken is not acceptable.

I was contacted by the owner and offered a replacement for my meal. That is above and beyond in my book. So for that I'll give them 2 stars instead of one. Maybe I'll try a poke bowl in the future. Everyone deserves a second chance right?"}
{"text":"This time I had the Tataki salad but with salmon instead of tuna....redemption is the word that comes to mind....I really liked it.  Skip the sweet syrup sauces and do the salad"}
{"text":"Good stuff, stick with the bowls, salads were all greens hardly any protein. Add the table side siracha for kick!"}
{"text":"Iv been to this Tokyo Joes a few times and am always very pleased by their level of excellent customer service. From the cashiers to the sushi chef to the food preps. Today I found out about their BOGO sushi deals on Monday and excited for that. Thanks for the excellent service, it is noticed."}
{"text":"I just ordered the make your bowl with udon and double white meat protein and veggies. Absolutely amazing!! I used the app for delivery and am completely happy!! Also, I tried the green curry sauce and love it. Lots of food and very fresh."}
{"text":"For this class of restaurant, I'm entirely satisfied. I think prices are on par, and portions are generous. We got build your own bowls in large because we'd read reviews that said portions were small. Mistake! 
The food is delicious and I like that it's different than our usual Mexican food or burger choices. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Ramen noodle soup was so good and can't beat the price place is very clean and new customer service is great my new favorite noodle place."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for a roll that they forgot to make before you tell them to just forget it then THIS IS YOUR PLACE!!! They suck!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ramen bowl, and was underwhelmed. I believe they just used regular egg noodles, because they had no chew to them. The broth was just plain chicken broth, like you'd make chicken soup with. The toppings included baby spinach, a split hard boiled egg, water chestnuts, and sliced chicken they'd squirted teriyaki sauce on top of. Not your traditional ramen, and not much flavor (even with the teriyaki sauce dressing. I will say the spinach was fresh, the service prompt, and the restaurant clean. I could have done with less 80's music playing in the background (tho that may be a plus for some!). If I come back, I'll probably try one of the rice bowls instead of ramen. For those craving ramen, Fujiya market on Saturdays is a much better bet."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Yummy food - fabulous service - ambiance is lovely for a fast food place.  Fresh, healthy ingredients!   Chicken, beef, fish, eggs, tofu.  Vegis.  Gluten free sauce and sugar free sauces.  I eat well here AND have lost weight eating here.  Nice serving dishes and their to - go containers are great for future use - I am addicted to Tokyo Joes and could not be happier about this little addiction!  Newest item on menu - POKE!!!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joes caught my eye even before it opened. It is located in a convenient shopping center in Ahwatukee right next to Sams club and other places I go to often. I was excited to see that a healthy \"eat good, feel good\" Asian restaurant was opening. My bf and I tried it yesterday and we were not disappointed. The modern decor inside was very appealing and their menu had me struggle on what to order because everything sounded so good. We went with the Yakitori bowl and upgraded to the \"Big\" size to share. We also ordered the Cali Tare Tare sushi roll and a drink which all came out to $20 even. Not bad. The taste is a little less flavorful than most typical asian dishes, probably due to the health factor, but adding chili powder or sriracha did the trick. We went around 4:40pm with not many other customers there so our food came out in less than 10 minutes. Super fresh and yummy. Will definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"I'm going to use this Tokyo Joe's Yelp review platform to give everyone a lesson in Economics 101: The Time Value of Money.

The Time Value of Money essentially means that Time is Money.  We all know this, yes, but do we practice it?  A few things that are examples of people NOT taking into account the time value of money:

1. Waiting in line for an hour for a free order of $5 chicken.
2. Standing outside of Wal Mart for 4 hours on Thanksgiving to save $50 on an iPad.
3. Spending an hour cooking and cleaning up a dinner for two that would have cost $5 more per person had we just freaking gone to Tokyo Joe's.

As you may have guessed, I basically decided a long time ago that the four waking hours I have at home after working Monday-Friday are way too important to spend washing dishes, so I'm a big fan of places like Tokyo Joe's where I can get affordable, healthy dishes that relieves a little bit of the society-induced guilt I get for eating out for almost every single meal I eat.

I also love that a few of their sauces have no added sugar, which I try to avoid, and they have the \"No Carb Extra Veggies\" option which is delicious and fits well into the diet I am perpetually on. For some reason doing this is $1.40 or so extra. I don't really like paying extra to not eat carbs, as not eating carbs is punishment enough, but at least here I have the option.

Besides the veggie bowls, another one of my go-to items is the salmon hookipa salad, add avocado. You get a decent-size and -quality piece of salmon and a half of a sliced avocado for about $10 (half portion, including the avocado surcharge which I at least understand this time).  

All in all this is a solid place that Lance and I go at probably once a week or so to get filled up quickly, cheaply, and with less guilt than most quick and cheap options (except chipotle which will always be my fast casual bae). Now please go so I don't have to worry about them shutting down anytime soon because I seriously cannot STAND doing dishes."}
{"text":"Soso. I ordered the surf and turf, it's too sweet for my liking. My husband ordered the poke, very few pieces of tuna, there's too many fillers such as beans and rice. The place is trendy and nice. Actually that's the only thing that I liked in this place. Will probably not go back unless there's a promo or something."}
{"text":"Was going to give this place 3 stars for effort, and because I only made one visit, but they managed to lose one at the very end of my visit. 

I was out searching for something new and different in the area, with out much luck. That's when I spotted Tokyo Joe's Healthy Asian Grill.  I decided to give it a shot. Should've known I wasn't in for the best Asian dining experience, when I walked in and the place looked like every other new fast food place that have been popping up in the area. Ex: Cafe Rio, Cafe Zupas, etc. Sadly there also wasn't a single Asian person in the place. 

Ordering was fairly quick, with sushi, build your own bowl, and a couple pre -designed items. The place offers several different iced tea options, sadly, the first two selections I made were empty. I ordered the gyoza appetizer, ramen noodles, and the aforementioned iced tea. 

I'm going to preface this by saying that I grew up in a primarily Asian family, so I hold my Asian foods to a higher standard. That being said, the food sucked. The gyoza's were of the pre packaged store bought variety (or at least the taste and texture suggested that) with a few dried out green onions sprinkled on top. The accompanying dipping sauce was good (ponzu I believe). Ramen was over cooked and bland. The broth had a decent flavor, but was not enough to save the meal. The egg was too over over cooked for my liking. Chicken also seemed pre packaged. 

So here's where they lost a star. Managers take note. If a staff member makes eye contact with a customer, they should at least be acknowledged. ESPECIALLY if the customer says something to them. On my way out the door, one of the employees crossed paths with me. I said excuse me as I made my way by, then said have a nice night. They looked at me as if they were deaf... (If they were actually deaf, I'll retract this part of my review) 

Either way, long story short, no I would not recommend this place and will not be back. If you're going out for Asian, there's many places I would recommend, over this one, that are in the area. Try Thai Chili or Simis Cafe instead. 

Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"So I love Ramen. Ive been searching for a place with good ramen on this side of the valley. Tokyo Joes is not the place for that. I tried the General Joes ramen and it was bland. The soup base has no flavor and tasted like water. The rice noodles were under done. The bowl came out luke warm, almost cold. The only good parts of the soup were the pieces of chicken and mushroom. Those were really juicy and moist. 

My wife had the chicken teriyaki bento box. She said it was nothing special. The chicken in hers desperately needed the teriyaki sauce. Rice was meh. Noodles, bland. 

They had a few different teas available to drink and were delicious. Make sure you fill the cup with ice before or no ice at all. 

Their motto i believe is eat good and feel good. Well, I ate meh and feel meh."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service. Extremely clean very well priced and very competent staff. Thank you"}
{"text":"Already a fan of this place.  Love the chicken bowls, sushi, ice tea selection. Clean eating and fast.  Had the poke bowl today for first time; super good!!! Absolutely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The service was really bad! Although I was the only person in the restaurant it took almost 15 minutes to get my meal. I took it to go and after I left I realized that they didn't even include any of the vegetables that I was supposed to have in my meal. Extremely disappointing! My main meal consisted only of noodles and tofu and I had to eat the sushi with a fork because as soon as I tried to pick it up it completely fell apart. Nothing tasted very good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  They get an \"A\" for consistency in treating customers poorly. This employee clearly rolled his eyes at the girl in front of me and asked her to get in the looooooooooong line to pay for her \"online\" order. When I said I paid online when he was trying to direct me to the end of the line too he rolled his eyes and reluctantly  got my order. They have no concept of service.  My bad for giving them another try."}
{"text":"After waiting 25 minutes, mind you I came in when it was basically empty I decided to just get a refund. The girl making the sushi was so of putting. All she did was complain about how \"busy\" it was while giving her coworkers attitude. When I did get a refund, there was no apology. This is why places like this fail and close down, customer service."}
{"text":"Great little place to satisfy your Asian cuisine cravings. Staff is super friendly, and atmosphere is open and clean. Generous portions, too. Convenient location at Town and Country plaza."}
{"text":"We were on a short vacation in Phoenix and found this place while driving around.  Our relatives live in Avondale.  I would definitely come back next time.  My stomach wasn't feeling very well and the delicious hot green tea that comes in its on special glass pot was perfect.  They gave me extra fresh ginger to go with my mango ahi sushi.  My hubby had an excellent chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice and veggies. I love vegetarian friendly menus and organic non-gmo places like this. Nice atmosphere and not very expensive.  The service was good and they were friendly too."}
{"text":"The food is good.. the pricing is equal to that of chipotle, if that's your thing, but the service??? Oh my goodness.. I could have grown the ingredients it took to make the food faster than it took to serve someone. I waited for 30 minutes for my food.. I ordered a regular bowl, nothing crazy. How is that even possible ??? Well I started looking at the kitchen to see how that was possible and I came to the conclusion that there is no pep in anyone's step. They move like they don't have much to accomplish for the day. The cashier was not really friendly and the looks on everyones face is so unpleasant. Actually, the only pleasant interaction I had was a server that spilled my drink but she didn't mean to and was very apologetic and accommodating so thank you to her. Maybe it was a bad day at he restaurant and like I said the food is great, but I wish the service was a match."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The sushi roll I got was horrible tasting and the white meat chicken was rubbery and fatty. The spicey-yaki tasted like pure sugar. 
The only good part about this place was the girl taking our order. She was great."}
{"text":"So first off this place is way expensive. I am doing low carb got a bowl with double veggies and then a kids meal. I didn't even get a drink. Everything was over $20. If you have a family of 4 prepare to spend around $50.
The kids bento box was big my bowl was super Tiny. Nothing special just steak veggies and sauce on the side.  Might be a while before I come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great portions and prices, service and the flavors are bold."}
{"text":"I really appreciate fast food restaurants that feature healthy food: no large portions of meat and lots of veggies. Basically the Chinese traditional cuisine.

I ordered the yaktori bowl that had ramen noodles, chicken & vegetables. 

Thin slices of breast meat were clumped on top of almost firm noodles and a variety of fresh veggies and all covered with a strong sauce that overwhelmed the other flavors.

My companions customized their bowls choosing rice, steak, chicken or salmon with veggies of their choice. There was an option for the sauce to be in a separate container.

The layout and furnishings were plain modern functional. But the soda machine was so designed that if you are not very careful your hand will be drenched with soda when you try to get ice in your cup,"}
{"text":"Just not good... got the bento box. Sushi was unedible. Salmon was hard. Do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joes is very good for fast food sushi. (It is not very good for sit down table service, $75 bottles of sake sushi.)

The bowls are well-portioned, the bento box is a tasty lunch and the rolls are fresh, if a little gimmicky. 

I like that there are several lower calorie/ \"healthy\" options (I'm a fan of the Resolution Bowl and the seasonal Ichigo salad looks killer)."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the first time and none of us liked the food, it didn't taste fresh and it had no flavor. Yogis grill is much better."}
{"text":"I get more tuna on my shirt when I eat at the competitor than what I got on my \"bowl\". What a joke. Skip this place. Dirty tables, weird vibe all around."}
{"text":"I have to update my review. We get takeout from here almost every Monday. They've screwed up my order twice now and don't seem to give a crap. Customer service from the person answering the phone to the manager... disappointing. But I still love the food so I'll keep my fingers crossed that they figure it out."}
{"text":"We gave the California Roll a second chance and it gets my sons approval.  This place is a huge hit with the whole family. Something for everyone here.  The Build your own Bowl and Bento Boxes are great.  The Salmon and Mahi-Mahi are both hits with Grandma, the Teriyaki Chicken is a hit with the kids and they even have salads and wraps.  I recently tried the Po-Kay bowls which are also delicious.  One more thing to love Sweet Potato."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick meal. Had the Tokyo salad, super fresh and good dressing. Husband liked the California rolls. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"Coworkers kept telling me about this place. It was pretty decent, a little pricey. I had the ramen (since I was battling a little cold) very taste and the chicken was nice and tender and meaty. I will be going back to try the rolls and poke bowls."}
{"text":"I really want to like you, Tokyo Joe's, but I just can't. 

I really can't expect authentic ramen from fusion restaurants like this, but that was honestly what I would consider a glorified chicken noodle soup. You didn't even try... 

The ramen's \"pork\" broth is very salty and I wasn't sure why there was 1 random piece of edamame swimming around. The chicken teriyaki bowl is also salty. 

This is my fault for trusting Phoenix / Scottsdale yelp reviews.

2 stars for the interior and service!

{"text":"This place is suppose to be \"healthy Asian\" but I was not impressed. However it gets pretty busy during lunch. I had a bowl and sushi and its safe to safe I won't be back. I was pretty disappointed too because the service was great and I want to lovw this place. After all who wouldn't live this idea of \"healthy Asian\" but it really fell short of my expectations. :/"}
{"text":"First time eating here. And I have to say I am very impressed. Healthy ingredients, clean cooking excellent staff and a great selection of dishes. 
Ordered the resolution bowl with the spicy teriyaki sauce. 
Will most definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Severely disappointed at this location .  Went with coworker to try & pick up for lunch this past Mon.  Both of our orders for make your own bowls were incorrect when we got to work., we both ordered sweet potatoes which we got none of.  Manager was very sorry & gave us both free meals for next visit.  We decided to go back Thursday & redeem our meals & give it another shot.   Again I was so disappointed, checked our food before we left rest., my bowl was wrong again , veggies I didn't order & then none of what I did.  Steak was also really over cooked.  Also chef was shaking his head when I went up to report things.  Received another card free entree....very doubtful I'll return!!"}
{"text":"Awesome bowls!!!! The surf and turf is really good. Could use a little less rice. The price isn't bad either. Looking forward to going there again"}
{"text":"I have been going there for lunch pretty much twice a week ever since they opened. But for some reason, started last week, their food quality have been going down hill, and they give you about half of the amount of the food than they used to when they first open. I always get the Ahi Poke Bowl, and was impressed by the fish quality and just overall quality when they first started. But now, I've gotten the Poke bowl twice since last week, and both time the fish were SUPER mushy and you can tell it's just not as fresh or good quality as before! I mean, I would give it about 3 more times to see if it gets improved, if not I would just stop going there. For people that don't eat raw fish but like to just try their bowl though, I really can't rate on that because Poke Bowl is what I always get."}
{"text":"Portions were small  compared to Pei Wei's bowl and AhiPoke who have much more additions including avocado, seaweed, edamame, rice etc for about the same price. I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place for healthy good quality teriyaki!veggies are always fresh and staff are always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was horrible. I order 5 build your own bowls to-go and the only one that wasn't messed up was the kids chicken and rice. Seeing how it recently opened I figured I'd try it again before reviewing. 

Second experience was identical. Ordered to-go and was given someone else's order. They did correct my order but it's still annoying. Could just be my luck at this place. 

The foods a solid 4 stars but I probably won't be returning due to the hassle of ordering in advance for a quick pick up and it never being right.

Third experience: was given a few free meal vouchers so of course I'm back! I've been trying to love this place because I can build my own healthy bowl right after the gym. Tonight they didn't disappoint! White chicken with x2 veggies and habanero dragon sauce!!! Bomb!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and Tokyo Joe's was within walking distance of our hotel.  The menu can be a bit intimidating with all the choices.  The staff were very helpful and we got our Poke bowls ordered.  I loved that there was such a wide variety of things to go into the Poke bowls.  I got the salmon Poke bowl.  The food was delicious and fresh tasting.  We will definitely go back when we are back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We checked this place out a few weeks ago and it was really good.  Being our first time there we were pleased and would return.  It was fresh, flavorful and a good serving amount.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"It is lunch time and they are moving like turtles..slow and the young girl at the counter host 101 is rude and sassy and does not like her job...the noodles are mushy and broken up they should try an all around different approach food and service were awful."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong eating here! So many great choices, great concept and overall great food! Healthy options, no/low carb options are a huge plus, and they aren't skimpy on their good veggies! It's one of my top choices for sure - will be back, A LOT!"}
{"text":"Love this place, affordable healthy and clean... 
We eat out often as we both work full time and have no children at home anymore.
sometime more of a hassle to cook and clean.. This has become one of our replacements for Chipotle as we are so burned out on it.

affordable, and always ready for pick up when I call ahead!!"}
{"text":"A fresh alternative

Tokyo Joe's is a stand-up to order restaurant that serves Japanese noodle bowls and sushi.  The restaurant has ample seating and the staff are friendly and helpful.  You order at the counter, take a seat, and your meal is brought to your table.

This was my first visit to Tokyo Joe's and I was not disappointed. I ordered the  \"Create your own Bowl\"  with white chicken, bean sprouts, red peppers, onions, steamed rice, and teriyaki sauce.  My dish had loads of meat, rice, veggies, and a great taste. The bowls are large enough that I'll get a 2nd meal out of it tomorrow.

Tokyo Joe's is a fresh alternative to the other fast food Japanese restaurants in the area. The service was good, prices are fair, and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"This was a great first experience. Everything was super clean, well kept & everyone was very welcoming. The rice was mixed up for our 2 poke bowls-which is NO BIG DEAL b/c we all mess up, but point is how well the staff handled it. Instead of acting like it could have been our fault or seemingly annoyed with the mistake, they all apologized and were quick to fix it. Rob was very accommodating and also quick to fix the little easy-fix rice mixup."}
{"text":"I realize everyone likes different things but wow - my wife and I eat a lot of sushi and were hungry for sushi while out shopping and found Tokyo Joe's searching for a good place to go. we ordered 2 - 8 pc rolls both tasted awful.  Plus they had just a sliver of fish not any ware near what most places put in them. I literally had to find something to eat or drink to get the taste out of my mouth. Very friendly staff but the food is nasty. I would never want to go here again. Makes me shiver just writing this. Do yourself a favor and go any ware else."}
{"text":"VEGANS & VEGETARIANS BEWARE!!!  Be sure if you order the Boulder Veggie Bowl which comes with Tofu to check what you get! I ordered it because it was vegan and even specified I wanted it vegan and they gave me chicken even though it comes with Tofu!! I unfortunately didn't realize it was chicken until I took a bite and needles to say I was extremely upset! I asked to speak to manager, The manager Jeff came to talk to me and I conformed with him that the dish is to come with tofu and expressed my disappointment. He first stated that,  \"mistakes do happen and he apologized then offered me a coupon\" I advised him that I was not from there, just passing through,  traveling. He then offered me a refund. I believe that was the very least that he could do, but informed him that what if it had been an allergy reason request that they messed up on, what would the circumstances had been? That is a huge error and a very careless mistake at that. I was so upset, I will never go back to this chain ever again!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh food.
Belly is full -- I am a happy customer :)
Their vegetarian options are good.
I do not recommend getting their spring rolls, as guessed not authentic, but what to expect when ordering from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Very corporate. Cali roll was super fishy ( that's never a good sign). If you like franchise dining this place could do in a pinch. We (3 of us) had rice bowls with chicken. The bowls were not terrible, but they weren't great either. 

The sauce was like maple syrup sweet. I did not eat very much of my rice bowl and neither did my family. We won't be running back for more."}
{"text":"This was only ok. I got the ahi poke bowl and my stomach didn't feel right after.... the fish smelled and tasted a TINY bit fishy, which is not a sign of super quality seafood. Especially for Arizona, they need to make sure they're serving good quality. 

The lady at the front was nice, but the woman at the sushi station was very agitated about helping out or providing sauce samples. This, however, is not calculated into the stars. 

The rice tasted a little moldy -- like it was cooked in a pot that was cleaned with a moldy rag. I won't be going back, but will be trying other poke bowls in the city."}
{"text":"Over all I thought the food was mediocre. I ordered the \"build your own bento box\". The sushi was grocery store quality (90% rice), the chicken was good not great. The cucumber salad as probably my favorite dish. The food was fresh but the price is a little high for the quantity and quality."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! We were looking for fast-casual as we were bringing our active 16 month old grandson. Tokyo Joe's was nearby and the menu looked good for the 5 of us vegetarians. Lots of great options for us, appealing atmosphere (loved the lamps), very clean and fast service. We ordered a kids meal, a couple of bowls and a bento box. The food was hot, fresh and nicely presented. My grandson loved his kid's \"bento box\" with mandarin oranges, udon, tofu and veggies. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"There are so many places to choose from in this shopping center for food.  We decided to give this place a shot.  holy smokes.  I've never had better Asian cuisine.  And yes, I do mean cuisine even though this is a \"fast food\" place, it's all freshly made, served piping hot, and I don't think there's anything deep fried on the menu (well, maybe tempura shrimp, not sure).  It's not often that I make yummy sounds when I am eating but that day, I sure did.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his food as well.  I had the surf and turf bowl (steak and shrimp) and he had something with chicken & veggies.. can't recall.  It was amaze-balls!   We will go out of our way to go back."}
{"text":"So I about freaked out when I saw that this place was coming to town, when I lived in Denver it was one of my favorite places! You can certainly tell that the staff is still figuring out things but they have great customer service so I think this place will be a neighborhood favorite! They are also working on getting their liquor license- nothing better with sushi than an ice cold beer!"}
{"text":"the reason for 2 stars was the only thing good about it was the flavor of the teriyaki sauce.  the portions were so tiny, we left hungry and had to stop by Wendys and order more food.  i was not impressed.  we figured the order would come out all together but this is not the case.  after we got our main meals, it was another 10 minutes before my daughter got her meal which was sushi. pretty poor service.  our food was barely warm and almost cold by the time our daughter got her dinner.  prices were very high for what you get, not a good value.  we basically wasted our money here to leave hungry.  not going back. very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious fast Asian fusion food! I love that they have sugar free teriyaki and double veggies. It makes for a healthy quick meal that you can feel good about. The service is great. The staff is attentive and helpful. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was the WORST thing I have tasted since moving to the east valley. This was the first time we had eaten here, placed an order online to go and paid $12 PER REG SIZE BOWL (which is pricey). We got home and there was NO sauce on anything! When I called the location they tried to tell me I didn't ask for it which clearly my receipt showed I did, he then responded with \"oh man, I totally didn't see that\"..... ? Ok, we tried to make the most of our unseasoned bland bowls by adding some curry we had in our cabinets which could not salvage this horrible purchase. Meats were unseasoned, the veggies were clearly frozen bagged veggies and I had a whole puddle of water at the bottom of my bowl. If I wanted soggy bland food I could have just bought a bag of frozen mixed veggies for $3 and threw it in the microwave cause that is basically what we got. I will NEVER eat here again and neither should you."}
{"text":"great salad
hookipa salad
wild salmon or steak, mixed greens, spinach, pecans, cranberries, edamame beans, sunomono, soy ginger dressing. also available with white chicken.  garnished with ginger."}
{"text":"First of all if you are looking for authentic Ramen, you will be disappointed. Real Ramen takes many hours of dedicated broth making and ingredients prep. I used to live in Vancouver, where true Japanese Ramen places exists and are usually lined up down the street with hungry customers. I haven't yet found real Ramen anywhere in the valley. The \"Ramen\" here is just chicken broth with spaghetti noodles and a couple of items you expect in real Ramen. It just isn't even close. However, the other soup they offer is amazing so just have that. If you know of a Japanese Ramen place please message me. Now my review:

I was pleasantly surprised a few weeks back when I walked into Five Guys and realized I was standing in a completely different restaurant. I love Asian food and was happy to have found a new place right where I often go for food. Cafe Rio is next door and one of my spots.
Tokyo Joe's is exactly the kind of place I needed to find. You can literally customize your eating experience. Right now I'm on a slow/no carb kick and am frankly getting a little tired of \"lettuce-wrapping\" everything when I want to eat out. At TJ's I can have veggies galore, choice of proteins, pick from a good variety of flavors and not even have to feel any fast food guilt because it's all fresh and healthy.
Now of course no place is perfect, but what the good folks at TJ's is offering is almost perfect. You can have sushi, rice bowls, noodle bowls, soup and all of it can be altered to your liking by friendly enthusiastic staff.
If you are into iced tea you will be happy to know that they have an iced tea buffet with about 5 different flavors and types. The prices are decent and right now there is a kickass coupon floating around that gets you buy-one-get-one-free entree. I loves a good deal.
I've have eaten here 4 times. The first day I had lunch with a friend and then came back that night with my wife I was that chuffed.
Finally a place I can go to where I don't have to figure my way around bread and rice to get my eat on. Salads with protein gets old quick.
I will say this: It's FREEZING inside. They have the temp set at around 60, likely trying to keep the open-concept kitchen cool. Last time I was there I was literally chattering and shivering my way through my meal. They need to have a separate cooling system for the kitchen or something, so bring a hoodie or brave the patio, but now that summer is here... bring a hoodie.
All in all this is a great addition to our neighborhood and I am an instant fan and will be a regular. Thanks Tokyo Joe's, you may be about as Japanese as Target, but like Target you are spot on and a great place to shop!"}
{"text":"1st Time at a Tokyo Joe's. I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki bowl. It was delicious and quickly served. They went a little thin on the Teriyaki sauce but did not charge for extra sauce so that was nice. Could have used a little more Chicken as well. 
We sat outside and was pleasantly surprised to hear no music playing that we might have to talk over."}
{"text":"I have ordered their custom \"build your own\" bowl a couple of times, (one steak with curry sauce and one was chicken with peanut chili sauce) and once their yakitori bowl. Something is missing with these bowls, they're just not very stimulating. I know this is Japanese fast food but there isn't an ounce of authenticity in the teriyaki sauces and the freshness just isn't there. When I ordered the udon noodles with the yakitori bowl, they were very bland and there wasn't much meat for the price. I mean the bowls are decent and will fill you up, but I've had way better quality and authenticity at other fast food joints. I've tried all of their sushi options, and they can be quite tasty. Love the Arizona roll. The bento box was pretty good, but again the spicy tuna roll wasn't fresh and there wasn't much chicken. The spicy-Aki sauce was not spicy enough for my taste and was overpowered by sweetness. I don't know what it is about this place, but I never seem to be satisfied after meals here. I do however like to come here when I want a light snack, and the fresh spring rolls and sushi rolls do the trick."}
{"text":"Honestly, couldn't even finish my bowl of food. The quality was below par...I should've known when it came out so fast. The spicy teriyaki wasn't very good either. I like the concept, just seems like the quality of all the vegetables could've been better"}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten here I've been really disappointed in the food quality for the price.

I ordered 2 sushi rolls for takeout.  The total was just over $14 and the sushi was terrible.  Did not taste fresh at all.  The rolls you get at Fry's or Sprouts tasted way better!  The sushi was way overpriced for the quality and they didn't even get my order right.  Asked for spicy mayo/white sauce and they did not include it.

The time before this was a similar situation.  Would not recommend at all.  Mediocre service, terrible food, overpriced."}
{"text":"As Colorado transplants, we fell in love with Tokyo Joe's back in Denver.  When we saw they were finally coming to the valley, we waited and hoped that it would live up to our expectations.

I'm pleased to say that it's everything we expected!

For the uninitiated, Tokyo Joe's offers semi-quick and healthy food for very reasonable prices.  We generally order their rice bowls, although I tried one of their salads tonight and was quite happy with it.

It's not all roses... there were a few growing pains when the place first opened down here, but we stuck with it and I can say they've definitely ironed-out the wrinkles.

If you're wanting something that will taste better (and help you live better) than fast food, but you want something faster and less costly than a big restaurant, I'd definitely recommend giving them a shot."}
{"text":"This teriyaki chicken bowl is tasty enough, but is in serious need of more chicken; I mean come-on, I need my protein people!!!  The taste is just okay, not the best.  The decor is nice for a fast food Japanese restaurant, but I don't review on atmosphere / decor, but on quality of food and pride of ownership / customer service.  3 stars is a fair review for the afformentioned determinations."}
{"text":"This is some of the best tasting and freshest food I have ever eaten. The portions are huge and at a great price. The staff is excellent and always friendly. Join the addicts club and get great discounts and free food! Everyone I take here ends up becoming a hard-core addict themselves! I will gladly drive across town to eat here or to bring some home. Try it! You will not be disappointed! I have been to three locations and they all rock! Special shout out Shree at the Tempe location! She always has a smile and takes care of my family and friends like a true pro!"}
{"text":"Saw they were working on this place and couldn't wait to try.  I wasn't disappointed, it was GREAT!  Each of us got different build your own bowls and everything was fresh and tasty.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  There are many choices and all are fully customizable.  The sushi was very good and the bowl was excellent.  Many choices of ice teas to choose from as well if you don't choose to have a beer with your dinner. If you aren't creative, there are predefined bowls on the menu or you can fully build your own.  Pick your protein, your sauce and your veggies as well as the starch.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"First time trying Tokyo Joes - my husband likes it for a particular bowl he orders so thought I'd give it a try. It was so awful I can't believe they served it to pass as food. It was truly inedible. I threw it away and had to go get lunch from somewhere else. 

I ordered the surf and turf bowl which sounded delicious... In reality the beef was only (maybe) an ounce worth, cut up into tiny, sauce soaked pieces, and there were three pieces of flavorless shrimp. The rice was undercooked and the whole thing was covered (and when I say covered I mean it was like a soup) with a very sweet teryaki sauce. There was a spattering of red pepper and mushrooms, but everything just tasted like the sauce soup. 

So bad. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"it takes 37 minutes to get my what i ordered, during lunch time. this place is absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"I love the food here , I had the build your own bowl with lots of veggies, tofu and a yummy sauce . This place is great for fast healthy food"}
{"text":"So let's see.....it's Saturday Night.....the wife and I just finished seeing Spider-man: Homecoming (I am a HUGE Spider-man Fan) and we decided we would stop at Tokyo Joe's afterwards. We had a little bit of trouble finding this establishment at first but when we finally did we absolutely loved the ambiance of the place. I was a huge fan of the big black chairs they have there....you must sit in them they are awesome. I could also see (when it cools off.....LOL) that the outdoor seating will be just simply outstanding. So without further ado......the FOOD.....well I have to tell you we really stopped here because I had a free appetizer and Entree' because I joined the \"Addicts Club\" you must do this before you go to Tokyo Joe's (I simply love rewards programs). Now don't get this confused you don't get an initial deal like this for joining.....the appetizer is yours for joining but I got the free Entree' because it was my HALF BIRTHDAY.....that's right they give you a free entree' for your HALF BIRTHDAY.....is that awesome or what.
 
Now to be honest I didn't think they would give them both to me at the same time but they did and the best part is you don't need to print anything out or show them something on your smartphone......just give them your phone number you used to sign up for the addict club and they will take care of the rest. I ordered the Miso Soup which was delicious and for my entree' I had the \"Build your own Bowl\" selection which consisted of White Rice, Tofu (which they grill for you......I know right......yummy), Teriyaki Sauce, Broccoli, Green Onions, and Mushrooms. They have several different combinations you can select and they have regular menu options as well. I HIGHLY recommend building your own bowl though because I think you get more for your money that way but either way the food....service.....and ambiance are simply OUTSTANDING. So if your hanging out near North Scottsdale RUN don't Walk to Tokyo Joe's and remember Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joes is really popular in Colorado with the large healthy minded population. When I first moved to Phoenix I was bummed out that there was not a Tokyo Joe's in the area. When this place opened I was really happy that there was a go to healthy option for some great tasting healthy food.

My favorite dish there is the combo bowl with brown rice and no brainer veggies added. I always get the curry sauce and love it that they do not charge me more for a extra sauce. The red pepper stuff on the table is really hot so I can get the heat level right where I like it. 

I also like that they use free range antibiotic chicken and Coleman beef. Stop in at Tokyo Joes, it's a no brainer."}
{"text":"OMG made from scratch and made to order sushi and build your own bowls and salads!  First time here and had a great experience with the staff and the food.    Great dining atmosphere at an upscale healthy and very tasty fast food Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service at this location and their staff is so approachable. This place is cool when it comes to just a quick bite to eat without feeling disgusted with yourself after a workout. Their bogo free sushi Mondays are my favorite. I would definitely recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super good food, friendly staff, and a nice space.   The build your own poke bowls are delicious and huge portions for the price.  

After moving here about 1.5 years ago it's been a little bit of a challenge to find good urban and ethnic food spots.  Tokyo Joe's is a nationwide chain but the ambience here and quality doesn't feel like it.   

Definitely a good spot for Asian food."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try take out from a new place. Right off the bat, over priced. Once we got home we found the food to be undercooked. The beef was completely pink and the rice hard and chewy. Oh, and if that weren't enough, there was a bug in my meal. Disgusting."}
{"text":"On a hot summer night, being able to order sushi on my phone then swing by and pick up my pre-paid for meal is a wonderful convenience. The sushi menu is limited but everything was incredibly fresh and tasty. The cold spring rolls were an absolute delight. I can see myself eating here at least once a week. Fresh and healthy. A nice change from Chipotle."}
{"text":"First time ever at a Tokyo Joes.  Love all their options from Bowls to Bento Boxes.  You can even get a sushi role in a bowl form which was new to me.

Love that you can get a bowl with grilled chicken and multiple healthy options.  Prices seemed fair.  I had a Grilled Salmon \"extra protein was $3\" and I literally ended up with 2 full filets which was awesome!  Had brown rice and their Spivey teriyaki sauce.

Great lunch spot for sure.  Might try their sushi next time."}
{"text":"1st time here,  stumbled upon while driving by.  Absolutely
Absolutely loved how clean it was and the friendly staff.  
Sat outside on the patio.  
They offer many gluten free options including soy sauce. 
Will definitely be back.  Wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Plenty of selections from the menu (protein, veggies and sauce). There was a line to order bit it moved quickly. Service was okay, the cashier was a bit impatient because I was slightly confused with the menu. Ordered salmon and chicken for protein, rice & noodle for the carb, sweet potatoes & mushroom for veggies and teriyaki & curry sauce. My girls loved their dishes while for me it was just okay. Curry sauce was very bland and not spicy at all. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy alternative to fast food and found Tokyo Joe's, this might be my new favorite place!!!  Very clean inside, fast service and food delicious.  My son and I shared a California Roll, he had a curry shrimp and didn't really care for the curry but it was also the first time he ever had curry.  I had the teriyaki chicken with brow rice and veggies made with the stevia, very, very good.  Love they have about 5 different teas.  Everything was fresh.  The only thing I thought was kinda weird is they have no napkins out, you have to ask for them and then they give you one per person.  I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We have been here about 6 times.  The food quality is okay for the price but they've screwed up our orders more often than not.  The last time we went one of the employees was on Facebook and another was listening to headphones and neither seemed to care about helping customers at all.  It's almost as if there are no managers there or if they are, they are very ineffective and let the employees do whatever they want because anything seems to go at this place."}
{"text":"Really like the miso soup here. Their best sushi roll is the spicy tuna. I've been here 4 times now, and every single time the employees have been pretty rude. I don't expect anything over the top, but maybe just a \"hello\" or \"thank you\". They just seem pissed off and downright miserable."}
{"text":"I've tried Tokyo Joe's a few times now, and first, I have to say that their customer service is exceptional. Our server accidentally knocked over a container of sauce that splashed on the floor, and apologized profusely. Then to our surprise, she returns with a giftcard for a free entree. Wow!
The food itself is good for a fast casual restaurant, and fairly priced. We've tried a few different bowls now and left full and satisfied. What more can you ask for?

P.S. Love their peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Do not get take out!
All of us were very disappointed when we got this picked up for dinner tonight. We asked for extra sauce.. so they didn't put any in our actual bowls, so we had to mix it ourselves. My food was cold by the time it got here (under 10 minute drive) and was mostly udon noodles. They put in mostly noodles with a very small helping of my veggies and tofu (and forgot a veggie). Big disappointment compared to our first time trying it! 

We haven't yet decided whether we like or dislike Tokyo Joes.. When we ate in, the food was warm and had a generous helping of veggies and tofu, which means I actually had a nice ratio compared to my take out meal. 

The decor is modern and gorgeous, I LOVE the swirly lamps! The staff is very helpful with making your bowl perfect and lets you taste sauces, plus recommends fan favorites.

I guess another try will make up our minds for good - but I know we will not be doing take out again."}
{"text":"The place is neat and well decorated. The staff are pretty nice but don't look too happy to be there lol. I don't think I'll come back to this place again. I was coming in thinking it would be similar to genghis grill or something but it wasn't! It did not taste good at all. My steak udon bowl tasted sour and the veggies tasted like dirt. Seriously can taste the dirt each time you chewed into the veggies. This place has potential... Just not today lol"}
{"text":"Fast Casual Asian food, including plant based options,rice or noodle bowls, sushi and the like. We stopped by to take advantage of some freebies we had from their \"Addicts Club\" program. Monday  Night is BOGO free sushi. The food is quick and delicious, I got the cold fresh spring rolls and also did the \"Build Your Own Bowl\" with tofu in the regular size and I still had some to take home. We had a great first time experience and I am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The poke is a joke-y. There was so much sodium in this meal I literally had three bites. The food was not edible. The pieces of ahi and add-in avocado were microscopic. This was a horrible place to go after working out, especially when they market this place as healthy and it's everything but. My husband ordered a yakitori bowl. The noodles were so over cooked, they were falling apart and had no taste to them. We couldn't identify if the bowl had chicken because of how misshapen, tasteless and how questionable it looked. Our daughter's bento box wasn't any better. To top it off, it was overly pricey for food we couldn't even eat. This was our first and last time here. If you are looking for good, heathy, a reasonable price point Asian fusion place, head down the street to Foosia. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING HERE IS AWFUL. I have been here twice because I thought the first time was a fluke and maybe I just ordered the wrong meal. The second time I got soup and it had no flavor at all. I requested something else (I never return food), and they brought me a bento box which was subpar at best."}
{"text":"Really good food, quick, clean and many gluten free options! Highly recommend this place, would've given 5 stars if the staff was friendlier in talking to me about the GF options."}
{"text":"Build your bowl is a good option if you are hungry and want to eat healthy... Tofu with brown rice and plenty of veggies. Gluten free teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the 2nd was my last. My first try was okay, the food was enjoyable but I pre-ordered it for pick up so it wasn't so hot and fresh even though I picked it up at 1:09 pm and it was scheduled for 1:15 pm so I feel like it was rushed, The second time I ordered for pick up as well and it was also ready sooner than scheduled, this time I ordered a large because I was so hungry and they gave me 1 side of teriyaki sauce which wasnt enough to cover the whole bowl so I had to purchase an additional side! Not only this but mid way through I got a piece of chicken that was full of bone and cartilage. I.m sticking to a local for my teriyaki bowls going forward!"}
{"text":"The food is quick and easy and always consistent however nothing beats the amazing staff there. They are very friendly and recognize all the regulars that come in and what their orders Re.. this makes it 5 stars."}
{"text":"While not bad at all, this place is nothing unique or interesting and is far to expensive for what it is.  I ordered a MoJoe bowl and it was basically something one should expect from a premium item at Panda Express. My friend got General Joes soup. It was watery with a spicy aftertaste. The teriyaki sauce is standard. The sushi was decent, however. Might come back and try the ramen. 

Overall, meh."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I had 2 problems with my Joe's Original Teriyaki Bowl. I had white chicken with brown rice and the veggie mix. My broccoli tasted moldy...I thought it was just one floret, but the next one was so much worse I could not eat it, I had to use my napkin to dispose of it from my mouth. The other broccoli piece had a brown tinge to it, so I just avoided it in fear of experiencing that moldy flavor again. The rest of the bowl tasted fine and I thought okay maybe it is just a one off on the broccoli thing, and I continue on to the rest of the bowl. Then a minute later I take a bite and craaaccckk there is something hard and definitely not edible in my food apparently. I locate the item and it looks like a black jagged rock of some sort. I go to a worker and let them know what I found in my food and show her the small black piece that I bit down on (I was not expecting anything, ai just wanted to give them a heads up) her response was \"Oh, it must have been from the handle of one of our knives, that happens sometimes. Sorry.\" UM what!?! Get some better knives then that don't fall apart into people's food!!!!! I really wanted to like this place and am disappointed...on top of that my tooth still hurts from biting down on whatever that thing was. It was so busy in there and I had to get back to work, so I just left."}
{"text":"I give it 2 stars.....ONLY because the staff and service were good. You may rate it higher if you are fond of those frozen Healthy Choice bowls."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place every Friday since it's been open &normally would give it 5 stars since it's a somewhat healthy version of Asian food &love the choices &very tasty however this evening we (my 2 daughters &husband) were sadly disappointed... even though it was 15 minutes before closing I would think they'd still provide good service... i even asked if it was too late to order takeout &she said no... we get the same dishes every time yet tnite my bowl literally had NO rice in it &just a few vegetables(I asked for extra veggies since I'm vegan)...i was shocked & had to go home &cook rice to go with my handful of veggies! My daughter's Mahi was undercooked &her bowl also had very few veggies... there were about 4 other families eating in the restaurant so I know they couldn't of been closing up yet... hmm maybe the cook had a hot date &needed to get outta there or something... I've lived in this neighborhood 53 years &love town &country :) will I try it again? Yes... but just step up your game a bit, people!"}
{"text":"After hearing quite a few people talk about this place I finally got to try it. Yum! What an extensive menu. They have everything from sushi to poke bowls and salads. This time around I opted for a build your own bowl w udon noodles. Loved the variety of veggies they offered and the noodles were boiled just right. The husby was happy they had fresh jalapenos and was content w the chicken dish he ordered. 
The staff was beyond friendly, but I did question why they didn't have napkins easily available...You have to ask for them. Also, it wasn't very busy and yet we had to clear the table next to us so we weren't sitting next to dirty dishes on the four top we wanted to sit at. 
None-the-less, I'm definitely going to be coming back! Most likely on a Monday when they have buy 2 for 1 sushi, poke bowls or salad deals. Sweet!"}
{"text":"It is clean & bright with natural light, simple but smart decor. We eat here or take it home and it's been consistently good. Pretty friendly & patient staff too. Mike is a good guy, & helpful too.

Monday is an awesome deal starting at 4 pm, the .sushi & poke bowls are bogo ( buy one get one) Treat a friend and they'll keep you for life, ha.

3 weeks in a row Yo roll  8 pieces and a poke bowl with choices of fish and fruits, brown rice or greens. Nikko dressing so flavorful. I really enjoyed my meal both filling and satisfying. Cya next week."}
{"text":"I was planning on going to a different Poke place for dinner after making the rounds of the Goodwill stores on their half-price day but found myself several miles the opposite direction so I looked on Yelp and found this place was listed about halfway between the two stores I was going to. When I pulled up it didn't  look like the place was open because their windows are so dark it looked deserted. But then I saw a couple get out of their car and go in so I knew they must be open. They make the choosing fairly simple. You order at a counter and they give you a number to take to your table if you are eating in. I got the Poke bowl because that's what I went in there for. It was about $10.50 or so before tax. I was very impressed with the quantity I got and with the quality also. I got salmon with cucumbers and edamame mixed in and a brown rice base with traditional Hawaiian sauce. I was happy with my choices.  It was delicious.  I would have no problem going back there if I'm in the area again. I think I'm totally hooked on Poke now. 

The atmosphere is that of a fast food place and it looked extremely clean."}
{"text":"Heard SO many great things about this place as was excited to try! 
Ordered 3 four piece rolls, a build your own and a kids bento box. Service was completely un-engaged. They just kind of stared at us. It was out first time in and I was looking over the menu. I ordered the Arizona, Cali poke and one more. Ended up with a super dry cali roll and the 2 others. Saturated in sauce and seasoning. My son's salmon was just ok, the best thing was the noodles. The chicken serving in the bento box was so small, even I, a person who favors smaller portions, was shocked. $38 of definitely not worth it. I told them I got the cali instead of the cali poke and the guys said \"uh I wouldnt know the difference, Im
Sorry\" I didnt care to proceed w asking for a replacement and then I saw the sign on the table that said \"if youre not happy, let us know and we'll gladly trade your food for something you like\""}
{"text":"First, I have to thank Tokyo Joe's upper management for reaching out to me after my last review. They really want to make things right. I hope they address any review on Yelp that falls short of 4 stars. If they did that more their ratings would be higher (Sadly, almost all of their locations fall under the 4 star mark.) 

Let me start with a disclaimer by saying I have only had poke at Tokyo Joe's. So this review ONLY pertains to their poke bowls. 

The reason for my 3 star review before was because the kitchen couldn't seem to get my orders right. And I wasn't ordering anything out of the ordinary. I have been back two times since that last review and while things were not perfect the first time, this second go round it was. Unfortunately, they don't get 5 stars because of the incorrect order the last time I was here. 

Let me offer management some advice. I am an avid poke eater. I usually get it several times a month at different places. As of late, there has been a slew of poke places opening up; some are better than others. Is Tokyo Joe's one of the best? No, not currently. There is A LOT of competition in this market. I would urge them, if they haven't already, to sit down at their competitors' restaurants and order a bowl. There are a couple of places that really blow Joe's out of the water. Yes, they are a smidge more expensive. But I don't mind paying more if I get a good experience. Tokyo Joe's STILL needs to step up their game a little (like tone down the saltiness in the poke dressing, or add cilantro as a menu item).... I know... Joe's is more than poke, and I admit, I haven't tried anything else. But I will, because I plan on coming back to try other menu items.

I can't help it. I just LOVE poke! 

So who knows... Maybe a 5 star rating is still in the cards. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"My husband got the Sirloin Bento Box, it was $10.50(ish). He really enjoyed the steak, however was very disappointed with the portion size which left more to be desired for the price. I had several sushi rolls which were ok, the miso soup was good. We wanted to try this place out on a whim, now we know, and most likely will never return."}
{"text":"Did an order of take away sushi, nigiri and cucumber salad today on recommendation of a lifelong AZ resident. It's a LONG WAY from Tokyo and the ocean but provides basic sustenance in a streamlined setting. Wish I has seen the four flavors of brewed tea, may return to sample those."}
{"text":"The poke bowls are great! I get the grilled shrimp over mixed greens with mango, edamame and avocado. Hawaiian dressing. Garnished with sushi ginger, red pepper flakes and green onions. Easy to get to, solid service, great iced tea. It's a lunchtime staple"}
{"text":"This place is great for fast food so YES this is a 5 star fast food joint when we live in a society that swims in grease and sugar!

I LOVE that there are endless combinations and options. You can be as healthy or as naughty as you want and this place does meal prep for you if thats your thing -- they will customize to fit your caloric needs, macros, etc. Awesome! I went with the make your own bowl option. Went with white chicken (YAY thank you for spelling it out and giving the choice), brown rice, and pretty much all of their veggies sauced judiciously with their green dragon sauce. Oh and you can choose between a regular and a large size. Back to my bowl. I really enjoyed it. The chicken was cooked well, the rice was perfect and the veggies weren't overcooked. I really liked the green dragon sauce and they bill it as super spicy but I didn't think it was hot. I am a spicy butt as I have said in other reviews. They have all their nutritional values online which is awesome. Wish I had know that before because the green dragon was one of the most highly caloric sauces, not sure why though, so i would have picked something else. Prices are so reasonable. My only complaint is that this is the only location in the Valley. I would eat here weekly if there was one by my house. OH OH OH! And lest I forgot. ICED TEA game strong. Yay. Many different choices and fresh brewed. And for the boozer, they have beers."}
{"text":"Spent $19.00 (includes $2.00 tip) for a regular sized steak bowl with dragon sauce and an order of pan-grilled pot stickers. The 5 measly pot stickers were so soggy, they may as well been steamed. My steak bowl came without sauce but they did include one packet of sriracha. Was that the dragon sauce with which they speak???? There was a picture of a dragon on the packet.

I'll give it a few weeks and try again. But they have a lot of making up to do before I make this a regular lunch destination."}
{"text":"We got a build on your own bowl with steak, rice, veggies, teriyaki sauce, spicy tuna sushi, and a signature bowl. One was okay, build your own bowl was not great at all. Veggies seem like they came from a frozen veggie bag. Sushi was not good either. We didn't expect the best sushi ever from here but at least something decent. The sushi chef also seemed unhappy about getting a sushi order and voiced a few times to not send him anymore by 8:45 (we ordered at 8:20). I would recommend Thai Chili 2go cross the street, Chipotle, or Sushi Brokers to get your fix of similar food."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The food is really good and fresh.  Rob the cashier is really friendly and so is the rest of the staff! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Tokyo Joes was at this location. The staff are very friendly and the food is phenomenal. The portions are huge, my gf took half of her regular salmon bowl home. 
Very good food, quite healthy and overall nice establishment."}
{"text":"First timers and we will definitely return. We ordered two build-your-own bowls, Gyoza, and spring rolls. Gyoza could be filled more but good. Spring roll wrappers were a bit chewy but great taste and the peanut sauce was good! Good first time experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a soup and a chicken teriyaki bowl. All the food was okay. I only got to go so I couldn't tell you about the service or environment of the inside of the store I didn't stay too long. But the employee that was taken my order was very helpful and telling me what are their specials."}
{"text":"Very impressed and a great addition to the Camelback corridor. Many healthy selections, the bowls are creative and offer something for a variety of tastes. Many drink selections, soft drinks, teas. Affordable Asian fusion with healthy selections."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The teriyaki chicken is not grilled like other places. Very bland . Sauce is weak."}
{"text":"Waited a long time for take out only to get hard, dry chicken and stale rice. Ordered 3 different bowls and no one liked any of them and no one finished any of them. Teriyaki sauce tastes nothing like teriyaki sauce. Based on other reviews, I'm thinking this may have been an off night but none the less, warranted a review given our total disappointment."}
{"text":"So it's a very nice place to eat but very \"fast food\" like with all the trimmings.. cramped space if you dine in.. ridiculously parking.. I can only imagine all the car crashes and bumper near misses.. It's one of those places I would go to only if I saw the parking lot empty.. Too much stress getting in and out of the area when the food is only a 4-5 on a scale of 1-10. Very nice try but poor location if your on the fly trying to get in and out on a Friday at 5pm."}
{"text":"A Saturday night visit. The store was 50% full. Order was made at 7:38 pm for dine in and it took 38 minutes to receive 2 chicken bowls. Food is good, I can make this myself at home though. The cashier missed one of my veggies. First and last time for this location. Maybe I will try another location as this store has a BIG issue in its order to kitchen operation."}
{"text":"Rarely do you find a place that is healthy AND delicious! This place nails both those adjectives. I always get the create your bowl option. There's a huge selection of fresh vegetables to add to your bowl, the sweet potatoes or brown rice are always moist and tasty, and the protein selection is great too(mostly healthier options). I'll continue to come back here and I always tell my employees to swing by during lunch time! Oh and service is always 5-star, so no complaints at all about this place!"}
{"text":"This place was decent... probably won't come again. I had literally 2 pieces of broccoli in my bowl. The girl at the counter didn't really seem to enjoy anyone's company."}
{"text":"We had never heard of this place before so we decided to stop in for a late lunch earlier this week. So glad we did! It is an \"order at the counter and pay first\" place. After ordering they give you a number and bring your food to your table. One criticism right off the bat is that there are so many options to choose from but you can't begin to select them until you are right up at the counter. They need to have a menu further back or little paper menus available to review before you get in line. We decided to  try their Shrimp Spring Rolls as they are one of my favorite Asian appetizers. I was not disappointed at all. I love the fact that they were filled with just the good stuff (greens, shrimp, carrots, and avocado) and none of the normal rice noodles that just tend to fill me up. They were served with two different dipping sauces. One was your traditional peanut sauce and it was OK but my favorite was the soy ginger sauce. I ordered the tuna poke bowl with brown rice. I selected edamame, avocado, and cucumber as my pairings. The dressing I selected was their Nikko dressing, which is a very light and refreshing soy ginger dressing. I then topped it off with wonton chips, fresh ginger, and green onions. I have to say that it was totally delicious! It tasted so fresh and healthy. And with so many options and variations I could eat at this place every day for a week or more and not get tired of it! Hubby got pretty much the same thing as me with the traditional Hawaiian dressing and opted for the sweet onions instead of the avocado. It was tasty too! They have a serve yourself beverage area with a wide selection of iced teas. Service was fairly fast and the gal that took our order was extremely bubbly and excited to tell us about their \"Addict Club\" in which you collect points for dining in order to get free stuff as well as the buy one get one free sushi on Mondays after 4 PM. The bathrooms were clean however hubby said the men's room did not have any paper towels. I definitely see this place becoming a regular of ours and hopefully one will open up closer downtown by my work!"}
{"text":"I tried this place today, ordered yakitori bowl, just like the other review, noodles like spaghetti. For the price I paid for the meal, not worth it, bowl was half way filled. Will not come back again!"}
{"text":"I went to this place once out of curiosity. Wasn't impressed with my poke bowl AT ALL. 
So this is my second time trying this place out because I always give second chances! 

I ordered the oyako bowl this time. It was expensive and honestly I could of cooked it way better! Had zero taste....really! The plain unseasoned poached egg in my dish had the most flavor. 

They also asked if I wanted white or dark chicken meat. 
'White'
because duh. I don't want dark. Apparently they charge you an extra $0.75 for non-dark chicken. (The menu or the staff said nothing of the sort) 

And P.S. They gave me dark meat anyway!....

So a really really small bland bowl made mostly with rice for $9.25 (including tax). I'll pass. 

Really I should have just gotten the d*** In-and-out or Taco Bell. Would have been way cheaper and more delicious. :O"}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  Second time was better.  Did the \"Build Your Own\" bowl with Teriyaki sauce, chicken breast, rice, broccoli, carrots and zucchini.  The pricing is fair.  No complaints.  My first visit after they initially opened would have been a 3.  They were still working the kinks out."}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright. Service was great though. Every staff was pleasant and helpful and make sure we were taken care of. I had the Joe's roll and thought that was good. Also, had the steak bowl with mushrooms and spinach. It was ok. Might need to give it a second try."}
{"text":"This was just my second time here in a year, the first was just a mildly unsatisfying bento box.  Today I was craving ramen and sushi so I went here.  The sushi roll was decent.  The cashier seemed to be high on something, she barely spoke or greeted anyone and spent her time dancing in her own head. I ordered a build your own bowl that turned out disgusting. I barely ate half of this over-priced bowl.  I don't know if it was the broth or the chicken, but the combo with the noodles was flat out disgusting.  DON'T EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I give one star for cleanliness. Place was empty when we walked in. I was hungry so thought why not? The cashier was not vey friendly or helpful. The General Joes soup bowl was okay but too much Ginger. Cali Roll was fishy and didn't like the cream cheese. Fry's Food store makes better. Chicken Spring Rolls would be good if you could actually eat the wrapper. It was like chewing rubber. Won't go back. Inexpensive but not worth it."}
{"text":"Normally when I order here it is FANTASTIC today however was much much different. I feel that it was not fresh (I ordered right at opening) the avocado was brown and the shrimp still had its shell in random parts of the roll causing me to have to unwrap most of it to remove it and it had a fishy smell where it normally doesn't."}
{"text":"Had sushi and poke bowls (both salmon and tuna). Sushi was similar to what you would expect at a grocery store (pretty sure it was pre-made... dense, unpalatable rice). Poke bowls tasted good, but are very small with not a lot of fish."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but the only thing that is good here is the coke soda, i have been waiting for this restaurant to be open , but I was disappointed, the food is not good. I ordered the ramen chicken, salmon with rice and veggie , and miso soup which I find it very salty . Pls improve all your dishes if you want me to come back"}
{"text":"I can't really say too much but the food was ok. I have been to other teriyaki places and had better. I thought the sauce was a little over powering from the bowl I got. It's a nice clean restaurant and very clean but I would rather go to another place for a teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"I got the Mahi Mahi bowl, which would have been more correctly called the Dessert Tuna bowl. It was drenched in teriyaki sauce and covered it in mango."}
{"text":"My husband was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and I eat gluten free as well.  This is one of only a couple restaurants that offer gluten free sushi.  We were very excited when we found this place, as we only live about a mile away.  The food is decent and prices are inexpensive.  On Mondays they offer 2 for 1 sushi rolls- a lot of food for a great price!!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Tokyo Joe's. wife got the MoJo bowl and i got a Bento box. Now that I'm home, let me expand on this. The sub-text under the Tokyo Joe's sign reads \"Healthy Asian...\". They mean it! The vegetables were fresh. There didn't seem to be an over use of sugars or salts in the food prep. Portions were reasonable and we were able to sample something that we were not aware of on the menu.

I have to admit that the night we went, there was a pretty good rainstorm coming down. That didn't stop folks from coming in. Since I have to watch carbs, it was REALLY easy to customize my box for that. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was comfortable and well appointed to the theme of modern Asian. Seating is easy on the body and if you want a wonderful view of the Estrella Mountain Park, ...you have your view."}
{"text":"Just happen to stop in and really enjoyed my meal. Spring rolls were incredible! The Nikko salad was a perfect blend of fresh avocado peppers almonds Spring greens Mandarin oranges and chicken breast. I also had the miso soup I just couldn't stop eating their food. All very yummy, service was fast and the manager was really helpful with helping me with my choices. I am really happy we just happen to stop in and it will not be my last visit."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is here. Sushi blah. Menu choices small. We got our food in decent time which I was worried about after reading other reviews. What bothered me most was customer service. To be exact the girl who took our order not the guy walking around delivering food, he was good. She seemed bothered at questions that we asked and for the love of she would NOT STAND UP STRAIGHT!! At first I thought maybe she is injured and has too lean. Ok but when I watched her walk around she seemed fine. While taking another order ...there she goes again! Leaning on the counter as if she was to busy to be here doing her job or was bored. What happened to customer service? The selection of teas was abundant and I was excited to taste them. EVERY ONE  of them was bitter and BLAH! Ended up with water. Only reason I gave two stars was the one gentleman that delivered our food was nice and cheerful like he wanted to be there, and checked on us And food was just ok definitely not great experience. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Fast, casual, clean Asian food. 

Great for a quick lunch or casual dinner. 

Went tonight for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The food tasted fresh, was clean (not heavy with sauces), and flavorful. The portions were great, especially for the price. I had the Yakitori bowl. Was a little surprised that their \"ramen\" was thicker noodles than I expected (was expecting top ramen noodles), but it was delicious nonetheless. My daughter got the kids bento box and it was great. Again, super clean yet flavorful. Nice mix of protein, vegetables, carbs, and even a cookie for dessert. And they had milk for kids included. Definitely patent approved. 

The service was great too! The cashier guy was super friendly and helpful. 

I will definitely be returning to try more things off the menu!"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty food your way. Liked everything we tried and service was great the person at the register was very helpful.  Totally coming back they have different specials everyday Monday is the sushi special"}
{"text":"I was shopping at Nordstrom Rack and noticed Tokyo Joes and thought \"I would love a teriyaki bowl\". When we walked in, it was surprisingly more modern than the average fast food Asian restaurants but the concept is very similar. You can pick your protein, carbs, vegetable, sauce...

I like that they had gluten free teriyaki sauce and it wasn't bad! However, when they delivered my bowl, it looked pretty sad mainly because there wasn't that much meat (I got steak) or vegetables. The steak was also very rough and dry so I guess if you drench your bowl with sauce, the dryness goes away. 

It was inexpensive - less than $10 for the regular size, but I don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The restaurant is fairly new in the area and so far I have been only twice. The first time I wasn't sure what to get so I got the make your own bowl. I had no clue what sauce to get and I asked if I could try them all and they did! They were very nice about it too and did not rush me either which I totally appreciate. The food was good but it wasn't exceptional. THEN I went again and got the bowl with the steak and shrimp and it was delicious! Both times that I've gone the customer service was great, the area is always clean including the restrooms, and the food comes fast which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Clean environment and helpful staff.  Took us a bit to order as this was our first visit.  I choose  the MoJoe which comes with dark chicken sautéed with pineapple, egg, carrots, sweet onion, green onion, red pepper in a sweet and spicy sauce with white rice.  Hubby ordered the build your own bowls with dark chicken, white rice, spicy hockey sauce, broccoli, snap peas, edamame, spinach and water chestnuts.  Service was quick.  Hubby thought his chicken was dry.  I my dish had some chunks of chicken and shredded chicken which I didn't care for,  The flavoring was good though.  Casual dining and plenty of parking"}
{"text":"Moved from California a few months ago, wife and I decided on some poke and sushi, maybe my expectations were too high, but the food was not great at all, we had the California roll, a salmon poke bowl, and a ramen soup, all for an expensive $35!!! At its best they slap fish and rice together and call it sushi, more like supermarket sushi, the ramen was super bland, and the California roll tasted very very weird. I'm not trying to be so negative, but if you are gonna charge $35 at least serve some decent food.....

We won't be back, I'm sorry"}
{"text":"I love tokyo joes! I come here I at least once aweek! So happy they opened out here in Az! Used to go in Colorado all the time when I lived there. My favorite it the boulder bowl with yakitori! I could eat it everyday! The food is fast and fresh and amazingly good for you! No fillers, or weird things you can't pronounce.  The portions are very filling. Everytime I go, they give us fast and very friendly and peronalized service. I don't think ive ever had to wait longer than 7 minutes for our order, and it is normally even less.  Employees are always very nice and seem genuinely happy to be there. They have learned my name and say hi to me by name now! The one time there was a tiny problem with my order, they comped us a whole meal to make it right. I love Tokyo Joes and am so happy they are here. Their yakitori sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Tokyo Joes, I will drive here even though there is one closer to where I live simply because the people at the Chandler location are friendly and good at what they do.  I have a dietary restriction which the folks here take seriously which I appreciate.  The food is pretty good and reasonably priced, the restaurant is clean and atmosphere is casual.  They are pretty quick to get food out too."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: delicious food, decent pricing, service is 'meh' - not rude but definitely inattentive. Seems like they're bored. 

What I got: dark chicken protein bowl with brown rice, peanut sauce, and the no brainier veggie mix + mushrooms. 

The peanut sauce is surprisingly good - not what I expected that's for sure. I probably should have added bean sprouts. All in all the taste of my bowl was great. 

I wish the customer service experience was a little more embracing."}
{"text":"A friend eats here every day so I thought I'd try it. The teriyaki was horrible. The meat was rubbery, the vegetables were not even slightly steamed (the broccoli was raw) and their sauce tasted strange. I won't return."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. The service is horrible. I ordered a meal for dine-in and was treated like I offended them by my mere presence. The person that was bringing the food to guess didn't think I needed napkins or utensils. Strangely enough, she did feel compelled to bring everyone else before and after me theirs though, which I was odd. She even managed to be friendly to others while I she refused to even acknowledge me, until she dropped my bowl on the table and hurried away.

In terms of the actual food, the sushi was made with rice that tasted like it had been cooked, reheated, cooked, reheated and cooked again.

I wanted to give this place a chance but after my last three visitis, I'm done."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for our first time today and found quite a little tasty treasure!  We both had the white chicken/brown rice bowl and both really enjoyed it!  The chicken was about the most tender I've ever had in a restaurant!

You get to add 5 veggies to your bowl and also pick your sauce. All our veggie choices were EXTREMELY well cooked, and VERY fresh!

We will definitely be coming back, and will have friends and family in tow!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out and about with our two youngest when we happened upon this place. We decided to check it out. Wow! Am I glad we did. 
     I did the Build Your Own Bowl and had tofu, no carb option (twice the veggies), with the green curry sauce. The tofu is organic non-GMO and everything I ordered was vegetarian. It was incredible! Fresh veggies, perfectly grilled tofu, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful. 
   My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad. He was very happy with the flavors.
   My son (22 months) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles. The kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges. My son had the oranges. It also comes with a drink. My infant daughter passed on the food. ;-)
  It's a sit down/take out place. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The service is speedy and the prices are good.
   We were able to eat a delicious, healthy meal for about $20 for all of us. In a country where fast food has become a staple in many people's diet, Tokyo Joe's is a breath of fresh air. 
   If you eat meat you're covered. Pescatarian? They have fish. Vegetarian?  No problem. 
    I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites when in Colorado so I am so happy to see one in my neighborhood. The Yakitori sauce is so yummy. Staff was friendly and helpful. Food lived up to what I've had before. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Sushi: good. Salmon: good. Veggies: GOOOOD! I first had Tokyo Joe's in Colorado so was extremely excited that we started to see them pop up in the valley. It's not the best food that I have ever had but for the price point it's pretty good. I tend to swing in at lunch and enjoy the bento box options a lot. 

Make sure to get the curry sauce on the salmon and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"This is 2nd time here, first time it was not good so  
I went back to see if its changed but same situation, food is just bland and tasteless!"}
{"text":"Good first impression. The food here isn't like those classy sushi restaurants that I have been to. My first time here was meeting with old friends and our time dining here was good and satisfying one. Would go for another try if am able."}
{"text":"My first time there was exceptionally good. The service was good, no complaints there. I was skeptical at first but once I received my food I was taken aback by the appearance and how delicious it looked. I had gotten the build your own bowl with many elements, all which were really good especially together. I definitely recommend this place for anyone willing to try new things."}
{"text":"We LOVE Tokyo Joes. Literally cannot get enough! My husband always gets the \"big\" bowl of teriyaki with double chicken and I have almost tried everything. My new favorite is the Bento box with steak, edamame and spicy tuna rolls. Their GM, Louis, makes each visit even more special-he's so nice and professional. Always remembers us with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Meh...nothing special. We had the spicy teriyaki chicken. The flavor was strange. I did enjoy the miso soup though!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat after work. Casual dine in or take out. Protein bowls are awesome."}
{"text":"My boss just took me here for lunch 12/12/14  and the interior decor is very cool.
I got the mahi tuna bowl with udon noodles. 
Very tastey and well presented with a small fresh salad in the bowl.
They also have a mini sushi bar.
Best to figure 10.00 a person with small drink.
Go try it!  You'll be surprised!"}
{"text":"Ive been here on several occasions and have tried the Yakitori bowl(which is pretty good, I especially enjoyed the sauce), I also have had the Traditional Oyako with noodles which was my favorite that is until yesterday I tried the Mahi-Mahi bowl with white rice which is now my favorite. I also regularly get the chicken spring rolls with the soy ginger sauce. But I still have more things to try. I would try one of these bowls if you first try it."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but left disappointed . The quality of ingredients is not good . I would describe it as over priced knock off Asian fast food ."}
{"text":"Tried this place after having heard good things from friends. To start off I'll just say for the price to quantity of food is off. I think it's over priced. I would rather spend my money at pei Wei where the food has more flavor and is of a higher quality. The noodles and everything else in my bowl seemed very bland. I do admit the chicken had good flavor and was moist. There also was a lack of vegetables in my bowl. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Denver based companies have risen in the valley again!!

Seriously, LOVE me some TJ's.They offer great, healthy options (for real though, check out the nutrition facts on the website) and best of all, it's veggie-saur paradise, complete with rice, all the veggies you can fit into a bowl and even tofu. And the good kind of firm tofu.

If you haven't been in yet, get your booty in here...te service is FAST and friendly. Oh and they even offer freshly made sushi right before your very eyes if you're into that sort of thing.

And, bonus, they have four types of freshly brewed tea!

See you at TJ's!"}
{"text":"Mmm there are many places that offer \"clean eating \" with more flavor.  Their sauce is ... Just weak , no flavor :( so sad because I would love a healthy yummy option near here .   

2 stars came only from good service , manager and servers were very pleasing just my tummy was not pleased .  

Also their \"side\" veg option sucks , it's just one Huuuge order of same plain veg.   Needs mixing up option.  And people , huge loads of white rice is never the best \"clean\" food lol"}
{"text":"Okay some points to note: I was looking specifically for a cheap sushi place (since they closed my How Do You Roll!!), so if you want high quality, authentic stuff, this is not the review for you. We came in on Sunday lunchtime, and this location is relatively new.
My boyfriend and I enjoyed this place, and we will probably be back. I had the Yo sushi rolls, and he had a large MoJoe bowl. He thought the bowl was good, though I felt like it had a little too much sauce for my taste. The sushi was freshly made, not boxed or buffet.This roll had tuna, salmon, avocado and mango: the mango and avocado were fresh and ripe (not hard) and had good flavor. However, the fish was not very flavorful, and the rice was bland too, though most rice doesn't have strong flavor anyway. But despite the blandness, I would recommend it over some other fast food places I've had. The price I thought was good, about $6 for 8 pc - I almost got their pack of 4 rolls with 2 nigiri, just for more variety, for $10.
Atmosphere was nice for basically a fast food place, and the wifi seemed to work well on his phone though we did not get our laptops out today (I didn't see any plug outlets though). I will say there were three people working, and it took a while for the tables to get bussed. Most tables and the bar by the windows had used bowls when we walked in, and we were done with our food by the time the guy came round to collect them. However, I am pretty sure this was due to it being Sunday (there were a number of people there despite the day), and they were pretty quick with bringing out the food, so serving before bussing was probably their priority.
Can't wait for cooler weather to try out the patio!"}
{"text":"I was told that they were closing early because they were going to a Christmas party. I went ahead and ordered my food and the young gentleman behind the counter said do you want me to put it in a takeout Bowl, I told him that will eat here. 

That's when the gentleman behind the counter said that some people are quicker eaters than others

This generally made me feel that the entire crew including the shift manager was more concerned about getting out of the store closed down. So they could go to the Christmas party, then providing excellent customer service to the customers that were walking in the door

I definitely do not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"My new go to Sushi/Ramen place. Monday is BOGO for sushi rolls and they have a great selection to choose from on the menu. The ramen bowl is very comforting and savory, the broth is flavorful and the fresh ingredients take it to another level. I built my own Poke Bowl and they use real crab which is a plus. They have a variety of toppings and dressings that make everything come together. The prices are very reasonable compared to other places in the same area and the amount of food you get is great. The service is always friendly and they will help guide you if it's your first time there. Excellent flavor."}
{"text":"We tried them out and were pleasantly surprised at the awesome presentation of the food. Everything tasted and looked fresh. Plus the kids enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This food chain, is now added to my favorite food places to. The people are super friendly and professional. The restaurant is always clean and boasts a modern atmosphere. I even heard this restaurant mention on the JohnJay and Rich show. The loyal card also have awesome benefits, too. From free drinks to entries, it encourage me to bring a friend to enjoy the Japanese culture infused food. Although the  food is fast, it is healthy. Similar to what Chipotle did for Mexican fast food, Tokyo Joe's is doing for Japanese cuisine. on't forget to pick an Addict card, because after the first visit you will become one."}
{"text":"I ordered the bento box with half chicken and half steak. Chicken box is suppose to be 9.95 and steak a dollar more. They charged me an extra $3 just bc i wanted half and half. I then asked for teriyaki sauce on the food and peanut sauce on the side but only got the peanut sauce on the side with no teriyaki sauce on my food. The quality of the food wasn't anything special and to be honest more toward the lower end. Sushi that came with the bento box was not good at all. I'm only giving two stars because the guy in the front who took my order was extremely nice and apologetic. So 0 stars for the food and price but felt welcome and nice service. If you are thinking about lunch the lunch boat and other lunch options at Benihana are far better quality for the same price, if not a couple bucks more. I probably would not come here again to be honest."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for lunch, We checked out their menu before ordering. Walked to the front counter and the white chick that was taking our order didn't seem friendly at all. When I asked her what was in the side salad, she struggled to tell me. So I cut her off after she listed the 2nd ingredient and said nvm bc I didn't want to wait 5 mins for her to figure it out in case she didn't know. Soooo If your the first person everyone approaches, you should Sorta know your menu in case. But it's whatever. 

Anyways, Fiancé got the joes original bowl which came  chicken, teriyaki sauce, rice and steam veggies. I got myself a bento box and my son too. We were enjoying our meal. Everything tasted fine except rice was a bit hard but it was edible. So both of us was satisfy with our meal. 

Then the worst part, got into our car to get some boba at TeaBo \" check them out, delicious food & drinks\" anyways we was driving to the boba place and I began to feel so weird like I was high or drug. Felt so light headed and stomach was acting up. Idk what happen, but something didn't feel right . So I'm def staying away from that place. Felt much better after I got home.  

Not trying to be a rude reviewer but I'm just stating the truth and my experience for others to know before going. I never ever get sick from food. Very rare. Probably cross contamination or something . Anyways, it's a cute place and all."}
{"text":"We had a VERY bad experience eating here for the first time. It almost seemed like nothing went right.

The service: During the course of our meal, the waitress got two of our orders wrong and mouthed off to me when I politely asked her to correct the mistake. She then proceded to complain about us to the sushi bar employee (specifically calling our table \"those vegetarians\"). The sushi bar employee then complained about our table to another waitress. I complained to the manager, Courtney, about this poor service and she was nice enough to give us three \"I'm Sorry\" free meals. Thank you, Courtney! You were the highlight of our overall frustrating experience.

The Food: everything was bland, watery, and burnt. The sauce didn't even have flavor. The aftermath of this is that we all feel like we are going to puke (including the meat-eaters in our parties).

Cleanliness: one of the waitresses spilled a drink on my mother and father (and their food). She was very nice and apologized for it, but then it took the entirety of our meal for anyone to clean it up. And we had to ask for napkins and for them to replace our meals.

Supplies: there were no lids for the To-Go cups.

Overall, this was a very poor experience. Even though we got free meals, we will not be returning. At least we have a funny tale to tell about the worst Father's Day meal we've ever experienced."}
{"text":"They water down their soy sauce, their avocado was unripe... sushi is not superior to any other place either"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive but not overwhelming.  There are a lot of choices for how you want the food prepared.  Bento box is where you choose your meat,
sauce, pairings, dressing and toppings. Very clean place and bathrooms. Many healthy teas and fountain drinks. Didn't try the \"made to order sushi\" but it looked yummy. I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Tokyo Joe's for a while now. I viewed the menu online before going to make sure they had soy free options. This is a cute asian diner, there is ample indoor and outdoor seating. The restaurant is bright and clean.
When you walk in you place your order at the counter, you are given a number and they bring your order to your table.
They have a variety of menu options ranging from appetizers, sushi rolls, wraps, salads, bowls, build your own bowls, bento boxes, a variety of sauces from mild to spicy, and a variety of sodas, teas, bottled water and juices.
I opted for the build-your-own bowl. They have regular or large bowls. I chose the regular size bowl, I chose the grilled white chicken, and their low carb option of double vegetables. There are a variety of veggies to choose from.  I chose broccoli, snap peas and carrots. I did not try any sauce as there were only two soy-free options, and one was really spicy and the other had coconut(which I can't have either). So needless to say my bowl was a little bland, but that was due to my opting out of sauce. The chicken was grilled perfectly, and the veggies I felt were over steamed, but overall good. I also tried their sweet tea. It was good, not too sweet, as that can be a problem at other places.
The atmosphere was upbeat, the staff was friendly and helpful, and overall it was a good experience. I will be back to Tokyo Joe's :)."}
{"text":"Kinda slow service for an empty restaurant on Sunday at 5pm. Service was ok. Sushi was ok. Am I coming back? Probably not... I'll rather try somewhere else first."}
{"text":"My go to food place when I'm at home.   I order on the mobile app and pick up in less than 10 minutes.  Food is great and pretty healthy depending on what you get. My husband didn't have a good experience when he dined in for the first time but has since changed his mind once I ordered for him.  Lol!"}
{"text":"Great healthy lunch spot in PHX."}
{"text":"We have been here probably 25 times, mostly lunch with some dinners.  Our favorite spot for great rice bowls and sushi rolls.  I haven't ordered a salad, but they look good.  Love the customizable bowl menu with light or dark chicken, beef, salmon, tofu, fresh vegetables (you select), and many sauce options.  Great sushi rolls are made fresh and nicely presented with choice of 4 or 8-pieces.  Fountain drinks include a variety of great iced teas.  Service has been wonderful each visit so far."}
{"text":"So I got a message from the manager after my experience here saying how sorry they were and would address it to the team. Lucky for me they sent us 2 free dinner vouchers this is great to me. That shows how much they want you to come back so they could make it right next time.  Now when I use the vouchers I'll update my review again with my experience. Thank you to the kind manager for taking the time to make us happy enough to come back! We shall see if the team listens on treats us not so poor this next time around. Upping one star for the good management."}
{"text":"So excited to have this open near work! I love the bowl with chicken (double meat) with white rice, stevi-yaki (bonus for having this option) & crispy onions with egg! They have a variety of options for vegetables and the bowls are pure and good! I don't worry about sodium or sugar levels, just good ole carbs and protein. 

The staff is very courteous and the manager does a great job! 

It's simple with a great price point, will be back & back again!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Me an my husband came to this location to check out the menu. We took forever ordering but the server was patient and helpful with us. My husband ending up ordering something that he didn't know would be raw the manager was nice enough to substitute it for us free of charge! I'll be back to this location again, for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here after my parents raved about this place...calling it the best sushi joint ever (they never had actual sushi unless you think crab wontons are sushi). Although their crab wontons were really good, the rest of the sushi I got wasn't all that good. The joes roll was not very tasty but none of my sushi selections tasted disgusting. The reason I give this location a three star is entirely because of their customer service. The lady behind the counter was very polite and she helped my wife and I make selections for my son who is allergic to pretty much everything. I'd go there again but won't ever get sushi again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been here about half a dozen times in the last few weeks. GREAT alternative to fast food. Many healthy options and I love that you can customize your bowls and salads. Tokyo Joe's is like the Chipotle of Japanese food (in a good way!). I love that they put the sauces on the side and give you the option to do double veggies instead of rice or noodles. You can really be in control of the calories that you are consuming here. Sushi is pretty good. Not outstanding but good nonetheless . My favorites are the peanut skewers, crab cheese wonton roll, Yakitori bowl, Ichigo salad and the unsweetened pomegranate green tea. They advertise no MSG, all natural proteins, wild seafood, and organic produce where possible which makes this place even more appealing. Staff has always been friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is always clean and neat. Great option for a quick and healthy bite to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tuna tataki salad and chicken spring rolls are amazing. If you're looking for fresh Asian food with delicious vegetarian options, you'll be glad you stopped in to try it. I recently had the tuna poke and nearly fell out of my seat it was so good."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place being right across the street from where I work I thought it would be so convenient. I order the dark meat chicken teriyaki bowl with ramen noodles instead of rice. The noodles were not what I expected. It was watery and bland. I can say the ordering experience was super easy and convenient, you can order online and pay and just go and pick it up without waiting in line. Maybe there are other dishes that don't taste so bad."}
{"text":"Spent $24 for a Oyako signature bowl and a build your own poke bowl. The Oyako bowl was bland (I barely tasted a hint of the broth) and the dark meat was tough. The poke bowl we ordered was spicy (and I tolerate siracha like ketchup)! It was ordered with items that you wouldn't even consider spicy (salmon, edamame, pineapple, mango,mixed greens, and wonton strips). There were no jalapenos accidentally thrown in there, so the only thing I could imagine it to be was the Hawaiian sauce dressing. Last time I checked, Hawaiian sauce is more along the lines of being sweet (with maybe a little spicy undertone--which is fine with me). This was unbearably tangy and spicy. I can't speak for the sushi rolls, but at this point, I'd rather hit up the sushi spot down the road instead."}
{"text":"These guys need to work on their customer service and supply chain. Maybe don't ask me to wait as I stand in line and take a massive phone order which now puts me in the back of the line."}
{"text":"So I waited to try this place out, because I wanted to experience it once the kinks were worked out. My boyfriend & I went there for the 1st time last night- we both opted for the build your own bowls. I order a regular size 1/2 chicken, 1/2 steak, with all the veggies, udon noodles, & a spicy peanut sauce. I also ordered a side of spring rolls.

I was very disappointed with the quality of the meat in my bowl. I asked for all white chicken & I received both dark & light. The steak, & I hate saying this, was something I should have fed to my dog. The veggies were cooked well, still had some crunch to them. However the onions on the bowl were raw. The sauce did not taste spicy or like peanuts. The noodles were very watery. 

The spring rolls however were very good! Overall for $14.00, it was not worth it. The quality, & taste was just not good. I should have went to Zoe's or Chipotle, but next time I know that if I am looking for a better, casual dinning option for dinner, I will go else where.

It is a shame, because I really wanted to like this place & was excited to try it, because it had good Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"the food is pretty good, but i swear they are killing the chicken & plucking it in the kitchen or something because both times we've come here it's taken FOREVER!!! The first time I figured it was just because they were pretty busy, but today it took 51 mins before we got our food! Thats a longer wait than a normal restaurant! Hopefully in the future they can get their prep times down,because we have been waiting for a place like this!"}
{"text":"If high quality, healthy food at affordable prices is what you're looking for look no further.  This is a nice addition to Arizona as it combines all of the things you love about Chipotle (fast service, streamlined menu, quality ingredients) with what you love about asian cuisine (ramen, sushi).  The value is great as they have monthly specials which currently include a $9 combo of a big bowl of ramen, half a sushi roll, and a drink.  When you join their online club you'll get additional specials like free starters or BOGO meals on specified days.  The food itself is very tasty and the sushi was better than I expected with some interesting roll creations.  

They're definitely still working out the kinks of a new staff but the management has been very good each time I've been.  On my last visit the manager came over and apologized profusely for us waiting a long time for our food and made things right.  It might have been the difference between us coming back or not and she did a great job.  

If you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner and haven't been here yet, definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Disappointing!! I love the Tokyo Joes in Phoenix but this one was sad. The employees do not know the menu. I asked if I can get the spicy tuna without aioli and they had to ask each other and after three of them had a conversation and still couldn't figure it out I just ordered something else. My salmon bowl with veggies was cold and the salmon under cooked. I ordered extra sauce and instead got no sauce. There were also veggies I didn't order in my bowl and the veggie distribution was all wrong. Imagine like five whole carrots and one tiny sliver of onion. Also got no sesame seeds. I probably won't return. I'm going to stick with the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Best fast food in phx. Salmon and veggies and fresh and sauces are flavorful. Employees are very nice and good comes quick. I like the iced tea with stevia. Please open a N Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Just tried their traditional chicken bowl.  Very good, cheap and fast option for lunch.  Outdoor seating is pretty well shaded nut there's plenty of seating inside as well."}
{"text":"Clean.  Tasty food with healthy options. First visit here and I have to say I'm impressed.  I could have used a few more veggies and less brown rice in my veggie bowel but next time I'll ask for that."}
{"text":"Have been to this location several times since it has opened. Food is always fresh, app orders always have been correct and ready on time. Staff is helpful and friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone. Awesome sushi specials on Monday."}
{"text":"Worse than if  McDonald's made Chinese food...gas station sushi is better than what they pass off as sushi here...DO NOT ENTER!!"}
{"text":"So the food was just alright for my boyfriend and myself. I think Genghis Grill has better noodle combinations. The sushi was very plain and overpriced. My daughter loved her bento box and it had the right amount of food for her which is why it is getting three stars. The staff was not helpful and when we asked for additional serving items they never came to deliver them."}
{"text":"There is definitely room for improvement but overall we're not too disappointed.

We stopped at Tokyo Joe's today for lunch and both got the Mahi Mahi Bowl with udon noodles and the Arizona sushi roll. 
We were both very pleased with the bowls, the fish was cooked very well, it had lots of delicious sauce and the noodles were great. It fell very short on the vegetables though. You can double your veggies for $2 more but 2x0 still equals 0. 

The sushi was a major fail, unfortunately. It was spicy but otherwise completely lacked flavor except for the vinegar, so eating it felt like chewing on rubbery rice dipped in jalapeño pickle juice. Definitely not ordering that again.

The staff was friendly, as you order at the counter and then sit down until someone brings your food there's not much \"service\", but cashier and waiter were very polite.

All in all a good place to go for the bowls, would definitely be better if they had more vegetables. Can not recommend it for the sushi though."}
{"text":"The sushi ahi poke bowl is to die for! A little expensive, but a great protein filled meal and fairly guilt free. Fish tasted very fresh too. 

I cannot say the same about the crab meat that was in one of the sushi rolls that we got, not very good."}
{"text":"With Tokyo Joe's just opening up on 30-May-2014, they were doing a wonderful job in QSC, but the food coming out of the kitchen was running very SLOW! Placed my order for (2) two sets, one being a large California roll, and had the Tokyo Joe set which had grilled shrimp in it. FOOD WAS AWESOME!!! Due to the wait, the M.O.D. (Manager) gave me a card for a \"FREE\" set of rolls on my next visit. The cashier was \"WAY BRAND NEW\" at being a cashier anywhere! Wonderful smile and \"A KEEPER\" for this location. Went to \"BURGER FI\" two days after it opened, and this is in the same plaza as Joe's on South Val Vista across the street from Dana Park. I WAITED FOR 28 MINUTES FOR  (2) TWO BURGERS AND FRIES. NO SORRY FROM THEM, AND I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO \"BURGER FI\"! Here at Joe's, they cared, looked me into my face, and went the extra mile by giving me the card for next time! if you are looking for \"AWESOME, HEALTHY FOOD\", Tokyo Joe's is the place, and with the article in the Arizona Republic stating the growth the company wants, they will do very well in the Phoenix market. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Visited this location for lunch today as it is near my office. Ordered my usual mahi-mahi bowl and it had the same quality and flavor I've grown to know Tokyo Joe's for. For it being lunch hour, they also were pretty quick with getting me my meal. They now serve poke bowls which is pretty neat. I will definitely be back for one of those.

Oh, and the pomegranate green tea is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of my food for the price! I ordered the mahi-mahi bowl with brown rice, which comes with their awesome teriyaki sauce. The bowl was just the right size of food -- enough to satisfy my hunger but not too much that I wouldn't be able to workout later in the evening. I am also a big fan now of their teas, and oh do they have a selection (I went for the passion fruit black tea and did not regret it)! If you're in the area, hit this place up as the food honestly tastes better and healthier than the local competition."}
{"text":"Darn, darn, darn, what happened to this place?!What was once a cool little place to get a somewhat healthy meal quickly, has become a disorganized mess! Great menu options, but the staff seemed genuinely confused. I was told my sushi would take 20 min (fine, I wanted it), but it came out quickly compared to our starter. The rice on the sushi all fell off, so sticky it was not. Chicken skewers were great--love that peanut sauce. There was a very long delay in our entrees, and I watched my husband's bowl sit there a long time before mine was done. My bowl came out nice and hot, hubs was cold. He didn't care, as he strangely likes his food lukewarm (freak!!!), but it bothered me. I would've sent it back. I also usually look forward to the tea bar, but it was just plain gross tonight. There are lots of ice tea options, but at least put the lids on the big dispensers so crap doesn't fall in them and people can't see how dirty they are! Yuck!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! My boyfriend and I come here all the time and we love it! Special shoutout to Mallory and the rest of the crew that was working the night of 03/11. 
You guys should get a tip jar :)"}
{"text":"Gross!!!!  We got Bento boxes - chicken teriyaki with vegetables and udon noodles and one of us got the California rolls and the other the wontons. The only good thing about the entire meal for me were the wontons and my mom said the California rolls are better from Fry's. The vegetables were gross. Chicken wasn't dry, but not great.  It's expensive for minimal food. $30 for our two boxes. There's plenty of other good lunch stops around here we will hit up next time."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of locations (this one and Scottsdale) and they have both been excellent. Healthy for you and yet very tasty.  The Addict club allows you to build points and get a few free items along the way, so I recommend joining that if you plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Have already been here twice... First to the VIP opening (thanks to my daughter who works here) and then again for dinner. Both times the food was great! Chicken is Super fresh and so are the veggies! Both times I got build your own bowls...mmmmmm!!!  I have a friend who had severe dietary restrictions and this is the perfect place! They do everything they can to accommodate food allergies and restrictions without sacrificing taste!  so glad to have a healthy alternative \"fast food\" place in the area! Go to Joe's!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Tokyo Joe's twice, both times I enjoyed it.  The dining room was not busy, but it was clean and seemed like there was ample seating.

We got the addict card in the mail, so one meal was free.  I ordered the build your own bowl with white chicken, teriyaki sauce, and veggies, and the boyfriend got the yakitori bowl.  While the bowls were very simple, they were also very good and you can tell that the ingredients are fresh.  We got ours to go, and they put the sauce on the side without asking, which is good in my opinion.  The second time, they had some sushi out to sample.  I sampled the Arizona roll, which was good but a bit spicy (because of the jalapeno).   They have a few different types of sushi rolls on their menu, all of which sound appetizing.  We also ordered the spring rolls with shrimp.  These were just OK in my book, I've definitely had better from vietnamese places.  I like that they have a sugar free option for sauce (stevi-yaki) and for all the tea lovers, they have like 5 different flavors to chose from.

The service is excellent.  Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and were friendly with the customers.

I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. They have a very organized system by the sign I read. You pick your base: rice, noodles, protein, sauce, and you can pick a combination of vegetables. 

Reminded me of the Chipotle concept which is convenient and easy to follow. The decor is modern hip and has so neo Asian touches. The establishment was clean. 

The employees were very courteous and helpful. Bottom line for me is flavor. I orders the Spicy-tori with Chicken and Vegetables. It looked fresh and colorful but very bland. The sauce is very thick and gelatinous. There was no spices or herbs or any hint of flavor so I probably won't go back. If something  doesn't have any taste then what is the point?"}
{"text":"Maybe basic, but I love this place. The food is consistently fresh, I love the menu options, and it's clean. Everyone can find something to eat here. Prices are decent. I love the soy sauce bottles - Lucky Buddha makes crappy beer but cute bottle decor! Tokyo Joes also conveniently located next to Nordstrom Rack so you can eat there and convince yourself a solid trip to the Rack afterwords burns off your meal."}
{"text":"I love Tokyo Joe's and am here probably once or twice a week and have never had problems. I had a pretty bad experience tonight though. I always call ahead my order on my way to work, and I was doing the same tonight. I got put on hold immediately and thought nothing of it. Except 22 minutes later, I walked inside the restaurant still on hold. I was hoping when I mentioned and showed the staff that I had been on hold for so long, they would expedite my order since I didn't have much time. But all I got was a \"it will take about 25 minutes\". Really disappointed in this and wish they would've done something a little more considering I am here usually twice a week."}
{"text":"When you have a name called Tokyo Joes', you know it's gotta be the gringo version of Japanese.  This restaurant reminded me of some other restaurants or online stuff on how to order.

The food was reasonable good and the portions for the bowls are big.  The gyoza, however, was a disappoint to pay so much for 4 little gyoza's.  You're really better off here just buying the frozen and saving your money on this appetizer.

My husband ordered some steak with brown rice and veggies and that was in the range of $8 or so.  I can't quite remember.  I ordered one of their signature chicken dishes.  Both were regular sized bowls, which were really large for us.  My husband ate all his, but I could only eat half of it.

I liked that they had 4-5 different varieties of teas to choose from which I liked the Hibiscus and something else tea.  My husband and I both ordered fountain drinks and with the appetizer and 2 bowls, it came to about $25.

My husband was fine with this place.  It's not like he loved it or hated it.  So, that's a good thing because he is picky.

The place has good decor, clean lines.  The place is clean, bathroom clean.  Employees sort of nice.  The guy who brought out food was a little not so nice and forgot to bring the napkins I had asked for.  So ambiance is a 5 star, service was a 4 star, food was a 4 star."}
{"text":"WOW! I am kicking myself for not coming to check this place out earlier. Today has been such a beautiful day and since my friend and I were out shopping we decided to make a day of it and get some lunch.  We decided to check out Tokyo Joe's. The front parking lot was packed so we drove around the back and were pleased to see a larger parking lot and even a back entrance to the restaurant. The line was so long it wrapped around the eating area as Weill as people waiting for to go orders, but the wait was very minimal. The employees were very officiant and very helpful helping explain some answers to questions I had about a few of the sauces. I settled on a yakatori bowl, but changed the sauce to something spicier. I also ordered four Arizona rolls which were both so fresh and amazing! The atmosphere was good and loved the outside seating area which is perfect with this weather. I can't wait to come back and try one of the poke bowls! I am sushi obsessed so it won't be long!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's  Surprise.
 
  Excellent.... I have nothing but excellent things to say about Tokyo Joe's. 
Even though my first 2 experiences were not the greatest.  They contacted me and 
They rectified the issues  immediately. 
I was very impressed. I changed my review on this account.i never had a bad meal from Tokyo Joe's and I 
urge you to try them you will love them. Most importantly theirncustomer service is way above everyone else's. 
 They stand behind their reputation and services. 
Thank you Tokyo Joe's , now I can enjoy the same food closer to home."}
{"text":"Love!! I love all the options and yummy food. The pick-up and takeout and super fast too."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and it is easy to make healthy choices. I usually get a brown rice bowl with chicken, top 5 veggies, and green  curry sauce. I love that the west valley is getting some new quick healthy options!"}
{"text":"Great place great service ! Rob is super friendly and all the staff is great ! The fish is fresh :) we come atleast once a week"}
{"text":"A Hangry Beast was growing inside of me when I entered Tokyo Joe's with my 'Free Lunch' coupon. Unable to decipher the menu to build my own bowl, I went with the MoJoe Bowl. It seemed to be their signature dish and came with dark meat, the best kind of meat. And it seemed like an adventurous twist.

After what seemed like an appropriate wait time I was presented with a bowl of something I would expect my 3 year old cousin to make. Only after adding 2 packets of Sriracha did I find that mess of over cooked noodles, frozen pineapple, mechanically separated chicken product with terrible texture and that terrible/cheap watery sweet-and-sour sauce edible. 

On the plus side, they had sriracha on the table and I felt like I was in a nice restaurant with the decor and cleanliness while I was eating a bowl of terrible. 

I have another 'Free Lunch' coupon, I think I'll give it to my little cousin. He likes throwing pasta on the walls."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is great I love the are the choices you get and I love the fact you can create your own meal with choices. It's a great little place and it's very inexpensive and healthy. It's one of the few places that I can take most of my friends because they like that type of food and it's a healthy option so no one feels bad after eating something they shouldn't be. I'm a big fan of rice balls and really love what they do at this place."}
{"text":"I first spottedthis new, 2 day old place in my rear-view mirror at the bank.   \"Healthy Asian Fusion\"? GF & her kids hungry, we're in.
Clean, bright and I mentioned the bathrooms were probably clean enough to eat in, youngest daughter confirmed, 3X...
We had a little of everything & not going to bore you with our opinions of each bite or take photos of our food.  We saw a table taking pix & rearranging for photographic accuracy,wtf? 
Tea bar is cool, each sampled and we discovered that mixing them all together is a special kind of gross which leads a direct path to the clean bathroons, 3X..
But ya, it's all good,fresh and a great alternative to a gut busting burger. It doesnt feel like health food so we balanced that equation with a gallon of ice cream. Which they don't sell, rendering just 4 stars. Gotta have dessert. 
The numerous staff were all very friendly and happy to serve.
Thumbs up all around"}
{"text":"So I wanted to try something new today so I came here I should've gone to panda the noodles or spaghetti or so over cooked in mushy it was disgusting I feel that you guys owe me a pizza"}
{"text":"The inexpensive noodle eatery in Scottsdale beats many of the places of this kind I have been to in the valley. I have to confess that this is my kind of place but it certainly may not be yours. Their set-up is simple; you go to the counter. You order your bowl, the type of carbs, your protein and your vegetables.  The ingredients are fresh, and the flavoring is very palatable, you can add extra chili to dishes if you want a kick, but do try your noodles first before you do this. Very Vegan-friendly, so perfect for anyone who does not eat meat. Very inexpensive, fast and excellent customer service too!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight at 7 and the girl making sushi was great with helping me out.  There was a mix up with the rolls ordered and she corrected my roll right away and got my roomie his correct roll also.  She knows amazing customer service!  Sad I didn't get her name."}
{"text":"Tokyo Joes is a fast casual style restaurant that's pretty good, but I think has some room to get better.

I had a create your own bowl with chicken, veggies, noodle, and the Spicy-aki sauce. The \"spicy-aki\" sauce was a disappointment--not spicy at all. The portion size was monstrous, and I felt like I was getting all noodles.  Shrimp is listed under a signature bowl but not on the BYO, which is a bummer.


This place reminds me of Noodles and Company, but is lacking in combo options. I would love to see some other sushi/bowl/salad combo box. All they have is a Zushi box which is a combo of nigiri and rolls. What if I want a roll combo with a salad? I think it would be great if you had a Trio/pick two style like Panera or Noodles and Company where you could have a bowl and sushi, or sushi and a salad. As it stands now the portions are entirely too big to do this ala carte.


I'll probably be back to try their sushi, but the bowls I may stay away from- too big!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food great, they had our large to go order ready and I was out the door within 5 minutes of arriving.  Staff even helped me to my car without asking.  I got many thumbs up from the staff on their lunch! Thanks everyone that made it a smooth and successful lunch for my team!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Pretty fast at getting take out. And you can enjoy a beer while you wait!! Can NOT beat that!!!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Loooooove this place..... Everything from the good food and the chic design of the restaurant inside.... Short lines and food made fresh per order everytime...... My only one complaint would be that it's always very warm or hot inside the restaurant....  If I'm paying 16.00 or more for a meal.... The least you can do is turn the AC up... It's getting hotter in Az...  If something isn't done about the A/C..... I will have to find another Tokyo Joes to eat at....  And hopefully,  they all aren't hot inside.....  But I do love the Food...."}
{"text":"This place is not worth your money. The sushi is over priced grocery store sushi and the portions are terrible. I got a bento box with steak and got less than 3 bites worth of meat. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to eat here who cares about getting their money's worth."}
{"text":"Decided to meet a friend here for dinner, since we both enjoy Japanese food.  It's what it is...a fast food-type restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring your meal to you at your table.

First impression, the place was clean and the staff was friendly.  My friend ordered the Yakitori Bowl, which she enjoyed a lot.  I decided to make my own bowl with dark chicken, brown rice, zucchini, sweet potato, green and sweet onions, waterchestnuts and teriyaki sauce.  It was also quite good.  I ended up taking some of mine home and enjoyed it later, as well.

I will probably go again, it was just fine.  For a quick meal, I wouldn't have any issue with coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend came in and ordered for to-go today. And he was annoyed that it took such a long time, because we've ordered to go a couple of times and it's never been that long. We got two teriyaki chicken bowls and potstickers. There was no teriyaki sauce only soy sauce. So he drove all the way back to get it, which made him more upset of course. A couple of times we've eaten there the food comes out before the starters (which are cold). We enjoy the food a lot and that's the only thing that keeps us coming back. But the service is poor, meaning it's slow and unorganized. We are almost to the point to stop coming in."}
{"text":"First time here. Pretty delicious. Made my own bowl. Double veggie, white meat chicken, scrambled egg with gluten free teriyaki sauce. I LOVE THAT they use fresh vegetables and know how to properly cook them so they keep their texture. Healthy, huge portion for regular sized bowl, definitely two meals worth. My only complaint is that the carrots and onions are diced instead of sliced. Makes eating them with a fork a little annoying. Should be sliced for easier eating. I also liked their tea selection. Winner."}
{"text":"In general I love Tokyo Joes! For the quality it's a little overpriced but I still think it's good fast food. Yesterday I visited and ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl combo and a Surf N Turf bowl. I used to get the Joes Noodle Bowl but unfortunately they don't serve it anymore(please bring it back). Both were mediocre and I feel the teriyaki bowl specifically would be super easy to make at home. I've ordered the sushi before and it is mediocre as well. The one thing I LOVE about Tokyo Joes is the variety of Iced Tea!! They literally have an iced for any pallet.  Anyway.. all in all I'm still going back let's be real."}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional bowl and California rolls. My husband had a custom bowl. We had never been here before. The place is semi small, plenty of drink options even a sugar free sweet tea which I've never seen before. The staff were all friendly, the place itself could have used attention it was pretty dirty. My California rolls arrived first, meant to take a picture totally spaced it. Now I love all types of rolls but these totally threw me... They tasted very fishy which I haven't had Cali roll that tasted fishy... Not very good. My  bowl came and it looked good, but had a strange taste.. I didn't like it at all. My husband said his wasnt bad... I honestly would not go back."}
{"text":"So I've gone back a couple of times. Their quality has improved or they are doing a better job of checking the food before serving, either way, the vegetables have been fresh. So why 3 stars? Well..if I order takeout and I pick it up shouldn't everything be in there, when I pick up my order? The last time I had to go back inside and get the \"rest\" of my order multiple times on the same trip!  I check before I leave and most people do not. What gets me is, the receipt for the order is stapled to the bag...they should check and verify before they hand the order over. I'm just sayin'!"}
{"text":"The food was really great. I had a poke bowl. I wish there was more salmon and the pieces were bigger. I paid extra for avocado but there was barely any in the bowl which was disappointing. The raspberry tea was wonderful.

The employee was awesome, great attitude, very helpful. 

Can't wait to come back and try the sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered take out California Roll, Chicken satay, and a Udon Noodle Bowl. The California roll had a hair on the wasabi, which I don't use anyway but still gross. The chicken satay, the Chicken was very juicy but the peanut sauce, Not listed as SPICY was WAY SPICY. Not Cool. The Chicken Udon bowl was, well blah, boring as hell. Still in the fridge , who knows if it will get eaten or thrown away. Too many other great place, won't be back."}
{"text":"Joe's is a very inexpensive way to eat a variety of modern Asian staples. The customer service is awesome, there is a good variety of cuisine, and even a fine selection of craft beer."}
{"text":"First time here, looking for healthy asain food. Got the Mahi salad was very fresh with a nice combination of flavors and texture. Would recommend as a alternative to traditional Chinese food."}
{"text":"Always good fresh and fast! Love to make my own bowl. The yakitori peanut sauce is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Meh. I had the oyako bowl. The bowl had a mixture of mushy overcooked and undercooked hard rice. The sauce tasted alright for an oyakodon, but I found it unusual that they used poached eggs with the bowl instead of the typical scrambled eggs. The chicken was a decent amount and there was a sprinkling of green onion on top. I tried some of the yakisoba too which had mushy overcooked noodles and undercooked/raw broccoli.

The only plus about the meal was that it came out really quickly. Overall it was pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"1st review of the new year! Tokyo Joe's concept is great. Fast, fresh, and healthier than other fast food restaurants, they offer Asian style entrees such as rice bowls, noodle soups, and sushi. In addition to preset menu items, you can create your own bowl with a plethora of options.

I opted for the green curry shrimp bowl. It was made in a fairly speedy amount of time, with nicely cooked skewered shrimp. There were a lot of fresh vegetables to go with the shrimp, as well as a generous mound of rice underneath the protein and vegetables. While the vegetables and shrimp themselves tasted OK, I wasn't a big fan of the actual sauce. It tasted too one-dimensional to me, with too much of a sour taste. 

There is a self serve soda fountain with a great selection of iced teas on the side as well. 

Overall, a decent place to dine. I probably won't get the green curry again, but I'd be willing to try other items that they have."}
{"text":"Work nearby and thought we would give this place a shot. Kinda sorry we did. We ordered the crab cheese wonton sushi, it had a decent flavor while eating it, but the after taste was horrible like old fish. Also ordered the classic ramen bowl, the star of that was the hard boiled egg. The chicken was rubbery, the noodles pasty and lacked flavor. I usually find at least something I like and here is no different - the iced tea was fantastic!
All in all, I don't recommend this place. The staff is nice but the food is substandard at best!"}
{"text":"It's so frustrating coming here because they always get my toppings or my sister's toppings wrong when we come. I think they get it wrong like almost every single time I eat here. It's not a huge deal but sometimes it seems like we're nit-picking over small things like say, carrots, or something. It's still annoying to have our order wrong like 9 times out of 10. I now realize I'm going to make them repeat my order because this happens way too often if I do choose to come back. 

It's a shame though because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Saturday and it steady in business. I ordered the spicy salmon poke and a root beer. I liked their setup of to go boxes. I had just sat down to write this review and my food got to me. It looked pretty enough inside and the temp was good, but there were some messy tables. Indie folk played overhead. The bowl was okay, but nothing to really recommend and wasn't all that spicy. The workers were nice and spoke to customers. It is worth a try, but not an absolute must try. It wasn't worth the price though."}
{"text":"Ate there for the 1st time this week. I was very disappointed  in the quality of the food. I ordered noodles,and teriyaki chicken. There was only 4 small pieces of chicken,and the food overall was cold."}
{"text":"For a fast food type restaurant the sushi is very good. The spicy tuna roll and the yo roll are my favorites. The teryaki bowls are average and could use some seasoning."}
{"text":"Before I was able to try the food I watched one of the employees take a wet rag out of a bucket, squeeze out the liquid and proceed to wipe down the food prep table and wall while there was sushi roll being prepped. The rag made contact with the rice. After he completed the clean, he walked away from the area."}
{"text":"Food is not good. We're from Hawaii where we get to eat excellent seafood and the best Asian cuisine so I guess we could be more critical than others, but it doesn't take a food critic to know what is good and what is not. I ordered the mahi mahi bowl. The fish was so overcooked that it was tough, dry, and rubbery. The medley of fruits and veggies that were served with the fish was not a good combination at all. My daughter ordered the teriyaki steak bowl and said the meat was tender, but the teri sauce was bed, and there was so ooooo much of it that she couldn't enjoy her meal. She had it served on white rice, and there was so much sauce that there were no bites of \"white\" rice in her bowl! The rice was all completely covered in the strong tasting sauce. My husband ordered a poke bowl. Okay so for everyone who knows what poke is and eats here expecting poke, don't order it! It's just very tiny, cubed pieces of raw fish...no seasoning whatsoever. The pieces are about 1/3 the size of regular poke and again, just raw fish. Also, it was very little food. I think they overcharged us, too! We ordered a poke bowl, a teri steak bowl, and a mahi bowl (all regular sizes, not the large bowls), 2 soft drinks (1 size, small, refillable) and 1 choc. chip cookie. Our bill came out to just over $40! We will never eat here again and told our friends to do the same. 1 friend said he was going to warn us not to eat here too, but he forgot the name of the place until we told him we ate here and hated it."}
{"text":"Overall I really want to like this place but I have a decent complaint.  First time I went here and ordered their signature bowl there was no problem, good flavor and healthy.  The second time I came here I ordered the Panang sauce bowl.  First bite I knew something was up.  I eat Thai probably at least two times a week.  The flavor was horrible, bitter, with way too much curry and no sweetness.  I asked the staff about it they told me this was normal, no way.  I asked them to make me another bowl and the \"chef\" threw attitude and tossed the bowl on the heating station when it was done in an aggressive way and looked right at me when he did it.  Come to find out by visiting my local Thai restaurant coconut milk prices are through the roof right now and my friend he said they watered it down to save money.  So, that kind of bad experience will keep from coming back.  Sorry Tokyo Joes if you skimp, throw shade, and don't accept accountability you lose customers.  Too many other great options around here."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick and healthy meal. I really enjoy the Green Curry Shrimp Bowl and the Lettuce Wraps. Military members get a free drink with every meal! Join the Joe's Addict Club and get awesome deals, like BOGO coupons. We always have a great experience at this place."}
{"text":"We tend to go to the same places all the time. I was in the mood for something new. I found a great new place. From the moment I was greeted to when we left, it was a 5 star experience.

The staff was super friendly, they made suggestions on what to order, the food was delicious, we will be back. 

Was here last night, now I'm back again for delicious sushi. This is a really nice place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new \"on the go\" sushi place close to home and I wasn't disappointed.  The rolls were fresher than any quick/to go sushi places I have had and the prices were even better.  I got a half Cali tartare, half AZ roll, full size Crab wonton roll, peanut skewers and a cucumber salad all for $22 plenty of delicious food for me and my friend. All the rolls use real crab so no imitation krab here.  I ordered a Cali Tartare roll but they misunderstood and gave me the regular California roll. It was not a problem though; they quickly fixed my order and I was out the door! 

I look forward to going in on Mondays for 2 for 1 sushi roll deals."}
{"text":"Clean and nice looking. It's like a taco bell version to Japanese food. Food is eh. The meat was steamed cooked and veggies were as well. Nothing made actually fresh there, maybe the sushi but I didn't order that. It's a nice concept but mediocre."}
{"text":"The best healthy Asian food you can find in town.  Seriously!  I don't go to Pei Wei as often anymore because this place is so good.  I have the build a bowl with white chicken, brown rice, Stevi-yaki sauce, and veggies.  Very good quality white chicken grilled just right."}
{"text":"We tried this place, the noodles were ok, the appetizers were ok. Just average. We had to ask for silverware, napkins and a bowl to mix the wasabi in. We tried the sushi too, it was average as well."}
{"text":"We went to Tokyo Joe's for the first time, and really liked it., the food was very fresh tasting, and very good portions. I had a delicious chicken bowl with  rice, fresh vegetables and curry. My wife and daughter enjoyed their food also.."}
{"text":"I like this place because I like poke but my husband doesn't  but he'll eat sushi (welcome to my life) so we can get both here. Always very fresh, online order is ready, and staff is pleasant. I get the combo poke so it has tuna and salmon with the half and half so I get salad and brown rice...very fresh!"}
{"text":"Good food I just think a bit over priced for the portion. However, the real problem is the nice blond girl with the curly hair and glasses expediting food doesn't wash her hands after she clears dirty tables. She goes right to picking up and serving food with fingers inside our bowls to get a grip of it with her dirty hands. Think I'll just keep go to Yogis grill. That's just gross!!!"}
{"text":"Food did not come out hot as I would have liked cashier took to long with one customer line started getting long she seemed clueless to anyone but who was in front of her. Restaurant closed while I was in there after getting my food by 1min got up to order side dish they said no and the place was practically empty at this point they seemed more interested in going home than serving food will not be going back!"}
{"text":"My custom bowl:

dark meat (rubbery and weird looking, microwaved? no flavor)

White rice (seemed like instant rice, microwaved?)

Red Dragon sauce (says \"hot hot hot\"  it was \"not not not\" it tasted a like a bottle of regular teriyaki sauce and then they added in some cayenne pepper and a few other spices, meh...)

Broccoli (was ok) 
Carrots (seemed like cubed frozen kind, that have just been thawed out and left in a cool place... not even a quick steam...) 
Red onions (diced and raw, at least they tasted like red onions so win!)

Tossed my recipient but my bill was 7 something, that's with the 50 cent extra fountain drink, pretty sure its a 14oz cup? so if your thirsty stay there to eat so you can get a refill.

Glad I tried it out, but will never ever go back, not sure why it gets so many positive reviews... maybe there sushi is better? or maybe everyone is use to those Costco frozen rice bowels (which actually taste better)"}
{"text":"Why buy a large?
I still love coming to this place but their portions are sorta a rip off. You get just as much food with a small bowl as you do a large."}
{"text":"I love the freshness of the food and the calories are listed and you can't beat buy one get one free on Monday's we like the poke bowls and sushi and the staff is awesome you guys make eating healthy fun"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not impressed with this food. Workers are not the friendliest and it's nearly 2 dollars extra for avocado!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Japanese food, don't even bother.  But if you want a quick meal from a restaurant with a similar setup like Pei Wei, this could be your place.  I thought the ramen was decent, but would I go back for it?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Having never experienced a place like this, I wish I had studied the menu and Yelp reviews and pictures! Luckily there was no one is line when we arrived, so I could try to figure out what I should eat. In the end, I decided that one of their signature bowls should be good. 

The Yakitori bowl had a heavy taste and I was drinking a lot of water a few hours later (translation: too much salt for me). This isn't a fresh, light meal, just the opposite. So if you are pretty hungry, this might be a good option. In contrast, I tried a bite of two other build-your-own poke bowls, and both tasted light and fresh. So, It all depends on what you order and what you are expecting. Just missed the mark for me.

Cashier was a little stoic but the other worker greeted us when we arrived in the line and also on the way out the door."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and both times the food was excellent. I do believe it is a little overpriced, but the food has been great."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at this location two days in a row. Yesterday I had the chicken bowl with brown rice. It tasted very similar to chicken bowls I've purchased at Costco. I was very disappointed, so figured I would give them a shot again today with some sushi. I ordered to dine in, but received my food in a to go bag, so I got to eat out of a little plastic tray, yay. The sushi itself was way below par of what you would get off the shelf at the grocery store or costco..... can't even compare it to a dine in restaurant quality because it's just not there in terms of taste and presentation. Tokyo Joe's menu looks great but their execution is horrendous, will not be returning under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Disgusted with the food. The veggies tasted like they were boiled with the plastic. Noodle was tasteless and cool. The only favor was the sauce that comes with it. Spring roll was soggy. You have a better chance going to the grocery store and getting a frozen microwaveable food for dinner."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice, nice decor. The spring rolls were tiny and very poorly wrapped everything fell out after the first bite. The Oyako bowl was the worst I've ever tasted hardly any sauce very bland and the eggs tasted off and the chicken was extreamly dry. I really should have returned it and tried something else because there is no way I'm going to finish it. I'm  ashamed I paid $15 for this awful food. Should have gone to Kyoto Bowl for my Oyako fix."}
{"text":"this place is FIREEEEEE

like dayum, these guys don't joke around

gotta build a bowl. if you don't build a bowl, who are you? do you ever think for yourself? do you just do what your friends do without a second thought?

anyways, hit em with the:

dark chicken

white rice

red dragon

all the veggies

thats a meal right there!

the red dragon sauce especially is something to keep an eye on. if you like spicy, you'll like this

great value for a great meal"}
{"text":"Really good place for fresh, light, flavorful, hot Japanese take-out.  The menu is huge, so if for some reason you don't like what you ordered, just try something else.  If you find it \"bland,\" try one of their excellent sauces on it.  Their peanut sauce is my own personal favorite.  Personally, I find the sushi, spring rolls, pot stickers and salad all delicious.  This is my new favorite place for Asian take-out, and I plan to be a regular."}
{"text":"My office and family are obsessed with this place. I came for the ahi poke bowl...I had tried a few other places in town and was looking for a fresher tuna. Tokyo Joes was it! They offer a perfect selection of sauces (spicy aoli) and pairings (mango and avocado please), all super fresh. I'm from Hawaii and consider my palette to be discerning with regards to poke. I was very, very pleased. My kids eat healthy and enjoy it here with the bento boxes. Good prices, friendly services. I could not recommend Tokyo Joe's more highly!  Get your butt over there!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Worst bowls ever. Ramen wasn't great and the were vegetables all put on the side of hot noodle bowl. The vegetables in the ramen weren't steamed or cooked, they were just raw. Won't ever be back. Seemed clean, the service was adequate."}
{"text":"Had a craving for sushi,  first and last time I go to anything less than 4 stars and a chain restaurant.  The California roll was very fishy,  and the tuna roll tasted frozen.  Afterwards the food did not sit well with me at all.  Bad sushi going down is on thing,  but making you sick another. Not going back,  but 2 stars for service."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and kind of nice take on an old fried the rice bowl.  Love the options and will need to sample a few more on future trips."}
{"text":"The food was good but a bit on the pricey side for what you get. $4 for 5 pieces of very small gyoza, and $1 extra charge for 1/4 of an avocado. 

The cashier was also not very helpful, nor did she input my order correctly. I asked about their different sauces for the poke bowl and I got very unhelpful answers. 

Me: What's the Nikko Sauce?
Cashier: It's an onion sauce.

Me: Does your Hawaiian sauce have pineapples in it? 
Cashier: Erm.. it's soy sauce based. 
Me: Uh.. ok.... 

Me: How spicy is your spicy aioli? 
Cashier: It's not very. 

She then asked if I wanted my sauce on the side instead of in the bowl, to which I thought was an excellent idea and said yes to. Unfortunately, when the food came out, the sauce was all over my bowl and not on the side, and the sauce was also spicier than a \"not very\". 

However, overall, the food was tasty and it did feel healthy. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Workers here are very rude except for the younger ones. One of the girls that usually make sushi on Monday night is extremely rude and takes 30 minutes or more just to make 2 rolls. I understand there are a lot of orders, but when you ask for an update on your sushi, the girls making it either roll their eyes or just plain ignore you! Not to mention, the girl named Dexy is rude all the time and made me not want to come back. If the manager or owner is reading this, Dexy should be reprimanded for her behavior immediately! All the workers that are clearly of legal smoking age smell like cigarettes. The cooks complain every time they see a longer order and I'm afraid they're purposely going to ruin my food. I used to like this place, but after several bad experiences, my family and I will not be coming back, nor will I ever recommend this location."}
{"text":"Had spring rolls with shrimp. The long slice of cucumber in the spring roll was too hard. The yo roll really wasn't anything special and the crab cheese wonton roll was spicy with no taste. Tea bar is good . Service was good but expected better taste for the money ."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a lower rating only because I have had better at Tokyo Joe's in Denver.  The meals are adequate, but not as good.  I cannot order noodles as the \"udon\" noodle I got the first time I went there was Spaghetti.  Never had this issue in the Denver stores.  I love the spicy Teriyaki sauce.  The steamed rice has a bit of a flavor and odor I am not too happy about, but with enough sauce, I can hide that.  This is not exclusive this place (the rice issue) as many of the establishments in Phoenix area use the same rice (in my opinion a lower quality rice) than what I am used to or but for myself.  A friend ordered one of the noodle soups and again, bad noodles and lack of flavor in the broth had him return the item for a different one.  Just need to get in touch with Denver stores and find out why they do so much better and this will be a great place to dine at."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sushi is good and also the poke bowls. They have a variety of different foods for everyone. They have 6 different organic teas that are yummy. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fast and yummy. What else can you want? Lots of vegetarian options thankfully. That is really hard to find in fast food."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I showed up an hour before closing time, placed an order in an empty restaurant and they forgot my meal. I waited 30 minutes before I realized they billed me but never put my order in que. Pathetic way to start a new location. The couple in front of me got the wrong order and the guy behind me walked out as well."}
{"text":"Two Stars.  One because the food was fresh.  One because you cannot give zero stars.  

My daughter suggested we order takaway from here.  Okay, haven't had Asian food in a few days, so we looked up the menu.  Ordering online is fairly easy - after you register.  I ordered a \"bowl\" with dark-meat chicken, Ramen noodles and \"green-dragon sauce\".  I also ordered a couple of chicken spring rolls.  Wife had the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl, and daughter had the Spicy Salmon Poke Bowl and requested the Sriracha Aioli on the side.

I gotta say the vegetables were quite fresh.  Chicken was okay, cut into bite-sized pieces.  Very dry though.  The bowls were packed to the rim with ingredients and the sauces came in little cups - not nearly enough to bring any moisture to the meal.  I added several packets of soy sauce just to moisten it up and it still did not help.  The green dragon sauce disappeared once I put it on the dish.  It was pretty benign and flavorless for a sauce made with habanero and serrano chiles.  The \"ramen\" noodles were very spaghetti-like.  I mean, as in, douse them with a bolognese and some shredded parmesan and you've got Tokyo Tomaso's.  (with apologies to the real Tomaso's)

Shortly after we placed the order online, we got a call back and the person told us they could not do the aioli on the side as the Salmon is marinated in it.  No problem, we dealt with it.  When my daughter arrived at the store, the crew was still laughing amongst themselves about this silly order.  She was somewhat offended by this and on second thought, that will cost them their last star.  It is not clear on the menu that this cannot be done and it is a reasonable request - not one that should be eliciting laughter and heckling from the crew 15 minutes later - and especially not when the object of their derision walks in the door.  BAD form.


While everybody agreed the veggies were nice and fresh, we also agreed we would not be ordering from Tokyo Joe's again."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki bowl. I was disappointed as there wasn't much chicken or even veggies. Most of the bowl was filled with rice. Their hibiscus tea was really good once some sugar was added. My friends ordered a sushi roll and a poke bowl and the wait for those was pretty long."}
{"text":"Once again. This place is on point. Especially with their 2for1 sushi on Monday nights. Staff is always welcoming, always have great conversation with them and enjoy coming in for some great food. Love living so close to a great place like this one. 

-FroStyles-"}
{"text":"OMG, this was a absolute surprise. My daughter dragged me in and found the food to be so good. My daughter had the Raman and I created my own bowl. All the ingredients are fresh from the vegetables to the protein. Kinda of get tired having the same burger and fries all the time. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bada-Boom! Visiting my parents in Scottsdale was the perfect chance to try Tokyo Joe's since I have been dying to try it for a very long time.

My mother and I went in between lunch and dinner time, it was practically empty so we got to relax and take our time. The handsome guy at the register gave us the low down on everything since it was our first visit, and made sure we were happy with what we were ordering. They have lots of options, hand rolled sushi, salads, bowls, noodles, rice, and appetizers like egg rolls, and edamame. 

I knew I wanted a poke bowl, so I opted for small salmon poke with brown rice, edamame, white onions, green onions, jalapenos, sesame seeds, and cucumber, with the traditional hawaiian sauce.

My mom got the small build your own bowl, and made hers with white chicken, white rice, huge fresh slices of pineapple, and green onions. She didn't know what sauce she wanted so he brought us the hot fire-which was super good, and the hot teriyaki which was also very good.

I also ordered a drink because they have several brews of un-sweetened, stevia sweetened, and sugared teas.. The stevia sweet tea was very good.

The total came to about $22.00. He told us about the #TOKYOJOESADDICT club and reminded us to sign up for a free bowl. We were given a number and found a seat inside.

The food came really fast, and everything was so great, we sat and chatted and enjoyed everything. Neither of us could finish our bowls, so we got to go containers for the other half of our small bowls-which was practically like another whole serving.

I am officially a Tokyo Joe's addict.

one more thing, I remember seeing something about a macro menu and meal plans which I believe they have on a separate menu... something I want to see reviewed if anyone has tried this."}
{"text":"Having been here several times since they recently opened, I can honestly say I have had the same experience each time. Great service, always friendly, food comes out super fast and it's a quantity big enough for a take home box. I love that you can make your own bowl, get exactly what you want in it and it's reasonably priced for lunch."}
{"text":"Food has always been great, I've been here many times. But, if you're looking for somewhere to get something quickly, save this place for when you're not tight on time. For instance, today, I ordered a regular sized bowl, no special requests, while there were maybe 2 other customers there and only 1 person ahead of me (who had been waiting for a while). It took a total of exactly 23 minutes for my one bowl to be ready, without acknowledgement or apology from staff, and I only have a 30 minute lunch break.
Great food. Not great on time."}
{"text":"My coworker bought us lunch so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Disgusting. That was probably the nastiest ramen I have ever eaten in my life. I just ate the chicken and half the egg. The broth made me want to vomit because it taste like seawater, but extra fishy. Instant ramen taste 100x better than this garbage. I guess I should not expect much from an American chain restaurant trying to emulate Japanese cuisine. Gordon Ramsay would definitely not approve."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but when we ordered our food and it was brought to us the dish was mainly rice, had way to much sauce and had an eye lash or some sort of hair in the bowl. The line was way to long to complain so it turned out to be a waste of money. ***Update review as of March 10 2017*** the manager of this location reached out and made things right. We gave this place a second try this afternoon and it was a lot better. Good portion of meat, rice and veggies. I ended up getting the salmon and steak which were both cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Went here today with my husband, mom and grandma for lunch. There is a steady stream of customers coming through the door but the line moves quickly. 

Had edamame, spring rolls and spicy tuna rolls to start. The spring rolls were awesome! I would definitely order those again! Spicy tuna wasn't very spicy but it was good. And edamame was standard. Always good. 

I ordered the #1 bowl but with rice instead of noodles and I really liked it. Lots of veggies and chicken and I liked the crushed peanuts on top. Mom and grandma also had that bowl but with noodles and they thought it was good. Hubby ordered curried shrimp and he loved his shrimp. We also ordered the dessert rolls {I didn't try} and everyone at the table said they were just so so. 

The BEST part- I am an iced tea snob and they have 5 kinda of yummy flavored brewed iced tea. Only one was sweetened and it was with stevia {ok by me}. Tried two flavors and both were great! 

I liked this place- clean and new. Service was good. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food-born illness? Gee, thanks so much. Just want I wanted. As if hearing the chef (and also possibly manager?) talk down to his employees right in front of customers repeatedly wasn't enough to make me uncomfortable as a patron, imagine how I'm feeling hunched over my toilet here at 5:00 am right now."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff.

I don't care for the bowls and was not a fan of the sushi but their salads are really good.

My favorite is the Tokyo Joes Lettuce Wraps. Don't let the name fool you. These are not your typical lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Tokyo Joe's, and we were really impressed. There are not many places we can eat full meals as a family, as we adults are picky eaters and our son is autistic and has a limited diet. 

I had the ahi tuna poke bowl. It was delicious. I think my only quibble is that they added a lot of wonton strips on top--if you look at the picture, it actually looks alike a bowl of cereal! But everything tasted great and fresh.

My husband had a bento box with beef, veggies, and gyoza, and was quite happy. It's hard to find good gyoza in Arizona, but they did it well here.

And our son had the kid's meal macaroni and cheese. It looked like the Kraft stuff, which pleased him. He also had the chocolate cookie (well, most of it) and it was freshly-baked and very good. I had to have a sample for quality assurance, of course.

The place was kept clean even though it was quite busy at 11am on a Sunday. As we prepared to leave, a gentleman came around to clean our table and checked to make sure we liked everything.

I'm looking forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, fast food! Finally!

My husband and I were going to get Chinese takeout but saw this place and decided to give it a go. We each got a \"make your own\" bowl. We are vegetarian and they had a grilled tofu as their protein option which was crispy and firm which we like. So we each had: Tofu, Udon noodles, (brown rice for him), delicious sauces on the side so we could control the amount and tons of fresh, colorful veggies. They were both huge portions and we really enjoyed our meal! Very friendly service and an impeccably clean restaurant (although we took it to-go) we would definitely dine in any time!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot! I had my first sushi bowl here and i was pleasantly surprised. I got the tuna sushi bowl and it was really good, especially with the yummy spicy soy sauce they have there on it. although the portion was a little small, i definitely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"good food, good service. they always make it how i like it it's quick and rarely have to wait long. 

I go as often as I can :)"}
{"text":"Went to Tokyo Joe's for the first time this weekend and it was delicious. The ingredients were fresh, the menu options were vast and healthy and the establishment was clean with friendly service. Will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"My wife orders Bento box with steak, spicy aki, brown rice, a 8 piece yo roll, and combo roll. They hand her the order and the guy says, \"wait, we forgot your sauce\" Hands her a cup of spicy teriyaki sauce. 
We arrive home. There is wasabi and ginger with the spicy to roll and no soy sauce. The salad with it is dry and nothing. No dressing! With nothing to put on it at home, it goes in the garbage. Also, the portion of steak which was an extra 1.50 added to the 9.60 was barely enough to feed a small child. Disappointing...
On top of that, my wife tips them$3!!! Im like WTF!"}
{"text":"So I've been going to Tokyo Joe's for years being as they started in Denver and there used to be one across the street from me!   Was pleased to see they finally started opening them here in AZ. However, the food is healthier than your typical fast food, but it's still just basic and \"ok\".  It isn't a knock it out of the park Asian food. The food is very Americanized. That being said, if you're ok with that, then you won't be disappointed.  They have changed their menu over the years though and the Poke bowls are ridiculously overpriced - $11 and menu has become cumbersome.  Go to a genuine Poke place. Ramen isn't authentic or good, but the rice bowls and tofu are pretty ok. Last time we went they were out of white rice which really put a damper on dinner.  How is a place like this out of rice??  That's like McDonald's saying they're out of burger buns!  This location also needs to figure out where the line to order starts and ends-creates a bunch of confusion!!  They definitely have some work to do here!"}
{"text":"This place was quick and easy to order. The staff was helpful. I ordered something incorrectly and they fixed it without hesitation. Also everyone was really nice. The choices are healthy which I love and the portions are huge so I needed a to go box."}
{"text":"Disappointed in myself for waiting so long to try this gem! 
I stopped in on a Friday evening and was in and out! Super fast service. 

I did the build your own bowl. Steak, Rice and Broccoli with the spicy teriyaki sauce. Simple yet delicious. The sauce came on the side and was so good! Perfect amount of spice. 

They have a huge selection of sushi, bowls and salads. Reasonably priced given the portion of food you get. 

The restaurant decor was modern and very cleaned up. Staff was fast, friendly and efficient. 

Only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the steak was a little cooler than the rest of the meal and wasn't sliced all the way through so when I went to shake the bowl up it didn't separate. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"So yummy! My first time in! Quinton helped me at the register and he was so pleasant! I love how there is a sugar free version of teriyaki sauce! Spring rolls are so good! I will definitely be back to try
Some sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - Brittany was wonderful! Our order was mixed up but she handled it and made the order right. Food is really fresh and yummy. They even have a meal plan menu for those watching their macros. Check this place out if you haven't done so already!"}
{"text":"I normally order online from this location because my break is 30 min, it's close, and i love the food. Today, i guess because of a lunch rush, they didn't have my order ready when it was scheduled for pickup, so it ate into 10 minutes of my already short lunch break for me to get my food. Without my prompting him, the manager gave me a free entree ticket as an apology. I'm really blown away at the customer service there. You can't always control mistakes at a company, but you can control how you respond to them, and this location proved it really cares about it's customers."}
{"text":"I happen to be shopping in the area & found this place... nice fresh fast sushi , they also offered kabuki grill bowls. restaurant is well-kept and there is an outdoor eating area . Pricing is great and yes you can bring the kids ! Located right near Nordstrom rack!  loved it , I'll be back"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. If I want to get my belly full but still feel healthy, the ahi tuna poke bowl makes me happy every time. If you ask the employees for suggstions or want to try a sauce hey are more than accomodating. Good food, good people and a comfortable environment make this one of my fave places to eat."}
{"text":"Tonight the Jolly Diners had our dinner at Tokyo Joe's. This establishment is clean, with a nice decor, good service, and great food. For starters Mom & Sis had potstickers, while I had the spring rolls. I had a bento box with a selection of veggies that I got to pick myself, salad, teriyaki tofu, and 3 pieces of tofu sushi. It wad excellent.  Mom had a children's meal (see pictures) cause she doesn't eat very much, and Sis had another bento box she designed herself. I wouldn't say Tokyo Joe's is a good place for cozy family dining, but is like McDonald's as far as the seating, but with much better food and decor.  The service was great,  the food much better. Tokyo Joe's is for people who want to eat healthy, get in and out quickly, and have a good selection from the great menu.  The Jolly Diner's rated our dinner at a 5 out of 5. Really good."}
{"text":"This is the second time i've had Tokyo Joes, the previous time I had a bowl, that was relatively good, not to forget the staff, they were really nice and the restaurant was nice and clean. This time I got a Joe's roll and a California roll and they were just TINY. I couldn't believe it when I got back to work. I just figured for the price, it would have been a bit more filling, but now I know what to expect. I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it doesn't look like i'll be back."}
{"text":"We love it here. Great poke bowls, and always great service from Rob.  We Drive out from far north Peoria at least weekly! Fingers crossed Tokyo Joes will open up around Happy Valley/Lake Pleasant one day."}
{"text":"3/31/17- Great food! However, while eating my Teriyaki bowl, I almost broke a tooth on a shard of glass. It looked just like the onions, so I didn't see it. Glad I didn't swallow the glass. 
I called over at 5:45 and asked to speak to the manager, but had left for the night. I told the girl who answered what happened. I explained that I didn't want my money back or a meal, but they need to discard the rice, onions and chicken. More glass could be in the food and someone could get injured. Her reply was \"well make sure to do that\". Pretty much didn't seem to care. I'll stop by today and hand deliver the glass back to the manager."}
{"text":"This location has issues with consistency and the final issue I have was planning an order online for pickup and it was still being made 20 min after the pickup time. The order was placed over an hour before the pickup time.
Revised after I called the store the manager gave an excuse that it's busy and ordered are taking 20 min to make so 30 min later after the pickup time an hour after it was placed the food was ready.  The best part is when he  swore at me and hung up on me.  Regional manager email for others that get treated like crap is jeff@tokyojoes.com"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with my wife and 5 year old.  We got most of the rolls and spring rolls.  This place is basically \"fast-food sushi\".

You order at the register and the food is delivered to your table.  We weren't given any plates.  I thought it was odd that napkins are kept behind the register.

To be honest, the only thing I liked was the Poke Roll.   I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"great food and fast service. i will totally be back"}
{"text":"Went here altering hearing how it is a much healthier alternative to fast food, and it's close to home. I am a fan, I definitely will return. 

I ordered the MahiMahi bowl with no rice just extra veggies; and I must say I can't believe they charge alost $2 extra for extra veggies-Really!! I didn't think the amount of extra veggies seemed extra at all, so there's the four stars. I also got a four piece sushi-which was pretty craptacular to say the least; don't get the sushi it's not flavorful at all. 

I went with my family, my kids were satisfied with their meals and the pricing for kids meals was great $5. My husband got a beef bowl with noodles and he enjoyed it. We spent about $40 for our family of four, this was two kids meals, two small bowls, green tea and four piece sushi-not bad for clean food. 

All in all, we will return. Recommended for the night you don't want to cook and don't want pizza!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Located in the same area as Potbelly sandwich and Cafe Zumas, with lots of available parking. 
Restaurant was clean and well lit.  Staff were friendly.  Menu was easily visible and comprehensible. 
Food was exceptional, filling portions, and very tasty.  Lots of options on the menu from traditional pre-made options to create your own options.  
Lots of available drinks from a variety of iced tea flavors to your usual run of the mill soda fountain drinks. 
My only gripe was that the place appeared to be on the small size (-1).  During popular times, like today on a Saturday, seating was limited with all seats (inside and outside) being occupied.  With a little bit of waiting, thankfully one became available. 
Definitely will return, and would recommend as their menu is very health consciously designed!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. I went around noon on a Wednesday and the line went by faster than the Chipotle nearby. I got the Yakitori bowl and it was delicious! Chicken, mixed veggies, ramen noodles, and Yakitori sauce. Price wasn't too bad---about $8 or $9 for a meal. A great place to have a fast and yummy lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few Fridays ago for a quick meal. I got a build-your-own bowl and it was really good. What I really like about this place is the array of Vegetarian and Gluten Free options, including sauces. Plus they take the whole GF thing seriously, so that's always impressive and appreciated. My friend got a Bento Box and enjoyed it. We both decided we would definitely come back again and make it a part of our fast food line up!"}
{"text":"Great quick & healthy option!!

I love the idea of customizing your 'bowl' with your choice of protein, carb, sauce & veggies!

I got the white chicken protein bowl with brown rice & choice of veggies for $8. Pretty decent amount of food & it was made to order.

Will be back as it is super close to work & convenient."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to go! The food is delicious and great quality, plus the price is very exceptional! The rolls are delicious and are priced very low compared to what you would pay for at a such restaurant. Their Poke bowls are my favorite but can get a bit expensive if you add extra toppings. Overall, I would highly recommend to anyone who loves sushi or loves eating healthy!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Tokyo Joe's. The new Poke bowls set it over the top. However, most poke bowls from other restaurants showcase the fish. There are usually large cuts of fish and a bigger fish to rice ratio. This version of the poke bowl is basically a ton of rice and a little bit of tiny cut fish. No matter ... it's still really good. I just wish there was an option for double fish or for them to give me quality cuts or tuna instead of tiny cubes. 

I'm giving this place 3 stars however, because I usually start with an appetizer. Their menu has starters, which is another word for appetizer. Which is a tiny portion of food to start your meal or wet your appetite before the actual meal. The \"stated\" here is actually served during the meal or in one case after. How is this a \"starter?\" They should really change  the name because at this point it's really just a side item. I've never been to a place that served appetizers during or after the meal. This is why I dock it a few stars."}
{"text":"If you are  looking for something quick to eat that's also healthy this place is it, you can create rice bowls any veggies and protein you want to add, great fast service and delicious food, I got the surf and turf with brown rice, maybe a little too saucy but next time I'll get sauce on the side. I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We typically call ahead and pickup our order. It seems Every. Single. Time. something is wrong with our order.  No shrimp in shrimp spring rolls, hard/old spring rolls, missing spring rolls, missing sushi rolls, inconsistent flavor/taste etc... it's super frustrating bc we have a new baby at home so we can't just go back to the restaurant. Even without a little one it's still super inconvenient. I really enjoy the food I just wish they paid more attention to detail. I've called a few times expressing concern but they aren't very accommodating or apologetic. I'll likely reach out to corporate soon bc this place has potential but the staff is just really bad."}
{"text":"We always order take out from here,  very convenient and tasty! Udon noodles are good very tasty  spicy sauce.  Ramen bowl is also good!"}
{"text":"We went here for a quick dinner and we got what we wanted. Most importantly, the air conditioning was working so the initial experience was refreshing and we were able to enjoy the difference between the outside and inside temperatures.

If you have not been to Tokyo Joe's before, all you have to do is choose what you want, mosey up to the counter and order. There are lots of choices. If you don't know what to order just have one of their speciality bowls.

I ordered a poke bowl with ahi tuna and white rice. I know, I should have ordered the brown rice but I wanted white rice. The rice was light and complemented the meal well. I also had the Hawaiian sauce and a bunch of added toppings and flavor bits (ginger, wontons).

They have quite a good selection of drinks including beer. They also serve sushi and salads and other bowls."}
{"text":"As I patiently waited for my 2 rolls, I witnessed 4 customers order after me and get their meals, 2 dining in separately and 2 walk ins.....all whom had rolls included, (2 not preordered). When I inquired why this occurred the sushi chef stated \"sometimes that just how they're made, in different orders\"....unacceptable! NOT coming back."}
{"text":"Healthy food at an affordable price. Ramen is decent. Had to add some sriracha, soy sauce, and spicy powder to give it more of a kick. No complaints though. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place, location and wonderful food. Their surf and turf with rice is fantastic.  I'm a regular and super convenient and great tasting food."}
{"text":"Great things:  Fun ambiance, many healthy options, and speedy service.

Not so great things:  Portions and Flavor

While I don't have anything horrible to say about Tokyo Joe's I also do not have anything great to say about it either, which leads me to believe that it wasn't that worthwhile of an experience, or a dinner.  I left still feeling hungry, but not wanting to go back and order more."}
{"text":"Good experience for my first Tokyo Joe's experience as well as my first sushi bowl! I got the ahi tuna bowl and was pleasantly surprised with how tasty everything was. The rice was good and so was the fish itself. My only advice is don't come here if you're starving! Although it was good, my bowl was really small and didn't seem like a whole lot of food. Otherwise, not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Great food! If ur not getting sushi it's usually super fast. Staff is friendly. My only suggestion is that on sushi Monday too get an additional sushi chef. I didn't have a problem with waiting but other customers seemed frustrated, which made me kind of mad at them cause the sushi guy was working hard (you can literally see him moving fast) but the customer was still being rude. But anyway I appreciate how he took it and continues to bust his but"}
{"text":"A little disappointing. The logo says healthy but veggies cost extra on some items, I was told 5 oz of veg but didn't seem like very much. And if you order the salmon ask for it medium unless you like salmon jerky. They do have a lot of choices. Will probably try something else next time, maybe sushi or a poke bowl."}
{"text":"If you see a sign on the highway that advertises sushi at the next truck stop, it will be better than this place.  Sorry Tokyo Joe, my first and last time to visit, just sub par on everything, service was slow, rice was dry on my rolls, and the meager stuff inside was terrible.  Could not finish my $17 worth of garbage and went across the street to get a $5 Wendy's double cheeseburger."}
{"text":"A friend had warned us this place was not great.  We should have listened.  But, like many a drunken sorority girl who downed just 1 more Jello shot, we are definitely regretting our choices the next day.....

My husband has been on a poke bowl kick, after several business trips in the Bay area where, apparently, good poke bowls are as easy to come by as a Dunkin' Donut in Boston.  So, I Googled poke bowls in Avondale, as I recalled hearing a poke bowl restaurant was slated to open in the new power center along McDowell and 103rd Ave.  Sadly, that place is not open yet, but my search revealed Tokyo Joe's offers poke bowls, so off we went.

He placed our order to go, a poke bowl for him and the chicken satay and potstickers appetizers for me.  While I understand that the quality of the food may have been hampered by the 15-minute drive home, I think it would have been only marginally better had we consumed it on sight, fresh out of the microwave.

The best thing I can say is the peanut dipping sauce was nicely spicy and had a good peanut flavor.  Sadly, the texture of the chicken made it clear the meat had been pulled from the giant vat of industrial grade pressed chicken parts, fresh out of the freezer.  I have seriously had better hospital food!

The potstickers were pressed together and flattened, resembling some sort of potsticker pancake.  The wrappers were doughy and spongy, no crispy carmelization from a good pan saute.  I'm not even sure what the filling was, I got no identifiable taste of anything.  There were 5 in the order, but I'm not sure where one ended and the next began, as they were all a giant mass.  Also, the dipping sauce was very weird, off balance and with a strong vinegar flavor.  I would have rather gone to the Costco across the street and bought a bag of potstickers and cooked them at home myself.

Finally, on to my husband's poke bowl.  He complained that it was completely flat and flavorless.  I tasted a chunk of the salmon and had to agree.

The experience left both of us queasy and regretful, our wallets $20 lighter to boot.  Might better have joined the sorority girl with one more Jello shot."}
{"text":"Really good. If your wanting to stick to healthier, quick service food this is the place for you. Their food is good, and the customer service is excellent. My favorite is the ichigo salad. They are a little pricey, but worth it in the end. Never gives me that sick feeling after eating them. Always a favorite go to place, if I'm looking for something a little healthier."}
{"text":"I ordered a poke bowl and grabbed a chocolate chip cookie at the register. The poke was OKAY; sauce was not bad, however there wasn't enough of it. I ordered white rice as my base. A couple of chunks of fish looked like they had been out too long. The cookie was hard and gross. I did not finish it. 
I've had better poke (and cookies). Good customer service but not enough to go back."}
{"text":"Very mixed feelings about my experience. I follow TJ on IG and see Johnjay from Johnjay and Rich always posting about this place. So I was excited to give them a try. 
First of all. The menu was overwhelming. I wanted everything. Lol. Not their fault. But I mentioned to the young lady that took our order it was our first time in. She didn't even try to explain anything to us. There wasn't anyone in line behind us, but she rushed us. I ended up creating my own bowl and my husband ordered the surf n Turf bowl. He also got a Cali roll and I ordered the chicken skewers. 
Once we got our food, I thought I ordered extra veggies but didn't look like extra. But it was still more than enough food. I was impressed with the portion of the salmon. And flavors were good. It was hard to decide on which sauce to get because there were so many. 
The chicken skewers was basically one chicken breast torn apart, didn't seem cut with a knife at all, and stuck on skewers and put on a plate. The peanut sauce was delicious though. Overall the meal was good. Service was just slacking. There was probably ten employees behind the counters just hanging out chatting up a storm.  Couldn't tell if they were on break or what. 
Then it wasn't until we were done and leaving a realized they have a reward program. That would have been nice to know about. :(
I want to go back and try other stuff. But will prob go to another location in hopes service is better."}
{"text":"Just OK. It was my first time and I tried the sushi. It was very basic and portions are quite small. It also took too long for my order to come up. The staff was very pleasant so I will give it one more try, maybe a bowl next time."}
{"text":"Lunch at Tokyo Joes today was some sushi and a poke bowl. First time here. Staff very nice and helpful. Lots of yummy options for poke fillins. Service fast and restaurant was clean! Will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian, do not eat here. The tofu tasted like charcoal and the rest of the ingredients in the bowl were bland. It was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. 

We ordered spring rolls with tofu and they gave us chicken and then complained about the fact that we had to send it back and they had to remake it. The staff made fun of us in the back for the whole duration of our meal. One of my favorite lines was \"I'm tired of having to remake things for vegetarians.\" I'm sorry, but if you offer vegetarian options, you better not complain when you screw up.

The only plus side to this was the manager. She was very nice and personable though we had to get her ourselves because the waitresses refused to do so. 

When vegetarian options are added, the staff should expect to serve many vegetarian customers and should be professional about it, not making fun of us to where we can hear it. They further complained after one waitress spilled water all over us and some of the food when we asked for replacement bowls. 

This place is bad, not worth the money or time. It made everyone in my group sick, even those that eat meat, and is an overall horrible place."}
{"text":"I honestly have eaten here 3-5 times a week ever since it opened a few months ago.  Other people that said negative things seem to be ordering the \"safest\" things on the menu then complaining about not being blown away.  True it isn't cheap, but the quality/health value is noticeably higher than similar restaurants, although I wouldn't be able to compare it to any other place, as it is in its own category...from the uniqueness of the menu, to the liberal use of vegetables, to choices in the self serve Iced tea bar, to the atmosphere and pleasant/helpful employees...all with a healthy, clean, Japanese vibe.  I typically Order the General Joe's soup( I like it with Brown rice and Avacado), the Joe's lettuce wraps(like no other lettuce wraps you have had) or the Resolution bowl with Soy Ginger dressing (many of the \"sauces\" are too thick for me so I use the salad dressing with anything as I feel it preserves the texture of the vegetables, etc without a gooey layer on everything.  Keep it real Tokyo Joe's!"}
{"text":"I came here with my dad and stepmother. I got a bento box with chicken teriyaki, Cali roll, edamame, and white rice. I also got a yo roll. The roll was ok. Not as great as i hoped but was the quality of say buffet sushi or grocery sushi. The box was kinda disappointing. They gave me noodles instead of rice and mixed veggies instead of edamame. The chicken was good tho might have had a little too much sauce. I'd stick with the bowls. Also the Cali roll was terrible."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Tokyo Joe's before, but I kept seeing the \"Coming Soon\" sign for this brand new location and was looking forward to trying it. 

I walked in on a Saturday, a mere 4 days after their opening, and by noon, it was quite packed. The set up is very similar to Pei Wei; you order at the counter, they give you a number (if you're dining in), and you choose a seat. There are various seating options, from tables to the counter seating against the glass windows. Seating capacity is @ 135. They also have about 7 or 8 outside tables for those perfect weather AZ days.  They have some bottled drinks and fountain drinks. Their fountain machine consists of Pepsi products and there is a tea bar with 6 different iced tea flavors. 

As most vegans do, I did my research online before visiting so I was already aware of the vegan options, which are plentiful. (Check the allergen menu online or in the condiment corner of this location to confirm vegan items, etc.) All rice and noodles are vegan except the ramen noodles, which contains egg. All sauces and dressings are vegan except the Oyako sauce, which contains fish in its broth. 

I opted for the build your own bowl. I ordered 1/2 brown rice, 1/2 Udon noodles, tofu, and veggies. There's an option to pick your own veggies; for an additional $1.45, you can pick an \"unlimited\" amount. Because I am picky, I decided to do just that. I chose broccoli, carrots, spinach, edamame, jalapeño, and green onions. (In case you're wondering, the free veggie option comes with the \"Top 5\" veggies, which are broccoli, carrots, snap peas, zucchini, and edamame.)  For my sauce, I picked the Spicy-Aki, which is a spicy Teriyaki sauce. 

The bowl was very good and the veggies were extremely fresh. That Spicy-Aki sauce was delicious! Not spicy at all (to me), but the flavor was excellent, nonetheless. There are 2 bowl sizes, regular and large. I got a regular bowl for $8 (including the extra fee for my veggies) and it was very filling. The rice and noodles were plentiful, as was the tofu.  As for the broccoli, spinach, and jalapeños, there was 1 piece of broccoli, 2 or 3 spinach leaves, and 2 pieces of jalapeño, so that \"unlimited\" spill is to the contrary, quite limited. 

Aside from them being stingy with my veggies, I enjoyed my meal and plan to return to try all of the yummy vegan sauces."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat!! Friendly staff ALWAYS and consistently fresh, delicious food. Will continue to come back and order a chicken rice bowl with steve-aki. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm leery of japanese fast food places so am surprised to be leaving such a positive review.  The vegetables are not over-cooked, the portions are generous and food is very tasty.  Healthier alternative to other places and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I just witnessed the most disgusting thing I've ever seen!!! Sitting here waiting for my food and witnessed the cook picking his teeth. Then proceeded to prep food. All the other employees had gloves on. NOT HIM!! DID NOT WASH HIS HANDS!!! I wanted to throw up. Asked for a manager and was told there isn't one.......would you stay or ask for a refund??? SO GROSS!"}
{"text":"Yummmmy!! I live for a good poke bowl and I am happy to have found this place! Thank you to JohnJay and Rich for always talking about Tokyo Joe's that made me want to try it. I walked in and ordered their ahí tuna poke. They made it for me according to what I wanted on it. Every bite was delicious and tasted very fresh! I was extremely happy with the quality and service. I will definitely be coming back! Thank you Tokyo Joe's!"}
{"text":"First time today at Tokyo Joe's, and cant wait to come back. The food was great and service was good. I got the Poke Ahi Tuna bowl and it exceeded expectations. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I built my own bowl. I did steak (had a school cafeteria quality), ramen noodles (severely over cooked and mushy) broccoli (3 pieces), edamame beans and carrots. I got it in the peanut sauce, which I will admit they do describe it as thick, I just wasn't expecting actual peanut butter consistency. We also ordered the dumplings and online there is an option for no green onion. Got the food and it was sprinkled with green onions which I can tolerate as they are easy to remove, but the filling was packed with them  $27 not well spent"}
{"text":"I hate having to be gluten free but this place completely understands and offers everything gluten and dairy free if I request it! This place is very considerate of food allergies... great management! The manager personally made my food! So happy to have a great place to eat out at and know that it won't make me sick!!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place it was great when it opened. The food and service has progressively gone down hill. It seems like the staff has turned over several times since they opened. The sushi rolls used to be perfect. Now they are loosely rolled and the \"not so sticky\" rice was off color and fell right off the roll. Something on the plate had an off smell and the avocado was brown. Needless to say I gave them the roll back and had a sandwich next door."}
{"text":"Excellent choices!! First time here and we had an Oyako bowl, a surf n turf bowl and a Bento Box- super fresh and delicious!! Tea variety for drinks was an added bonus!!"}
{"text":"Ok.. Went here for lunch on my sons recommendation, and wow..  What is going on with this new generation??  
This was one of the worst restaurants I have been to.  The food does Not taste fresh, the veggies are diced so small it looks like and tastes like they are using like birds eye frozen diced vegetables..  The noodles have No taste and are too thick.. Hardly any meat, I had to search through the bowl to find a couple of pieces.  The sauce is in a plastic container and brought to you with your bowl, and it was like a 
Jell-O shot.  
The sushi is Horrible.. It tastes worse than the pre packaged sushi in circle k, unless you enjoy chewing on the stale seaweed for an hour or two after you finish your meal.
All of the food had a strong processed food flavor like right out of the microwave.  Yuck.
The best thing I can say about this place is that their soda machine is still so new that the drinks taste good..  
Do yourself a favor and Treat yourself to Pei Wei right across the street for REALLY delicious Asian food for the same or less money.. Or Ra for Fresh Delicious Sushi!!"}
{"text":"I loved this spot!  I got the Teriyaki Bowl-the large size and I couldn't finish it.  Great add in options and you can customize the sauces.  Mmmm!  Light and luscious."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place! After seeing the \"coming soon\" sign, I eagerly checked out their website and was excited by the prospect of a build-your-own teriyaki bowl with so many great sauce and veggie options. However, after trying Tokyo Joe's for the first time a couple of weeks after opening, I don't plan on going back.

To give credit where it's due, the decor was nice, and the staff were very friendly. The cashier was patient with me and let me try a few of the sauces before I locked one down - I went with the yakisoba, which was kind of a sweet and spicy peanut sauce. So far so good!

Up until this point, things were going well and I was looking forward to a tasty lunch. $10 was a little steep, I thought, for a teriyaki bowl (I got a large, dark meat chicken bowl, add veggies), but I'm happy to pay a premium for the customization options, tasty food, and a good size portion. Unfortunately, after trying the food, I was upset that I spent any money on it.

Here were the issues:
-Soba noodles were over cooked and flavorless. Honestly, I would have been fine with the texture if they had flavor, but alas, no such luck. Quick fix: boil in salt water
-Chicken was completely flavorless. Like literally, flavorless. I was so shocked because chicken thighs are so easy to cook and they totally soak up the flavor of whatever they are marinated with. Quick fix: add salt and pepper to chicken prior to cooking! Better fix: marinate the chicken or soak in brine prior to cooking. This was a total missed opportunity.
-Same as the soba and chicken, veggies were as bland as can be. Also same as the soba and chicken, some salt would have gone a long way. Additionally, if the veggies were sauteed rather than steamed, I think they would have been much better.
-Even with the sauce (and I ended up asking for extra), this tasted like food at an old-folks home.

I'm hopeful that Tokyo Joe's will start adding some seasoning to their food, but in the meantime, I can't recommend this place to anyone. If you're just looking for a good teriyaki bowl (which up until this point, I didn't think you could screw up), do yourself a favor and just go down the street to Samurai Sams."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while. We drive by at least once a week. We finally stopped in. Having looked at the menu on line I was pretty sure what I wanted. I went with the create your own bowl. So I picked the grilled salmon. This is a large piece of grilled salmon. I also chose my 5 favorite vegetables and brown rice. All this was drizzled with red dragon sauce. Thanks to a fellow Yelper's tip I ordered the regular sized bowl. This was more than enough for me. 

The food was ready in about 15 minutes. They brought it out to our table. The meal was tasty, but didn't knock my socks off. The salmon was the best part of the meal. I tried a piece of yo roll sushi my daughter offered me. I'm glad I didn't go with the sushi. The rice was dry and the sushi lacked taste. It didn't seem fresh to me. 

The two reasons I'll be back again are:
1.) The price is reasonable.
2.) I don't know of a similar place in the area."}
{"text":"What a gem! So excited to have this in our area! It's a fresh, innovative and healthier approach to Teriyaki! Their menu is super diverse, they have something for everyone! Even gluten intolerance and sauces made with stevia! It was really neat to order sushi and watch them make it while they made the rest of our take out order. The young gentleman at the register was really knowledgeable and helpful with the menu! The restaurant was really clean and open. The food was so delicious and fresh! It's really nice to be able to completely customize your dish. Excited to return in the future!"}
{"text":"Discovered this extraordinary sushi gem while on a business trip to Phoeni.  Albeit hidden near Nordstrom s Rack yet well worth the hint. Friendly staff. High quality sushi. Reasonable serving sizes. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went to try out Tokyo Joes for the first time yesterday since I've seen it for a while and looked interesting.  Got the wild salmon, spicy tuna rolls, noodles and 5 veggie bento box.  Thought it was good and healthy (trying to start off the new year right) and the sauces were good.  Not a bad first time...until 2 1/2 hrs later while I'm throwing up everything I ate on my way home from work.  Cold sweats, chills and the worst food poisoning...that's what my $14 got me."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My five year old even enjoyed it and she's super picky!! Great and very fast service too!"}
{"text":"They advertise buy 1 and get 1 free sushi
But the price total is more expensive than going to eat at a real Japanese sushi restaurant.
This is not a real sushi restaurant
They some green vegetable eating place that happened to put rice and fish together"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was ok for the price. Really didn't get the full experience since the lunch rush was so heavy."}
{"text":"WOW! I can't believe this place has any fans.  The teriyaki surf and turf my daughter got was way too sweet and there was so much that it was almost a soup! My wife got the yakitori which also disappointing. I tried the General Joe's Soup, it was so bad I refused to eat it which is a first. I was raised to not waste food and there is very few things I will not eat. Liver, chicken hearts and gizzards, I think something called chichironis which is deep fried cow utters. I thought those were bad but still choked down more than I did of the soup. Being half Japanese and raised in California I have eaten so many types of food, this was horrible. The spring rolls were so chewy it was impossible to take bite. I was amazed at the positive reviews. I think people are confused and believe the fresh vegetables made the meal healthy. Maybe take off all the crappy sauces and it would be healthy. 

Also, the service was annoying. First time there and the girl behind the counter was irritated at our slow decision. From the reviews the Manager Andrew is great, well he wasn't there so I'm sure the service would have been more positive had he been there but that just couldn't help the food. 

I enjoy Thai Basil and even Thai Chili ToGo and usually get the drunken noodles. Kona Grill is pretty good but mostly I prefer cooking myself but I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"First of all, I liked the clean and upbeat decors.  Watching the offering with counter service with basic Japanese fares,  I knew this will be a place that does not cater to me since my vision of ramen restaurant and sushi is drastically different.   Ramen and sushi is passable and for newbies who just recently got introduced to Asian fares.  Great place for kids.  NOT for me."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have gone after a ling day of work and the messed up my Veggie Bowl. Whhhyyyyyyy !!!  You did not give me half of the veggies I asked for Mercedes !!!!   Whhyyyyy Mercedes do you hate me? You dont know me for crap. Why were you so friendly to the everyone but me today. I was watching you the entire time, Yes I was watching. You did not smile or even speak to me nice as you did others after me. The point is CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU WALK OUT AND GET HOME !! Twice you failed me . Whyyy !!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a Saturday. There is a sign encouraging you not to freak out by the long line because it goes fast. But there was no line. I was excited to make my own bowl, which I and my lunch partner did.  I had a tofu and noodles bowl with lots of veggies and a teriyaki sauce billed as \"spicyaki\". It wasn't that spicy.  

Over all, it was ok.  Better than a buffet but not as good as I had expected.  

The bowl was about $7.45 or so plus what they charged extra for pineapple. The pineapples  was sliced very thin. 

I was really excited about trying this place.  If I could give it 3.5 stars, that would be a better rating according to my standards, which highly prioritize value and variety. I give it a 4 instead of a 3 because the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I was excited for a new place to try near work. The restaurant is beautiful, staff friendly. I signed up online before I went over and received a free starter for signing up. I'm not very adventurous to try new things but I did and the flavors just weren't for me. I'll definitely stay in my safe zone and get the teriyaki chicken and veggies next time."}
{"text":"Easily customizable meals. Pick what you want from the menu, and that's how they will make it. Choose from poke bowls, teriyaki bowls, bento box, etc. Ambiance is nice, we had great service and loved the food. Everyone was able to get what they wanted. Two of us wanted poke bowls, and two do not like raw fish, this was the perfect place for everyone to be happy."}
{"text":"The food here is sub par at best. I ordered the lettuce wraps. I love lettuce wraps and have never had one I didn't like...until now. The rice noodles (usually served crisp) are cold and wet. They tasted like dishwater and felt like worms in my mouth. The \"fresh\" shredded carrots were dried out and white. They also tasted like dishwater. The peanut sauce was a 5 out of 10 at most. It was very basic and tasted like it came from a can. The lemon grass sauce was so gross the only thing I can compare it to is vomit. Looked like it too! The teas are \"organic\" but super BASIC. I think they should go check out the teas at Zuppa's and Panera if they want to charge over $3 for a small. If it cost a $1.50 I wouldn't have felt so ripped off as there was nothing special. The chicken portion was VERY small (only about 2 or 3 oz) and the meat itself was flavorless. My friend got a bento box and the pot stickers (ordered pan seared) were white and limp. They felt like you put a condom in your mouth and they had HUGE chunks of onions that overpowered the whole dish. The dipping sauce was below average. Pei Wei tastes better for less money. The rice and cucumber salad were OK but nothing special. 

The staff was nice and the place was clean. 

I am not a Vegan or anything like that and I expect a lot out of expensive food. This place is not worth it. My lunch cost $16 and I couldn't even eat it. I recommend you drive 10 more feet to Pei Wei and get good tasty food at a reasonable price :) Also, you can get the best lettuce wraps I have ever had for less than $16 at the Cheesecake factory. 

This was my 1st and last experience with Tokyo Joe's."}
{"text":"Great amazing healthy delicious options.. Nice choices sushi made to order..no factory farmed meat here..fresh organic vegetables great customization..ambiance way above all walk up and order places..amazing and friendly service!  Great Prices for fresh healthy food..what more can you ask for?  Love this place!! Love the Tataki Salad and all Sushi options too!"}
{"text":"The line was ridiculously long, and there were no obvious signage to indicate where the line started. I had to tell 2 different people they were waiting in the wrong line (to pick up food, not to order). I expected the food to taste better, especially with such a long wait. The food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. Somehow my noodles ended up being very soggy and tasteless. I have no intention of going back."}
{"text":"In search of choices for different meats, fish, poultry, sauces etc. for your bowl - Tokyo Joe's is a top spot for freshness, quality and price! My first visit was a huge surprise! The gluten free sauce and rice noodles were perfection and the mahi mahi was spiced just right! I walked out with 4 meals under $35 total and the family was very happy!"}
{"text":"A little pricy, but the food was good. I would prefer they give more food in the large bowl because I left  hungry. Also, the sushi is really bad here. They need new chairs because of the horrible sound they make when you try to move them."}
{"text":"My bowl was mediocre- I got the surf and turf bowl. The bowl had more rice than anything. Minimal meat."}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's is fast food... pricey fast-food, but great quality.  The restaurant itself could be slightly cleaner (the tables remind me of a Subway restaurant), but the food is great and the service is very friendly.  I had the salmon poki bowl and was pleasantly surprised.  Usually poki bowls are tiny with miniature portions of each ingredient and way too expensive for the quantity that you get, but my salmon poki bowl had a huge heap of fresh-tasting salmon, edamame, and mango, with wasabi on the side.  I even had enough for a mid-shift snack.

I grabbed a loyalty card, so I bet I'll find my way back soon!"}
{"text":"My new go to place! The staff was very friendly at explaining all the choices even though it was picked! Love the vibes and the food was AMAZING!

***REVIEW UPDATE***
I was very disappointed with the quality of online ordering. I had ordered kids meals & then get home & have to deal with a screaming 3 year old because they forgot to it her cookie in the bag & also forgot to give me the drink for her. I did call the restaurant and got a refund for the kids meals but every time I have gone back since my 1st review it has such a different vibe. I definitely don't feel like returning."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice now. Had the Salmon Bowl both times with different sauces and I must admit, it is very good for a chain restaurant. Good kids food as well. Definitely a better option than the hooters wanna-be or the chipotle wanna-be next door."}
{"text":"So, so yummy! The sushi was delicious, not \"fishy\". The teriyaki bowl was good, the vegetables fresh. Priced reasonably!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to what the hype was about. Food was good. We had 2 Poke bowls. Place was not too busy but about 20 min to get the bowls. Not sure why, might have been short staffed. The girls at the front were very friendly and helpful. Great clean place. Really was more 4.5."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw this place opening. Tokyo Joes was highly recommended by some friends in Colorado, where it originated. I was a tad disappointed. I had teriyaki chicken and it reminded me a bit of Kyoto Bowl... Which was not what I was expecting. It wasn't terrible, I just thought it would be different."}
{"text":"Quick update. Chandler location of Ray /10 is so much better than my previously reviewed location! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Gross. Don't waste your money or time. Had a chicken bowl with curry and vegetables, no taste but extremely spicy. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome!!!!
I can't tell you enough how excited I am to have found a place that has gluten free teriyaki chicken! Not only is it gf, it's wonderful!!! So delicious! 
You're not getting fine dining, but it's a great little place for lunch or dinner. And with pretty good prices! 
They're healthier, and have better options too. 
I walked in and definitely wasn't expecting such a quiet and well decorated atmosphere, especially for some little restaurant on a corner.
Good food, good prices, good customer service!
And never too busy.
I've been here during dinner time in a Saturday night, and it's still quite pleasant!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. My order was wrong and i was told they forgot to put the toppings on my roll. The young girl walked away and never said another word. I waited another 3 or 4 times of her walking by before asking if I should be waiting for another roll. Her response was that it was being made but they had other orders to make first. Waited a total of 10 mins before she rudely placed it in front of me. Only gave another star because she left the wrong order on my table. Oh and rolls weren't that bad either. This was my first time trying it out and I don't think I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Ever been to a place you loved so much on the first visit.....you went back the next day?  This is the place!
John built a primo appetizer Poke Roll.  And Brittany gave us super ideas on how to customize our Signature Bowls.  What a delicious meal"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time today and I can guarantee that I'll be back.  Had the Yakitori Bowl that was just outstanding!  Fresh vegetables,  mouth watering chicken and a sauce that I could eat on just about anything.  It's a little pricey for lunch but well worth it. My friend ordered a bowl to her liking and it was full of vegetables and chicken.  Service was quick considering it was lunch time and I appreciate the staff coming around to check on us. Go. Order. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love Tokyo Joe's! I am a huge fan of poke bowls but the hubby is not. Even though Ahi Poke is close by, we choose Tokyo Joe's so that I can get my poke fix and he can order some other stir fried noodle or rice bowl. No matter what you order, everything always tastes fresh and delicious. The staff is always helpful and knowledgeable on the menu (which can be confusing for a newbie). They are also pretty fast so it is a great option for picking up food to go. They recently added online ordering too so that is a huge plus even though I have not used it yet.

The only thing keeping them from five stars is their sushi. I have tried all the rolls and was not a fan of either of them. To be fair, I hate mayo and a lot of them have the chopped fish mixed with a mayo-based sauce. But even the ones that aren't that way, didn't taste very good to me."}
{"text":"It's a cute spot, very clean and quick. I ordered both the poke bowls and was quite excited to try a place near tempe instead of driving to scottsdale. But I was a bit disappointed. The bowl was lacking in fish and ingredients. Only came with avocado and cucumber. A little more sesame seed, seaweed, and possibly sprouts would be nice. 

 There's an addict card you can get for points or something. I like the Monday night special 2 for 1 sushi. Great little spot, but needs a little more for their food. 

It wasn't as busy during the weekend but the parking lot is a bit small so I'm guessing when it's busy times it will be hard to find parking."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, was excited for their concept being so close to home. I ordered a Mojo Bowl with easy brown rice, casher confirmed my request. Obviously someone did not follow through with that request, was delivered with heavy rice. Second issue was my bowl was heavily drenched and over powered with sauce, this ruined my bowl. How about listing sauce amounts on your menu, since I can not count on your cook's judgement. So have a light, medium or heavy sauce option listed, so your customers can be prepared and not surprised, when their order arrives at the table. The heavy sauce defeats the healthy menu you boost, which is what made me excited to have you located in the neighborhood. Make sure you follow through with your customer's orders by actively listening to them, and reading the screen in the back to properly complete their order. The heavy sauce really killed the meal, my friend's bowl had the same issue as well. I will give you a second chance. If you are going to eat here, make sure you tell them how much sauce you want on your food, if you do not want your rice swimming in it."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner time around 6pm. The place was pretty full, looks nice on the inside. They have a sushi type bar on the left and it's a kinda order and sit kind of place. Food was good, I got the chicken noodle bowl. I really liked it, it wasn't too saucy or feel really heavy. Everything seemed pretty fresh. I would definitely come back and maybe try the ramen."}
{"text":"Ordered the Traditional Oyako Dark Chicken Bowl and the Build your own Bento Box.

The Traditional Oyako was pretty good, decent size and quantity amount of food. All dark chicken with 2 eggs and plenty of sauce which I like over White rice. All the different items really mixed together well.

The build your own Bento Box is a pretty good deal at $9, where you select different meats, rice, and other items to your liking because we always want something different. 

You come in and order at the counter and they give you a number and bring the food to your table.

The restaurant has a 'made to order\" sushi area, a soda dispenser and a Tea Bar.

I was pretty pleased with our food and the restaurant for fast food which I think is a step above Waba and Samurai Sams."}
{"text":"Nice Clean Restaurant Like a quick rice bowl place with appetizers, made to order sushi, custom bowls, salads and Bento Box.

Was in a hurry and did not want to eat much so I ordered the build your own bowl with Dark Meat Chicken, white rice and Teriyaki Sauce. 

They did a good job with good portion of chicken and Teriyaki Sauce. I like to mix my bowl of rice with the sauce so that all the rice has some Teriyaki Sauce and there was enough to cover all the rice.

I am not familiar with the area but looks like a newer small plaza with Tokyo Joes, Jersey Mike's Subs and Floyd's Barbershop.

Nice quick place to grab a fast bite"}
{"text":"Location: it was nearby I-10 and Ray. The restaurant was pretty easy to spot from the street. It has lots of seating area for tables of 2 to 4. Next to the soda station, there are folks, knives, napkins. On the table, they have hot sauce in small packages. 

Service: you basically purchase your meal and they deliver the food to your table. Staffs were very friendly. 

Food: I ordered the chicken ramen noodles and it was actually pretty decent. The chicken was tender but the soup base was a bit flavorless. Noodles was average. 

Rating: I'll come back here again to try other dish and sushi combo."}
{"text":"Tokyo Joe's is definitely a good spot to grab a quick bite to eat. My mom & I have gone here for lunch a few times during the work week. We have had everything from the bento boxes to the bowls. I love getting their salmon bowl with my favorite choices in there. It always tastes delicious! The staff is very friendly as well. They dont rush you & they explain how their menu works. Also they serve beer if you'd like a drank. Very good!"}
{"text":"Great spot for fast healthy inexpensive lunch or sushi (cooked and raw options). I Instantly liked the modern Asian decor. I was alone and there is lots of single seating at the bar counter that wraps the perimeter of the seating area.

Good selection of iced teas and even a caffeine free raspberry ice tea with good flavor. I tried the 4 piece sushi \"Crab cheese wonton roll\" for $4.50. Good flavor and served attractively on a black square plate with chopsticks. I found the soy sauce too salty and wished they had a low sodium version.

It does get noisy during the busy lunch hour, but I'm sure I'll come back as they have lots of vegetarian options."}
