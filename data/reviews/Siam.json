{"text":"Food is good, loved the curry. The decor is great. The place is super busy, so service is a little slow. Make sure you reserve. Prices are a bit high, but seems to be a standard in dix30."}
{"text":"Great dinner and great signature cocktails! 
Rather expensive however, not a place I would go back frequently for that only reason."}
{"text":"If u like overpaying .... Then this is the place  for you.  The decor is amazing.  The food.... Not do much!!  Three pieces of chicken in your Tom yum soup ... Size of a rice bowl.  All the meat and tofu in the pad thai was cooked and then deep fried.... It was hard and dry and not much favor.  Mango salad ....stay away....beef salad ....was Not Thai beef.... Don't know what it was.  The red curry chicken was good.  Beef jerky was good but not enough for the price.  Breaded shrimp and wings were good.  Service was mediocre.....waited long time for drinks appetizers and even longer for the entrees. If you are on a date and don't want to talk to them .... Then this is the place .... Loud music and talking. We were practically screaming at each other."}
{"text":"With its darkly draped interior and golden mood lighting, moody, sexy, contemporary, and \"Zen-like\" is how I'd describe the vibe of this restaurant.  The atmosphere is modern yet warm and would be perfect to impress a new date, ignite the passion with your current mate (it can get a little loud, though), go for a night out on the town with some friends, or catch up with the girls (which was my case).

The service was professional and courteous.  We were informed that the menu is conducive to sharing, so my friend and I ordered the chicken satay and shrimp wrapped in pastry to start.  The presentation was very appealing; the appetizers came out on \"lollipop\" style a wooden plank.  The satay came with a creamy peanut sauce and the shrimp came in a sweet and spicy one.  Both plates came accompanied with sweet and spicy cucumbers and onions, which was as great as a palate cleanser as it was a refreshing mini side-salad (for us, we're small girls!).  My only complaint with these dishes were that they were room temperature, and that the shrimp were skewered in such a way that made them a little awkward for dipping.  

For mains, we ordered the red curry and rad na (beef and noodles with broccoli), and both came with an order of rice.  The red curry had crisp slivers of red pepper, green beans, chicken, and eggplant, and swam in a rich broth of red curry and coconut milk.  It was an instant winner with my girl friend.  Although the menu indicated \"2 chillies,\" it really wasn't very spicy at all.  Given that my friend doesn't like heat, it was fine for the two of us, but I recommend asking for a spicier dish if you like it hot.  As for the rad na, this was my favourite, perhaps because I rarely order dishes that are sweeter rather than spicy.  I'd recommend it, however, my other complaint was that we were not given serving spoons/forks, and had to ask for knives as well.  

I'd like to comment on the drink menu and their desserts, but we were simply too stuffed to have any, and ended up packing two \"to-go\" bags at the end of the night (props for good portion sizes).  The night out ended up costing us 70 dollars (without tip, drinks, or dessert), so the place is a little steeper in prices than a regular night out.

I would definitely recommend this place again, and look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the food is quite good. Not for regular visits but good alternative if you can't decide where to eat."}
{"text":"We are not in Thailand to have the best thai food but this restaurant offers very tasty entrees and main dishes , their mango and papaya salads are very good very well spiced and their main curry dishes with coconut sauce are really good , a place to try , I just loved this modern place in quartier dix30 and will sure come back !"}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant the serviceis also great. Their Cari is really good so is their Pad Sew, the crispy chicken was disapointing . Their wine list is a bit on the expensive side and i suggest you share your food because portions are quite big. In all nice restaurant, great service, food is good not great and prices a bite expensive."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is pricey!
Yes the drinks are pricey!
Yes this place may not be Authentic Thai!

But this place is hands down the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Siam has a cool, modern and contemporary ambiance that adds a really nice vibe to your dining experience. 

The service was great. A lot of the restaurants we went to in Montreal didn't have good service, but this restaurant's service was probably the best service we had in Montreal.  We didn't have to flag down anyone for water. The waiter was very helpful and answered all our questions.

We went here with four friends and we all decided to start off by sharing appetizers. So we started off with the Degustation platter, which includes Spring Rolls, Chicken Satay, Duck Wontons, Imperial Rolls, and Wrapped Shrimps ($35). All of the food in the degustation platter were good, but the Duck Wontons were my favorite.  I just wished I would've had more, but then again its great I didn't because I wouldn't have room for our entrees.

For our entree we ordered 1 order of Chef Panithit's Crispy Chicken ($24) (Battered, fried chicken, chili paste and garlic) and 2 orders of Roasted Duck in Red Curry ($25 each) ( Roasted duck, cherry tomatoes, Thai eggplants, lychees, pineapples, red curry, kaffir lime leaves and basil.) The Crispy chicken was amazing. I will never go to KFC again! It was perfectly crispy and extremely flavorful. The red curry roasted duck was perfect. It was extremely flavorful and had a nice kick to it. The portions size were reasonable and we all left full and happy. We couldn't even finish all our food. We had to take some food to go.

The next time i'm in Montreal, I will definitely go back to this place. I'm so glad that my friends took us here, otherwise we wouldn't have ever known to go based on the yelp reviews. I'm shocked that i'm the only one on yelp who gave this place a 5 star review. Please listen to me and check this place out. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner with work colleagues. The chicken satay and cashew chicken were awesome and the atmosphere is great!  Great service and handling of a group of 7 individual checks.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great decor, very cozy restaurant, nice staff and good location for those who live around Brossard. I had Yellow Curry. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but I liked it. Usually I have Yellow curry with coconut milk, so I missed the taste of coconut. But this is a very personal opinion. :) 
My husband had padseew and he liked a lot. 
Restaurant is very pricey for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Had a really good first impression of the restaurant. It seemed very cozy and modern. Location was nice, with the exception it being slightly confusing to find, especially if it's your first time there, as it is on the second floor. 
The food took longer than usual to come out, but the service was still great. 
The food was definitely not 100% traditional Thai food. The pad Thai I ordered was not spicy enough and didn't taste like real pad Thai. Still good noodles though. 
Things were slightly overpriced, but considering the location it was probably necessary."}
{"text":"Over priced restaurant compare the food quality.
Food is not authentic.
You pay for Embience.
Want to enjoy terrace, ok.
If you are hungry, don't go. LOL."}
{"text":"It seems like all the restaurants in Dix30 are cookie cutout restaurants in the square. Siam is one of the restaurants in the square that has a terasse. Located on the second floor, the decor was exquisite-meeting traditions of thai with modern elegance. We didn't need reservations to get a table- I don't think that's the case with any of the these dix30 square restaurants.

The menu is definitely pricey for the quality of food. Cocktails start at 11$, wines start at 16$ a glass. I originally ordered the night in thailand but they ran out of carnation milk. So I picked the mai thai- which was ok. The cocktails were definitely NOT the game player of Siam. 

We ordered a taster sampler- that included 3 of each of the following-spring rolls (quite small), chicken wings, chicken skewers, coconut style shrimp tempura and spring rolls- for 39$ for the whole sampler- this was comparable to a KFC 5$ bucket. None of these flavours stood out- and for the price I was paying I would've appreciated more pieces and dipping sauce considering at cost- these guys are making a lot of money off this dish! Be nice!

For our mains: we did the cod yellow curry (3/5) the cod was well cooked and served on a bed of fried rice noodles (cute). The red duck curry (3/5) was served in a coconut cream sauce with lychees and pineapples- the duck was well done. The chicken cashew stole the show (4/5) I enjoyed the presentation in a metallic stir fry pan and the flavours were bold and not too spicy. The cashews and mushrooms in this dish were subtle. 

A turnoff to most of these restaurants in dix30-the servers don't speak a word of English or poor attentive skills. We asked if the jasmine rice that comes with the dish is served in a traditional thai woven basket-waitress had nodded. This was not the case- we got jasmine rice served in regular bowls. I get this is not a big issue for most but, we ended up ordered an additional sticky rice for 1.00$ because she could not make a word of what we asked. Another server had to come in to rectify the situation and give us additional utensils.

Topping at 70$ pp, this was not worth any of it, too pricey for a fancy dining hall with mediocre quality food."}
{"text":"Visited here with a large group, we were in for a drawn out experience.  The service was a bit slow, friendly but slow.  We were not the only large party, and I think they were understaffed.  The food did not disappoint, we started with great appetizers, I most enjoyed the spring rolls and the fried dumpling.  For dinner I ordered a sea bass dish not at all what I expected.  The spicy sauce was great, the fish came out head, tail, skin and bones.  I ate it, but I had to fight three bones, I wouldn't fight that again.  We skipped desert because it got so late."}
{"text":"I agree with most reviews here, very cool decor and contemporary ambiance, it is not like most Asian restaurants. I guess they are trying to make the menu trendy, the food does not really feel very authentic, I mean I don't think you will get served pumpkin soup in Thailand. This means that you are once again basically having Asian cuisine adapted for North Americans, that being said I though it was good but pricey for what you get. I wouldn't mind going back but will not go out of my way for it"}
{"text":"Beau décor et bonne nourriture mais les prix sont excessifs. Un pad thaï aux crevettes pour 22$, c'est un peu onéreux. Grand restaurant donc très bruyant. Riz servi dans bol ébréché donc pas top pour la présentation."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Great service. Appetizers were well done. The spring rolls were steamed which were okay but would have liked them fried. Skewers are good. Alex gave us great service. Crispy chicken dish was really good. Duck was spicy and excellent. Both pad Thai and other noodle dish were tasty. Ask for some hot chilies with your dishes. Sangria was really good too Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! We go there at least once a month. If you like a little more on the spicy side you must try the chicken wings which we order every single time we go there."}
{"text":"Was dying for a pad Thai so came for lunch. Siam has a decent Pad Thai, not the best, but definitely far from the worst. I asked for extra spicy and couldn't detect any spice at all. Came with a Tom Yum soup which was also good. The lunch time service is slow however, about 30 minutes to get your food after ordering when the restaurant wasn't very busy. So don't count on getting in and out in less than an hour. A little on the pricey side ($20 for a shrimp pad Thai). Overall a good Upscale a Thai restaurant on the south shore."}
{"text":"Exquisite flavors! Really delicious Thai flavors in unique preparations of favorite dishes. And great service and atmosphere. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Très agréable! L'endroit est bien décorer et la terrasse est magnifique."}
{"text":"It was not my first time at Siam. It's situated in the quartier Dix30 in Brossard. Decorations are cozy and modern. I ordered a Pad Thai on their lunch menu. The lunch menu is very reasonable pricing wise. You get a soup or a salad and a coffee or tea with it. 

The Tom yum soup was sweet and spicy as it should be. It's not a spicy that you can't handle; might be a bit soft for someone who can handle their spices but for anyone who doesn't eat spicy it's an enjoyable spicy.
The Pad Thai was decent; to be completely honest it wasn't the best Pad Thai I had in town but it was decent. The noodles were bit too soft to my taste but the shrimp and the taste were fairly good. 

One thing about Siam is it's presentations are top qualities. 
Our Waitress Marie-Chantal was very nice to us. 

Overall it's a nice place to sit down with friends to have some good food or discuss business with co-workers or clients. The ambiance is a delight."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great and it's really nice for the eye. But for the food and the pay you price not so nice. The wine is expensive and the only bottle that was 30$ was disgusting. You really should share your plates cause the waiter didn't tell us and we had way to much. The ginger chicken was good but not for the price and the chicken of the chef is just panned i didn't even find the chicken. Also the salad doesn't included lettuce and is way to much spicy. My friend returned her plate cause it wasn't good an she got something else to eat when all our plates were gone. The service wasn't that good also. The presentation of the mediocure food  was unbelievable though. 

Really just a trendy place where you go to look around but not to enjoy the food. It would of been better and cheaper a little Thai restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love the Zen decor. Can not wait for the terrase to open."}
{"text":"Siam has a rich decor which envelops you as soon as you step in. It is an ideal setting to create memories and it would be complete if only the food was as memorable; while I believe Siam deserves its 5 stars for the atmosphere (music, decor and service), it would get a decent yet average 3 star rating from me in the food department. A polite and pleasant waiter served food which was overpriced and, unfortunately, a bit heavy on the stomach. Nonetheless, my fiancé and a friend, with whom I shared the only 3 available vegetarian dishes available, had a good time, and so did I! If you have some space left at the end of your meal, I recommend the chocolate cake with coco ice cream; good enough for me to concede and round up the rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Modern thai place. I had a great experience with family here. Ordered shrimp in puff pastry(more like phyllo or wanton wrapped) this was the least of our favorite. Had 4 entrees to share, duck in curry, beef in curry, padthai and crispy chicken.  Duck in curry had lychee and pineapple was on the seeet savory side, duck was like the chinese toast duck. Beef was moist and tender, curry sayce with it was amazing. Padthai was on the sweeter side was really good. Crispy chicken was a mountain of chicken. Cant say more. Unlimited jasmine rice by the way. And they had a sick rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food great outdoor seating.  Waiters were great at accommodating vegetarians.  Get the house siracha!"}
{"text":"Siam delivers average Asian food in a chic pretentious ambiance to justify its inflated prices. The food is okay - some dishes are better than others, namely the chicken skewers and pad thai - but for the most part it's just \"okay\". 

That would be fine if the decor was unpretentious and the prices reasonable, but 120$ for an average meal without alcohol is just too much. There's so many wonderful reasonably-priced Asian restaurants that Siam just isn't worth it.

One last note: the crispy chicken is just a weak attempt at a General Tso chicken with terrible batter and a sauce with no kick. Same for the garlic shrimps - the batter spoils the whole thing."}
{"text":"Generally its a overpriced Thai restaurant. The only good thing about this Thai restaurant is the decor. It's nice and romantic. However, I was pretty disappointed about the food here. The Tom yum soup is way too different from it supposed to be tasted like. In addition, I paid $10 just for a tiny bowl of soup. I had crispy chicken which tasted like dry version of general Tao. Red curry duck was ok. But.... Can u imagine a fancy Thai restaurant doesn't have Thai tea... The spring rolls are way too expensive. I can have like 20 spring rolls in Chinatown for the same price and taste. Anyway, it's a great place to sit, talk and have some drinks, but definitely not a ideal place to enjoy real Thai food."}
{"text":"Slow service, not busy but it took 20-25mins to get a small plate of pad Thai....definitely not returning for mediocre food with small portions and huge prices."}
{"text":"I'm picky and can't eat wheat and afraid of trying new things, so I was hesitant to try it, but from appetizers to dessert, not only was I able to find things to eat, but they were delicious. Fresh food, great flavors. Everyone loved their food. I'll definitely be back!"}
