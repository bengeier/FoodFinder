{"text":"The food was decent, and came out quick. I thought the menu was a little busy for how limited it was. Only a couple items were listed on each page, the rest of the page was covered with some trivial information on a Fox Sports announcer. This made the rather small menu take up several pages."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Had to wait 20 mins before the waitress came over. We were almost about to leave. Will probably never go back, much better bars around the area than this one."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour and tv's everywhere you turn!!! Love that there is NO cover charges for fights like UFC, unlike other bars I been too! And on top of all that, Great food! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Fox Sports Grill several times. Usually before a concert at jobing.com arena right next door. The people are much nicer than at the Scottsdale location! It's a great spot to go watch a Suns game too. We even went the night before the Super Bowl and only had a 10 min wait, that was pretty amazing.    I would recommend their apps if you need something quick. They have good burgers and salads as well. And as Gretchen L mentioned the fiber-optic-like bar is way cool, you may be distracted enough to forget what your drink order was going to be! The huge screen is amazing- it's like a smaller version of a movie screen."}
{"text":"Loaded nachos are not good. Cheap beef and cheap processed cheese sauce. Watch the game and have a beer is all one should do."}
{"text":"So we had an hour to kill before our flight and decided fox grill looked like the best option. The last time we ate at the airport, it was an overpriced and underwhelming experience. So, we really didn't get our hopes up.   We order some beers, wings and a chicken Caesar. The beers were delicious (of course). The wings were surprisingly yummy. We got half BBQ and half buffalo. They were crispy and perfectly cooked. The chicken Caesar was also good. Overall we were both surprised.   For airport food, I give it a definite thumbs up. The service was a bit slow, but the beer made up for it."}
{"text":"So Fox Sports Grill has become The Canyon Grill....new concept with live music venue, same very very disappointing food. An upscale looking place in an upscale location should serve at least half way upscale food.....I would rather eat at Chili's . It is too bad because the ambiance and viewing options are great. PLEASE change the menu, change the food quality, change the chef."}
{"text":"Where is the zero? The waitress who worked our table was such a b!tch that we left.  I was really hungry too so it had to be way over the top rude.  I hope they aren't all like her."}
{"text":"With a billiards room, putting green, cigar bar and posh lounge areas, the multimillion dollar north Scottsdale sports bar is by far the most upscale \"sports bar\" in Arizona. Like Barcelona, you're sure to fun into your fair share of cougars and sugar daddy's who want to show off their new Mercedes and Hummer's in the parking lot for all to see."}
{"text":"We sat at the outer \"patio\" and had to search for the waitstaff more than once. When I finally found the one of two servers and asked if there was a waitress for the outer \"patio\" I was told, \"yes there is\" and she promptly walked away. Horrible service. Eat TCBY instead. The management should clean house and get rid of these two worthless servers ASAP!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre but it's great to stop in here to get some beer.  That is what I did but I wanted to get some dinner too.  Took a while to get my beer and took even longer to get my food.  Almost 25 minutes.  This is an airport! People are trying to catch their flight.  At least 3 ppl who were  seated after me, got their food before I did.  I finished my beer before food came out.  Not only did it take long, the kitchen made the wrong thing and my waitress didn't catch it until I asked her what she just put in front of me.  I ordered chicken brie and some how it was translated to roast beef sandwich.  Ughh....  I was cutting close to missing my flight so I just manned up and ate it anyways and ran to my terminal.  BOOO!"}
{"text":"The breakfast food served when I ordered the scrambled eggs combo was probably scooped out of a buffet style bin dropped here several hours (or even the day before) earlier.  The eggs were cool, toast wouldn't melt the butter, bacon was tough and room temperature.   However, credit to my waitress for removing it and serving me (by request) a fresh fruit cup.  Really lousy food at high prices."}
{"text":"Want to watch a game from another area?  This is the place to go.  They have feeds from all the regional Fox Sports networks, and have access to a lot of games that are not on the ESPN channels.   It is a large restaurant with a number of different viewing areas, so check and see if your game is on one of the TV's.  If not, they will try to find it for you.  That said, the food is so-so.  It is typical sports bar food, with a wide assortment from burgers, sandwiches, pizza, etc.  The service is a bit slow, but you're here to watch a game, so you hardly notice - unless your team is losing.   When we first came in it took a while for a waitress to notice us.  Not being bashful, we immediately found one, and ordered our drinks.  We then started our search of the various rooms to see if our game was on somewhere.  It wasn't, but the bartender immediately arranged to have one of the TV's switched to our game.  We had a large table of people, and one server took our order for food, and another server brought it out.  Needless to say, there was a lot of confusion as to who got what.  Once we all got situated, we had quite an enjoyable time.  Of course, our team won  - and that makes all the difference in the world."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now for lunch. Big fan of the blue cheese chips for an appetizer (which is huge) and am hooked on it. Buffalo chicken sandwich is also good...portion size is good and the service has been pretty good every time but once. There was a little snafu where our meals came just a few minutes after our appetizer. A different server brought the food to us, realized we weren't ready and rushed it back in the kitchen, where it sat and got cold. Other than that, it's a nice place to go for lunch. Really sucks reading the comments about the night life there. I honestly never thought a place like that would be where I'd plan on driving to show off a Ferrari and impressing people...disappointing to hear, but welcome to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"i wont lie when i say i expected a little more. the food was nothing special but i suppose it could have been worse. the  place is very spacious and cool. which is nice when its 105 outside. the service was decent, and it wasnt too overpriced. the big TVs are a nice touch and i can assume being there on an NFL sunday would probably be fun. but to sum it all up, its seems like the kind of place id for sure go to if i was a sports agent on a business lunch. its as classy as sports bars get."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich here and a side salad. It was definitely one of the worst sandwiches I've had. The ingredients were fine as far as freshness and quality, but the flavors were so boring and plain. A child could make me a better tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"Take note of the string of bad reviews recently posted...and respond accordingly by not patronizing this horrible establishment. Bad service and worse food. Everything is way over priced and disgusting. On a bright note, my server cared about her appearance as she spent the entire time at our table staring into the mirror on the wall behind us..."}
{"text":"If you find yourself hungry in PHX sky harbor airport before a morning flight, look somewhere else.  The breakfast is TERRIBLE.  I ordered a scramble and it was clearly made long before I ordered.  The food arrived cold, and cold scrambled eggs aren't very tasty.  The service was mediocre at best.  tl;dr: It may be a decent place for a drink before your flight, but if you're hungry, there is better/cheaper food on any airplane."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck. Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people????"}
{"text":"Why, oh why, the three stars?  Simply because it doesn't fit its name I suppose.    When I visit a Sports Grill I expect bar food...appetizers like friend mozzerella and wings, not calamari and filet mignon chili.  Really, would you trust calamari from a sports grill?  Now that I've got that out there... I like it.  The atmosphere is nice.  I like the set up with the cozy tables, the activity of the televisions and the other patrons that gives a subtle background noise but doesn't distract from your own evening.  I guess I don't look around that much any more since I haven't noticed the other patrons...which seem to be a focus of other reviews.  The service is decent; nothing overly impressive but you won't die of thirst.  The cleanliness/decor is nice.  The food is tasty, just not what you'd expect from a bar and grill."}
{"text":"I love fake boobs and I love rich old dudes and I REALLY LOVE out of control Scottsdaleness, so the Fox Sports Grill is pretty much like Disneyland for me.   Go for the cougars, stay for the Sunday Bloody Mary Bar. Good times for all.  I'm not being sarcastic."}
{"text":"I don't usually review based on one visit.  But when the experience and food is as bad as this, I'll make an exception...  This place gets two stars for the multiple big screen TVs.  If you're here strictly to watch sports and have a beer or three,  you'll be fairly happy.  However, I came here for a bite to eat, and that's when there where I ran into problems.  The bartenders are a disgruntled lot.  Their sour mood when I sat down set the tone for my whole experience here.  They're not all bad.  One of the male bartenders actually smiled occasionally and chatted with some of  the customers.  The food.  How can you screw up cole slaw?  What more can I say?   Beyond that, if you're in the area to watch a game, this isn't a bad choice.  Just swing by McDonald's or somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Totally disgusting overpriced caesar salad alert!"}
{"text":"This place left a bad taste in my mouth. We made the mistake of going on father's day with my best friend's dad (his choice). The place was nearly empty and it still took almost an hour to get our food. We had to ask management if we'd been forgotten. The group that came in after us were served well before us, even though I'm pretty sure they put their order in a few minutes after ours.  I ordered BBQ chicken nachos, thinking they would be nachos with barbecued chicken. That makes sense, right? I got chicken on top of chips covered in BBQ sauce. It's my fault. I come from a place where barbecue is a method, not necessarily a flavor.   Minus a star for the bad food. Minus two stars for the terrible service. And minus a star for being Fox.   Sorry, that's how I roll."}
{"text":"Eat, drink and watch the game of your choice in an upscale setting without moving your head or having to make eye contact with those at your table. It's brilliant, really.   In my seat at Fox Sports Grill in Glendale's Westgate complex I had a view of 8 different TVs.  While it's smaller than the Scottsdale sister location, it's still rather spacious with four elevated dining areas overlooking the main bar and giant TV screen.  But it doesn't have the billiards, putting green or cigar lounge like its crosstown sister.  Your standard pub fare was average at best.  Nachos with colorful chips and grilled chicken and hot wings were ok-tasting. My chipotle pulled pork sandwich was intensely spicy, almost too much to the point where I stopped eating it.  And that's a rare moment.   Our server was kind of a space cadet.  He came to take our order and upon hearing the first person's order of hot wings he took off without hearing the rest of our orders and the fact that we wanted it ALL to come out at once.  We didn't see him for another five minutes so we could then complete our order.  If you're looking for something discerning on tap here, you're going to be at a loss.  Sam Adams and Blue Moon Hef is as exotic as it gets.  Setting - 4 stars Service - 2 stars Food - 2.5 stars  The crowd here is visibly different - think local girls/guys on dates, tables full of teens, families, groups of 30-something bachelor dudes and of course, your snowbird tourists. No cougars on the prowl here, and that was on a Saturday night at 10 pm.  Damn, I really wanted to see some cougar prowling.  And back toward Scottsdale we went."}
{"text":"Landed in Phoenix today and was starving after we checked into our hotel. I passed by a FOX Sports Grill and I remembered a recent post by home skillet Todd B. TB enjoyed catching games at FOX in Seattle, so I decided to step into his shoes for a minute.  Awesome setup, a fat bar in the middle with 10-15 big screens mounted all around. The centerpiece was a flatscreen that had to be 300\". There were a few pool tables and a bunch of side rooms that were furnished as lounges, that I imagined as perfect for holding fantasy football drafts.  I ordered a BBQ Cheddar Bacon Burger and a side wedge salad. The burger was awesome, cooked perfect. Obviously freshly ground beef. They also have my fave brew on tap, Blue Moon.  A bad ass place to eat, drink and be merry while a big game on the tube. And most importantly, it puts the ESPNZone to shame..."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Fox Sports Grill for a year and yesterday I decided to go there for my birthday dinner.  Wow, I was disappointed.  They totally changed out the menu selection.  They changed from a high end American cuisine to a regular bar type food.  TGI Friday have more selection then them.  I ordered a Kobe Beef slider and I didn't care for it.  Also, only little amount of fries came with it.  Plus the service was slow.  The whole restaurant seems to be empty.  After dinner with friends, we went over to the bar side of the restaurant.  There was a live band performing but hardly anyone was there.  They have tons of nice flat screen and few pool table.  I definitely don't recommend the food.  But if you want the whole restaurant to yourself then I guess that will be alright."}
{"text":"This is pretty posh as sports bars go.  Maybe I'm just getting old but I really appreciated the comfortable seating and civilized atmosphere last weekend for college football.  Plenty of big tv screens and the volume was just right.  Way different from the usual extremely noisy, crowded, standing room only atmosphere I'm more used to at a sports bar on game day.    There are a number of tasty food options here, including their delicious sweet potato fries and the genius barbecue chicken nachos.  Yum!!  I was also really impressed with the service, given how crowded the place was during the game.  Whenever we needed something, it was easy to track down the waitress and she got everything right, including splitting up the bill into different amounts on all of our credit cards.    The one time I was here for happy hour, around 5:00 on a Thursday a while back, it was pretty dead.  I wouldn't come back for happy hour, but I'd definitely return to watch a game."}
{"text":"Solid 2.5 star airport restaurant. Generally, ths place is dirty and the food is marginal. However, the C terminal offers very little in terms of real food. I was very happy with the service.....just wish they'd do a serious re-model on the 80's sportsbar motif."}
{"text":"The place did not care about a regular customer. The service has gone downhill. The food is like any other bar. OK this is what happened... I went in this place with my daughter to eat and watch a playoff game. It was happy hour. The playoff game was being played in the other room, not the bar area. I got seated and wanted to order the happy hour menu. I was told that I could not because it was only in the bar area. They refused outright and no exceptions. So I said to switch the game in the bar area (with sound) and I will most gladly move. NO, NEVER, I was told. They saw me walk out the door and was not even sorry. This place has really gone downhill and never experienced anything like this. There are so many other places in the area, and someone really wanted my business. Never again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday and it was just fine.  I had the Club and asked for the sweet potato fries.  Service was fine as well.  Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"What's not to love?  You have big screen tv's with every sport imaginable, a huge selection of beers, good food, a cool lounge setting, uber-hot waitresses and beautiful people packed around the bar.  This was one of the better hangout spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE Fox Sports Grill.  Its the perfect combination of 2 of my favorite things: beautiful people and (midwest) sports.    Belly up to the bar in the middle of the restaurant for the best people and sports watching seats in the house--there are a ton of TVs so you wont miss a minute of your favorite games, even if youre cheering for more than one team at a time.    There are pool tables for your entertainment at half time, and a private room in the back where I once got way too saucy at a company gathering.    DJs are mixing the latest during commercials of REALLY big games, and Fox Sports broadcasts right in the bar from time to time.    Prices are Scottsdale par and the food is upscale bar.    Be sure you shower and put on your best jersey, there are some seriously good looking sports fans at Fox Sports and hell, you might even be cheering for the same team."}
{"text":"Very trendy bar.  Sports motif [obviously].  The food is decent, but overpriced.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The bar section is pricey as well, but they do have a few pool tables if you like to shoot, and that area is very well laid out."}
{"text":"Great burgers, plenty of tvs for all the games!  This place would be crazy during a football game, or any sports game that matters (oh, wait, I already said football).  There isn't a bad seat in the house, there is a lounge if you just want to kick back on a couch and watch game with a frosty cold one.  Definitely a place worth going for good food, good sports, and cold beer."}
{"text":"This place DESTROYS any other quick-dine at every airport I've been to around the planet in terms of quality of food and making it not feel like you're waiting for the 3:35 to Tulsa for some lame family thing.  But take this review with two scoops of salt -- this IS an airport bar after all and drink tabs here add up quicker than Rainman.    First, let me inform you that this spot is in the gate 1-13 (I can't remember how high the gates go before you move over to the neighboring set of gates) in Terminal 4.  Usually the destinations I travel to using Southwest fly out of this area, which is great because I NEED a bloody mary and Terry Bradshaw cheese fries before a flight.  Kind of my tradition I guess, but both are freaking GREAT before a flight.  You can get a double for $1 more to get that extra kick of vodka.  There are a ton of TVs and a whole lot of tables despite its tiny square footage.  Every time I've been in here it was crazy packed, but have had no problem finding a table either immediately, or with in a few minutes.  Turnover and service here is quick.  I will also add that this place, despite its name, is NOTHING like the similar monickered spot in North Scottsdale.  In fact, I wish that the place up north was more casual like this one."}
{"text":"The guilty pleasure of sports bars.  Fox Sports Grill is essentially Half Moon on Creatine (TM) ... from pull taps, to cozier couches, to wider LCD screens, to pricier filets.  But .. you will pay for this luxury.  Catching a full round of NFL playoff games might set you back a cool hundo, so stop fucking placing the Chargers as your ass-end of the trifecta, cos you'll need this disposable loot for your tab.  As per the 'neaveau-posh' sports lounge motif, it is limo-dark and comfortably chilly.  I would go here more often if it wasn't in butt-fuckin-scottsdale."}
{"text":"What sounded like a promising and even delicious burger, the Buffalo Ranch, arrived at my table as a total disappointment. To start with, the \"seasoned\" burger resembled a thick piece of cardboard in both taste and texture. This was topped with soggy shredded lettuce, a flaccid slice of tomato, and a barely detectable dab of buffalo sauce. The creamy ranch dressing and shaved red onion? Non-existent.  Supposedly coupling this culinary disaster were \"seasoned\" fries (when I asked what they were seasoned with, the response was salt and pepper), and a pickle spear (also forgotten).  At least the server Brandon was a nice guy and he offered to remove the burger from my check. For this, and the fact that the place serves beer and has sports on tv, Fox gets two stars."}
{"text":"This place has such a great environment! Its a good place to watch the game and get a beer. The food was okay. I got a buffalo chicken wrap and oh my, way to spicy for me... I had to drench it in ranch to cool it down. So if you like spicy that's a good thing to get. My Fiancee got the Cobb salad and it was tasty! It was inexpensive! Friendly service and I LOVE the environment! Classy but sporty!"}
{"text":"After getting 45 min to 1-hour wait times at Sandbar, Margaritaville, and Yard House (we had a movie to make), we decided to hit up this place and hit jackpot - only a 15 minute wait, spent comfortably at the very cool fiber-optic-like bar (seriously, it's way cool!), sipping cocktails that weren't a huge rip-off and watching The Game on a FRIGGIN HUGE screen. I secretly coveted that screen for my living room, even if it meant getting rid of everything else.   Our server was great, friendly, and quick. Their staff was on the ball; no one was standing around or looked like they'd rather be somewhere else. I ordered the bleu cheese burger with wedge salad (yeah, I like stinky cheese, wanna fight?) and the hub ordered prime rib dip. He said it was pretty good (which from him means, it's great) and my burger was incredible, cooked perfectly to order. The dressing on the salad was a little watery, more like ranch with bleu cheese thrown in, but edible. The lettuce was really fresh.   We were in a hurry, so I asked for our bill when our meals came, and surprisingly, it came within a couple of minutes. The server was our hero; we made our movie, just at the opening credits.   Only caveat... is anyone on staff checking the bathrooms? Paper products eventually do need refills. It's clean, otherwise.   Two enthusiastic thumbs up. It doesn't have the fun and games that the Scottsdale location has, but the service is excellent and the food is good. Plus the giant frickin screen that, one day, will be MINE. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA........"}
{"text":"Come here to watch the game.  Eat elsewhere.    They have a bunch of tvs all over the place, perfect for watching sports, of course.  Went here last week to watch Game 7 of the NBA Finals and sat on what appeared to be the stage area.  Good view of the entire place.    Drinks were ok, thought it was pretty weak, IMHO.  I had 4 cocktails and didn't so much as have a buzz.    The food (if you want to call it that) is atrocious.  We had the BBQ pork sliders, hamburger sliders, nachos and buffalo wings.  The wings were good, but then again, how can anyone really screw that up?  There wasn't enough toppings on the nachos, so halfway through the plate we were pretty much just eating plain chips.  The hamburger sliders were tasteless, dry and rubbery; not even loading them with ketchup and mustard could really save them.  The BBQ pork sliders didn't even taste like they had any sauce on them.  It was like eating boiled, pulled pork that was completely tasteless.    As I said, come for the game, but go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"If you desperately want to impress or be impressed, this is the sports bar for you. I crack up when I see the ferrari's and hummers parked up front. The is your higher end sports bar with a brand name. Girls come here hoping to bump into a celeb or wealthy dude, and guys come here looking for a cute girl who is easily impressed and likes a good time. The rest come here to try to look cool.  The main bar is a long rectangle, with a corresponding open ceiling above with flat screen TV's all around, For pure sports watching, it is not ideal, as it is a bit akward to watch. Most people are watching sports secondarily. The bartenders are more pushy than friendly, pimping drinks to run your tab up. The bar food isn't bad, and it isn't good either.   They do have private side rooms and pool tables enclosed in glass, which are the coolest things in the place but usually always taken. They don't have the private speakered lounge chairs like the ESPN Zone.   There are better neighborhood sports bars throughout Scottsdale and Phoenix with better food, cheaper drinks, and more relaxed for watchng sports. But if you are still trying to be somebody, go here and pretend you are."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I only came in here because I wanted to watch the Seahawks game while waiting for my return flight. I was horrified with the service (the brunette waitress was absent, slow, and it took forever to cash out - which is absurd in an airport restaurant - everyone has somewhere to be)!  The food was terrible, but I wasn't expecting too much.  What was worse, were the PLASTIC UTENCILS. I am not tailgating - I don't want to eat with a plastic fork/knife and plastic plate at a restaurant, not to mention it is simply wasteful.  Walk around to find another TV in the waiting areas that might be playing your game [shudder] - this place is awful."}
{"text":"Ordered nachos...took about 20 mins for it to come out. Sour cream looked like cottage cheese and they use the shredded microwaveable cheese.   The beer is good, can't really go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality  Many of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.  The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.  It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options."}
{"text":"I recognize that airport food doesn't live up to a higher standard, but the \"traditionally prepared hot chicken wings,\" at $11.99 for a dozen wings, was below any standard... It had been a few weeks since I'd last had some wings, one of my favored foods when travelling, and  I was ready to satisfy my desire while waiting for my flight.    How very shocked and appalled I was to find that some fried chicken parts had found their way under a hot sauce dispenser presented before me!  Heck, two of the pieces weren't even touched by the sauce!  It was easily the most grisly attempt at wings that has ever been perpetrated upon an unsuspecting customer and my complaint to the waitress (a fine person in general) was to basically be embarrassed that she had to serve such dreck.  I asked for the wings to go as I could not bring myself to eat them, the establishment wasn't inclined to not charge me for the (I mean it, really) inedible foodstuff, assuming my teenage boys would ensure it wouldn't go to waste.  They wouldn't touch it...   Who knows, perhaps the other food is edible, but I wouldn't risk it..."}
{"text":"Ehhh. I get into PHX from SNA at like 8:30pm and on at least two occasions I've been told that the kitchen is closed, I can only order booze at the bar. Well what the heck, Fox Sports Grill? Here's the deal, in the concourse where FSG is, there are two red eye flights to the east coast, one would think FSG would stay open a little longer than 9pm for food. I'd rather spend my money at FSG than the hotdog/sausage place closer to my gate.  The drinks are good, wait staff are nice and food ok (when you get there early enough). Chicken quesadilla was average, needed some spice."}
{"text":"This is definitely more than just a place to watch the game.  While they have huge TV's everywhere, Fox Sports Grill is also a meat market.  Ladies don't just throw on some sweats and a tank top to come here- they all will be dressed in their trendiest duds and their highest heels.  And guys will be wearing their tightest t-shirts and their spikiest hair.   At night, it becomes more like a nightclub than a sports bar.  They play good music and the place gets packed.  The restaurant side is nice and has separate tables for diners away from the bar.  The food is pretty good too, I liked the linguini.  Drinks aren't cheap, but you're paying more for the upscale atmosphere than anything else.    My advice: If you're looking to get dressed up and hit on guys/girls and watch the big game, this is it. If you want a casual place to drink some beer with pals, skip it."}
{"text":"Fox Sports Grill a year ago would have gotten 4-5 stars.    The service was terrific, the food was above-par for a typical bar, the prices were fairly reasonable although a tad bit upscale and there was a vast amount of seating that would allow you to watch virtually any game in comfort.  Now other than the seating, pretty much everything else has changed.   The last two times I've been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.       Now the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.    What they've managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu, drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices.  Now you're stuck with overpriced, dry and unappetizing sliders, food that tastes of dirty oil and more.       Their pizzas in the past were fantastic, the crap they're serving up nowadays reminds me more of generic frozen-food aisle grocery store pizza(not even Digiorno).     So the food tastes awful, but they've had the audacity to raises the prices.  Now you're sitting there, paying way above-par prices for sub-par food.   WTF man?      This place used to be fantastic but evidently some genius decided that they could make more profit by offering crappier quality at higher prices.      I'm not buying it.      There's too much competition, too many other options for this sort of nonsense.             I can head to Zipps down the road, The Arena(yeah, its standard bar food but it won't cost an arm and leg) or best of all, Casey Jones Grill where I can pay less and somehow get much better food and service.   Bottomline, this place has jumped the shark completely.    Whatever they had going right for them is pretty much gone.     Its a shame, because this used to be a fave of mine but after what I've witnessed there, its not worth spending money or time at anymore."}

{"text":"So lets see, The NHL and the NBA are in the middle of playoffs, you also have the Diamondbacks on and all you can have is two barkeeps behind the counter? And to boot, you have a networking group of business people what HELLO..have clients, meet clients and want to pass on a good word. This was not a great experience at all, the appetizers were COLD, UNDERCOOKED and the service had a mouth when asked about it The broccoli was returned brought back, with a mound of cheese now and almost thrown at my friend for having nerve to return it in the first place. Suggestion: a) Hire friendlier staff, there was one guy who was nice to see what we needed b) hire a chef, they will toss the microwave, c) learn customer service. I really expected soooo much more from this place."}
{"text":"Here's the quick and dirty (keep in mind that I give some leeway when reviewing airport food versus normal food):  Pros: -quick service -great place if you want to catch a game -really impressed with free wifi at PHX -For folks who need to charge their computer during their downtime, there are outlets on some of the corner tables  Cons: -burger was mediocre and you'd expect them to have burgers nailed at least (choice was b/w medium well and well which should have been a sign). this may be the best PHX has to offer, but I doubt it.  Would recommend trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decent enough place to sit down and watch some TV while waiting for your flight at PHX; prices are high, but so are all sit-down places in airports.  Food was okay; staff was okay; other customers were loud jerks."}
{"text":"Not  bad, staff seemed friendly enough,  free wi-fi. I would've thought they were a concert bar from  the  price of my beer.  8 bucks!  Seriously had I known I would've ordered some Phoenix tap water.  Don't rely on your airline notifying you overhead to board your flight. When I paid my bill and turned towards the gate, 2 Southwest ticket folks were looking at me saying \"Julie?\"  It seems they resorted to wishful thinking rather than the PA system."}
{"text":"I love the Fox Sports Grill in Scottsdale.  It is one of my favorite places to do Happy Hour and watch the game when I am up North.  But of all the crappy restaurants at Westgate, this is possibly the worst.    We went a week or so after they opened and it was moderately busy.  Nothing crazy, but busy enough.  Went inside and told the hostess that we'd like to sit outside.  We were seated on the patio and saw a couple waiters roaming around the patio area so we figured that we were good to go.  10 minutes later, I went back inside and told the hostess that we hadn't received any service.  She apologized and told me she would let them know.  5 minutes later, after watching another waiter walk by us, I went back inside and grabbed him and told him we had been waiting.  He told us that we weren't his table and walked off.  We left after that.  We tried it again a few months after that.  We sat inside and figured we would have better luck.  While our waiter did actually show up this time, the food took forever and he brought out appetizers and meals at almost the same time.  The food is decent so it gets an extra star for that but with service this bad when the place is slow, I can't imagine what it is like when a football or hockey game is going on."}
{"text":"As the announcer comes across the PA system to jab a delayed flight notification spork into my neck I immediately stand up, don my backpack and drag my carry-on behind me like a ball and chain to soak my sorrows in suds.  A friendly old man greets me and I chuckle when he refers to me as sir.  I ordered the biggest Sam Adams and a chicken sandwich that would hopefully be low enough in calories so that I'd be able to indulge in a steak dinner tonight (if I ever make it to Dallas) and keep my caloric count under 3000 (thanks Sam Adams).  Surprisingly the chicken was tender, juicy and the bread was lovely (I happen to be a bread expert by the way).  Onions were perfectly sauteed and the basil offered a subtle unique flavor.  I'm going to try and replicate this at home.  Another beer please!  And YELP...1/2 STARS PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Service is just horrible, the taller big blond women walked by me three times and didn't take my order.  when i walked up to order she said to me you need to be seated! just rude"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes in the terminal section with no service.  There were other patrons that were waiting on checks etc.  I dont know why I stayed so long but it wont happen again."}
{"text":"Flight delayed. Drink time.  Well, if you're in this terminal, this is pretty much your only choice for bars so whether it's good or bad, you're going to be here.  We were here for a long time since our flight was delayed 3 hours.  You would think they would have a bigger place and bigger TVs.  Instead it's pretty tiny with older, smaller flat screen TVs.  Prices are expensive of course, it's an airport bar.  I reccomend the chicken strips and fries.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Ouch slow service and bad food what a combo."}
{"text":"Unless this restaurant figures out how to handle the post game crowds, some crazy fan, high on their own testoserone is going to go ape shit over the lengthy, hostess-quoted wait times.  They're going to get extra pissed off when they have to wait even longer to get service.  And unless they get the girl I got tonite, it's all downhill after the wait.  Their lack of a system for the celebratory masses (luckily the Cards won today), sets the waitstaff up for shitty tips.  My server had mercy on me and told me what to order if I wanted to eat right away.  That left me ordering the Filet Mignon Chili and caesar salad combo.  And my 2nd choice beer that I guessed they have, Sam Adams.  They didn't have my beloved Newcastle.   Now the chili was good, but the idea of having filet mignon meat is all marketing goodness.  Like I could taste the difference???  My filet mignon should be mooing in front of me after having been broiled to a medium rare perfection, not bobbing around in a bowl of tomatoes and other crap.  My friend ordered the Buffalo Nachos, which we found both strange and strangely good.  And evenly though it was a plate piled high with chips, the cheese and everything else seemed thrown together, like the chefs said, we can get away with this one cuz who actually makes neat nachos.  I dole out the 3 stars for our server who gave us her best \"this is the best I can do\".  I guess it was better than absolute crap."}
{"text":"I've been to Fox a few times.  A couple times at this location and once at another location.  The other location (in North Phoenix maybe?) blows this one away in terms of service, and well, pretty much everything else.  The food here is okay.  I tend to stick with the bacon cheeseburger here because it is usually pretty decent and it comes with their yummy fries.  They've never really messed up my food here, so that's a good thing.  I haven't had anything that was much of a standout here, but it is solid food.  The service on the other hand, is terrible.  The times I have been here, I have been completely ignored after being seated.  I have had to track down a server to get someone to at least take drink orders.  They are usually pretty unattentive too.  It could be worse I guess.  Just never go when there is a crowd, as the servers have no idea how to handle that volume of patrons.  This strikes me as so weird considering they are nearby two major sports venues as well as a movie theatre.    If you are hanging out at Westgate and get hungry at a non-peak eating hour, you should try Fox.  They have a fairly interesting menu and the food is usually pretty good.  Just don't expect stellar service."}
{"text":"Giving this one star is being nice. Absolutely dreadful food and some of the worst service I have ever experienced. At one point we had to get up and walk across the restaurant to get our watiress's attention just to refill our water glass. When we finally did get our food, it was bland and uninspired. Started with the wings, they were overcooked and too chewy. They only gave us one little cup of ranch for 8 wings and when we asked for more they said they had to charge us. I got the burger and it was ok but I have had much better at even fast food restaurants. My girlfriend got some salad that was dry, so to cover that up they drenched it in dressing. It was inedible, we sent it back. The best part about that is they still tried to charge us for it on the bill. We had to argue for about 20 min to get it off. First with the waitress, then the asst manager, and finally the general manager. Was charging us $11 for a salad we had two bites of really worth ruining a customer's experience? I guess to this establishment it is. The main reason we went was to watch a game and I was so turned off with them trying to nickel and dime us, I left in the third quarter and went to the zipp's up the street. Good setup with the tvs, but factoring in the below average food and the some of the most horrendous service I have ever experienced make Fox Sports Grill a place I wouldnt recommend to my own worst enemy."}
