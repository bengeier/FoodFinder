{"text":"I've been to the new Studio 82 a couple of times. The first time we got a bunch of apps. The wings were good (although the \"hot\" ones weren't that spicy), but the nachos were stale with not enough toppings, and the dip was too runny.

I went again today for dinner. I had the quesadilla and garden salad. The veggies were nice and fresh, but the quesadilla contained a weird cheese mixture. My friend had the burger, and wasn't impressed. The burger is advertised as AAA meat, so my friend expects a great burger, but instead described what he had as a \"spongy hockey puck\". The lettuce wasn't the greatest, but the cheese and pickle were good. Fries were good, but were little chunks.

But they have fruli on tap, which is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"We've been to Studio 82 three times now. The service was a bit rusty the first time but on this last visit I swear the server could read my mind. Love that! We come for the wing special on Wednesdays. They're plump and flavorful, some of the best in the city. Thursdays they have 2 for 1 appies. On sunny days they have a huge garage door they open up to the patio. Highly recommend. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"I visit Studio 82 frequently and always have a good time. It's a clean place, with friendly, attentive staff, good amount of seating and an ample dance floor. Most of the time I go to see the live bands that play on Friday and Saturday nights.

The last weekend of every month the band \"Glow\" plays; they are excellent musicians that cover recognizable, fun tunes spanning several decades (they also turn on the black lights, so that's cool). Also, on the Sundays of long weekends they have a band playing covers of 80's \"hair metal\" that is pretty good.

Service at the bar is excellent, even when it's busy. The few times I've sat at a table and the service was good too. The wings are very tasty, literally dozens of flavors to choose from. Wing nights are Wednesdays and Sundays, I believe they are 25 cents.

Cover is $5 on the weekends. There is ample free parking in their parking lot, and overflow parking available at the arena next door."}
{"text":"I am dumfounded that this place has gotten any positive reviews as the service, food and atmosphere all left a great deal to be desired.

First impression was horrible: used syringe in the parking lot. Totally unacceptable.

The layout and look of this place is just bizarre. I cut them some slack since the space is odd but they haven't done themselves any favours with either the chosen layout or the table style. It's difficult to describe but sparse and awkward seem to fit.

This would appear to be a great place to come to watch sports as they have a large selection of TVs, the problem is that they were all tuned to the same two channels. I am most certain that there are far more than two games on and a little variety would be great, especially for those of us who could skip watching the Blue Jays battle for last place.

When it came time to order food things got really weird. This is one of those places where the \"chef\" decides to put a twist on things. Every menu item takes a well known, some may say boring, item and does something downright bizarre with it. And not good bizarre either. Blending disparate styles like Southwest meets German or Mexican meets French is not a good idea and should be taken out behind the barn.

Our server was pleasant and prompt enough but wore so much perfume that I could barely taste my food over the stench. This may not have been a bad thing as my chicken chipotle sandwich was burned to a crisp and my yam fries were undercooked to the point of being crunchy. Cooking a chicken breast or making fries are both elementary things and if your kitchen staff can't get that right then you're in real trouble.  Needless to say I won't be back and encourage you all to give this one a miss."}
{"text":"Studio 82 is back after it's short-lived time as Rusty Cage South. I have to say that I didn't notice much difference (not a bad thing). They've done a couple of small renovations but the menu is similar and the staff is still decent and great scenery. My personal favorite is hitting up their 25 cent wing nights on Wednesday and Thursday."}
{"text":"I met a group for drinks recently and specifically came here to see the band playing.  Honestly, I didn't think this place was terrible.  I've been in some dive bars in my day and this doesn't come close.  One person at the table was complaining about the crowd and state of the bar.  It was clean, including the bathrooms, and we had an excellent server.  I will admit that I didn't eat any food, but I had a pint and danced a few times.  The crowd was not highfalutin and I'm totally fine with sharing a room with anyone who's out to have a good time, as long as they aren't pushing drugs, getting into fights or in my face.  

I never expect to eat decent food in a bar, so I rarely order.  If you prefer to hang with locals that wear suits and want see at least a handful of high maintenance men and women, don't come here.  If you want to cut loose and not be judged by most people in the bar, then you're good to go."}
{"text":"Good service and fun atmosphere to be in. Came here for a bachelorette party and had a blast. Food was great, drinks were great & so was the band (:"}
