{"text":"Twisted Lizard is great if you're looking for dinner, drinks, a great happy hour, friendly people and a great vibe.  I have never been disappointed with anything from this place.  

They have daily wine specials, a great happy hour and an awesome bar and patio.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to grab a drink or meal in north Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Love this little neighborhood place! Just tried the SW Levosh last night, WOW! I will be back again and again for this!"}
{"text":"My favorite dessert is mud pie and we picked this place for my birthday dinner because they have mud pie on their menu on their website. Lo and behold THEY DON'T HAVE MUD PIE! How frickin' hard is it to keep your website up to date. It's the 21st century. Not sure what else is fiction on their website but if you think you're getting it because it's on the website better call and verify."}
{"text":"Just a pop-in for a cocktail and really loved the vibe and feel.  Started with excellent service, were greeted promptly with a smile and received drinks and menus.  I had a well poured cocktail and my guest enjoyed a very cold beer.  

The happy hour menu was varied so you could enjoy price breaks on liquor and beer.  The food also looked excellent but as I mentioned, we had to run but I wish we had more time for food.  

Next time, as I highly recommend this North Scottsdale spot if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Our family loves the Twisted Lizard. Great patio with mountain views and they have a ton of TV's with all the games on. Very reasonable prices. The menu is good but limited. Staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I've been to the Lizard only once and while I agree the draft beer selection is thin, the prices are reasonable (unlike prior ownership) and my buddy & I both loved the Lavoosh."}
{"text":"Great service and best wings ever. Love to drop by for a drink and enjoying the relaxed atmosphere.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Location was close to home, so I stopped in.  The food can be good, \"if\" they remember to bring it out to you while it's still hot.  That's because the service is awful - with the exception of Brandon. He tries to stay on top of things and is very cordial.  The rest of the staff could use some training and organization. If you sit at a table by yourself, expect longer than normal wait times to get someone to stop by and check on you and that's when the place was not busy.  Cannot imagine what's its like when it's busy..."}
{"text":"We have lived right by this place for a couple years and haven't been because of the average rating on yelp. We have been missing out! We all loved our meals and enjoyed the sunset on the beautiful patio  the server was super sweet and the prices are reasonable. So excited to have such a great restaurant within walking distance. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is not very good my food is awful and sometimes not cooked my food is soggy sometimes it's only good for some things"}
{"text":"One star Is grossly exaggerating how good this is. Negative stars is the practical reality of this joint. We live in the neighborhood and so desperately want to like this place (and McDowell Mtn ranch golf grill- alas that place sucks arguably worse but don't get me started on that). Unfortunately the food stinks, the service stinks, and the the prices are hysterically high but for the fact that they genuinely expect you to pay them. I would take my chances at the chess club vs. going back here. Yuk."}
{"text":"Cool view.  Reasonably priced buckets of beer.  Sweet help.  The cook/chef has to be comatose.  Spinach artichoke dip is probably Crest toothpaste, sour cream, and onion, served less than lukewarm.  I only hope that Dow Chemical has an artichoke flavored chemical because there was nary a vegetable in whatever that was.  We ordered a Thai Chicken Flatbread.  It tasted like Spaghetti Oh's and was less than lukewarm.   Our advice to customers is to have a beer here and eat elsewhere.  Our advice to the manager is to taste what you serve and learn the Fahrenheit system is.  Try serving food above the ambient temperature.  You have a cool place with nice people."}
{"text":"Took my family there for dinner since it's the closest place for dinner when we are visiting family in the area. We had high hopes but were disappointed. The food was pretty good, not great, but not bad. It was the service that was challenging. The wait staff were very nice, but there just wasn't enough of them. If you requested a refill of your water, it would take literally 20 minutes to get it. Same with the check. I doubt we'll give it another try."}
{"text":"First of all the food is mediocre and the dishes they offer aren't very creative--and it's gone down hill within the past month..The real reason that I frequent this place is because of the musical line up on Thursday---Young Country--they are great!  I go there this past Thursday, and no Young Country..They cancelled them because of college basketball...Are you kidding?  No wonder why it was dead.  Mistake. Big mistake.  They need to get their act together or they will just go under like so many other places have.  Bring back the BOYS!"}
{"text":"This was our neighborhood place and we've always had good service, good food and good fun.  Not too loud. Big open patio.  Even a fireplace and live music on the weekends, so we invited our friends over from Phoenix.  How embarrassing!  Our waitress got us drinks and took our order and then disappeared.  No food was coming out and the waitress was AWOL so we couldn't even ask her.  No apologies or explanations were offered.  My shrimp came out burned on one side and so tough that I couldn't stab it with a fork, but I was so hungry I ate it like a lumberjack on lunch break.   They need to have enough staff to keep up the service we've come to expect.  I've never written a yelp but I felt like they just didn't care."}
{"text":"great time every time I come here food and staff are always awesome fun and great time adam is the bomb"}
{"text":"Great views of McDowell Mountains! Food good, service friendly.  Maybe it's just me but when waitresses ask if you want change back it's irritating.  Provide the change and you will get a bigger tip. When you ask for it it's a turn off."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Thursday night football. They were busy but open tables. Service was horrible. Took almost 30 minutes for our food. We finally asked the waitress and have to wonder if she forgot to put our order in! Food was just okay and over priced. I wish the place was better since it is a great location. Not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"Not good. Actually, bad. Cat food. Twisted Cat. Pass."}
{"text":"After several visits, I decided to update my review. 

It is such a shame that this great location can't attract an owner that cares at all about the business.  Apart from the view, this restaurant has nothing to offer unless you like substandard food and rude wait staff and bar tenders.  Like many in the area, I am waiting for this place to go out of business - it shouldn't be a very long wait."}
{"text":"First time my wife and I have visited this restaurant and I would give it a solid three stars.  The service was good although a bit slow, especially the food but thankfully it was fresh and delicious so we can excuse the longer wait. 

The patio is amazing and a very chill place to sit and stare at the McDowell mountains. The pricing was a tad high for what you received but again good food made it seem tolerable. 

We had the beer battered chicken fingers and quesadilla for appetizers and wow, very good. For the main course we had the southwest Mac and cheese. If there was one glaring thing wrong is that the Mac and cheese was not Mac and cheese. It was much more like a southwest pasta with some cheese in it. Don't get me wrong, it was great but certainly not what we had expected and for $13 would have loved a slice of garlic bread or something to go along with it. 

We will come back. Fantastic happy hour."}
{"text":"Well, I live down the street so I am a tad biased but as far as a neighborhood bar goes, not bad!!  Good atmosphere, good beer and wine, food is great for a bar.  Only thing I will say is its a bit overpriced.  And they need one more \"good\" beer on tap like Stone, Green Flash, Racer 5 or comparable.  Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with great food.  My favorite is the Tuscan salad which I get almost every time I go. They have a good variety of wines by the glass and a fabulous happy hour. Service is very solid too. And the views of the McDowell are excellent."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times and have always enjoyed the food. We greatly enjoyed there Brioche and the mushroom sandwich. We ordered as a pickup. They are quite good at how long it takes for pickup. Always close to correct. 

I would  suggest they add some chicken to the brioche though very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food. 
Great people. 
Great drinks.
Great tunes. 
I cannot tell you how many great nights I have had here with friends! 
There is a live band on Fridays at 7:30 rocking out to classics. 
The whole staff is fun and energetic! 
I enjoy hanging out on the patio and enjoying the purple mountains majesty during sunsets."}
{"text":"Great fried zucchini strips! Happy Hour with a view of the McDowell Mountains! Recommend sitting outside for the view if not too hot ; )."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  We love it!  Fantastic views, great local place, food is awesome now, Denise rocks, warmers and fire pit are more than welcome, and always a great time!  Would totally say to try it!"}
{"text":"The management is horrible!!  I've lived in MMR for 19 years and for the first time in that 19 years will not go back to Twisted Lizard until the management changes."}
{"text":"So long as Denise is not bartending, it's good.  She is a very rude, impersonable, horrible customer service bartender. She should not be in customer service ,,, never smiles, have to ask her for another drink because she doesn't ck on you, then when u ask her for another it's like you've pissed her off."}
{"text":"Was thrilled to see the old Caffe Portobello location reopen. If you're up around the McDowell Mountain area, you should make a point to swing by the Twisted Lizard. We've always loved the location and the staff at this location is sensational. Great patio, great bar, lots of patrons. The food is great, especially the pulled pork and smoked brisket (appetizer, sandwich or entree). All five of the lahvosh choices are fantastic, too. If you're really into draught beer, you might be disapponted, but there's a great wine list and plenty of bottled beer. Great place to go hang out with a few couples - especially if the guys want to keep one eye on a ball game. ;-)"}
{"text":"The website and menu do not indicate the true offerings.  We went there for dinner after checking out their menu on their website. The first two requests that we made were \"no longer available because the chef doesn't want to make those items any longer\"(from our server).  Completely understaffed, and slow service."}
{"text":"I've now visited this location on multiple occasions, each of them somewhat impromptu, and each of them very surprisingly pleasant. Twisted Lizard is quickly becoming the go-to spot for myself and my coworkers. It's central to where we all live and, more importantly, it never fails us, whether we're on the hunt for good food, good drink, or just a good place to enjoy good company.

During my first visit ever, I happened by complete stroke of luck to run into an old friend (Danika) playing an acoustic set. I had no idea that Twisted Lizard even hosted live music. Learning this was really exciting for me because I LOVE live music, and this location is walking distance from my home, making it an easy choice for a relaxing night out after a long day of work.

FOOD & DRINK

Months and months ago, a coworker raved to me about how good the food was at Twisted Lizard. After eating here for the first time not long ago, I have to admit that I was, yet again, surprised by just how delicious the food was! I remember ordering the Filet Sliders - thick cuts of delicious steak filets served with grilled onions and the cheese of your choice between a warm, fresh roll. Sooooooooo good!

The fries were also exceptional. I was visiting with two coworkers at the time and, after each of them \"tried one\", it was all I could do to keep their hands off my food! It was like swatting at flies (but who could blame them, right?).

The drink options are also very acceptable. My usual go-to is scotch and, while I've seen larger drink menus elsewhere, I've never yet been disappointed with the range of options available to me here.

SERVICE

Every time I've ever been to this Twisted Lizard, I have been fortunate to experience wonderful service. I've had the same bartender a few times in a row, and she is always extremely pleasant to work with - very talkative without being intrusive - humorous, engaging, helpful. Honestly, I look forward to visiting Twisted Lizard because I've only ever been made to feel at home here. And that's no small thing.

CONCLUSION

If you've yet to visit this location and you're in the area with a hankering for some delicious American food or even just a quick drink (or 5), I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. You're sure to find something delicious to eat (or drink), and I'm confident you'll appreciate the wonderful atmosphere and attention to details of service, as have I.

Twisted Lizard Team - kudos to you. You work really hard at what you do and you deserve to know that it's noticed, and appreciated. Thank you for consistently helping me to feel welcomed and relaxed. Thank you, too, for the great live music, good drinks, and delicious food!  :)"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and would love to have a place nearby with good food and a great atmosphere. Sadly, this place does not fit the bill. The menu selection and quality of food is less than mediocre. Also, they have had a fireplace on the patio under construction for over 7 months! This is a job that would take a single person a day to finish! This lack of attention does not bode well for how the restaurant is being run."}
{"text":"I love their wings! They are grilled!  Great service.  The location is great with good views. Nice outdoor patio. Live music on certain nights of the week."}
{"text":"We love it here.  It is a great place for people watching.  Food is good.  I love the El Jardin lavosh.  I can't order anything else.  Spring for the big one, it is yummy as left overs too (just a bit soggy)  The service is great and friendly and you really get a feel for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is finally the neighborhood restaurant it should have been a while ago. Stopped in and had some appetizers& a glass of wine. Food was good, wine was reasonable and staff was friendly! And to top it off the place was packed.   

Looking forward to having this in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went here to watch football.  I believe they are a Nebraska bar and they had the game on, but not a lot of people there.  The food was very good and the Bloody Mary was decent.  I love the comfortable atmosphere here with a great patio and a great view of the McDowell Mountains. Service was good."}
{"text":"The problem is $5 for a 12 ounce glass of domestic beer. Really? 5$ ?  The food is just so so, and also overpriced. 15$ for little baby sliders? Do these greed mongrels think they are in NYC?"}
{"text":"I literally live around the corner from this place. I was scared to go for a while because I might end up liking the place, and I could become \"a regular!\" So, one day my game wasn't on TV, so I ponied up and went over to check it out. First off, the place is clean, spacious, modern, with tons of TV's for sports. Too bad it's a Nebraska bar on Saturdays, being a USC fan myself! But, nonetheless, Stella on tap for 3 bucks... can't be beat! They do allow you to smoke on the back patio, if you're into that. Food seemed to be OK, and as my game was ending, families came in for supper, a good sign! Greg, the owner is a super friendly guy, who seems to be just hanging out all the time! No 5 stars only because I wish they had a little bit better of a beer selection, say dark, porter's, other ales on tap!"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING!!!  The cracker crust pizza was delicious.  In our group we all ordered very different entrees salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries very good.  Citrous chicken was perfectly marinated great flavor.  I had the whiskey flat iron steak with blue cheese and bacon butter was melt in your mouth with perfect flavors.  Outdoor patio and live music added to the ambiance very enjoyable relaxing and amazingly delicious experience.  A must try."}
{"text":"We've only made one visit to the Twisted Lizard and our experience was a good one.  A friend mentioned it as being a good place to watch Nebraska football games so we decided to try it out.

For what we were looking for, it was perfect.  Laid back atmosphere, plenty of TVs, good food and good service. 

We had some kind of a garden (veggie) lahvosh and the BBQ sliders (pork, beef and chicken combo).  Both were good."}
{"text":"Denise is what makes this neighborhood restaurant/bar feel friendly and special. She is incredibly attentive to every customer and always remembers your name (like Cheers!).   It's a great place to touch base with your neighbors and friends in between sports practices for the kids.  And the view of the mountains!!?? Fabulous! There are always friendly faces, healthy meals and nice live music at Twisted."}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked away in the McDowell mountain. The food was really tasty and the service was on point.  We felt very welcomed and enjoyed our visit! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! I used to come here when it was the old place but over the past couple of years it got pretty bad BUT NOW new owner new name and it is awesome again. Good food good people good value GOOD TIMES"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place on a Thursday evening for the live music and solid food."}
{"text":"I wish this place would have left a yummy taste in my mouth but too bad this place didn't! Great location close to home, service was rather slow and the taste of the food lacked flavor. The flatbread pizza things tasted like stale crackers with watered down tomato paste and veggies drained from hot water. I use to bartend and the drinks she made were so off! I'm so sad to leave a bad review and so sad this couldn't be my new hang out... It's so close to home :( I won't be back, I tried a second time and there was no improvement. It's literally busy because of all the drunk perbs hitting on every chick at this joint lol. Definitely a meat market"}
{"text":"Went on a weekend and the band was great. The food, however, was not so good. Had the chicken quesadilla and buffalo chicken lavosh- both were so salty we couldn't eat them. Waitress was just so-so, she kept her appearance at our table so short that we had to get up and ask her for things instead of being asked.   Restaurant temperature was also a bit warm and place didn't look very clean-windows were streaked and dirty. Looks like an ok neighborhood hangout but not a place we'll go back to."}
{"text":"Vacationing in Phoenix and stopped in due to proximity to our rented condo.  Overall, very average.  Wait staff was pleasant, but everything else was generic.  Many other places in the area were much better."}
{"text":"Server was still giving drinks to very inebriated bunch of people sitting next to us.   No DD anywhere either.  Kinda scary"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the views!!  They make up for the food completely. The patio is super cozy with a wonderful fireplace. 

We had just about everything from general bar food to the steak. Again, all together ok but an outstanding patio."}
{"text":"Has anyone actually added up your check? Happy hour for the house..do the math next time you get your check- if you can. Wrong prices..attitude and a draft beer poured with half head. Not the first bad experience,  but will be the last. I wonder why their entire kitchen staff walked out. Now that math I can do..."}
{"text":"Really, really weak beer selection. Inexcusably so.  
It's like they signed up for the 3 taps the Budweiser salesman was pushing and that's it. 
 

Sad. 
And lazy.   


I really wish I could like this place but other than being really close to my house, I can't.

There is so much they could do to improve it's appeal but they seem to want to pinch pennies to save a dime rather than seeing the big picture to make dollars.


Follow up: 
Read through the other reviews.  Notice how many people say they wish they could like it better, how they want it to succeed, that it seems lost and without any identity?  

Owners: Your potential customers are cheering for you, get with it before it's too late."}
{"text":"I SO want to like this place.  It's the only place within waking distance to our house in MMR.  Loved it over the summer, but since the new owners took over, the service and food have gone down hill.  Pulled pork and brisket used to be favs...not as good anymore.  Lizard greens are good but not sure if they have a new cook but he/ she over does it...way too much pepper on the linguini squash.  They changed the menu and when I first tried the Lizard wedge, it was great with lots of yummy fixings, the second time, it was just the wedge of lettuce with very little fixings.  I mentioned it to the server and she acknowledged it and said, 'yeah it was better when they were trying to promote it as a new item.  Also they need better and more beers on tap and the wine pours are not generous at all.   Also, sad Sclafini's pizza had to close as a result of new owner. It was very, very good."}
{"text":"One star is too generous for this \"establishment\". When you order food and drinks you expect it to be served in a timely manner. Every time we go here to give it another chance we are always disappointed. Why do we bother. You should not either. The food is nothing special and lacks flavor. But
That's what you get when the owner does not care about service and their customers. We want this place to work because it's the ONLY place in the hood. Of course that means there are opportunities to be had!"}
{"text":"We've popped by for happy hour a few times. Great prices. Love the wings! Great atmosphere, especially when it's patio weather."}
{"text":"We were very excited when we saw this establishment had new ownership.  The location is fantastic and the restaurant is clean; however, we will not be back for several reasons.  First, they need to seriously work on the menu.  It is not very expansive and I have not been excited about any items I ordered (out of three visits).  In addition, I was hoping the draught beer selection would be better.  Due to food and beer selection, I will be spending my money up the street at Temple Bar."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a half dozen times. The Twisted Lizard has an outstanding patio. Their ribs when on special are good and decently price. Their baked beans and fries are great. Their chicken finger dinner is really good, albiet very pricey ($14 if memory serves me). Unfortunately their burgers have no flavor. For a bar, you have to have a decent burger, I can't even twist my wife's arm anymore for her to join me. Bad service and bad burgers cancels out outstanding patio views.

Took about 1/2 hour to get our burgers on St. Pat's day. This was after the happy hour rush, the place was about 80% full. The waiter never came by to refill my beer. My bad, he asked me if I wanted another beer after about 15 minutes after I had finished my dinner; Check Please!  I noticed the tables next to us were having full attention from their servers. So the bad service doesn't seem to be a restaurant wide problem, but that was my experience on St. Patrick's day."}
{"text":"Good location,it's within walking distance from my house. Decent atmosphere and food is good to ok but with so many choices I don't find myself here very often. The food could be improved upon and the place seems to lack character or that special something"}
{"text":"Great new place in a familiar location. Menu is much improved from Portobello, staff is very friendly, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Have come here often since we live so close. Doesn't disappoint. Happy  hour is great & on a recent visit my large party had the good fortune of getting Sophia as our server on the patio. She was really awesome! Excellent server & one they should hold on to. I know TW offers live music too but I've not been there during those times. 
Really great patio!!"}
{"text":"I have just had one of the best Pork Tenderloins in my life. Exquisite!!. Lizard Rocks"}
{"text":"Food, friends and fun!  We are so grateful this place is in our neighborhood.  If you're thinking neighborhood  bar you will be pleasantly surprised.  The vibe is comfortable  and the food is always delicious.  Tuesday night half price bottled wine makes it our date night regular spot.  And sports viewing is a must whether Sunday morning or Saturday night. 
Just tried the new seasonal menu.  It's innovative, delicious and well-priced.  But then so is everything on the regular menu too.  The staff quickly become your friends, not just your wait staff.  Adam manages with a hands-on personal touch, and welcomes suggestions for new menu items.
Mikey, Jessica, Sophia and little Alex - yes, you get to know them all - will make you feel like you're part of the family.  I can't say enough about this place except just go there.  You will love it too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The view through the bar of the mountains can't be beat.  Open Sundays for football all day.  And the happy hour is an awesome deal.  The wings kick ass!"}
{"text":"I could forgive all of this place's little shortcomings if it wasn't so ridiculously overpriced.  I guess you're really paying for the incredible view.    

The food ranges from bland to mediocre to fine.  Nothing is outstanding and most is very food service grade.  The tap selection is a joke with nothing interesting at all.  Drink prices are laughable.  Service is usually pretty good but it has been frustratingly slow at times.

On the plus side, the live music is nice, the patio is great and the interior is comfortable.  I wish we had a neighborhood spot where we could grab a couple drinks after work, have some great food and not leave $80-100 poorer.  Unfortunately, that is not this place."}
{"text":"Cafe Portobello is now the Twisted Lizard.  I stopped in to catch a little of the MNF game.  Of course, I ran into a few folks from the neighborhood.

They ditched the Italian theme and have a new contemporary menu.  The sandwiches, entrees and lahvosh look good.

I just kicked back at the bar and had a Dos Equis Amber and watched the game on one of the many flat screen TVs.  At $3, the cold beer tasted really good.

I hope the new owners can bring this great neighborhood place up to it's true potential."}
{"text":"A few of my girlfriends and I decided to go here after an afternoon spent by the pool. We were looking forward to going someplace different and with a chill atmosphere.   

No one greeted us for the first few minutes we walked in. Keep in mind, it wasn't busy at all. There were maybe 4 or 5 tables in there. Not only did no one greet us when we sat down, 4-5 staff members stood a few feet away from us and argued about who had to take us. It definitely didn't make us feel welcome.  

At that point we almost left  but the menu looked good so we decided to stay. Turns out, we should have left.  My friend ordered a buffalo chicken lavash (sp) her food came out and it was cold- like it had been sitting there for a long time -gross! When she mentioned it to the waitress, they didn't even offer to make her a new one. They just heated it up and through it back down in front of her. My burger was under cooked, and my friend who had the French Dip said that her sandwich tasted like shoe leather.  Overall, not a good experience. 

As we were standing outside waiting for our uber, my friend asked another couple that happened to be leaving at the same time how their food was.  The woman said they order some sort of meat and it too was like eating shoe leather  

I had been here once before a few years ago and remember having a wonderful experience.  It's has definitely gone down hill  

Overall, you're better off going somewhere else"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good outside space, but that was all it was, good.  everything was good there was just something missing to make it truely 5 stars."}
{"text":"The once great neighborhood hangout has now fallen into the trap of bad service and bad management. I don't completely blame the servers because having worked in the restaurant industry I understand you need a great management and kitchen backing up your servers to succeed.  
Having said that I have had some wonderful experiences in the past, but since management and a kitchen staff overhaul it's sad to say that this place is just awful now. It looks dirty and unkempt, the booth seats fall out of the booth and a good majority of the chairs and tables are wobbly.  When I went to the twisted lizard establishment last, I was not expecting a great experience having read the reviews in the past couple of months. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and showed to our table, it was pretty dead but it was a week day night so I wasn't entirely surprised about that, lots of folks in the neighborhood go out of time around this time of year anyways. I got the fish tacos, thinking it would be a safe bet. They came with tons of cabbage but about half a pinky sized piece of fish in both tacos. I was not impressed, it was served with cold Spanish rice that tasted like something out of the box and very soupy black beans that were almost spilling over the plate edge. Our server was friendly enough, nothing to complain about other than the food took so long for it being so empty! If it was a busy Friday night sure, but it took almost 30 minutes for fish tacos and a salad with chicken! I noticed that people sitting by us got their food, took their first bite and looked absolutely disgusted. They got some type of steak, it looked decent but I heard them saying it was chewy and undercooked and the worst thing they've ever had! So safe to say you probably don't want to try the steak. The prices are a little up there when you compare them to the quality of the food. Overall the lizard is a disappointment, you're better off eating elsewhere. Just drinks and hanging out watching a game is another story but the location calls out for some decent food!"}
{"text":"Wow..... what happened to my once favorite watering spot.    The location is always fabulous- can't mess that up.  But the food--- ouch!  We asked if we could customize the lahvosh-  met with an immediate NO.  all I wanted was havarti and bacon.  People-   It's basically melted cheese on a large cracker.  After a moment- they finally agreed I could do that -  not sure what direction they thought I was going with the initial question.  Sadly. Our melted cheese was not melted but still shredded in appearance once it arrived at our table We ordered fish tacos.  They came served in flour tortilla with a ton of cabbage and barely any fish.    The size looked impressive- but on inspection of the inside- it was disappointing.   Barely any fish at all. Next a wedge salad-- how do you mess up wedge salad?  Serve an entire head of letter cut in half with toppings in glob in top. .  Again- for a moment you think- nice size!  But after we all sat and pondered- our food really seemed more of an after thought and that someone was attempting presentation with not a lot of experience.   The place was pretty empty for a Saturday night- that should have been the first clue.  Sad experience."}
{"text":"What a great place! We have lived here for several years and Twisted Lizard is one of the best sports bars in the neighborhood! We sat at the bar and the service was impeccable. The food was very tasty and served with plenty of garnishment and condiments. The band was setting up and everybody seemed excited to hear them. It was great ambiance and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Since new management came it's been downhill. It's fine if you only plan to drink but the quality of the food has gone way way down and they turnover staff now. It seems like there is always new people there working. The pizza lavosh we ordered had canned chicken which was so gross and another was supposed to be andouille sausage that was supposed to be on another lavosh tasted just like a hotdog.  Another time barley cooked chicken fingers and over cooked fish and chips. We love supporting a community business, but this place even after feedback doesn't seem to make any changes so now we forgo going there a lot. Very very sad to lose a place just down the street."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird vibe here, but the food is good. Only a couple beers on tap, which I wasn't too pleased about, but they had bottles and cans, plus a full bar. Been here a couple times. Will likely be back, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"I guess I'm a bit biased to this place since it's my neighborhood haunt, but I love coming here especially for happy hour and a great atmosphere. I think Twisted Lizard has pretty much the best wings around, and even better they're only $6 during happy hour which is pretty amazing to begin with. They refer to them as \"Charbuff\" because they're cooked just like a any other wing, but then grilled afterward to give a perfectly tender yet crispy texture - definitely making me hungry as I'm typing right now. If you happen to make it past happy hour, they also have live music certain nights of the week also."}
{"text":"Just Celebrated my Sister's Birthday here, about our fifth time here, we love this place, Great Food, Great Service, and they were all so Great, and accommodating for our Family get together, Jessie, was the Best !  Thanks Jessie !"}
{"text":"Poor customer service and overpriced food that arrived cold. Wonder how long this place will last..."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, family friendly, local hangout and perfect to watch games.

The staffs were friendly and the food were good. The only negative things about this place  is that the portion of food is way to large. The salmon& rugula salad was lack of flavor, but the strawberry salad was delicious!

I wish the live music would play in the front next to the entrance to bring the more vibe."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this is one of the best neighborhood bars I have ever been to. I will admit, I didn't have high expectations for a neighborhood bar - most of them are dingy with subpar food. Not this place. I can honestly say that everything I have had from their regular menu is fantastic and stuff I would (and do) order again and again.

Let's talk Happy Hour - it runs Monday through Saturday from 3-6:30pm. Most appetizers are at least half off and well drinks are $4. My husband and I love their quesadilla and their chicken wings. We order these frequently and they are delicious every time. We've tried their hummus and flatbread, but something about the quesadilla really hits the spot. They have Happy Hour on Sundays as well but its drinks only and it's all day. (If it is Football Season, then they have slightly different Happy Hour specials as well.)  

For dinner, you cannot go wrong with the flat iron steak. It just melts in your mouth and you get two sides. Normally I'll get a side salad and an order of the beer battered fries, but their sweet potato fries and zucchini sticks are amazing as well. They do have a seasonal menu in which menu items change frequently. From this, I've tried the sea bass and let me tell you - this was the most tender and juicy sea bass I've had. There was a lot of butter involved but who cares - it was amazing. 

For lunch, the sandwich list is extensive and I've tried almost all of them. I love their turkey bacon sandwich - the turkey is thick cut and extremely juicy and tender. (It is way better than any other turkey sandwich I've had before and I've eaten a lot.) Then there is the chicken bacon poblano sandwich - oh my. This chicken is extremely juicy and melts your mouth. Plus the poblano makes it spicy! If you aren't in the mood for poultry, try their filet sliders. Three sliders with filet cooked to order. Another delicious option is the burger. My husband has ordered this several times and loves it. (Yes, you can add bacon and you probably will want to. Their bacon is cooked to crispy perfection.) 

Did I mention they do brunch on Saturdays and Sundays? Well, they do. They have flatbread breakfast items, burritos, and regular breakfast fare. They even have coffee - which is pretty good. Then, on Thursday and Friday evenings, there is live music from local musicians. Music starts around 8pm and it's a great way to unwind after a long day. 

Twisted Lizard is a great place to come with friends, family, on a date, or even solo. The servers are friendly and will remember you, which is nice. Additionally, the service is fast and you will get your food in a timely manner. 

Overall, you cannot go wrong with Twisted Lizard. They have something for everyone and a good time will be had. I will definitely be back, so stop on by! You'll probably see me there."}
{"text":"Very sub-par beer selection and the food is OK at best.  Been there a couple times and wanted to like it because it is close to home but overall it is pretty blah."}
{"text":"Local watering hole for the neighborhood. Food was ok, rather bland in my personal opinion. The restaurant itself was rather drabby. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great to have a neighborhood pub where you feel like family - like Cheers. Management always working to get better."}
{"text":"Horrible service 3 times in a row. North Scottsdale prices $$$ without the hospitality. From the booth or high top, I always have to go to the bartender to order drinks. Takes about 5-10 minutes before a serves comes to the table for the first time."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I have walked to The Lizard at all hours. The food is INCREDIBLE! The service is pretty good too. They are busy and the staff does a pretty good job for as many people as they get in. Be patient if you have to wait to be seated. The Lavosch (sp?) is amazing. Great salads and wings. Great beer selection, fun place to watch the game. The owner seems like a cool guy and is really friendly and accessible. This may be the perfect neighborhood bar.  I almost forgot, burgers are really incredible too! Keep it up TL!"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and the food is good. Just a nice neighborhood bar with friendly people."}
{"text":"The negative reviews after the change of management/ownership caused me some concern, but we went anyway.
Four of us for dinner had a pleasant time. Greeted well.  Took a table inside since it was beastly hot outside.
Menu is what you would expect, the wait staff was good without being overbearing (I hate that), and the food was above average.
We had a booth, but the bar area looked inviting.
Typical venue in strip mall area...
I would go back."}
{"text":"I used to go here with my family at least every week as my favorite easy neighborhood bar, with good food and nice people. Now a days, the food is way too pricey, the portions are smaller and sometimes the food is cold, gooey and undercooked. Also, whatever cleaner they are using, I cannot tolerate as it's way too strong and smells like Porto potties to me! With the prices they are charging and the low quality food, I am very sad to say I don't think they will last much longer. After all, attendance in the peak hours has severly declined so maybe people are catching on. Please, get new management and bring back the good food! I miss my neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"Place is okay. Music on Friday's ( and I think Saturday's) is cool. I've ordered the Veggie lavosh a few times and has been good. There is one with sausage that wasnt that great, it tasted like a hot dog not sausage. I haven't tried anything else but the beer and lavosh but I will try something different in future."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the improvement over previous establishment. Excellent food - best grilled salmon I've ever had in the USA. Great wine selection - will be making a return visit soon"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for Happy Hour. Great patio with areas for both sun or shade. Service was fast! Great selection of $3 beers and $4 well drinks. Had the wings with barbecue sauce (I don't do hot but that was an option). Wings were fried, tossed in sauce and delivered hot out of the fryer. Very good. Also shared the veggie and fruit platter. It was a generous helping and every thing was fresh and crisp. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great location in a nice area of Scottsdale. Great music and environment. The only issue unfortunately is the bar keep who has a terrible attitude. One of my closet friends invited us there for the first time and asked a simple request...a Keoke coffee, Kahua, Brandy, Coffee and whip cream which he enjoys with a cigarette on the patio. A reasonable request when your paying $10.00 per drink and you will order 3 or 4 of them. It took a call to the manager and it still took 2 or 3 hours. The place would truly be excellent if it wasn't for this one thing."}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood hang! The staff and the food is awesome. We play here as much as we can when we're in town.

{"text":"Looks to have a lot of potential. I enjoyed a drink here with a buddy a few nights after they opened. It was pretty empty for a Friday night, though that should change as more people discover this hip neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"What a fun neighborhood bar. I absolutely love this place. I sat out on the patio with a fantastic mountain  view. The food was really good and the wait service amazing. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Went to this bar with my husband we live in the area and thought we would try somewhere new. We looked at the Yelp reviews and there were multiple bad reviews and figured we would give it a try ourselves. We walked in and sat down on the patio and it took awhile for us to get service. Finally we got service and ordered a couple beers and calamari. When we got the beers they tasted  funny and we couldn't figure out what was wrong with them. My husband is a avid beer drinker and said right away the beers were watered down and flat and they were. When we got the calamari it was just flour breading there was no calamari inside of the breading and the marinara was also watered down. It was disgusting and not edible. We didn't complain just asked for
Our check and went somewhere else. We said we would not go back there again, it was a little disappointing because this bar has potential if it changes the way it does business and changes its menu. The views are amazing from the patio that is the only thing positive about this place."}
{"text":"Twisted Lizard is very close to my house, and I wish it was \"super\" good so I'd want to go to it more. It is decent and I've liked the food the two times I have been, but nothing memorable, nothing that I crave. When it cools down I'll definitely try again."}
{"text":"We found the twisted lizard on yelp and went there because of the good reviews. It was after 8 o'clock on Easter and we're really glad this place was open. The food was very good. I had fish and chips which were cooked to perfection and I also had the wedge salad which is like 4 pounds of lettuce and toppings. I would recommend getting the dressing on the side in case you want to control how much dressing
The night we were in, there happened to be a rattlesnake in the restaurant. As a credit to this restaurant staff, we didn't learn about it until after it had been disposed of by the fire department. I would've loved to seen it but again a credit to the restaurant is that they didn't panic and handled it professionally. The one downside is that our waitress, while attentive and charming, was clueless about the menu. She had to check on everythingWe asked and truthfully didn't know much at all. I'm hoping she was new but who knows. Definitely worth checking out, great beer selection great food great service if you know what you want"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and live entertainment. I usually sit on the patio near the fireplace. So far I've only had appetizers but the rest of the menu looks good. Service is always friendly. I've heard it's a Nebraska bar too."}
{"text":"Huge patio, good food and amazing views from the patio.  Also lots of TVs. I'd like to come back when they have live music."}
{"text":"The place is ok. Food is a bit spendy for what ya get. Lots of older north scottsdale peeps doing a lot of hugging and back slapping feeling pressured to get out of here not sure why the place is not packed. I got news for them I ain't leavin till my wine is killed!!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the service is awful. The staff consistently chat with each other or a buddy who is a customer while your food is waiting to be served or your drink refilled.  I have gone back three times hoping it will get better. They definitely need a  manager to direct the wait staff!"}
{"text":"I was actually on the fence about this place but have since decided that I like it. A lot. The servers are super freindly, the view is amazing and the food and drinks great. Walking to this place and having a bloody Mary on Football Sunday is a treat or just chilling out with a very cold Pinot Grigio and enjoying live music has been really-really nice this summer too."}
{"text":"Well other than charging you a dollar fifty to have ice in your drink its A nice place to go. I don't think they charge for ice and soda though so I would recommend going there for lunch and having ice tea, beer or soda. Mixed drinks require an extra dollar fifty on top of the charge for the drink. I was very surprised to see the charges on our receipt for a  \"ROCKS\" $1.50 for each drink at the table."}
{"text":"This place has very good food for a sports bar.  Decent service.  Flatbread pizzas and salads were both good.  Good place to watch a game too."}
{"text":"A fun neighborhood joint for families & friends. Best thing on the menu? Beer battered French fries, hands down. Good homemade ranch dressing. Great views of the McDowell Mountains from the patio. I dig the live music on Thurs - Sat. The kitchen gets QUITE backed up on weekend nights - expect to wait a looooong time for your food. Great happy hour & other drink specials. Steer clear of the mashed potatoes - kind of gluey. The wings are pretty good. The food is decent - the ambiance/location is better."}
{"text":"First time here, it was nice we sat outside and the weather was perfect they had a jazz band that starts at 7:30 on Friday nights. Good times"}
{"text":"This is the perfect neighborhood tavern, friendly staff, good drinks and a good selection of quick bites, love the Lavosh! The view from the patio is stunning and the live music is a great touch well."}
{"text":"Quick stop on the way to Barrett-Jackson.  Good drinks and nice inside and out.  If I didn't live on the other side of the valley I'd go back more often."}
