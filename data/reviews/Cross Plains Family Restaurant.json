{"text":"My husband and I visited your  establishment in July and were impressed with the food (service was slow, it not terrible) so we recommended it to family and friends.  The next time we went the food wasn't as good and the service had not improved.  This evening we went for dinner and ordered the baked chicken dinner that was one of today's specials..  It took quite awhile to get our meal and we did not get baked chicken as we had ordered, but rather the broasted chicken.  When I mentioned this to the waitress she  said that there were 2 chicken dinners on the menu and that the cook just made the other dinner.  She did offer to get us something else, but since it has taken so long to get the wrong meal we opted to not go that route as we were on a time restraint.  There was no apology for the mistake or compensation on the bill.  The potatoes were room temperature and the chicken was so salty that we couldn't eat much of it.  I It will be quite awhile before we visit your eatery again.  What a disappointment. I would have given you a 1/4 star rating it it had been an option."}
{"text":"Cute little place, food was good and reasonably priced, and service was also good and friendly. Perfect stop on our way to the Great River Road."}
{"text":"Update:  Kate from CPFR messaged me on Thursday, apologizing and offering to make things right.  My teenage daughter and I decided to try going back tonight for dinner.  While Kate offered a free meal to make up for the bad experience last time, I didn't identify myself or accept the meal as I didn't want it to influence my review.  So...the service was much much better tonight.  It wasn't terribly busy but it still seemed more organized.  The staff were friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked in.  We were seated right away with menus and it wasn't long before we were giving our beverage and food orders.  We ordered a mushroom swiss burger and meat loaf.  The beverages arrived quickly and we were offered refills several times throughout the meal.  The salad arrived and was your average iceburg lettuce salad.  Then the meals arrived.  The meatloaf and mashed potatoes were adequately hot and covered with a brown gravy.  My daughter, who really likes salty foods, found it to be a bit too salty.  The mushroom swiss burger also arrived adequately hot.  The mushrooms were fresh, not canned.  The burger itself lacked flavor and I had to add salt to it.  The fries, unfortunately, were not hot, which was surprising for 5:30 p.m.  So, in summary, the service has gotten much better.  The food is average and could use some work to enhance the flavor."}
{"text":"I had the special, Frog Legs, and they were soo good, it was my first time trying frog legs but they were very good. All the wait staff were very friendly, and in such a small town like Cross Plains your bound to run into someone you know. One thing that could use some improvement is everyone there seemed very new to their jobs, the place did just open so i can't blame them, i'm sure that'll take care of it self soon. I'm definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This review is for the food only, ordered take-out. My fianc√© picked up and paid so I cannot speak to anything else. Had the cowboy skillet, feta and mushroom omelet with sides of pancakes. The skillet was large and the steak was pretty decent but I couldn't get over how slimy everything was. The hash browns didn't really stand out from the other vegetables, kind of soggy. All of it just tasted like vegetable oil. The omelet was pretty decent but the hash browns on the side were tasteless and not crispy enough. The side of pancakes were just ok. I'm not a huge pancake fan anyways but these just seemed chewy."}
{"text":"Excellent for breakfast! Love the Eggs Benedict and skillets. Homemade pies, also. Small family business and owners are friendly and accommodating. Hope they stick around for a long time!"}
