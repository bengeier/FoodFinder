{"text":"It was our 2nd visit in 24 hours !!! 

The samosas are that yummy! Normally its my wife who likes snack-type foods such as samosas, chaat, pani-puri etc... however this time it was me who was running to the counter is search of those super fresh, crispy, nicely spiced samosas!  We also had the Biryani from there and as expected... it was flavorful, aromatic and extremely delicious.  

Above it all, the customer service provided by the lady (Mrs. Hajra) was just superb.  I assume she is the owner.  Right from the start she greeted us with a warm smile and provided caring customer service.  This is our new hot-spot for spicy samosas!

Great job with the tasty food Gazeebo !!!!!!"}
{"text":"As I am Pakistani myself, I rarely frequent Pakistani restaurants when in the mood to eat out (why not eat the authentic stuff at home?). But that changes when it comes to Gazebo. The only thing better than the food is the service. Everything I've tried here, from the samosas to the entrees, has been tasty, authentic and leaves me wanting more. I would definitely recommend it to everyone as you'll not only get a great meal, you'll leave feeling like a member of the family!"}
{"text":"Place looks dirty. Their tandoori chicken tasted old. Their naan was processed and tasted grocery store bought. The cucumbers in my salad were wilted. Pretty gross experience overall."}
{"text":"Very nice staff - good food and very generous portions for take out. Had the shahi paneer ( you got to call in advance to order that as its off menu I think)  and it was good.  The treats they have are also top notch."}
{"text":"We went there anty gave us good response and when we were waiting for food she gave us free samosas sooo yummyyy .. Really wanted to appreciate her efforts , food and service .. Biryani and tandoori chicken was best .. Keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed and never returning again. The first time I went there the food was decently priced and delicious. This time it was horrendous. I got the veg pakoras, medium Malai Kofta, and small butter chicken. They gave me a medium butter chicken and small Malai Kofta instead. The butter chicken was oily and tasted gross. The balls of cheese and vegetables in the Malai Kofta were extremely hard. Also, the pakoras I ordered were the worst. The first time we ordered them they were decent. I would not call this order of potatoes and onions actual 'pakoras'. The potatoes were sliced thinly into circles and all the ingredients were in the bag but separated. It was gross, disappointing, not worth the money, and not worth the stomach pain."}
{"text":"Every time I go there, they are Super fast and friendly. I get  the Samosas usally 20 at a time, sometimes inconsistent in spices but overall very good.
The Butter Chicken dinner is real good as well, chunks of chicken breast."}
{"text":"****i have to amend my previous 4 star review:  like one of the below reviewers, I was also overcharged for my dish on my second visit. A whole $2 more than advertised. When I asked the employee about it, he said that they were in the process of changing prices and hadn't  updated the signs yet. I find that a little dishonest and not to mention, false advertising. I was not offered an apology and couldn't be bothered to argue, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. The butter chicken was pretty decent, however. I would order it again.  

Previous review:
Amazing service, great food. This place touts itself as a sweets place although I've only seen reviews for the entrees which seem to be fairly popular. 
The restaurant is family run and they really seem to care about their customers. They took the time to explain the dishes to me and asked if it was my first time. I decided on the biryani chicken which was quite tasty. The chicken was tender and the rice had the right amount of spice. It also weighed about 2lbs - bonus!   Samosas were tasty although I found the dough to be too much - too thick for a samosa. I will be back to try the butter chicken which seems to be popular. All in all, a great spot! I will return."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken combo. Butter chicken itself was pretty tasty, but not enough chicken and too oily. The naan was disappointing, definitely not freshly made. The samosas were very disappointing, overcooked, way too oily, and not very flavourful. Also, the price was made up, they took the posted price then added a random \"tax\" which came out to over 20%. Maybe I've been spoiled by the Indian food in Brampton, but this is a place I won't be returning to."}
{"text":"Takeout place only
-------------
I came here based on the two glowing reviews they had.  I ordered the butter chicken combo which came with rice, three samosas and a pop for $8.99. 

Value wise: 4/5 - that's a heck of a lot of food for $8.99. 
Quality:  3/5.  The butter chicken was different from your normal butter chicken as it wasn't oily.  Instead of getting cubes of chicken, they gave nice freshly cut chicken breast.  The butter chicken wasn't too spicy, but the chutney that came with it was delicious but WAY WAY TOO spicy for my tongue.  Overall the butter chicken was very good.  So why only 3/5?  While getting three samosas were great (they were veggie) and they were huge, they were cold and fairly bland.  Nothing wrong with them, just not the greatest.  

Verdict: I'd visit them again for a quick takeout while I work from home or have nothing to eat because they are like a 5 minute drive away from me."}
{"text":"This is probabaly the best possible Pakistani takeaway shop in gta. Their tandoori chicken was a hit in my party. Also murgh quorma was too good.  

Today I tried the dahi bhalay 3.5 dollars each and tasted so good and sweet just the way u get in Karachi. Papri chat 5 dollars was also Karachi style. Infact it was so authentic that I felt that I was eating on tariq Road. Jalebi was just ok."}
{"text":"Me and my husband are exploring fancy/non fancy eat out joints in TO and ended up visiting Gazebo!We came here thinking its a dine in but it's only a takeout and catering with a bar top with a couple of stools in the small yet clean store!

The lady behind the desk is the owner herself and the cook!We chit chatted with her she seemed very friendly and hardworking!

She offered us to try the pakoras for free which was very generous of her!We ordered a butter chicken combo which comes with 3 samosas and a pop.The Samosas were potatoes filled and one the best I have had in the North America region and the butter chicken was quite average.The naan was not home made rather store bought and grilled at the store- I wasn't impressed!
We also ordered Tandoori chicken which are sold by the piece each one was for two dollars. The chicken was juicy and very flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken.

As we were eating the lady/owner offered us some biryani to try and with that she offered us two small beef samosas both were a hit! We found her very generous and sweet!

Overall Verdit!
This place is a hidden gem for both potatoes and beef samosas and pakoras but on the other hand the food was average but I will have to give her a 4 star for her outstanding customer service she knows how to please customers.

While we were there we saw lots of people doing carry out and placing catering orders!
Will definitely go there again for samosas and pakoras!"}
{"text":"Went here as a second option to a usual place I get sweets from and I am so happy I found it! Really yummy sweets and samosas. My fav was the Delicious mango lassi!!!! Fresh and homemade"}
{"text":"Came later in the evening, not a huge fan of microwaved food. 
Woman at counter was super friendly, even a free samasoa. 
Would try again, place is very cold,. Might need a little heat inside."}
{"text":"Due to all the positive reviews, I've had this place bookmarked for a while because I thought, next time I'm in East Mississauga, I'll pop in and try the beef samosas.

I'll be honest, I was disappointed when I walked in.  Their website made it appear as if there would be many \"savory\" items to choose from; however, there was a very small menu above the cash with some items not even indicating the price.  I felt like the lady behind the counter was pushing me to make a decision.  Anyway, I ordered six beef samosas and asked about the butter chicken. Contrary to a couple of Yelp reviews, they DO NOT serve white meat; it's a mix of white and dark - I passed.  I asked about the tandoori chicken and I was told it's all dark meat, same with the chicken biryani ... I just decided to stick with the samosas.

I must have waited about 15 minutes for them and, when she brought them out, they were just thrown in a little brown bag, no sauce, nothing.  By that time, my husband had texted me to just buy the biryani so I asked her if I would have to wait a long time.  She indicated that the biryani was ready and went to the back and came back about five minutes later.  I asked about sauce for the samosas and she obviously pretended that she forgot and just gave me a big container of tamarind sauce.  The samosas came to around $5.50 (cash only) and the biryani was $6.50; albeit the sign said $6.00 - F*&K.

OK so here's the verdict on the food:

Beef samosas - probably some of the best I've even eaten.  Very spicy and, surprisingly, they did not skimp on the meat.  They reminded me of when I was growing up eating my mom's East African friend, Fatima's samosas.

Chicken biryani - COLD!  No kidding, it was served cold like it came out of the fridge.  WTF!  There were a couple of big pieces of some nasty chicken legs (which we discarded).  My husband heated it up and raved about how good it was and that it reminded him of Karachi Kitchen in Brampton.  I personally didn't want to eat it because I wondered about the freshness, given the fact it was COLD.  I did, however, tried it later on and it was shockingly delicious.  The only thing was that I wished it was a little less oily but still, nonetheless, very tasty.

Had the experience at the store been better such as not being charged more than advertised and the cold rice, I would have given it 5/5.  I do plan to return for samosas when it's my turn to bring treats to the office but I do plan to call her out on the cold biryani.  Like really ..."}
{"text":"Ordered their butter chicken combo ( comes with naan or rice and a drink), a mutter paneer, 4 pieces of tandoori chicken and an assorted sweets box all for $25 including tax. Their butter chicken is wonderful and their paneer is so fresh and tasty. Definitely the best paneer I've had from a restaurant! But the best dish I must say was their tandoori chicken, it was so moist and flavourful. I've never been a fan of tandoori chicken because most places tend to make it too dry or hard but this chicken was perfect and at only $1.50 for 2 pieces of chicken you can't go wrong! Got some Besan sweets which were made fresh and were absolutely delicious ($6 per ib). 

The best part, I must say, is the service here. It looks like a family owned store and the lady and her son working there are so pleasant and helpful. I asked if they had Shahi paneer which wasn't listed on the menu but she said she would make it fresh for me if I could wait 15 mins. They really go out of their way to help and I was very impressed with the portions, quality of food and service. Honestly cannot find anything wrong with this place.

I shall be returning soon to try their Biryani which is just $6 for a huge container!"}
{"text":"Just ordered here for the second time...and all I gotta say is WOW at their paneer. 
My my...."}
{"text":"Edit - best meat samosas in town...yes I said that!

When it comes to Pakistani/Indian food, i'm often pretty disappointed when eating out cause let's face it...not much can compare to mom's home cookin'.  That said, if you're craving some great Pakistani take-out...this spot does it right!

I first heard of this place at the halal food fest in Mississauga. I tried their vege pakoras and chicken samosas - on a first bite, my pupils dilated and I was transported back to a happy spot from my childhood.  The samosas were fresh out the fryer, overly stuffed with meat and made with the right amount of love and spice to make me want more...

Since then, I hunted down the actual restaurant in Mississauga and have not been disappointed.  While they offer a wide array of fresh sweets, appes and dinner items, my go to dishes are the chicken biryani, butter chicken, shahi paneer and a personal favorate - the chicken karhai.  The biryani is on par with any other good place, the butter chicken is arguably the best in the city and the karhai chicken is dare i say it...better than mom's!  For a guy that doesn't really do much veggies, the paneer dishes were right on point as well...

Recently I catered a tray of chicken biryani.  I was told a $75 tray would be good for 30 people (we made 3 other dishes at home).  As expected, the biryani was a big hit.  The big surprise to me was the serving size for this price - we had nearly half of this huge tray still left over.  

While Silver Spoon has good food at good prices, these folks stepped it up another notch and provide great food at even better prices.  Check em out..."}
{"text":"Oily cold butter chicken, and Stone cold tandooru chicken and samosas that I had to go home and 're fry and reheat. Might as well order frozen microwave food."}
{"text":"The samosas at Gazebo are perfectly airy, crispy and light, with well-balanced spice, and the dipping sauce is spot-on as well. The price is right, too, and most of all, the family members who greet you are lovely. On other occasions I've had their ladoos, which were as close as I've had them in India, if I may be so bold, ha. I'll be going back to happily make my way through the menu. I highly recommend this little takeaway gem, hidden away in a suburban strip mall not too far from Square One."}
