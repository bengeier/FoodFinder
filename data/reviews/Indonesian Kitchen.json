{"text":"Good Indonesian Food place inside the Calgary Sweet House. I had the rendang, rice and sambal bunci.  Also tried the chicken sate.  All tasted very good.  The sate is sweet and not spicy.  The buncis are pretty spicy. If it not spicy enough for you, just ask for sambal.  The owners are very friendly and know their stuff. I took of one star because of the dry taste in my mouth a few hours later. A possible sign of over msg use.

They have a good selection of dried spices and snacks to take home.  Authentic taste of Indonesia.  If you live in the North, go and try this one. If you live in the south, just go to Kaffir Lime."}
{"text":"Beef Rendang 
Tasty, yummy, tender beef cubes. The flavour is awesome, the sauce is thick and this goes so well with plain steamed rice. 

Special Fried Chicken 
It was fried to perfection. The meat was juicy and tender, while the outside was crispy. It's not the typical breaded fried chicken but rather fried chicken that has been marinated in aromatic spices. The chicken skin was marvellous. Tastes just like I am in Indonesia. Delicious! 

Sambal Tempeh 
Tempeh is something unique to Indonesian cuisine and they do this well. The tempeh was an acceptable texture to me and tastes great fried with the sambal. Next time I would ask for them to make it more spicy for me!

Bandrek ginger tea 
Nuff said. You must order this to end your meal with. 

Goreng pisang with ice cream 
Very ripe banana fried in a light and crisp batter. Ice cream was okay, the banana is the star.

Everything was good except that it's a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little restaurant with the most delicious food.
I wanted to try something a little different and Yelp steered me to this gem.
Our server took the time to explain the questions we had about the menu and made recommendations.
It's a small place, so good for a date or a group of 6 or under.
The menu items can be easily shared amongst a few people, which I suggest because there is too much to choose from.
Definitely try the Nasi Goreng and the Krupuk shrimp chips !"}
{"text":"So I ordered the Beef Rendang along with Coconut rice.

The service was super friendly, welcoming, and fast (points for that!)

The food portions however were a little small to my liking (maybe I need to order something else to really see the big sizes perhaps?).

That being said, the food was very delicious with the right amount of spice and flavor.

So, I would recommend you try this out if you're tired of the ol' Sushi, Pho, Indian, or European style foods :) definitely worth a go!!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from this restaurant. My husband and I absolutely loved our experience there. Starting from the host to the food and everything in between is wonderful. I love pretty spicy food and he is the opposite and yet we both came out just satisfied. 

Mohamad, the host (one of the owners) is a wonderful person. Professional, friendly and prompt are the words I have for this family business. 

Thank you for the delicious food and excellent service."}
{"text":"This unassuming restaurant on International Avenue serves up tasty authentic Indonesian food.  If you're not familiar with Indonesian cuisine, imagine Indian food with the spice dial turned down but more baking spices and a dash of Chinese/Thai influence such as green onion and lemongrass.  I'd give it 3.5 stars except Yelp doesn't allow that.  After trying a large cross section of dishes, three items stand out: the beef rendang with its fall apart delicious clove-scented meat cubes, the LA kalbi-esque beef short ribs with awesome caramelization and a hint of citrus, and the subtly perfumed sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf.  This restaurant is midrange in price... worth trying at least once, to see if this cuisine strikes your fancy."}
{"text":"Neat little place that serves great good. Chicken was fantastic. It can be very spicy...

The lady serving us was super friendly and efficient. However, she constantly tried to get us to purchase more food (an appetizer, a drink, another entree, a dessert, etc) which made it a bit awkward. 

I'd certainly recommend to anyone that likes a lot of flavor and spice!"}
{"text":"This small restaurant is unique and outstanding in its cuisine and flavours.  We started with some cassava fries followed by their appropriately named \"Best Soup in the World,\" a mild curry soup which had a wonderful aroma and taste, chicken pieces, egg, and glass noodles.  Then for main entries, we had Coconut Beef Rendang and Indonesian Curry Chicken, which had unique and tasty flavours. Portion sizes were enough to fill us up with no room for dessert.  Our server, a young Javanese man, was very attentive and friendly, always anticipating our needs and making us feel like we were special honored guests. Service was very fast.  This restaurant is right near the top of my list of best places to eat in Calgary and I will be spreading the word to all my friends and associates."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this place! Don't let the less than lovely exterior keep you from entering this wonderful restaurant. The inside is very cozy, the food is supremely prepared (and authentic, says my Indonesian friend), and the staff are very very friendly. I've been there twice within a month and look forward to many more visits. 

ps. The Sayur Asam (tamarind, vegetable and peanut soup) was my favourite. It is an unusual but delicious combination of flavours."}
{"text":"Got the skewers and the fried rice!  It tasted really authentic and flavourful! The waitress was really friendly and thoughtful!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it!! Food was fast to our table and yummy! I dont think i ever tried Indonesian food before, But had a great experience. The only complain would be that they forgot to give us the coconut rice, i really enjoyed the rice it was worth the wait. We will be back for sure!!  :)"}
{"text":"I got some takeout from there yesterday and was not pleased.  The portions were minuscule.  13$ for 5 cubes of beef?!?  C'mon.  Maybe the dine-in portions are more price appropriate, but I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Came to this lovely little strip mall restaurant while on my way to see a play at the ArtBox, the funky new performance and arts space on 17 ave SE. It was a \"lovely\" Calgary spring night (snow, -15) and stepping inside was like stepping into a beach-side restaurant in Indonesia. Rich curries, spicy coconut chili dishes, coconut rice - everything on the menu is delicious and rich - so don't be dismayed if the portions seem a little small - you'll be lucky to finish it! My favorite dish: the Soto-ayam coconut, curry soup ... Also loved the lemper ayam sticky rice appetizer, surprisingly delicate and subtle flavours ... Great dinner all 'round!"}
{"text":"Grabbed the take-out 5 item lunch box (fried noodles, tangy chopped salad, white rice, chicken curry and a veggie spring-roll) for $9.99. Good food, good value, good service. Definitely worth a return visit and more exploration of the menu. 

Staff (mother and son, I gather) were super friendly, told me about the range of other items on the menu, and loaded me up with an extra scoop of spicy sambal when I asked about it. 

Food was good. Fried noodles had lots of scallion and carrot, the salad was dressed in a sweet and vinegary dressing, and the chicken curry was coconut'ey though somewhat mild (hence the sambal). The food was not quite as revelatory as my first plate at Kaffir Lime at the Farmer's Market, but still totally solid. And, with great ambiance in the room and better hours, I'm sure I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become one of my favourites in Calgary. One of these \"tried and true\" restaurants. Food is really good and staff is very hospitable, almost like a 2nd home. 

And the meat is halal, which is great. 

Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"A tiny family restaurant with warm staff and great food. The ginger beef is delicious, as is the curry chicken. The atmosphere is warm and the decor is nice. Portion sizes are very reasonable for sharing, considering most restaurants overload you with food. The dishes were pleasing to look at, with rich colours and classy plates. The coconut rice came out in the shape of a cone, which was a pleasant surprise. The staff were a joy to chat with and we're very cheerful. 
Overall, the best Indonesian restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"Good food, but very small portions and high prices. 2 of us had to order 5 dishes dishes  to eat enough.  Won't go back. I didn't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for 30 minutes for a cup of soup. It's a Sunday, 2:39pm, there's a table with 8 people in it, and us. We understand they're busy, but how they can't accommodate another table with two people with a soup order as a starter is beyond me. Another couple arrived after us so who knows when they will get to eat. There are four other empty tables so you think they can handle it but they clearly cannot."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group. We ordered in advance (do this if you have a group). The plaza and restaurant look dinky, but the food was amazing. Exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Pretty authentic!
FYI, I'm from Indonesia."}
{"text":"Even through the outside looks dingy, the decor is very nice inside. They had many choices. I ordered curry chicken and my husband ordered Mir goreng. Both dishes were just okay. Definitely didn't blow me away. We were in Indonesia for 3 weeks so I do think I have something relatively close to compare the taste to. I also feel it was quite expensive for the portion size. But the service was good. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and a wide variety. The place is a bit small but clean, and service is very good, courteous  and polite people... Good family place to come to!!"}
{"text":"Family run restaurant on 17th ave. From outside it may not look attractive but they have good authentic Indonesian food. Very nice people works there and makes you feel like you have known them for a while. Its a small restaurant so harder for to arrange bigger groups.Nicely decorated with Indonesian pictures and wall arts on the wall. I have tried quiet bit of everything from their menu and they are all very delicious. RengDang beef amazing. Chicken and Shrimp wonton are really good. Fried Rice( Nasi Goreng) is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was very happy with both the food and the service.  A small place which was pretty quiet -  as I had never tried Indonesian before teh server did a good job explaining everything and recommending different dishes.  They have a good lunch menu with special which allows you to try a variety of items.  Will definitely be going back as there were several things on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"When I sat down for the first time at Indonesian Kitchen I was presented a fairly large menu with dozens of dishes featuring various meats and seafoods in a variety of sauces. Rather than trying to narrow down a selection of my own, I simply asked for recommendations.

First, we were advised that people normally order multiple dishes to share. Main dishes do not come with rice or sides so those need to be ordered separately. After taking some recommendations, we settled on the following:

- Sambal Goreng Ayam: chicken in a spicy chili sauce. We were warned this dish was spicy, but I found it quite approachable. The chicken breast chunks came in a spicy red sauce with onions and a few pickled veggies on the side. The sauce was nicely spiced if a bit greasy.

- A beef dish that I, unfortunately, cannot remember the name of. It was thin sliced beef short ribs in a sweet teriyak-type sauce with chilis. The sauce was sweet and the beef was tender.

- Fried rice with lamb. This rice was similar to standard Chinese fried rice, but topped with a whole fried egg. I enjoyed the lamb sprinkled throughout the dish , the portion of pickled vegetables on the side plus two shrimp crackers

- Seafood special fried noodles: this noodle side dish included generous amounts of calamari plus smaller portions of scallops and shrimp

I wanted to try the beef rendang after being told it was one of the more popular dishes, but the restaurant was out that day. 

The food was all flavourful, but I found the meat portions could have been bigger given the pricing.

Service was excellent, with both the waitress and chef coming out to ask how everything was."}
{"text":"I bit on the pricey side, but the food here tasted great and the portion was pretty good. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

For appetizers we had Lemper Ayam (sushi-like sticky rice with a little bit of chicken wrapped in banana leaf) and coconut curry Indonesian soup, Soto Ayam. The soup was really good, but sushi-like thing wasn't that impressive.

For main we had Sambal Goreng Ayam, it was hot and spicy, and therefore I really liked it. A bit milder second dish we ordered was Ayam Bakar Rica Rica, and everyone loved it. I think Nasi Kuning, the rice bowl we ordered, should come with the each dish instead of a separate order.

Overall I would say it's more like 3.5 stars than the 3 stars I gave it."}
{"text":"Work lunch, was going to go for Pho, but turned on Yelp (love the Monocle) and discovered this little gem. You don't find a lot of authentic Indonesian restaurants and this one is very good Indonesian fare. Nothing fancy but the decor is nice and the place is very clean. 

We were hungry so we ordered the Satay Ayam, Beef Rendang, Nasi Goreng, Coconut rice, and a side of the homemade Sambal. That was enough food for the two of us, with second helpings.

The young man at the front desk was very helpful and friendly, the owner came out to deliver a dish and chatted for a bit, very friendly and happy that we were enjoying the food.

Will definitely come back again soon, and even take home some of the authentic spices, condiments and delicacies they have for purchase."}
{"text":"Flavours are great but portions are a bit small. If they were bigger this could be 5star. Friendly service."}
{"text":"One could argue that Indonesian and Malaysian food are similar right? Well, for arguments sake, let's say so, because I'm comparing everything to the delicious Malaysian meal we had at Banana Leaf Tropical Cuisine. The bar is set high, can Indonesian Kitchen keep up?

The place itself is pretty small but doesn't feel crowded. At the front of the shop, there's a small but interesting display of Malaysian goodies - perfect spot to pick up some rare Malaysian spices, mixes and desserts that I haven't seen in Canada before. I'm guessing it comes straight from the motherland as everything is in Asian writing. There was only one waitress manning the tables when we were there for a late Saturday lunch but she was very patient and helped cater to my sis's demands, er, I mean, requests. The food takes awhile to arrive but you know the ladies in the kitchen are working there magic, so be patient grasshopper, and you will be rewarded.

We decided to share and over ordered (as per usual):
- Tea ($2 each) - nice, light and fragrant.
- Lemper ayam ($3) - steamed sticky rice with chicken wrapped in banana leaf. Perfect size to share, the lemper ayam had a subtle lemongrass flavour to it that was spot on. Yum.
- Singkong goreng ($4) - lightly spiced fried cassava. Cassava is a root vegetable, if you've never had it, give it a shot. These are almost like fries, just slightly heavier and more starchy.
- Sate kambing and sate udang ($14) - the waitress was awesome and let us try three lamb and three shrimp skewers (instead of six of the same kind).  We're all for trying out more things! The kambing (lamb) was really good - smothered in a spicy, peanut sauce while the udang (shrimp) was in a BBQ sauce with a hint of lime. The lime was refreshing and gave it the perfect amount to compliment the shrimp.
- Nasi goreng special ($11) - chicken and shrimp fried rice with Krupuk and egg (on the side for us). Those chips on the side of this dish reminded me of shrimp chips. The fried rice was flavourful, but it needed something else to give it that extra oomph.
- Gado gado ($10) - steamed veggies, tofu and boiled eggs topped with peanut sauce.  Lots of vegetables and so much egg (boiled egg, ugh, I'm just complaining because I was the one that had to eat it all). I don't think I would order this again as nothing stood out but it was one of the few vegetables dishes my sister could eat.

So final verdict? Indonesian Kitchen is good but it just didn't match the intense, umami flavour of the dishes we had at Banana Leaf. It's still worth trying out but if I had to choose just one, you already know my choice.  Overall, it's still a good spot for simple, freshly prepared Indonesian food!"}
{"text":"Really cool dive-y but ethnic place. That's the best I can do to describe it.
The decor is very unique. Colorful textiles, Indonesian artwork and dark wood panels with branch roofing that makes you feel like you are beach side....and makes you sad you aren't beach side. Even your food is served in wicker baskets, probably hand woven. Small table in the back is occupied by three women, patting and fluffing, rolling and pounding something delish.There's a wood rack of goods off to the side too.

We had zero idea what Indo food was about and zero idea what we were going to eat.
Our waiter (who is also the son, the food prep, the delivery and host) was super estatic and pumped that we wanted to try the best dishes. 
He came up with: Cassava (like fries), curry chicken, roti (awesome), Coconut beef (spicy) and coconut rice. 

Very good meal. Filled us up, good portions, and the sauces were super tasty. 
I asked for ketchup for the casava (which is very ignorant of me) and they went out of their way to find me some ketchup. 

We also found out if you pre-reserve, you can come in a big group and they do a family platter for a really decent price. Has basically most the menu and it's served in a really big weave basket. Will have to try next time!

They share a parking lot with Pizza 73 so watch where you park.


Review #12 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service staff, the owner is super sweet as well. Price is decent, quality of food is awesome! We ordered the chicken satay for starters and nasi goreng and rendang for our mains. It's definitely a place worth checking again!"}
{"text":"While admittedly it may be the only Indonesian restaurant in Calgary, it is also quite authentic (having actual indonesians... long story, but some past restos in Calgary had cooks from god knows where sometimes).  Having moved from their strange early locale in the depths of Forest Lawn, they moved to the main strip, renovated it, and made it a nice comfy, family place to enjoy the food.  I've been there twice, and while I wasn't too impressed by their fish dishes, their chicken, noodles and beef dishes were pretty bang on.  If you do go in a group of 8 or more, call ahead to talk about the menu.  I came in with 9 recently, and had a fantastic \"taste of Indonesia\" dinner for only $180 plus tax... and there was plenty of food to go around!  I can't say enough about the food, and speaking as a 1/2 indonesian myself, it's a place I will be seeing regularly."}
{"text":"Gosh!  Indonesian Kitchen, you've outdone yourself!  We loved your service and food prepared for us.  We had some difficulty finding the restaurant as we didn't know they had moved in a tiny strip mall next to Pizza 73!  Now, I know!  The restaurant is nicely decorated with the attap house of Indonesia with pictures of coconut & banana trees.  Lovely Indonesian masks are hung on the walls.  There is also a small grocery shop within the restaurant if you're searching for certain things like Kecap Manis (Sweet Black Sauce), Sambals, Krupuk, etc. 

We ordered the following dishes:
- Rendang (Coconut Beef) - so flavorful and rich!  Love your rendang!
- Gule Kambing - tender pieces of lamb in another rich sauce.
- Sambal Goreng Udang - Prawns cooked in sambal sauce; oh my, delicious!  
- Belado Terung - Eggplant cooked to perfection in a delicious spicy sauce with chopped tomatoes.
- Nasi Kuning (Yellow Coconut Rice) Steamed rice cooked in coconut and spices - so good with the spicy curries and comes in an upside down conical shape!
- Desserts: Kolak Singkong - Cassava cooked in a mellow, white, sweet coconut cream - not very sweet; just nice.  Served hot.  Reminds me of Bo Cha Cha minus the tapioca peals and yam & Kue Lapis - Layered cinnamon cake served with vanilla ice cream - most delicious Kueh Lapis, an Indonesian specialty cake.  Served slightly warms with ice cream.  What more could we ask!

Kartini, the chef, came out to meet with us.  She remembered us from before when we visited her restaurant about 5 years ago.  It's been a while.  We'll be back more often, Kartini,  We promise.

Most delicious!  Most flavorful!   

Sedap sekali, Kartini!  (Very delicious!)"}
{"text":"Amazing Indonesian food a true mom and pop restaurant that has fresh home cooked food. We tried the Rendang with noodles and was very impressed. Highly recommend coming here if you make it to Calgary."}
