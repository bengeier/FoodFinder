{"text":"First impression is excellent.  The place is new. Small little place that has Pho in Phoenix  right across from the Ray market. Went there for lunch. The menu has a fusion of dishes ranging from Vietnamese to Indonesian.  We ordered from the Indonesian section of the menu and the food was excellent. The guy who cooked our food actually took our order. Heis name is Mike ans he is from Indonesia and an authentic sweetheart. Great guy. After delivering our food he came to our table to check if we liked it. He seemed truly happy that we were enjoying his food. He then brought us a sample of the national dish and OMG. Freaking excellent!  We will definitely be back and i plan on trying most od thwir menu. I  would say this may be one of better asian places in the area. And prices are very reasonable. 2 people w drinks, 23 buck."}
{"text":"Awesome!!  Best Pho in the valley.  Broth perfect as well as veggies.   If you like pho give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Limelight Deals certificate for this restaurant, figuring it was worth a try.  So glad I did.  After a long day and not wanting to cook dinner, we decided to give it a shot.  This is in the old Pho Sure restaurant space, but it's definitely not the same restaurant.  The food was fresh, delicious and beautifully prepared.  Hubby had the Chicken Satay, which was very different from the usually cloyingly sweet peanut sauced dish we're used to.  I had the House Java Chicken Noodle (Mie Goreng), which I just finished for my lunch today.  It was the best of our 3 choices, but they were all very good.  My daughter had the Beef Teriyaki, which she declared surprisingly good (she has had teriyaki at many restaurants).  Her teriyaki came with an absolutely beautiful vegetable medley, which I also finished with my lunch today.  The vegetables were bright, fresh, and perfectly cooked, with a delicious sauce.  They definitely do quality, fresh food here.  Service was excellent as well, really lovely people.  The menu is small, but there are plenty of choices to satisfy most everyone.  Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.  We will definitely be back.  We took a take-out menu, so I can have hubby bring me home a fix when he takes his puppy to class nearby.  I want to try more of their menu items, to see if they are all this good."}
{"text":"This Place was great. I had Red Curry Chicken and my wife had Jalapeno Chicken. Both dishes were fantastic with all fresh and healthy ingredients. and the service was good and prices reasonable. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I tried the Pho and I do not recommend it. It tastes old, like it's reheated every day. It's very bland and just does not taste fresh at all. Unless they're willing to make it fresh and not reheat and reserve the same batch all week, they should really take it off the menu. If you want good Pho drive another 15 minutes up 99 to Happy Bowl in Ashland. I can't comment on the rest of the food because I haven't tried anything else, but if I do I'll update."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and each dish was excellent! Flavorful, exotic, ample delicious food! It's well worth stopping in Phoenix for if you crave some great \"Pan -Asian\" food."}
{"text":"Wow!  Tasty, fresh ingredients and excellent flavors, plus wonderul service.Was a little timid about trying this new restaurant because the previous one at this location was awful but, oh, sooo glad I did. They are expanding their menu next month. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place based on the existing reviews. We went for lunch and had the Kali Pepper Ribs, the Happy Family Chicken and the Mango Salad. The food was tasty with a lot of fresh ingredients. We both enjoyed our meals. The place is clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly. The restaurant is a bit difficult to find. It is in a small shopping mall that includes Jack in the Box, just north of Rays Food Place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times. I've eaten jalepeno chicken, and the phu, both were delish. Staff is super nice. Restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Four of us went here for the first time. The servings were ample and quite tasty. Three servings of chicken satay with peanut sauce and one tofu vegetable. Service and prices were good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The reason I tried this restaurant was because of the good reviews right off the bat here on yelp. I'm so glad I did! (And its 2 blocks from my home and I really didn't want to drive back into Medford after working all day!) The staff was super friendly and the food was prepared fast. Everything was piping hot, as it should be, and delivered with a smile. We had grilled salmon and red curry, spicy Yudon noodles with shrimp, chicken satay and or app was tempura shrimp. You get miso soup with the entrées. The miso had lots of seaweed and tofu and was yummy. The batter on the tempura was super light and not greasy at all.  The salmon was flaky and moist and the vegetables were crisp and fresh- quickly wokked and cooked perfectly.  Definitely worth a try fellow yelpers! New restaurants always make me Leary- but this one is worth the trip even if you don't live nearby! I'll be back again soon to try something different-"}
{"text":"Since this place was Pho Sur until just a few months ago, I thought I'd give it a try.  Basically, nothing has changed here.  The atmosphere, décor, layout of dining room, etc. is darn near identical.  I didn't expect the menu to be the same way, but it was.  Expecting more of a change, I guess.  However, there were tiny changes on the menu to give it a little more variety, but barely enough to notice.  I chose to go all out and order their top specialty item; the \"Singapore Noodles\"...  A yellow curry powder mixed in with the stir-fry oil/sauce.  Basic thin noodles, a few large chunks of prawn, a little barbecued pork, some peppers and onions.  I wasn't disappointed, but it wasn't anything real spectacular either.  The Thai Iced Tea tastes like every other Thai Iced Tea I've ever consumed, which is great and all.  I put Sriacha sauce on the noodles to get them a little more flavor and kicked up in spice.  Again, expectations were slightly higher than usual, because I thought a different place (in terms of perhaps menu, ingredients, ownership, etc.) might be an improvement.  But, I digress.  It was just a plain, ordinary, so-so restaurant.  My server was minimally attentive and wanted to play on his smartphone rather than work.  The electronica/techno/teenie-bopper music hasn't changed either.  Overall, I'm not necessarily saying this is a bad place.  The food is decent, but it's nothing \"special\" to me personally.  If I come back to this establishment, it will likely be because someone else suggests it (i.e. I'm tagging along)."}
{"text":"excellent food and interesting choices as well...very clean, tasty and oh so close!! so happy to have Bali Asian Bistro in our neighborhood."}
