{"text":"First tried a pour over in San Francisco, so found this place online. Great atmosphere, the server really made the experience exceptional , I think his name was Carlton. The pour over was smooth. Sure glad we made the trip here."}
{"text":"I came to Clockwork to get my morning fix and chose to go with what they're known for: their pour overs. I really enjoyed mine but being an espresso drinker, it was a little watered down. I have heard that the americano mistos are amazing so I will definitely be back to try that."}
{"text":"By far my favorite in downtown!  Coffee is just great! Since it's close to where I work, I am almost there daily. I tried their Chemex and pour over as well as espresso and Cortado - all are top notch and comparable to  other premium cafes around downtown.   Beans are provided by Hale Coffee Roasters (whom I subscribed with for bi-weekly bean deliveries - just great!) and the baristas are professional, knowledgeable, and passionate about their coffee. I usually deal with Julien and Jeremy who are both fantastic and super friendly - you can learn a lot from them in a minute or two while they're brewing your cup - just ask!  I had them deliver a few carafes once for a big annual meeting at work, and they impressed everyone with their coffee, professionalism, and most of all, a mini-espresso station which was manned by a super Barista - Khaled - for 30 minutes prior to meeting start - for free! Since then we have been getting them to provide our office every Friday - a treat for everyone before the weekend.  Highly recommend you go try their coffee and check for yourself. I know that everyone in our office runs by their store everyday."}
{"text":"I haven't had much experience with slow brew coffee, but I tried the Sun Dial blend and it's great. It goes down very smooth. They also have almond milk, but it tastes best black. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential!   The coffee barrister was incredible nice and made us feel at home but the coffee tasted horrible!   I've bee heavily drinking coffee for the past 10 years throughout the world, the best being in Vietnam with a poor over coffee.   So when I see this place does poor over coffee I'm in!   Sadly the coffee tasted like water and the grinds had clearly been overstrained so ended up resembling a cheap Instant coffee.   Also this place doesn't have a toilet....... Yeah that's right! I didn't even think that was legal in today's world but there you go.   So make sure you order an espresso otherwise you'll be in trouble!"}
{"text":"Like the coffee here. Could use some more selection of beans for the espresso based beverages, I find some other places nearby have more variety if you are looking for flavour in a shot/Americano style beverage. I do like Clockwork's cortado though! Milk frothed very nicely."}
{"text":"When you walk into this cozy coffee nook, immediately, you salivate for your morning dose of java as the room is filled with the aromatic scent of coffee, which essentially smacks you in the face, and wakes you right up. Also helps that this cafe has either great throwback tracks, or smooth jazz playing at all times.  The service is GREAT. The baristas were knowledgeable about their product, and made helpful recommendations. If you are lucky enough to encounter Carlton, rest assure that your experience will be above and beyond. Their cookies and muffins are supplied by the Red Bench, and I\"ve always been a fan of their baked goods.   Food: - Cortado: Rich, dark and dense in flavor. Must try! - Pour over coffee:  the process is meticulous, and done with care. Although I can't remember which beans were used, I do remember my coffee having a very full body, smooth, with not even a hint of acidity. I thoroughly enjoyed it. - Plain croissant:  flakey, delicious, buttery goodness. Pure deliciousness, highly recommend.   - Pistachio Croissant: ohhhhhhhhh myyyyyyyy! SO GOOD. my favorite. unique, and delicious.    The only catch about this place is that it is a take-out only place, with no seating. However, it is definitely worth trying, and I would definitely go back to try other backed goods, and an americano."}
{"text":"I always like stopping by here because the baristas are so friendly and seem to genuinely enjoy what they are doing.  Baked goods are always delicious and so tempting (when you weren't planning on having a treat) - brought in from another bake shop.  I come to enjoy their pourovers which are well priced and dripped with care.  A little out of the way at Adelaide/Toronto, which means you won't really stumble upon it unless you know it's there."}
{"text":"Great drip coffee and americanos. Very comfortable environment not douchy coffee snobs. Would make it my go to every morning."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem inside an office building on Toronto Street. I wish I had found out about it earlier. I actually found this place through the Indie Coffee Passport.   Check out the photos for the latte they made me and how the latte art stays and you will be able to tell how much care was put into their espresso.   I find so many places so careless with their lattes now and trying to hide the quality of their drinks with flavor shots. Come here for an amazing coffee or latte!"}
{"text":"One of, if not the best, pour overs in the city. Very reasonable prices (re happy hour latte). Their coffee is delicious and easily in my top 5 in the city (and I'm the worst kind of coffee snob). Their espresso drinks are also great, and if you're into syrups, they're homemade ones are dope. (Iced cinnamon latte? Helllllooo). Also, their decaf blend is great. It's the only drinkable decaf I've ever had and it is legitimately delicious."}
{"text":"Yup, pretty solid. Up to par with the good ones in the area (Dineen, SJCB, etc) but nothing exceptional. Not a great space for lingering as it shares a place with an eatery."}
{"text":"This isn't a review...but you do need to check your hours online. We're standing out here only to see you're closed...even though your website states that you're open."}
{"text":"Cute coffee place that shares the same door as Smash Juice Bar. Their lattes are reasonably priced, around $4 and similar to other coffee shops.   Their cookie selection is amazing. The toffee cookie was thin, soft and chewy. The barista even heats it up slightly before giving it to you."}
{"text":"Shared seating space with Rose City so the place will make you hungry if you're not careful.   Also, \"unsweetened\" is the default for their chai?! What!? And it's delicious!   Great selection of snacks available, including Naked Dates!!"}
{"text":"After reading a BlogTO post on this new coffee shop, I was tempted to try the #FastestSlowBrew (certainly a catchy \"slow\"gan).  The shop shares its space with both Rose City Kitchen and Smash Juice Bar, and is hard to miss this storefront on Adelaide.  Offerings here are simple - Chemex or Pour over (their specialties) and the typical espresso drinks such as Macchiato.  They also source croissants/sandwiches from Delysees (King W favourite!) and Cookies/Muffins from Red Bench.  On this visit I was intrigued by the Pour over process, and was informed that the drip from this mechanism (conical filter bottom) makes coffee taste \"better\" or really just less bitter and burnt than an average drip (which is flat bottom).  The \"slow\" brew Pour over comes from the fact that hot water is added multiple times, first to release the natural sugars then to fill up the rest of the cup; the fast, however, comes from the fact that this typically 10 minute process has been shortened to just about 2 minutes - and during rush times the Chemex mechanism is used to speed it up even further.  My barista used the Sun Dial blend and it indeed tasted quite smooth and I even forewent adding milk which is my norm.    Priced at $2.63 it's not significantly more expensive than a coffee at Starbucks, but given it is less convenient than locations in the path, I don't love it enough to become a regular, though may sneak here every now and then for accessible Delysees croissants."}
{"text":"Fantastic light roast. Tons of fruit and smoky nuances. Probably the best pour over in the city. Baristas super fun and helpful. Also had a brilliant quad cortado that I can honestly say is the best I've ever had in Canada. Mostly because it's the only one I've had in Canada ;).   Love this spot. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just happened to stumble across Clockwork Coffee. I just had a big lunch at Nami down the street and was jonesing a cup of coffee before heading back to my car. What caught my attention were all the devices to make drip coffee that can be seen from the window so I had to drop in. They share a space with Rose City Kitchen (I'm not sure if its owned by the same person/group), but Clockwork takes up a very small percentage of this already small space. This being said, they have seating so I was able to sip on my coffee at a table. Looking at the hours, it's geared to people who work/live downtown so I'm not sure when my next trip to Clockwork will be. If you're looking for an alternative to Starbucks and you're by Adelaide/Toronto, try Clockwork Coffee.  Good for: coffee"}
{"text":"Planned in advance for a visit before work, and they were closed. It showed they open at 7AM and I was there for 8:15AM.. Pretty disappointing. The first time I went there the one man working there was not pleasant and extremely dry."}
{"text":"Great coffee and a super nice barista  He hustles over the pour over stations while engaged in friendly banter   This a place for coffee snobs who demand a bit more in their coffee experience and refuse to sip and guzzle burnt 20 minute refreshed pots from the corporates  Sure they do fancy milk patterns but I just want a nice black coffee  They had Costa Rican and Ethiopian off the grinder with tasting notes to mull over while sipping  Entrance is off Adelaide  The place is smaller than a toronto king street condo"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Clockwork, due to recommendation from my coffee connoisseur friend. The coffee shop is located on the east end of financial district. It shares the same storefront with a juice bar and a gym, very hipster indeed. I had their flat white, which was quite tasty. Next time, I want to try their specialty coffee."}
{"text":"When I really, REALLY, need coffee and I'm able to get away for a short stroll, Clockwork Coffee is a go-to. Having tried the pour overs, the cortado, and the lattes, suffice to say... I'm a real fan. Strong coffee, tons of flavorful nuances, awesomely knowledgeable & friendly baristas! A+++.  You can order their pour over via Ritual to avoid the wait. Though, if you're here for a bit, there's shared seating with two other cool establishments: Rose City and Smash Juice Bar."}
{"text":"Was expecting a five star cup of coffee, got a barely recognizeable cup of hot water.  Note that I enjoy light and medium roasts mainly, so was not looking for a burnt bean cup of joe.  In this case, the pour over was a quick run through and probably not enough coffee in the basket.  If you are a coffee snob, skip this one and head down the street to farenheit or roosters... I tried a few coffee places on my visit and found them to be better."}
{"text":"I stumbled into Clockwork on a Monday morning with my co-workers, looking for any other coffee shop but Starbucks. Our initial reaction was that this was the perfect place - it's cutely decorated with clocks and gold handle pour-over contraptions on display, with only one barista. I ordered a simple Americano, while my friends ordered a Chemex pour-over (the specialty pour-over option) and a flat white. We were impressed by the process for the Chemex pour-over, as the barista hand poured the coffee in front of us.   Unfortunately, we were all disappointed with the taste and quality of the coffee beans. Despite the fancy setup of Clockwork, the coffee tasted like office instant coffee. I was unable to finish my Americano because of its taste. In my opinion, other coffee shops nearby such as Dineen and mos mos far exceed this place in terms of bean taste.  Overall Clockwork is a cute coffee shop that has potential - I just hope that the quality of the coffee improves in the future."}
{"text":"The quality of the product is exceptional (the coffee, but the snacks are pretty good too). They take their time and know what they're doing producing it. The staff are lovely. But their hours suck, and they don't even stick to the posted hours."}
{"text":"Made my morning with amazing latte and delish sandwich - cute latte art made morning so much better"}
{"text":"Polite and friendly staff. My 2 star is on my flat white. They gave me so much milk it was definitely more of a latte with extra milk that diluted the espresso. Probably the pour over coffee is better than their flat white and latte just by the other reviews."}
{"text":"After waiting an eternity for my coffee each time I've dropped by (read: long lines), I was all set to give this place an average 3 stars (especially after having a taste of their standard pour-overs from visits the last couple of months, which I found to be pretty average, although the Costa Rica blend was the delicious exception). However, today, I actually deviated from their standard pour-overs and ordered the Flat White, which I handled a lot better than the pour-overs.  The Flat White was wonderful, smooth, deep, and the flavour of the beans really stood out without being too overpowering. With the exception of the Costa Rica blend, which they have on the menu from time to time, I've found that the pour-overs are terribly overpowering, with a burnt aftertaste I couldn't shake, even after dousing it with milk.  Some offerings here are therefore better than others. It's not a bad option in the Financial District, and service is super friendly, but note that the only seating available is shared with Rose City Kitchen, which is located in the same unit. So, don't expect to find much seating here on your lunch hour. Size of the coffee is also an issue (smaller than most). Quality and value definitely doesn't exceed other coffee shop options in the area like Mos Mos, Dineen, and even Sam James. Overall, pretty good (with the Flat White being great!), but on the whole, this shop isn't the absolute best in the area.  For my Flat White, I paid around $3.75. The standard pour-overs are around $2.75."}
{"text":"The server girl was cute and easy going. Five stars.   Also the cappuccino was very good.   Nice big space to sit."}
{"text":"Had heard good reviews about this place and always santed to try it. But unfortunately, its closed on weekend! Got a chance to come in here on a Friday afternoon. Located on Toronto street and surrounded by restaurants, this small coffee place has a sit out shared with another eatery. Decent brown decor with loada of clocks gives a welcoming feel to this place. It was raining outside, so I ordered a lactose free decaf Cappuccino($3.75) to get a nice warm feel. Price included tax and the coffee had a lovely crema, nice latte art and oily tinge of fresh coffee bean extract on the surface, one that I always look out for, in a nice cup of coffee! I really enjoyed my coffee and shall return back to try other ones, especially the popular pour over!"}
{"text":"Service: The barista was super friendly and nice. He was also really informative about the different blends and type of coffees they carry. The service was just a bit slow, due to the fact that the barista had to man the cashier and make specialty pour over coffees at the same time. The line can get quite long if you come at the wrong time.   Ambiance: It's a nice little coffee shop attached with Rose City near the financial core. You can pair your coffee with a salad if you want a light lunch. Seats are limited if you want to dine-in.  Drinks: They carry a few coffees from different regions, and depending on the notes you prefer you can choose between getting it as an espresso or pour over. I usually get the pour over option if it's available. I found that the flavour profile wasn't as strong as I wanted it to be. They also carry a wide selection of teas."}
