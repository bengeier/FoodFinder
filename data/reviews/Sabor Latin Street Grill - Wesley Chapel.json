{"text":"A plethora of flavor.   This place just hits the spot when you are looking for a quick bite  of real Latin street food.    Everything is fresh, service is fast and friendly.     We ordered way too much because we couldn't decide.  The three best (in no particular order) were Carne Asada fries, Taco Locos, and the ground beef empanada.    The sauces at the self serve bar are extremely  delicious.   Just go easy on them.  You will really want to taste the food without the sauces first, because the food is just that good.   To top it off, the prices are reasonable.  You won't break the bank.   We are real fans in just two visits."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Had the taco salad and was so good. Better than I expected. We also bought the three amigos burrito and it was marvelous."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best Arepas! Love the Dominican Nachos! Everything we've had here is amazingness!"}
{"text":"Latin street food in Wesley Chapel! Nachos are HUGE! And the Carne Asada fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Great food and very authentic.  I sure hope this place lasts here as several others have come and gone. Kids and adults loved everything which is pretty rare in our family. The street food was a nice twist on similar burrito / taco / queso chains."}
{"text":"Dry cool little place. Not what we expected. Although it's counter ordering the meals were great, nachos where huge.  Very surprised by the look and feel. Fast food without the fast food feel.  Good experience, will continue to visit this one."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner a couple of weeks ago. Everyone was very friendly and we loved the nachos, tacos, and margaritas. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is quite good. I want to try the other items on the menu. They had a quinoa bowl and yuca smothered fries. Deadly. We had the nachos and the burrito. Be warned they are HUGE! What a nice addition to the Waxhaw Weddington area."}
{"text":"This place has the biggest burritos iv ever eaten. Good food that comes out quick with good customer service. Definitely will be picking this place over a Qdoba or Chipotle from here on out! 5 stars"}
{"text":"Getting our game on here with fresh guacamole, Pico, chips and cheese, doesn't get easier or better price is less they I can so it for"}
{"text":"Great house margarita and food is tasty!! Love the salsa bar and all at an excellent price. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Sabor is a great place for authentic Latin food. It's reasonably priced and the portions are generous. We go at least once/week to enjoy a good burrito bowl or authentic tacos. Great for the family and for some good healthy authentic Latin food."}
{"text":"Great Food and Friendly Faces, not always great service! A place where my whole family will eat everything on their plates. The food is good, nothing fancy, just a laid back atmosphere where you help yourself to your drinks and condiments, but they do serve adult beverages. The menu has a great variety and the price is right, even if it isn't listed as a daily special. It's delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and much needed for that area.  Always quick and friendly.  My only criticism is at check out the system asks to add a tip. Why? No service has been given yet.  Hate that.  Anyway, the food is good."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is good time come. Several of their tacos are only $1. The food is delicious!  The Mexican music adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great as usual. All locations are great. Authentic tacos are great. Nachos are HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent margarita!! The utensils are actually individually wrapped plasticware, which is awesome in my opinion - nobody's grubby hands or fingers touching them. Likewise, the salt & pepper are in individual packets.  Another WIN!  Ever watch people eating tacos, chicken, french fries, etc, and after licking their fingers, reach for the salt, pepper, ketchup, etc?  See my point?   The Elote Loco is excellent, but not necessarily something you would want to eat in front of someone that you're trying to impress - it's a bit messy, so make sure to check your teeth afterwards. ;) My Sabor margarita was served in a plastic solo-type cup, which was fine by me since the drink had a little kick to it.  Not to be overlooked is their salsa bar. A number of options, and each one tell you their heat factor.  This place is wonderful - which has been proven already in that they went from 1 restaurant to 6 in less than 10 years."}
{"text":"This was our first stop at the Matthews location after previous stops at the Steele Creek location.  The Mathews location is a better fit for us.  Much more seating and more family friendly.    We stopped in for an early Saturday dinner.  There was no wait and plenty of seating available.  The food arrived quickly and the portions were incredible.  $41 provided a meal for two adults and two kids, with some food not finished.  The portions are really generous though the food is so tasty you will not want to stop.  After reading many articles in the Charlotte Agenda about how wonderful Sabor is, we wanted to try many dishes.  My kids shared the supreme nachos, for a meal!  My wife and I even helped.  I had two tacos autenicos and a gordita....  yeah, I was a bit ambitious.   The tacos had so much meat on them.  For the price I expected half as much.  Tons of flavor and the cilantro sealed the deal.  My gordita was huge.  I loved the black beans inside.  I used some of the pineapple habenero salsa to spice things up.    We left stuffed and talking about how amazing the food was.  This was probably one of the best meals we have had in Charlotte which makes the price even more unbelievable.  We will be eating at the various Sabor often."}
{"text":"Love these tacos!! Sabor has the best tacos in Charlotte!! This location is kind of off the track in Matthews. We usually go to the Hawthorne location. Thankfully this location has the same excellent food! The chicken authenticos tacos are my favorite. They are juicy, flavored with cilantro and corn tortillas. Seriously they are amazing!!  We like the craft beers selection and the guacamole! Parking is easier at this location as it's in a huge lot by the 201 Central."}
{"text":"I love Sabor overall . . . But this location is my absolute favorite! ,They have the best staff and management of any food and beverage team I have seen (and I have seen a lot.)  The long haired fellow who mixed my mojito tonight takes the time to crush the mint leaves and then pours the alcohol into the same container so it can get the oil infusion from the crushed mint leaves into the drink.  When an employee takes this kind of personal interest and pride in their work it's clear that leadership is hiring well and training well.  Bravo to my bartender buddy for making his restaurant something extraordinary . . . and cheers to the uber-friendly manager too!"}
{"text":"BRING A JACKET! It's freezing in here, somewhere are 60Â° ...BUT anywho...   THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE! So I've been here like 6 times now and I usually just go with the Venezuelan arepas which are to die for but today I got the tacos, autenticos which are really authentic and yummy! My mom got the saborita, which is two tortillas with a party in between. Love everything about this place (except the freezing temps) also the lady at the register with the NY accent is really sweet. The staff is super friendly :)"}
{"text":"The food was good but service unorganized for counter ordering. I went in with a groupon and I have 1 more so I will go again. I'm not a clean freak but salsa bar was messy along with eat in area looked worn."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I had the empanada with ground beef and another with chicken. It was soooooo delicious. My son had the elote which is corn and he ate all of it. Very tasty. The staff was super nice.   Everything was great. I will definitely come back. Top places to eat in Matthews North Carolina for sure."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh Sabor. You are honestly the best. The queso and chips make me glad to be alive. My fave is the chicken empanada because it's perfection deep fried in love with a side of dipping sauce made from angel tears."}
{"text":"Reluctantly tried this place out in wesley chapel thinking it wouldn't be good, was I ever in for a treat!  The food is really good and there are many options from authentic Latin street food to Americanized mexican. We had the empanadas and authentic tacos, with el pastor, chicken, and steak. All three were really good and very tender flavorful meat. The shredded chicken is so juicy and flavorful!  Theirs a nice salsa bar with some really unique hot flavors. The place is really clean and quick with order at counter style dining. I would have given 5 stars, but the margaritas were commercial tasting with that sweet sour mix that screams college margarita. All in all, can't wait to go back and try more menu items. Great beer selection as well, offering some local noda brew as well in cans. I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a break from American mexican speedy #6 meals."}
{"text":"Took my son and his friend here tonight for the first time, to try the $1 Tacos.  (Every Tuesday).  The quality of the tacos was top of the line.  Great flavors, and i couldn't believe we were getting them for $1 each!  Looks like they have great daily specials, so I'll be back with the entire family to try more.  Definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"Great food and value. Daily specials are worthwhile and looking forward to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Delicious, unpretentious food served fast with fresh ingredients.  Quinoa protein bowls, fish tacos,  arepas...all great!"}
{"text":"One of the best value deals in South Charlotte for Latin/Mex food. Love the chicken arepas with crazy tasty refried beans. Get the chips and load up at the salsa bar. Margaritas for the adults and Jarritos for the kids round out the package."}
{"text":"Very basic fast food tacos. Beef was tough. Chicken was dry. Would not recommend. It is one of the cheapest places to eat tacos. So there is that...."}
{"text":"this is our go to place . they have great everything. you must try one of everything. they don't have much seating when busy but they do have seating outside when it is warmer weather. they have a great kids menu.. they even have specials for each night of the week. you can even order and pay online then go in and pick it up."}
{"text":"Good food, nice selection of beer and super fast service. I also love the salsa bar...excellent selection of yummy options! The prices are very reasonable as well. So glad we have a place like this so close to home!"}
{"text":"Paid with my debit card and had to leave a tip. Options were 15%, 20%, 25%, and cancel transaction. How do I leave a tip before we've been served? Plus, all they are doing is bringing my food to me. A tip for that?"}
{"text":"Tried Sabor for the first time tonight and was underwhelmed. Maybe it's better when you go in versus getting it to go. We ordered the elote loco, chicken nachos, burritos (steak and steak/chicken combo), chicken empanada, chicken veg w/black bean quesadilla, steak tacos authenticos, and guacamole. The elote was very disappointing ... not the grilled street corn that I'm used to. There was no flavor and the corn was steamed. The burritos and quesadillas were not made to order either.  The order was read back to me, a mistake corrected and the young man read it back correctly a second time. I would recommend a visual inspection of the order next time.  I had heard great things about the nachos and they looked great from the pictures. This was a miss for me ... The nachos were packaged all together and were a soggy mess once we got them home (we live less than 10min away). I should have asked, but I assumed that they would have packaged toppings in one container and chips in another. Not the case. If ordering takeout I would definitely ask them to do this! The flavor was bland.  Now on to more of the positives.... The guacamole was simple and delicious. I ordered the shrimp taco (prepared authentic style) and thought it was well seasoned and pretty tasty. Unfortunately, everything on the menu felt like I could have prepared it at home and with more flavor.   One major plus ... The staff were really helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"My family LOVES Sabor!  Nothing fancy about the place at all but the food is great!  We are foodies and we moved here from Jersey where good food of all varieties is plentiful. So we're always looking for good places down in our new home state. We have been here probably six times since June. Love it and the prices are decent too."}
{"text":"The wife & I come to this local spot often.  We are back today & simply love how fresh and delicious it always is."}
{"text":"I always enjoy grabbing a bite from Sabor. My favorite go-to order is the fish taco. They aren't skimpy with the meat and it is tasty with just a squeeze of the accompanying lime. I also enjoy ordering a side of chips so that I can really sample the salsas. $5 mojitos on Thursday nights are also something to look forward to!"}
{"text":"What a local gem!!  You can literally get authentic Mexican street food here.  The burritos are huge and delicious.  The street corn could not be more authentic.  The unexpected bonus were the reasonably priced cocktails and beers.   This will be a regular jaunt for us moving forward.  The manager Luis is the bomb.   Came back for a second time and food was equally awesome!"}
{"text":"Street food!??  Must be, I ordered from Wesley Chapel location on Saturday night a few different dishes,  I was vomiting and on the toilet all day Sunday I will never order from this restaurant again, something was definitely  wrong with the  food......completely  dissatisfied! !  Did anyone else notice the food score was 97!!!"}
{"text":"It has a more varied menu than your typical Latin restaurant. There is an excellent salsa bar with all sorts of fresh salsa to try. I would recommend calling ahead if you are ordering to go, because they can get busy. Very good burritos."}
{"text":"I'm from Miami and I moved here and thought they wouldn't have a lot of good Spanish restaurants like they did back home, but once me and my gf came in it was amazing, the food is great, the music is all Latin, and the place has great service here. This will definitely be the place where all my friends will go to for good latin food      Neta es el lugar mas chido que e encontrado"}
{"text":"We get take out from here about once a week.   Best nachos in the area.  I love the build your own bowl for a low carb option.  Our son opts for tacos americanos.  They often are busy, but work through the queue quickly and efficiently.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've only had the carne asada fries and tasted the quesadillas. Both were delicious. The service is slow but i think they make everything fresh and the servers are nice. The salsa bar is meh but that might just be a matter of taste."}
{"text":"If I can give it four and a half stars I would give it four and a half stars. Wie have been trying different things on the menu and we really enjoy it. Everything is fresh and alot of food for the money. Of course I love coming here on Fridays for the Friday margaritas!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT. We came here for Taco Tuesday, and this is as good as it gets if you enjoy Latin/Mexican fare. We ordered the Tacos Autenticos w/ shredded chicken to go, and I got the Taco Salad which is excellent. We also ordered the Nachos Supreme with steak, which is delicious, and HUGE. Salsa bar is outstanding, please try the Verde salsa. It is the best avocado-based salsa I have ever had! Definitely worth it. The guy who helped us gave great suggestions and told us about all their food/alcohol specials they have throughout the week, and seemed to really enjoy his job which is very refreshing. I highly recommend Sabor. We are going to try to go once a week if possible!"}
{"text":"This place makes very delicious food. Everything seems to be made to order but either way it tastes great. The employees are very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The only issue is that it's going to start getting cooler outside and they don't have a large enough establishment. We sat outside once and are a wonderful meal but had to leave midway because we couldn't handle the weather with jackets on and the restaurant was full."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time with the family. We ordered the Supreme Nachos w/ shredded chicken, and the Sabor Especial. Was extremely impressed with everything, including the service, quality of food, and the flavor! The portions are huge...we couldn't finish everything. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome.   Nachos are the best I've ever had .   Tacos are great and even better on taco Tuesdays  when the are just a dollar each.  Salsa bar has 6 or 7 different homemade salsas.  Very reasonable prices.  Spent twenty bucks for food, drink and tip for 2 people.  Could not even finish the nachos."}
{"text":"One major concern is not many menu options. It's ok to have it once a month. Quality is good. Dine in tables not clean and too cramped. Go for takeout"}
{"text":"Great counter service restaurant in Wesley Chapel. Nice selection of food options. The nachos are HUGE, definitely enough to share!  Alcoholic drinks options are somewhat limited, but the do offer  several can/bottles of beer, as well as some mixed drinks, such as margaritas. Service is fast and friendly. I have pre- ordered individual lunches for 16 people......they had the order ready for pick up at the specified time and each order was individually boxed, bagged and labeled for easy identification.  Food has always been delicious during each visit. I highly recommend Sabor for a quick easy meal"}
{"text":"Just tried Sabor Latin Street Grill in Indian Trail where Genaros used to be. By the Sports Clips (Walmart mall). It's pretty good! All fresh, hand made food. Large empanadas (beef, chicken, vegetable, chorizo),  beef arepas (cheese and ground beef stuffed) yucca frita, soft tacos. They will have take out menus in a week and liquor license in a month but only beer. I recommended they have at least a red wine or sangria. My personal favorites were the guacamole  (with onion, tomatoe in it) and the shredded chicken over quinoa with sliced avocados on it. I think it was a bowl. Fresh cilantro and lime. The chicken wasn't as salty (not a criticism, I just don't do salt) as the ground beef so I personally enjoyed it more. Chorizo was good with just the right bit of spice to it. I'd recommend more lime especially for the chicken, great!!! Loved the guacamole,  my favorite I even ate it with a fork and put it on my food :) They redid the inside too and the prices are fantastic. I walked out with three bags of food for about $42 and I tried all the main dishes. I forgot to try the beans - next time."}
{"text":"Never knew this place was even there until my wife told me about it. This place is excellent! Best Mexican food I've had in years. Also, the service was excellent and the staff was professional. I highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Very large portions and very tasty. This is our new go-to place in Wesley Chapel when we want something different. I'd suggest the nachos, but bring a large, very large appetite."}
{"text":"Food was really yummy. The nachos are huge and taste great.  The staff were very friendly and helpful on our first visit"}
{"text":"Sabor is awesome!!! I see why the won for \"best nachos in Charlotte,\" they are amazing!! Highly recommend eating here if you haven't!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, though not quite as flavorful as the Elizabeth location.   I had the chorizo autenticos which were very good as well as the street corn which was delicious.   The review would be a SOLID four stars  BUT   the website gave my MacBook a virus that I'm still struggling to remove from my computer.  Not cool at all."}
{"text":"Ordered 12 tacos, two large sides, guac, two drinks, and obligated tip = $77+. When paying with a card, why am I being asked to add tip of 15%+ when I am not being waited on? Why does the steak taste like soy sauce? How the heck is one steak taco $3.75?!!!  There was absolutely nothing great about the steak tacos. Not tender, juicy, and full of orgasmic flavor that would make me okay to pay $4 for one darn funny tasting taco. Very large chunky steak that has a heavy taste of being marinated in soy sauce. I love the large pieces of steak but the marinade was an absolute turn off. The mexican rice was average and the refried beans a bit salty.  The salsa bar is a nice touch but I did not favor any of the ones I tried.  Great concept but overpriced and not truly authentic based on places like the taco kings I love- Las Asadas, El Patron, or Pasadita in Chicago."}
{"text":"Good food, but expensive. Went here with the hubby and paid nearly $10 for a chicken quesadilla.. with nothing else in it besides cheese, and didn't even come with sides or a drink."}
{"text":"Eat here frequently and really enjoy many of the menu offerings.  Casual and inviting.  Good staff.  Great food quality.  Excellent choice if you're looking for a quick bite with Latin flair.  Try the nachos or tacos authenticos, you cannot go wrong with either."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about Sabor for months and have been meaning to try it to the point that my friends started buying me gift cards here. I finally got over here with a friend and it was quite a treat! We came on a Sunday night and this location was not too crowded and there was plenty of parking. We ordered nachos and a burrito to share. We ended up taking an absurd amount of food home as the nachos are a mountain and the burritos are stuffed to the brim. The nachos were warm and delicious with a great texture. We had chicken as the protein and it was great. Our steak burrito was alright, I much prefer the chicken to the steak. We also ordered adult beverages in the form of a beer and a margarita, and my margarita was well made. To top it all off this place is extremely affordable. Our whole ginormous meal with alcohol was under 25 bucks. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local eatery. Delicious food with great staff and tremendous specials (you must go on Taco Tuesday!).  We love their taco's, empanadas, quesadillas, and especially their salsa bar. Wow. Can't wait to go again : )"}
{"text":"Beef empanadas: I dream of you!! I wake in the night craving them!! SERIOUSLY! I also had the steak taco americana -- it is amazing. LOVE LOVE LOVE. GREAT staff too!"}
{"text":"This Wesley Chapel location is close by and I am glad.  It seems like these Sabors have suddenly popped up everywhere.  Four of us went for lunch today. For awhile, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  We were debating on whether this is a fast food place.  If it weren't for the fact that you order and pay at the counter, it would clearly not be a fast food joint.  The quality and freshness of the food suggest otherwise. They know what they are doing here! Today I built my own burrito bowl with quinoa and shredded chicken. It was simply delicious. Was tempted to get some \"street food\" with chicken and yuca fries.  I will save that for next time.  Whatever you do, try the pineapple salsa on the salsa bar.    It is sweet, but has a kick.  And that sums up my experience today, it was a kick. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We come here very often.  They are extremely nice and friendly.  They always change up the food in any way we need (lots of allergies) and never over charge us.  Honest folks, efficient, good home made type food, great atmosphere.  Upscale restaurants should take a few pointers from these kind folks"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and authentic. We lived in Houston and Chicago and have been looking for a place with quality Latin street food. Been 3 times and the food has been consistently great. The Sabor Burrito is excellent."}
{"text":"Wow!  We never knew this little gem of a place was just a few miles from home. Loved the authentic food choices. The staff were friendly and the food was very good.  I had the Elote Loco and Taco Locos and we ordered Guacamole to share.  Everything was really good and we will definitely come and visit Sabor again!"}
{"text":"The carne asada fries are perfection so I usually stick with those. Most recently I had a random craving for a quesadilla and it did not disappoint. The chicken was shredded just right and perfectly cooked. Service is fast and friendly. Prices are reasonable. Drink selection is great."}
{"text":"I have been to Sabor on Hawthorne and 7th street quite a few times. We decided to try the one in Matthews ?? Not sure if it is Matthews or Weddington or Waxhaw. Its in the \"country\" But it is a GREAT grill. Located in a strip mall where the Harris Teeter 201 is . The Food was  even better than the one on 7th. Its always good, don't get me wrong but this was particularly fresh and good. Two of my party had the Quinoa bowls with Pork and Avocado. Fresh and good. I had empanadas  with chicken and the wonderful Mexican Corn with the cheese and spices on it!. Everything was quick but had the great flavor of country!. Of course the Pineapple Habanero salsa is sooooo good, the whole salsa bar is fantastic! I would highly recommend any of the Sabor locations..this one has a special place in my mind now!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. Veggie nachos were amazing; served on a large pizza pan, not a plate! Loaded with grilled zucchini and other veggies, topped with queso, cojito cheese, lettuce tomato, etc. Beware - small space, limited seating. Great prices, excellent portions."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at this restaurant. We loved it!    They were very accommodating with their menu. Tom and Kelly went out of their way to make it a very pleasant experience.  They make everything from scratch daily; we found it to be a very healthy place to eat."}
{"text":"These are the nachos I was just served. I got a refund and walked out. I have been coming to this place since it opened and the nachos were obscene in terms of portion size. This looks like something you could get at Taco Bell. I spoke to the manager and all he did was give me a refund because I asked for it. He made no excuse for ever decreasing size of the nachos. Don't waste your time with these because they taste great and you will be left wishing you had more."}
{"text":"Tried based on positive reviews from friends and Yelp. Went for early lunch on a Sunday. Crowd was light. Menu has a good variety. Took note of daily specials which is always a bonus. Sunday special is $1.50 domestic beers. Ordered 1 grilled chicken Authentico (corn tortillas), 1 fish taco, and an order of the Dominican nachos (Yucan fries instead of chips) All were delicious  and authentic tasting! If burritos are your thing, we saw a couple of customers order them and they are huge! All of this is exciting for me because it's a quick ride up the road instead of my usual 20-25 min drive for authentic Mexican flavor.   Service was nice and quick. Will definitely be back as a regular."}
{"text":"Best nachos in charlotte. $6.95 and its tough ,I mean a real challenge, to finish it off.  Also, half off craft beers on Saturday's. It's a legit deal."}
{"text":"Authentic.  Cheap.  Fast.   Perfect customer service...and 5 minutes from our house - how can we lose?!  Is it as good as the street tacos we enjoyed in San Francisco before we moved?...it is close enough that we will be back OFTEN.  WELL DONE...WELL DONE!!!"}
{"text":"I love Sabor's and they have dollar tacos on Tuesday. The portions are amazing and the nachos are easily for 2-3 people depending on how much you eat. Staff had always been very helpful and friendly. My favorite part is the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"As much as Id love to give Sabor a 5-star, I cant.  The food is Great.  Two nights in a row, different cashiers took the wrong orders, both on the phone & in person.  We had missing items on a pick up, and missing items in the restaurant. When we asked about our additional entree, we were left sitting for forty minutes, although we asked the waitress, cashier & manager about this several times.  Finally, we were told it was not on the order.  Really?  Were we offered the $3.95 item free? NO. Did they offer to make it & let us pay? NO.  Couldnt they have told us the error within ten minutes? Guess not.   We spent $90 there one night, $50 the next night.  Sad to say, we will NOT return.  This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is likely my favorite in carnation of Sabor - just wish that they were closer to home. The service is great, the food comes out quickly and they are often busy, echoing what you want to see in a street grill, where everyone pops in for that neighborhood feel.  Solid selection of beer, and of course they have the salsa bar, which just makes life a little better when you visit. The only downside is the location - it's heading into the soft drink station, so it can get a little cramped back in that corner. Still well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Selection is great for someone who wants to eat somewhat healthy but feel like they are eating bad.  I customize the avocado bowl by adding chicken and asking for little oil and light on the seasoning. Love the lime yogurt sauce and always get extra. There is also a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options.  So glad this place is right around the corner from my house!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. It is all fresh and incredibly flavorful. They turn out good quickly and provide a comfortable dining space. It isn't the fanciest place but it is clean, well organized, and is get a lot of bang for your buck. I was astounded at how low the bill was given the quality of the food. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great option when craving some Latin food. Eat here once a week. None of it knocks it out of the park, but I would consider the variety of Latin dishes fun and definitely worth the price!  The Latin sodas and beer to accompany the dishes make this place great! Props to the owners for bringing in something original to the area! Local peeps, support this place!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and I ordered the Venezuelan arepas. Arepas were crispy stuffed with cheese and chicken. The Chips were good and there is a salsa bar, I only like the mild one, the salsa verde didn't taste like anything . My husband ordered the American tacos, he thinks it was just ok. This place has an arepa and empanada special on Thursday and I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing all the good reviews it had. I ordered the tofu ranchero burrito. It was really bland, to be honest. Not bad, just bland. I had to add salt and a bunch of salsa from the free salsa bar to give it flavor. It also un-rolled itself after two bites, and I had to finish it with a fork. I'll probably come back and try something different another day."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! Street food specialities, the Carne Asda fries are awesome, topped with guacamole, queso fresco, tomatoes, onions. The nachos are to die for and huge. Crisp thin corn tortillas topped with steak , queso, guacamole, lettuce, black beans, etc.   Yes they serve alcohol! I had a Paloma-grapefruit soda, tequila and lime and my husband a beer.   This is a smaller storefront restaurant with booths on one wall and a few tables. Very casual with a flat screen tv, and lots of people carrying out."}
{"text":"I've been to the location in Charlotte (Hawthorne Lane) and only tried the tacos there. At this location, I branched out and tried other items on their menu along with tacos of course.   I had the quinoa avocado bowl (name might be a bit off) and I created a bowl. The bowl was disappointing. I chose grilled steak as my protein but I barely had any in there. It felt more like a vegetarian option for me. As for the quinoa and avocado selection, it tasted....healthy. The avocado was great and the sauce that came with it was tasty but there was nothing memorable about it. I'm so glad we still ordered tacos because I devoured those. I wish they had chicharron as an option!   Service was great though, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent, they have a mound of nachos that's like $6. However last time we went my son ordered chicken nuggets and they were raw; they told me their freezer had broke the night before so everything un-thawed and they couldn't get it to fry properly. Why they served it to me after it un-thawed I don't know. They replaced it with a quesadilla. The kids working were very nice about it, and when I say kids I mean kids. Couldn't have been out of their teens. The place had a ton of flys and the salsa bar needed some tlc."}
{"text":"First time I got tacos from here and they were absolutely amazing I had gotten them on a Tuesday and I was craving more the entire week!! So I finally got a chance to go back and I got the chicken tacos to go and was so excited when I got home to dig in well the chicken on my tacos were raw and to me were very plane i was extremely disappointed so I took them back and they apologized and replace them which was great and the right thing to do and they were great! I went back a few weeks later and got chicken and steak tacos once again I found myself excited to dig in and experience the food as I had my first time but I did not once again the chicken was raw in the middle and to me the steak had this teriyaki flavor. So I have not been back since then."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Sabor. We ordered nachos and the Dominican nachos. Sadly, the cheese was nonexistent on the nachos. My husband had to go to the counter and ask for two ramekins to cover the mountain of chips. The Dominican nachos were good except the yuca was mushy and not a crispy fried wedge. Add the sauce and other toppings and it was a basket of cabbage mush.  We will come back again for the tacos but will ask for the yuca fries to be extra crispy."}
{"text":"YUM. My mom and I ate here for lunch, and we both enjoyed everything that we ordered. The food took me back to LA...if you've been out west, you'll know that this is a great compliment. You order at the front, then pick your table and your food will be brought out to you. We got the Elote Loco (corn w/ mayo, cojito cheese, and chili powder) from the \"street food\" section. My mom got the chicken empanada, I got the Curtido fish taco, and of course we got guac. First of all...THE CORN. That was by far my favorite part of the lunch. My moms empanada had shredded chicken and and cheese inside, she really enjoyed it and said the flavor was all there. My tilapia taco was so so so good. It had what they call curtido slaw which I believe is some sort of pickled cabbage and carrots, along with tomatoes and cilantro. The fish was grilled and cooked to perfection. The price of everything is pretty reasonable also. Another aspect that I like about the place is that it is very vegetarian friendly. Being a vegetarian, it was nice to see that there were many different options for me to have. They also have a salsa bar, which is a plus. If this was just based on food, they'd receive 5 stars. The reason I give them 4 stars is because they could definitely use a makeover, and the wait service is kind of non existent. It would be nice if the servers checked up on you everyone and a while. Besides that, the food was awesome, and I will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Good cheap food.  The nachos are too big but overall good...messy and overloaded.  Everything is a little citrus infused, so it's not your typical American Mexican food.  More a blend of Latin and food truck.  The salsas are the only disappointment as they have 5 or more but aren't very tasty.  Overall it's a great value for food."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of tacos but tried this place with a friend that recommended it and I was extremely impressed the food was well seasoned and extremely tasty!  They have a daily special and now Tuesday Tacos has become one of my favorite days!  You must also try the Dominican Nachos!  You'll OD on them!"}
{"text":"Summer time spot to go. Just be aware abt lunch time gets pretty busy.  After a 2 hour workout the protein bowl can't be beat. Ni que decir!   Carne Asada sweet potatoe Fries & Elote Corn.. Whaat!"}
{"text":"Loves the street corn and the salsa choices. Fish taco and chicken authentic taco were fresh and good, but a bit dry and overstuffed, not as flavorful or juicy as possible. But the great salsa helped a lot! Very nice beer and drink selection, but a bit slow service wise for Mexican. Would go again though!"}
{"text":"This is a updated review going from 3 stars to 4. When I first came on a taco Tuesday I simply wasnt impressed but a few weeks ago I got take out (tacos, 4 chicken 1 beef, and a chicken empanada.) I must say that the flavors were on point especially with the light pink sauce on the bar. I will definitely be back for taco Tuesday when I return from my business trip"}
{"text":"The burrito bowls are excellent!  And large enough that I'm pretty sure I'm going to be eating it for lunch and dinner tomorrow.  Sort of disappointed that the elote Loco wasn't grilled. I feel like it would add so much flavor to the corn; but it was good still without being grilled. A must try if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"Great food. Tried several items. Really enjoyed the nachos. Had a few items that were pretty salty. Had the same salty experience twice with 2 different items."}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place! My family of 5 enjoyed this place so much. It was so nice to sit outside and enjoy the breeze.... and the food was amazing. It's family friendly, plenty of seating and the food came so fast.  Everyone loved everything and there are lots of leftovers!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
