{"text":"In town for work from Atlanta. Well I am sitting here ( I've been here for about 20min) waiting for someone to come to my table. I've yet to be greeted, and I am extremely hungry. The sign at the door says \"please seat yourself\". I just don't understand the purpose of that if the employees aren't able to keep up with who comes in. There are only maybe 7 tables occupied, so it can't be blamed on a crowd. Maybe they are short staffed? Not sure, but I'm not happy."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday night around 7pm, place was 1/2 full and we picked a seat right away.  This may be the first downside to the place, we set ourselves at a high-top in the bar and waited at least 2-4 min before a manager(?) came over to ask if we'd been helped (even though we'd seen many waitresses pass by), we told him no and he left to find someone.  Our waitress finally came over and took our drink order and returned with drinks to take our food order.  The beer order was wrong (after we told her the correct one 3 times and she still kept getting them confused) and she then asks if it would still be ok to take the wrong one, we responded no.  In my opinion unless your giving it to us on the house its not our order and we'd like it corrected.  They finally did but it took a while to get our drinks out, which were only draft beers.  We also ordered the sampler appetizer, which never came until our meal, we asked about the delay and she responded the kitchen was backed up.  When it arrived, with our meal, we could tell they were frozen items (ravioli and mini tacos, and wings) so not sure what the delay was. Our burgers were good, but the size of the burger in relation to the bun wasn't.  Personally I thought you lost the taste of the burger and toppings in all the bread and ended up taking one piece of the bread off.  Price points were good, tons of TVs, service was not impressive for a new restaurant with so many competitors nearby.  Thankfully we visited with a groupon."}
{"text":"Good portion sizes to go along with decent prices on the food. If they had a better variety of daily drink specials this place this place would be hard to compete with. Overall it's a very good sports bar and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to this establishment in May 2016 just after opening and the limited menu was great and service was good as well. However, just went back this week (October 5) and the service was beyond horrible. The server wrote down our food request and still it was all wrong. The manager was almost to the point if being rude. We didn't ask for the manager to come over. He did that on his own because his server screwed everything up, even after coming back to our table to ask what we had ordered because she couldn't find her paper with our order. The manager said it was her 1st day After she had told us it was her 5th day. Still charged for the screwed up meal. That's okay, but will NEVER go back. no wonder there were a total of 5 people in the place during lunch hours. Service was the worst and I did it for a long time myself. No excuse for management to be an ass hat either. we didn't complain until he asked. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"I am from St. Louis, and my family and I were so excited that Hot Shots was opening in Charlotte NC! They have this cheese called Provel, which is a St. Louis favorite:) The pizzas are so good, as well as their toasted ravioli.  My family and I can't wait to go back and try their happy hour food specials (they are week days from 3-6pm).  We had pretty good and attentive service, and the place was much more family friendly than other bars in the area.  The restaurant is spacious and would be a great place to watch a game with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Waitress was hot AF. Nice blond tight booty. Although wheels on the other hand was a douche. Had horrible customer service experience. The sandwich was rotted and he exchanged it and when I asked for a discount or just anything he said he did me a favor by swapping it out. Guess I'm suppose to eat moldy bread. Thank you king of unimpressive girls and rascal scooters."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I have gone 3 times and the bartenders are always rude. The service ia slow. The place is dirty. My food is horrible. My orders are never right. The cooks shoot heroin in the bathroom. No thanks. Awful experience again tonight."}
{"text":"If you enjoy waiting for food that sits at the window for 20 minutes so it is cold and 30-40 minutes between your waitress getting you drinks then this is the place for you.  Will be mismanaged in to the ground"}
{"text":"Only gets 1 star as the food,  when they finally got orders right, tasted good. So much potential,  so much disappointment. It is set up really nice with tons of tv's, pool tables,  darts, decent sized bar and plenty of seating. First off, there were only 2 other tables when we go there at 6:40 on a college football Saturday this past weekend.  I was shocked. Now I understand why. Our server was awful. First, we ordered wings which were supposed to br spicy gatlic and extra crispy. We got galic parmesian garlic, soggy as hell with ranch. Then, my wife, who is lactose intolerant, ordered a burger with no cheese and mushrooms on a pretzel roll with fries. She went out of her way to say she is allergic to dairy twice to the waitress. No matter, the waitress paid no attention. My friend's wife ordered a regular cheeseburger with fries.  When they first came out, my wife got a cheeseburger with 2 mushrooms on a pretzel roll and the other girl in our party got a hamburger on a regular roll. They took them back and when they came out the second time and my wife got a cheeseburger again on a pretzel roll with potato chips and the other one came out as a hamburger on a regular with mushrooms and fries. Third times the charm I guess. Finally got it right. 

My friend ordered a wrap with no tomatoes. Guess what he got in his wrap?  Yep - tomatoes. My kids ordered an burger which was supposed to have marinara sauce as the dressing. Hey, guess what wasn't on it?  Yep, the marinara sauce. 

The runners were great but the waitress was terrible but I can totally understand, I mean, she did have 1 other table.  Their beer menu was limited but it had one or two good ones on it. The funny part after messing up 80% of our order, she showed no remorse and actually got pissy with us like it was somehow our fault. I will never go back. With service and attitude like this, they will jot be in business long. Too many other good choices. This was probably the worse place I have eaten in the Concord Mills area. I can't believe her attitude and how she never apologized or comped us anything. The only thing she gave us for free was her opinion of how much of an inconvenience we were to her.  FIRST AND LAST TIME!"}
{"text":"I think Helen Keller could have a better time at his place I wasted my money  I believe this should have stayed a Quaker stake and lube next time I'll just eat razor blades and drink bleach"}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. The service is great and the food is fast - great wings! Hot Asian flavor is the best!!!"}
{"text":"If you have small children and do not want to hire a babysitter this place is PERFECT for you!.
The Friday night entertainment consisted of a slew of young, untamed,rambunctious, rug rats, roaming freely throughout. 
It's fun to watch their cute little faces, as they toss a cue ball from another table onto yours and your balls scatter everywhere. 
They are so nimble and quick. It's thrilling to see them first hand as they approach another table and repete their show.  At that point you will will be able to enjoy the frustrated looks on your fellow patrons. OMG, aren't they sooooo cute!
Once you become more familiar with these entertainers, you will be able to notice some of the side show antics.  Some of which included sipping adult drinks and sampling food from some of your fellow show goers,( Please leave ATF out of this, it's all in good fun)  pool cue sword fights, foot races, wrestling and screaming. 
The cuisine is exquisite. For example, order the salsa and chips and will be served 15-20 Santiago chips (1.99 per bag at Publix)  and a small bowl of slightly waterdown salsa.
The mixed drinks are maticulasly pourn from pre mixed containers and then seasoned with a splash of your favorite alcohol.
Unfortunately a night out with this magnitude doesn't come cheap. But I guess if you figure in the babysitter savings, the free food and drinks for your young'ens and the vast amount of exercise they will get. It may just be the perfect place for you!
Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"It's a cool place to grab a beer and watch some sports. The buffalo wings are really good too. The service on the other hand could use some fine tuning. I realize they only opened a few days ago and that's why it's 4 stars and not 3."}
{"text":"Service was beyond horrible. After 30 minutes we just left. 
I'd give it zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"I'm convinced anyone on here writing that the food is good, is either affiliated with the place or works there. It's a cool place to hang out if you want to go grab a drink and play pool. However the food is absolutely disgusting. I ordered their \"famous\" tacos and I kid you not, there was a slice of cold American cheese on every taco. What the f***? 

The place is huge and has such potential but the service and food is horrid.

Bottom line if you want to shoot some pool and grab a drink, try it out. Otherwise, go else where."}
{"text":"WOW we stopped in for a pregame before our movie and were absolutely disgusted. The beer on Tap was sour, not a SOUR beer, but a skunky wet slime sour.  We ordered fried Ravioli and mozzarella sticks and they were the worst we ever had. Water shot from Ravioli and were cold in the middle. The outer skin was too dark and tasted like burnt oil. It was soggy and cold. The sauce was ketchup with parsley on top for the most part. It was all very cheap quality frozen food that now had been poorly prepared. Now they have .25 cent draft beer on Thursdays and cops sit and wait to give out DUI's like candy! .25 cent beer is an attempt to empty the rotten kegs on Tap to keep them fresh. No thank you. And please, CLEAN YOUR BATHROOMS!!!"}
{"text":"They had just opened so the menu was incomplete.  I got the ravioli and wings,  both were world class.  Service was really cordial but not overly attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch during the week the other day after hearing about this via a Concord local who received a flyer in the mail. Apparently after a good while, these guys moved in to the old Quaker Steak building. 

Even though I miss Quaker Steak, my first impression was that they definitely renovated well and this could definitely be a good thing. Pretty decent place for sports watching and hangin out with the guys. Great set-up with TV's, darts, pool tables, etc. LARGE bar. 

Between food and drink, it's really just your typical bar food with semi-decent selection of brew. The food was pretty good, on a \"bar food\" scale I'd give it an 8. I just don't think that sober eating is the way to go here. Ideally coming back up for some football games with a couple of drinks is a must... which I plan to do...

Staff was friendly. I was extremely disappointed not one of them had on their referee attire as in the flyer. MISLEADING."}
{"text":"This place is good but has a lot of work ahead of them to be successful. The food and atmosphere were great. However, when the staff knows nothing about the beers on tap, nor did they care to learn, it makes it difficult for a visitor to wanna stick around and keep drinking.  In addition, don't allow your staff to eat or drink behind the bar or sit in little circles and chat, it makes it very uncomfortable for the customer.  
Lastly, in my opinion, I would have marketed the heck out of this place, especially during the 10 days of Nascar in Charlotte. I get it was a quick opening, but, having specials or even taking coupons to the local hotels to let people know you are here, would have been my first steps.   I want to see places like this do good, but be cautious of the staff that only wants a paycheck.  Customer service is key, food is next, and specials are highly recommended.   Good luck!  My review will matter next time I am here."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game, with some great bar food! Hotshots has been around the Midwest for a while and I first went there in St Louis. They have a good franchise with a great management team, and the bartenders were always the best in town!

Enjoy,

            Luke"}
{"text":"Visit date 9/17/2017- Looking for a good sports bar? A neighborhood sports bar .. this is the perfect place. TV are everywhere!  Friendly staff and friendly customers! We meet someone every time we go there. They have GOOD  specials! The special we got was a bucket of domestic beer (like 6 bottles) for $12! They have college nights, poker and more. It's more then just a sports bar! 

The food:
My husband had the loaded fries (I forget the name), he loved it so much he ended up getting another one LOL! I had the artichoke and spinach wu tang (spell check), it was not the best, too me it was really greasy I could not really taste it. That will NOT STOP ME FROM going to this bar, next time I will just try thing different. I WILL SAY THIS: THEY NEED MORE VEGETARIAN AND OR VEGAN ITEMS ON THE MENU FOR PPL LIKE ME! 

They have games for children to play, the games are not free (Cheeky E Cheese NOT free either... I'm just saying) but at least you can bring your child(ren) and they will have something to do when they start to get bored while mom and dad are watching the game lol"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for what is advertised as \"$2.50 pints and 50¢ wings\" on Tuesdays. What they don't advertise is it is only domestics and then we were never told that in order to get 50 cent wings you can only order 5 or 10. My girlfriend and I both ordered 6 and were never informed it was 50 cent wings on 5 or 10 wings only until after I had received the check. Our waitress was very inattentive and somewhat rude. I felt as if it was a burden on the staff to get a beer or anything. 

It was ridiculous to me that we were never told about the stipulations of the specials even after ordering wings. The service here was honestly terrible and if it weren't for the dart boards I would most likely not return. Just felt as if we weren't worth the staffs time."}
{"text":"This place is literally only good for cheap drinks... Thats about it. Can't find any other winning quality and that's coming from someone who sees a positive in everything.....  Awkwardly big space for Concord, (No one lives here why are you the size of Dave and Buster's?) beyond awkward/clueless staff, bizarre owner, and BEYOND crappy food... I mean maybe for Concord's standards it's a solid C+, but in the real world this bar wouldn't last five minutes... I'd honestly be embarrassed to run a sad sports bar, but hey at least your pool squad keeps it alive... somewhat.. I guess.... Who knows! Anyways, Not everyone can be a Sports bar owner, so I'll just leave it at that! Try fixing your bathrooms and Tacos then maybe I'll give ya three stars...Yikes"}
{"text":"Place is a joke. And the bouncer (wanna be rapper Eminem) is a little weasel that thinks he's a hard ass as he's trying to show off for the waitresses that he works with. Waitresses were super nice and the place itself was fun to hang out in, but not worth the trouble of dealing with the incompetent manager and wanna be UFC bouncer guy. 

We went there three nights in a row without any problems then on the 3'rd night we found ourselves getting cut off from drinking and thrown out for laughing and joking as we had done the prior nights before without any bother...we weren't being rude or bothering anybody else...guess they just don't take kindly to anyone laughing out load or dancing a little. The manager was telling my friend that he had to leave cause he had to much to drink as the (white) bouncer was in my friends face calling him the \"N\" word and telling my friend to \"hit me\". As another costumer from a different table stood up and told the manager that the bouncer was in the wrong and there was no need for the way he was acting and using racial slurs to my friend. As the manager is telling us to come back the following night when his \"bouncer\" cools down, because he knew we did nothing wrong. 

We will be taking our business and our work groups and spending our money The Iron Thunder Saloon across the street from here on out, which is a shame because Hotshots is within closer walking distance of our hotel rooms and our work team of 20 to 50 is here for races and concerts at least 4 times throughout the year"}
{"text":"One year later, we saw a GroupOn and off we went.  Actually, we had meant to visit several times over the past year, but never go around to it.    So, 4 star.   One year has gone by and the place still looks brand new.  It is nice, with several TV's and it is clean.   They have several nightly specials and serve local craft beer.   That earned them star points.  Our server and the manager made sure we were taken care of.   

Starting with my wife, she had a thin crust Luau pizza, ham and pineapple.  Just said it was excellent and actually wanted to order another to go......   I had the GroupOn special 12 wings dry rub - six Franks Hot Sauce and six sweet hot (I think).  The wings were nice sized, about medium and cooked perfect.  They could have sprinkled more dry rub and next time I will ask for extra.   I hate paying extra for blue cheese, as it is .50 per serving, I can usually eat two or three -- one should be included, but that is just my pet peeve...............  I also ordered chili cheese tots, nacho cheese, good tasting chili over tots, actually pretty good.

So, Tuesdays is .50 wings and they have Goose Island IPA as the beer of the month for 
$3 bucks.   You cannot go wrong.   I am sure we will be back and I look forward to football season."}
{"text":"I've been going here once a week since Oct 2016.  I've posted reviews previously with promises from management that they were working on getting good servers.  Yesterday, I went to eat dinner here at approximately 5 pm.  Once we sat down, the manager informed me there was only one person working, but he would get her.  She was the bartender!  She did the best she could given the situation, and other servers in training showed up later.  The fact you have to beg for any service and for everything is now beyond excuses.  You have a giant Sports Bar with 50 TV's, darts, pool, games, a giant outdoor area with more games, and everything to make the Sports Bar the best it can be, but you cannot hire and more importantly keep help is a clear indication of how poorly this location is operated.  Also, the food preparation remains a probably as far as cleanliness.  I see cooks that don't wear plastic gloves and don't have hairnets.  They touch their nose, eyes, lips, face, clothing, counters, and they do not wash their hands before returning to food prep.  Worst of all, at the bottom of my Black Jack sandwich and fries was a black hair from the kitchen.  This has happened before and will continue as long as this business is so poorly managed.  Is it too much to expect a Server and clean food?  Apparently so at Hot Shots!  I've given this place 8 months and multiple complaints to right the ship, but it is worse than ever before.  Save yourself the pain, go to Hooters or The Tilted Kilt or The Fox and the Hound Sports Bar.  You'll avoid having the bartender wait on the entire business thus ensuring any chance at decent service, and the food sanitation and the hair and unclean handling of food!  The cooks, lack of sanitary food handling and preparing, and the pure unbridled nastiness are not worth the trouble!  Go anywhere but Hot Shots!"}
{"text":"First time here and the staff was amazing!!! Everyone went above and beyond to make us feel like we belong!!  We didn't order food while here (it was thanksgiving!!! No food needed) but we were given complimentary cheesecake and it was to die for!! Not to mention all food and drink prices were so cheap!!! This will be a regular place for us!!! Highly recommended to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Overall decent place. Advice for the owner you need new management staff. My friend had mold on his sandwich. Was really nice about It. Asked for something different. Staff was polite and got It corrected. At the end of my last visit to the establishment I asked why we were being charged for the sandwich that replaced his molded philly cheese steak. The manager stated \"well I exchanged It\" to which we explained to him... it's not the fact that you exchanged it that's expected.... But proper customer service would not charge the customer due to the fact that ITS A HUGE HEALTH HAZARD. Anyways I ended up paying the full cost for the food provided and I am happy to say I will not be giving this establishment anymore of my business due to the sarcastic tone..  and rude way that your management staff treated us... good luck in future endeavors \"wheels\" 

This place still sucks."}
{"text":"Food was ok, waitress needs a lot of training on how to serve a table. My boyfriend and I went and shot pool when finished eating not once but twice waitress came and asked all the gentlemen if they needed anything. I was never asked. So ladies if you want service go somewhere else that wants a females business."}
{"text":"Just a regular bar trying to make sex sell by making their girls wear tacky outfits. None of them usually match. It does get super busy on thursdays usually. They do have good alcohol specials but I just would never eat here. If you don't care what your employees wear then I just don't have much hopes for the food plus I know a girl who used to work here and said they microwave food. They allow their employees to smoke out in the patio, which grosses me out. I don't want my server smelling like an ash tray."}
{"text":"Went in & was excited about playing some pool.  There was virtually on one in the place.  No one came up to us.  No one asked us if we wanted anything and we were standing right next to the bar.  A bartender even looked me right in my face & didn't say ANYTHING.   We walked right out."}
{"text":"I had gone here a few times and when it's not busy the service is fine. But when I came for their College Night on Thursday night and their $1 beer special I waited at the bar for 30 minutes to be served and even when the line at the bar died down I still was not served. When I asked for a beer from the bartender and let her know I had been at the bar for a while she responded \"I don't care\" and ignored me. I have never received such terrible and disrespectful service at a bar before and I do not plan on patronizing it again. Go to Carolina Ale House or Twin Peaks instead if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Contrary to what the hours say they are open on Sunday and very willing to serve. Great staff and atmosphere here. Talk to Aaron and he will help you out no problem."}
{"text":"Yes, this is not the place to try out unless you want nasty food and trailer trash servers. This place won't be in business long. Not good for concord"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, should have gone to twin peaks instead. We just wanted a quick stop for some refueling and adult beverages. 

Got the \"Grand Slam\" were you pick 5. Super small portion wise. Although everything did have an okay flavor. (Don't recommend the Spicy Garlic for wings). 

I had mimosas since they were on special and my boyfriend had beer. 

All in all, it's an okay spot for a beverage but I would recommend eating here. There are better options in the area."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I only ordered wings and fries and they were decent, came out relatively quickly. Sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice, quirky but nice. I ordered a vodka cranberry and it was disgusting so the bartender made me another drink for free. I let her pick my drinks for the rest of the night, no idea what they were but they were delicious. FUN FACT they don't have Hennessy so don't go there for that. The waitresses were not cohesive in dress and that was strange. They also seemed to argue a lot. They have pool and other games to play. Overall this place has potential."}
{"text":"Good wings. Terrible wait staff. Nowhere to be found. Asked for condiments, came back 20 mins later dazed and confused...had no clue what we wanted or needed. I know they just opened so will give it time but they have a long road ahead of them, and given its race weekend...good luck!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar today and a number of folks that I've talked to have come in either because they know the bartender(s), or someone that does, or they were just traveling through. From what I can gather the ownership is new at owning a bar and/or restaurant. 

Noticed a couple issues while I was here:

1. Protein doesn't match the giant bun/serving
  -Had a burger last night - 2/5 stars - flavor, temperature, toppings and overall execution. The bun was a full half inch wider all the way around than the actual burger meat
  - Ordered \"Black Jack\" (second night, glutton for punishment I guess, but I wanted to give them a second chance) - 3/5 stars - great flavor; but again the toppings and bun were way large than chicken (waitress watched me cut off all the way around the chicken). 

Portions for sides are good and consistent with the prices. 

2. The best thing about this place is the bartenders and table staff. SUZY and LIZ are the definitely the greatest. Would give 5 stars to the bar. 

Hot shotz could be a good place in a year or so.  Needs to get the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for something different than our \"norm\" - This is really a huge, empty shelled bar with high top tables.  We started simple,  water with lemon oand the water was the absolute worst tap water ever. So we asked the server about the $4 martini special - she was absolutely clueless as to what a martini even was or that it came in a variety of flavors. 

The menu looked appetizing and because we were headed to a concert we figured we would keep it simple. 

Tried an order of Fried Pickles... which really should've been called fried pickle fries - and they were hot, crispy and delicious.

For our meal my friend and I decided to split sampler appetizer platter (wings, mini tacos, and toasted ravioli) and an order of nachos. 

The meal was Luke warm at best, the cheese on the nachos was liquid cheese (our fault, should've asked) which was congealed and cold, the chicken on nachos was cold, and the chips themselves tasted stale and old. 

The sampler... wings were cold, slightly undercooked, the mini tacos cool and microwaved? And the toasted ravioli  (mini) were also cool and microwaved? 

This was definitely bar food at it's worst, frozen precooked bar food, with jarred nacho cheese, salsa and jalapeños.  The cheap (but very expensive) nachos from a sporting event have more flavor and freshness than these did. The mini tacos and toasted ravioli you can purchase in a Sam's or Costco and microwave at home to better perfection. 

We waited nearly 20 minutes after our server brought us our food before she appeared again to ask how it was... when we told her it was cold, she stated well it's been awhile since you got it... Umm, it's been awhile since you made an appearance. She took away the cold nachos and about 5 minutes later the manager or similar came back with our barely eaten plate and asked if we \"really\" didn't want to eat it? And we stated a gf ain't everything was cold and oldish.. he reminded us that we've been served awhile, to which we reminded him that our server was absent awhile and the cheese was congealed upon arrival and chicken was ice cold. The ONLY good and fresh food we received was the fried pickles which we ordered about 10 minutes after our initial order (and it came out 1st?????)

We had purchased a Groupon for our meal so, for $9 it still wouldn't have been worth it, but our meal was comped fortunately.  The server also didn't want to give us change to leave her gratuity... 

So overall, if you want unique fried pickles... go for it it, if you're looking for knowledgeable staff and good bar food, skip it."}
{"text":"I am always trying to give places a shot even though I've heard rumors about this place and still went against them and decided to try.  The first time was nice, then I went another time and told my friends to come along and give it a chance. The experience was much different and probably will not make me want to return. First of all it's self seat but we sat at a table for 30 minutes and no one stopped by, people were standing at the door confused on whether or not to seat them selves and they were not greeted either. The servers walked around talked in corners and I even made eye contact with half of them and no one said anything. So I decide ok, whatever, I just go to the bar top. Bartender was decent, however when I ask for a receipt that shows I paid my balance, she continues to tell me multiple times she cannot give me a receipt showing I paid my bill. As a customer showing proof of payment should be respected, it's my money. She threw her hands up at me upset that she had to get the manager to print me a receipt. Even when she brought the receipt back she threw her hands up again and said with an attitude that \"that's just how our system works\" and stormed off. She still kept her tip, which she did not deserve and I still left with no good service. I will not return. I work in a restaurant and use a POS system similar to theirs and there's no way you're telling me you can't print me a receipt showing I paid and mind you they put a 50$ HOLD on my card which I am pretty upset about because that was not done previously when I was there before and was not told to me that it would be held. And to put the icing on the cake, when I leave out , the tables where I had first sat and never got service after 30 mins, had a section full with servers!!! Just horrible"}
{"text":"This place was very nice inside many big size tv's.
Few games big bar, service was quick. Atmosphere was laid back, food was your average bar food."}
{"text":"Haven't been able to try this place yet because the first time we came they said they didn't have high chairs so we had to leave. Or else my husband or myself would have to entertain our 11 month old. Wish they were more family friendly"}
{"text":"The first thing to notice about this place is the logo. I know it's not that important in the scheme of things, but you really have to wonder - who designed that thing? I am not a graphic artist, and my writing is atrocious, but I think I could have done better. To think that they are a chain (of sorts) makes you wonder. But we were out and about, and wanted to try something different, so we decided to give it a go.

As it happens, the old Quaker Steak actually wasn't a bad stop, so we decided we would try it again, even with the bad (new) logo. The next potential warning sign: It is dark inside. This could be good or it could be bad. Even in the late afternoon, when the sun is blazing, it is like a Las Vegas casino. The good news is that it's nice and cool inside, and the staff is friendly enough - though the place is giant, and there do not seem to be nearly enough tables to fill the place, so it was generally minutes between visits.

When we got out food - generally bar food, with extra Sriracha on about a quarter of the items - it was decent, and served as a solid dinner, with some to take home. Despite a hefty selection of items (mostly burgers, at least by number), they seem to focus a bit more on the bar portion of their name, but it works in a pinch."}
{"text":"Cool concept, but service is slow and food menu is limited on what seems to be a random schedule."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrid, I went in for dinner one night last week after work, this was my first time ever going to this particular bar. The service started out great our waitress was a girl named Allie or alie she was very knowledgeable and helped us look over the menu. We ended up ordering the mini tacos and  nachos. That was our first mistake the food was absolutely disgusting frozen bar food at its finest. The tacos had some sort of mystery meat in them and tasted microwaved. The nachos were cold and the cheese was runny and the chips were stale. We had only had water at this point so decided to order drinks. Second mistake the bartender obviously has no idea what she is doing, out drinks tasted like dirty sink water to the point we couldn't even finish them. We decided not to stay for dinner considering the food was awful and the drinks unbearable. I tried looking for a manager to let them know the situation but the only one there was appearantly the owner who was a complete excuse my language asshole to us and had an attitude the whole time speaking. Needless to say I will never recommend this place or ever be back. I doubt it will even last another year."}

Would probably come back for a game but not to eat"}
{"text":"Worst service- how about no service. Sat and waited for nearly an hour for someone to ask if we would like anything. Not a food or drink order was taken in s near empty restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place the other day as something different for lunch. This is more of a bar hangout than a place to eat. The lighting inside is very dim, to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu. Our table ordered many different things like salads, chicken wings and burger. Our first complaint came after sitting there for an hour and still not having our food. They were not even busy at this time. There might have been 10 tables sitting with at least 4 waitresses we saw. Once the food arrived no one at our table enjoyed the food. the salad was super bland, the chicken wings were soggy, and the burgers were over done. We will not be returning here again, it is even off our second chance list."}
{"text":"Hotshots is one of those bars that you see in the movies. There are a lot of motorcycles parked out front and it appears to give a \"rough\" vibe at night.

Seating is self-seating to ensure that you can get all good spot. There are a TON of televisions all around the place. Some were showing the game, while others had a trivia game you could play using apps that can be downloaded on your cell phone. Country music can be heard blasting over the system, so don't come here if you are seeking intimate conversation. 

The service was good. They wear revealing clothing but looked great so I couldn't complain. 

The food was bad bar food. My fries were extremely salty to where I couldn't finish them. I got the build your own burger... didn't know that I literally had to put my items on my burger and tasted like a Wendy's burger. 

This is definitely not my scene at all and I would never return. To end on a good note, they have some great beer specials during the week!"}
{"text":"Went in to eat there tonight, sat at bar to eat and have a beer. Sat for 10 minutes with no bartender asking if I needed anything. So I left to go at somewhere that would take my order. Crappy service"}
{"text":"Had the spicy garlic wings, they're on par with Buffalo Wild Wings. You buy them by the pound, 1 pound (10 wings) runs 8.99.
They have an insane amount of TVs in this place, you can pretty much catch any game you want to see. They have 4 pool tables & 5 dart boards. Good sports bar with cheap eats & lots of drink specials."}
{"text":"Great place with tons of TV's. Staff was friendly and food was out quick and hot. The wings and burgers are delicious! I don't drink but my bf does and he was more than happy with the drink specials they have. We've been there several times and we'll be returning."}
{"text":"This last trip was very disappointing.  We came in and sat at a table for ten minutes and couldn't get served.  There was a waitress that clearly was waiting on our table in her section.  She blew past us three times without even looking in our direction... and sadly so did the manager.  It's upsetting because we come in here on a regular basis, and it wasn't even busy.  Coming from someone who works in the industry... it is unacceptable.  After a long day on my feet serving others I had to finally go to the bar to serve myself.  Thanks for nothing."}
