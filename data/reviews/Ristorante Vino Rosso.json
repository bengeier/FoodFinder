{"text":"Outstanding. One of the best Italian restaurants in Montreal. Great service and food. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Ambiance is strange - far too bright light and extra pink string lights for some reason. It feels like a Starbucks that was converted into a restaurant. But a Starbucks from 2004, not a current Starbucks.   Food was completely unworthy of comment. At waiters recommendation I tried the spaghetti bolognese. Off the menu, but one of their best, he claimed. It was what I would expect from a fast-casual chain restaurant like Chili's."}
{"text":"Went here for my uncles 65th bday. All the food was very good from meat balls to calamari and then to our mains which included ahi tuna steaks, lamb chops and veggies."}
{"text":"I had my engagement party there and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome. The food was AMAZING and PLENTY. All our guests felt as if they were individually and personally taken care of as the staff delivered an excellent service making sure that all courses were served in a promptly manner and wine and soft drinks kept getting replenished throughout the night. Our guests and ourselves had an unforgettable night. The ambiance was DELIGHTFUL.  The owner of the restaurant was very welcoming and most importantly, the price was affordable and more than justifiable.  The QUANTITY,  QUALITY and TASTE of food delivered exceeded all standards. The privacy and coziness of their private room made our experience so unforgettable.  The customer service was TOP NOTCH! We appreciated the flexibility to decorate the room and have our own music to customize the event.  Vino Rosso is definitely my favorite restaurant in town. We had an amazingly pleasant experience! Definitely to be repeated for future parties. .."}
