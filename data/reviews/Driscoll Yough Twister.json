{"text":"After riding miles on the GAP, their ice cream was a welcome relief from the day. Fantastic ice cream."}
{"text":"I had terrible service. All of my food was cold. My fried pickles hardly looked like pickles the way they were mashed into the box. I got 3 burgers, all with ketchup on side. Asked for ketchup with my burgers and with my three orders of fries. Do you know how many they gave me? 3 PACKETS. I spent $20 and got the worst food of my life. Now this is all probably because my friend with me used to work there and he walked out on the job because of the poor treatment he got from who other than, the sam man that when I asked for more ketchup said \"sure buddy\" in a very passive aggressive tone. And then the dropped packet that didn't make it into the bag? He picked up and rudely just tossed it at me. I've never been so disrespected by someone I was giving money too and also tipping. I will
Be going back only to ask for my tip back."}
{"text":"Hello fellow yelper, this place offers terrible service. I have been there several times. The guy is very impatient when taking your order, and rude. They never give you napkins, and you always have to ask. They are small and cheap ones. I mean, come on, you see I have very small children. So why do I have to ask not once, but twice. Because they give you two for two kids"}
{"text":"How can you not like an ice cream stand?  This one is conveniently located right off the GAP rail trail 4 miles from West Newton in Sutersville. 

There is only outdoor seating and you order at the window. 

Their menu is extensive of both ice cream flavors and other bites to eat. I've only gotten ice cream and it hits the spot."}
{"text":"Stopped here for ice cream while bike riding on the GAP trail.  I got a small soft serve vanilla cone. I mention the size because it was huge - the size of a large. Now, most people might be happy with a large for the price of a small but not me. I just want a little something to enjoy not something to binge on that I will regret later. It also was too soft, melting immediately."}
{"text":"Ice cream is good, prices aren't bad but service is awful! Always short staffed! Always waiting forever to get order! By the time everyone gets there ice cream it's melted! All is good but service could be better!"}
