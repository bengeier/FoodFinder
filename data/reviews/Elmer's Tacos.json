{"text":"Excellent food across the board!! Have not been disappointed yet. Fry bread is the beast in town!"}
{"text":"If there was one eatery to remind me of high school it's Elmer's tacos! Awesome food but the taco sauce is where they shine! Also can't beat $1 tacos!"}
{"text":"Best Bean & Cheese Burrito you will ever eat. I have been going to Elmer's since high school, and just recently had them cater my wedding luncheon. I am so glad I did. Everything was perfect and delicious, and just what I have come to expect from Elmer's. Lisa was amazing to work with, and even worked with me through personal health problems and family tragedy. I love love love Elmer's Tacos."}
{"text":"Best mexican food ever been coming here since I was a kid it's a must try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best breakfast burritos in town. We live on Tempe and eat here at least once a week.  If we want breakfast burritos we go here. The other food is great too."}
{"text":"1st time visiting. I was looking for good burrito early in Saturday in Chandler. The spicy chicken burrito was good, spicy but not over spicy. Got fast serve and good price.  I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"the food is soo good.i love elmers"}
{"text":"I placed an order in the past to go. When I carried it home the 24oz salsa and (was supposed to be 24 oz rice) the 24 oz beans leaked all over even on the receipt. I called and spoke with the manager a gentleman. He apologized ad stated there were some new employees. He asked for the receipt number which is the employee number and it was 3510. He took my first and last name along with my phone number. He told me the salsa and rice would be credited. I placed the same to go order today adding in the credited rice and salsa. The girl on the phone let out a sigh. When I walked in to pick up the order, I was told someone else with my same name and phone number...along with the receipt picked it up. SHOCKED! The original receipt had salsa on it from the spill in the vehicle. I hope their customer service improves and it begins with honesty next time."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. however, when I sat inside (I normally order to go) , I saw a cockroach climbing up the wall. I grabbed my food and ran out. I was so disgusted"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for their salsa at Elmer's. It just cant be tomatoes, onions and  cilantro, there has to be some \"secret\" love they put in it.  Tacos are to die for."}
{"text":"This place opened as a taco stand when my mom was in high school! Now 40 years later they still serve the best burritos you could hope to find. The red sauce is to die for, and you won't ever find better green chile than Elmer's. Still family owned & insanely affordable. We even freeze burros & send the them out of town to family who CRAVES it!"}
{"text":"What's going on with the food here? Is there new owners? The food seems to be getting less tasty each time I come here. The beef for the green burrito is not the same, the cheese (white) is horriible. Taste like cafeteria or hospital food. I hope the owner didn't sell and now some cheap owner are buying food now. I used to give this place a 5 star and now I would have to grade them as a 1 star until they improve the quality of there food."}
{"text":"A chandler institution, the food is great, service is awesome. Great place to run into people you haven't seen in years (if you grew up here). If you didn't we will accept you anyways."}
{"text":"My family and I love Elmer's food - it's delish!!!  Big caveat is that they can't seem to get our orders correct.  We've been there three times in the last six months, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and the last for dinner.  The got our order correct one of three times.  The last time they got everything right on the receipt, however, the actual order was all screwed up.  My bad for not checking before I left with the to-go order but it was a ton of food and not marked on the styrofoam containers.  Trust but verify, I guess.  Really sad considering the tastiness of their food.  Awesome place if they get your order correct.  The order they got correct was breakfast and I was one of two people there which is likely why they got it right."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in chandlar! Great prices and always amazing food! Breakfast is my favorite here!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet what the hell are you waiting for!!!  I'm addicted to this place the carne asada burro is outstanding top notch try it. Do it do it"}
{"text":"Split decision   I really enjoyed the food, but my wife wasn't thrilled.  If you're looking for fine dining, don't stop here.  Keep on driving.  BUT if you're a fan of a simple Mexican food joint, like I am...  You're in for a treat.  Good cheap Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos! Defiantly will be coming here more :) good was hot when I got it. Rare to find such an awesome place!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the place is a hole in the wall. Typical environment for places with good food. Probably more suited for a quick lunch than a dinner. No alcohol. I got the two enchilada's and was a little surprised when I could not choose to get a chicken and a beef..so the menu is pretty rigid. Overall - the food was delicious and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Customer service skills are horrible the woman was very rude when my son walked in behind me she mentioned to another employee that he was wasting money because he held the door open for another customer I watched her take a chip and some cheese with her bare hands out of the portioned cheese for the strips and eat it over the food I have been going here for twenty years but after the poor customer service I will not return also the past couple times the food is burnt"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl. Great burritos, tacos, and strips.  The rice and beans are good too."}
{"text":"I started going to Elmer's when I was in high school.  Back then, it was a stand over on the corner of Erie & AZ, where the oil change place is now.  It's a couple (okay a few ... okay MANY) years later, and I'm still going there.  I will admit that I have an extra-special affinity for Elmer because he kept my little sister fed in high school \"on account\" when she spent her lunch money on various and sundry pharmaceuticals.  He's a good guy, and his little taco stand is an institution.  I used to stop for breakfast and have a butter tortilla with sauce, which was just that - a simple flour tortilla warmed up, buttered, spread liberally with Elmer's killer sauce and folded in fourths.  It's making me hungry just writing about it!  His offerings are pure comfort food for me (as well as a lot of other Chandler residents!).  Elmer's serves solid, inexpensive \"kitchen\" Mexican.  It's way casual.  You queue up in line (along with a couple of teenagers, a sunburned 20-something with wet hair and a t-shirt over her bathing suit, a city worker, and a mom with a couple of toddlers) place your order, pay, then move aside and wait for your food.  Indoor seating consists of Formica booths, and outside there are some concrete patio tables with umbrellas.  While you're waiting, you can peruse the bounced checks posted around the register to see if you know any deadbeats, or read the thank you notes from elementary school tours or newspaper articles about Elmer and his restaurant.  Unless you have infinite patience and fortitude, don't go at lunchtime during the school year.  I love kids - I even made a couple of my very own - but the noise level reaches levels above extreme.  That being said, the lunchtime experience can be very enlightening - high school kids today are a little different from high school kids when I was that age (maybe it's all the hormones in our beef?).  =)  The menu is posted on the wall behind the register, and embraces the usual cast of characters of burritos, tacos, beans, etc.  There are burgers, too, and they're great!  Sodas come in large, extra-large and bring a wheelbarrow to carry.  There's also horchata and some aqua frescas.    All of Elmer's burritos are good - big, soft flour tortillas wrapped around savory bits of spicy meat and creamy smooth beans.  Bring plenty of napkins, a blowout is guaranteed with an Elmer's burro.  His cheese enchiladas are equally good; corn tortillas wrapped around melty cheese, covered with a handful of crispy raw onion and rich, flavorful enchilada sauce.  But nothing on the menu holds a candle to Elmer's strips.  They are the most important thing to order.  They're long rectangular strips of corn tortilla, fried to crispy goodness, and served with confetti (yellow and white) cheese.  Get a large with extra cheese and extra sauce, cheese on the side.  This dish is neither complicated nor gourmet, but it is tasty, satisfying and comforting.  Pair it with a bean and cheese with sauce and a large Pepsi, and you've just ordered the meal that thousands of Chandler High School students have treasured for more than 25 years.  If you want to really indulge, have them deep-fry the burrito.  The combination of greasy, fried tortilla \"skin,\" bubbling hot beans and cheese and that signature sauce is Nirvana.  If you're looking for some chi-chi Mexican food with blue corn and jalapeno foam, Elmer's is not the place for you.  If you want comforting food that will more than fill your gut yet not empty your wallet, Elmer's food will fit the bill."}
{"text":"The older lady at the counter always remembers my daughter and makes her feel special every time we have some in. The food is absolutely fabulous and they have great prices.   The only reason I didn't give them the full 5 stars is that it is sometimes hard to find a clean table and it gets a little hot inside.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend this place (and have) to everyone. Great little hole-in-the-wall place with a real family friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE best bean burrito of all time is here. From a native az gal to you, come here and u won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Just had some unreal chicken taquitos with rice and beans.  I only live a like a block away so yah have eaten there a few times and love it everytime!  The machaca green chile burrito is a fav and so are the taquitos now..."}
{"text":"The service was ok but the food was horrible I ordered 2 chicken tacos one fish taco and steak burrito the chicken tacos were so small it was half my hand for 225 I can do better than that buying taco stuff from frys the steak inside the burrito was burned and every bite was crunchy the fish taco was the best t hing on the menu it was made fresh and hot everything else was cold I would not recommend this place to anyone it's not worth the money nor the time cook at home"}
{"text":"I always come back to Elmer's Tacos. It's easily the best Mexican (although being from Dallas, I'd call it more Tex-Mex) I've had in Arizona. The food is delicious, and adding that two people can eat well for under $20, the price is perfect."}
{"text":"My family and I ate lunch here for the first and last time. The beans were greasy and the enchiladas were like soup. The burros were alright but I've had much better. I hope that the AC was broken and that it's not always that hot inside. The service was pretty bad to, really slow. I'm giving them one star because the rice was good. I'd say find someplace else to eat."}
{"text":"I discovered Elmer's a few months ago and fell in love with their Carne asada tacos and have been back many times for them. This year, I suggested our company used them for our Christmas luncheon and what we received was excellent. The customer service in placing the order was great and we were able to get plenty of food for our 60+ employees. The staff is extremely professional and friendly and set everything up for us before wishing us a happy lunch. The food was fresh, delicious, and very filling. Everyone found a new restaurant today! Thank you to Elmer's for catering our event and being such a pleasure to work with. Highly recommended for any meal or any large event. Elmer's is great!"}
{"text":"Forget the negative Nancy's......this place is awesome. It's family owned, and after you've been in a few times they remember your name! The food is great, the lines are long at lunch and in the evening. We hit this place up usually on Friday nights after work and an occasional lunch mid week. It's authentic Mexican food. Yeah, it's not a \"new\" building, yeah, it's in the older part of downtown Chandler, but the food and service are great. The Strips & Beans and Red Chili Burros are my favorite. They have mini burros for $1.75, two of them and I'm stuffed. I found this place on accident 10 years ago, and have been enjoying ever since."}
{"text":"Made from scratch! Need I say more? Ok fine I will.. The employees there are out of this world friendly!!  I feel sorry for them though it feels like you are on the sun when you are inside. They need to look at that issue!"}
{"text":"Love Elmer's so much.  Was introduced to it by my girlfriend and can't believe I've never heard of it before then.  The simple bean and cheese burrito is probably my favorite.  They inject it with red sauce and it is sooo good.  Also always get an order of strips whenever I go and they're deceptively delicious...who knew dumping a pound of cold cheese and hot sauce on to chips would be good?  I've also had the tacos al pastor and they are very good.  Not as good as the ones you'll find in Mexico (not enough fat), but still very good."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I have been thinking about going back for chili relleno's since Tuesday. It's a hole in the wall, but those usually are the best. it's far from fancy and it's 100 times better than Serrano's and Abuelo's and a heck of a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"HOW???? have I driven by Elmer's for YEARS, ignored the recommendations from my Mexican foodie friends and not eaten here before?  beans, tamales, fresh tortillas, green burro, carne asada...HEAVENLY!  Love you Elmer's!  See you later Guedo's!"}
{"text":"I have always had good food and service here. If you are craving mexican and are in Chandler give it a try."}
{"text":"Drunk or hung over this is the spot for you ;) don't go for the atmosphere or service. You will wait in line to place your order at a counter. But if you need greasy Mexican food your in luck. I am a fan while intoxicated however I could live without the  heartburn and hangover lol. Guess I will never learn..."}
{"text":"Good place for beens, the service was just okay. Will come again and try something else."}
{"text":"I like this place...A LOT. If the beans taste like they were made with lard, I like it. ha.  Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Place was hoppin.  Ordered a taco, tostada and some rice. Pretty damn amazing.  Service was fast. Only downfall, the person in front of me ordered 50 some tacos and that made my wait for food a little long.  Order to go so you can get the hot sauce packets! I will be back....with others......"}
{"text":"My parents ate here in high school and I was raised on elmers as a kid. I have been eating elmers for 30 years now and have never had the poor kind of quality of food as tonight. We ordered strips, deep fried bean and cheese burrito with sauce and their new shrimp fajitas.  The sauce tasted horrible, like it was watered down and flavorless. There's no way that is the same recipe of the sauce of the past. That left us with nothing but cheese and chips. So there goes the strips. We had about ten packets of sauce and they all tested horrible. I'm not sure what happened to the bean burrito. I love these burritos with sauce but they used that same horrible batch of sauce in my burrito. The beans were burned. Check out my pictures. The shrimp fajitas had literally three popcorn size shrimp and the vegtables were mostly onions. Horrible. They advertise this in posters in the restaurant so my dad decided to try it. Big mistake! I tried calling the place several times but there was no answer. They must have a new cook or something but it sure ruined dinner. I will return once my order is replaced and when they announce the arrival of the old cook or at least one with experience."}
{"text":"Caught them before closing time, being generous with 2 stars regardless the tacos were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Elmer's has always been a favorite stop for our visits to Arizona. We've been going there for years. On this trip we were very disappointed with the apparent changes. Maybe there is a new owner? The food quality has taken a dive. It was overly greasy and poorly prepared. Why did they have to change? I guess we'll have to cross Elmer's off our list and it pains me to do so. Also, no more tamarindo and jamaica."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a delicious lunch!  I love Mexican food even more now that I went to Elmer's on AZ Ave. in downtown Chandler.  There was a counter where you ordered.  The staff was friendly.  I ordered 2 mini burritos; a spicy green chili beef and a mini bean and cheese burrito with a side of rice.  You can dine in or take your food to go.         It seems to be the hotspot for high school students.  The building is older but I admired the realistic mural paintings of cultural objects on the inside.  There is a beautiful mural on the outside of the restaurant as well.  The place is small with 6 booths and 2, four chaired tables.  The leather on the booth seats was well worn. The restaurant was filled with nice cool air.  In the background you can hear Mexican music playing softly over the speaker system.        It only took 4 minutes before my number was called to pick up my food.  The word \"mini\" was misleading because the burritos covered the whole paper plate!  Steam rolled out of the burritos when you bit into them. A warm puff of steam emerged from the bowl of rice.  The green chili beef burrito was unbelievably juicy with a green chili kick wrapped in a soft, fresh tortilla.  I HIGHLY recommend this tasty treat!  The bean and cheese burrito was good, but just could not compare to the green chili burrito.  The rice was flavorful.  Just a side a note, you do not get free soda refills, which was an issue when my mouth was on fire from the spicy green chili burrito!  Overall, I highly recommend eating at Elmer's for some very tasty authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 15 years and never gets old. Everything is great but I recommend the bean and cheese with sauce and add rice. Nobody makes a better bean and cheese burrito than Elmers."}
{"text":"One of the original grimy and dirty psuedo-mex sort of places - and I mean \"grimy and dirty\" in the best way possible. It's not texmex, but not really real mexican food. Neither the menu choice nor the food itself are particularly good, but if you're looking for a good, say, bean and cheese burrito, this is a solid choice. And they serve Pepsi products, always a bonus for those of who like Dew. If you're looking for something a bit nicer, Guedo's is a block south and is significantly nicer to sit down and eat at. They also have much better food and a bar - but are almost double the price. I may have a positive bias for this place, considering the many times I ate there during my HS days, but any mexican food fan in Chandler needs to eat here at least once."}
{"text":"Family favorite.The sauce is like nothing else! LOVE the bean and cheese burritos. Family comes every time they are in town. Bring guests here often and everyone is happy. Plus Elmer is so nice, love when we get to see him!"}
{"text":"They have the best food at the best prices! They are so nice here! Today she gave me a free order of chips and let time a free drink! Here a place that really cares about their customers"}
{"text":"I repeated so so many times crunchy beef taco. Got soft tacos instead and both rice and beans were COLD. Such a waste of a drive. SO MAD."}
{"text":"Elmer's Tacos joint has good Mexican food, but does not come close to being the best around the area. While the food does carry that authentic taste, quite a few dishes are...well, weird tasting.  I would recommend the hard shelled tacos. You can never go wrong with tacos, and for the most part this is the pretty tasty.  There are some other worthy Mexican food places to try when in Chandler, but Elmers is worth it if looking for a quick Mexi-food fix."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. The food has always been amazingly good except for a few instances when the carne asada has been over cooked. The food is a little smaller portioned compared to the other fast Mexican food and their friendliness is a bit of a coin toss. I always go back for those mini chimis and chorizo though."}
{"text":"The cashier was rude, snippy and the food was cold on the inside. Suppose to be melted cheese for enchiladas, nothing like biting into cold unmelted chesse. Indian tacos were over fried and tasted like oil. The rice was great.  Never ever going to recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch today and the food was great! I didn't have a drink so I can't vouch for the soda. I realize others have said it isn't the best but I have no complaints. I like the front patio though... the inside was a little muggy."}
{"text":"Really good, affordable food.Resturant is kinda small and gets really packed during the lunch hours"}
{"text":"i find the food too greasy. The salsa covers the blandness of the food.  Never go here while the high school across the street is out for lunch, its a ZOO!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco joint in Chandler closed down a while back so earlier this week I gave Elmer's a try. I was not impressed. I ordered shredded beef crispy corn tortilla tacos and they were fried so long the meat was hard. I had a large fountain drink and upon ordering saw that they charge $1 each for refills! (Wow) Chips and salsa while you wait are not complimentary either. I ordered a bean chimi with a side of guacamole to go, and although the chimi was priced OK at $4, a tiny (I mean teeny tiny) condiment cup of guacamole was $1.50. It just wasn't a good experience and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love my Elmers!! Their Mini Chimi's are awesome...the fact they come with probably the best taco EVER -- just tops it off. No matter what we get we LOVE Elmers. We drive over 8 miles to go there."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the mini green chile burrito it was okay I would probably have it again. Had the carne asada tacos it was very disappointing the meat was to overcooked and dried. The salsa did not impress me, tomato based salsa not many options here."}
{"text":"I have been on a taco binge for the last few weeks, and this was the second place, I tried, at first I was going to give it a 2 stars but base on all the other places, I changed my mind. The tacos are a little over priced, but I find that they are about average for this area. I had the carne asada and marinated pork and I guess it was a regular beef taco. One was a hard shell which I don't care for. If you want that then go to taco bell or get the tostada which is the original hard shell. The pork was by far the best of the three, the other was okay. Also had the horchata there and seems okay. I think a lot of people over rate this place due to its history or its affiliation with Chandler High School. All in all it was okay to me, nothing to come back or out of my way to."}
{"text":"I don't see the big deal with this place. The \"strips\" are frickin chips with shredded cheese. The hot sauce was pretty good though. Carne asada burrito was okay, but nothing outstanding. I know this place has a huge following, but I don't think I'll be going here again."}
{"text":"So first off we came here after my husband heard Rick Demicco say this place had the best tacos in Chandler. Okay , I wouldn't go that far. First the tacos were good but not the best. Also usually a taco place has salsas, jalapeños and limes free and available. Here they didn't have limes, jalapeños , and they charge for the green salsa. The only salsa that's free is the red one , that tastes like it came out of a can. The restaurant was not very clean either.   Listen, hispanics know good tacos and let me tell I didn't even see one there. I wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment.  By the way the staff acted like their doing you a favor taking your order :/"}
{"text":"Decided to come here because of the reviews. Way overhyped. Nothing special had better at the Berto's. Salsa no flavor and tortillas on the tacos could use a slight fry."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I was so happy I tried this new place with my family. I really loved the steak taco dinner!"}
{"text":"The son and I tried Elmer's last night for the first time.  Figured he could see what the place is about so he knows where he can dash to for lunch from CHS.  He got the Asada burrito which he said tasted good.   I got the green beef hot burrito.  It was tasty, but very messy.  I had to grab a fork and knife to finish.  They have a pretty decent sized menu.  Prices are dirt cheap.   Hands down they beat Guedo's because they offer chips and salsa and take debit cards.  Food, prices and counter help is better at Elmer's too.  Not the cleanest of places.  Definite hole in the wall.  The smooshed food on the floor by our table kinda got to me."}
{"text":"Sometimes the wait is a little long, but always worth it.  I actually think the food has gotten better recently.  It has always been good.  They rarely mess up an order.  I can't remember them ever messing up our order.  Probably ate here over 100 times, since high school.  Wish it was closer, but we still go out of our way to eat there!"}
{"text":"Always awesome to visit this place when I am in town. The renovations look good and the food is awesome. The house sauce is my favorite."}
{"text":"Dear Chandler, Elmer's tacos is s MUST to visit if you're a native to the area. Across from Chandler High, you'll find the best bean burritos and strips and salsa in Chandler. On Saturdays, watch out, you'll be in a line-it's SO good!"}
{"text":"Bean and cheese, strips, and carbonation in the Pepsi is excellent. 5/5 stars. Parking gets 3/5 stars, there aren't a lot of spaces. Location 4/5 stars because you have to turn in/out from parking lot to and from a busy road, but it's still worth it. Seating 3/5 stars because when it gets busy there isn't a ton of area, but they do have outdoor seating...unfortunately there tends to be flies outside. Good service 5/5. Very busy in the afternoons."}
{"text":"I'm one of THOSE people... I absolutely despise cilantro... I believe man found a weed in the ground and accidentally ate it, and hence we have cilantro.  That said..  Fish taco:  grilled fish, not deep fried.  Way OD on the salt (I swear I was crunching on salt flakes) but let's say that's a fluke and order it again.  No cilantro sighting.  Red burro + mini green burro:  liked the mini burro concept, while BF got the full sized.  BF is a red burro fiend and this makes it into this Top 5.  My mini green was passed to him, as there is an embedded cilantro taste... to be fair the meat was tender and juicy (not over cooked meat til it's dry and redunked in liquid).   Rice & beans:  disturbing to see orange oil pool around the beans.  Flavors of either did not impress.  Really liked the tortillas, warm with just the right amt of chew."}
{"text":"Mom and I popped in for a quick snack - got two mini burros - green chicken and machaca beef. Excellent!!!! The green chicken had a very nice kick to it, the machaca was tender and lean. Absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went in to pick up lunch. I ordered the bean & cheese burrito (per Yelpers recommendation). It took a LONG time for my order to be ready, next time I will definitely call ahead. The price was awesome and the food was really good.  I anxious to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"We heard about Elmers, and decided to pass a few of our favorite dives to check it out. We will be back. The green chilli beef is off the hook! Friendly people, great food. Not a fancy joint, but if you are looking to please your mouth, this is it."}
{"text":"To begin with, I am surprised by the number of reviews that rag on the appearance of the building.  This is a fast food Mexican restaurant, it is not supposed to be fine dining with white linen, silver and china, come on people...I actual found Elmer's to be rather upscale for most fast food Mexican restaurants and if I were reviewing  them simply on the building, they would get 4 stars. And hey, don't forget the spacious parking lot.    This was my first Elmer's experience and I arrived in mid morning so I wasn't competing with a large crowd of high schoolers at the counter, but there was still a steady stream of customers.  I found the inside to be clean with more than ample seating.  I would expect a large portion of their business to also be takeout as was my case.  On this particular morning there was a great deal of interest by the staff to go outside and see someone's (perhaps an employee's) Great Dane, once they satisfied that experience, they were able to take my order and get back to the food business.   I like to judge a restaurant of this type by their breakfast burritos.  I'm looking for: quality, quantity, and price.  I am always taken back anytime  you have to pay extra for cheese on Mexican food or any food for that matter (an extra $.75).  I guess if you are happy with a tortilla, eggs and the choice of one, either meat,  beans or potatoes, then the price of $3.50 is fine.  But if you would perhaps like to have cheese and beans also on your breakfast burrito or more likely cheese and potatoes, that will be another $.75 for the cheese and $.50 for the potatoes which now takes you to $4.75 which is where the quantity comes in.  It's not a particularly large burrito for nearly $5.00.  As for quality, the breakfast burrito was good. No complaints with quality of the food.   I agree with other Yelpers  that Elmer's has great red sauce.  I also really like their (insert images of \"Twilight\") style of packaging of their red sauce.  It you've eaten here before you will know what I mean, if not, when you do try Elmer's you will then know what I mean.  It works great for adding the sauce to your burrito while you are eating and driving.  Did I say that...I mean sitting on the couch adding hot sauce to your breakfast burrito  while flipping through the channels on the TV.  And now for what appears by most of the Elmer's Yelpers to be the Holy Grail of Elmer's...the bean and cheese burrito...ehhh...not too impressed.  I like my beans fully mashed but that is just me."}
{"text":"Having gone to chandler high, Elmer's was always a lunch destination.  Bean and cheese burrito and strips are always delicious.  But those mini chimi's!!!!  Mmmmm!!!  Those are my favorite.  I loved this place then, and I love it still 13 years later."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to order in some Mexican food!  I have tried a lot of the menu items and have been pleased with every single one.   Both Green & Red Chili burritos are so tasty as well as their Carne Asada and Pastor Burros. Great size and portion, tender beef or pork, and really great prices.  I'm also a fan of the taco salad which is a great value for the amount of food you get. Mini chimi's are the bomb too, as well as the crispy beef tacos. And their homemade hot sauce?? I could drink it by the glass lol.  For solid, no frills Mexican at awesome prices - Elmer's is my go to."}
{"text":"I'm getting really tired of going to restaurants and being treated like dirt.    I placed my order and upon hearing the price thought it seemed high.  I paid first and after getting the receipt I discovered they charged me for a large burrito.  I told the cashier what I actually ordered - a mini burrito-  and instead of being apologetic, she was visibly upset.  Upon getting all of my food from the cashier, she angrily said, \"they gave you a whole burrito instead.\"  She wouldn't even look at me and quickly left.  I understand that this restaurant deals with a lot of high school kids.  Well lady, you can treat them like that- you don't treat adults in such a rude manner.  Crossed off the list for good.  Oh and the food?  The pastor taco had chunks of fat in it and the beef taco was tiny.  The burrito was not very good either.  A hidden gem?  Nonsense!"}
{"text":"Yuck! We had high hopes but was very disappointed. The cheese enchilada was still raw, the cheese not melted. The beans had a layer of grease so thick, it was disgusting. And the Taco shells had been par cooked to long in advance. They were cold and soggy. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Went here a few times during high school  (who didnt), it is very good but nothing super special about it."}
{"text":"Quality authentic Mexican-Sonoran food close to home. First time in 5 years I've found a tasty place to go. Very reasonable prices and accommodating staff! Would absolutely come again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 13 years now and just recently the service has Been horrible , rude lady taking orders today was mean and nasty, (she was wearing glasses inside) and because of her I'm never spending my money here again, foods gone down hill lately too"}
{"text":"Elmers is great mexican made old style.  it's a little place and not very pretty but the food is the so so so good and the beans are the best I have ever had. go to elmers."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! This is a great little hole in the wall spot for some authentic Mexican (and American ) food.  Since this place is across the street from Chandler High expect to see High School students lounging around the site. I had the bean and cheese burrito with the famous \"red sauce\" and a beef taco. Typically, I would not eat a bean and cheese burrito because I am a diehard carnivore, but this little log had some soul! The burrito was a little on the messy side but what decent burrito isn't. I really liked that the burrito was toasted- it raises the flavor to the next level. The taco was very neat. Shell crunchy, meat moist with lettuce and cheese and of course I added the red sauce! I can't wait to go back and try other items. Too bad this place does not have a drive through."}
{"text":"Love Elmers! Have been going here since high school. It's a little taco shop right across from Chandler High and anyone who ever attended that school knows what Elmer's is. I recommend their double decker taco and their bean burrito."}
{"text":"I love Elmer's. They're so friendly and food is great. I always order the \"red & bean\" burrito it's not on the menu. But its delish!! It's beans with their special red sauce and a bunch of shredded beef. It's so flavorful and tender. The strips are also very good. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love this place! However the only thing I've ever gotten from here is their bean and cheese burrito, and a taco. The taco wasn't the best, but their beans are amazing. I love the service here too, they are always friendly."}
{"text":"1st off, the food I did eat was...ok. Not the best but not bad.  The real reason for the bad review is that a 1/4 of the way into my bean and cheese burrito was a long blond hair!!! 2 stars bc they have plenty of vegetarian options I won't bother describing or rating any of the other food I ate before the nasty hair was found."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! First time I went in I ordered tacos and the second time I ordered taquitos. Both times were sooo good! I can't wait to go back. I don't know how I didn't know of this place sooner. I am hoping I can try everything on the menu. They even have \"American\" food and you'd think the staff would be grumpy based on the non stop hustle but they are super nice and don't rush you at all. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I have to say that it's the best taco shop I've ever been to. I recommend the strips and anything Machaca with red sauce. The green is actually spicier here lol. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Elmer's is a randomly delicious hole-in-the-wall Mexican food spot that has been in downtown Chandler for roughly one million years.   My family started going to Elmer's when we moved to Chandler from Milwaukee, Wisconsin about 20 years ago. I can safely say that it was my first experience of more \"authentic\" Mexican food, as the stuff we had in the Midwest seemed to have been made by people who had ONLY seen pictures of Mexican food, but had not actually tasted the real thing. (the Mexican restaurant of choice in WI during my childhood was called, unironically and naively, Chi-Chis... no joke)   That said, I have great memories of this place! It is tiny, tucked into a small strip immediately opposite Chandler high school. There is a parking lot in the back that can be difficult to navigate when it is crowded. There is a decent patio, however I never end up sitting out there as the tables and benches are made of concrete, which feels like lava during the hotter 7 months of the year. The interior is not particularly special, but also has not changed a bit since I first visited; the furniture looks like it may have been inherited from a McDonalds or other fast food restaurant from the 80s, the floors are linoleum (I think? Maybe tile), and there are fairly cheesy murals of cartoony animals throughout. There is a wrought iron waist-high fence that indicates where to form a line, and a counter where the orders are taken. The menu is done in old-school marquis style, with plastic letters attached to the backing. If you're looking for something in particular, be sure to look at ALL of the menu boards - they have a large menu that stretches all the way behind the long counter, above the kitchen, it is not very well lit, and it is easy to miss something if you only pay attention to the boards that are immediately in front of you and easy to see.   I have a few \"go to\" items - the Strips are oddly yummy... tortilla strips (in lieu of chips) topped with unmelted shredded cheese. Weird, right? They're crazy salty and for some reason, in the hot Chandler weather, the cool cheese with the crunchy chips usually hits the spot. Adding a dab of their hot sauce here and there (also very salty) adds a little heat and flavor when needed. The Cheesy Beef Tortilla is basically the one thing that I order here - not because other stuff isn't good, but because the Cheesy Beef Tortilla is just THAT good. It is a large tortilla (probably about 12\" in diameter) filled with Green Machaca Shredded Beef, lots of cheese, tomatoes, and onions, then broiled. It is folded first in half, then in quarters and is usually a \"knife and fork\" sort of thing. In theory it is like a quesadilla, but in practice it is softer, fuller of delicious stuff, and just tastier overall. They do a good job with their Machaca - very flavorful, good meat (not too fatty, which is a problem I often find with shredded beef in Mexican food)   I've also tried tacos, fry bread, burritos, etc - all good, at least standard if not better than most.   Pricing is reasonable in my book. On a recent visit we got a Cheesy Beef Tortilla, Two Tacos, Two Drinks, and an order of Strips for around $12.   The line/order/wait scenario is a bit of a pain sometimes - I visited on a weekend midafternoon and there were one or two people in front of me in line, which was not bad. However, once you order, you have to wait to hear your number called and pick up your food from the end of the counter. I think we probably waited upwards of 15 minutes for our food to be ready, and it was difficult to entertain the baby while also listening attentively for my number. I think they could definitely improve by creating a table-number setup for dine-in orders so that guests could take a seat, snack on their strips, etc while waiting for their food.   The staff are pretty nice - not overwhelmingly friendly but they made things easy and had kind demeanors."}
{"text":"chips, cold cheese, and red salsa? I would have never thought! it is good.  My usual order is the burrito pastor. Its pretty good but I'm usually there for the chips!"}
{"text":"Nondescript place serving great bean & cheese burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"I had the pastor burrito and a beef taco. The taco was average and the burrito was below average. The pork had more fat in it than it should have. The service was decent though. I would go back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and ordered carne asada tacos. The meat was poor in quality. I tried two different salsas and neither were good. The onions don't taste fresh either. There's nothing here for me to come back to."}
{"text":"Elmer, I love you.  I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good.   If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.  Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.  And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids.   I love you Elmer. I always will."}
{"text":"The bean and cheese burros are delicioso! If u don't kno now ya kno.... And the strips don't seem like much but pretty good stuff. It's just chips, shredded cheese, and sauce but it works. It's very clean and always busy. Right across from Chandler High you can't miss it. I gave the 4 frijoles..."}
{"text":"A real tradition and for good reason. Wonderful Mexican food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Got the bean burrito and strips per the recommendation of other yelpers. The burro wasn't bad but also nothing special. The strips... are you kidding? Folks, this is just tortilla chips with shredded cheese. The cheese is not even melted and falls off the chips as you eat them. If you actually wanted to eat this, just go to the grocery store and get the supplies. The taco sauce is about like tomato soup and is served in a sealed plastic bag."}
{"text":"Do you love Chile Rellenos?  This place has the real deal and they are very inexpensive.  I had their combo 15 plate that also includes beans (awesome) and rice (awesome) and enchiladas (good, but needed a little onion).   Be sure and ask for some salsa for your table - it is in a squeeze bottle and I pretty much used up the entire bottle because it is so tasty!  Lunch hour during school days is very busy so if you come at lunch when school is in session, plan on standing in line."}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burrito ever! Also love the chicken and beef tacos. Super good taco shop! Best red sauce and strips!"}
{"text":"You don't grow up in Chandler without trying Elmer's!!  Its a total dive and a Chandler High favorite for lunch.  They have the best bean & cheese burros (order it \"with sauce\").  I like the strips & cheese too.  Kind of a hangover tradition for us Chandler alumni :)"}
{"text":"I love Elmer's.  Try the strips and sauce they are different but so good. They have great green chili burritos, shredded beef tacos are also a  favorite of mine. Avoid going here at lunch time mon thru fri it is very popular with chandler high kids."}
{"text":"Walked in on Sunday night at 8:20pm and there was still a heavy flow of people walking in. (They close at 9) They were definitely getting ready to close since almost a lot of the items that people were ordering they did not have or they maybe did not want to cook fresh. My sister n law ordered the mini machaca burrito and of course they were \"out.\" She ended up ordering a shredded beef one and to her disappointment it was full of more lettuce then meat...   I ordered a two tamale dinner plate which came with beans and rice. My sister ordered two tacos al pastor and her plate also came with beans and rice. (And chips)  My food? The tamales were surprisingly really good! I loved that they had a spicy flavor to them! The rice was also very flavorful and yummy! The beans? Ugh they were GROSS. They were dry and had maybe been left out all day...  The al pastor tacos were also pretty bland and I would never order them. All in all the lady at the front was nice and the place was clean. Three stars because a lot of their menu items they were \"out of.\""}
{"text":"Found freaking tiny bones in my chicken burrito! Sick ass place to eat. You'll have the chits by 10 o-clock"}
{"text":"This place had amazing food!!! Yummy!! I ordered one of each of the flavors I wanted to taste! Very affordable and I was floored how delish the food was !! Nothing like Taco Bell nothing!!! I hear it has long lines it's a local hot spot"}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty all in one place. I love their beans so I always get a bean tostada. I love their $3 menu too so I have to choose from that too. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Elmers since I was a kid! Nothing about the food has changed that I know of, it's always been amazing! Their green chilli is delicious and if your craving tacos, they have delicious tacos!! And it's cheap so you can really get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years and I will continue to keep going back. Bean and chesse burros are awesome. Love the potato tacos too."}
{"text":"Right around the corner from my sister's ghetto-tastic shack, this place is bomb. Green chile tostada...hell yes!   The place is not much to look at from the outside, not much to savor on the inside, but the only people hanging out here are Chandler High kids escaping 4th period.   You stand in line, you get your paper bag of greasy goodness, you leave with a smile on your face.   You hope your sister has beer in the fridge when you get back to her place."}
{"text":"Well I just got back from Elmer's and again as always their Green Hot Beef Burrito or as I call ity was out of this world. Here's a small little restaurant that the kids at Chandler high have been growing on for decades. Whether it's a Burrito ( My Favorite) Taco or Machaca you' never be disappointed. Filaberto's doesn't hold a candle to it and neither does any of the other chain slaughter houses in town."}
{"text":"Co worker showed me this place. He said this is where he went when he attended Chandler High school. Got a breakfast burrito chimi  style. Best burrito I've had in a long time. Will be coming back for a 2nd helping soon!"}
{"text":"Just moved here and got a recommendation from the place that serviced my car to come here. Glad I took the time to look it up, I was not disappointed!!! I had the machaca burrito and it was delicious. Can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Their beans are the best I've ever had! I always order their bean and cheese burrito. It's big and delicious. I've also tried their green chicken burrito which is spicy and yummy. Their red sauce is also really good. My husband always orders their red beef burrito to which he adds their beans and cheese, and gets it deep fried, so it basically becomes a chimichanga. He loves it. Their prices are great too. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Elmers is the bomb! Been coming here since high school many, many years ago and still today I run into people there from back in the day! That says a lot about the food here.  Elmer passed away a year or so ago but he should be very proud of his family for continuing on,  the food is just as good if not better.  It's a small, not fancy place but the food is addictive!"}
{"text":"If you're one to pass Arizona Ave on the Downtown Chandler area, you'll probably notice the adobe color painted building of Elmer's Tacos. Beautiful mural design of a desert landscape outside and more colored details ala Mexican motiff inside. They have patio tables up front and on the back, with plenty of parking for day and night customers. The restaurant itself is small and has a sufficient flow of AC air during Summer. It is also well-lighted thus it helps one to see clearly the picture menus on the upper wall. Casual and welcoming atmosphere, casual because it has the street-appeal eatery that customers in their Summer shorts and shirts, even on pajamas, can enjoy a meal, and welcoming because we were greeted when we walked in and friendly service on the counter.   I had a fish taco and horchata and would say they can do better, not really a big fan of fish and coleslaw filling, and the sugar on the horchata could use a cut-down. Price on all of their food is very reasonable. We were there at around 8:00 p.m. on a weekday, and at this time, the tables and floors have not been wipe out. Definitely a cheap eats, and although the food did not win me, i will still give this a try because of their casual ambiance, and hopefully my next order will be satisfying to my liking."}
{"text":"First of all the food is OK. I think people who haven't experience authentic Mexican food will think this place is awesome but for me it was OK. The staff however is some of the worst ever. Guy took my order and seemed like he did know what I was ordering. Asked for a lunch burrito and got a breakfast burrito. Not the brightest bulbs in the box but what do you expect."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the bean & cheese burritos! Just made a phone order for pick up to try it \"with sauce\" per most Yelpers recommendations... can't wait! Fish tacos are good. Tacos are street taco size, and they pack a lot of flavor- Delish. The place is not special but the food is =)"}
{"text":"Love this little dive every time I stop in. Food is great, fast, and priced just right. I know it's been around for over 30 years and glad it also has student discounts for the local high schoolers. The usual ladies are friendly and know the locals and regulars. My fave is simple chips and heaps of cheese and ms well as taco combo."}
{"text":"Food was simple but mostly tasty. The grilled fish taco was not good. Too \"fishy\". I couldn't eat it. However, the chile relleno was good. The inside of restaurant needs to be cleaned up a bit. I did like the family feel among the staff."}
{"text":"My personal favorite for Mexican food.  Consider giving this a four star as the soda here is horrible at best.  The beans are great as is the rice.  I love the enchiladas and the spicy chicken is also very good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Been going there for more than 20 years. Going to Chandler High and it being across the street... Literally. I would eat there at least 3 days a week. I loved hearing Elmer yell out \"Mini Chimis\" over and over. The hot sauce is the bomb! Anything you order is better than good. This small \"dive\" will be a favorite for life. RIP Elmer."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN! BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER! I did go to Chandler High, that was my first of many encounters with Elmer and his yummy food. I usually go about once or twice a month but have been known to hit it up weekly in the past. I've even turned the fam onto it, my kids usually get the bean and cheese burritos... ( I have to say, I am not a fan of bean and cheese burritos, but this place adds their salsa in them. One word. AMAZING!) I always get the cheese enchilada's and the strips. Ah the strips. Even if it is only chips and shredded cheese, the salsa makes it! I think you can even buy their salsa. They have always have specials, and my husband loves theier taco specials. Their bright building helps attract passerbys but if ur not looking u prob wont c it... I love how it's family owned and operated too. Just try it, U wont be sorry."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for the first time yesterday for lunch. We didn't realize the time and went shortly before noon, which is also when the high school students go there for lunch. Surprisingly the line moved super fast. We didn't have to wait long at all. I tried the cheese enchiladas with the rice and beans. So basic yet so good! I love the enchilada sauce. Perfect amount of spice and perfect flavor. Everyone in my group loved their food. We will definitely be back here often!"}
{"text":"This is my Chandler go to place for Mexican food. Some things to be aware of:    (1) during school lunches they are packed (2) you pay for the chips and salsa (3) there is a cost of refills  look beyond that and you will have some great food for a very decent price!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here years to eat. It doesn't matter what you get to eat here, it's all good. Service is fast and everybody is friendly!!"}
{"text":"This place-AMAZING.  I ordered the green chile burro with chicken and my friend ordered the bean and cheese burrito.  Both were bomb.  Looks like I'm going to be in Chandler a lot more often now!"}
{"text":"Elmer's tacos was a total treat - you have to try it!  I had the Pastor Burro, which is the best al pastor I have ever had (by far).  I try not to overeat, and yet I am pretty sure that if I had ordered two of them I would have finished them both.  The machaca is juicy and flavorful.  WE WILL BE BACK..."}
{"text":"Don't let the negative reviews scare you! This place is a hidden gem. It's been open for decades, and is family run. I gave 4 stars because I do not know much about the rest of the menu, simply because their bean and cheese burritos with sauce and their strips are SO good I have no need to experiment! I drive an hour to get their food. I feel like that speaks for itself :)   I'm gonna tackle some issues I've seen in other reviews:  Their sauce is amazing. Hands down. No, it's not super spicy, but the flavour more than makes up for that! It just has this perfect balance of salty, taste, and rich tomato Mexican goodness. I save the baggies to put on my own cooking, Chipotle, filbertos, taco bell... Etc. It is simply without comparison. And the neat little baggies are super convenient! Just tear a little hole in the corner, and you're good to go. No mess, no fuss.   The beans in their burritos are delicious. They don't just taste like beans, they have a rich yet subtle meat flavour as well. These are the bets beans I've ever had. Can't tell you how many gross, flavorless, mushy, paste like beans I've had. Not here!   Their strips are so good! I've seen people griping on here that they were given chips, a bag of cheese, and baggies of sauce. Assembling your chips is half the fun, and they are SO GOOD! They use rich good quality cheese, none of that plasticy nonsense, I already talked about the amazing sauce (though honestly I can't say enough about it) and their chips are perfection. Perfectly crunchy, light, crisp, with just the right amount of saltiness. Yum!!!!!   Their location does looks dated, but it is always absolutely clean and adds to their charm.   I saw another comment about a woman wearing glasses inside. She has light sensitivity. She isn't wearing them for fashion or to be disrespectful.   Their prices are pretty good for what you get! Downside is refills cost extra, but just order without ice.   The service here is amazing, too. On our last visit we ordered food to eat there (outside. Love it!) and burritos to take home. The woman who took our order was very kind, and insisted we take our two burritos out and eat, and she'd bring us the rest of our order when it was ready. We also saw the owners son on our way out. We hadn't seen him for close to a year, yet he remembered us and our last (and first) conversation and where we were living at that time without prompting. You just don't get that anywhere else!   I've been coming here for almost 10 years. The first time, I remember my friend ordering me a bean and cheese and being like, great. I hate these. I took a bite... And I've been in love ever since I've turned so many friends onto this place, they're just that good!   I absolutely love elmers and I will keep coming back no matter where I live for as long as their doors are open. When a restaurant is in business for this long, obviously they are doing something right. And think about it. What makes your grandparents secret recipes great? Love and years and years of experience. Elmers is no different!"}
{"text":"Been going here for 20+ years... never disappoints!! The red chili beef is amazing, but the standard for me is the strips and the bean & cheese burrito. Classics."}
{"text":"Wow, where to begin...So I show up about 30 minutes before closing.  As I walk in the door, I am greeted with a scowl by this miserable-looking woman working the register.  Her face read, \"How rude of this customer to show up when we close in 30 minutes, we're pretty much closed already!\" Before I am able to speak, she scowls further (didn't think that was even possible) and yells at the gentleman who ordered before me, \"Hey! Don't walk over there it's already been mopped!\" So now she turns back to me,  as i'm politely waiting with a smile on my face in hopes to brighten up her day.  My efforts were futile.  \"Yea?\" she asked (I guess that's her way of asking me what I want?).  I figured i'd go simple so not to cause this woman any further anger, so I politely asked for 2 chicken tacos. \"We don't have a deep fryer so no tacos, anything else?\" At this point I kindly said thank you, but I will be going elsewhere, have a great night.  I mean COME ON, how do you not have tacos when the name of your establishment is Elmer's TACOS, it's in the name for crying out loud!!!!  No way I will ever return to this place, you couldn't pay me to interact with or even look at that miserable woman again.  I HIGHLY suggest you stay away from this place!!!"}
{"text":"Elmer's is our family's favorite! I'm picky about my beans & rice (after growing up with my nana's homemade) and this is one of the few places I love both. We recently used them to cater a party and everyone commented on how good the food was. Last, but not least, I just saw on the news that they had a perfect health inspection. I  Elmer's!"}
{"text":"Growing up in chandler this place is one of the staples for everyone to go to for amazing Mexican food. But it wasn't until I became an Uber driver that I realized this place is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley! I love the bean and cheese burrito, the green chili burrito and of course you have to get the chips and cheese! This place is way underrated because people should be traveling from all over town to eat here. But I'm glad that this place is tucked away, keeping mainly locals and people like me who know of the deliciousness this place has to offer!"}
{"text":"I just had my usual order and it was just like I had 37 yrs ago when I was a sophomore at Chandler High! Been eating there ever since. The hot sauce is to die for!  I haven't been there for a while as I moved away and just found out Elmer had passed away. His daughter came over to my table and shared the news with me and my wife when I asked about him. Elmer's is loyal to the community and always has been. Again, the bean and cheese burritos and stripes along with the red hot sauce is like none other in the valley!  Thanks Elmer's! Eric"}
{"text":"i abso-fruit-ley love this place! The fact its just around the corner for me is awesome!  - The bean and cheese burrito with sauce is major noms. You can get it in the mini burrito size or regular size as well.   - the strips ... Why didn't I try this in the first place?! I try not to get it everytime, but I must say simplicity at its best. Just tortilla strips, salsa, and shredded cheese. Never had anything similar that tasted so good.   - other menu options I have tried is the chicken/been taquitos. Crunchy but very yummy. Also chicken tacos are really good as well.   Overall this place is pretty good. It the only mexican place worthy to visit numerous times."}
{"text":"I read the reviews of this place and decided my wife and I should try it out. It's a little hole in the wall and reminds me of a Filabertos type restaurant. We did take out for our dinner order. They were kind of busy and it took about 30 min to get our take out order. The food is significantly better than a Filabertos type restaurant. I had a chili releno  combo that was really good. My wife had their tamale combo and she thought they were great. We also had some fish tacos which I really enjoyed. The fish was grilled not fried, and were right up their with Rubios fish tacos. I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"After years of living in Chandler, I decided to finally check out this place. Elmer moved to the USA from Mexico and started this place in the early 70's. He took inspiration from his mother's recipes and has been serving his awesome tacos to the downtown Chandler area for decades. I love good authentic Mexican food and this place sells it at a good price. Definitely come on Taco Tuesdays for some great specials."}
{"text":"This place is quick and cheap. So I am all for that.  There really isn't a good taco Tuesday special, which I was looking for.   The tacos were decent and the burrito was decent. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was all good. Good ingredients, made fresh, and way better than taco bell or filabertos."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here because I had read good reviews. Maybe we went on a bad day. They were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order. I got a chicken, carne asada and fish taco. The Chicken was the best. I didn't care for the carne asada or the fish. Guedos fish tacos are far superior. I don't think that we will return to Elmer's with all the great Mexican food choices in the area. Sorry."}
{"text":"Going to Chandler High school I became a lifelong Elmer's fan, nothing beats strips and a bean and chee."}
{"text":"WOOHOOO ELMERS! Grew up near AZ ave been going forever, Definitely a local favorite, everyone knows Elmer's (;"}
{"text":"In every city, usually across the street or within a short walk of the High School there is a neighborhood hangout.   The food can run from just average, to exceptional. Elmer's tends to be mostly in the latter camp over the former, what a wonderful surprise.  My two coworkers and I came here for a late lunch yesterday. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. Heck, even on the inside it doesn't either.   Yes, Elmer's is a hole in the wall type place. One that probably wouldn't even make Guy Fieri's DDD list. But the food is good.  I ordered chips, steak burrito and a drink. The tab came to under $9 and if you look at the picture of the chips, it's kind of basic. The Salsa btw comes in plastic squirt bottles. LOL.   But my steak burrito was the real deal and bomb! Take a look at my picture and know that Chipotle has nothing on this bad boy. It tasted as good as it looks and it's only $5.85.  Nice.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After hearing the reviews we had to try this place since we were told it was one of the best places in Chandler.  We ordered the tacos and they were good.  Very filling.  I did see Indian Fry Bread on the menu and don't see that often so we had to order one.  It was not very good.  It was too thick and doughy.  Everything else was good.  Long wait and great prices.  I would come back to try more items.  As long as I have patience for the lines."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING at Elmer's is great. The refried beans are one of a kind, delicious. The taco sauce you can eat by the spoonfuls. The simple buttered tortilla with sauce seems so simple, but also delicious. Tacos, strips, breakfast burritos, bean burritos, and carne asada are also great. Haven't had anything we didn't like."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker. Heard these guys had bomb food and I've been wanting a California carne asada burrito. Place was pretty small but didn't look too gross from the inside (i get grossed out easily when i see that a  restaurant doesnt keep their place clean and u can just tell if its dirty or not)   Cashier was very nice and there weren't any lines (got there around 12:30pm on a Friday) Anyways, I bought a cali burrito no pico de gallo with French fries and sour cream for about $7. Wasn't too excited about it. Didn't Wow me at all.  I actually was expecting more from here especially with the good reviews. Maybe I just came on the wrong day or something. Burrito was medium sized. Del taco got bigger burritos for the same price. Anyways I won't be here anytime soon.   It was ehhhh"}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall but excellent find in the heart of downtown Chandler. I stopped by for lunch as many co-workers were talking about Elmers so had to try it out and glad I did. The tacos pastor and carne asada were excellent and refried beans were greasy goodness. Service was also quick and prices were reasonable. Only downside is the small amount of inside seating."}
{"text":"The absolute best. Have never been disappointed & we've been going to elmers for almost 16 years now."}
{"text":"Such a unique and tasty approach to Mexican/American style cuisine.  The Green chile tamale was sweet and tasty.  Never had a sweet tamale before.  The Machaca burrito was super good.  My girlfriend got a mini chimi that I thought would be super crunchy but it wasnt and was delicious.  However, the best part of the meal was the flavor in their refried beans.  The lady made a perfect Horchata with light ice,  New to the area, but this is my new spot."}
{"text":"We always hear about this place so we decided to try it & that was definitely a mistake. First of all the old lady at the counter was extremely rude! Maybe it's because it's hot as hell inside that place?! She was very unprofessional wearing sunglasses inside as she took our order, also we've never been so we had questions about the menu & sure enough this lady had the nerve to get an attitude because I had questions.  Food was not great at all, it was extremely hot inside, & that lady had the WORST customer service. I'm pretty sure Elmer would not have liked her attitude.  Never returning to that place."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Nothing more. Nothing less. Decent, affordable and tasty food in a no nonsense setting. Cool history and a great downtown location. Always love the salsa bags!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Arizona, period.  The Elmer's signatures are (1) its sauce (my mother buys 32oz at a time to take home), which is spicy, fresh, and delicious. (2) strips, which are simply tortilla chips with shredded cheese  I love the pastor tacos and the pastor burrito. Pastor is a spicy pork, and Elmer's loads it with cilantro and onions. Get it early though... if you get the pastor just before close, it won't be as fresh.  In December, they offer their tamales for Christmas Eve, just make sure you place your order a few weeks out.  Lately, everything has gotten a bit more greasy than it used to be (especially the refried beans)... if you are looking for \"healthy\" Mexican food, keep looking.  If you get there during Chandler High's lunch hour, look for the non-student line to the right, or call in your order ahead of time. I have the number programed into my cell phone :)"}
{"text":"I like to grab breakfast or lunch here on occasion. I like the food. Good amount of meat for the price. I actually stopped going to my normal Mexican food place, and switched to Elmers because of the better price and serving size. The only thing I don't like is the extra charge for the salsa, as mentioned in other reviews. It's kind of like if McDonald's charged for ketchup. Overall, it's good to go."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to Elmer's because she went to Chandler High. This place is now one of my favorite places to get a burrito in the Valley. The dining area may not be the best but the food and service is great."}
{"text":"I only like authentic Mexican food and this place was it!!! I loved their tacos and their quesadillas are amazing!!! It is a cute little place and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"In business for decades. Been here that long because they're AWESOME! Best burros and horchata ever. I recommend the green chile burro. Great stuff."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time after our mother in law told us how good it was! Well let me tell you it was all very delicious!!   We both had the #6 plate which was just three cheese enchiladas with red sauce included with a side of rice and beans/ and a small handful of chips and lettuce they topped it off with.   The beans were amazing!!! They were really hot it almost burnt my tongue (so be careful) but it def had some bacon flavor to it and it was all mushy and just delicious!!!!! The red sauce surprising had a good spicy kick to it and taste very full and authentic!! Overall the meal was excellent for the price!   Speaking of prices my husband and I paid about $19.00 and some change for two meals one large drink we shared which normally would cost us 30.00 eating out, I don't know if u know a better deal but for the amount of food we got it was a steal!!  Utensils were okay, they look like the forks and knifes/spoon came from the dollar store but hey it's the food that matters!!!   The lady who took my order was very nice and can tell she knew a lot of the regulars that went there! If you have time I'd recommend you go check it out! Elmers by far has the best bang for your buck and quality in foods!"}
{"text":"good mexican food.  better than filibertos and guedo taco shop down the street.  and oh yeah, its a drive thru to go place, so if its fresh, clean and tasty, thats all u need ;)"}
{"text":"Got a Carne asada burro and a fish taco. Hubby got a green chili burro and a Carne asada taco. Carne was super chewy and something in the carne burro was extremely salty. The fish taco had tartar sauce. The green chili says hot on the menu. No spice at all! Sauce packets are messy bags if tomato sauce, again no spice and pretty flavorless. I seriously don't get the hype about this place. I imagine this is what Mexican restaurants in Minnesota or Idaho are like lol! I will stick to Los Favs and Si Senor for some hot @ss green chili.  Also they have no green sauce only red :("}
{"text":"My husband decided to take me to his old stomping grounds and said we had to try this staple!!! Seriously, he was right (doesn't happen too often).   This restaurant has been in Chandler for years and offers a large menu of traditional Mexican food. There is tons of parking on the side and in front. The interior is a little small but considering how long it has been in this location, it is big for the time.   This is the place to go when you don't want to spend a fortune but want something delicious! I had a simple bean and cheese burrito but seriously, it was the best I have ever had. They even had mini fried cones that had different combos. I took one to go!!  The prices were great since they were pretty cheap and honestly I loved this little hole in the wall!  Don't forget the Horchata, always the best was to end a meal. Now go eat some awesome Mexican food, Cinco De Mayo is coming up!"}
{"text":"This place is fire. If you ever find yourself in a desperate situation of hunger on Arizona avenue near chandler high school then you need to find the nearest route to elmers."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food for the price! I have been eating at Elmers since it first opened on the corner and it is still a favorite."}
{"text":"I little hole-in-the wall place but makes the traditional Mexican food. Love the tamales near the holidays but they are available all year."}
{"text":"I haven't deviated much from the basics of chips and chorizo burritos but this place will always be special since we graduated from Chandler high almost 15 years ago! The hot sauce is sooooooo good! The burritos are always huge and they definitely don't skimp on chorizo."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been going there for 13 years.  Everything tastes so authentic.  Went there last night, and the line was out the door.  Always good."}
{"text":"I think my expectations were too high when I tried out this place the past weekend with my fellow food critic, Marisa. We found it on yelp and we were encouraged by the good reviews, but it's possible that these were all written by past Chandler high grads with nostalgia in their heads. We arrived on a Saturday at two pm to avoid the school crowd and were greeted with a line and a full house. This gave us time to peruse the menu and decide on a combo plate. We both got the burrito and I got the strips and an extra taco. The strips are regular tortilla chips with cold grated cheddar cheese. Not what I expected from the reviews and not satisfying. The taco was in a hard shell that was freshly made and defintely benefited from the packet of red sauce thrown in the bag. The burrito with verde sauce was very spicy, very runny, which made it hard to eat and enjoy. The beef inside was good but I still had a hard time eating it. The girl behind the counter was very nice despite the constant interruptions for refills and more customers. She happened to be elmers daughter, so it was nice to know that we were supporting local business. Fortunately I'm not in Chandler much and have access to other local Mexican food restaraunts in phoenix."}
{"text":"We've heard so much about this place, about how famous it is. We brought our entire family this morning after our children's baseball game. We found out what they're famous for. We spent so much money and all our orders were wrong. We waited so long for them to be corrected and our dad is diabetic. It was awful they gave us chips thrown in a box with shredded cold cheese on top. I explained this to a few women up front and I was given SO much attitude. I asked for a manager and they said they don't have one. The women up front started talking bad in Spanish about me and I knew what they were saying because I SPEAK Spanish!!!!!!!!!! I'm so upset right now I'm typing this while we're still here. The beans taste like they're from a can and we all spent so much and didn't even eat their food. They don't have anyone respectively to speak to so here is my 100% honest review"}
{"text":"love, love, love the strips and cheese.  i have also had catering from here, very affordable. everyone loved the food! the potato tacos were a hit. and everyone loved the bean burritos. if you are ever having a get together and want to get mexican food for everyone without emptying your wallet, i would recommend getting catering to go from here. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I drive here from Fountain Hills when I want my cost effective Authentic Mexican Fix. They are the real thing and the way the spices mix I know someone to up before the sun cooking every day. Truly a find. Thank you Matt Z for turning me in to this treat!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here with my parents a few times and we're never disappointed. The El Pastor is the best I've ever had, anywhere! We have never had trouble parking here, even when it's busy. Service is always great and fast. The salsa is delicious and can go on everything. We always look forward eating here!"}
{"text":"Amazing, but everyone that has ever gone to Chandler High School always returns to Elmers!  Why?  Because they have great food!  Bean and cheese burro with sauce and strips - I have only had this meal a thousand or more times in the last 30 years...  Elmers hot sauce is the best ever - and the cheese on the strips tastes SO GOOD along with that hot sauce!!!  Not much on decor inside, so get it to go -and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is out-of-control good!  Definitely try the green chili many burritos... A word of caution avoid this place at high noon it will be flooded with high school students.   I prefer the chicken machaca and green chili beef burritos. Very good!"}
{"text":"There pastor meat is awesome! Always get great service from the guys behind the counter. The inside seating is a bit small but they have a good amount outdoor seating as well. The mini chimichangas are good too. And the beans are always on point as well. Keep up the good work Elmer's!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a hole in the wall fast food Mexican . I had a breakfast burrito and it was pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Good food for a \"fast food\" joint, but not very fast. If you are on a lunch break, or have limited time, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Ok, Elmer's isn't the BEST Mexican I've ever had but, it's damn good and for about $10 I stuffed myself silly. The food is very good quality and I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I have lived in Chandler for nearly 6 years and finally made it into Elmer's. Honestly, it was the praise this place received on Facebook groups Ocotillo Friends and Living Chandler that pushed me to try. I am glad I did! The staff was friendly and quick. I had 2 mini burritos and they both were tasty. One was machaca beef and the other one was beef and red sauce. My friend had taquitos and she likes them as well. Chips and Salsa is a must for me so I ordered them. Since it was my first time there, the lady gave them to me at no charge. So nice! The chips and salsa were yummy too, although I didn't get why they had shredded cheese all over it. It was good but made it messy. Although after seeing other reviews, that must be their thing. The only thing I wish is that there wasn't a charge for drink refills, however I guess when you are across from a high school, maybe that is wise. I would definitely go back and try other things. I love supporting local. I am looking forward to my next trip to Elmers!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos! I popped in one day based on reviews and really liked it. They have mini burritos so I tried two and they were really good."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but I was disappointed after reading the positive reviews. The salsa and both the chicken and shredded beef in the tacos had very little flavor. The order of chips comes with a lot of cold cheese poured over it. That, along with the weak salsa, made for a sad little side. I love small businesses and the hard work the employees put in, but the food needs to be better."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and amazing. They make accommodations when I order burritos with no tortilla. The staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"My bad luck continues they burned our buritos.  And the guy across has burned food too I'm watching the cowboy eat it burned. And the cook gave me a mean look. Why send out bruned food.  I love this place. The bean burittos are great but you have to wonder if they are that careless is the food sanitary"}
{"text":"The beef tacos are pretty good the corn tortilla is on the small side also has a a bit of additives and or preservatives in the corn tortilla. Quality of count tortilla lacked . The flour tortillas were excellent Beans super good! Rice was a bit tasteless Salsa; mild, was a bit on the weak side lacking some flavor and pungency(  maybe it was a bad batch) the chicken  in the chicken tacos tasted boiled . I have a pet peeve with boiled tasting chicken in my chicken tacos . Would I come back?  if I was in the area I would Have the red chili beef burrito and I'll try other dishes but what I've had so far I could get a better quality at ponchos on central and baseline"}
{"text":"Coming from New Mexico, Mexican food is in my DNA. I have tried many things here but I come for one thing and that is the bean and cheese burrito! Tastes like it came from my mothers kitchen!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Elmer's by a friend of mine. I swear, I am addicted to the Buttered Torillas with Sauce but I love the Special Burro as well!!! Great food at Great prices. GO GO GO!!! Gotta little hole in the wall place that have a great product!!!"}
{"text":"This place stinks the grounds have trash everywhere don't order here the kitchen is dirty how did they pass inspection? Don't order don't order just look at the place"}
{"text":"My buddy grew up in Chandler, so he took me here since he's been eating here for ages.  I had a delicious, moist carne asada taco, killer crispy chicken taco and an insanely spicey but tasty green chile burrito.  I though I liked spicey, but this burrito was next level hot.  Gonna try the red chile next visit.  Love the strips and cheese and the bottles of sauce they give you when you dine in.  The pastor is also on point."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE DURING SCHOOL LUNCH HOURS.  Just a little warning.  Made that mistake one time and won't make it again.  Although, I have to give them credit- the high schoolers get their own line and their food is ready made.  Anyway, My husband thinks this place rocks and doesn't want to get fast food Mexican anywhere else.  He hoards the salsa packets and brings them home and puts them on everything.  Personally, I think it's good, but does leave a little to be desired.  It is greasy.  Very greasy.  I like to get one of three things.  The bean and ground beef tostada, the ground beef burrito or the machacha chicken tacos (not as greasy).  I haven't ventured far from those things though.    The refried beans are the best I have ever had and I have to steal the recipe some day.  The rice is blah.    The service is okay.  The food takes a little while to come out, especially if you go during a rush hour.  The layout leaves something to be desired because the place gets so busy.  Location is awesome.  Always clean."}
{"text":"Best Bean and Cheese and Large Strips in the world. Been coming here for since 93 and have never eaten anything that wasn't good! PERIOD."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's amazing how delicious a simple bean and cheese burrito can be.  Their red sauce is perfect, their green chile is to die for, and their strips + cheese are amazing.  When I go, I usually get the mini burritos - because I like to have both the bean / cheese & green chile.  If you like Mexican food, go to Elmer's and you won't be disappointed.  I also give credit to their location, and their student prices, getting all those Chandler High students addicted to their tasty food early on creates nostalgia for their taste buds & guarantees \"for life\" customers.  Bravo."}
{"text":"My parents have been coming here since the 80s, so I've been a lifetime patron, literally. Although I don't live close by, I try to come here about once a month for my fix of that salsa, omg! Elmer's is the nicest hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant I've ever visited. While it's definitely fast food, it is 10,000x better than a Filiberto's or any other fast food Mexican place.   Everything on the menu is great, but I always order the beef machaca burrito. Do it! So flavorful and juicy; I've never had better machaca anywhere else! If I'm here with my fam, we will order \"strips\" (chips and cheese) and a cheese quesadilla to share. The horchata is good but can be a little gritty at times. Elmer's makes their salsa in-house and serves it in squeeze bottles at each table. My brother and I fight over it, so we grab two bottles since we cannot share. They sell little salsa packets you can take home - I never leave without a few!"}
{"text":"Elmer's Tacos has been around for a long time and I enjoy it every time I go. The owner is nice and has a funny sense of humor. Value wise, this place is hard to beat. The burrito's, tacos, and bean & cheese cones for $1 is a killer deal and so much tastier than some other places around the same price. The inside is very small so the seating is not that great but the food is delicious and I'll go anytime I'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"I've had Elmer's bookmarked for a while. I ordered 6 different tacos to try different kinds with my husband. They weren't good. Carne Assad taco meat was extremely chewy. The fish tacos were so fishy I think the fish may have gone bad, I took one bite and couldn't finish. I agree with other posts the charges for things like guacamole are outrageous. Chipotle charges either the same or less and gives you more - also a higher quality. Machaca beef was mostly vegetables. Spicy chicken literally had no spice to it. I don't know. Maybe it was an off night. The mini chimis were very good - their salsa is fantastic but everything else was just plain bad. Not sure I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food !   Service is fast and staff are efficient .  Don't let a packed parking lot fool you.  They'll get you in and out in a jiffy."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. They have been around forever and have become iconic in the area. The green chili is very hot though so beware if you don't like extreme spice."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place because of the great reviews on yelp, however, after going there I realized that those reviews are from people who have been coming here for a while. In my opinion, those reviews are not very representative of how good Elmer's is, but the 2-3 start reviews are.  First, I have to agree with everyone, and even those people that gave this place poor reviews mentioned this, that the customer service here is great.  The girl and guy that were working at the counter were extremely helpful, especially when we told them that it was our first time at Elmer's. They told us all the most popular dishes and even gave us extra items off the menu for free to try. After all of that, I actually feel bad giving this place such a low review, but the food just wasn't good  We ordered the bean and cheese burrito, the green chili burrito, got free \"strips\" (all of which everyone was raving about), and also decided to try a tamale.  Out of everything we ordered, the tamale ended up being our favorite, and it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  The bean and cheese burrito and the green chili burrito did not taste any different than the frozen burritos I buy from the grocery store. They were edible and not terrible, but not something I would go out of my way to buy when I can get the same thing at Fry's for 25 cents.  As for the \"strips\"--which apparently have some kind of following because one of the customers in line also told us they were amazing and the worker told us people drive hours to order--I did not understand those at all, even though the workers and customers swore by them. We were give a box of (stale) chips with cold shredded cheese on them and a lot of salsa packets. We were told to drench the chips in salsa, and eat as is!! DO NOT MICROWAVE! So we came home, curious as to how this would taste. Did exactly what we were told. And lo and behold.....they tasted like stale chips with cold cheese and bland salsa. We were so confused that we put even more salsa on them and that failed because they ended up tasting worse. I don't know what we missed, maybe they taste magical when you're slightly inebriated, I don't know. All I know is that this place did not cut it for me.  So 2 stars for the food and the third star is for the great service."}
{"text":"I love Elmers. Their fish tacos are one of my absolute favorite. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Elmer's bean & cheese with red sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"If you want fancy, this is NOT the place! If you want hearty, authentic, spicy, homemade Mexican food, and stripped-down surroundings are fine by you, then Elmer's is the place for you.   Elmer's has been feeding Chandler area students (Chandler HS is right across the street), police, firefighters, city workers, businessmen, and connoisseurs of fine Mexican food for 30 years. family owned & operated."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and both times have been terrible customer service by the lady with the dark glasses. First, her attitude is immediately received along with her huffing. She rolls her her eyes if you ask for more salsa or different salsa. Today she attempted to charge extra for sauce that should be included in an order. I purchased four tacos and only received one packet of their red salsa.   More than $3 per taco is ridiculous. I dont care how good or bad your tacos are.  Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here with a buddy who got a bean and cheese burrito and a double decker. Amazing food, cool atmosphere. Quaint little shop but has the atmosphere of Wallstreet!! Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Mexican food place in chandler. Go to items are strips and sauce and bean burrito. Pretty good place that's very popular. You are going to stand in line, but it's worth the wait. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We love, love, love this place!!!  The asada is heaven!  The salsa and chips are so addictive.  The service is great and this is truly a great \"hole in the wall\"!!!"}
{"text":"Elmer's tacos is a family owned business that has been in the valley since 1974, when my daughter used to attend Chandler High School I used to hear how my money was spent during her lunches at Elmer's and how good they are, but I somehow never made it there. Life moved on, years went by and I was hanging out with my daughter and we had a chore to run in Chandler and she was like I am not leaving Chandler until we stop at Elmer's! So off we went!  It was around 8pm on a Tuesday night, not very crowded, checked out the menu and knew I had to try the red chili beef burrito and I wanted to throw in some beans into it, which they did at no extra charge. I also got a small order of strips, daughter has been raving about these.  The red chili beef & bean burrito was legit! Should have gotten another one for lunch the next day! Tortilla was fresh, beef was tender and the red chili gravy was on point! Just what I was craving!  The strips are freshly made corn tortilla chips served with shredded cheese and their hot sauce. O M G I could make a meal out of them, next time I will get them with beans added. So dang good!  I don't know why it has taken me so long to stop by Elmer's but I know I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"elmers is amazing. best mexican food in az if you want that home made kind of food. the art in the alley behind it is cool too! breakfast burritos, bean abd cheese, fried green chili burro, mini chimis,  the emlbers burger, fry bread, etc. all keep me eating there weekly!"}
{"text":"We were debating between coming here or going to our old favorite: Moreno's just down the street. Since we found Moreno's by ditching this place a year ago, we decided to try this place out for dinner just to see if we were missing anything. The end result was no, we weren't missing anything by skipping out on this place for so long. The outside looks really outdated and run down but sometimes you can't judge places by how they look on the outside.  The inside was pretty clean but also looked like a flashback to the 90's. There was no one in there when we went so we got to order right away, although there was no greeting and the cashier had a serious attitude problem. I was intrigued to see that they offer Indian fry bread but I went ahead and ordered the cheese enchiladas with a chile relleno, and my partner ordered the mini chimi's.   We waited not too long and the cashier clomped out with our food and left it in a huff on our table. If you eat there, the meals come in to go styrofoam containers and I began to wonder where the silverware was. When I opened up the container I saw that the forks were on top of the food inside, can you say gross? I don't like it when the top of my straw has been touched by the waiter. It reminded me of going to a buffet and finding the spoon has been dropped into the food.  Prices were low but they charged $1.50 for a side of guacamole and extra for sour cream for a dish (chimichangas) that should already come with it. Not a huge helping, one of those small condiment to go containers. The guac had more onions than avocados and the mini chimi's never specified what kind of meat was inside, so they were filled with some mystery mixture that appeared to be mostly beans with essence of beef. The taco meat appeared to be dry but on the plus side the rice was moist and I could smell the tomato sauce.   The chile relleno I ordered was spongy at best and the enchiladas were forgettable in flavor. The beans were very greasy but hey this isn't health food right?   I can't blame those Chandler High student for getting addicted to this place, teenagers don't know any better. Telling people the only way to get authentic Mexican food is to travel to Mexico or to get real ethnic food is to travel to that prospective country does not make any sense. You would have to tell all of the ethnic home cooks including my parents that in order to make \"real\" food they have to go back to their countries and cook it there. People who come from other countries if they do it right, are perfectly able to replicate the same meals in America. Restaurants can be authentic if they tried.   So while I wait for my dad to return from Cuba and Panama, and my mom to return from Spain with my meal, I will just say this place is not worth it. I recommend Moreno's if you are restricted to this area only or La Tolteca in Phoenix if you can travel."}
{"text":"I've lived here in Chandler for most of my life and always hear how Elmers is a staple. I will say while the food is good, it's way overrated. Many other Mexican joints better than Elmers.  The owners are so cheap too. From the products they provide (utensils, napkins, etc) to their up charge for EVERYTHING.  I'll go again, but only because it's in the area or because I'm tagging along with others"}
{"text":"Elmers has been a staple for a very long time. They have amazing food, the people are great, and you feel like family when your here.  I hope to continue coming here for years to come."}
{"text":"Awesome small taco shop, the double decker tacos are amazing with a small or large strips. Good prices too."}
{"text":"Searching for a new taco spot and this one is close to home. The tacos are good!  Carne Asada, grilled chicken and shredded beef are my favorite. Their homemade hard shells are great too. I usually don't like refried beans but theirs are good. Go on Taco Tuesday, otherwise it can get a little pricey."}
{"text":"Beans and tortillas are top notch.  Quality of food for price is outstanding.  Support your local mom and pop and eat here!"}
{"text":"Elmer's Taco Shop is one of my favorite spots in the East Valley area to get Mexican food.  It has ample seating both indoors and outdoors and the prices are very affordable with Chandler HS across the street (but don't go during the high school lunch hour, the line is out the door.) Definitely try the strips  or the cheesy tortilla with beef. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here fir 20 years. Glad I can share the experience with my kids who now get to enjoy the same place."}
{"text":"Tasty, affordable and quick. Friendly staff. I liked the mini burrito options to try favorites. My go to is the chicken green chile burrito. The Beef enchilada my husband had was fantastic and tostada was delicious. We ordered nachos which come with shredded cheese, unmelted and were handed a hot sauce. It looked weird but was different and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Typical Caucasian imitation tacos. Nothing special here. I wish I would of had the chance to eat them before the original founder had passed away. Somehow customers haven't noticed the difference in quality"}
{"text":"My first two visits to Elmer's were good ones.  I've tried the green chili burro (excellent, quite spicy), beef tacos (average), bean and cheese burro (very good), red beef burro (very good) and their rice and beans are both quite tasty.    Service is very quick and friendly.  Convenient parking right off of Arizona Avenue,  just north of Chandler Blvd.  I would assume it is very busy during school lunch hours with the high school not far away, so I've avoided those hours.  Each time I've been there it's been relatively slow (no line) with just a handful of people in the dining area.  Prices are fair and you get a good amount of food for your buck.  Will be on my regular rotation of Mexican joints!"}
{"text":"I've been by here several times in the 2 years since we've moved to AZ. Tried for the first time tonight!  There was a 2 for $12 dinner special.  I had the chicken enchiladas-so juicy and flavorful.  He had the beef taco special.  Crunchy and spicy.  We ate in and loved the common but authentic decor.  Very clean and great service.  So glad I found this place!   I'll b back!"}
{"text":"Anytime we have been here this place has been great between the service and the food! The shrimp fajitas are by far our favorite. With a side of chips and guac! Yes please. Small little place with food that will keep you coming back no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"Very best place to go stop hating this I was very saddened by the passing of the owner of this place it was very clean and nice place to eat at"}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was missing! Bean and cheese burrito is outstanding(don't forget the red sauce)! Hard workers putting out tasty food!"}
{"text":"I love going here. They have the best food, and are always very friendly. Their prices are reasonable. Their bean and cheese cone is cheap and DELICIOUS. Perfect for any hunger fix."}
{"text":"If you ask anyone that grew up in Chandler about Elmer's, they will tell you it's a pillar in the neighborhood. Positioned directly across from Chandler High School, Elmer's has served quite a few generations of students for lunch and their families on the weekends and evenings alike. Grab yourself one of their famous orders of strips, bean and cheese burrito, or red Chile burro with some of their homemade hot sauce and a large Horchata and you won't be hungry until the next day. Be sure to bring your patience because you won't be the only one salivating in line to get one of the best burros in town. TBH - sometimes the lady taking your order is crabby, but to be fair, she has been there every time I have ever visited, so maybe I would be crabby too if I was working a million hours like her. If you can look past that, and past the fact that there is no one there to clean the tables between guests, and no napkins on the tables since they are hiding them from the messy students, you will surely be in burro bliss."}
{"text":"If your looking for some fancy smancy  trendy Mexican bistro then stop reading,  this place is not for you!  No fancy table and chairs here, and the murals are borderline tacky. But the food, the food is comforting and delishisly satisfying!   So good, I've been coming here regularly for the past 25 years. I hate to sound like a broken record, but everything on the menu is good!  If you have children, the mini bean and cheese burritos are the perfect size, just ask for no sauce as it might be too spicy for the young ones.  My favorite is a red beef burro with beans, and a large order of strips with extra cheese. put some hot sauce on each strip one at a time while you eat them and you'll be in heaven. Whats the price like, you ask? I know of no other place, where you can feed a family of four for under $20!!!! and leave completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"I went here because a friend recommended. I love those carne asada soft tacos. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great lunch joint. High school down the street gets a discount, avoid around 11 on a school day. I usually get a couple of mini burritos. Strips=chips."}
{"text":"If there were a hierarchy for calorie-rich Mexican food, Taco Bell wouldn't even be able to see Elmers from the bottom. This place is incredible- even if you don't like refried beans you've got to try Elmers. I don't know how they make their red sauce but its out of this world. For first timers I recommend the combination plate with a taco, tostada and mini chimi. Just can't beat it"}
{"text":"Elmer's is the only thing my mother ever craved when she was pregnant with me. Since before I was born, I have been completely addicted to Elmer's. My entire family has been going there since forever. We have Elmer's cater for ever family party because it is just THAT good. You can not go wrong with anything you get to eat. Just drench your food in that perfect Elmer's sauce and life is amazing. If you have not eaten here, you have not lived."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was great, and the customer service was amazing. They were so helpful and let us try samples of their meats. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my all time fave mexi spots in AZ. Located directly across from Chandler High School, and somewhat of a small spot so if you aren't paying attention you can pass it right on up.   I've never had any complaints on their food as it's always been fresh and tasty to the very last bite. I miss not living on that side of town in regards to missing out on good lil spots like this. North Scottsdale doesn't really have any good hole in the wall spots for mexi food, so it's a treat when I can make a stop by here"}
{"text":"1/4/14. Wow!  I have lived in the area for over 10 years and love Mexican food.  Unfortunately, this is the worst food I have had in many years.  Choose another place!  One star.  12/28/15 UPDATE I am a fan now.  A friend told me I was way off base with my first review.  2 years later I returned and enjoyed myself!  I will now recommend this place!  Three stars."}
{"text":"I really don't know why this place gets so many good reviews. It is very dirty. Very old. It gets busy and the service is horribly slow. And honestly the food is just greasy and nasty.  The reviews say it's a great place for cheap good Mexican food. But it's not even cheap.  The salsa is not fresh. And the guacamole is pretty tasteless. When you order tortilla chips and salsa... They put package shredded cheese on and not melted.  I had a taco salad and I couldn't even finish eating it.   If you like really quick and bad American Mexican food and then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Elmer's has been a staple in downtown Chandler for many years. We recommend starting with the strips + hot sauce. Our favorites are their mini red or green chile burros."}
{"text":"Carne Asada street tacos, rice and Horchata.  I spent a week waxing lyrical about these 3, but I still don't think I can find the right words.    If you're getting your kids the bean burrito, you better make it the regular large size, because if you're like me, you'll end up eating half of it because it's that freakin good."}
{"text":"This place has good Tacos. Split order in half between Carne Asada and Pastor. Pieces of Meat are larger than most Taco shops.  The Salsa could have been better  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Bean and cheese with sauce and a small strips!!!! That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Have been going to Elmers since I started high school in 88. Always had great service and yummy food. Elmer even knows all his customers from the high school then and now.   Elmers is a family tradition for us. We have even gone there to get a new mom their first meal after delivery. That tradition will continue with my twin grandchildren when they come in March."}
{"text":"Great food as always. Love the new look!.  Amazing customer service as well. Love me some strips! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and can't get enough of it. Wish I had one next to my house so I can come here everyday. But for now I will just make my weekly trips. I will recommend this place any or every time someone says they want Mexican food."}
{"text":"I entered the restaurant and stood at the counter for awhile before someone come from the back to help me. I looked over the menu and when with the Steak Taco and a Fish Taco as well as the special on the board a Green Chili Chicken Burrito... I rate the experience as followed.  The Steak Taco - B Fish Taco - B Green Chili Burrito - B+ Staff - C  I kind of wonder how a place like this can charge for a few chips but they do... All I wanted to do was enjoy some salsa and not get a dirty look and answer when I asked do you charge for chips... Spare me a few chips I just spent $14 bucks... But all in all I really enjoyed the meal I could eat a bowl of what was in the green chili burrito."}
{"text":"Great food try the pastor burrito I would eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner if I could."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is all about.  I've been wanting to try this place and finally made it to Elmers.  When I walked in the place smelled amazing and it was quite busy. I had high hopes! I had a Carne Asada burrito and beef taco. My wife ordered three of the mini burritos (red chili, machaca and chicken). The Carne Asada burrito had more pico de gallo then it did meat. On all of our burritos, the tortillas seemed like they weren't fully cooked. The flavor of the meat was pretty good but I've had better.  The taco was miniature!  Though it was a decent taco, I was disappointed with the size.  I prefer el Sol than Elmers, you can really taste the difference."}
{"text":"I've been going to Elmer's ever since I was an extremely young child. Going there is one of the best memories I have with my dad. I love Elmer's and everyone that works there."}
{"text":"Grabbed some tacos on the way to my class today, after work. 2 fish tacos, 1 spicy chicken and 1 tea. Iced tea was disgusting and i told them so, they agreed and actually dumped all of their remaining tea out. I have gotten no apology, but did get a refill with watered down Horchata.  Tacos were alright. Nothing really to write home about. Just average good taco. Does not qualify for a big deal in my book. Stop by there or keep driving is totally up to you. If i were in your car i would have said - \"Whatever\"."}
{"text":"What a nice little spot on arizona Ave. They offer doordash for to go orders, nice patio for dining in. Good prices for a lot of food."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has been around so long. Great food, good prices, and the customer service is too notch. I don't think its possible to order anything bad from the menu."}
{"text":"Been here since the 70s (I think) for an F-ing reason! I've never seen this place without a line. It's home-made goodness at its best! Enough said! I could drink the hot sauce... OMG it makes me drool.... Elmer's is the family owned and operated place you wanna get your Mexican food from! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! My personal fav is the taco and chimi combo with decedent rice and beans. But a pint of their sauce. You'll be drinking it too it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"So I go there and order a red chili burrito and pay extra for potatoes and end up getting mostly greasy french fries and they put less chili.  So pay extra only to get robbed of most of chili from the burrito.    I will be posting a pic tonight!"}
{"text":"Very slow to get food. Out of one ingredient for one taco which is why but could have at least delivered the rest of the order while prepping the ingredient. C'mon people!"}
{"text":"There are few places in a downtown of most cities that reflect the personality of the community. Elmers tacos seems to do it. Reasonably priced, tasty, fast and efficient. Highly recommended for an informal slice of Chandler.  No frills but a great value."}
{"text":"Bean and cheese with sauce and large strips has been my staple there now for over 30 years! Nothing more I can say than an absolutely PHENOMENAL Mexican food joint with incredible history and delicious food."}
{"text":"I had been on the hunt for an amazing Mexican place for years. I can hands down say this is my favorite restaurant. The ground beef tacos and enchiladas are my favorite and the price is affordable"}
{"text":"This is a favorite in Chandler.  I didn't grow up in Chandler but was introduced to this place when I started working in the east valley.  My old coworker would go on and on about this place about how it was right across of Chandler High and he always got a bean and cheese with strips every day after school.  So they renovated recently but this place use to be a dive.  Benches were tired and old, and when this place gets packed, you feel like a sardine.  The place looks way cleaner but busy as usual.    I have only tried a handful of items here.  My favorites are either a Carne Asada or Chicken Burrito.  I don't think you can go wrong with Carne Asada but their Chicken Burrito is very good.  I mean, I am a gringo, but their stuff is tasty.    A must for me and my family is an order of strips.  Some just call it chips and salsa with cheese.  I call it almost heaven.  For some reason, you can't stop eating them.  When we have gatherings or parties, we order a large bag cause they are addictive.  You have to order the large bags a day before.  And don't forget the salsa.  The salsa that is homemade and packaged there makes it all better.    Prices seem decent and high for some items but it is worth it.  Very very tasty."}
{"text":"I have heard a ton of good things about elmers. So I was expecting my first Elmers experience to be amazing. I got my food after a while of waiting, which was understandable due to the fact it was busy. I was not upset about this fact. What I was upset about was the fact that once I got my 2 mini chimichangas they were completely frozen in the middle. Not just cold, but frozen. The outer fried part was warm, and the inside tasted very well. But the fact that it was frozen makes me skeptical on going back again."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times with my Husband. We always enjoy it. If you want authentic Mexican food, Elmer's is the place. I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I come here few times a month and love the friendly service and quality of homemade food!"}
{"text":"So worth the drive out of my way! Dining at Elmer's was a life changing experience. At first, the place is not much to look at, though I find many of my favorite spots are that way. I came here after I tried them out at the booth they had at Oktoberfest, where my daughter had an epic bean and cheese burrito. On this visit we had a mini chimmi and taco plate, as well as an enchilada plate, both came with beans and rice. Everything was so delicious.... Totally hit the spot, now I know why this place has been there forever. We will be back, can't wait for my next visit!!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I had bean and cheese burritos last night and we both got sick. My son puked all over his bed twice. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I no longer live in AZ, but wish I did so I could come here more often! We came here with 3 adults and 2 kids, we sat outside since it was such a nice beautiful day before 4pm, we came at a good time, because normally when I visit this place is packed and hard to find somewhere to sit. They brought our food out to our table and it was sooo much food! They had a Carne Burrito with strips on special for $5! Can't pass that up and it is soooo good with lots of filling in it! We also ordered extra strips with sauce, because the sauce is so addicting! I also ordered the enchilada, taco, tostada combo which was allll soooo good, I loved the enchilada sauce and they make fresh fried corn tortillas for the taco which I ordered shredded beef that was very good! Their beans are amazing as well! Thank you Elmers for your great food and service, until we meet again, you will be in my dreams!"}
{"text":"Whenever I drag friends along to return to my Arizona roots, I take them to Elmer's.  The strips are out of this world. If you haven't had them, imagine chips topped with shredded (not melted) cheeses. Plop on some hot sauce (conveniently offered in ketchup bottles for maximum squeezage) for a heavenly combo.  I highly recommend the mini chimichangas with a huge soda.  Oh, and park around the back."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this food at all. A person I work with highly recommended this place for their bean and cheese burritos. Also, there have been some ranting raving reviews on Yelp about how awesome it is. What-everrr!   I ordered the bean and cheese burrito and 2 tacos. When I got my food, the order was totally wrong, with like sausage, and all this other strange stuff. So when I got the correct food I ordered, it was no big thing. The bean burrito was just a bean burrito, and the tortilla was sort of hard to bite into, stale I guess. The tacos were okay, they were the el carbon style like you get at any California taco truck.   I traveled super far to eat here too because it was supposedly so great. Maybe people just aren't used to great Mexican food in AZ. It was just a dumpy little place, kind of looked like an old Taco Johns or taco bell from the early 80's.   Next door, there was a fortune teller/palm reader. I should have stopped by there first to learn how lacking this food was going to be, and then not go.    :)"}
{"text":"Their hot sauce hasn't changed in over a decade, and it's still soooo good! They are usually packed with high schoolers, so it makes good food to go. They are really thoughtful about their to go orders and separate some of the ingredients/toppings so they don't get soggy. The bean and cheese burritos are perfection and the you can't go wrong with their tacos. Another favorite is the breakfast burrito which I've been eating for over ten years and still don't get tired of. Unfortunately their beans and tortillas are cooked in lard, so if you're vegetarian make sure to get vegetarian beans and the corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Definitely going back generous portions great food friendly staff"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem in Chandler.  First off, you have taco in the name...SIGN ME UP!!!   Is a small little restaurant, but don't let he looks fool you. This Mexican place knows how to do simple food right.    Been here a few times and each time I leave more then pleased.  Love the Machaca beef hard tacos. They make their own taco shells not some store bought nonsense.   Rice is great and the pinto beans are absolutely delicious.   They are very rich as you can Tel them make them with lard and/or bacon grease. Mmmmm. :)   They are always super fried my and more than happy to recommend something new each time.    Word the wise though. They are located right across the street from Chandler High so during school days either come before 12 or after 1 otherwise the line is intense."}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times and its pretty good! It has that authentic Mexican flavors. I would say its...similar to Someburros but slightly cheaper. I usually get their chicken tacos and my BF always gets a carne asada burrito. More recently I got a chorizo and potato breakfast burrito which was really good. We don't come here often but mainly because we don't go in that direction often. The only thing I thought was...odd, is their \"nachos\" They don't melt the cheese. They give you chips with raw cheese. The guy at the counter, on our very first visit, gave us some for free to try and swore how everyone loves it. We didn't, it was bland. I'd rather have my cheese melted, and would like some tomatoes, onions, and sour cream on top. Oh well!! We still like this place and will continue to stop by when we're near."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It's right by my house and to be honest, I've never gotten anything but a steak burrito because they are so delicious. I'll try and get a photo next time I'm there."}
{"text":"A place where my niece and nephew eats all their food is a place that deserves 5 stars LOL. I didn't eat, just took them there. It was a bit busy but food came out rather quickly and was nice and hot. I'll update if I actually eat the food"}
{"text":"Really good Chicken tacos, Great prices."}
{"text":"I love their tacos, burritos and everything about this location. The employees are super helpful and deliver with a 100% service.   Food is soooo good!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food spot in chandler. Their salsa is unrevieled and their dishes are consistent and delicious. If you are in the mood for Mexican and are in chandler then Elmer's is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and OH MY talk about a Chandler staple. All the natives to the area seem to know this place from growing up and say its still just as good as it used to be.   I most recently came here after a night shift to grab some breakfast burritos. I ordered one bacon and one ham burrito with the potatoes and cheese. They were absolutely delicious and for less than $5 each (for breakfast burritos) they were huge! I also love their homemade red salsa packs and drown my burritos with them.   In the past I've come here for dinner and enjoyed the carne asada and pastor burritos, again, dowsed in their delicious salsa. If you're really looking to enjoy get the strips with cheese. It's like nachos except they don't melt the cheese - but they are delicious.   Overall, this place is a staple in the Downtown Chandler area. The location is nice, staff are friendly, and the food is absolutely worthwhile. There is a moderate amount of indoor seating but you can also head out to the patio in the front or back if you want to enjoy the weather. Pricing is good and portions are large."}
{"text":"As long as you dont go here when school is in session you are good. Really tasty burritos, friendly service and great hot sauce.  Across the street from the school so lunch is a bad time during the week but weekends are great.  The Green Chili Burro is the bomb."}
{"text":"Elmer's is very greasy and very good.  I just wish they had carnitas and that they stayed open a bit later."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for green chili burritos in the Valley.  Easily the best I have ever experienced.  I haven't had anything else (why stray when you have the best?), but everyone I have taken there has fallen in love with the food.  The restaurant itself is a little nondescript, but easy to find if you remember that it's across from Chandler High and next to a fortune teller.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the atmosphere is definitely very laid back."}
{"text":"Typical Americanized Mexican food place nothing fancy just ok food to fill you up. Indian fried bread is pretty good if they don't burn it .. its more of a tradition for people living in the area or grew up going to chandler high. so don't expect much from this beside some decent food to fill you up."}
{"text":"I can tell by the mixed reviews that I am not the only one who is befuddled by the glowing reviews for the food here.  This reminds me of bland cafeteria Mexican food and the salsa fails to add any sort of flavor.  Are people dedicated to this place simply because of tradition?  This is yet another tiny Mexican mom-and-pop restaurant in the East Valley that has disappointed me.  I didn't know how good I had it before, when I lived northern California.  There you could find the family Mexican restaurants that were inexpensive, delicious, and offered generous portion sizes.  Elmer's fails in the following ways:  1) Not inexpensive. My meal plus drink came to roughly $10 and consisted of a small crunchy taco, a mini chimi, and a mini tostada (meatless).   2) Not delicious. The chimi was the best thing on the plate and it was just \"meh\". The salsa was watery, lacked any discernible heat, and tasted canned.  3) Not generous portons.  I was still hungry after the meal. I would've done better to have gone to Taco Bell.  Sorry Elmer's.  The folks taking my orders out the counter were certainly nice (hence the two stars instead of one). But I just can't eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty reasonable and awesome Mexican food. It was so good I spoke Spanish after wards."}
{"text":"I would agree with everyone that they are good but the only two times I have went they have messed up my order both times :( .... so double check your food when youre getting it to go."}
{"text":"Being from So California, I have been looking for great mexician food. I have finally found it. Elmer's is some of the best I have ever had. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos...grilled, not fried. Bean and cheese burrito (with sauce) was magical. I will crave this place."}
{"text":"I went to try out the breakfast burrito, they say open at 730 but didn't open door til 745. I proceeded to order and was told kitchen wasn't ready and it would be 15 minutes. Seems like their missing out on the high school kids and parents with this.  Food: burrito left more to be desired although it was large it was lacking in flavor. Tortilla was falling apart and super crispy. Not my thing. Salsa was pretty good though! I got eggs, bacon, potatoes, cheese and beans my norm. I should have just got my norm bowl of  cereal."}
{"text":"Best Bean and Cheese Burittos in town. Wonderful mom and pop restaurant that is great every time."}
{"text":"On the fly we came into your restaurant for my birthday and I was beyond pleased. We had no clue what we wanted and the employee behind the counter was so sweet and brought us out a sample of all of the meats. It felt as if we were at home with our family. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My entire family LOVES this place! My parents have been eating here since high school and I grew up with these bean and cheese burritos and strips! Luckily my husband loves it here too :)   Elmer's is a great, yummy part of Chandler! Everyone should try it!"}
{"text":"Our favorite taco place! Luckily we live very close so whenever we get taco cravings we go for Elmer's. Our favorite things to order is 3 taco dinner special, bean & cheese burritos with sauce and tostadas. I normally don't like beans but their beans are sooooo good."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The rice and beans are ok. My favorite item is the grilled fish taco."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Favorite thing on the menu is the Strips. Basically chips with cheese on top, but the chips with the unmelted cheese taste awesome with their sauce."}
{"text":"The only regret I have about this spot is that I didn't know about it sooner.  Had the bean and cheese burrito and chicken tacos and both were amazing.  Looking forward to trying some other items."}
{"text":"Below average Mexican food at best. And $6 for chips and guacamole? Unless you go to Chandler High, skip this place."}
{"text":"After a couple visits to Elmer I decided I really like it even though I always think of elmers glue. I have tried the red and green chilli burritos both delicious but the green is pretty spicy. Tamales, machaca, bean and cheese mini burritos are also good. My kids love the crunchy tacos and Indian fried bread.   They got new seating so I like it even more.   One draw back is if you go there at 2 there's a line out the door because it's across the street from Chandler high and kids are everywhere. Go there before 1 or after 3:30."}
{"text":"Amazing potato tacos! My daughter likes the \"strips\" which are just tortilla chips with unmelted cheese on top but the chips are great. The mini burritos are perfect for lunch, my favorite is the red chile beefthey also have Pepsi products"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the menu items I've tried so far.  Ranking at the top is their green chile burrito, which is beef, not pork, but that's ok.  The taste is there, and is every bit as good as El Zocalo's, just different.  Coming in a close second is their bean and cheese cone.  Yeah, I didn't know what to think when I saw it advertised on their wall, but since it was a 'dollar menu' item, I was down.  It surpassed my wildest expectations.  The 'cone' was a fantastic deep fried flour tortilla.  I got it for my grand daughter, but ended up eating half of it.  Bad Grandpa.  Pulling up in third place was their green chicken mini burro.  Just the right size, and tasted great.  Elmer's is now on my radar when I'm hankering for local Mexican fare.  And 'bean and cheese cone'... we will meet again, and again."}
{"text":"Try one of their breakfast burritos with hot sauce and a large styrofoam cup of HORCHATA rice drank and you won't need to eat a thing the rest of the day!!    OOOOOOH WEEEEEEE!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST hole in the wall place. Get a small strips and cheese and some carne Assad tacos. I'm pretty sure they serve this food in heaven! If you like spicy, try the green chili burro. AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast burritos, love the salsa packets!"}
{"text":"Want to love Elmers, I want to support local businesses and the food is delicious but.... we waited 40 minutes for our to go order and part of the order was wrong.  This has become a reoccurring issue where 2/3's of the order is mouthwatering but at least a 1/3 is wrong or burnt to a crisp.  I want to love Elmers but with the inconsistency will only go when I have time to spare to wait and triple check the order"}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday this week and I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't totally blown away. The service was prompt and friendly and the place was clean and it definitely got busier as I finished my late lunch but compared to a couple other local taco shops I was a little disappointed and the beans in my opinion were quite soupy and bland but the mini chimis were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I grew up in south phoenix and love little hole in the wall Mexican food places. When I looked up best breakfast burritos Elmers came up on the list. We decided to stop in and pick up a breakfast burrito, an egg, chorizo and potato burrito to be exact. My husband ran in and picked it up and we took it home. I was loving it from the first bite. Great texture, tasty chorizo and warm, soft tortilla. Did I mention this sucker was huge and under $5?! I couldn't even finish it and my husband gladly took over. My only complaint is the chorizo isn't as spicy as I would prefer, but my husband who doesn't like much spice, thought it was perfect, as he gave me the thumbs up between bites. We would go back just for that burrito, but I'll venture into the red chili and tamale arena here soon too. Recommend for a fast, friendly, easy, no fuss, delicious, filling burrito!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the customer service was the worst I've ever had and the prices are pretty ridiculous. They charged me $1.50 for a side of guacamole which was maybe 2 ounces at the most. The lady behind the counter was wearing sunglasses the entire time while taking orders and when I tried to order 4 tacos (which I didn't think was so hard) she began to huff and puff and seemed to be overwhelmed. She then proceeded by saying \"shit\" multiple times. In the middle of me ordering she had another employee come and take our order which meant I had to repeat my order. The other employees seemed more concerned about talking with each other about the parties they went to over the weekend instead of serving the customers who were in line. If I was basing it off the food alone, I would go back but given the customer service experience I had, I will probably not be returning."}
{"text":"I brought my friend here for his first time and Tyler at the front was so amazing. He told us all their most popular foods, and gave us free strips to try. He came back to check how the food was (it was great!) and provided all around the best customer service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Elmer's. It was ok. I wasn't wowed or anything.   I had a shredded beef taco. It seemed on the small side. The meat was pretty dry. Nothing special.  I also had a been burrito and I asked for no cheese because I like a side of cheese and then I add just the amount of cheese I like to the inside. Well my burrito had cheese in it anyway.  I've had better burritos. It was ok, but not great.   My side of strips were good. I really did like those.   Also when I picked up my order, my taco was missing so I had to go back and tell them that they had forgotten that.  Good thing I checked before I left.  Overall I just wasn't impressed.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food. I had a mini burro which was actual good. Also the taco and enchiladas was yummy. Cheap price and great food. Best on in the chandler area."}
{"text":"Worth the wait and known in the Phoenix area.  When My wife and I originaly found this place, I told my father in law. BTW he lives 20 miles from this place.  I told him that I just had the best Mexican food in Chandler. He bet me it was \"Elmer's right?\"  I was Dumbfounded that he knew of this place even though he lives so far away.   This place is worth the drive and is known for its quality and tasty food."}
{"text":"Awesome green beef. Spicy.  This is like a real mom n pop mexican joint. Not much of a dine in experience - has a fast food feel to it. Genuine mexican food -- which i think i was taking for granted in the Phoenix area. But i would rate this better than others i tried in the area.  The people are great -- they even let me taste a few of the meats before i chose my tacos. Will go again when i am in phx again."}
{"text":"Amazing bean and cheese burrito, potato tacos and the salsa is just amazing. For the price I can eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I'm an Elmer's fanatic. Yes, I went to Chandler High School, but even though I now live in Los Angeles., I make it a point to visit Elmer's EVERY time I visit Phoenix.    My all-time favorite item is the Machaca Burrito. The best ever!!! It's not like any other Machaca Burrito I've ever had -- this one does not come with eggs, nor is it dry -- the meat is more the consistency of pot roast, stewed in it's own juices w/ onions, and it is so tender, juicy and bursting with flavor. It does tend to get a bit wet/messy, but the flavor is delicious, especially when you add Elmer's sauce.  Also good are the bean n cheese w/sauce, the strips, and the lesser known menu item - \"butter tortilla w/sauce\". It's all about the sauce!  I drown everything in the sauce. (I dream about the sauce).  Viva Elmers!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a Chandler staple. If you are local then you have been here so many times you are not reading this. My wife brought me here 15 years ago and that's it.  We love the beans and since they come in almost everything, everything is worth it."}
{"text":"We were visiting from California, where we are SPOILED by amazing Mexican food... saw the good reviews for this place, and decided to check it out. It's very small inside, but cute. The staff was friendly enough. Service is FAST. I ordered chicken flautas, and the kids had bean and cheese burritos. My daughter loved her burrito. My son loved my flautas more than his burrito (although he ate it)... so I ordered my daughter another burrito, and my son an order of flautas. At some places \"one\" burrito would fill them up, but these ones are not packed as full as some places. Regardless, the pricing is really good... so buying a second isn't a big deal. My husband ordered a burrito, but wanted rice instead of cheese... and, they charged extra for the substitution... he wasn't happy about that (and, it doesn't make much sense). Overall it was okay, and we would be open to trying this place again, if in the area."}
{"text":"After going to LuLu's tacos I feel I was premature with 5 stars here."}
{"text":"Pretty great place, authentic mexican food. They're busy everyday around 6pm which is a good sign. There drinks are extra sweet too like mexican pop. Only complaint is the portions, the two enchiladas I really like are too small for $9."}
{"text":"DoorDash order. I've ordered from them a couple of times. I love the tacos. My boys are not taco fans and they really enjoyed them. Tried the taco salad.... delicious"}
{"text":"I've actually never stepped foot in this place. DoorDash has them as a delivery option when you are at Chandler Regional Hospital, and they offer breakfast burros all day, so Elmer's has provided several meals to my wife and I during our unfortunate recent hospital stays.  Their Bacon and Egg burrito contains a ridiculous amount of bacon, their Chorizo is spicy and flavorful, their salsa is top-notch, and their potatoes are the small, crispy/soft kind that are perfect in burrito form. That is all I've had from there, and it's enough to give them 5 stars, and to plan an actual visit next time I'm in the area (hopefully under better circumstances)."}
{"text":"I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food!!!! Strips and tacos are my favorite but they offer a variety of food for the days I'm not craving tacos so there is always something for everyone!! Added bonus... it's local and family owned and operated!! Can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"This place has the best red chili beef burritos! So yummy! We come here several times a month for a quick dinner and it never disappoints! I"}
{"text":"They put crack in the chips, I think (not really).  I've heard rave reviews from friends and colleagues.  As usual, I live close by, but I just hadn't found the magic moment when the stars aligned to try it out.  Suddenly the time came, and boyfriend and I parked right in front of the place and marched into the crowded restaurant.  We told the cashier that it was our first time.  She answered all of our questions.  I opted for the fish tacos - best price I've seen outside of Mexico!  And damn they're good!  No breading but they are delicious!  The \"strips\" are the best!  I've tried replicating that snack at home, but it's just not the same without their hot sauce.  Yummy!  And what a wonderful, cozy location!  We'll be back again and again.  (We've already been back twice.)"}
{"text":"How about some meat with your cilantro stem tacos? jaysus, the green herb is seriously inexpensive; just the leaves will do.  In a 5 tiered rating system, and with hundreds of Mexican food choices in the valley, the stars begin to get blurry. The trouble is, certain dishes at Elmer's are just okay compared to others.  Rice? Great. Beans? Like El Sol down the street, several whole beans strewn about the refried puree for posterity; no thank you. Tacos al pastor? Pass. Gristly pork and cardboard corn tortillas.  See my list for Mexican food recommendations."}
{"text":"I know I can't be the only one that thought of Elmer's glue when first seeing the name of this place.  Anywho, after a couple of visit to Elmer's, I have decided that Elmer's is a decent little joint.  I like it!   Elmer's Taco's is a cozy fast food restaurant where you order up front, take a seat, and wait for your order number to be called.  The food they serve up here is Sonoran style.  Get your tamales, green chile mini burritos, bean and cheese burritos, machaca, and other delicious food here!  They also serve cheese and strips which are tortilla chips topped with freshly shredded cheese, not melted.  No matter what you order though, don't forget to get their salsa.  Across the street is Chandler High so if you want to beat the rush, come in before 11:30AM or after 1:00PM. The lunchtime rush consists mainly of Chandler High students and boy is it a rush --- the line goes out the door!  So yes, come here for some decent eats!  Food is always hot, the staff are friendly and loud, and the tables are kind of small and cramped so you might want to take it home.  It's a hole-n-the-wall shop that delivers some good eats.  P.S. No glue is served here.  ;P"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were pretty good.  Butter tortillas for the win.  Before I leave Arizona I'm stopping by for more."}
{"text":"This place is such an institution and has always been delicious! Today we went and our experience was so much so that I felt compelled to comment. It has nothing to do with the food, that was fabulous as always! It specifically had to do with the customer service. The woman who was wearing the sunglasses was not very kind, she treated the customers like they were stupid. She may need the glasses for a medical reason which is fine but since you can't see her eyes she should tell you she is ready to take your order. She was talking with another employee so we stood and waited for her to finish and she turned towards us and asked if we were ready already and then we were making custom breakfast burritos and she kept laughing in a way that sounded like she was thinking \"this bitch..\" and she kept saying \"oh boy\" like what we were ordering was going to be the end of the world. For generations my family has always had a great experience at Elmer's but we did not have a great experience today, so sad!"}
{"text":"I work down the street at crust and went here for lun ch break and the Carne asada tacos were off the hook! Definitely recommend  ."}
{"text":"They came to our complex and cooked up tacos.  The street tacos were pretty good!  Can't wait to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"I hav loved tjis place since high school! Had to stop by for dinner with the family. Always good, always fresh, perfect!!! A local favorite!"}
{"text":"I love Elmers Tacos the best in Chandler!! If you have not tried their food you'll must try it!! Me and my family Love it!"}
{"text":"Love you guys to death! It's always my first stop when I get into town. But....Please don't get upset and roll your eyes behind your sunglasses when I ask for extra sauce packets when I had already offered to be charged for extra. I would rather pay than have staff act put out by my request!"}
{"text":"I remember when Elmers use to be on the corner!  The food is the best!  Wonderful Family owned restaurant! My favorite thing there is well... everything!!!!"}
{"text":"First, if you want \"mexican food\" then you need to go to Mexico and get it.  Same with any other ethnic type food.  If you want the real deal go to that country.  Otherwise what you're going to get (in most cases) is an Americanized version of whatever it was you were trying to eat.  Moreover, as you travel east from Cali on I-10 towards Texas, you will come across at least 4 different styles of American Mexican food.  What you like and what you call mexican food probably has a lot to do with were you had it first and where you had it good first.  This brings to Elmers.  Small shop, family owned.  Relatively simple menu.  Pretty low prices.  Lots of homemade stuff...beans,chips, salsa, etc.  Quite frankly, from a quality standpoint this is as good mexican food as you can get anywhere in the greater Phx area.  Going to a chain (Macayos,Garcias, etc) store will not get you better food.  It will get you high prices. It will get you a larger place.  It will probably get you a larger menu selection.  But in the end the food will be substandard in taste an quality to Elmers  Bad thing about Elmers is that it's across the street from the Chandler High.  an as such the volume of people there can be pretty great.  But in the end get a bean and cheese and a red chili burrito and you'll be in business."}
{"text":"This place is the typical hole in the wall Mexican restaurant you will find. The staff was friendly and the chips and salsa were great. The rice and beans were really good but the enchilada sauce the use did not taste very good to me at all, but that's just my opinion. My wife was happy with her food so I assume I just need to try something else. It is a very clean place. But as the other review says, it would be wise not to come during school hours, as the high school is literally across the street."}
{"text":"First time here!! The chicken burrito special with a Chile sauce was to die for.  guacamole & beans in it too!! The staff was incredible!!  Service was amazing.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place and can't get enough of it. This is right across from Chandler High School along AZ Avenue, and during lunch times the line is out the door. I like enchilada-style burritos. They are so yummy, and the drink cups are totally huge. I just wish their hot sauces were better."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Feels americanized. Really only liked the salsa, but even that could have been a lot spicier."}
