{"text":"Just moved to Tempe and wanted some gnocchi (my FAVE) and this seemed to be the only place nearby that serves it, though they call it \"cavatini\" and it's more like little snakes than potato dumplings. As usual for me, I replaced the normal marinara for alfredo; pretty much the most bland alfredo sauce I've ever tasted, but I guess they do advertise it as mild (though there doesn't seem to be any alternative alfredo sauce.) I just threw on salt and it was okay.  The atmosphere is nice; dark Italian restaurant and all that. It's nice enough that you can bring business guests but not too hoity-toity to just have a night out with pals.  I was impressed with the service, and our waitress in particular was very down-to-Earth.   Like other reviewers have said, the place is old but it didn't negatively affect my experience. I also agree with other reviewers that they should do outdoor dining; not only is it nice out there, but it could open up more tables so patrons wouldn't have to wait.  All-in-all good service and atmosphere, decent food."}
{"text":"Riazzi's is what I picture when I think of a small, family owned Italian restaurant. Completely unpretentious, yet has an almost elegant feel. From the moment you walk through the patio of twinkle lights and in the front door you're waited on hand and foot, like a true guest in their \"house\". I don't think my water glass got below 1\" from the rim because the waiter was so attentive! The fresh bread was delicious, and my lasagna was incredible. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal here last night 6-15. I like the atmosphere as it is dark, cozy and comfortable. Our service was top notch. The server was pleasant and came to our table just at the right time and didn't over extend her welcome. I hate it when servers constantly come to our table and ask how everything is. The french bread was soft and warm and the garlic olive oil was rich with garlic and other spices, almost paste like..fantastic. Not like you get at other Italian restaurants where they squirt a little olive oil on a plate and hand you a pepper shaker. The Caesar salads were fresh and crisp. I had the ravioli and it was superb and homemade like the menu said. My husband had the eggplant Parmesan and he said it was delicious as well. The prices are fair and the portions are large just the way we Americans like them! I would have given 5 stars but the outside entrance could have been tidied up a bit."}
{"text":"I had been to Riazzi's with co-workers for the affordable lunch specials, so my husband and I decided to give it a try for dinner. We stopped in at just about 5pm on a Sunday. The decor was lovely for the holidays ~ a big fancy tree up front, lights and decorations throughout, and some classic Christmas tunes. Service was very attentive, and we were provided with our drink selections and dinner bread quickly. For dinner, I ordered the tortelloni with a pesto cream sauce for myself and lasagna for my hubby. Each entree came with either a choice of dinner salad or minestrone soup. The salad with Italian dressing was zippy with lots of vinegar, a few beet slices, a pepperoncini, and a few black olives. The tortelloni were giant with lovely ricotta inside and a quality pesto cream sauce. My husband reported that the lasagna was quite good, with a bit of sweetness to the sauce and some nice sausage. We also liked that the server left a small dish of parmesan cheese for us to sprinkle on top of our dishes.  All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised by the high quality food and recipes as well as the great service at Riazzi's. Parking was easy and ample in the private lot, and I appreciate the outdoor courtyard with fountain that you walk through to enter the restaurant.  Recommended for a mellow and tasty night out with a date, a spouse, or friends!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal after a long day of site seeing.  The food is tasty and the service was good. My husband had the mushroom Gorgonzola  soup special that was delicious.  All our entrees were well prepared and very good.  The atmosphere is fine - but not trendy."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last night... Appetizers were ok, my wife enjoyed her meal but when I ordered the Seafood Diavola everything appeared ok at first. Nicely cooked shrimp and scallops on a bed of spicy marinara sauce. HOWEVER, when I began to dig in the pasta they had hidden half of the muscles under the pasta and they were closed. Serving unopened muscles is a HUGE health risk. It is usually because they are dead at the time of cooking and can be host to a ton of different food born illnesses. I gave them two stars because my wife enjoyed her meal, but hiding the closed muscles under the pasta says that they knew better and showed a complete disregard for the health and safety of their guests."}
{"text":"Have driven by here many times over the years. The outdoor ambience is beautiful at night with the lights.   We brought some out-of-town family here last weekend. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and our server was prompt and thorough.   I ordered the Italian chicken crÃªpe soup which was lovely. Everyone else ordered an array of pastas and said their dinners were wonderful.   Would recommend if you enjoy the authentic old world flavors of Italy. Reminded me of some of the restaurants on my last tour the Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Worst spaghetti and meatballs ever, bar none.  It's like they were trying to make me send it back (it worked).  The pasta was overcooked and tasted like it was out of a pack of ramen; the sauce was reminiscent of Chef Boyardee; and the meatballs were...odd...  On the upside, the service was very prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has adequate food but it is certainly not astounding nor worth the price. The house salad comes with beets that taste canned. It's just not all that great of a place in the food department.  However, I found the staff kind and generally willing to work with you on replacement sides. The restaurant is also quite kid-friendly (though there is no explicit \"kids menu\")."}
{"text":"Great food!  Best Italian food out here.  Veal Marsala is better than any place in New York.  Their chicken stuffed with three cheeses is also delish.  The bread and salads are simple and classic.  This restaurant is a staple of mine, and I've been going here for countless years.  Yes, besides the unique tree growing over the entrance, the decor is bland (1980's Italian style).  I think it makes it feel a little more like if you were eating at Ma's house, and she was stuck in the 80's.  Love this places food!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Decor hasnt been changed since the 80's and the food  tasted the same.  Salad and bread = terrible. You can get way better stuff packaged from a grocery store.   I got the lasagna. First bite was an okay mix of sauce, cheese and sausage. After that there was nothing but cheese and noodles. All the sausage pretty much was gone. It got really heavy tasting pretty quick.   Avoid unless your taste buds are stuck on 1979."}
{"text":"This is our family's \"special occasion\" place.  It is \"old fashioned'  in decor, but the rest of the place is also \"old school\" which translates to professional service, home cooking and a trained bartender who actually knows how to properly mix drinks!  We also enjoys the music selection which is again \"old school\" with Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and others to set the mood.  So, if you're looking for a trendy, \"hipster\" place, this ain't it.  But our family loves it."}
{"text":"I called on a Saturday to place a to go order, not realizing they do not open until 5. A lady answered the phone and was extremely rude. Instead of politely explaining to me that their hours are different on the weekend, she replied \"Well honey we don't open until 5 so ya\" in a rude tone. I have heard about how great the food is but have also heard that the service is lacking. Considering I live across the street from this place I could have become a regular, but they just lost my business forever. I do not appreciate being demeaned."}
{"text":"Riazzi's has consistently raised the bar in service and food quality. My Husband and I come here every year for our anniversary. This most recent time compelled me to write a review. The dining room and bar area were incredibly busy, I know that the staff must have been running around behind the scenes. Not only did our server seem attentive he even suggested a special wine to go with our meal. The food was exceptional, as always. The chicken Valastano is pure, fresh made perfection, the Marsala sauce is balanced and a wonderful complement. I look forward to every visit."}
{"text":"Affordable, delicious food, variety in both dinner and lunch menus. Service is occasionally mediocre, but overall great restaurant!"}
{"text":"First Timer over here!!!! The food was amazing it tasted fresh and had amazing taste and seasonings definitely not commercial or frozen food! The homemade bread was delectable soft and in good portion The chicken Parm had great breading not to thick or thin the sauce was seasoned perfectly The building was clean and quaint very ambient lighting great place for a date or a family dinner. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on 5/13/17 had a 20 minute wait. While waiting I decided to get a drink at the bar. I sat down 10 minutes and the bartender finally decided to help me. I had even told him hello nicely when he glanced in my direction he ignored me. He only had 4 other people at the bar. When he finally decided to help me I asked if he had a menu he looked at me said no and laughed. Then I asked can you make a Margarita he said yes and just looked at me , so I asked what flavors do you have  he said regular plain old  Margarita flavor. That did not sound good so Then I asked can you do a mojito he said no. Then I asked what about a long island he said no, so then I said ok then what drinks can you make he said I can make any drinks with a smirk on his face just looking at me rudely. I looked around the restaurant and realized every guest in there was of the Caucasian decent and I truly believe this man was racist. This is the first time I believe I have ever been discriminated against, this bartender an older Caucasian man did not want to serve me because I am part Mexican. I understand there is still racism around this is just my first time experiencing it. I can not say anything about the food as I did not eat there due to the treatment I received from the bartender. I would have loved to try the food but did not feel like I was welcome there. I am a manager at a hotel I would never treat a guest this way or hire an employee who treated any of my guest this way."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The ranch dressing was good and that was about it!  We waited quite a while before we just seated ourselves and then waited another while to be acknowledged.  I had the fettuccine alfredo.  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was not enjoyable in the least. I didn't even eat more than 1/4th my plate before I finally gave up and decided to just be hungry till dinner."}
{"text":"I've only been to Riazzi's three times, but I've never ordered anything I didn't like. I ordered a small 10\" pizza for grins on my last visit and was very impressed! They also brought my minestrone soup out less than a minute from the time I ordered (the bus boy overheard my order and left to the kitchen before the waiter).   I would give it 5 stars but Riazzi's is just a bit lacking in the atmosphere category."}
{"text":"Excellent local place that's been around for a long time.  Chicken piccata was great as have been all the dishes we've tried here.  The side salad is their wreak spot,  nothing special.  The prices are surprisingly low, you'll spend as much or more at olive garden.  But why would you?! Eat here instead!"}
{"text":"Amazing homemade Italian food! Start out with the fried mushrooms or zucchini! I always order the house salad and angel hair pasta with spicy marinara with mushrooms and peppers! Or the minestrone soup is good too! This place is very quaint!"}
{"text":"True, Riazzi's has been around for a long time... Wonder why???  Cause it's darn good!  That's why!  If you are an eggplant fan you must try the eggplant parm. Wonderful.  And, the service is excellent. Wish I still lived in Tempe, but now I only get to visit when in town on business. Do yourself a favor and go... Service, ambiance and food are all worth it."}
{"text":"I have never been to the restaurant but I order it \"delivery\" through Gruhub. Never disappoints and you can get it delivery!  The menu has a lot of choices, which generally makes me uneasy about the quality. However, most everything has been either decent, great and/or awesome. So some of my favorites, Drunkin' Bread is  yummy and carbsinful! The kalamata salad dressing is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Riazzi's since I was 8 years old and it was in it's original location...quite a long time ago.  It has been a favorite of mine and still is.  Both my husband and I look forward to dinner at this restaurant.  The decor that everyone keeps referring to, is almost exactly as it was in the original location.  I don't think they are interested in updating the \"look\" of the restaurant...it's part of the charm.  The cocktails are always heavily poured - what's not to like about that?  I am a vodka martini drinker and my husband is a bourbon on the rocks guy.  Over the years I have had almost everything on the menu.  I haven't ever been disappointed.  The house dressing is one of my favorites - you have to love red wine vinegar and prefer a dressing that is not oily or heavy.  It's a light red wine vinegarette.  The dressing left on the salad plate is delicious mopped up with the soft, warm bread.  The bread is wonderful!  As I said, it's great for mopping up the leftover dressing as well as the sauce from your entree.  I get eggplant parmigiana, chicken marsala, chicken picatta or ravioli.  Or, I get the anitpasto for one and a bowl of minnestrone soup, or scarpel soup.  The scarpel soup is so good - crepes rolled up with cheese inside in the bottom of the bowl with homemade chicken soup ladled over the top!  My husband always gets the same thing...chicken diavola.  It's got a wonderful spicy marinara sauce on it!  Cannoli for dessert is a must!  It's delicious.  This will always be on my list of go-to favorites!"}
{"text":"Came back after many years...still delicious.  Amazing service, prompt, elegant... lemons for the water without having to ask for them! One course after the other... just like a concert, everything in harmony.  We are impressed, happy and will be back really soon.  Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's graduation dinner.  Made a reservation for 8 o clock and the place was packed on a Friday night (always a good sign).  Service 5 stars: Our waiter was phenomenal. He was kind, patient, and would refill our drinks without us ever having to ask.   Food 3 stars: the complimentary bread is so good! It comes out warm and soft so the butter melts on top. The minestrone soup is delicious. Not too salty.  My seafood diavola (sp?), however, was too salty for my taste. The seafood was good, but the sauce was too salty. My father-in-law got the same dish and cleaned his plate dry. Maybe his had less salt."}
{"text":"Riazzi's has been a part of the neighborhood for as long as I can remember. Whether we were going to eat there for high school dances with friends, birthday parties, a one-on-one dining experience, or takeout; it's been a good experience. Most of the time I get takeout. Highly recommend their Lasagna. Something I don't like is that they put beets with their salads, which I never eat (personal preference). Their bread is fresh daily from a local bakery and service at the bar is always top notch."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. I would describe this establishment as frumpy, dated, and in desperate need of a facelift.  The atmosphere is dark and lost in the early 70's.  The food was below average.  Being from the Northeast, perhaps my expectations were too high, however nothing measured up to even average.  I would not recommend dining here."}
{"text":"I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by the gal at the front desk of our hotel and we couldn't be happier. This is definitely not one of the tourist places, but should be. Nick and Eric (who was training) did a great job serving us. Never missed a beat. My husband had the ravioli combo and loved it. I had the Chicken Marsala with Fettuccini Riazzi (Alfredo sauce) and couldn't stop eating it. I am Italian and this takes a place at the top of my favorites in the USA."}
{"text":"Found this place 2 years ago during a spring training trip. Had a nice meal in the dining room so this year we came back. Seems like the place has fallen on hard times. There was one table occupied in the whole dining room. The hostess said they were closing the dining room and sat us in a booth in the bar area. They must serve great drinks as the bar stools were all full of the local sots. There was only one waiter taking care of the entire room and he really hustled to keep up. I saw a waitress once or twice at the register but she was working the other room? Maybe she needed to help our waiter out.   The food was still great! Warm bread, really tasty Caesar Salads and large entrees. Wife had seafood fettuchine and I had Chicken Parm with spaghetti. Enjoyed our meals.  The furnishings are a bit worn, and it needs some freshening up. There are tables in an outside courtyard but it looks like the area hasn't been cleaned or used in a long time. It reminds me of a place we went to growing up where in the old days there were lines out the door and near the end you could just walk right in and get a table."}
{"text":"I'm only leaving one star cause I can't leave none. This place was weak. I didn't get lost in the sauce. It was too watery. It was almost like you could make this at home with Ragu and some noodles. It just seems like they threw this together. Not impressed. You can't mess up spaghetti and salad. This place succeeded. I could make better food and I can't even cook."}
{"text":"Great place, amazing food, awesome atmosphere, service and fast ethics, our server David was fast and friendly a must go to place warning that bread is good and might fill you up before the main course Bone appitite'"}
{"text":"I like to go here for special occasions with my honey.I LOVE THE PESTO WITH CREAM SAUCE TORTELLONI! It was the first thing I tried and now that's all I order. My honey gets the chicken diablo . Our Kids got the pizza but they thought it \"tasted funny\" - it did not taste like take out, they are kids, what do you want. So, we go there for an evening alone or with friends."}
{"text":"I always make it a point to eat here when I am in Phoenix. My favorite spot is at the bar. The bartender gives great service, with a smile. The baked Penne, with sausage ground up in the sauce is very delicious. The meatballs are spectacular, and the sauce...what can I say about the sauce?  It's what keeps me coming back again and again. When you try the ravioli, see if you can guess the spice that has been added. I think it is very unique!! You can't beat old family recipes that came over with Nona from the old country!! Definitely not a chain restaurant!!"}
{"text":"If you like dated restaurants, with carpet that hasn't been clean in a decade, with an air quality that is stuffy and smelly, with long waits because they don't have enough waiters on the floor, and recipes that use the same 4 ingredients in all their dishes (one of them being LOTS of salt), then Riazzi's is the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"This place is shamelessly affordable and has a great atmosphere, for business, family or friends.   My grandma liked the eggplant parmisan (a full inch of fried eggplant, the best in the valley for sure. I ate half because she couldn't finish it.)  I love the manacotti. Seriously, when are you ever going to make this at home? -For lunch it's $7.95 with a decent sized salad and a full side of spaghetti. Everything comes with free baguette and butter.  My uncle likes the garlic cheese bread.  My mom likes the shrimp thing she always gets.  My friend liked the chicken dish he had.  Inside is a little different than most places. The decor is traditional, the atmosphere is calm and cool, and you can't see or hear the traffic, so it's like getting out of Arizona for a minute.  The only difficult thing is remembering how to spell the name so your friends can find the place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a part of Tempe history.  We lovingly call this the best restaurant in Tempe.  This place does need a serious make over.  It looks tired but that doesn't hurt the food.   The spaghetti and meatballs and the meatball sand which are hands down my favorite items on the menu.  I LOVE their meatballs.  I would say they are the best I have ever tasted outside the east coast.  I prefer their marinara sauce over their meat sauce which I find flavorless.  I have had several of the other entrees but they are not as good."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for dinner with friends. This is a nicely decorated place with a relaxing ambiance that also serves very good food. I ordered the chicken marsala with a vegetable side and its was excellent. The menu has an extensive selection and I would definitely return to try one of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've ever had west of New England. Thoroughly satisfied with everything I ever order from Riazzi's. I highly recommend this restaurant, they do Italian food right."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Italian resaturates in the valley.  Amazing food"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I'm from out of town hoping to enjoy some good Italian food. I ordered their chicken alfrefo knowing that there is no way to mess that up. Well, they did. The entree had no flavor what so ever and the chicken was burnt. I added pepper hoping that it would fix my meal, barely. Then their water tasted as if they got it straight from the river. It was horrible. So I advise if you want some Italian food, don't come here."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. The chicken parmesan was absolutely excellent. The hot bread that was served before the meal was terrific."}
{"text":"My girlfriend summed up everything that was both good and bad about Riazzi's with a single statement: \"It's like Olive Garden, just without any of the things that suck about Olive Garden.\"  The flavors are good, the food well-prepared, but not spectacular. The architecture and the garden are interesting, the decor is flat. The service is good and personable, but not top-of-the-line professional.  It's a neighborhood restaurant with good (somewhat Americanized) Italian dishes served at a consistent quality, with a character that says nothing flashy - reminding you that this really is a satisfying, locally-owned Italian bistro."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years with my in-laws. We always order the Shrimp Scampi with garlic/oil linguine. The shrimp is so plump and wonderfully seasoned with garlic and oil. Very yummy! The salad and house dressing is always fresh and delicious.  I always go to the restaurant with the intention of trying something new, but I just can't resist my original order. Service is good."}
{"text":"Great food, nice waiters, and lovely atmosphere. It's a good place for a date. I like that it's not snooty, but it is nice and romantic. Really good pasta."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3-4 times over the last ten years, and let me tell you- it certainly has not changed in all those years! Good for service and food, bad for the scenery and, well, bathrooms. A mini-remodel would benefit them.   You start with delicious, warm, soft bread. Each entree comes with either a soup or salad. I got the Italian house salad. Crisp produce and the dressing was good.   I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. Holy cow, was it awesome! Good amount of sauce, and the chicken was not over cooked. My chicken came with a side, so I chose the Alfredo, which was great as well. The sauce is slightly thicker than some other Italian restaurants, which I appreciate. I hate thinking the sauce is watered down.  My husband ordered the veal- piscatto, I think (which ever has lemon and wine sauce). The flavors were fantastic- just the right amount of lemon, which was strong but not overwhelming. He chose the angel hair pasta with garlic and olive oil, which I was very jealous of. That flavor was amazing!  My sister is a huge fan of Riazzi's and comes here often. She loves the gnocci and has tried many, many dishes- none of them disappointing.   We should have ordered dessert but didn't. Next time we will!"}
{"text":"I grew up with Riazzi's back on Van Bueren. In the 80s I sold them fresh produce so know their product since I was a child and their ingredients since a young man. Riazzi's is a family restaurant using old family traditions like starting their sauce at daybreak and serving at dinner. Their sauce is completely digestible with no acid burn or issues from many industrial kitchens. Little known secret, perhaps the best pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned Italian food their salad lasagna was excellent when I'm back in az u will see me there lol but really"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary and were very impressed. The food was, dare I say it? Better than my moms and my mom is a fabulous cook. I had the chicken parm with meat sauce and spaghetti my boyfriend had the lasagna and we both we very happy! Great place for anniversaries and getting great food!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, I thought perhaps I would weigh in - they seem to be all over the place.  The critics are correct that the decor seems dated.  To me, having grown up back east with this very sort of restaurant, it was charming.  The restaurant is particularly enjoyable to visit at night, when they turn on the lights in the garden.    I enjoy the layout of the dining room, although I agree it is a 'cooler' experience to eat in the bar.  I guess some people could be offended that the staff sit down and eat in the bar when it is slow, but I'm not one of those people - I think it adds to the charm.    I had a very late lunch yesterday - around 3 - thanks to an appointment that went on forever.  So we ended up heading to Riazzi's for a late dinner, around 8:30.  At that time of the evening, the dining room was closed., so we sat in the bar.  Their service is truly one of the strengths of this restaurant.  On this night, they were unusually attentive - even for them. The waters came out immediately upon sitting down, then they took your drink order - as it should be. Neither my iced tea or water ever got below half a glass.  This is something I occasionally find annoying at places where the staff draws a lot of attention to itself when they refill drinks - particularly when it interrupts the flow of conversation.  Not at Riazzi's - they are attentive but unobstrusive.    Their bread is my favorite restaurant bread in the Valley - hands down. It is actually better than the Italian bread I grew up eating back east in Hartford, New York, Boston and Providence.  It's so good that I wish they had loaves available.  You have to possess a lot of discipline not to fill up on the bread.  The salad is as others have described it - traditional, but fresh.    My favorite item on the menu is now listed under pizzas and described as a Spinach Pie.  This used to be listed under appetizers as the Grass Pie, but if you order a Grass Pie, they'll still know what you mean.  It is a cheeseless pizza with spinach and arrabiata sauce.  Confession:  I love all things arrabiata. But this combination here is perfect.  For about 1.50 (I can't recall the exact figure), they'll add mozzarella to it, but I've never done that because it is perfect as it.    They bring you a healthy amount of tasty parmesan cheese, so you can always throw that on the Spinach Pie.  So, I had that. Outstanding as usual. My wife ordered the Penne Primavera, which was very good.  Last time I was there with my daughter, she had the penne with garlic and oil, which I thought was just superb.  Simple, but perfect for a garlic fan like me.  I have a feeling most folks skip over such an entree in favor of something more elaborate, but I recommend it.    We didn't have an appetizer, and even though I wouldn't describe the portions as enormous, they were generous and neither of us could finish our entrees.  Is Riazzi's going to be sexy for the young, hip crowd?  Probably not, although it is romantic at night with their lights and sunken/elevated dining room, and has the 'cool' factor of the bar.  It totally hit my 'nostalgic for the east-coast Italian restaurant' needs.    I just wish the service at most modestly-priced Valley eateries approached Riazzi's. You can get spoiled with the bread and service over here."}
{"text":"So the last time I was here was July 2006 and now I know why.  The place itself is cute in a very dated way.  The service was very good but the food is nothing to rave about at all.  We ordered a house salad that came out almost as a soup because of how much dressing was on it, same went for the Chicken Marsala, drowned in sauce you had to search for the chicken.  Ordered a side of penne with oil and garlic, there was so much garlic you could keep vampires away for a lifetime, deeming it inedible, and the pasta was not cooked well either to boot.  The others we dined with seemed to like their food but all complained about things drowning in sauces and lack of real flavors.  With so many options in Tempe and the surrounding area, just go somewhere else for Italian food."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed the food and service. The place could use a, \"refresh and update\" but I enjoyed it overall. The food alone was worth it. The desserts were homemade and spectacular."}
{"text":"i've been here several times over the years and i have to say this is one of my favorite italian restaurants ever. the servers are friendly and the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"30 min wait for takeout on a Monday night? No thanks. Especially after I had to call 3 times to get ahold of someone, then give my complete order to two different people."}
{"text":"The food was good. It didn't knock my socks off. I may go again. But it was clean and the service was acceptable."}
{"text":"I have eaten here regularly since the 80's the food is consistent and great. The lunch menu and dinner menu offer a good selection at really reasonable prices. Nothing beats the bleu cheese salad dressing and the very cold salad it is served on. Sometimes with a peperchini and others with a pickled beet. Try the chicken parmesan or the orange roughy. They are both outstanding!"}
{"text":"Absolutely not! The service was unforgivably bad. I will be contacting the owner. Allow me to regale you about my afternoon at Riazzi's. I'd like to preface this with the fact that we live in the area, I've loved this place and been a patron for YEARS. I walk into Riazzi's today for lunch, I haven't been there for lunch, and I won't be going back. Let's set the scene: there are four, count 'em, four other people in the restaurants. I make a total of three tables. This is by no means a busy section for a server. This is something any server could do with their eyes closed. The server seems overwhelmed. After he tells me to seat myself, I'm ignored for approximately five minutes. When I finally go get myself a wine list, he tells me I have a dinner menu, I have to ask for a wine list. This takes more time, when he returns I ask if they're a full bar, the server says yes. I order a very cold slightly dirty martini with olives. Simple. Literally any restaurant or bar in the valley, and frankly, in the entire world, should be able to make this drink. The server brings out the drink. It's brown. They've used sweet vermouth. In a dirty martini. The server really didn't know what's wrong, so I explain that this is not how a dirty martini is served. He apologizes, and tells me that he will correct this cocktail conundrum. A rather angry man puts a fresh martini in front of me. This is when all hell breaks loose. He explains to me, angrily, that HE prefers to drink HIS dirty martini's with sweet vermouth. I am flabbergasted, I seriously consider correcting him, but I choose to leave it at that. I'm studying for my Som, have worked in the industry for years, and have enough sense to know that not only is it inappropriate to become hostile with a guest, but it is also inappropriate to let your own warped personal preferences influence the way you make a classic cocktail. My waiter comes back, does not take my order, and I ask to speak to a manager. Eric, the hostile bar tender comes back, oh joy! Just the person I wanted to see! NOT! The fact that the restaurant is silent and the server clearly had to know that Eric and I had just had a very awkward exchange and didn't have enough social graces or common sense to know that I should NEVER have had to deal with that person again is shocking.This company has a very clear staffing issue. But then, it gets worse! Eric is back, and he is furious. He tells me to \"Cut the BS\" I am shocked that he had the audacity to CURSE at a guest! I would LITERALLY never, and have never spoken to a guest, or frankly a stranger that way in my entire life. It was verbal abuse and it is not okay! I told him that he needed to watch his language, I explained the proper way to make a martini, what constitutes proper guest service, and with that, I was done. I wasn't going to be spoken to or treated that way by anyone, but especially not by some random person working in a relic of what used to be a great restaurant. It was humiliating to be treated this way, and made worse by the fact that more people had entered the restaurant. Servers and bar tenders are reliant on their tips for money, I tip obscenely well. Not today, Eric! After this experience, I feel like Riazzi's owes me money. Shame on you, Eric. Eric had the opportunity to better himself, his service, and to learn something today. Instead, he chose to behave contemptibly. Eric could really use an etiquette lesson, learn a thing or two about service, and cocktail making. Shame on you Riazzi's, today you became the worst restaurant in Tempe. I will be posting this to all social media platforms, and furthermore, it should be noted that I have excellent relationships with some of the most notable food critics in the valley. This will be made well known amongst my peers in the writing community. I'd leave zero stars if it were a possibility. I really would."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at Riazzi's years ago when I lived in Tempe.  I'm back in Tempe now and I was looking forward to being close to one of my favorite restaurants.  My, how things have changed.    The food is still ok, but things are a bit dated.  The wine list is so-so, and the stemware is thick and horrible banquet quality.  Don't dare ask for a teaspoon, they don't exist here for some reason.  The servers I've had seem competent and the hostess is always a treat, but the bussers are useless and the manager struts around like he thinks he's Burt Reynolds.  All I've ever seen him do is sit at the bar, watch TV, and BS with the bartender.  Speaking of the bartender, if you sit down at the bar expect to be ignored unless you're a regular.  Also expect to see the bartender BS with all the male servers but berate the female servers and bussers for anything and every thing, in front of patrons.  Speaking of \"in front of patrons,\" I was at lunch there recently when two employees had an altercation in the bar.  My whole table actually witnessed a male employee punch the wall next to a female employee after screaming at her!  I am NOT making this up...  I used to be close with the old owners (no idea who owns the place now), and this breaks my heart."}
{"text":"Excellent and quick service. Wonderful ambiance. I took my wife here for Valentine's Day and the setting was just right. The food was pretty tasty but I would have gotten the regular lasagna instead of the spinach lasagna. Overall great place. I think I'll come bake for lunch when the prices are cheaper."}
{"text":"Yay for local business! I'm always craving Italian food and the chains around here are not impressive. I have a new favorite.  For my first visit I stuck with a standard, Fettuccine Riazzi with Grilled Chicken.  Wonderful. The grilled chicken was a smidgen too peppery for my taste but the cheese sauce did a great job of making it all better. Next time I want to try something a little more adventuresome.  My only real problem was with the salad. It was smothered in dressing and inedible. In this day with everyone watching what they eat, isn't dressing on the side the norm? I'll have to remember to ask for it that way next time.  Maybe I visited on an off night (Tuesday) because the place was almost empty. Therefore the service was quick and attentive. I could tell by the conversations around me that most of the customers were regulars and the staff well-liked. That's always a good sign.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. The fried calamari  and steamed clams were great for appetizers.We probably would've enjoyed  place more, but our Grandson was with us and wasn't cooperating. Hard to fully enjoy your meal when you're worried about disturbing other diners. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time at Riazzi's tonight. Had a celebration for 20 people. Table was ready as promised. I was first to arrive but waiter greeted me quickly and offered to take my drink order. There were already 8-10 parties seated at 5:30 PM -good start.   As guests arrived, same good service was offered.   Lots of different dishes ordered but I'll stick with what my family ordered. My wife sampled the antipasto salad and steamed mussels as an entree. Our daughter ordered from the gluten free menu and had the shrimp scampi with GF penne pasta and salad. Her husband ordered chicken piccata which came with a side of pasta and salad. Our youngest daughter ordered the spinach lasagne and I had the house special tortellini Riazzi pesto with a salad.   The mussels were tender, tasty and hot. There were plenty of them (about 18) too. The GF dish - shrimp scampi and penne, came with gluten ingredients. I don't know if the waiter/cook got confused by taking 20 orders or not, but there was only one GF order for the party. She didn't get to eat anything. Our waiter was so busy keeping up with everything that he didn't even offer a redo until the table was nearly cleared. The spinach lasagne was huge, plenty of sauce and cheese. The piccata was done right, with lots of capers. The side pasta was rather boring tho. My tortellini was outstanding and I recommend it tremendously. Over a dozen big, tender pillows in a rich, creamy pesto sauce.   I would have liked to give Riazzi's five stars but you can't mess with allergies. I would suggest he circle the GF order on the ticket, highlight it is something!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner New Year's Eve with friends and had a great meal.   The Caesar salads to start were always good and just the right size. The entrees that we selected covered a generous portion of sausage & peppers, Lasagna, Shrimp Scampi (which as described are large), and my favorite, Veal Piccata. All were prepared perfectly and appropriately spiced. Accompanying pasta and various sauces were perfectly cooked.  The service was the same \"relaxed\" approach that I've received over the last several visits - despite a full restaurant with several large groups. No issue here, just a different experience than the more commercial chain restaurants. Just a great home-style family experience."}
{"text":"Riazzi's was a place I had wanted to go for my birthday for over a year. When I finally went there, I loved it aside from the prices. The food was fantastic, the patio was gorgeous, the staff was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was perfect. It had a mom and pop feel and allowed me to feel relaxed and family oriented. I really enjoyed having my family experience Riazzi's with me! All around fantastic experience aside from the prices. The prices were a little steep for the amount of the food one received. Other than that this place was amazing."}
{"text":"Had not been here for about six years, but decided to try dinner here again.  Cocktails are generous and very affordable.  Dinner prices are reasonable, but food is mediocre at best.  IMO, food quality and taste is not as good as before.  I ordered the large antipasto appetizer platter and was disappointed.  Cheese was like sandwich cheese slices.  Meats were like prepackaged sandwich meat.  The so-called prosciutto was like sliced deli ham, but the olives and marinated mushrooms were OK....would have liked to pay more for better quality ingredients.  My sausage and peppers were not tasty.  Bland sausage; more like hillshire farm kielbasa instead of spicy Italian sausage, and just peppers, no onions -- and just sautÃ©ed in olive oil, no marinara sauce.  My friend's fried raviolis were big and looked good, but I did not taste it.  But prices are cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.  Service was acceptable, but hostess was sort of ditsy."}
{"text":"50-State traveler experience here, and I always stay in nearby hotels so I can dine at this historic location. The awesome bartender Chris has worked here for 40-years... Yes, 40!"}
{"text":"Service was nice and our server was attentive, but the pasta was alright at best--drowning in sauce, kinda mushy, and the tortelloni seemed to be the frozen kind. The bread was good and the salad was decent, but I'm not sure I'll be back for it. The interior also reminded me of my great grandparents' house."}
{"text":"The food's a notch above Olive Garden and about twice the price. The decor is seriously outdated, very 1983. Service is hit or miss, but they always manage to pull it off when it's important. I had a friend recovering from surgery who was craving cannoli with her entree and so we ordered a cannoli and a tiramisu for our to-go desserts. After placing our order by phone (at around 8:30 at night), they called us back to tell us they were out of cannoli, would two tiramisus be okay? We were REALLY disappointed, but it happens. When I went to pick up our food, the host said that the chef had decided to make a FRESH cannoli for us, and it was literally the best thing I ever ate. That was my first trip to Riazzi's and their efforts to make a customer happy have ensured that I'll be back for another trip! (edited to fix a typo)"}
{"text":"Went again (a friend from out of town *really* wanted to go.  This time I ordered the tortellini with pesto cream sauce after reading reviews that it was good.  It was.  I really liked it.  However, it did not reheat well so you must try not to eat to much bread and salad before the entree arrives.  Ordered a large pizza for my children and they did not like it.  After eating bowls full of bread and butter before it arriving they were also not hungry.  If I am ever in a situation to eat here again I would try very hard not to bring the children with."}
{"text":"I agree with the posted comments about the dÃ©cor.  The owners are obviously making money and have been for years; why not invest a little in an atmosphere that matches the food and prices (which are good and reasonable, respectively)?  This decor more resembles what you would find in a backwater western town.  Also, a quick tip for the hostess: at the nicer establishments, the hostess doesn't just toss the menus on the table and tell the customers that the waitress will be right with them; she waits for the customers to seat themselves and politely hands them the menu."}
{"text":"I heard great things from others. I was not impressed. Service moved at a glacial Pace, food came out lukewarm to cold. Staff was stressed and underprepared for the Sunday dinner crowd. I will probably never be back."}
{"text":"Been going to Riazzi's for years. Great neighborhood spot. Ravioli is excellent and their blue cheese dressing is amazing. Totally fresh, homemade and well addicting! We go just for the blue cheese dressing sometimes! Ask for the herbed olive oil with bread. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Haven't been in years.  I was amazed that although It's been years since my last visit here, not much has changed.   The massive ficus tree at the entry looked as good as ever and I noticed that the landscaping surrounding the building were nearly perfect. I also noticed the patio was under utilized, just a bunch of plastic patio furniture scattered about. This might be my only beef with this place. They should fix it up, cover and set those tables, and add some shimmering lights. It might have been so because it was a Monday night but I don't remember the patio ever being used to its amazing potential.  We were greeted promptly and with a warm friendly welcome. It felt so inviting like we come every week. A nice old school booth was camp for the next hour or so. Mature service was prompt friendly, and professional, Its a nice change from the 19 year olds in Scottsdale that don't care about what they are doing or serving.   as far as the food goes everything started with some fresh baked bread and foil wrapped butters. soup and salads preceded main dishes and there they were, the sliced canned beets and as expected a pool of a delicious tangy red wine Italian dressing topped by Ice berg olives and those slice beets. Gratefully some things never change!  Main dishes included Stuffed eggplant that was covered with a half pound of mozzarella and swimming in marinara, it smelt delicious! My buddy had a $15.00 pizza after adding 3 toppings, $15 10 inch pies are becoming the norm around town so it didn't seem too out of line and 1/3 of that pizza made its way home for a snack later. My pasta dish was called Half and Half and included delicious beef ravioli and spaghetti with meat sauce, the sauce was as good as my own, and the pasta was cooked to absolute perfection.  Deserts were declined, and our garden party soon came to an end. Thank you's and good bye's came from all directions and that's old school at its best!!!  Riazzi's is that touch of nostalgia and the part of Tempe you always want to remember after so much around town is building up, modernizing and going corporate."}
{"text":"While living in the Valley for good Italian food, I tripped over this jewel through yelp. I don't see how this place could be considered bad seeing how fresh everything tasted. Salty? Perhaps too much fresh grated cheese with your food (which you get to spoon in yourself).   The place is dated, but if the food is good, who cares. My wife got the pesto with cream sauce tortellini while I went with the gnocchi. They were both beautiful things. The tortellini was marvelous with that cream sauce; I was fighting myself from mopping up a bit with some bread. The gnocchi was excellent (though I haven't really had much out there, so i'm not a real pro at spotting the best of the best) and the meatballs...absolutely stellar. They were soft with a small hit of spice while keeping with the meaty texture.  After this, we were feeling satisfied. Oh right, dessert! I had to have the canoli while my wife went with the tiramisu. My wife hates canolis, but really liked theirs. The tiramisu? Best she ever tasted. My only complaint is that they're a little expensive, but damn they tasted good.  Are there better Italian places? I don't know yet, but I do know that this place is great. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Family has been coming to Riazzis for over 40 years, having to wait for up to 2 hours in the old days on Van Buren after driving over an hour.  This is authentic home made family recipes.  We now live in North Carolina and it is always the first stop when we come to town.  The food is incredible, if you've never had their fried ravioli, the cheese are a must have.  Large dollop of cheese in a flakey dough and fried. They set the bar on them.  No place has anything as good, or as big. No skimpy frozen ravioli here.  Flew in to town today, see them for dinner tonight.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"The service was great--that is, once we were seated.  The place was packed, and we were told the wait would be 45 min to an hour.  Seeing that home was less than a mile away, rather than stand around, we decided it would make more sense to leave for a bit and come back.  We returned to find out our name was called a half hour earlier, and the hostess, clearly agitated that we weren't there, was persistent about having us put our name back on the waiting list, forcing us to wait again.  It wasn't until a manager was brought over that the situation was quickly remedied and we were immediately seated.  I don't know if anyone spit in our food because of that, but my dish sure tasted delicious."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never did a review on this place. I had such high hopes and my hopes were crushed after eating here for the first time. The restaurant looks really pretty from the outside. However, upon entering, the atmosphere is really old and dated. They definitely need to put in new carpet and make a few other updates. We were sat fairly close to a drink dispenser that had broke and was making a horrible noise as workers scrambled to get it under control. In any event, I opted to order the cannelloni (one of my favorite Italian dishes if made right, I will order it if its on the menu) and the hubby ordered the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo. We both had a salad with their house Italian dressing. From what I can remember, the bread was simply ok, didn't taste fresh baked by any means. Oh we did order the bruschetta before dinner and it was actually very good, one of the better bruschetta's Ive had. Our meal was a different story. The salad was ok, a decent mix of greens with vegetables, however, I didn't care for the dressing. I am not a huge fan of Italian dressing and prefer ranch. I believe their salad came standard with the Italian dressing though. The hubbys marsala came and was very puny and the alfredo was not that great. In our opinion, it takes a serious talent to make good alfredo sauce that is the perfect consistency and thickness and this was too runny for his liking. My cannelloni was drowned a rose sauce and was nothing memorable. It also was not that big of a portion. Service was decent from what I remember though. All in all, I am not sure why this place gets so much praise. It was simply ok in my book although a little run down and old. Would I go here again? Maybe if someone else wanted to go. Otherwise, I will not waste my time and stick to truly good Italian food at Rigatonies. Now that is my kind of place!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for years now and we finally made it last night!  Good neighborhood Italian Restaurant.  The Linguini and Clams was suggested, so, that's what I tried.  My son and I shared it since they didn't have a children's menu.  I was informed that they did have half portions.   My little pasta monster enjoyed it.  I make mine with fresh herbs as to why I was a little disappointed.  It was still tasty.  My husband had the Turkey and Beef Canneloni.  That one was a little strange...in taste and texture.  Not a fan.  The antipasto salad was good.  I find it strange how restaurants would serve half of the salad in bite size pieces and the rest you half to cut with a knife like the onions still in rings..  Overall, it's a good place for an inexpesive Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe we arrived at the wrong time(1:30pm). The place wasnt crowded at all but they told us the dining hall was closed. Almost implying: please go away. After a few minutes waiting they begrudgingly pushed two circular tables together for us, making an awkward sitting arrangement. We had three separate waiters throughout the meal. None of which, paid us much attention. The food took about 30 minutes to arrive when all we ordered was pasta. The food was good though. Not sure I'll return on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Have been going to Riazzi's for 40+ years (back in the VanBuren days) and they have always treated us and been like family dining. The atmosphere is for long multi course dinners with good conversation. Their Bruschetta is the best in town. I love the spaghetti and meatballs but can recommend just about anything on the menu. The one disappointment I have is they took the Cannelloni off the menu :(   Be sure and treat yourselves to their custom handmade Spumoni after dinner."}
{"text":"First time going there, although the food was good, but not great. The decor was absolutely hilarious! Interior and exterior. Really $6 plastic chairs?  Revamp the place or I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to a local Italian restaurant, but I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I ordered the Chicken Marsala. It was tasteless, salty, the chicken was salty and there was about 3 1/2 slices of mushrooms. The sauce tasted like cheap white wine and  1lb of salt. The server dropped if off and didn't come back for 15min. After I told her it was inedible, she asked if I wanted anything else and I said no. She brought the check and it was still on the bill! She then told me since there was nothing wrong with it she could not take it off the bill. I asked to speak to the manager, she went to get him, then I saw her crumble up the bill and then she dropped it off with out the dish. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The best part of the meal was the Andy's mint at the end."}
{"text":"We were here on Tues. March 5, 2013 a party of six, with reservations. We all enjoyed the ambience, food, wine and service. Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers of mussels and then their entree.  Not one of us had room for dessert .  The service was friendly and professional with a fresh basket of bread and butter delivered to our table before it was needed. Would highly recommend dining here to anyone and will dine here again when back in Tempe, Az."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our friends birthday dinner. The food wasn't that great and the salad looked like it was from one of those salad bags that you can get at a grocery store. Our waiter was very nice, but the food wasn't so great. I think Olive Garden is better than this."}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving decent italian food that is not the dreaded Olive Garden, we usually come here. The lunch specials are awesome and priced just right. I LOVE their lasagna, the sauce is homemade and to die for! But boy howdy bring your tums... I agree with some other reviews, sit in the bar area, much more chill vibe."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal to me when it comes to Italian food. The veal Marsala is my favorite, but their seafood diavolo dish, is truly one of the best versions I've ever had, even in philly and NYC. It's a red sauce linguine with prawns, scallops, and mussels. The bread is homemade, and really a stand out too. The tomato sauce is better than the marinara FYI."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Ridiculously cheap so so Italian food. Very old school and needs a renovation 20 years ago. Not bad if you just want some cheap Chianti and pasta."}
{"text":"Tucked in restaurant in Tempe always passed by until now. Ordered their Half & half plate ravioli and spaghetti with meat sauce. It was good but not great. The ravioli tasted too soft as if under cooked. The inside meat was well but the outside pasta taste was to soft and needed more time or baked would of been better. The sauce tasted homemade and the portion serving was enough.  The ambiance inside reminds me of a mob movie and they do play great classics like Frank Sinatra and Italian classics.  I was not asked for refills on drinks which is always a pet peeve of mine even if I am not thirsty. It just makes me know that my waiter is attentive and not just trying to stuff my mouth till the check comes out.  Approve for now, may need another visit for another taste of different plate."}
{"text":"I visited Riazzi's Italian Garden as part of an ASU group to hear a business speaker. We had a fairly large group of probably around 25 people, so it was expected that service might be slow. Even still, it was ridiculous. The appetizers were out within 10-20 minutes, but our soups, salads, and main entrees did not come out for over an hour after we ordered.   The food was less than appetizing as well. The appetizers were all pretty decent. My group ordered calamari, bruschetta, and fried ravioli. Each of them were full of flavor and had great textures.  The regular Italian salad I got had an excess amount of dressing. It had an overpowering acidic taste to it.  I also ordered chicken marsala and spaghetti with marinara sauce as a side. The chicken marsala was overly sweet, while the marinara was just disappointing. It had little flavor and did not seem very fresh. I will say that the chicken was very tender though.  All and all, I will not be visiting again in the future. I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Our faith has been restored in Riazzi's! at least temporarily! Ok...so we gave it another try for our anniversary.  Eric our server and the busser were obviously covering more than their fair share of customers, yet gave exceptional service! We were in want for nothing! They both went above an beyond and made the experience better than we had even hoped for, & the food was GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Server was overwhelmed and overworked. One server for an entire room. Hire some help and don't be cheap. I won't be back. As for the food, not that great."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't understand how this place has been around so long.  I definitely appreciate a good mom and pops restaurant, and I so badly wanted to love it here.  The patio is gorgeous but for some reason you can't dine out there.  The decor is so incredibly outdated and feels like you should only be there if you're over 60.  The cocktails were nicely poured but the wine was pretty mediocre.  My friend and I shared two dishes, one was the pesto tortellini, which was fabulous, and the other was the beef ravioli.  The ravioli seriously tasted like the pureed meat in chef boyardee from the can.  Just to make sure I wasn't crazy I made everyone at the table taste it, and they all agreed it was not edible.  I did complain and they took it off the bill.  I just can't justify spending my money here because it's so lackluster.    To each their own."}
{"text":"I generally will not write a review but when it comes to this time around I feel compelled to. I went to Riazzi's last night because my mother was in town and wanted a nice dinner and my wife and I suggested Riazzi's my wife has been coming here for years with her family (her parents even have had big anniversary dinners here) it was only my second time. Well the service to start with was OK not great not bad just OK the salads were ehh way to much vinegar in the dressing then we got our entrees I got Gnocchi which was a childhood favorite of mine (Grandpa amazing cook) and my wife got the Lasagna my first bite of mine all I could taste was salt just heavy salt in the sauce and my wife could not stand her dish either she couldn't put a finger on why just did not enjoy and only ate half. Well I did get through my meal I was hungry the waiter was nowhere to be found to share any displeasure well about fifteen minutes after all of us were done a bus boy took our dishes and we had asked for the check well twenty minutes passed and we finally saw our waiter and reiterated we had asked for check some time ago he just turned around to retrieve it no apology just handed it over and took credit card. My wife and I discussed on way home that this place was going down hill and would not go to again we even suggested this could be a candidate for a kitchen nightmare episode, well I had figured I would not think of my experience again at least for a while but to my dismay I am now up at 3:00 am writing this because I am not feeling well and it is not pretty  Shame on you Riazzi's for putting out a poor experience"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Riazzi's for more than 20 years.  Every time we go the services is good, but the food is fantastic.  If I have a person in town, Riazzi's is on top of my list as a place to take them. Their meat sauce is terrific.  My wife just love their Fetticini Riazzi.  I recently (yes, after all those years) tried their pizza and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I had just called because I wanted to do a take out order to get lunch while I was at work. At first the woman on the phone seemed a little aggrevated with all my questions I was asking, but it was simply because she had a bunch of people walk in at the same time, she politely asked me to call back and which I did.  She answered all my questions and since I'm a plane Jane as it is I just had ordered the Penne Noodles with Marinara. Since I was ordering for my boyfriend who is Vegan she continued to impress me with the news that their marinara had NO cheese in it. Which was good and meant he could eat it too. So Vegans! You can eat here with the noodles and sauce! Add it to your list.  It was done quickly and the exterior and interior was very adorable. I wish I had the chance to sit down and experience more of it.   Considering it was lunch menu it was very inexpensive and delicious! It came with slices of bread which is always a plus!  I would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"I have to say I friggin' love this little Mom and Pop Italian place...and especially around the holidays. They really 'desk the halls' and particularly in the bar area (which is really large and has lots of tables as it has not changed since the \"smoking section' era.)  After an event in downtown Tempe a group of 7 of us decided to go here for pasta last Sunday evening. Although there was a wait (for 8 people that is expected) in an almost empty restaurant, we were seated in the bar (yay!) and Andrew our waiter come over to tell us \"I don't have much to say except there are no specials tonight, and the vegetable of the day is green beans.\" Don't you love it? And he was witty and attentive the whole evening!  Most of us had the famous spaghetti and meatballs and the salad with their homemade blue cheese dressing....the yummiest! One person tried the lasagna and one the pizza, and both looked fabulous. And we topped it off with a bottle of their house (Ruffino) Chianti..well, actually 3 bottles. We stayed for a couple hours just eating, talking and laughing and enjoying the holiday atmosphere. It was a really lovely evening. Thanks Riazzi's....."}
{"text":"Me and My girlfriend Jessica come here all the time. House made raviollis and their Egg parm is always a safe bet."}
{"text":"Upon entering Riazzi's, Kevin and I were unsure if we had stepped into an Italian restaurant or a nursing home. The patterns on the carpet and booths were horrifyingly dated, and the place was dingy and dark. The only thing that kept me from whole heartedly believing that we were visiting my great grandmother's home was the waiters/waitresses/bus boys playing Rhianna full blast in the kitchen as they talked loudly about their personal lives and friend drama and hair cuts. Food was fine. Nothing to write home about. But the atmosphere, oh gosh. Never again."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Riazzi's for years - even when they were on Van Buren many moons ago. The Eggplant Parmigiana & gnocchi  - always the same, (2 of our favorite dishes), salads fresh & love the touch of the added beet. The service has always been great & the restaurant is clean & old school.  Great long time Mom & Pop business that we will continue to dine at."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Pheonix. I have been here many times and it is always perfect. I am from the east coast and desperately miss the Italian restaurants. This place ( and the cavatelli ) reminds me of home. The service is outstanding, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is spot on. It is perfect for a date night or a family dinner. Highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Like someone else said...you really need to expect Riazzi's to be what it is to enjoy it. Is this place outdated? Yes. Is the salad a little meh? Yes. And what's the deal with their ranch? It is SO watery. But their bread is awesome! And the Veal Piccata is to DIE FOR. Im somewhat of a Piccata freak considering I make it for dinner frequently and order it almost every time I go to an Italian place (chicken or veal). I have not had a better Veal Piccatta anywhere. So for that I will keep coming here when I am in the mood for a delicious Veal Piccata."}
{"text":"I finally went to this place after driving by it for 8 years.  I would always see it and say to myself \"I need to go there one time,\" but never actually following through.  After reading some quality reviews on here we decided to bring some family there for a graduation dinner.    We ordered some Mussels to start and those were very good.  They were tender and the sauce was good.  We also had the Caprese Salad to share amongst the 4 of us.  I was pretty full after the appetizers so the girlfriend and I split the Veal Piccata.  It too was quite tasty.  The entrance is very cool with the very large and old Ficus tree that had holiday lights woven through it.  Aside from some very loud, obnoxious and drunk guidos/meatheads that were there, it was a very enjoyable meal.  Bonus points for giving me a healthy serving of Sapphire on the rocks.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a cozy Italian restaurant near Arizona State University.  The prices are reasonable for those of us on a budget.  The food isn't spectacular, but it's what you might expect from a run-of-the-mill Italian restaurant.  The service is usually very good. Overall, a good place to go if you're looking for Italian that's not Old Spaghetti or Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Riazzi's for many years, and sad to say, the food is not what it used to be. I went with a party of 20, and even though they knew we were coming with plenty of advanced notice, they were overwhelmed. Service aside, the food just wasn't on point. Red sauces were bland, and seemed in short supply. I asked for Pasta Carbonara, and it was so salty as to be virtually inedible. There was so much pancetta in it that it overwhelmed completely the rest of the dish. One of our party had pizza, and found it to be just ordinary. Most of the dishes were not enjoyed with the one exception of the calamari, which was perfectly fried. I realize that times are hard all over, but the temperature in the restaurant was unbelievably warm, and members of our party kept having to get up and go outside to cool off.  I hope they go back to the fine food they used to serve, because this was a not what I remembered from the past.  2 stars"}
{"text":"When my mom was high school she worked at Riazzi's in their old location. (Torn down looooooong ago.) The same people who owned it then, own it now. Growing up Riazzi's was always a constant part of my restaurant experience. (The owners remember my mom and she still talks to them when we go.) They have great food, made from old family recipes. I have always enjoyed the chicken piccata and chicken marsala. I like the red wine, the bread and desserts. Riazzi's is a true Italian family restaurant that has been a part this community for many years, and for a good reason: They are great at what they do.  It's local, it's real, it's my kind of place."}
{"text":"Well, think '70s italian - heavy on the italian dressing and meat sauce and you have Riazzi's. It appears more institution rather than foodie mecca. A lot of regulars that are more about getting together with one another than eating great italian food. My guess, Riazzi's menu and recipes have not changed since the '80s. If you want to check out the denizens of Tempe, hit it up but a decent pasta and Chianti, not so much."}
{"text":"Gave them another chance and am glad I did. The chicken picatta was amazing and Christopher the bartender won me over with his service. I guess everyone has a bad night... I just wish they would give the patio a server and a hose down. Its lovely to sit outside during the cooler AZ months. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I gave Riazzi's a second chance this evening after a lengthy boycott. I was seeing a play at Gammage and the location made it a convenient choice for pre-theater dinner. My first experience with Riazzi's came as a team lunch about 3 years ago. The food was good, but when the waiter brought each person their check, he brought one of my co-workers two receipts. The co-worker looked them over and told the waiter he charged his card twice. The waiter said let me take care of that, tore one receipt in half and walked away, not fixing the problem. As the group left the restaurant he chased us down in the parking lot and said we didn't leave enough of a tip. I have not been back until tonight.  The restaurant is noticeable thanks to the large tree in the front yard. That tree as well as many others were decorated with lights for the holiday. Inside the restaurant was very festive and had a nice feel. Using my handy Yelp mobile application, I read some of the reviews and decided to order the Toretellini Riazzi with pesto cream sauce. My friend went with the stuffed eggplant.    The salad arrived first and it was an interesting blend. The first thing I noticed was the presence of beets. I have never had a beet, but it was there so I figured I might as well try it. It wasn't as bad as I expected - firmer and tasted like pickled dirt, but it was okay. The house dressing and the pepper made a good combination.   The entrees came out and my friend looked over her plate. The appearance of the dish was mostly that of the sauce and cheese. She offered a bite and I had to play Jacque Cousteau to actually find the eggplant. While she said it was good, she was not impressed with the swamp of sauce covering the dish and though flavorful, she admitted she would not order it again. The side fettuccini was good.  As for the tortellini, what can I say? Fabulous! It was very flavorful, huge portions and one of the best things I have had in some time. Unfortunately I was headed to the theater and didn't want the car to smell like pesto all night, so half of it had to go. No time for dessert.  The waiter was very pleasant, provided ample time to review the menu, answered questions and kept the drinks filled. Service was excellent this time, my dish was incredible and the menu large enough that I am sure my friend could find something more to her liking next time.  And the price - very nice. We both had water, but with both entrees, the included salad and her included side of fettuccini, it was just under $30.  Pretty good for a evening with a nice Italian dinner. I think my first experience with this place was a fluke and based on tonight, I would definitely give it another shot. My next play tickets are in 3 weeks, so I might be back then!"}
{"text":"First time here. Family owned for over 40 years. The cheese ravioli was awesome. Perfectly cooked and thick. Meatballs were great. The lasagna was delicious. The chicken parmesan was great. The outside was crunchy, not soggy. I would come back if we lived here!! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is your old school Italian restaurant.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Tony Soprano there.  The food has always been excellent and appears to be all done in-house.  The waiter even commented that the sausage was made in-house so the spices could vary depending on the chef.  I usually get the mussels which are served swimming in a big wide bowl with butter to dip.  And they are not too shabby considering we are in the middle of the desert.  How I miss good seafood.  My next favorite is the eggplant parm.  Very yummy.  This is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to this Riazzi's four times in the past decade and I decided to weigh in after our recent dinner there:  it's an overrated Italian place as regards flavors.  There is no feeling that the chef has a real presence in the food-----it's just underwhelming, adequate pasta.  You know, good Italian food will knock your socks off, and this is not the place where that will happen."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been coming here for over 15 years, and each time for the last 5 the service has been slowly going down hill. Well tonight we waited and waited to be seated. Waited well over 10 min for our server to take our order. Over all the food was hot and good but the service still needs work"}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 overall they do a really good job at getting you more water, food & checking on you. No complaints  Food: 4/5 not the best ever but for a local Tempe place it's good and you get a lot of food, worth the price (around $12) for the entire meal in my opinion.   Experience: 4/5 some people say that this place is in need of remodeling and it's outdated but to be honest I think that is what gives it it's charm. This place has been around for ages and the feel inside the restaurant is reflective of that.   Pictures attached"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like stepping back in time in the best way. My boyfriend and I ate there last night and it was delicious. They make their own salad dressings. The antipasti salad was huge and yummy. I had the half and half ravioli and it was so good. Took the leftovers for lunch today and it was STILL good. Fresh hot bread at the table too. Our waitress was awesome and the hostess was a sweetheart. We will definitely be back. It's so nice to find a place with some character in Tempe that doesn't break the bank. Can't wait to try the desserts- we were just so stuffed by the end of our meal, we couldn't handle it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but something is obviously different now. Frozen seafood, small portions, so-so service and staff not knowing the menu. In a town starving for a good Italian restaurant, this one is just not worth it."}
{"text":"If you've read my reviews, you know that I think that The Olive Garden chain is singlehandedly dumbing down America's taste for Italian cuisine. Riazzi's deserves your support for keeping this corner of Tempe a place where the three fs of Italian flourish: flavor, family and um, OK two fs.  When the place was last decorated in 1971, it was perfect. So why change? Yeah, it's dark and oddly laid out but so was my first girlfriend. If Riazzi's isn't what you're looking for in an independently run family Italian place, get your ass to Little Cesear's and eat cheezy breadsticks until they start tasting good."}
{"text":"I went to college in walking distance from Little Italy in Cleveland, OH and was sad to find that AZ had so few Italian restaurants! I was thrilled to find Riazzi's. All I ever get here is pasta, meatballs, and red sauce and they are delicious - just what I got used to in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Since it was Friday night, we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. I had \"cavatelli (gnocchi)\", as they put on the menu. It was the worst gnocchi I had ever had - very thin and long, it lacked potatoey taste of real gnocchi. There should be disclaimer explaining what cavatelli is, without any link to gnocchi. The amount of sauce was very frugal, so when I was halfway through with my cavatelli, it was all gone. Also, to improve the taste of the sauce, I had to add some butter and parmesan crumbs.  Grated parmesan was served in little ramekin which was fresh. Butter came in little plastic single-serve containers you may find in diners but not in fine Italian dining. Also, crackers were single-serve, too; last time I had those when I ordered to go from a deli. Bread was just plain white baguette, no rosemary nor olive oil."}
{"text":"Decent food. Sometimes really good, sometimes not but usually ok. Service is always on the short and slow side. If you're looking for a safe bet Italian place this does the job. Just go a day with some extra time to kill."}
{"text":"My husband has a beef with this restaurant. I suggested we go, but he reminded me that the last time 2 times we were there the food was not very good, a warm iceberg lettuce salad, cool pizza. And he swears the server took some of our left over pizza instead of boxing it."}
{"text":"Two words describe this place, Old School.  The restaurant and bar area are certainly dated, kind of like a throwback to the 60's or 70's and could certainly use a makeover and the food is Old school Italian as well which is actually just fine with me as there is nothing better to me than an heaping portion of spaghetti and meatballs to bring back old family memories. Service was friendly and food came out fairly fast."}
{"text":"In Tempe for a triathlon, and needing to carb-load with some pasta, I found this place on Yelp.  It was about two miles from my hotel, and the reviews here were good enough for me to check it out.  It's a perfectly fine, mid-range, family-oriented Italian restaurant.  When I dine alone, I take a book, so I always request a quiet corner booth.  The hostess gave me the best that they had, as it was a crowded, busy Saturday night.  There was a chatty family at the adjacent table, but they left halfway into my dinner.  I had a Veal Piccatta, fettucini alfredo, a Moretti beer, and a glass of the house Chianti.  Hot Italian bread came out immediately, and it was excellent.  The salad was uninspired - just iceberg lettuce with a few garnishes.  The blue cheese dressing was great, though, being thick and chunky.  The pasta and veal were perfectly cooked, and I was given a bowl of parmesan cheese, which went great with the pasta.  The tab?  $30 (before tip) for bread, salad, entree, a beer, and a glass of wine.  The food was excellent and the ambiance is very nice.  Reading the other reviews that complain about Riazzi's having dated decor - I don't agree.  The floral patterns in the booth are appropriate.  The only thing that I thought could stand an improvement was the chairs - they're quite worn, and I remember seeing the same chairs in a pizzaria in the 70's.  But it's not a big deal.  This is a very nice, reasonably-priced Italian place with excellent food and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Riazzi's is the type of place that you need to know what you are doing and what to expect to enjoy it.  Other reviewers are right on about some of the negatives:  the decor is horrible and certain menu items are fine but not impressive.  Here is what you need to know to dig it:  1.  Sit in the bar-- it has a cooler vibe than the dining room (kind of mobstery) 2.  Order seafood or one of the specialty dinners.  Don't fill up on bread or salad, the bread is great, and the salad is the old school iceberge lettuce with beets and pepperochinis. 3.  If you want pizza, they make great pizza, but keep it simple, this is not the type of pizza you want to ruin with a ton of toppings.  We usually order it with just onions or just garlic. I wouldn't add pepperoni, it just isn't that type of pizza.  If you don't like onions, you don't know anything about food, and should eat every meal at Applebee's. 4.  I also recommend the chicken Marsala, but I have never had it anywhere else, so it is hard to say if it is a good one.  I like it, and I am a fan of food. 5.  The prices are reasonable to cheap for a sit down place.  Can't go wrong with that!  It's a good place!  Don't let the other review fool you, just be prepared, and don't expect Olive Garden.  This is real food.  I think some people have forgotten what real food is."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in town. While eating dessert, I died and went to canoli heaven ."}
{"text":"When I planned our visit to Phoenix and decided to eat Italian food one night while we were there, I envisioned one of those old style southern Italian neighborhood eateries that I remembered, and so often enjoyed, growing up in New York city (many years ago). Turning to Yelp reviewers and after reading Riazzi's accolades, I was sure I'd found a real winner. When I saw that Riazzi's promoted the fact that they've been around since 1947, I was doubly confident that I'd found exactly what I was looking for. Not so. Maybe it was that 50 years ago, but no longer.   Cocktails were the best part of the meal.   From that point, everything went down hill. Bread was soft and spongy, not the crusty chewy loaf I expected. Butter was soft and in a tiny prepackaged tub. The quality of the antipasto ingredients although plentiful, tasted like they came directly from a super market salad bar; breaded and fried calamari was overly bready and strangely mushy; two of the salads were over dressed, and one barely moistened, with a watery overly vinegary house Italian dressing.   For our main courses we chose; chicken parmigiana which was deemed \"not as good as Olive Garden\"; Shrimp parmigiana (4 medium sized shrimp smothered in tomato sauce and mozzarella for $17.95); baked sea scallops which were overly breaded and tasted of some indistinguishable and unpleasant spice or herb; and traditional lasagna. Our collective conclusion was that the least offensive choice was the latter, although it was skimpy with meat and unnecessarily abundant with cheese.   All entrees included the aforementioned salads and (except for the lasagna) a side of overcooked pasta. Red sauce on the pasta was edible, but the Alfredo congealed into one sticky like warm mass.   Don't bother with this place unless you have a time machine and set it back half a century."}
{"text":"I do love this place for one reason or another, maybe the food I order every time I stop in maybe the slightly dated dÃ©cor, I love old school and vintage and the have been here like forever which I think is awesome.  A must is the Scarpel soup, no one else close by has it that I know of, it is awesome! Home made ravioli, just 2 things I enjoy and you don't find home made every where.  I like to bring my out of town guest here, reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants from home in PA."}
{"text":"I'd give a half or zero stars if I could. Too pricey and poor svc. Ordered for 3 people pick up... got home and missing an item. When called spent 15 min trying to explain to the woman only to be told the soup that was ordered as part of a meal was complimentary,  didn't need to be given basically. Won't go back. Food was ok, nothing special. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 26 years. The service is always great and the food can't be beat. This is old school Italian!"}
{"text":"Bartender is beyond rude!!!!!!! Very racist! My friends and I were the only brown people at the bar and he would not take our orders for dinner. Everyone else at the bar was white and they all had their food.  He wasn't that busy.  I saw him go back and forth a few times with empty hands. I didn't see him make any mixed drinks. Serving wine isn't rocket science or that hard.    Even the host was a bad employee. If there is a wait, offer the bar, apologize for the wait, but never tell people \"you can go somewhere else\".  You can tell this place is established. Because only a place that established can stay in businesses even with these type of employees.  Will never go back or will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hidden treasures in Tempe.  If you have been in the Tempe area you probably have driven past this family establishment, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you enter it's like being in someone's home.    The ambiance here is very intimate and comforting, as if you're in the family's personal dining room enjoying their recipes passed down from generation to generation.  The service is exceptional, always bringing you more bread, filling your glass before it empties, and asking if you need anything.    The food is tradtional italian fare, they offer you bread as soon as you sit down and nearly everything meal comes with your choice of garden salad or soup, unlike a lot of restaurants today where it's an additional cost.  They have a wide vareity to choose from and everything I've had there has been great.    I highly reccomend Riazzi's during the holiday's, the decorate the interior beautifully and really put you in the spirit of things.  Would reccommend for a Christmas eve dinner out or what not.    My favorite dishes:  the calamari appetizer, the calamari linguini, and the sausage and bell peppers!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I have discriminating tastes when it comes to Italian food and despite the less than favorable reviews listed here, I decided to try it. It was relatively quiet and intimate and has a unique style about itself (hence \"Garden\" in the name).  I found the pasta to be cooked very well. However, the meat sauce was a bit runny. If they had less water in it, it would be perfect. The time it took for the food to be served was good - not rushed and not unnecessarily delayed.   The waiter service was great. Again, not being super-busy, this is expected. They delivered and I was very happy with it.   The critique about interior dÃ©cor is a hyperboles at best. Simply, the floral patterns on the booths are a bit dated, but this has no bearing on the dining experience. By the description of the reviews from others, I was expecting to walk into sea-green and puke-yellow color. It was nothing of the sort and I found the interior calming and quiet - the way an Italian restaurant should be.   While I'm still exploring about additional sit-down Italian restaurants across Tempe, I will keep this on my short list of places to hit.   Oh yeah, friends don't let friends go to Olive Garden or Sbarros. Shop local! ;-)"}
{"text":"So I've lived within 2 miles of this place for over 20 years and I have to admit that this is my first time in this fine establishment, and am very disappointed in myself that it has taken 20 years. Our server, Eric quickly became one of my favorite servers ever. He was extremely knowledgeable, especially for only been working here for 6 months, respectful almost to a fault and incredibly attentive. Our food was above expectations and more than worth the price. I have found my new favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the authenticity of this place. I have been coming here for years and they are very open to supporting community events. It is family owned and operated.  The service can be slow however the ambiance is relaxed and we enjoy our wine and conversation as if we are in Italy, not impatient America."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a dozen times over the last 20 years and love it.  Family place, I've never seen an advertisement in the paper or on them Internets.  I think Family Owned says it all.  Somebody's family has a restaurant, cares about customers and service and good Italian food.  The only thing that I ever had that was bad there was the house red wine, which was absolute crap, but I order it all the time.  House reds are always crap at family Italian joints!    Go here next time you consider going out for Italian."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight with some friends and it was a solid meal. It was nothing super special, but it wasn't bad. The decor, as stated before, is super old school, but I don't really mind. The bread they bring out is warm and tasty and the service was wonderful! They filled our waters consistently and brought out more and more bread... which was great! I ordered the cheese ravioli with meatballs and it came with minestrone soup. The soup wasn't bad, but wasn't great. It tasted kind of like canned tomato soup with veggies thrown in. The raviolis are home made, which they looked, but were kind of odd. The plate had three large raviolis on it. They had really thick dough and were large and stuffed with too much cheese. These didn't taste bad, but they were too rich... just too much pasta and too much cheese... I wish they made smaller raviolis with thinner pasta and less cheese. In addition, the meatballs were extremely firm... the flavor wasn't bad, but the texture was off. They were just a little spicy, which was nice. Overall, the place was ok.... not mind blowing or somewhere I would run back to, but it was alright, and if I got invited back, I wouldn't say no."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Marsala. It was extremely bland and over-priced. I will never get food from here again."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! If your taste buds are craving an Italian meal, you are going to be happy you came. You can't tell a book by the cover and the same saying applies to this restaurant but all the quality is definitely in the recipes. I would also give a shoutout to our server, Eli. Very great server with a great personality. We will definitely come back when we are in town for Spring Training next year."}
{"text":"I visited Riazzi's for the first time with a small group.  The staff were very agreeable, separate  checks were not an issue.  I was extremely pleased that their \"lite\" menu wasn't chicken fingers, nuggets or grilled cheese with french fries!  It's REAL food from the menu, just down sized (I still took leftovers home!).  I got red sauce and it had annise, not a favorite of mine, but I understand it can be common in Italian foods.  Next time, I'll try a different sauce. I was so happy when the salad was iceberg and romaine!  I'm really opposed to the weeds I find in so many places. Everything was cooked to perfection and fresh made pasta, too!  Everyone got a different dish, no one had a negative thing to say, and the boys from Italy at our table cleaned their plates!  Our server, Nick, was very accommodating and friendly, but not bothersome and made us feel at ease and important.  They have a wonderful entry patio that doesn't look to be used as part of the restaurant.  This night would have been a perfect night for an outside dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was much better than we expected. After seeing mixed reviews here on yelp, we decided to try it anyway because it was closest by and they said they were not busy at the time. Other places had more than an hour to get seated. Food was fantastic, authentic Italian. Service was spot on! We will be back when we come back to town!"}
{"text":"You have to be kidding?   Sure, this place was a landmark in its day and WAS a great inexpensive treat but they have no doubt adopted a don't care attitude.  Antipasta plater with peppers, mushrooms in a sauce and bologna?  Please.  It went downhill from there.  The service is worse and the place is tired looking.   Head North to Lo Cascio's Italian Restaurant on Scottsdale Road, North Tempe.  Kitschy, sure, and you will love the owner with her over-the-top glasses yet when the food comes, now that's Italian."}
{"text":"Dined at Riazzi's for the first time last night and was very impressed. It has a cozy family italian feel with all the classic dishes on the menu. The staff was very attentive and the chicken parm with fettucine was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a small quiet little restaurant nestled on a street corner in Tempe. When you walk in here, you feel as though you're in a scene from a Godfather movie. From the door greeter to the bartender, they all make you feel so welcome. This spot has the best sweet red wine (for those of legal drinking age).....ask for it just like that. \"Can I please have a glass of your sweetest red wine?\" Its very delicious! The food was good also, well portioned. I order the chicken parmesan & it was yummy. No complaints. I went during dinner time so the atmosphere was quiet & it was very dim lit.  I recommend this place if you're trying to be romantic or just want alone time with someone special."}
