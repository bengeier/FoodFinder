{"text":"Came here yesterday while I was on vacation and it really satisfied my sushi craving. The place was clean, the employee was helpful and the food came out super fast. The all you can eat deal came out to be 23 Canadian dollars and I tipped them another 5 because I wasn't able to finish all my food. I even had to tell them not to make my last roll because it was so much! I really enjoyed it here and wish I had an all you can eat sushi place like this back in the States where I live :( definitely recommend"}
{"text":"a fan of their take-out sushi roll special.
Good value... satisfies sushi craving at lowest price"}
{"text":"My friends and I were planning a sushi lunch weeks ago. I found this place on google and the reviews didn't disappoint me. When we walked in, it was pretty busy. I always think that is a good sign of a good restaurant. It was 19.99 per person but they served sashimi at 1pm. Most sushi places do not serve sashimi till dinner. The ladies were nice and even one lady told us that their tuna is the freshest because of its color. 

All in all, I would go back here again to eat sushi"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi: fresh and very generous portions. I highly recommend spicy salmon roll and any sushimi! I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! I do not recommend this place to ANYONE. Water is very smelly. Such an unsanitary place .. Money wasted .. Sushi was so plain and all the same .. Bad presentation .. But nice server if that counts justifying the one star given"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I've tried both their lunch specials (yummy rolls- rice very well flavoured, and very good value) as well as buffet (fresh sashimi, yummy cooked foods eg. takoyaki aka octopus balls) and they both exceeded my expectations. Staff are friendly. Decor is so so but I've seen worse and it doesn't bother me much. The best thing about the buffet is that you can specify quantity and they can give you little servings of each so that you can sample a big variety of dishes. Don't let the shabby exterior scare you away, now I realize I should have tried it earlier!"}
{"text":"Their lunch deal is really affordable for decent sushi.. the sushi isn't amazing but for 6.50 for 2 sets of rolls... it's pretty good quality for the price you pay..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food
Excellent service
Very small AYCE selection but good enough
Regular menu has amazing selection
Price is moderate
Food is blazingly fast to the table
And there spicy salmon was actually spicy enough that I had to stop for a drink"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary just this past weekend with a staycation at the Hilton in Toronto (we live in the GTA) and decided to search the web for a good sushi place near the area. This was about 20 minutes walk from the hotel. On a Saturday night, the place was empty, but as soon as 8 pm hit, people started trickling in. The food was delicious (we've been to many other AYCE sushi places before), service was just as great, and the $19.99 AYCE price was worth it. We've paid more for less service and OK food. We liked this place so much that two nights later, Monday night, after an event downtown, we decided to have dinner here once again. We made it by 9:45 pm, thought they closed at 10:30 pm, when in fact they close at 10 pm! The staff were so nice that they still allowed us to order from the AYCE menu 15 minutes before closing. Talk about good service. We were the last customers and felt like we closed down the restaurant for us to eat haha! Anyway, the food was just as delicious and the service superb. Will definitely come back when we're back in the area and will recommend the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I definitely wouldn't recommend Gallery Sushi to anyone looking for good AYCE. The service was very slow and the waitress was inattentive. We receive the first half of our order, then waited 30 minutes for the second half. In order to get the bill, I eventually had to walk up to the counter and ask. The food was definitely so-so. The rolls were good for the most part, although nothing special. The left the veins in the shrimp tempura which reaaaally put me off. Sashimi and salmon sushi were decent. Overall, I absolutely would not go back. The lunch price was a ridiculous $22.99 before tax. I'm surprised this place has such a decent rating...."}
{"text":"i had all you can eat for $18.99.
the waitress is very friendly.

1st order:
green dragon, red dragon, black dragon, philadelphia (these are 5 pc big rolls)
and i tried a piece of calamari (deep fry squid), takoyaki (Japanese Octopus Dumpling Balls), ebiyaki (shrimp)

after finish them i am so full but i still want a second because it taste so good and i never saw these 2 item at other ayce i've been to 

2nd order: 
2 calamari (it taste so good everyone should try it)
4 takoyaki (i saw so many japanese cartoon showing this food)"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, but the sushi was great and the service was prompt/friendly. Probably the best spicy salmon hand roll I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"The takeout special is great. 2 rolls for 6.25! 

It's not the best if you're in a rush, because they make everything fresh to order. So it's amazing if you're having a leisurely study day or some time between classes. It's also open until 10, while the rest of the restaurants in the Grange food court seem to be closed by 7. A great alternative to Pizzaolo next door. 

I definitely recommend their asparagus roll. What an interesting idea! There's also squash- I haven't tried that one yet."}
{"text":"I had wanted to do AYCE sushi since I came to Toronto in 2015, but always heard/read most places would likely disappoint. This weekend, after searching for reviews, I went there with a friend (who loves good food and has tried a LOT of AYCE sushi places) and we were both completely satisfied with what Gallery Sushi offered - hence the 5 stars rating. 

It isn't cheap - 20.99 for AYCE regardless of it being lunch or dinner - but I tend to value quality over price. AYCE included a vast selection of offerings, from appetizer, hot dishes, to standard and special rolls and nigiri fish varieties, as well as dessert. Our orders came quickly and the quality was superior to the majority of a-la-carte sushi places I have been to here in Toronto! Fresh fish, great tempura, tasty takoyaki. We ate a huge amount (seriously!) and they had no problem in sending more. 

The ambiance is very simple (so probably not a place to impress), the place is quite clean, but the dated exterior appearance does not reflect how good this place is. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is hidden, not too easy to find, but the service and food are really good!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food from a little known place. Low/mid price point.

First the hot food items are cooked well (rare in this area). Fried items are crispy and not oily.  They do tempura well and has one of the better takoyaki. The sauces that accompany items are not watered down; they do a proper teriyaki with the right hint of ginger.

Sushi is good for ayce. Everyone has a different preference for their rice and here, there's a slight sweetness that's noticeable. Rice to fish balance is just right. Very good spicy salmon roll and tuna nigiri that actually has flavour. The sashimi  was sliced satisfactory although the white tuna may have been a bit off. Temperature is OK mostly because they're not very busy. Would prefer the rice to be slightly warmer.

Will go again."}
{"text":"Good sushi and sashimi, probably one of the best I've had in Canada(the other really good one is in banff), and considering the $, it is the best indeed. Tempura is nice as well. Environment is good, very Japanese style. 
The only reason I didn't give 5 star is for they only serve food and do not smile. It is a problem I have with many asian restaurants.

Overall if I have choice I would definitely go there again in future."}
{"text":"My personal AYCE sushi place in the city. I love their rolls, and the fish is very fresh. The owner is also the loveliest lady. Good for takeout too!

I personally recommend the spicy salmon sushi"}
{"text":"Very good and inexpensive AYCE sushi restaurant. The food delicious and fresh, I loved it. Price is $20 per person, which is very good for a dinner AYCE as well. Wasn't busy on a Monday night and good if you want good sushi that isn't too expensive and is quiet for good conversations with friends. Employees are nice but they had new kitchen staff so the service was a little slow, which wasn't the worst thing since it's all you can eat and we could take our time talking rather than stuffing food down throat that we become full quickly.

Employees are mostly Korean but good authentic Japanese interior + food(kinda surprising). Don't sit near the front door, kinda chilly(whole place could be a little warmer, too)."}
{"text":"One of the more reliable AYCE sushi in the downtown area. The fish is fresh, dependable rice ratio, service is quick and the people who work there are super nice. The only downside is their roll offering is pretty basic, but for me, that works out for me as I only really eat spicy salmon, dynamite and sashimi. You should definitely give it a try. It's a cheaper alternative, especially on the weekends and there really isn't any downside to it. 

If you go, get the spicy salmon! So good."}
{"text":"I went for lunch here on a Thursday. I ordered the black dragon ($10.95) and veg tampers ($4.50) with a Budweiser ($3.50). Very fast service, pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is a hidden gem! We were looking for an all you can eat sushi restaurant and came across this one! We were hesitant at first but decided to go in anyway because we were so hungry. The quality of the food is 8.5/10. You have the option of ordering the special rolls in smaller or bigger sizes which is great. Their customer service was amazing. Their red bean was very good! I was really impressed with this AYCE sushi and would definitely go back if I'm in the area. Their AYCE dinner price is cheap! Majority of the AYCE charge between 23-25.99. We paid $19.99 pp. Overall, I would rate this restaurant a 9/10. The interior could use some renovations but the place was clean."}
{"text":"Have gotten the take out special a number of times here which is great value. It's prepared freshly while you wait and they use great produce. Staff helpful with menu if needed. 
Really not sure why it's never busy, but they are tucked away from the main food court."}
{"text":"The sad sandwich board outside on the street and inside the Grange make it seem like a sketchy place to dine.  I have only had the take-out special here which gets you two types of rolls (6 pieces or a handroll) for $5.50, taxes included.  They never seem to be very busy which is a bad sign for a sushi place, but so far all of my sushi from Gallery has been fresh and I've never gotten sick from it.  The bonus to them not being very busy is that your food is prepared very quickly.  They offer seating while you wait for your order to be prepared and will happily give you wasabi, soy and chopsticks with your food.

While it's definitely not the best sushi in Toronto, it's not bad for the price and convenience.


Great prices.  Quick to prepare.  A little sketchy."}
{"text":"I've visited Gallery Sushi about twice and it's probably my favourite AYCE restaurant in terms of just sushi. Compared to other places, their rolls have a fantastic rice to filling ratio! Which is great considering the price you pay for AYCE. Although I'm not a big fan of sashimi, you can tell they serve fresh and high quality fish as there isn't that weird ~fishy~ taste.

Although their AYCE menu is not as extensive, who really cares about the small sides when you're really there for the sushi?

I highly recommend their spicy salmon and tuna rolls, super delicious and probably one of the best I've had. 

Service is great as well! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"the price is alright for dinner, but it's just another mediocre AYCE sushi like any other. uh also their AC seems broken :/"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 4 stars. Sure, at $21 it's cheaper than most all you can eat, but it's not the greatest and the selection is minimal. It's basically $21 for ayce classic rolls and sushi, your salmons tunas and dragon rolls. The location is off the beaten path and the atmosphere is a bit gloomy. The service is sort of slow and inattentive, even when your 1 of only like 3 tables there. The sushi is okay, I've obviously had better, but I've also had worse. The fish isn't the freshest. The rice is a bit sticky and globby. And the tempura is cold and mealy. The hand rolls are good, so I basically just stuck to those. The fried banana and ice cream are decent though! Overall, glad I tried, but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Great AYCE place! Only about $19 for lunch. Rice layer is thin and soft. They are generous with stuffings and toppings, and rolled up into huge pieces. 

If you're thinking about sushi and somewhere cheap and delicious, this is definitely a good place."}
{"text":"Good food, poor ambiance

I'd only re-visit this restaurant if I am in the area and am extremely hangry. The restaurant is owned by a super sweet Korean lady who had her two children hanging out in the restaurant (they are so cute). 

The food was great - Sashimi is fresh, sliced thick but definitely not insta-worthy. I always order eel since it's my favourite and it is so good - better than a lot of places. Miso soup was too salty for my liking, and the chicken teriyaki sauce was too light and runny. 

This would have been a great spot if it wasn't for the ambiance. The AC was not working, and the music was so quiet I could barely hear it. Definitely not a date night spot. 

There is WiFi! So if you're looking for a low-maintenance night and just want to fill your stomach with good food, it's not a bad place. All depends what type of night you're looking for."}
{"text":"Gallery Sushi is basically an extension of my company's cafeteria. The running joke is that we should probably assume ownership given a large number of work lunches are booked here. 
It's basic cheap sushi, friendly service. Small  and quaint. I wouldn't cross the city for it and you probably already come here if you work in the area.
Come on by if you want to watch me negotiate with a bunch of cheap executives that didn't spring for Japango."}
{"text":"The sushi was great! Muuuuuch bigger than what I am used to in the US, so one roll was enough for the meal. Also, each roll comes with miso soup!  I had the crunchy roll and the tempura roll. The place itself is a little small though."}
{"text":"Came for the all you can eat sushi. Did not disappoint. Very good rolls, can choose between the big ones or the small ones."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times over the past few years - it's inside the Grange.
I'll be honest, the food is middle of the road and the decor is outdated.  However, their lunch specials are offered all day at the same price!

So I ordered a bento chicken terriyaki box for dinner @ 6.95.
The waitress bought some lukewarm green tea, with a pretty good miso soup.
About 10 minutes later, my bento box arrived with chicken (white meat), bean sprouts underneath, rice, glass noodles (japchae), two pieces of deep fried tofu - which was quite good, and a salad.

I felt pretty full afterwards - and was able to eat for less than $10.00 including tax and tip.  I wouldn't specifically make a trip here, but if you're in the mood for a meal less than a food court meal with table service, then I'd come here!

I think it is Korean owned, and they also have an 18.99 all you can eat special - same price weekdays and weekends."}
{"text":"I find this to be a tough review because I loved my meal but it made me sick...

I had dinner before a Leafs game and had the ayce menu.  The menu was smaller than most places but the food was really good!

The sushi rice was soft but not mushy and the fish was fresh and well-proportioned.  I really liked how the salmon rolls were California-style (rice on the outside, rolled in toasted sesame seeds).

The udon and donburi dishes were good and in small portions.  I really like this because you don't want a huge bowl when ordering ayce.

Tempura was average but good.  I really liked the tempura sauce they use though!  Just like my dad makes; tastier and sweeter than most restaurants.

Having said all of this, something I ate didn't sit well with me.  I spent the last bit of dinner (15-20 min) in the bathroom and I left with bad stomach pains.  I hadn't eaten anything else all day, so it must have been the food.

Other than some fluky bad food, I did enjoy dinner and it was one of the better ayce Japanese dinners I've had.  Is that weird?  I haven't decided if I'll go back but I'm tempted."}
{"text":"I'm not too anal about  AYCE in terms of review but this is probably the best one I've visited in awhile in terms of pricing and selection. Place is quite small and space is close to other tables. It's true that the selection is limited, however, their overall menu items are enough to fill me up including sashimi. It's $20 for AYCE Dinner [that's the only thing they have, otherwise, it is a la carte during lunch].

Will be back again! I just need friends who love sushi as much as I do from Ryerson -_-' Wanna be friends?"}
{"text":"How this place has 4 stars on Yelp is beyond me. This place serves both regular and AYCE menu. We chose AYCE. First of all, service was non-existent. The one (only one) waitress was running around trying to serve the whole restaurant plus non-stop takeout orders. We had to help ourselves to napkins & chopsticks. The wait for food was over an hour after we ordered, because apparently the takeout orders had to be served first. 

Now the food, I'm not too picky when it comes to AYCE but this is really disappointing. Everything is made to \"cut-cost\". Miso soup has no tofu/seaweed, flying fish roe sushi is a chunk of rice with some fish roe sprinkled on top.. The spider row tasted like nothing.. Even the ice cream tasted like it's been stale for months (how do you screw that one up??) 

Will not return again."}
{"text":"Great value for AYCE - $20! Came here for dinner on a Weds, and it wasn't that busy. 

The AYCE is worth it just for the sashimi and the rolls. I loved the white sashimi (I can't remember the name of it, but it's the one that's solid white in colour). Salmon sashimi was also good and thickly cut. We ordered a variety of rolls and they were all very well done. Lots of selection, and great filling-to-rice ratio. My fav was the spicy tuna. Just get any of the spicy ones, really. The spicy flavour they add is unique and delicious. The takoyaki balls were good too.

The fried stuff (ie tempura, calamari) were pretty average. The seaweed salad tasted a bit off to me. Didn't really like the seasoning in the beef teriyaki. 

Overall, though, could be a really amazing AYCE sushi experience if you just order the good stuff. I would definitely return for AYCE here!"}
{"text":"This place served dual purpose for me: good value and taste lunch specials when I used to work downtown, and awesome AYCE sushi dinners. 

Lunch specials are incredibly common for sushi places. Gallery's lunch specials won't blow your mind, but it'll fill your cravings. They also have one of the best specials in my opinion. Their $5.50 for 2 rolls special is a great deal. I also had a bento box for take out and it wasn't bad at all. 

Their dinner AYCE deserves praise. Gallery has some of the best sushi in the GTA, especially considering that it's an AYCE place. I feel that many people are turned away by their small menu selection for AYCE. This can easily be overlooked by me because what they do well (sushi), they do really well. Their sushi has the best rice to fish ratio I've ever seen. Actually their sushi's are smaller than other places but this is a plus for me because I can always order more. While it's smaller, the piece of fish is not small at all. Perhaps the best part is that they have yellowtail sushi in their AYCE. As far as I can tell, this is the ONLY AYCE place that offers yellow tail fish NOT in a roll. Because they have squid, fish eggs, and yellow tail sushi, this is one of the few sushi places where I like to order lots of sushi and not just sashimi. 

In terms of selection, while it is small, it has all my favourite items. They have the standard salmon/white tuna/red snapper etc,  + yellow tail fish + octopus sushi. They have a long list of rolls. Their kitchen item list is incredibly short but I don't mind because this means I get to stuff myself with their delicious sushi. They have takoyaki which is not common for AYCE sushi. 

The AYCE dinner price is reasonable too. A small, focused menu allows them to offer reasonably fresh raw fish and keep it under $20. If I recall, it's $18.99 for AYCE dinner. I'd come here more often if I didn't live so far."}
{"text":"If you order a la carte, the food is really good but if you order buffet the quality of the food decreases because they earn less :("}
{"text":"Great hidden little all you can eat sushi place off of the busy Dundas square area. 

It's a smaller food menu than other places but the food is fresh and delicious. 

Definitely come here if you plan on crushing delicious sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing! Very fresh, not too much rice, and everything was the right temperature. It had a family vibe and I felt very comfortable. I had the AYCE dinner special which had a great selection from every part of the menu.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gallery sushi is in a good location near UofT campus or Chinatown walking distance. You don't have to go all the way to Bloor or Bay for ayce with this little gem on Dundas.The dinner all you can eat is great value. The staff is really nice and attentive. They make all the hand rolls and sushi right past the counter. They also do party platters if you're ordering for a large group."}
{"text":"This is my all time favourite sushi/take out place. The wait staff is so kind and attentive, and the prices are amazing ($7 for the two roll take out special, ~$20 for ayce). The lady that owns the place is often there when I go and she is super nice. I have an avocado allergy and she always makes sure to omit avocado from anything I order. Other sushi restaurants don't do that, which makes me appreciate the service here so much since I can order anything on the menu! :)

Only thing that could be improved on is adding spicy salmon to the take out special menu :)"}
{"text":"The taste was \"just so so\". Not impressive and actually a little under expectations. The sashimi tasted fine but should be better. Not much choices for all you can eat on the menu. So far the worst \"all you can eat\" sushi I had in dt Toronto."}
{"text":"Never going here again. Inside this restaurant looks sketchy and dirty, especially the floor it's so sticky .  Sushi were terrible, the Salmon in the salmon hand cone is warm, where as usually is cold and looks fresh. Basically \"this place sucks\""}
{"text":"Took my mom here for lunch foe her specialist appointment. Due to my disappointment, they were not serving all you can eat (which was only for weekend dinner only)
My mom did enjoyed her bento box - Chicken teriyaki. Mine was a Unagi Don which was mediocre.
It was overall okay experience."}
{"text":"Gallery Sushi is a small sushi shop owned by a Korean family, I think? The menu is by far not extensive but the essentials are there: sashimi at the diner menu, a good selection of sushis, a good selection of rolls and a choose of warm dishes. 

Their shinning point for me is their sushis: warm soft rice with a large slab of fish covering the rice as well as falling on the sides. The salmon and tuna sushis are my favourites. 

For 20.99 on a weekend night, I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quiet low key dinner (the place is very low key, minimal decorations and ambiance)."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of gallery sushi. The price is not bad for dinner $21.99 but I would rather have paid a few more dollars for some nicer sushi. The wait staff are very friendly, and relatively attentive for an AYCE sushi place. My biggest complaint was with the fish itself, it just didn't taste the most fresh and was a little slimy. The rice to fish ratio in most items wasn't bad. I was also not a fan of the hot food items like the teriyaki. Overall, can't say that I would recommend Gallery sushi and will keep searching for a go to AYCE sushi place downtown."}
{"text":"Lots of good items on the all you can eat menu.  Service was quick and efficient. Never had to really wait for food as it was perfectly timed.  Very good bang for your buck. They accommodated our group of 9 on short notice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for the AYCE sushi, which was 21.99$(before tax)

All the fish was really fresh. The unagi, spicy salmon, mackerel and spicy tuna sushi were my favourite things to order on the menu. The all you can eat menu has a wide variety, including sashimi, which is sometimes hard to find at AYCE places. Quality of food and customer service was great. 

Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a sushi spot downtown."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place when I had a craving for sushi and it did not disappoint!

We had intended to get some items off the menu but wound up going with the AYCE option. The selection on the AYCE was not huge but it was good and offered some better items than most places, including a handful of their speciality rolls.

The server was friendly and attentive. Orders were made quickly and presented well. The dining room was very clean, as were the restrooms.

We left fully satisfied and I would happily go to this joint again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Really anticipated coming here based on the great reviews! My partner and I love sushi and we've found lots of great places to have amazing Japanese in Toronto. This place definitely didn't have the flavours of a 4 star restaurant. Unfortunately everything fell a little flat. First, the menu is smaller than other AYCE place. Small menus are okay if things are done well, but the rolls all looked kinda sad and didn't have any real flavour. The sashimi was okay at best, some of it was fishy, so we didn't have a bunch of it. I wouldn't come back for a la carte or AYCE, move along everyone..."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go again! The yelpers out there really disappointed me. I ordered a bunch of sushi but really got grossed out when the spicy salmon roll had really really tempura....i felt like I was biting on rocks!

The place is basic but flies were flying the whole time...pretty annoying experience"}
{"text":"Having lived literally a 2 min walk away from this place for several years, I've never been inclined to venture into it. It just seemed like one of the many jap places on Dundas that serve mediocre sushi and AYCE. Good thing one day I went in because I think it's one of the best value sushi places around.

My typical go to dish is L6 or L7 combos that come with the tempura. While the sushi is not bad, the tempura, I'd say is one of my favourites. Huge pieces of vegetable (yam, squash) and a pretty fresh tasting piece of shrimp. I've had shrimp tempura at AYCE that can often taste dry, chewy. The ones here actually taste pretty good and while the batter isn't super light, it has a very nice crunch/crispness to it.

The sushi pieces are average sizes and nothing to complain about. I do enjoy going to higher end sushi places but sometimes you just need a bit to satisfy the cravings and this restaurant definitely does it.

After checking it out that first time, I've been here countless times since (even for AYCE) and have not had a bad experience yet.

It's not a must try place, but if you're in the area and craving Japanese without wanting to spend a fortune, check this place out."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars/5) Let's be real here... when you're a mom and pop sushi joint a hop, skip, and a jump away from OCAD, don't expect 5-star service or premium quality.  I've been a couple of times for AYCE and a la carte.There's something homey and relaxing about eating there, even if it's not the best in the area. I've never had issues getting service, with 2-3 groups max on weekdays when I've gone. Imo the AYCE is more worth it than the regular menu,  especially because the quality is the same for both. I'd go if you're already in the area and don't want to wait for a table elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'd need to separate my review into two parts: Lunch and AYCE Dinner

Lunch (3 stars):
Because I work literally 30 seconds away from this place, this has been a very common place that my colleagues and I will go to for quick lunches and even meetings! I think the lunch specials are decent - reasonable pricing with reasonably okay food. Nothing too fancy or special, they have all the regular items a sushi restaurant would have. 

AYCE Dinner (1 star):
Definitely THE WORST AYCE I've ever been to! The menu, the service, the quality of food were horrible. The dinner menu had maybe 1/3 of a regular AYCE dinner and it's ridiculous considering they charge the same price as other restaurants. The service was very slow, considering there were only 2 tables filled and on top of that, the quality was just horrible. We had to send back several stuff back because they're not properly cooked. Shrimp tempura's batter was thick and soggy, chicken pieces were the tiniest I've ever seen. Sashimi/sushi weren't fresh at all. Fortunately the rolls weren't so bad and we really liked the spicy salmon roll. 

On average, I'll give this place 2 stars . I definitely will not be coming back for AYCE - but will come back on days I crave Japanese food for quick lunches."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! Went for AYCE dinner and salmon on Rainbow roll was fishy. I told the waitress that the salmon was fishy so I couldn't eat. She told the male Korean chef about it and he said \"Why did she lie to us instead of telling that she simply didn't want to eat anymore.\" and \"Tell her we charge for the leftovers.\" Wow. I could have more rolls if the food was ok and willing to pay for the leftovers but as I already said, the salmon was fishy and disgusting and I had to spit it out on the plate. After I paid and left, the chef yelled at me \"bakayaro\" which means \"asshole\" in English.
Apparently they didn't think I can understand Korean & Japanese but unfortunately I can and understood everything they said.
No customers on Saturday night and now I can understand why. Tried tempura, sashimi, rolls and hand roll but none of them was even OK.
Oh, and the table was sticky as hell."}
{"text":"Love this place. I visit them at least once a week. The fish is fresh, the sushi is delicious and the portions and combos are generous.

If you need a place for dinner before heading to the AGO or after visiting, and you don't have a lot of cash to fork out on FRANK restaurant, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Fresh warm sushi - super good service- reasonable sizes and price - best non-chalant sushi in the area - recommenddd"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Gallery Sushi. My friend had been looking for a good sushi place and found this one which had received pretty good rating. We ordered off the lunch menu, which had quite a few options to choose from. I had the vegetarian sushi plate which comes with miso soup and a salad. There was a selection of vegetarian sushi and tempura. It was a good portion size and everything tasted delicious. For the price this is a very good lunch offer! My friends were also happy with their meals."}
{"text":"This place is just alright. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Lunch prices are a little pricy. Meets the sushi craving and is close to my work, but Im never satisfied 100%. Not sure why..."}
{"text":"Recommended items : 
(In order of preference)

- dynamite roll
- salmon crunch 
- spicy salmon
- white tuna crunch 
- spicy tuna
- spider roll 
- black dragon
- red dragon
- green dragon

Must order these 9 items. For dessert go with the Red Bean and Green Tea Ice cream ."}
{"text":"New to Toronto/Ontario in general and was craving sushi. Decided to try this place for AYCE. The price isn't bad at all $19.99 for AYCE by myself. The menus decent and has the common kind of sushi/Japanese cusine. Not sure how big other places menus are as I haven't tried any other ones yet. They're enthentic Japanese owners and know what they're doing. The place is small but cozy. I've already went back for the second time myself."}
{"text":"The experience here was good overall. 
We loved the spicy salmon, the salmon pizza, and the salmon crunch roll. the dragon rolls weren't all that great.

finding parking for the place was hell, but that is expected when going to downtown core."}
{"text":"Great takeout special deal. Call ahead if you are in a hurry. You may need to wait. If you pay with cash, it is $6.50 for two rolls. There is a selection of rolls you can choose from. I usually go for the shrimp and California roll. The rolls are just enough for quick lunch"}
{"text":"If you want a deal, here's a place you can get them.

They have this 2 rolls for $5.50 (tax included) deal.
You can choose 2 rolls among the following:
California, Shrimp, Crab, Avocado, Asparagus, Yam, cucumber other veggies.

I usually get a shrimp & a california roll and you can't go wrong.
They are made fresh, I like how they season their rice.

Another good menu if you're a big fan of raw fish is their Chirashi.
They don't have a variety of fish in the Chirashi, they come with salmon, yellow fin tuna, fatty tuna, red snapper and some tobiko but the portions are really good for $9.95+tax. Fish is fresh, they even switch red snapper for salmon for free if you ask them. (good for salmon lovers).

They have an All-you-can eat option for $18.99 and the sushi is does not come with a fist full of rice, it's actually the same size as their regular sushi order!! although you can't order shrimp tempura by the pieces, if you like sushi, this is the place (they even have Tuna!!)

Not a fancy high end place, but very good for the money."}
{"text":"When I went the first time sushi was decent, but recently going there again sushi was just okay as in, you could get better sushi somewhere else with the same amount of $. Service was okay as well, lady was nice... Probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite AYCE sushi places in downtown Toronto. Their menu is very simple, and does not have the dim sum and teriyaki fusion dishes that so many other places are now going for. But the sushi that they do have is high quality, made to order in front of you, and delicious.

I have come here about once every month for a year now, and always order the same things on their menu: the spider roll, futo roll, sashimi, hand rolls, tempura banana, takoyaki, and then various little dishes. Their bento boxes for lunch are also great value.

The service is very friendly and attentive. They can sometimes be quite slow to bring out your order, but that's likely due to their small kitchen and staff, and the care they put into everything.

I greatly prefer Gallery sushi to the nearby Kyoto House, August 8, and Rosewood for AYCE sushi. Watch out though, they're closed on Sundays. 

Food and value 5/5
Service speed 3/5"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of sushi downtown since I live uptown which is the all you can eat sushi capital of the world but I felt the need for sushi during lunch and wound up here on a friend's recommendation. 

First off, the place is a bit of a dump. Floor falling apart, bathrooms falling apart, walls... falling apart. (I guess it is consistant.) but the staff was very friendly, (I think they were really japanese too) and the food was spectacular! 

10 bucks for a bento lunch box filled me right up. They have cheaper ones too if you are not a big guy like me. 

Get over the crappy building and enjoy some amazing sushi."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my gf. Comparable with other similar AYCE sushi in the area - higher quality food, very low ambiance. Nice family business - our lady server was very friendly. Sashimi specifically, was fresh, thick, and savoury. Shrimp tempura was breaded heavier then others. Would only come back for takeout next time."}
{"text":"Coming to Toronto I had good hopes. And Gallery sushi did not disappoint by any means. For $19.99  ALL YOU CAN EAT. You really can't go wrong.

When we arrived the outside looked kinda ghetto and unappealing but based off the original
Yelp reviews and the fact it was so cheap we gave it a shot. 

Inside is small, so I can definitely see it being at capacity and wait times a possibility 

We started off with some seaweed salad, takoyaki, shrimp tempura, calamari and miso soup. All which were decent quality for AYCE

For rolls I tried most of the staple ones
- spicy salmon (highly recommend)
- salmon crunch (must try)
- white tuna crunch (must try)
- spicy tuna
- BBQ eel 
- dynamite roll (always a favourite)
- dragon 
- black dragon
- red dragon
- green dragon
- spider roll

To my surprise the basic rolls delivered a much better taste than the special ones. And I really value places that give little rice and lots of fish, and Gallery did just that. 

I was super excited for sashimi . We ordered about 20 pieces of salmon as well as some white Tuna sashimi and all of which were fresh and flavourful. Because of the nature of AYCE. The sashimi was smaller sized but thick in size. About 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch. I wasn't too concerned with the size because I knew I could just order a boatload if I wanted to. Sashimi was very good quality and I throughly enjoyed the white tuna as well. 

For cooked dishes we just got the chicken teriyaki and beef. Which were also delightful. Everything was really good. Best bang for my buck for sure.

At the end I decided to total up my bill had I ordered off a regular menu and not the all you can eat.

We consumed about $120-140 worth of food and all I paid was $45 + tip so I'm definitely not complaining. I love AYCE not because I eat a lot. But because I'm able to enjoy a variety of dishes and items and because I can eat 10+ pieces of sashimi in a heartbeat. At ant regular sushi restaurant i would be paying an arm and a leg.!

Highly recommend. Would come again. Might actually hit it up once more before I leave Monday!"}
{"text":"Surprised that not many of my friends prefer this place over other AYCE sushi restaurants nearby such as Kyoto House. The rice to fish ratio is great for this small restaurant and for the price, it can't be beat. The spicy salmon roll is jam packed with salmon and a thin layer of rice and is probably the best I've eaten in any other AYCE sushi restaurant. 

They do have a take out special, 2 rolls for 6-7 bucks but it's not any rolls (you gotta choose from the list). I've always had quick and good service here, whether it was dining in or taking out. The decor needs some work as it does look a little rundown but hey, I'm here to stuff my face."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior and interior fool you folks this place is a hidden gem. I came to this place twice while on vacation and had the all you can eat sushi to order, everything was delicious and the employees are so nice!"}
{"text":"Usually deserted, I was afraid to visit this Sushi joint in the Village by the Grange. I finally overcame my fears and got some takeout. Good call. For $5.50 you get 2 x 6 rolls (that's 12) in a number of options: California, crab salad, shrimp, yam, squash, asparagus, veggie, avocado and cucumber. I have yet to dine here and try sashimi and other options, but I will someday.

Obligatory Title Pun: Sushi GALL-ore.

Menu Readability: I'm only familiar with their quaintly hand-printed sandwich board.

Need to mention: They offer all-you-can-eat every single day.

What this place teaches me about myself: It shouldn't take me over a year to work up the nerve to eat at a sushi place."}

AMBIENCE
Small, quaint place with a open kitchen where the sushi chefs craft the foods.
Approximate capacity about 50.
The furnishings are a little outdated.
The bathroom just clean, but not really.

SERVICE
It was ok service, there was one waitress.
She got us things when we asked for it.
She didn't automatically fill out teas or check-in if we need anything.
Nothing above and beyond.

LOCATION
Close to St. Patrick station.
10 minute walk from Eaton Centre.

FOOD QUALITY
We opted for the AYCE dinner menu.
Calamari - batter was too thick but the calamari was soft and not overly seasoned.
Shrimp tempura - good and what I expected.
Beef teriyaki - wasn't crispy, but did have the teriyaki flavours and was soft and not overlooked.
Agedashi Tofu - same batter was the calamari.  Was not very hot when served.
Wakame Salad - very salty, otherwise good texture and fresh.
Miso Soup - very salty, otherwise all the right components.
Salmon Sashimi - Fresh! Nicely sliced.  
Butterfish Sashimi - Fresh! Nicely sliced.
Avocado+Cucumber Handroll, Eel+Avocado Handroll, Spicy Salmon Handroll - more than good, good rice texture and well seasoned.
Tako Sushi, Tamago Sushi, Spicy Salmon Sushi, Unagi Sushi - good good.
Green tea ice cream with banana tempura - good!

This place overall was good and there are areas of improvement that can attract more business.  The price is fair for dinner.  

Probably will try this place on a busier night to see if that might generate a menu of all fresh and hot items."}
{"text":"Commenting for dinner AYCE during weekday night.

Their short menu is made up by delicious sushi. Personally I'd prefer more extensive menu for AYCE, but if you're quality over quantity person, go for it.

Also, if you look at the menu, it's like they allow the customers to order each item 3 times only. I'm not sure for fact that they do this, so double check with the place.

Update: The current price for AYCE (as of April 2018) is $23+tax."}
{"text":"I've been searching for years for my next AYCE sushi spot, and unfortunately this is not it. :(

20.99 for AYCE is actually not bad at all and very cheap, but I was expecting a little more in terms of quality. They had all the AYCE basics including dynamite, spider, green dragon, etc. and I was even surprised they had takoyaki and chicken katsu! This was a really great find because even some of the best and expensive restaurants in Markham don't offer them. Why I rate them only 3 is because the portions for some of the anticipated dishes such as teriyaki chicken and steak were soooo small. Like little slivers. I also left full, but not satisfied. Ever had that feeling? Service was very good and attentive. Wait times were minimal. 

I give gallery sushi 3-3.5/5. The unique finds and service were really great, but I was not completely satisfied. I would come back again though, perhaps to try their bento boxes."}
