{"text":"Burgers better than In-n-Out, Fatburger, or any place I have ever been to. The burritos are good, and the pizza is really good. Try their mushroom pizza it is great!  Don't listen to what these pansy weenies say, this area is not unsafe at all, even at night."}
{"text":"We come to this happy hole in the wall just about every time we've gotta be on this side of town. Easy service, and food that has been consistently great or at worst very good every time we've been by. $3.50 Hawaiian, and $5 pastrami: just the right seared crust on the patty, and just the right softness in that bread.  A part of me would like to give 4 1/2 stars for unimpressive drink options, or the kinda sketchy local experience ? today we had a guy walk in and work some hustle trying to sell cheap perfume to diners ? but even with those little reservations, I just plain love this place and always look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my family for the first time. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious! The two young guys at the counter were clean cut and very polite. I think this place is family owned and I love to support the locals! Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"What a great family owned place! Food was delish! Way better and way cheaper than Fatburger. Love supporting local businesses. Go check them out !"}
{"text":"My first time in Vegas and the 40th for my boyfriend. We wanted to try something local. Frigg'n awesome pizza!! Manny and the young girl who took our order were nice and chatted us up. Definitely recommended!!! Oh and when were stuffing our faces Manny was making a burger that we wanted to attack but we were so full from the large pizza"}
{"text":"One of the best hamburgers I have ever had. The boyger was fresh and delicious. The staff friendly and the service was fast. If you like hamburgers you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"What a very well kept secret- burgers are perfect! Tried their wings and by far some of the best wings around! Will definitely be returning when a burger is what I am craving !"}
{"text":"great place absolutely love the Boygers"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it.  Tried for the first time today.  Friendly service and good food.  Lived only minutes from it for a year.  You have to know it is there.  Corner of Stewart and Lamb behind a tire place, in a small strip mall.  Prices are reasonable, too."}
{"text":"My wife and I live right down the street and have drove by Fatboys several times. We usually do not eat fast food but we decided to give it a try. It was very good! We had the pastrami burger and it was amazing."}
{"text":"To be filed in the 'shady part of town' category, I recently visited Fat Boy Restaurant in the north east part of town. You can thank me now; I risked life and limb to increase my cholesterol level and try one more burger for you all to read about. I came across Fat Boy in a recent Yelp post about burgers along with a few other oddball places that are high on my list to try. It's not very often that I drive into the depths of North Las Vegas for anything, let alone a burger, so this better have been worth it. Was it?  The restaurant itself is small, with only 6 tables and a counter that separates the dining area from the twice as big kitchen area behind it. Do not expect anything fancy when coming here, but I doubt you would after what you've just driven through to get there or by opening your eyes and looking at the half-deserted strip mall it resides in. The owners decided to play off the word 'boy' in their menu, which is in everything from their boyrritos (burritos) to boygers (burgers). The menu also has wings, pizza, Philly cheese steaks, and almost anything else you can think of.  I thought I would keep it fairly simple and ordered the double Boyger meal, complete with everything: mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, relish and mustard. Now it may be the relish talking, but if there was a contest to replicate the Fatburger burger this would win hands down. The patties had great beef flavor, not quite as peppery and crispy as a Fatburger would be, but still very good. The bun was a bit thin but grilled nice and crispy, and proportioned perfectly. The toppings were all fresh, well-proportioned and complemented each other, a lot like a Fatburger would be with everything on it. Overall this was a surprise meal based on my surroundings and the loud Mexican accordion music playing in the background.  My fat fries were good; seasoned with something I couldn't quite identify, probably a typical fry seasoning. They were mostly cooked well, with a couple slightly soggy ones as often happens with fat fries. The portion wasn't that big, probably the only downside to the meal. The price for a combo meal comes in at $6.98, which is probably half of what it would have cost for the same thing at Fatburger. If you love that exact flavor and are willing to take a drive then definitely come check this place out. If you've had enough of Fatburger and don't need to try the same thing, or just don't want to risk getting carjacked, you may want to avoid Fat Boy."}
{"text":"New to the Vegas area so I have been using yelp to decide on new places to eat, fat boy had pretty good reviews so today my family and I decided to eat there. Glad we made the choice! It was delicious we had pastrami sandwiches and asada fries, can't wait to go back and try some different menu items! Also really good customer service, they hollered at us as we left to thank us and tell us to have a good day, you don't see that often anymore!"}
{"text":"Great little local restaurant. The menu is extensive and it has all the savory goodies one could hope for. Lots of hamburgers to choose from, as well as sandwiches and pizzas. The price is incredibly reasonable considering what you get. I love Fat Boy."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I always order something different & 100% I am satisfied. The burgers are amazing. I have no complaints whatsoever. This is one of the best places in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Burgers taste amazing! Favorite thing on the menu is the chencho fires. If you have not tried the chencho fries, your missing out. Today I bought pizza for the first time and I'm excited to try it since I've heard great things about their pizza!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have this Sunday eat out day and I can say I usually never drive back to the same place twice in a week, but I have made the exception with Fat Boy. They have delicious juicy burgers that are a must try! Everything is homemade style & sure taste like it."}
{"text":"This was the second time my partners and I have visited Fatboy. Our initial visit resulted in full bellies and big smiles!   This time we actually drove out of our way to experience this dining masterpiece! Once again we were met with great service, friendly smiles, and exceptional food.  I am a glutton for punishment so I once again decided to have a double monster boyger with cheese and bacon. This time however I added an egg! If your are faint of heart do not attempt to eat this entire burger, as it should (could) be shared.   This tiny little restaurant has quite possibly the best burger I have ever eaten. Maybe someday I'll try one of the other items on the menu. I'm sure they are yummy as well'"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, their burgers have a great taste and their chencho fries always hit the spot, highly recommended! They're all friendly here"}
{"text":"Straight-ahead burger joint. Casual, not fancy.  My boy and I came in for some burgers and were not disappointed. I had a protein-style burger with cheese and bacon. Burger was cooked perfectly and had a really nice flavor. Fresh lettuce, mayo, and pickles topped it off.  I'd highly recommend the place for a quick burger fix. Service was also fast and friendly.   I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly staff. A little pricey. Good quality of food. My cheeseburger was delicious. Will definitely be back and recommend. Only compaint,my fries were a little oversalted with seasoning,but still very tasty."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place! I rarely write reviews for restaurants but this is an exception. My boyfriend discovered fat boys after a long day of work and decide that the ratings were good enough to give it a shot. The chicken fingers are the best I think I've ever had and my boyfriend loves their boygers and pastrami sandwich I now eat her like twice a week. The cashier Also has exceptional customer service skills. She treats each and every customer like the restaurant is her own house and they're her guests. She is amazing. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. It has awesome food and is very inexpensive. Be prepared for little atmosphere inside but the food is fantastic. Order the pastrami boyger."}
{"text":"So, after reading reviews of this place on yelp I decided I had to try it. I have been trying to find the real best burger in Las Vegas and I know it ain't on the strip. We entered and were greeted by a nice young man who immediately took our order. We got 2 bacon cheeseboygers and shared an order of fries.  The meat in the burger was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and seasoned perfectly. The bacon was crispy and all the ingredients went well together. The burger was reminiscent of a Fatburger with regards to toppings and the way it is put together. 5 stars.  The fries were hot and had seasoned salt on them so they kind of reminded me of Farm Basket fries, another 5 stars. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they offer chili verde on their mexican food but didn't know what a green chile was when I asked if I could have one on my burger. I had to go on and describe it as an anaheim chile then my gf said Ortega chile and the lady knew what we meant but sadly no green chiles for the burgers (kind of makes me wonder where they get the chili verde from if not from green chiles). I would totally recommend the burgers and I will go back to try the chencho fries (fries with green chile, cheese and chopped chicken) and have already recommended them to friends."}
{"text":"I rarely review anything. This place is honestly great. Everything is great and the prices are good. They deserve business."}
{"text":"came here on recommendation from my brother who said it was bomb lol...went with the hubby & son ...it was super small inside kind of felt claustrophobic ...awkward since my son is only 1 hes noisy so everyone looks at u .....the service was great! food not so much decent prefer over micky ds any day but fatburger is way better with bigger portions...i got the bacon cheese burger i believe with chencho fries & they where sloppyed made & cold to top it all off.... it was decent good but i was let down because the chencho fries lookd so  good =/ maybe it was an off day"}
{"text":"Read the great reviews so I headed over to taste for myself. Food first: Fat Boy does make a tasty hamburger. I had a cheese boyger with bacon and an egg (perfectly fried over hard) and fat fries combo for $8 something. It was definitely a 4 star burger for the price. About on par with the Fatburger chain, but a Fatburger combo with bacon and egg is like $13 bucks. And that makes Fat Boy a spot-on 4 star! The owners/workers were prompt and friendly and know how to do burgers on a flattop. But the dining area is small and lackluster which drops the overall score down. But the food is what you'll go for, and this is definitely a worthy stop if you're on that side of town."}
{"text":"Love this family owned-and-operated place. So much better than the franchise joints like 5 Guys and Smash Burger that seem to get all the publicity. These burgers are what Fat Burger used to be before it went downhill. Perfectly cooked patties, a little crisp around the edges, on a nice lightly toasted bun that holds up to the fix in's. If you like Fat Burger, you'll fall in love with Fat Boy. (I've also tried the chicken Philly, and it was darned good, too.) Plus they smile and wave and say \"Welcome back\" when you walk in the door. Great prices, too. What a deal!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Food is excellent and prices are reasonable! Very friendly folks run the place! Do yourself and your family a favor and go there soon. Large menu with all kinds of good things for kids and adults."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here the young man at the counter was very polite we had pizza,wings,a monster bacon cheese burger,chencho fries and a veggie burger. The food was served up fast by the same polite young man and cooked to perfection by I think his father who was also polite which is very important to me, my family and I have been to other family owned places that think they can be as rude as they want since they own it and there are no repercussions.I will definitely be going back to try something new. They have a great variety of food on their menu. This is a must try place and since it's family owned and operated makes it that much more special"}
{"text":"Bought 2 large pizzas 1 cheese 1 pepperoni 2 ranch price came up to @ $18. 00?!?  Pizza wasn't even that good!! Total rip off! !"}
{"text":"It was sooooo good. Chencho fries were bomb-not too spicy, which I like. Also had a cheeseBOYger w/bacon. All made fresh, with friendly staff, great prices, and free drink refills-what's not to like? Maybe the location, but if this place was anywhere fancy-the prices wouldn't be as low. Will definitely be back next time we are craving burgers!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I've never tried a burger that good I recommend the Monster cheese burger!"}
{"text":"Something about this place is so addicting! Love their pizza and mozzarella sticks. They are always friendly and accommodating as well, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. . Think fat boy took my order looks like a fat 12yearolder lol"}
{"text":"Rip off. Ordered the 4 fingers and onion rings and got 3.1 fingers and 4 onion rings. 0/10 would recommend. Would have complained in person but I got uber eats because lazy. Hope they lose business over ripping me off. Made a yelp just to write them a bad review, fatboy sucks is my yelp name."}
{"text":"Fat Boy has surprised us. A solid tasty burger and fry options. We love their breakfast burritos, but the portion on the carne asada fries is disappointing when you are used to Faustos or Robertos."}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS good. Chencho fries are the BOMB. Will continue to come here as long as they are open!"}
{"text":"We googled hamburger joint and fat boy popped up. Let me tell you boy am I glad. BEST burgers in town hands down!"}
{"text":"Just about everything here is cool only if you don't mind becoming a fat boy (if you are not one already)."}
{"text":"Best burger place in town ! HANDS DOWN!!! Super friendly staff and food to die for !!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good food, great service. Don't be persuaded by those who left bad reviews...been to this place 2x, had the mild chicken fingers & pastrami sandwich...and everything was great. The speciality fries were awesome. Very reasonably priced. Don't pass up on this place you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went to Fatboy to get a turkey burger today and it was pretty good & the price $2.99 was even better....also had the chencho fries which were also good & cost $2.99...overall I had a good experience & I will return to try something else from their menu."}
{"text":"Great place with a broad menu. Awesome fat fries. Made fresh so call ahead if in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Came here with my husband and had a fantastic veggie burger. Staff was extremely friendly..hopefully owner can retain these employees. They're half the reason I'd come back. Prices are reasonable and food was awesome. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good chili cheese fries place. I finally found it! This place hit the spot! Of course this place is also known for its boyger, so I had to grab one. You'll have to grab one if you're going to get the chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this location! I've always loved and ordered from the original whenever I'm in the neighborhood and I can only hope they can open even more! I was able to order online from my phone and my order was ready and waiting when I arrived. The staff is super friendly and professional, the environment inviting and simple, the place is clean and, most importantly, the food is delicious! If  you want a straight up good burger with out all the unnecessary frilly camouflage come here, order it with chencho fries and you have a great meal!! I love good ol family run businesses and burger joints just like the neighborhood hangouts back home in L.A.!!"}
{"text":"This the fisrt time we ate here,my son found this on yelp it reminds me of the hamburger places back in Cali the pastrami was good and the bun was was soft he loved his burger we will be back to try breakfast."}
{"text":"Have a craving for a delish burger with fresh ingredients ?  COME HERE!!!!  The only thing that bothered me was that I had NO idea this place existed. The bread was warm and incredibly soft, the patty well grilled and tasty and forget the chencho fries.....what? your mind will be extremely confused but happy you tried it.  Yes, it is a small establishment, and it may be hard to find sitting during peak hours, but service is fast and people are pleasant. You can definitely feed a family of four for about 25 dollars, and everyone will be FULL and HAPPY!!   Almost 20 years on the east side and just discovered this little burger-heaven......  I had the double boyger with guacamole and my husband the Hawaiian boyger with a friend egg, both extremely tasty!!! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, pastrami burgers, chicken quesadilla, and green chilli cheese chicken fries. Everything was awesome. Service was friendly and quick.  Awesome experience."}
{"text":"This Double Boyger is so   Reminds me of a Hawkin's Burgers in LA Can't wait to try something else on the menu.  (They don't have a drive thru)"}
{"text":"Fatboy has such amazing food! Everything they serve is very delicious. I really love ordering their pastrami burgers. Best family business I've been too. Better than farmer boys and five guys!  Everyone there treats me like family especially the cashier.  They are always happy to see me and actually remember me and always crack jokes and we  catch up.  I highly recommend coming here! You wont regret it! Best food you'll have around!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the burger spots in California. A very tiny seating area. Their cheeseburger and fries are usually what I get. They've also got chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"I've came here 3 times and it is definitely worth coming to. I ordered the Pastrami sandwhich. The portions are huge and it's also not soaked with mustard. The is definitely great. Also walking into this place I've seen nothing but welcoming energy! I'd definitely recommend this place. It's almost hidden if you haven't been here before! Wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for yelp!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER  & FRIES IN VEGAS HANDS DOWN!!  All of my neighbors have been talking about it non-stop. I went down and had a double cheeseburger with bacon, fat fries, and a vanilla shake. WOW everything was SO GOOD!! The Food is fresh, made to order and it is fantastic! Not to mention everyone there is warm and friendly. Run don't walk, get down to Fatboy!!"}
{"text":"Okay people, you're all on crack!  I would take a double double anytime over this place, it's just an average burger joint...nothing special.    Here's a tip: For $1 extra to add cheese on each burger you order, just do yourself a favor and order an extra burger and put on the cheese yourself at home since the burgers are small.  A successful business makes it by word of mouth, value, and customer service... not by jacking up the prices!"}
{"text":"I love this place...... so glad they came to Henderson....great burgers and great friendly staff. Best place ever!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered an Asada Burrito and chilli cheese fries. The burrito was overloaded with beans and rice and worst of all, it had a literal hamburger patty cut into pieces instead of traditional asada. The fries were oddly cut and dry served on a small dish. Won't be back, and do not recommend because it's the worst burrito I've ever had."}
{"text":"I friggin love the Chencho fries!! This place is amazing & cheap. The Hawaian BOYger is dank too. Must try when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious charbroiled burger, you must try Fat Boy!! It's the only place in LV that compares to the burgers in Los Angeles!!! This will definitely be our go to when we are craving burgers! I love that it's a family owned mom and pop spot. The customer service was excellent and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Killer handmade burgers (boygers) that are always delicious and full of flavor, with crispity fries (fat or skinny) dashed with a seasoning. I recently had their pizza and that was awesome too and at a great price, different toppings to choose from and served hot and fresh (I could see steam coming through the sides of the pizza box). Chocolate shake was gooood. One of the few gems on the east side of Las Vegas, go there!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had pastrami boyger and it hit all my taste buds! Nice clean restaurant highly recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try something new and fell in love with the food. Amazing taste in the pastrami burger i highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Just my poysonal opinion but, this is my first time here and this place was great! Bernie is the man though. He was super patient and helpful as we ordered. Even after we placed our order he continued to help us with drinks and whatever we needed.   My girl and I ordered a Pastrami Boyger, Chencho Fries and Wings. The Boyger was so bombbb! Flavorful and tasty. Lowkey, I'd eat here over In N' Out. The Chencho fries get boring after a few bites so I'd recommend getting more toppings like eggs, bacon or pastrami. Get em all. Wings were alright. I got half BBQ and half Buffalo. If you come here I'd definitely pick a burger or try one of their burritos over the wings.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal and experience here. 4 stars just because the wings were not that great. But good food and great service definitely calls for more stars. Will update again upon my next visit."}
{"text":"This has probably the best old school style chicken tenders and fries. We usually order online, use Apple Pay and pick up. Super easy and very delicious! They are very good about having the food ready when you arrive. Also, what's cool is when you pick up a to go order of chicken and fries, it comes in a big box wrapped in foil. Nice and hot! And they load you up with tons of ranch! Two thumbs up for these dudes!!"}
{"text":"Thank you again fellow yelpers for pointing me to this amazing burger joint. I had the pastrami boyger was best burger  I've had in years!!!!! My son even enjoyed it and he does not like to many things so that is saying a lot."}
{"text":"I am beyond impressed with the service and food. It would be an understatement to say the food was AMAZING! I was pleasantly surprised to see my 3 yr  old ate all her food. I highly recommend taking your family to Fat Boys."}
{"text":"So i came here with a strong recommendation from a friend.  When i got here i thought no way this is going to be good. Well let me tell you never judge a book by its cover.  I tried the burger and my friend had the pizza. The burger was unreal good, so i stole a slice from my friends pizza that was awesome too! Pizza at a burger joint really yes really and its good. Service was good too no disapointments here your going to love it!  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Boy for lunch because I wanted a good burger at a fair price.  Ended up with a great burger for a fair price.  The staff was very helpful and attentive seeing that it was my first time at the place.  I looked at the menu and had a hard time deciding but ended up with the Monster Pastrami Burger.  Plenty of other items to try next time and there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"Honestly there are times when I just crave the flavorful patty of this place. On a whim I went in there and came out really happy. This place could use a touch up but the food is good"}
{"text":"I've decided to stop going to Fat Boys. The cook was not using gloves and grabbing the cheese and lettuce with his bare bands. He even touched his hair to get it out of his face. I asked why he wasn't wearing gloves and he said when they cook the food that all the germs will be killed. I asked what about the lettuce then. Well, I won't be going back there. It's a real shame because they have some good burgers, which I have a hard time finding around here."}
{"text":"I love their burgers, and since I do, I don't want to try anything else there. I'm often like that with food. Next time I'm going to have to branch out and try something else. Maybe the Philly? I sometimes can't make up my mind as to whether I prefer their burgers over In & Out burgers. I like how they grill their buns and they have crispy edges. I'm not fond of chopped lettuce, though, but it obviously doesn't bother me too much because I still love the burgers. The service is always great with friendly people. This is a mom-&-pop-run place with the other restaurant on the east side."}
{"text":"Its so good and the food looks so tasty... Love here.. This place does sell real hamburgers nothing like the others... Also they have this hot and really tasty chicken fingers.. I just love this food"}
{"text":"Oh man, the burgers here are better than In-and-Out. They must cook the meat patties in extra doses of love or something because it didn't take me long at all to wolf down mine.  I ordered the guacamole burger with everything on it, along with their seasoned steak fries. Typical fries, delicious burger. I also ordered the Caesar salad, which was the usual fare. The lettuce was super fresh and crisp, which won me over. The plate wasn't drowned in dressing, either,  which was a relief.   My aunt ordered the beef mix, which came with tortillas, rice and beans. These beans had substance! I was very pleased to see that they were the perfect balance of solids and liquids. They weren't soup; nor were they a paste. The beef was very Hispanic in its flavors: spicy, salty, aromatic.   I recommend this place wholeheartedly if you find yourself in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The burgers here are life. Imagine in and out quality but more customizable, i mean just about anything mushrooms jalapeños bacon EVEN a fried egg and the chencho fat fries are a must. Its a great hole in the wall and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for a quaility burger."}
{"text":"I am picky about burgers because I grew up eating them from a little family run burger joint where my mom worked for 17 years. My husband wanted burgers and Yelp led us here. I was in love from the first bite!!! I ordered the Hawaiian burger without mayo and it had just enough sauce to be flavorful where most places drown the burger. My zucchini fries were crisp and the thickness kept the breading from overpowering the taste of the zucchini. Seriously coveted my husbands steak fries but they were graded too good to share. Soon figured out that the cashier and the person who brought in the bun delivery were the owners! Was thrilled to give our business to a smaller locally owned restaurant versus the corporate franchises on the strip."}
{"text":"nothing special about this place.  I just happened to be on this side of town, and I remembered hearing about FAT BOY boygers.. Well it was a huge disappointment.  I just got the Double Boyger, with Fat Fries..  daughter got the wings (tasted ALL tapatio).  Maybe other things are good on the menu, but i wasn't impressed. Service was really slow, but they were very attentive and made sure you were taken care of while you waited for your food.  I probably won't be going back, but if I ever do.. I will have to try the Pastrami, or something else on their menu.  Oh, and we also tried to Chenco fries.. which wasn't bad, but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Mac says Fatboy Boygers is The Best Genuine Hamburger Place on W Horizon Ridge Pkwy  Very Clean place and very polite and courteous service to customers  Abel, Leyly, Nancy, and Estevan  and Family are great friendly people giving the best of Old School 1950's Hamburgers that taste fresh milkshakes are great and smoothes too. It's all good and that's hard to find in a \" fast food world today when you order something and it comes out cold\" But not here it comes out Hot and fresh and taste fantastic  Please try Fatboy for  authentic Real Mexican Food and Pizzas try The Monster Boygers and Pastrami Boyger, also the Breakfast Boyrittos! Love there Fatboy Fries and you have to try their Pastrami Chili Cheese Fries, Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the spicy chicken sandwich  You will be pleasantly Surprised"}
{"text":"We came down to Nevada from California. Tried both location and both locations did not disappoint us. My kids loved it. Customer service is awesome. Can't wait to come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really friendly family owned spot. Food is really good and the sizes are good for the price. Good find."}
{"text":"Put this little place on your burger radar! Friendly service, delicious burgers.  Prices were very family friendly and servings filled up our family!"}
{"text":"their food is great! I love the chicken fingers it was cooked perfect. my kids had chicken wings and pizza they loved it. it's good place to eat."}
{"text":"My family has been here several times. The food is fresh and tastes amazing. Since the burgers are made to order it takes a little time to get your order, but well worth the wait. If you're in a hurry, then just call ahead. The people who work here are super nice. They always go out of their way to make you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Love this place! When I first moved here I went twice in one week not just because the food was delicious but they even remembered my name and my order after only 2 visits! Abel and Nancy are very sweet and provide both top of the line customer service as well as the best burger in Henderson (gotta love that double monster patty!)"}
{"text":"Great burger joint!  The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The owner was cooking and employees were very friendly and helpful. Nice alternative to chain burger joints. We will be back."}
{"text":"I got a cheese boyger and some chencho fries... it was amazing! Everything is made to order so it's fresh. There's not a lot of dining room area so if you're rollin' deep be prepared to run out of room. The boyger itself reminded me of an In and Out burger. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 11-1-13 around 1:00 pm, no one inside. We all had different items on the menu to include the double cheese boyger, double monster cheese boyger, chicken wings (hot) and a wet burrito with red sauce. Chencho fries and regular fries. All items were good but the stand out here are the boygers made fresh to order and very tasty. The double monster is huge, had to share it to finish it. Staff was friendly and attentive even when they got busy after about 20 minutes. Don't pay $16-$20 on the strip for a burger that is not his good. Worth the trip but you will need a car. I will be back here."}
{"text":"Took my wife and kids to eat here. Good pastrami sandwich and friendly staff. You can expect back kere again"}
{"text":"Best burgers around and outstanding customer service from all who work here. Good to see they opened a new location in Henderson. Hoping for more to come!"}
{"text":"Usually not one to leave a review but this place definitely deserves it. Fantastic friendly service accompanied with delicious food. I have came here a couple times already and I always leave satisfied no matter what I order. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We found this place today thanks to Yelp! Picked up Cheese steaks and Onion rings.  The food and the prices are Great!!! (The bread/bun is amazing)  So excited this place is in the neighborhood. We'll be back soon to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Was interested in checking this place out. The pictures on yelp all looked great and it was well hyped on the Nextdoor website by people in the area. Went right at noon. Found the experience very ordinary. Decided to order a Double Cheese Boyger, chilli cheese fries, and a vanilla shake. Was going to order separately but the kid working the counter tried to enter it as a combo and had to get assistance to ring me up. The price was the same as if I ordered separately so not sure why he didn't want to go that route.  Then the wait began. Took about 15 mins to receive my food even though there were only a couple of tables that were there before me and not eating. I was not in a rush so it wasn't a huge deal.  The food itself was kinda blah. The chili on the chili cheese fries was very bland. So much so I actually had to add some ketchup to give it some flavor. Ketchup on chili cheese fries! Also the real ice cream milk shake was soupy and tasted very watered down. The highlight of the meal was the boyger which was decent. I would liken it to a Fatburger taste wise but more moist (which is the reason I don't go to Fatburger because I find their burgers dry). I ordered it with all the toppings. Was it enough to make me want to come back? Not really. I mean for a total of $13.64, I felt a double double animal style, animal fries, and shake from In N Out would have been much tastier and probably cheaper and faster.  NOTE: if you are like me and don't like burgers that are really think and obscure the taste of condiments and bun, go with a single. By the time I got to the middle of the double boyger, all I could really taste was meat (thankfully it was tasty). I am not sure how the monster boyger or double monster compare but pretty sure if I do go back, I would just order a single."}
{"text":"Great food and love the friendly environment!!! Excellent customer service and great prices on all there food. Also they have their own mix to classic recipes like chencho fries which are great. Love there family packs a great eat for all the family."}
{"text":"First time visit and could not be more satisfied. I had the double cheese boyger and my wife had a single cheese with ham. Skinny fries. So darn good. Best of all, their service was nice, timely, and friendly. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I tryed their fries the other day. and they were yummy. thank you for the great food.  my daughter loved her hamburger.. wonderful staff. great price. and excellent food. we really enjoyed being there. Aloha."}
{"text":"It's not fancy, it's in a strip mall but FAT BOY makes a quite excellent burger or \"Boyger\" as they call em~    I have to admit I was not expecting to much and was HAPPILY surprised! Very similar to a home made burger ~ nicely prepared cooked to order with onions (raw or grilled), pickles, lettuce & ketchup PLUS a nice fresh bun make for a nice meal.     2 options for fries steak cut or skinny (which we ordered) we VERY GOOD served nice, hot & crispy with a little dash of spicy seasoning.    Lots of options besides burgers  pizza, salad, burritos, chicken nuggets etc.     Check out Fat Boy on Horizon Ridge across from the US Post Office"}
{"text":"Love the Phillys here! Mary always gives great customer service and a warm welcome hard to find customer service like this in Vegas"}
{"text":"Very good burgers and pizza.  Just a terrible location.  A hooker tried to chat me up."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Fat Boy. . .I tried the Pastrami Boyger; it lived up to every expectation. A great juicy burger fried up fresh while you wait! No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I was in that part of town and craving pastrami. This was the karst place and had great yelp reviews. The pastrami and phili steak both suck.  The pastrami is fatty and chewy.  Very poor quality   The phili beef was nothing exciting and flavorless."}
{"text":"Definitely a Vegas favorite. The family that owns the business is INCREDIBLY kind and the food is delicious. I'm personally not a huge fan of big filling meals but I will totally splurge when I go to FB. My favorite so far is the guacamole burger with skinny fries. The also have $5.99 medium pizza with one topping, which is also very good and cheap. My boyfriend likes the wet boyrito with the red sauce the best! Five stars for being a really great, family owned hole in the wall. No complaints at all, by far."}
{"text":"Love this little joint! A true family run business that's always clean, fresh and delicious. Prices are right, portions are good"}
{"text":"I can not believe I never gave a review for this place, shame on me!!!! This place is legit, staff is very friendly, prices are reasonable and the food is DELICIOUS! I need to visit more often but I'm trying to try more new places :)"}
{"text":"We came in here on a Saturday coming back from Hoover Dam. (We were on vacation from San Diego). As soon as we walked in we were greeted by all the employees behind the counter. The place was super clean and very inexpensive. My son and I had the double cheeseburger with skinny and steak fries which was delicious. My wife had a regular cheeseburger, and my daughter the pastrami sandwich. (Sorry no pics, we were starving and the food looked delicious).    After we finished and were leaving they all said bye to us and said thank you for coming in from behind the counter. We loved the food so much we came in for lunch again the next day. One of the workers (Jose) remembered us from the previous day and even called me by my name since we're tocayos. Next time we're in town we will definitely be back! Two thumbs up all the way from San Diego!     Great people, great service, and great food! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the special....2 med. pizzas and some wings. The wings were okay, but the pizzas were fantastic. We will be back soon. Thanks."}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazingly good food. The service is beyond awesome, they are so friendly and respectful.  I really love coming here when I'm over on the East side.  The pastrami burger is amazing and any variety of the way they make their fries is delicious. Yesterday I had the mozzarella bacon BBQ fries, wow so good!"}
{"text":"I went to Fat Boy once and had a single burger. Great service and a great burger. It was done perfect. They use good buns also. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I will definitely be coming back here.  The food is made to order and everything is fresh.  The restaurant is a little whole in the wall on the east-side, but the food is great.  I ordered a boyger with skinny fries, it was similar to fat burger."}
{"text":"We had the Hawaiian and veggie burgers with fat fries. Everything was so delicious, fresh and cheap. Would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat. If you like pastrami then get your butt over here now and get some. The Pastrami Boyger is great but the pastrami sandwich on its own is just brilliant. It isn't \"The Hat\" but it will damn do! The owners are super cool and make everything when you order it. The guy is pretty nice about customizing orders too. You can call your order in for pick up or eat inside. They have a pizza special that costs just over $5 and it tastes great. My wife ordered some of their Chencho Fries and we ended up sharing it because I liked it. It is simple but the green sauce and cheese taste great on them. You can't beat the cheap prices for the quality you get here. What are you waiting for? Get over here and try something... just save some pastrami for me!"}
{"text":"Good cheap greasy food! Cencho fries were awesome. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great simple food with great customer service.  Family owned and operated adds to the experience.  If you live nearby you need to try it."}
{"text":"I sort of dread that time of time of day when the ever so mass thought provoking is asked....\"So, where are we gonna eat?\"  Such a question can often result in an indecision, disagreement, waffling, hate, depression and sometimes joy and happiness.  No one really ever wants to be responsible for decision of that magnitude.  I threw out my choice and attempted to stick to my guns but then something strange happened....What's this!  My boss, a non-yelper (but enjoys the benefits of reading the reviews of others) pulled out his smart phone and fired up the oracle that is yelp and said, \"How about Fat Boy?\"  Rarely do we make it over to this side of town and because he yelped it, I could not refuse and it is a damn good thing I offered no resistance.  Fat Boy is a small and somewhat obscure business located in the Northeast corner of Stewart and Lamb.  God, knows I would never of found it or had the pleasure of dining there had it not been for yelp and my bosses determination to not dine at another establishment.  Be WARNED!  The inside is rather small but then again so is the pearl inside inside an oyster.  One might want to call ahead to know if it's busy inside.  We arrived at or around high noon and were able to get a table for five, as another group was leaving.  I noticed there a lot of take out action occurring.  The menu has much to order in way of traditional American i.e., burgers and such.  There is also a few Mexican items to order along with pizza.  I went with the with double cheese \"boyger\" which consisted of two (what appeared to be) home made patties.  I also threw on a fried egg along with some bacon for goos measure.  This burger is on the top of my list of BEST burgers I have ever eaten.  Everything was super fresh and an absolute JOY to eat.  I watched friends devour the monster version of this \"boyger\" and was initially jealous and wanting more.  However, on this particular day, I was happy with what I ordered.  The \"Chencho Fries\" were a nice compliment to meal.  Steak or skinny fires smothered with a sort of green sauce with chicken and cheese.  Delicious!  FB has been around for five years and because of yelp, I have only recently discovered it.  If I had been aware of existence when it first opened....I am sure I would have already had my first and possibly second heart attack.  I am destained to tempt such a fate again in very near future."}
{"text":"Having fallen in love with the original location a few years ago, and respecting the hard working owners, I was tickled pink when I heard of this Henderson location.  Having not been a resident of Henderson in some time, I anxiously waited for the moment, I would be able to visit this location.    When the \"cheat day\" planets eventually aligned, I just happened to be to hungry and in the area.  The recommendation was thrown down and accepted. Happy, happy, joy, joy!  Again, having been used to the \"standing room only\" location of the other place of business, I was overjoyed at the ample room to order and enjoy my meal.  No frills....It's all about the chow.  If you are blessed to have a fellow dining partner that appreciates good burgers, the plain jane atmo will enable you to focus on talk and food.  I ordered up a double cheese \"Boyger\" w/ bacon and a side of glorious \"Chencho\" fries.  When ordered items were received and bitten, I was both happy and sad, I did not live in this neck of the woods anymore.  Happy because I would indeed be a \"Fat Boy\" and sad because I can't get this kind of quality and happiness on my side of town.  Bet.  If everything aligns again.....I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch as I heard from a few friends that they make a good burger.  Ordered the regular cheese burger, everything on it, steak frys and drink (their combo).    I really liked the burger.  Fries were good, though I think I would get the skinny fryes net time (my preference to type of fries I like).  Staff was very friendly.  Was greeted the moment I stepped into the place.  My order was to go, took about 5 minutes.  Would recommend and I am going back at some point to try other items."}
{"text":"I need to give credit to where credit is due.  I feel since my first visit things got a little bit better.    My husband and I stopped in for a pizza and a sandwich.  The pizza had a thinner crust and was not greasy at all.  I was amazed I enjoyed their pizza more than some of the dedicated pizza shops around town.  The price point is surely reasonable.   The Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich was good.  It wasn't overly huge but they definitely didn't skimp on the meat and toppings. Again the price point for the sandwiches are very reasonable.    Customer service is surely at the top of their priorities.  They are attentive and make for a friendly environment.  Thank you Fat Boy!"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome Great food Good customer service i like the pizza and the Boygers. Kudos"}
{"text":"My boyfriend came to Vegas and found this place on Yelp. He got a personal-size pepperoni pizza and thought it was so good that he wanted to eat here every day.   Today, we ordered a Philly cheesesteak, the chencho steak fries, and a guacamole turkey burger. All of the food was really good. I go to school in Philly and thought this was the best cheesesteak I've tasted. The turkey burger was good as well; I could have gone without the guacamole.   The staff was really polite and professional. The presentation of the food was great. Definitely will come here again with my fam, especially with the great prices!"}
{"text":"Fat Boy rocks!  I'm so happy they chose Henderson for their second location!  This fast/casual restaurant is well rounded, serving up some tasty BOYgers (burgers), BOYrittos (burritos) and pizza! There's something for everyone here!   My first meal here was a combo.  Double Monster Cheese Boyger with bacon and steak fries, fried mushrooms and chocolate shake! Woo was that Boyger a beast! If you check out my pic, you'll see what I mean.  The beef patties are thick and a nice size, good quality meat and flavorful. The bun is slightly toasted as well.  Nice seasoned steak fries, and that chocolate shake, reminiscent of simple old fashion milkshakes.    So this past month I've tried their pizza, wings, Pastrami Boyger, Philly Cheeseteak, Carne Asada Boyritto, Chorizo & Egg Boyritto, chicken fingers, chicken wings, chencho fries. Thumbs up on everything Ive tried.  The pizza is made the way I like it! Not drowned in sauce. I usually have to request light on red sauce everywhere I go, but not here. The pizza dough was thin and crisp both times I ordered it.  The prices for everything they charge here are super affordable!! You can probably feed a family of four for about thirty bucks.  I saw on the kids menu there's grilled cheese sandwich for $1!! Whoa!  Low prices, but high on quality!  Food is made to order, fresh, and hot. The burgers are not frozen patties.   The dining area is simple and  made up of tables and cushy seats. The sign says maximum capacity 60 people. It's roomy and felt spacious enough with the windows visible to views of Black Mountain.   What makes this restaurant extra special is the service and the family that runs FatBoy Restaurant. Abel and his family are awesome! They already have gotten to know the neighborhood, greeting their customers by name when they walk in.   OH, and they know their customers by their orders too! The first time my son went there, he got his and Mr. B's order. My son said when the order was handed to the kitchen, Abel peered from behind and asked my son, is Mr. B your dad? ...ha ha...wow! Pretty impressive.  Location: for those coming out of the area, 215 Stephanie South, turn right on Horizon Ridge  Henderson locals, it's across from the post office. BAM ..that easy. The strip mall has plenty of parking and entrance and exits are easily accessible on Horizon Ridge.  Family friendly, affordable prices, and most of all tasty food will keep us coming back. Especially me. I still havent  covered half their menu. yet."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent. We had double \"boygers\" and pizza. Both was decent. Price is pretty OK too. Honestly though, I prefer Dominos pizza and In n out's hamburgers."}
{"text":"Wow... how did I miss this little gem of a burgers n more joint? Just had the Monster Boyger and it is hands down one of the best burgers I have had in a long time!! Skip the franchise joints and give this place a try. Great prices and great customer service. You won't be disappointed. My new Saturday, after golf, burger stop."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best burgers hands down!  I've gone to location twice now, and they've yet to disappoint me. Depending on which day you go, it can get pretty packed, but the food is definitely worth the wait.  Fatboy's has definitely won me over, now all they need to do is open up some more locations."}
{"text":"Good stuff!!  Loved the burger and will definitely be back when on that side of town.  I wanted to give the Chencho fries a whirl, but it would have been too much to eat and the Burger was at the top of my list.  The dining room area is small, but I found it to be clean and well kept.  The kitchen is quite open to the dining room and, at first glance, appeared very clean and organized too.  I will certainly return again."}
{"text":"They burgers were lit. It beats out all other fast food. It's fresh. I really did enjoy the burger. Fries were kinda thin. But all in all I left satisfied and full"}
{"text":"little hole in the wall spot, hard to find but worth it.  the pastrami chili cheese fries are all you need on a cheat day!  the hamburgers are WAY GOOD!!!  dont waste your time on the philly sandwiches... you will regret it, but trust me on the burgers!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out, and I wasn't disappointed. I got the protein burger which was wrapped in lettuce, and it was pretty good. My fiancé got the guacamole burger and really enjoyed it. The burgers had a off the bbq taste, which was nice. The chili cheese fries were delish & the wings were good too ( a couple were teeny little things, but they tasted good) Less than $20 for all that food. Serving sizes weren't huge, but enough for 2 definitely. It's a small \"hole in the wall\" type of place, but the food is good, and the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here. The burger was good and the pastrami was delicious. The Onion Rings were battered just right and had a nice crunch. I will definitely come back and when I do I will have to try the pastrami fries. I recommend this place to all you burger lovers."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get here are the breakfast burritos. No matter what you get, grab a side of the green sauce to amp things up! Despite my fondness for that verdant condiment, I'm not the hugest fan of their chencho fries, which got soggy fast and didn't have much flavor. The portion sizes here are huge and the prices are low, but it you are a regular, you'll definitely be a Fat Boy yourself. Check out the Chencho Quesadilla for something different.  TIP: Call before heading over, they no longer have hours posted outside and the business has been closed despite accepting Eat24 orders recently."}
{"text":"I usually am very satisfied with Fat Boy. Today I put in a big order. A large pizza. Asada burrito. 2 large chencho fries and 1 regular fries.   Today I was unhappy bc the chencho fries were practically normal fries. Hardly any sauce, cheese or chicken.  Upon leaving I ordered 2 sides of ranch which I was charged .50 each for even though I ordered fries (I feel like the condiment goes w my food). And esp now that I have lots of dry fries being that the chencho is not at all drenched in goodness...I def need ranch and shouldn't have had to pay extra for it.   Finally my Adams burrito had no onions or cilantro, which is on the menu description...and part of why I even ordered it in the first place. I was craving asada w onion and cilantro...it's just not the same flavor.    Very disappointed today"}
{"text":"Place was very good, great family cooking. Just wish they had cheddar cheese for my burger. And me and my family love to eat the hot wings and fat fries it's delicious."}
{"text":"Good, fresh food.  Burger was smaller than I expected but still tasty."}
{"text":"The food is so great and at a great price!  So many different burger options!  The people that work at Fatboy are also very warm and welcoming, they make you feel like a friend of theirs:)"}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate there for the second time yesterday and the burger was just as delicious as it was the first time. Everything was very fresh and tasty. My husband likes the Monster Boyger and I like the fact that they know how to wrap a protein style burger with lettuce so you can actually eat it. Fries were hot and fresh! They were very busy at noontime but we got served without a real long wait.   As far as cleanliness, some tables were not cleaned but that was to be expected because of how busy they were. The bathrooms were very clean and had plenty of soap and towels.   They have salads and pizza but haven't tried them yet but if you want a good ole fashioned burger, give Fat Boy a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have tasted in a while. I have a new burger spot and will be trying the other food options. I will drive here to grab a burger instead of In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Better than Bobby flay and Bacchi burger at a fraction of the price.  Don't understand the bad reviews when comparing this place to chains and gourmet places.  Family owned and delicious."}
{"text":"This place was absolute fire! One of my new favorite burger spots since moving to henderson. And I must say advertising does work because the only way me and the wifey found this place was because of an ad. Anyway let's get into the meal...I ordered a turkey burger with cheese bacon and lettuce...Coupled that bad boy with some chili cheese fries for the W. The turkey burger was well seasoned and moist probably a little better than fatburgers...fries were perfect also well seasoned and they didn't have that pool of grease on the chili which makes them 42% less fat. Great meal and a good price me and the wife are for under $20. Check this place out #FatManApproved"}
{"text":"Pretty good local burger place. Couldn't complain about the burgers, the fries weren't my favorite, shake was good though."}
{"text":"Back again! I found this place through yelp last week and i had to come back! The food was fresh and delicious.   The customer service was outstanding! It is a great to see young people take their job seriously. After a yr and a half here i found my favorite burger place."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. The staff is very nice and the restaurant is clean. I had the Pastrami Boyger and it was ok. The pattie was fresh, but they should look at their pastrami (bland)."}
{"text":"I had the regular chili cheese fries they were less than ok didn't finish them the chili had green chilies in it tomatoes and beans and onions and they said there were no onions on their chili cheese fries or in it"}
{"text":"The service was great,also the food especially for the price. It is worth it.  I will definitely stop by again!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in based on reviews. We each had a double bacon cheeseburger, which were both excellent. Every condiment on the burger added to the experience. Absolutely scrumptious! I loved the skinny fries! The place is clean and the young man running the register was a top notch fellow. While we were there a guy, must have been a regular, hollered in the door his order and left. Came back a few minutes later and picked it up. Don't hesitate to pop in for some great burgers!"}
{"text":"We were visiting in Henderson and found thus place on yelp. When we called and asked if they delivered, the person was really nice and explained the delivery options.  We ordered chili fries, protein boyger and a philly cheese steak sandwhich. The food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Had the double monster boyger.  Food is cooked fresh so it takes a little longer than your average burger joint but definitely worth the wait.  Food is high quality and prices are fair.  It is a must try family owned business.  They have a large selection of food not just burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Worst service evaaar! The new young girl on the register is a nightmare, . The food is bomb, but, again it's really going downhill #fatboyswhy!?"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp and fellow Yelpers! My partner and I originally went to eat somewhere else, but didn't feel like waiting in a long line. She was in the mood for a turkey burger, so I opened my trusty Yelp app, searched nearby places and voilà...Fat Boy! I, too, am kicking myself for not knowing this culinary gem existed sooner.  She got the turkey boyger and a Caesar salad, I got the monster boyger combo and upgraded it to the chencho fries. Hers was well seasoned (she deemed it very yummy) and the salad was simple, not too strong and swimming in dressing like some Caesar salads tend to be. My monster burger was also seasoned well, tasted homemade, and all the toppings were perfectly balanced with the size of the patty and bun.  Those fries...oh how dangerous they could be...were scrumptious! I am a fan of green chilies/salsa, so if you are too, you will love them even more. I opted for the fat fries (steak) instead of the skinny fries, because I am a steak fry fan. They were too hot to eat as soon as they hit the table, so I let them cool down while I munched on my burger. During this time though, they absorbed the juices from the green sauce, so when I did get to dig into them, they were full of the green chili flavor - YUM! They weren't over cheesy, which cheese lovers might view as a bad thing, but I think it was a plus because you get a balanced forkful of goodness in every bite.  The burgers were so good that as soon as we swallowed our last bite, we wanted another one. So, being the gluttons that we are, we ordered another turkey boyger and a pastrami boyger ToGo, looking down on our phone like we were reading a request for food by hungry people at home...as if!  Thank you again, Yelpers. You've made two fat girls happy in our quest for burger satisfaction."}
{"text":"Really glad I found this place. It's not fancy, but it hits the spot. The burgers are awesome. Prices are cheap and the food you get is good value. It is not just their burgers that are good, bu their Mexican food which I've tried so far has been great. Probably some of the best carne asada fries I've had in Vegas. Onion rings are great too!  Also wanted to add that lots of little things that many places skip over or skimp on, they happen to do well here. It may seem weird but I've found that things like, the quality of a establishment's ranch sauce is a good determination of overall quality. A place that is cutting corners or has management problems is not equipped to have good ranch.  Their ranch gets a 9/10 from me, a very good omen.   The only thing knocking it from getting five stars is the quality is not consistent across the menu. The chicken nuggets are literally generic frozen nuggets you can get at the store. The chicken wings have almost no meat on them, and the pizza.....well, honestly it kind of sucks. I guess if the owners are reading this, please improve the sauce on the pizza, the crust and cheese is fine, but that you really gotta up your pizza sauce game.  The thing is though, the burgers and mexican food is so good it overrides those shortcomings. I'll just make sure to stick with the burgers and Mexican food in the future."}
{"text":"This menu is huge and cheap!  I went in and wanted to try everything just because there was so much and each thing was relatively cheap!  I settled on three things though, the philly cheesesteak (pretty good but a little dry and not huge), the French fries with hot sauce and cheese on them (not my favorite as the fries got soggy), and hot wings (probably my favorite thing I got but they didn't seem to have sauce on them.  Still tasty though!).  I would go back here to try a lot more of their items just because it is so accessible and cheap and not bad honestly."}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich I have had in a very long time. We are in Las Vegas with our family for a military softball tournament. We stopped in here for lunch and the food was delicious.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, 3 pastrami sandwiches, 2 giant hamburgers, great french fries. We will definitely be back!! And our boys are winning!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food!!! Call it in ahead for pick up if you're short on time. Love, love them seasoned fat fries! Cooked fresh!!"}
{"text":"Fun fact: some food poisoning is spreed person to person, including nirovirus that has all the symtoks I experienced and can be spread through eating food made in unsanitary conditions, look it up. Well I gave it to my mom and my husband, so thank you FatBoy. Whatever employee who made whatever decision that day made 3 people terribly sick. I don't know if this was a one time thing, like a lazy bad decision or of it was caused by unsanitary conditions and practices that are recurring, but I won't be finding out. I'm very sad about it too, I really liked your food and when I saw you on grub hub I was really excited. This was fat from my first time eating here, but it will certainly be my last. So disappointed and I feel so bad for my mom and my husband."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Every time I go I try something new & every time I'm blown away. Super great prices, super friendly and very clean. Do yourself a favor & try this place!!!"}
{"text":"We are here for the first time this morning and the food and service was great! Tried the breakfast ham and egg sandwich ($1.47!), Cheeseboyger with onion rings and fried zucchini. Everything was hot and tasty! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Bomb Philly cheese steak for sure.  I love the vibe to.  The food was nice and hot and the mozzarella sticks were nice and melt.   Need to try the chencho fries next time.  Hehe."}
{"text":"Fat Boy may not look like much on the outside but the boygers, are amazing! If you're looking for a good burger, this is a great gem!   I got a regular cheese boyger with fries. I inhaled the burger. The pickles and relish with the mustard really did it for me.the meat was well cooked and the fries were nice and fresh and hot.   The service is excellent !! The waitress was so kind and friendly. She even brought our food out to the car! Wow thanks so much !"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today and it was really good. Food was made to order and tasted good. The lady at the register was really nice and helpful since this was me and hubbies first time here. We got two turkey burger combos (mine was protein style) and hubby got chili cheese fries. The best part was we spent less than $20. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS DELICIOUS! I was feeling iffy at first because it was a burger joint. I'm not really a burger person but I would kill for a burger at In N Out. But anyways, this is about Fat Boy and BOY! They changed my perspective on their burgers. I ordered the avocado burger and it was so good! I forgot what my bf ordered but he was pretty satisfied with his meal. We came in and got greeted by the chef right away. He then took our order in line while we were still waiting for the cashier to finish the order before us. Which I really liked because I don't like to wait long for my food. He was very engaging with his customers and the staff were very friendly which is a plus. Will be coming back when we visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"After reading a Yelp review I thought I'd stop by for a burger.  Not far from where I live.  I'm a senior and eat out fairly often.  I didn't expect to be impressed, but WOW.  A joy to have an inexpensive lunch (Hit the tip jar) by a family owned establishment.  Adjectives?  Prideful, quality, friendly service from a family owned eatery!  Going back today with two friends!"}
{"text":"We was hungry and in an area not familiar with when it came to food. I whipped out the yelp app, saw the high ratings, so added Fat Boy to my bookmarks.  I have to give them a call before heading out, closing at 7 pm on a Saturday night seemed weird, and it was almost 9 luckily they were open till 10.  I kinda knew we was going to enjoy the food just from the many pictures of happy customers all over the walls. I ordered Guacamole Boyger and sis ordered the Guacamole Boyger meal with fat fries. While waiting I keep reading Fat Boy yelp reviews and one thing that came up a few times was the Chencho fries (fat/skinny) and of course I couldn't have left without ordering some. The Guacamole Boygers tasted really good and I especially loved the beef patty, I'm pretty sure it had jalapeno peppers or some think spicy in them.  The Chencho fries with cheese and all the additional ingredients were skinny fries which was good but because my sis had ordered fat fries I just stole some and made my Chencho fries great.  You should really order the Chencho fries fat, it takes another 5 mins or so but better than skinny.   I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews, maybe the location is out of the way for someone like me, but it is definitely a place to try.  I noticed they also make Boyrritos, pizzas, and wings, deliver and also have a facebook. And sell some Fat Boy merchandise."}
{"text":"This is a great place for families. We tried a variety of things from burgers to pizza to cheesesteak. We loved all of it. We are from Southern California and can't wait to come back. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love Fat Boy.....I love that it's a Mom and Pop, I love that their meat tastes fresh and not frozen, I love that the bread gets all the same loving that everything else does. I don't love that they're so far away from me or that they have such a small indoor seating area. Whenever I'm in the near vicinity I stop by here. I've had their double cheeseburger and their Chencho fries. Both are addictingly delicious and fresh. I always want to try something new but my nature keeps me going back to my usual order."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! Love the service too Close to home and big variety on the menu. Would recommend going there"}
{"text":"Chicken Caesar salad had an excellent flavor and the croutons were crunchy and tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious. I googled places that were affordable get yummy and it was delicious. Great staff. Great food. Huge portions."}
{"text":"Wednesday 1pm Lunch crowd, Full House every seat taken. 30 min wait which is understandable for large order (30+ wings Fries, 2L soda + Hawaiian Boyger). Food is indeed excellent.   Wings are small enough that they aren't sweated but slightly crisp, yet meaty.   Fat Fries are what you would expect. Similar to Fatburger or Red Robin.   Hawaiian Boyger, basically a really good burger with pineapple and BBQ sauce. Hit the spot though!  Would have given you 5 stars but I think you all need one more hand in the kitchen to expedite orders at peak times. GOOD HUSTLE Francisco M., the cashier multitasking register and cooking.   I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers, breakfast sandwiches, and even better prices. It has been added as one of my goto food choices."}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is good, fast & the food is amazing! Its not hard to find although you probably won't be on the East side of Las Vegas... unless you live on this side of town, of course.   I ordered the regular cheese \"boyger\" (get it? lol) and the chenco fries! The boyger was so juicy and a really good size portion for me. The chencho fries is one of their popular plates. You can either order skinny or thick cut fries. I ordered the skinny fries and on top has cheese and all their different types of sauces!  My boyfriend ordered the wet burrito.. and WOW, it was HUGE! It had their special sauces on top as well.. i don't know what it is, but it is soo good!   Definitely worth the try if you are at the East side of town in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab some pizza and burgers to go... the food was good... I enjoyed it and the prices are very affordable..."}
{"text":"I just got done eating a boyger cheeseburger combo and it just made my day. I live close by and I saw the name and had to pull right in and grab a menu.  The picture of the burger reminded me of a barbecue burger picnic style, homemade taste, on a hot summer day. It was that exactly. Actually now I wish I ordered the double. The meat was good the Buns were good. Fresh tasting veggies.I was hesitant about the Chipotle mayo but I asked with everything because I wanted authentic fat boy taste. I'm a fat boy myself and maybe I was just really hungry and couldn't bother with details like sauce as i scarfed it down in 5.5 seconds, but the mayo was subtle if anything it tasted like regular mayo.  The fries skinny or fat, I like skinny and they were good especially because they cover it in a seasoning. Good stuff.  They play Ranchero music here and I don't like the music but I was in such a good mood eating the food because it was so damn good I  found my head bobbing to the accordian beat. I'm a creature of habit so imma stick with the burger for a while and 1 day when I feel like getting crazy I'll try their chicken, wet burrito. It's a risk to order off the beaten path but it's worth to try.If it's bad I'll know never to attempt anything but the boyger because it could be lousey and bum my mood, but if it's good then we're grand slam, alternating dishes home run going to have a glorious day. Wings, pizza, a Philly cheese that they say is a favorite but I can't speak on anything but th boyger burger and fries and it was definitely worth it and definitely delicious! ! I'll be back for sure.         FYI I come here at least once a week now for there 1.39 egg and bacon sandwich  on a toasted bun, that price is before 12 and they are strict about that.   It goes up to 3.30 afterward.  I tried the pizza and it's ok. Just ok.  They play oldies not ranchero music now. The owners young sons and other staff are friendly. I still think they have the best burgers in town and I frequent this place all the time."}
{"text":"Been going to the Stewart location for years now.    So happy they opened one in Henderson.  The burgers are great.  Fresh ingredients and made fresh every time.  What more can you ask for?    Want a burger and not from a fast food drive thru then check this place out."}
{"text":"I have tried many burgers from locations such as In-N-Out, shake shack, five guys,  steak an shake etc.. I have now tried the double monster burger from Fat Boys and I have to say it resembles fat burger but It has a slight twist to it that makes it better. I would rank this burger in my top 3 best burgers I've ever had. I recommend this to anyone! Gotta try it for yourself an also friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a few of my co-workers.  Small space with 5 (2-top) tables.  We put together two of the tables so all 5 of us could sit together, luckily the others who were dining in were leaving so we could do this.  Four of us had the cheeseburger combo while one had the wings.  Everyone liked their food.  The burgers were simple but tasty.  The fries are steak cut fries that were seasoned well.  There was enough fries, but I wish it came with more.  There is something for everyone on the menu as they had burgers, pizza, burritos and everything in between.    Note: They are opening a location in Henderson on Horizon Ridge/Stephanie!  Hopefully it will be a bigger location as that location is just around the corner fro where I live."}
{"text":"These burgers are...Hear me people....TO DIE FOR. Oh my GOD these burgers are soooooooo good! I posted pictures upon my first visit a few months ago feel free to take a look. Upon this visit I was killing myself eating the husband looks at me and says...Baby did you get your pictures for yelp.com? LMAO I had a mouth full of burger so I just shook my head ...NO.  Now yall know its good when you forget to take pictures....LOL  The staff are extra kind the building is extra clean and the food is well how shall I say  OH my its pure pleasure to your toung and gums and yo belly when you eat this burger. The fries are steak fries! OMG I think I may go get one or two at this very moment Ive made myself quite hungry :) These burgers are so good you will STAB somebody!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! And very cheap! We always go in for the pizza special, wings and fat fries. Yum! We are regulars so as soon as we walk in they ask us if we want the usual! Lol"}
{"text":"Overall this is a great little spot and I love that they have family burger specials but my favorite thing to order are the pastrami fries!!!"}
{"text":"Trying out a new burger place (for me) on my side of town. Fatboy on horizon Ridge. Went with the Pastrami boyger today and it was awesome! Also got the combo and ranch is extra, but I love that they make it fresh daily. Fat fries were ok, but I would definitely try the Pastrami chili cheese fries one day when I want to pig out. The staff was also really friendly!"}
{"text":"I saw a review for this place on Nextdoor and decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did. The man who took our order was so nice. I ordered the chicken philly and fries and it was delicious. Food is made to order and not heavy or greasy. My husband ordered a carne asada  burrito and loved it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After eating at several other Burger joints with disappointing results, I was surprised to find that my quest for a good burger would end up at a location that was off the strip, and away from the big fancy malls.  In fact it was in an older neighborhood, that some may consider beneath them. But the truth is that it is on the corner of two main streets, it is a very clean center, with no sign of people loitering. Me and my girl felt very safe, and I had no problems leaving my convertible Mercedes in the lot. Now to the good stuff! The food! Their is a lot of items on their menu, and the seating area is pretty small. However the food is great, our burgers were cooked to perfection, and the flavor was excellent. Even the fries which I don't ordinarily eat were seasoned and cooked to a golden hue. Delicious! The service was better, and the price was shocking low.   I always check the kitchen out from cleanliness, and it was near spotless. The employees were constantly cleaning when they were not cooking or taking orders. This is always a good sign for me!  After my free refill of their delicious Horchata drink, and leaving nice tip, we walked out fat and happy.  Thanks Fat Boy! Our taste buds are grateful to have found you!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I heard good reviews so I had to try it out. I got a regular cheeseburger and the chencho fries. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The chencho fries were pretty good as well, however, I felt like something was missing. BUT it was still very good. Employees are super nice and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place definitely hits the spot. I have tried all of their different types of food and I am addicted"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  Fun place to meet friends and hang out.  Plenty of choices on the menu to choose from.  Everything cooked fresh."}
{"text":"This place is great. Affordable and will fill your belly. My 5yo son devoured a whole boyger and he is picky about most food. I love the charbroiled flavor of the burgers. Also the fact they give you a selection for the side with a combo. I had the onion rings, there is also fried zucchini and different types of fries. We will return"}
{"text":"Best Burgers in the eastside  Friend And I stop by and had  2 Double Bacon Cheese Boygers. Fast Service"}
{"text":"My little brother and I decided we were hungry, so I quickly yelped what was near me, and Fat Boy was one of the first to show on my nearby list.  I quickly read a couple of reviews and found that all were 5-stars. My curiosity sky-rocketed, I looked up the menu online, and we called in to order. (They were going to close in 20 minutes, but were still undoubtedly happy to take & make my order. THUMBS UP!)  WHEN: They are open & available from 10am-9pm. Dine in, take-out, delivery!  WHAT WE HAD: -Guacamole Boyger: This was my pic, and yayyy!! I did it!! This burger was satisfactory indeed!!! If you are a fan of avocado, this should be your pick! -Hawaiian Boyger: This was my brother's choice and of course I had to snag a bite!! This burger was like CRACK! I seriously wish I chose this burger as my first pick! It had the perfect amount of pineapple, plus that bbq sauce! Gotta love that bbq sauce on a burger! -Chencho fries: Now this is a must try!!! You can choose either fat or skinny fries! It is drenched in that delicious green sauce and covered in melted mozzarella! NUM NUM NUM  WHY: You will not be disappointed!!  *NOTE: I was chatting it up with the dude that worked there, and I was explaining what yelp was to him. He said he gets a lot of yelpers!! Muahaha, YELPERS SPREAD LOVE!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in a strip mall in Henderson. Classic burgers and shakes, burritos, pizzas, wings and salads. FAT or skinny fries. Affordable pizza/wings specials. Oldies playing over the speaker. Gal behind the counter was friendly and the service was fast for the 6 of us who dined. One of the kids with us accidentally ordered an Oreo shake but wanted strawberry and they had no problem exchanging the shake for the correct flavor. Burgers were cooked perfectly and the buns and fries were tasty. The monster burgers were indeed monster. Grilled ham and cheese was tasty too. We plan on coming back for the nachos, pizza and wings."}
{"text":"had a serious hankering after reading reviews on yelp for this place and went in for the verde fries and burger. the fries were swimming in a half inch of water from the sauce and were limp soggy mess after i got home with them. hey fat boy..drain your sauce, no one wants to eat that. burger was also ran and can be topped by five guys, fatburger, in and out easily."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a different restaurant in our area.  Hubby ordered a HUGE burger, I had a personal pizza and daughter chicken fingers.    The beef patties on the burger are amazing, great flavor and perfectly cooked.   Their pizza sauce had amazing flavor, a bit too greasy for my liking, but that ok.   Overall, very happy with our experience.   We a Ordered it take out, and was done within 15 minutes.  Hubby was the one to pick it up, so I couldn't tell you his experience during pick up.   Will order again soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best little restaurant I've ever been to! And they serve everything! I was very surprised! I'm very happy and very full. I'd recommend this place to anybody great food great prices great people!"}
{"text":"Love this place , I would always go to the other location when I was in the neighborhood... So glad they are in Henderson also their food is awesome and service is great...."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! i have no idea why I've never been here before! to start off the guy at the register was super cool and laid back, great customer service. once we gave out order we got our food fast. it was absolutely delicious!   I went with my friends and two kids, we had the 4 'boyger\" and fries special and a '14 inch pizza, fat chencho fries and hot chicken wings, and didn't wait as long as we thought. Two of the four boygers were the Hawaiian style, omg simply delicious! the originals were also veeery good, home made style! The pizza was also amazing! not too greasy and good ratio of cheese and sauce! The chencho fries, no words on how amazing they were, never thought salsa verde, cheese, and chicken would be sooo good!  We will definitely be come back!"}
{"text":"This was our second time ordering Fat Boy's and we are so impressed! So far we have tried their burgers, very juicy; their carne asada quesadilla (my personal favorite), and their chicken fingers. The combos come with your choice of thick steak fries, or thin fries (both are yummy but I prefer the thin fries) I would recommend this place to anyone! The staff are all so nice and welcoming. They offer take out or dine in, they have roughly 8 tables, fountain drinks and bottled drinks, and great prices!!!We will definitely continue to order from here. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic charbroiled burgers. Love their fried zucchini and pastrami sandwiches. You have to try this place !! Very friendly staff!! Can't wait to come back and try something new!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were craving the pastrami chili cheese fries & burger so we decided to go today. We arrived around 4:50pm ordered one large  pastrami chili cheese skinny fries & two pastrami burgers. They called our order 17 mins later that our food is ready to go soon as the lady sees me reach for the bag she says she put fat fries instead of skinny like we asked, I told her no give us what we asked so then again we wait more for our order. Finally we get our order we got to the car I check the bag & I see they gave me a small pastrami fries. This is ridiculous simple order & get it wrong twice! I go back inside tell the cashier named Estevan what was wrong he said he's sorry he only charged me for small size. So I said just give me another small then & charged me for it. Really? At this point they should of just gave it to me for free or give me a large size for the price of small. But since they didn't this is why I'm writing a ONE STAR REVIEW.  I waited almost 30 mins THEY GOT MY ORDER WRONG TWICE. By the time I got home my burgers were cold! The food is very good but the service is poor. BEWARE!!! Always check your order before you leave! Because most likely they will get your order wrong! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!"}
{"text":"I took my grandma here so we could grab some food to go I had found this place on yelp and saw all the great reviews so decided why not give this place a try   There's not to much to try on the east side it seems   We got a package with four bogyer and fries and a soda :)  my grandma couldn't have the chipotle mayo which they nicely put regular mayo on for her :) we got the fat fries which were super yummy we all really enjoyed  Everyone loved it and no one complained!!! We will be back to try some other items it's a nice change and it's worth coming and checking it   When we were leaving cops we're coming in to eat so they like it lol"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't expect much of this place from where it was located but honestly I don't like burgers all that much and my boyfriend wanted to try it and I have to say the people that worked there were so friendly and it felt like a ol' mom and pop joint. The food was great I got the buffalo chicken burger and it actually was spicy unlike any other \"buffalo\" flavored hamburger I seem to get! So don't let the appearance fool you this place is a gem. Been craving it all week!"}
{"text":"Their food is awesome but I stopped eating here after I found a long black hair baked into my pizza. I took a picture of it, showed it to the manager my last visit there, and he apologized by giving me a 3$ off coupon. I will never eat here again. Fatburger is a lot cleaner."}
{"text":"Wow what a great burger. Really excellent burger and before I was even done with the first one I ordered a second one lol. I ordered the double cheese boyger with fat fries and onion rings. My wife got the carne asada burrito which was just ok. The red salsa however was great. Honestly this blows away most every other fast food burger out there. At first I thought it was gonna be like a fatburger but was waaaayyy better. They need a drive thru!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite burger place. Holds up against the best of them but the prices are fair. Monster burger are huge but cooked to perfection and their pastrami burger is just the right amount of juicy."}
{"text":"Dont you just love the bookmark feature?  It's lunch time so I check my bookmarks and what do you know? Fat Boy is right down the street. So off I go!  As I come in I hear Mexican music playing in the background. While looking at the menu on the wall, the lady behind the counter greets me in Spanish. I dont blame her cuz I kind of look like im Mexican. For a second there I almost ordered Al Pastor tacos. LOL.  So I ask the nice lady what was good since it was my first time. She said to go with the combo of the single Boyger, Chencho Fries and Small Drink. CHEN WHAT? She smiles at me and says, \"Chencho Fries: Your choice of fat or skinny fries topped with cheese, chicken bits, and a green sauce.\" Ok! Combo it is!  I take a bite of the Boyger. I had to do a double take. Am I at Fatburger or Fat Boy? It tastes just like theirs but I paid 6 bucks and some change instead of 10 bucks or more. Now that I can get with.   As for their Chencho fries, its basically an enchilada but with potato sticks instead. What I found out was that you should eat it right away because it tends to get soggy over time and it doesnt matter if you get it with fat or skinny fries. So if you are into green sauce, this will sure hit the spot!  Besides burgers, these guys have wings, chicken fingers and pizza. Not to mention sandwiches, boyrritos, and combination plates. Their pizzas must be good because when I was eating my food, this lady comes in and picks up 5 pizzas to go.   The minus 1 star is for their location. They are situated in one of many suites of one big building. The part of town they are in is kind of suspect. I can only assume what characters may come out at night.   Some random info: They take cards and from what I noticed, there is no minimum. They have a decent soda fountain so you should be able to get your refills' worth. They got I would say about 6 small tables so if its packed, dont let it discourage you. You can always take it to go. There is a bathroom but you have to ask and then walk through the kitchen towards the back. Kind of awkward if you ask me but if you gotta go, you gotta go!  So whenever I have a Fatburger craving, im yelling out \"Fat Boy!\" because nobody  wants to eat at \"Skinny Boy\"."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot. A bit of a hike from my area but I was in the neighborhood and decided to pick up some food. Definitely not disappointed.  Let's be honest, not much to look at. Very clean and very inviting but it's all about the food here. Plenty of space to sit down and eat but I noticed a lot of people watering and taking out. I went ahead and placed my order through Yelp before I arrived.  I want to head and started off with the guacamole burger. Just the single no cheese. Patty was seasoned perfectly. My only complaint is they use that generic \"guacamole\"paste that you find at the low-end Mexican restaurants. The kind that has that high gloss to it, a shine to it. Other than that the burger was delicious. Love the size of the bun and it complements the burner perfectly. Decided to give this a 3/5 only because of the avocado paste.  Went to head and got an order of the fried mushrooms. Fried golden brown in a perfectly seasoned pattern. Mushrooms are still fresh and juicy when you took a bite. There's about 10 or so medium size the small size mushrooms in my order. Gave these a firm 5/5.  Next, the grown child in me decided to get a grilled cheese. Nothing over-the-top with this girl cheese. For two dollars and some change it was pretty decent. My only gripe was the size. I'm sure in the kids meal you get the same thing for half the price for about a dollar. Finished in about two bites. Still cheesy and grilled perfectly. 3/5 just for the size.  Finally I had an order of the chicken wings. Decided to get them dry with the sauce on the side since I had to drive home. Decent size wings. And the hot sauce was pretty good. Standard Frank's red hot I believe or something along the lines. The wings themselves were a little bit on the \"crispy\" side. Gave these a 4/5. I think it was a dozen for 8.99 so average price.  Overall I loved what I got. Definitely wouldn't mind sitting down and enjoying it all a little bit more fresh the next time on there. Might go ahead and do a double cheeseburger and skip the avocado paste next time and maybe go ahead and have them do the sauce on the wings. People behind the counter or very courteous, helpful, and always seemed to be smiling."}
{"text":"Friendly service, filling carne asada fries, cheap, and the burgers (pastrami burger and Hawaiian burger) were gristly, but not bad. It looks to me like the burgers or Mexican are a better bet than the pizza. Neighborhood is gritty, but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!! I had a philly cheese steak sandwich and my boyfriend got the double Boyer burger. Fried mushrooms and fat fries as sides!  Super nice people that work here too!!! What a great find!!! We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Fat Boy is my favorite place to get a burger on this side of town. Every visit I've ever made here has been met with great customer service. It's not made until you order it and everything here is made fresh, that's another thing I really appreciate. If it's your first time here, I'd definitely recommend the pastrami boyger or a Hawaiian boyger paired with their signature chencho fries. The pastrami burger is a burger topped with pastrami and it's always oozing with a white cheese. The Hawaiian includes all the typical burger ingredients with pineapple and barbecue sauce, it's exploding with a medley of flavors. The chencho fries can be ordered with fat or skinny cut fries and they're topped with cheese, green pepper, and little pieces of chicken; they're amazing but you have to eat them before they get soggy. The Philly cheesesteaks, pastrami sandwiches, and chicken fingers are also delicious. I've never ordered anything here that didn't make me proud."}
{"text":"Holy smoke, the owners actually remembered my name on my second visit!  This blows me away, because usually they take down your name when you first order, and it was 4 split between visit; also didn't tell them my name on my second visit, and young lady had my name down without asking for it.....this personalize the entire experiences or maybe they read Yelp, and using our favorite website as a tool to listen to their customers, and improve on the business.   In any case, I'm adding a star for this visit because Fat Boy earned it on this particular stop; also, I notice the Yelp sticker on their front door.  Well, the place was almost full at 115 pm, but there was one open table, and I grabbed it.    I ended up ordering the pastrami boyger special, and it was done right.  It's an understatement to say I'm  enjoying fat boy's cripsy burger edges, because it has me coming back, and the ratio of Pastrami and Burger was perfect........Damn it Jamie W, why you had to tell me about this place....it's pretty addictive!       Well, Fat Boy continue to kick some butt  and I'll see you very soon."}
{"text":"If you like burgers then fat boy is the place to go very good service and food always good"}
{"text":"Come check this place out really great food excellent and friendly service everything on the menu is great try one of there monster burgers bet you cant eat it all lol"}
{"text":"Yesterday we had lunch there.. we never been disappointed. The burger was absolute perfection the Onion Rings amazing.   If you want a great burger @ reasonable price in a clean environment  this is the place to go.  Oh...  when you get your order they bring out a bottle of cold ketchup!!"}
{"text":"Better than in and out prices are great. For an inexpensive hamburger that is really good this is the place. Very clean but it is busy."}
{"text":"Me and Fat Boy go back. We go waaaay back. I am pretty confident I was one of the first 1000, if not 500 customers ever at Fat Boy. I was born and raised on the East side, when a new food spot opens, I know about it. Plus they were/are big supporters of car clubs, and the local neighborhood in general. So yesterday while cruising around the old hood, it was one of 2 choices for me. Fat Boy won.  Right off top they remembered us, AND what we usually order. Please note its been anywhere from 8 months to a year since I have been here. My bf and I brought his friend with us who was a newbie. I told him the entire menu is good, but a solid choice will always be a burger. EXCUSE ME, a BOYGER. Many choices, Cheeseboyger, Pastrami boyger, Bacon boyger. All come standard with mayo, lettuce, pickle, tomato and onion I believe, but they will customize it how you want. (my 2 favs are the bacon or pastrami) They also had no problem switching out my fries to a side salad in the combo.  However, if you're a first timer, I say go for the chencho fries. I know some other yelpers weren't too impressed HOWEVER I think they are crazy and these fries are golden! You have the choice of fat or skinny. I always go with the fat, as they load them up with chile verde sauce, chicken, and melted white cheese which I believe to be jack but not 100% sure. They are better if you dine in, as they tend to get a little soggy in an unvented togo container. The pizza is decent. They make the dough from scratch. Pretty much everything is made that way here.  I personally haven't tried it, but a good friend said the beef mix plate is one of those things you eat and go home and take a nap after. The wings and fingers are also bomb, don't be a pu**y and go for the hot sauce. It is also made there and has this special tang to it.   I know the east side isn't known for its food spots. But don't let the area fool you. This mom and pop joint is a local business you won't regret supporting. They are finally out there and known, and I couldn't be happier for them!"}
{"text":"This is a great little café run by some very nice people. Everything that I've tried here has been good but my favorites so far are the burgers. They are cooked to order and even the well done ones are juicy. My favorite is the Hawaiian with fat fries. Don't take the paper off, you'll need it to catch all the drippings! So much better than the generic fast-food burger joints! Glad that someone updated the business info on Yelp, they are open till 10:00 on Saturdays so give them a try."}
{"text":"This place just opened up in the neighborhood really clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Food was really tasty. I got the Philly cheese steak combo and my friend got the Pastrami Boyger combo plus onion rings both highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just happened to drive by this hole in the wal place and tried it one day. The burgers were amazing! That was over a year ago, Ive been going bad atleast once a week since. The staff is super friendly and the food speaks for itself. Try the chencho fires!!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service.  DELICIOUS burgers.  Yummy ranch.  Worth the drive from downtown for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the Pastrami burger and fat fries. Excellent build, taste, and seasonings. A true burger gem. Friendly service and value. Looking forward to returning. This is a must visit place if you are a burger fanatic."}
{"text":"We ate here after printing out a special on Groupon. My hubster had 2 cheese boygers, my son had a quesadilla and I had a cheese boyger too plus we ordered the chencho fries. It was the best cheeseburger I've eaten in a long while and didn't leave us burping up a nasty after taste like In n Out. The burgers here remind me of the burger drive-inns in Cali. The chencho fries were too salty for my taste but overall I can see why everyone thinks they are delicious. It was about a 30 minute drive for us and it's a good thing we don't live close otherwise we would be here all the time which could be a bad thing as I saw they had pastrami sandwiches on the menu and I bet they are fantabulous. Next time we go back, I will have to try it."}
{"text":"This place is so glad. My brother had mentioned Fat Boy and it was his birthday, I treated the family to lunch. I ordered the Guacamole boyger, it was delicious. My brother got the Pastrami boyger , and it looked so good. I will be ordering that the next time I go.  The staff was so nice.  I will definitely be recommending this place."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and haven't been disappointed in anything yet. Very much miss this sort of place after moving from LA. Little \"mom and pop\" burger shacks and taco stands used are everywhere in LA but out here all there seems to be are overpriced tourist traps and low quality fast food chains. NOT FAT BOY though. Great friendly staff and the food is prepared with care.  Best pizza in town. Lots of toppings and they are good. Not stingy with anything they even give a bunch of pepper and Parmesan packets. great warmed up the day after too.  Best hamburger in town for under $10, better tasting than a few I've had here for $15. Love the fries. So glad this place is close I love it."}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened one on this side of town. Every thing is freshly made. To day I got the cheese steak sandwich. So good! Can't wait to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Service is incredible, everyone is always so nice. The food is quite tasty and the prices are such a value. I'd recommend their chencho fries and the monster \"boyger\". Tip: they sell authentic Mexican cokes in tall glass bottles that taste completely different than the American version. Real sugar and not high fructose corn syrup being the culprit, I believe."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Employees are friendly and hustle. Got the pastrami burger and fat fries."}
{"text":"I'm pretty Plain Jane when it comes to food so I only got a cheese boyger and fries but it was still soooo good! Trust all the other awesome reviews. They are what brought me in here and I'm happy about it. Too bad I'm from out of town so I don't get to come here obsessively because I would. There is such a large menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"Great burgers every time!!! Chencho fries are great, a must have!! Great service as well!! Always a great experience here."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place! Whenever we go the workers are always so nice and helpful and accommodating. They always have so much patience. I usually don't know what I want and they help me figure that out. But they are also always accurate and the food is always delicious and fresh. I have never had any issues. It is a hole in the wall kinda place so it doesn't have much seating but it's quaint and quiet. Just perfect for when your looking for a place to relax and get a great meal for a very affordable price."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor & EAT HERE! Little hole in the wall I found here on yelp... Prices are almost better then the food. Pastrami burger, Chacho fries, chicken cheese steak all under $5.... Worth the little drive from my casa."}
{"text":"I came in, service was absolutely wonderful. I ordered mushroom fries which I would not recommend they are absolutely disgusting but everything else about the place is freaking great!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and sandwiches. Chili cheese fries were really good. Always a friendly staff and great service. Good menu selection and always tastes great."}
{"text":"I welcome this family owned business to are neiborhood the burgers are awsome n fries are crisp n perfectly seasoned. Make sure to get a side of ranch 4 ur fries it homemade. Next time I'm gonna try the Philly cheese steak the pastrami sandwich looks good as well. The service is fast and friendly and I look forward to enjoying many more meals there. Give it a try so good."}
{"text":"I found myself at Fat Boy at the request of a great friend and co-worker who possesses a rather refined pallet.  This small, unassuming venue nestled in behind a busy illanteria, was the surprise of the year for me so far.   Don't be fooled by the lack of decor or the tight dining area that only fits 27 consenting adults. The extremely friendly and outgoing staff greet you and help you make your decision to wage war against the American Heart association. Reviewing the menu alone caused my overall cholesterol to jump up 27 points. I ordered the double cheese boyger with all the fixings. That means a fried egg and a generous serving of bacon perched on what is already a bohemith burger. Made to order and served with brevity. The instance the boyger hit my mouth I immediately forgot where I was. eating the double cheese boyger was like reading an amazing book you didn't want to end. Every bite was full of flavor you can only find in places where the cooks truly cook with love and lard.  The price was extremely inexpensive and came in under ten bucks. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. If I may offer some advice, don't wear a white dress shirt with a fine tie. It is worth the trip to this establishment for their rather diverse menu. ( they do burritos and pizzas as well). I will definately be back to this place they call fat boy. My mouth waters even as I write this. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great little spot.  I had the double cheese boyger and fries.  Both were really good.  Just as good if not better than Inn and Out, 5 Guys, and all the usual spots.  Best part is the staff.  Everyone is super friendly.  I cant wait to go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome comfort, homestyle cooking at this place! Staff very pleasant. Eaten boyger's, fries, boyrritos and each time I was happy, full and the bonus is I didn't have to pay an arm, leg and neck for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food and an amazing selection. I had wings, some of the best I have had in town. My wife had a cheesesteak and it was very good. The kids had a burrito and burger. My son said it was one of the best burgers he ever had. Fat boy is a family owned and run restaurant. The owner prepares the food with help of his sons and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"It's rare I give 5 stars but I can't think of anything negative about my experience. My husband is big on always wanting to eat cheeseburgers, his favorite is 5 guys mine is in n out. Fatboy burger is up there with both of these places. The burgers are homemade not frozen paper thin patties. I ordered 2 double cheese boygers with everything on it. It came with mayo lettuce tomato pickles if I'm not mistaken... I also ordered two orders of the fries fat style. The fries are loaded with a seasoning salt and everything tasted fresh and was hot. The service was great, they bring your food to you at your table. They had basketball going on the tv, it was a very relaxing environment and I didn't feel rushed out at all. It's not restaurant style but a step up from a \"fast food place\""}
{"text":"The loaded french fries are dangerously fabulous!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in to Fat Boy, you might not expect much. With less than a dozen seats and maybe 4 or 5 tables, the place seats only about a dozen people or so. There's nothing fancy in here, just a menu board on the wall, a little 19\" TV and a soda fountain. But this tiny restaurant on the East side of town, just off Lamb & Stewart has got something way more important than that...killer food at crazy good prices!   One of the other great things about Fat Boy is that it's also a family run business. On our last visit the owner was behind the counter taking orders and cooking, with his son running food out and busing tables. You can really tell they enjoy what they're doing and working together, and the love they put into their food shows. We've been here a couple times now and have gotten nothing but friendly, fast service.  The menu here has got a quite a few things on it. Some of the items are cleverly named with the restaurants theme, like the boygers and boyrittos. But that's just the beginning of a long list of things offered here, including salads, pizza, wings and fingers. I've been here a couple times now, each time having a burger and fries, but we've heard good things about other stuff on the menu. They even offer family meal style things like a 4 pack of burgers with fries and soda for a just tad over $20. It's hard to find this quality of food at the price. All the burgers are handmade and never frozen.   I usually go with a pastrami burger and get the larger monster patty. For about $6, this is easily one of the best burgers you're going to get in town, especially at the price point. I normally like to have my burgers done medium rare, but I don't believe different temperatures are offered. Even still, the meat is tender, juicy and seasoned well. The pastrami is sliced evenly and piled on high. A slight toast to the bun gives a nice little crunchy texture to the whole thing. I also like that they just top it lightly with a bit of mustard and onion so that you can taste both, but it doesn't overpower the flavor of the burger or pastrami. They also have pretty decent fries and it's a huge plus for me that they let you choose between skinny or fat fries. We've tried both the chencho fries and pastrami chili cheese fries, both were ok, we just weren't huge fans of either. I like the fat fries the best and they are good enough on their own if you ask me.  All in all, Fat Boy is a super solid 4 star option for a great burger, sorry...boyger. If I lived closer, I'd probably go here over most fast food burger joints in town. And with such a large menu, I'd imagine you could host an awesome football party or something similar without spending a lot of dough either. Even with as far as we live, I wouldn't hesitate to come back. The foods great, the service is great and the prices are great. You can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"Amazing new spot in Henderson. I've been to the Stewart location and was amazed by the food and price. So I was beyond happy when I found out this was on my side. This place offers a wide variety of food. Burgers, burritos, pizza, chicken fingers and wings. They offer the best customer service and are always welcoming and respectful. Come here and you'll never stop coming back."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay. Crust is chewy not crisp. Mimics some New York pizza that I've had. The pastrami burger was good. The wings were good also I got mild. $1.50 extra per pizza topping which in my opinion is absurd!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! The best steak fries! I've seen this place before but never had the chance to eat here. Then a few years later one day I realized I was close by and remembered it and finally decided to eat here. Lol really good food anyways glad I decided to stop in."}
{"text":"Ask me, \"Jason, if you can only eat a burger from one place for the rest of your life, where would it be from?\". My answer is, \"I will eat Fat Boy boygers from now on please.\" If you haven't had a burger from Fat Boy, and you think you've had \"the best burger in town\", you're wrong. You haven't had the best burger in town until you've had a Boyger from Fat Boy. It trumps em' all.   We've been coming here for years, and we never tire of it. For Fathers Day, this is where I want to go each year.   It's a hole-in-the-wall mom-n-pop shop and is family run. Able and Co. are ALWAYS pleasant and friendly, who does a great job in juggling business and family. It's nothing to be in there on a Saturday and see Able come in with the little ones in tow, having just come from soccer games. He remembers us by name.   The Boygers are amazing. Flat grilled, fresh, and juicy. Their veggies are always fresh. I love getting bacon on mine. If you don't like your bacon crispy, be sure to let em' know when you order. Otherwise crispy it will be (which is just they way I like it!!)  I have had the Pastrami sandwich, the Pastrami Boyger, their chicken fingers, their pizza, and their Hawiian Boyger. In all the years we've been coming here, I still haven't had the Philly Steak, but only because I lover the Boyger and the Pastrami so much, I have a hard time ordering anything else. Everything we've ever had here, is out of this world. It's the one place, literally, the one place, we can go as a family, and there is something that all of us can order and be exceptionally happy.   Like fries? Their fat fries are BOMBER!!! And they are always too hot to eat when they bring them out to you. I'm a fry snob, and I love these fries!!  Being from the East Side, we really try to support East Side businesses, espically those that are local owned. As long as Fat Boy is here, we will be there with them."}
{"text":"Don't need to say a lot. Check out my review for their East Side location. To basically sum it up, if I could have only one burger for the rest of my life, it would be a Fatboy Boyger. Able and Co. know how to cook amazing grub and they know how to take care of a customer. Family owned and run, you will not be disappointed if, nay, WHEN, you come here. The only thing you will be, is looking forward to the next time you eat here. My faves: the The Double Cheese Boyger, you can also get a triple, the Pastrami Sandwich, the Pastrami Boyger, the Monster add Pastrami, the wings, and their chicken tenders ain't bad either. Truth be told, I haven't had a bad meal at Fatboy. Ever."}
{"text":"All these other burger spots getting love and I realized I've never reviewed Fat Boy. Four juicy solid stars. The only reason to drive to this side of town is for this damn burger and fries. Chencho Fries that is.  Location: Shit location in a shit part of town. I don't care. I think I'm tough even though I am a short white girl who cries at Kodak commercials. Get real. Any neighborhood could be bad at any given time of day. This place is JUST FINE.   The burgers taste like a backyard burger straight off the grill done RIGHT. Perfectly seasoned and the patty is not smashed or too thick. Both my biggest complaints about a burger. They don't even call it a burger because it's so cool. They call it a Boyger. Yeah boyeee! It's really nothing fancy, but it's exactly and I mean exactly how I like my burger. Please don't come here if you are expecting fancy. This sure ain't no supper club.  The fries. I swear the Chencho fries deserve MAD love. Like Quentin Tarantino movie love. Uma could order them and be eating them and then BOOM a huge ass ninja fight! Or cowboy zombie fight! I don't care, but some fight with the fries and the green chile sauce and melted cheese flying through the air in slow motion. I wouldn't wait for Redbox for that shit. Do it proper if you order these. You have a choice: Thin or thick fries. I went with thin and asked for exra crispy to hold up with the toppings cuz that's how I roll. PROPER FUCKING FRIES, SON.  Okay, I'm done. Just make the drive because it's cheap, it's real and even though I only went once I have thought about going back 100 more times...."}
{"text":"Great fast food burger. This isn't fancy, gourmet wygu burgers. Fat Boy is fast food. two of us had bacon cheeseburgers with fried egg, fries and sodas. It was under $20. Burgers were excellent. Fries had seasoned salt, which I don't care for. Menu had burgers, pastrami, burritos, pizza, wings. The guys at the counter were friendly. I'll def. be going back."}
{"text":"Went back this morning because they make breakfast sandwiches  (they open at 9am). I had a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and it was excellent. So nice to get a hot, fresh and  delicious breakfast sandwich that's not microwaved!"}
{"text":"Good customer service, clean place. I loved the burger, it tasted like an In n Out burger. But wouldn't recommend the $6 fries everyone was raving about. The green sauce was watery and just made the fries completely soggy."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, it is a family owned restaurant and the fact they remember you even by voice over the phone means they are really great or I order here way too much lol but the food is so good. I recommend the Pastrami Boyger with cheese and fat fries. Its like bites of heaven! The staff is always friendly and as it is made fresh when you order it I suggest calling your order in. I have not been disappointed with anything i've ordered so far."}
{"text":"Great burgers and onion rings.  They make the burgers fresh and use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Great little establishment and great food. Best double cheese burger I had in a great while. I will definitely be back!  Fresh buns, fresh meat (not frozen) and fresh veggies! Well worth it and if your in a hurry call ahead for pick up."}
{"text":"Great people, AMAZING food!   My wife and I were both craving a \"real\" hamburger - nothing frilly. She found Fat Burger on Yelp, and the photos were exactly what we were looking for. Two Double Cheese Boygers, one order of skinny fries, one order of steak fries, a chocolate shake and a Diet Coke later, we're extremely satisfied. We would have taken photos, but the food didn't last long enough for us to get our phones out.  We can't wait to go back and sample the rest of the Fat Boy menu! Five stars - highly recommend."}
{"text":"After a five star experience with co-workers, I opted to take the family for a five star adventure of their own. After all the hype about how good my burger was the first time, my son chose a carne asada burrito. It was good, but if you are going to Fat Boy for the first time, I recommend a \"Boyger\". The burrito was more on the \"Americanized\" side, but good none the less. The ladies got burgers and were very impressed.   I kept my word and saved room for a milkshake this time. We got a chocolate and a vanilla and split them four ways. Definitely enough for four people. They were both outstanding. Even the milkshakes here are some of the best I've ever had.  We arrived around brunch time on a Sunday and there was absolutely no waiting. The service was as friendly and efficient as last time. A few customers came in to pick up their phone orders while we were dining. Phone orders would be a great idea during the week, especially if you are under the gun with limited time for lunch.  Two visits and two five-star ratings. I'm a big fan of Fat Boy."}
{"text":"Wow! What happened to Fat Boy? We used to love this place. Came in tonight (on a Sunday) and it took 25 min to get two burgers and a couple orders of fries. My skinny fries were completely cold (my friends fat fries were warm but, not mine). The bun had been left on the grill to toast so long it was like biting into brick. So very disappointed in the food. It was worth, maybe, one star but, I gave them two because even though the staff was incredibly slow, they were friendly. Sorry Fat Boy, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is so fresh and tasty. I also love the fact that its family owned!!! And the checho fries wow!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this EASTCYDE eatery every since my eyes gandered at its' Yelp review.  Add another diamond in the rough.   My usual is a double cheese boyger w/ fries and a 500 ml bottled Coke.  I changed it up with this past order. I opted for the Philly Cheese Steak.  Adding the Philly Cheese Steak to my favorites. The steak is grilled perfectly and has the right amount of makings for a solid-well-made cheese steak. I'm also a fan of their Buns which are delivered bakery fresh daily. Fat steak fries combos nicely with whatever you're stuffing your face with...EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!   Great service:  Today I ordered a fairly big order for pick-up. The homie did that order quick style! It took me less than 15 minutes to get there from work, and my order was ready to go. Great service yallz!  Solid food Fat Boy!!! I'm glad there is another great eatery coming out of the EASTCYDE. Will continue the support."}
{"text":"Across the street from the Post Office i use . I saw the selection of great items on Yelp along with glowing reviews and was very optimistic ordering a nice selection of their offerings .The owner was  very friendly whcih is why I gave this place the one star . CRAP - I got crap . I asked for a pastrami burger and received an inedible piece of crap . I got some fatty meat on a burger , so i threw out the fatty stuff and tried to eat the burger but it was nasty . I took home a beef burrito plate and it was horrible .  When it comes to food , there is great ,very good , okay , so-so and just awful .I don't believe I came there on the wrong day and was unlucky . This was 10am and only one other customer in the place . The thing is , if you're in the mood for burgers  , there are soooo many good place here to eat . Same goes for Mexican food , pizza and wings .  I apologize if i missed a hidden gem on the menu . I really don't understand the 5 star reviews of this place saying how good the pastrami burger is . For those people I say , please go to Weis deli and order a pastrami burger and compare the two and thank me later"}
{"text":"Just came across Fat Boy for the first time and loved it!! The Monster Boyger is huge and juicy. Highly recommend. The guacamole on the guac boyger was also fantastic! We got one guacamole boyger, one monster boyger with cheese, an order of fat fries, an order of skinny fries, and 2 drinks all for less than $20! ($19.28 to be exact) bot of us were starving and left plenty full. The restaurant itself is in a nice location, very easy to access. We came during the Saturday lunch rush so it was packed! But all staff members were still very friendly and accommodating. Even with how crazy busy she was the waitress still even stopped to talk with us about our baby when she brought out the food. We give Fat Boy 5/5 and will definitely be back many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"Omg. This place is munchies heaven. The boygers  are bomb. They have everything. Pizza burritos. Wings. Definitely recommend this to anyone that's lit and needs fuel."}
{"text":"Loved the cheese boyger and my husband enjoyed his pizza. Reminds me of old fashioned burgers. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. I wish people would try their small local businesses rather than going to McDonald's. Great customer service! Hope this business makes it.."}
{"text":"You'd better really be hungry for double cheese monster boyger it must have a pound of meat and is char-broiled. I had to box up the steak fries for lunch tomorrow. The place was empty on a Monday night. Huge menu."}
{"text":"Fat Boy Burgers. Local burger joint in Henderson.  I wasn't expecting much (just as another yelper mentioned).  It was pretty good!  I had a guacamole burger (protein style), my husband had the regular \"boyger\" and my daughter was supposed to have a kids burger but they gave us a regular one because they were out of the kids one.  We also had the chili cheese fries on thick fries, mozzarella sticks and my daughter had regular thin fries.  Everything was pretty good.  I think I like the thin fries over the thick ones.  The fries were seasoned...they were good.  Mozzarella sticks weren't the best that I've had, but still pretty good.   Overall this place is worth trying.  Especially I'm a fan of supporting local.  We will probably come back.  They have a variety on their menu too...I would like to try out their pizza and burritos next time."}
{"text":"I work close by and there's not a lot of places that serve veggie burgers so I thought I would give this place a try. Well I'm glad I did, this was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. I tried their veggie quesadilla and coworkers of mine have tried their pizza and we all agree the food is consistently delicious. The staff is always friendly, and the food is always fresh and on time. So glad I stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"They have some really good burgers! I will definetly be coming back. For my first time here I really enjoyed my meal, the cashier was really friendly, I love that they have there own merchandise such as stickers and shirts with there logo, and they deliver too with grub hub that's a plus, Since I live a bit far from it. Overall good place to try it's not some high end restaurant but I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.  Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.  I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a \"BLT Sandwich\" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for \"Chencho Fries\" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a \"Pastrami Boyger\" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!  This time hubby went with a full on \"Pastrami Sandwich\" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14\" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back!   They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too."}
{"text":"This place has everything you're looking for when it comes to good food, burgers, pizza, burritos, chicken fingers, salads literally a taste for everyone and the prices are really great! The guy who took my order didn't just call my order for me to pick up at the front, he brought it to my table and asked me if I needed anything else with my food. He really treated us well and even cleared our table when we finished. Really great experience overall and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Just recently found out about this place on Yelp and decided to check it out since I was craving for some pastrami!   I ended up ordering the pastrami boyger combo which came with fries and a drink. I chose the skinny fries instead of the steak cut version. The fries were crispy and had some seasoning on them which was a nice plus.  The burger was a bit on the smaller side, but it really packed a flavor that is full of deliciousness! The patty was juicy and there was a good amount of pastrami along with some onions, and pickles. I used to go to the Hat back in Cali whenever I wanted some pastrami and I got to say that this will be my go to place until I go back home.   I would highly recommend visiting this place and getting a boyger! I actually went back a second time with friends because I was craving the pastrami boyger again lol. Next time I come here, I'll try a different item so I can make more recommendations. The staff was very nice and welcoming and they have some pretty good deals for pizza, wings, and a bunch of other stuff."}
{"text":"2nd time here in a week  The Chencho Fries & a Double Cheese burger !!!!"}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place for so long? It's down the street and pretty awesome.  One thing I was bummed about was that they didn't have restroom. You would have to go to the bar or laundromat next door.  The place itself is pretty small but there's enough room to eat where you don't feel squished by each table/chair.  I wasn't really hungry but I did order 8 hot wings. Can't beat the price! They are a mix of buffalo and Tapatio. Did not expect that but it was very much enjoyable thought I needed a few cups of water while getting through it.  My visit was short but I'm really looking forward to coming back and trying more things on the menu for such a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Cinco Di Mayo for the first time. Hole-in-the-wall kind of place but those are sometimes the best....sometimes. I ordered a Philly and my daughter got the cheese boyger. Both were excellent and made very well. The only issue that I had was the mariachi music that they had playing loudly. But I figured that was just cause of the day we visited.   We returned for some more excellent food a few days later. This time I brought my son with. I ordered the cheese boyger and my son got the chicken fingers. Not thinking much about the music from the previous visit, we ordered to eat in. My BAD! Mariachi music AGAIN! Come on! OK, at least the food was pretty good last time so we'll tolerate it. NOPE, not this time. It was completely different staff. The first time was all male staff and today was all female. Completely different quality of food. The \"boyger\" was ordinary and my son only had a few bites of his chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were very low quality IMO and tasted like it was fried in old oil.   Unfortunately this place lacked the consistency any restaurant needs. It was really good on our first visit and mediocre at best on our 2nd visit. And the mariachi music just made it that much more undesirable."}
{"text":"What are the qualities of a good burger?  It takes a lot to stand out but I've been disappointed so many times that perhaps we need to cover the main principles- a burger bill of rights if you will.    The burger needs to be born of fresh, handmade patties - not frozen, preformed garbage.    If someone isn't asking you whether you want your burger medium rare, then it needs to be juicy, and not a dried out fast food puck.    It needs to have a bun that doesn't overpower the burger itself.  Hey - I'm all for \"artisan buns\" but how often have you ordered from a place that praised their bakery buns and then found your burger to be a bread sandwich?  Yuck.  It needs to be decently priced, more from the In-N-Out school of economics than Shake Shack.  Quick side note - I dig Shake Shack a lot but just try to have a burger, fries and drink for less than $15!  So - I think you get the idea.  Nobody needs or is looking for another half-hearted attempt at a burger joint when we already have so many choices in town.  Thus, I am shocked (and elated) to say that Fat Boy, this unassuming (dare I say, generic) strip mall restaurant hidden near McDonald Highlands off of Horizon Ridge has the most amazing burgers I've had throughout the ENTIRE valley.  They nailed every criteria -- Seriously.  I can't speak to the rest of their menu which seems to offer WAY more things than any reasonable restaurant should ever attempt (Mexican, Pizza, Calzones, Cheese Steaks, Breakfast Sammies, Salads, Wings) LOL  -- Really???  :)  Still, these are the BEST burgers I have had in a LOOONG time and now that I've been there twice, I feel I need to get the word out.  The first time I was there, I got the double cheese with pastrami (California razor thin style - like The Hat or Johnnies, or most \"Greek\" Burger places if you're from LA like me) shoestring fries (choice of skinny or fat - nice) and it was absolutely delicious.  The patties seemed to be roughly 1/4 pound but they also have a \"monster\" version which I haven't tried as yet.  I can't imagine how big those are as I was being rolled out of the restaurant with just the \"standard\" double.    Second time was a chili double cheese and the chili was meaty and a nice complement to the burger itself.  Yum!  Kids meals are great and oh-so reasonable-- my daughters \"ketchup only\" burger was under $2- nice bargain and she seemed to really enjoy it.    The place is family owned and they are phenomenally nice and truly interested in making sure you're happy with your food.  Anyway...nuff said other than we need to support indie restaurants that have excellent food at reasonable prices.  Fat Boy gets five stars (I'd give six if I could) and deservedly so--we can't wait to go back and hope you'll agree what a diamond in the rough this unassuming yet surprisingly fantastic place is."}
{"text":"My mind was BLOWN by how good their burgers were! I got the veggie patty boyger with all the toppings and honestly wanted another. The prices are really good and their burger was better than most fast food places i've gone to."}
{"text":"The family and I came here today.  I ordered the guacamole boyger with the chencho skinny fries.  My brother ordered the the pastrami boyger and also the same fries.  We asked for the burgers to be cut in half because we wanted to share and I'm glad we did.  Both boygers were awesome!  Fries were great! Will be back for sure.  We were a party of 8 and they accommodated all of us in there perfectly.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim one day. Food was amazing service was awesome and we continue to go here for burgers. Onion rings are top 5 favorite as well."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in North Las Vegas. Locally owned, not a franchise or chain, serving up some tasty home style burgers in a home style restaurant. The ladies looked busy, but still greeted us and at the same time, a whole group of kids came in for a bite after soccer practice. Next thing you know, the soccer coach is taking our order!?!?  He happens to be the husband/owner with his wife(and also works the evening shift at Fat Boy) who is busy busting out the kids orders, and her other worker is also family, and its also her birthday, so everyone starts singing Happy Birthday which truly brightens her day. I just love businesses that display a strong sense of family/community on top of serving up good, honest food.  I went with the owners suggestion of their popular Pastrami Boyger, and Wifey went with a Bacon Cheese Boyger, and we shared an order of fat Chencho  Fries.  The fries were good, but not something I'd order again. The burgers alone are what I'd return for. They don't have crazy toppings and add-ons like the trendier burger joints, their burger meat is well seasoned and fresh, never frozen, and burger buns are delivered fresh daily. The price points for their items are crazy cheap too! Went back the following weekend and tried their Guacamole Boyger and that was just as good!  Other reviews cap on their location but hey, they seem to be doing fine right where they're at, and being in business for five years, they must be doing something right!? I base my restaurant reviews on two things: FOOD and SERVICE atmosphere and location aren't an issue for me. It shouldn't be for you either, if you're looking for solid burgers and great service. Their Pizza and Wings looked good too, so we'll definitely be back. Check them out if you haven't yet.  ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite burger joint! Fresh ingredients. A touch of their personal flavor. Family operated and owned. The place is awesome!  O yea, they have tons of other yummy things on their menu. Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers and shakes are on point.  Owners are as nice as can be.  Great mom and pop place."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I would like to see them use a diffrent bun for there burgers. Grocery store bought buns sucked.  They should order them from another local business like great buns, fresh daily,  it kinda took away from the flavor of the HB. Also the hamburgers we order were really over cooked and over seasoned. The mark of an inexperianced cook, remember ground beef only needs to reach.155  degree's for 15 seconds not 15 hrs. I give FAT BOY 3 stars. Given its location the inside of the restaurant is very clean the people are great very friendly.  I will go back. I hope they make some changes. They really should get 3 1/2 stars because all ingredients were fresh except the buns."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the Hawaiian boyger and onion rings! I always have a good experience when I stop in. They're fast, delicious, and employees are always so welcoming!"}
{"text":"My son and I were getting ready to turn into a Mickey D's when I asked him if he'd like to try something new.   I had just read about this place last night and was dying to try it.  We were pleasantly surprised.   My son had the monster boyger with bacon and fat fries and I had the guacamole boyger with cheese and skinny fries.  Burgers were juicy and fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   We both left full and vowing to return soon."}
{"text":"Omg love the turkey boyger and chencho fries so much I just had to have some on my birthday... I love the salads and the chicken too! Recommend this place."}
{"text":"The burger was well worth the drive...soooo good!! I found the place on Yelp as I was in desperate need of a good HOMEMADE burger...none of the chains would do. This place EXCEEDED my expectations and I will DEFINITELY be back. Pluses: affordable, clean, and great customer service."}
{"text":"I would drive by the restaurant everyday and rarely noticed until it was recommended by a friend. One boyger later, I was hooked and eat there at least once a week ever since. Great food, great staff and great prices."}
{"text":"The food was good. Part of my order was left out of my bag. I did have to go back to get it but was given complementary food. Good customer service."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place ordered their pastrami boyger man I'll tell yah that stuff was delicious and juicy!!! I shared it with my dad and he loved it as well. But for sure I'll come back again !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large Cheese Pizza which was spot on! My son loved it, and he's very picky. French fries were very good. Steak fries nice and crispy outside, soft inside, not soggy at all. Husband ordered a ground beef wet burrito. The meat was not ground beef as he was told it would be. He asked), and was tough. I had the ground beef quesadilla. It had no flavor at all, and the tortilla was raw chewy. It was our first time having their food. When my husband was greeted, the person behind the counter suggested the burgers, which we did not get. We will give this place another chance because the pizza and fries were so good. Other reviewers rave about the burgers. Perhaps they should cut out the Mexican food. Just focus on what you excel at. Leave the Mexican food for the Mexican restaurants. :)"}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I thought I'd give Fat Boy a chance.  I arrived about 11:20 am and the place was empty except for the 2 workers that were sitting at a table and were eating.  I was not greeted or welcomed and I grabbed a menu and set down at a table to decide what I wanted.  I ordered a hamburger and skinney fries and the lady fixed my order while the male continued to eat.  I was given an empty cup and got my own drink from the drink dispenser, the food came at a reasonable time, and I ate my food.  The hamburger was thicker than what you get a most places with a nice slice of tomato and onion.  The fries were ok, nothing special.  I did not order the special fries, but  wished I had after eating.  I was told thank you by the lady as I was leaving but nothing was said to me while eating or was I ever acknowledged otherwise.  I was given a bottle of ketchup, but I did not see nor was I given a fork for my fries and did not see any anywhere.  There was no salt, condiments, or extra napkins on the table.  My burger was OK, but not anything special that would make me think this was a great place  If this review had any positive results, I would hope it would be that the owners see and read my review and see how important it would be to be friendlier, acknowledge their customers, and ask if everything is OK and do I need anything else....if they want me to return.  I also believe that every place needs to be given a chance and if you eat there and enjoy it...post it and when I see positive comments, I'll give them another try....It may have been an off day."}
{"text":"We live out of town and this was the first time we've eaten here, and it was awesome!!  I had the pastrami burger with their steak fries... it was so delicious!!  Their steak fries are some of the best I've ever had!!  My daughter had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and she loved it!!  She said it was so cheesy!!  And the owner was very sweet and nice!!  We will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. A future recommendation would be to have milk or juice available for the kids. The dining area is small but the business is small so it follows. I would also order ahead in the future for pick up. Truly kind, good service and very clean!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Went for my first time here and it was soo good! It reminds me of my LA burger spot. I've been looking for a spot like this for almost 2 years since I've lived here in Vegas and the prices are so affordable! Bomb ass burgers and the fries,omg! #futurecustomer PROS:very friendly, deal prices, bomb food, 10min. Wait for 4 boygers and big bag of fries, looks family oriented, there doing really good since there opening a new restaurant in Henderson CONS: not a very big spot but it's not a deal breaker, could add more color to it, didn't like the wings(could be better). But I will for sure be coming here from now on! :) Food rating(from me) A"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! It's Family ran, You don't find that to often these days!! The owner and his family are super hospitable making your dining experience for a fast food better then most restaurants!! There food is made fresh to order and there burgers are off the chart!! If you are from Cali and missing the HAT this is the place to come for one of the best pastrami sandwich here in Henderson!! Treat your taste buds they will love you for it!! This will always be a must for us!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday since we were on that side of town. It was amazing just like the first time. I ordered the chencho fries and the pepperoni calzone. The fries were the best as always and the calzone was really delicious. They were really generous with the pepperoni and the crust was out of this world. I do have one complaint. The calzone was pretty greasy. That doesn't matter though. I enjoyed my experience at Fat Boy and will return soon."}
{"text":"Some old fashion burgers cooked from scratch the monster burger is delicious you also pick your toppings they have a morning special for breakfast burgers that include of choice of ham, bacon, sausage.  With egg and some trimmings ita really good to be honest I love hot wings and theres are okay,  I perfer my wings to be swimming in my hot sauce that there tossed in there fries are delicious there stake style but they also offer shoestring fries too.  Give them a try you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"a friend and I stopped by on a whim after searching for great cheeseburgers around us. Read some reviews and decided to stop in, Very pleasant, friendly place, burgers were hot and very tasty and fries were great, i had the steak fries, friend had the onion rings, all very good. a few other customers had arrived before us and were talking at tables around us, couldnt help but notice as thier food arrived it started to get quiet in the dining room, i looked around and it was because everyone was eating. :) conversations gradually started picking back up as they finished thier meals. That advertising is pretty hard to beat."}
{"text":"UPDATE/// They have replaced the cashier and all is right with the world! Friendly staff and I still love their burgers! Back to 5 stars!  Now normally this is one of my fav spots....the burgers are soooo delicious and you have to try the Chencho Fries also, the owner is always super friendly and just a really nice guy.  But, they got a new cashier and she is HORRIBLE!!!! She NEVER smiles and always has an attitude.  Everytime i see her in front i know its going to be an additional 15 minute wait because she has no idea what she is doing and cannot multi task.  I am pretty sure she overcharged me today too.  Normally a 5 star worthy place but with this employee it brings down the whole business!"}
{"text":"My second review. Extremely impressed once again-- ordered the philly cheese steak this time & ordered the fried mushrooms to try. Amazing!!! Everything made to cook and fresh!!! Also, wonderful staff & customer service! Good job, Fat Boy! Can't wait to try something new!.... :))"}
{"text":"Had the guacamole & monster burgers with fat fries and onion rings 2 sodas $20. The food was delicious. No complaints. Left satisfied.  new burger spot for us."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmark list for awhile. I actually used to work in this area 5 years ago and always passed it on Stewart but didn't try it. I was reassigned a different location for work on Nellis so it's pretty much on this side of town. Finally came in on my lunch break and I ordered the burger and fries. I ordered ahead of time since I only have 30 minutes. To be honest, I was underwhelmed. This burger tasted homemade and to me that's not a good thing if it's something I can make at home. There was nothing special about it at all? No special sauce, typical hamburger bun, shredded lettuce and tomato. Umm did I miss something from all the reviews on how awesome the food is here. Although maybe I should of tried the checo fries or burrito? But the pictures look underwhelming as well. The inside is definitely a mom and pop shop, so it can use some upgrades or if they had the budget for it a major facelift would be even better. I'm not sure if the family that owns this place was working but the woman who rang up my food was friendly. If I give them another chance I'll be sure to ask Melissa Y. what to order since her review raves about this place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, it's kinda like a hidden gem that many don't know about (well that's how I feel about it). The food is pretty good, the staff are very nice and the prices are fair for some awesome food!"}
{"text":"Good food and cheap prices? Sounds like a winner to me! I came here with my friend and shared chencho fries. She got a cheese boyger and I got a turkey boyger.   Chencho fries: fries in salsa and cheese, we got an egg on top too. It was an interesting concept, different from anything I've tried. I thought these were alright. The person at the register said people like to put pastrami. I think it could have used some meat and maybe some sour cream  Turkey boyger: very flavorful and cheap! I really liked it. It was juicy and I enjoyed the sauce!  My friend seemed happy with her burger too.   I think I'll come back and try the pastrami burger, it sounded interesting."}
{"text":"Fat Boy's was the perfect spot for our group, as we were looking for a quick, simple local spot with a diverse and inexpensive menu.  If you're looking for something healthy and refreshing, go elsewhere... but if you're looking for a tasty, greasy, divey meal, this is your place.  I chose a Cheesesteak with Fat Boy fries and it hit the spot.  Most in our group grabbed a burger and they were pleased as well.   Pros: quick, friendly staff, diverse menu, tasty eats, good seating layout for groups   Cons: a little pricier than comparable restaurants, nothing unique or exceptional"}
{"text":"Well, I hate it when I have to go back to change a review, but I'm unable to leave this as a 5 star. It's been going steadily downhill for the past four months. Today was the worst.  I'd been talking this place up to friends and family since they opened. Today y Dad said he was in the mood for a good cheeseburger and wanted to try Fat Boy. I placed the order to go, two cheeseburgers and two fries to go at 10:50. There was a table of 4 ahead of me.  At 11:20 my order was ready, before the family of four got their food! Took lunch to my Dad.  1. Burger bun was stale and hard 2. Burger was dry 3. No dressing of any kind 4. Fries were cold  I was embarrassed I had talked about this place and had my Dad excited for a great burger. We didn't finish it, that bad. Not sure what happened to this place, but quality of food and service is gone."}
{"text":"Defintely will be visiting this place again!! Followed fellow yelpers there and is did not disappoint. Great fresh burgers at good prices. Any place that offers FAT or skinny fries is good in my book. I need to try those Chencho fries next, they look good. Only drawback is its on the opposite side of town and is really small."}
{"text":"I love Fat Boy's deals. We recently ordered 16 chicken fingers, fries and 2 liter for 23.99. If you're a chicken finger addict like myself, you know they can cost $10 for just 5. so for 16 chicken fingers at a great deal, I jumped at this awesome price. I placed an order on the phone and my boyfriend went to go pick it up. It was awesome. Great tasting, great price. I definetly wanna try the burgers next time because those are what they're known for. It's down the street from me so i'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers!!!! I've recently started ordering other things on menu and can't decide what is my favorite menu item. It's all so Good!!!! The new Chencho Quesadilla is \"Da Bomb\" I drive from across the valley to come here when I crave it."}
{"text":"Fatboys is AMAZING. Abel the owner and his wife are such hard workers. They're always in the kitchen ready to take care of you. Abel knows our orders off the top of his head, he really cares about his customers.  The burgers are GREAT. We always get the bacon cheeseburger. Seriously, every single bite is perfection. You get an even amount of everything on your burger and it's portioned perfectly. The fat fries are great too.   This place is great, eat here!"}
{"text":"I got the pastrami burger and it's delicious. The skinny fries are seasoned perfectly and crunchy. The staff is incredibly nice and welcoming. Super bonus, their soda fountain is Coke products! The price was like a chain fast food or cheaper and it's way better. I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Best family owned burger joint in town!! The classic \"boygers\" are fantastic! They have pizza, wings, quesadillas, burritos, tons and tons of choices! We've been coming here for years and have not a single complaint. The same guys is always working here lol Try the \"Fat Chencho Fries\" and the \"Hawaiian Boyger\" you will not be disappointed. The have a  four 1/2 lbs burgers, basket of fries and 2 liter soda for only  $26.  You can also try 32 wings, 2 liter soda and basket of fries for $24."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! They already know my boyfriend's name as soon as we walked in. I always get the Hawaiian boyger with fries and strawberry shake. It's always the same and even better everytime I get it. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The best burgers in town!  It's a little business but McDonalds don't have nothing on Fat boy's.  The pastrami cheeseboyger  is ssssssooooo delicious and the fries with seasoning are so tasty.... You have to try it! Oh and the staff are very friendly, and clean."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and was craving wings. I was a first timer and she's here  a couple of times. I got wings and fries with a soda. The fat fries are really good! They made everything to order. My friend got the chencho fries and they were really good! Different from just Carne Asada fries.   Overall it was okay but the guys were super nice.  It was Hot in the restaurant so that kind of sucked.  Their menu was extensive and I wanted to try everything.  The wings weren't spicy and were pretty tiny.  I give it a five just because the guys were nice.  And I loved the fat fries.  TIP! get the chencho fries in a burrito! They'll special make it!"}
{"text":"Fat Boy is not the place for anyone that has weight-loss as their New Year's resolution. However, it is the perfect place for anyone that's in the mood for a good burger at a great price.   Fat Boy serves burgers, cheese steaks, burritos, quesadillas, pastrami sandwiches/burgers, chicken wings/tenders, and of course the all-time fattie food...pizza.  I just gained 10 lbs. writing this.  Fat Boy is local and has everything that a \"hole in the wall\" burger joint has minus the drive thru.  They have a list of fun fattie food, but it's the burgers that they are known for.  I got the Dbl Monster Chz Boyer (double cheese burger), which is also their most expensive item at only $8.59.  Can you say \"meal at a steal\"? I also added an egg and piece of bacon for $1.90.  Price is dirt cheap and if value is what you're looking for, then look no further because all of the prices at Fat Boy is as good as it gets.  The name of my burger was fitting because it was a beast.  As for taste, it was a good thing that I had an egg, cheese, and bacon added to it because I thought that it was on the dry side.  It was still tasty, but just missed the juicy beef taste that I was craving.  The bun also got a little soggy from all the grease.  Don't get me wrong, my double was still a very good burger.  Maybe I just expected too much with some of these 5 star reviews.    I'm sure that I will be back.  I still want to try their pastrami burger, the cheese steak, and maybe add some of their fat fries next time.  The amount of options here is good.  The value is even better.   TIP #1:  Add an extra-large patty for $3.00.   TIP #2:  Additional Toppings cost about $1.00  2017 Yelp Review #68"}
{"text":"Been to this place several times and I tell you I don't have one complaint it's always been delicious and fresh. Anytime I'm on the east I stop in by the way I'm going there in a little while :) mouth is drooling from looking at the pics. Don't let the couple of one star yelpers turn you away you won't be disappointed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Like this little place. Clean, friendly and very accommodating. Great little mom and pop operation....their second location. I love the turkey burger!"}
{"text":"It exceeded my expectations by a mile. I had the pastrami boyger with chencho fries. Best part about it is the fact that you dont feel a disgusting greasy after-effect. Service was on point as well...absolutely a return spot!"}
{"text":"Now I feel fat. Oh boy...  Fat Boy has been around for at least a few years, but it took a while for me get to them even after they opened up this, their second store. I followed a food truck to the neighborhood and realized it was right across the street from this restaurant, so I went here first. It was quiet in the mid-morning until a birthday party full of young kids and their mothers arrived, and then all heck broke loose. I'd definitely suggest dining in unless you leave nearby.  All orders are taken at the counter right below a huge version of their menu, which is full of casual, comforting food featuring \"boygers\" and \"boyrritos\" (cutesy pronunciations of burgers and burritos) as well as sandwiches, quesadillas, pizza, chicken, sides, and the unusually out-of-place salads. They also do larger family-size orders that could be nice for a group. I wanted to try more things, but I was pretty stuck as a solo diner and only was able to get to a few items.  Double Cheese Boyger ($5.74) - bun, patties, cheese, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, relish, mustard. Also added bacon ($0.95) to mine. I'll note that the monster versions are larger and have thousand island instead of mayo, per the cashier, and that this size of a burger is plenty of lunch, per yours truly.  All the ingredients are delicious and harmonious, and nothing is wasted, although the bacon may not have been entirely necessary. Yes, I even enjoyed the bun and the pickles, and I didn't mind the gray meat. It's definitely one of the best casual burgers around, and I did not miss the lack of the thousand island style of sauce.  Fries ($1.75) - I went with the fat fries, which are steak fries. They're properly seasoned, unlike one popular alliterative avian chain, and they're cooked to a nice crunchy golden brown. I really appreciated the traditional plastic ketchup bottle (which the cook brought out cold alongside my order) because it was easy to squeeze small amounts directly onto the thick fries. I'd like to try the skinny fries next time to make a comparison. Those fries can probably work with the usual squirt-then-dip ketchup method.  Philly Cheese Steak ($5.99) - I simply haven't found a great version of this sandwich yet, and this one pretty much matched my low expectations. Decent chewy bread, thinly shaved steak, melted cheese, and onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms sound great, and while I did enjoy it as a to-go / leftover dish, this kinda sandwich just doesn't ever seem to pop for some reason. I wish that I'd been able to use a cheese sauce, which really does seem to help this type of sandwich out.  I'll definitely be back to Fat Boy to get more boygers and to try out some other options. Henderson may not have all the types of non-chain businesses that I want, but places like this are showing that it doesn't lack for good food."}
{"text":"Two words : chencho fries! Don't think just try you'll be hooked. Great atmosphere and generous portions. The burgers are made with quality ingredients. This place  is seriously good! The menu is vast and is sure to satisfy any appetite. Burgers, pizza, burritos, chicken fingers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Despite living only a mile away, this was my first time there.  Had chicken wings, a single burger, and skinny fries. I ordered he wings medium hot, and got a nice, pleasant level of heat. I think the fries were seasoned with hot spice as well, but I'm not sure (since I was eating the wings at the same time.) For some reason I just love it when my burger has a toasted bun. Everything tasted good and I was very happy with my meal.  One note:  the dining area is kind of small (seats less than 20 people). There was only one table available when I placed my order, though a couple others had been vacated by the time I was served."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers! Just had the Monster Double Burger and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Bang in' ass spot. All the basic tastebud cravings.\"Double Pastrami Cheese Burger\"... Come check 'em out"}
{"text":"Fat Boy is AWESOME!  Yep, that about sums it up in a nutshell!  Haven't been there yet?  Well, pack you bags and take a trip to the East side of Vegas for some tasty grub.  Here's why I am a big fan of Fat Boy:  1. The vastness of the menu! This joint has something for everyone.  They have burgers, pizza, chicken, and Mexican food all on their menu.  If you an't find something you like on the menu, you are definitely missing out!  2. The burgers (boygers) are yum-tastic! I  They are all super tasty and some of the best I have had in town.  They are also a great deal for the price point.  $3-5 for a freshly made burger is a-ok in my book!  3. The fries are great!  They have the thick, steakhouse stye fries.  A regular order comes with a fun season salt mix on them that tastes great.  You can also try their chencho fries that are covered in a green chili sauce and cheese.  They are a fun dish to chow down on for sure.  4. The prices are fantastic.  Your money definitely goes a long way here.  You can get a yummy lunch and be full all day for under $10 out the door.  They also have family deals like 4 burgers, 4 fries, and a 2 liter of soda for $18.  Not to shabby.  I always love great food for cheap.  Bottom line, I really enjoy Fat Boy and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty lunch.  If you are on that side of town, go check them out to make your belly happy!  FYI, it is in a small strip mall and you may drive right past it.  You have to be on the look out for it.  It's on the NE corner of Stewart and Lamb."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of the best burgers in Las Vegas! It is about 10 to 15 minute drive off the strip but well worth it. They have Burgers, pizzas, chili fries, and all sorts of other delicious stuff. It is a tradition for us, whenever we visit Vegas, to get off the plane, and head right over to Fatboy."}
{"text":"Fresh,hot, great flavor. I'm going to be. Repeat customer for sure. Try it out via Uber eats if you can't make it to the location it self."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza!! Good hamburgers! Awesome fries. This place is all of the above PLUS affordable. Lots of specials running and a family-owned business with attention to customers being a priority. The burgers are hand-pattied and flavorful. I recommend the chencho fries and the guacamole \"boyger\" with a fried egg added."}
{"text":"Great quick eats! We picked up Fat boy for dinner, and we were all pleasantly surprised. Very reasonably priced, and nice sized portions. The cheese burger was fat, and delicious. I got mine with the skinny fries, and they were delicious. My husband got the cheese steak and he devoured it in minutes. We were very pleased with our dinner, and we plan to be back for more eats!   Next time we plan to try their chicken wing family special!"}
{"text":"All the hype on Yelp did not impress me as my expectations were not met. We ordered 2 double cheeseburgers and requested both medium cooked, onion rings, and fries. The burgers lacked juices and taste. It was cooked well done, but nothing stood out about it. We were disappointed.  Service was great. I love different burgers with flavor and unique taste like Bachi Burger or Inn n Out."}
{"text":"My hubby found this gem by riding by on his bike. So Friday nights we go out as a family... a perfect time to try this out!  Very friendly and professional family staff welcomes you. We ordered boygers all around and everyone loved them. A family of 4 got all combos (boyger, fries and drinks) cost only 33 bucks. Our normal amounts paid are around 50. A steal!!  We will be back. ****since this last review we went back a month after- awesome burgers, Caesar salad was so good, and I tried the chicken burrito.... DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN BURRITO. It looked like someone already chewed it up on their mouth and carefully placed it in a tortilla. Gross. I resorted back to a cheese burger after all that."}
{"text":"Well, not bad but just ok.  I'm continuing to find it hard to locate good pie in southwest - I'm sure there are good places for pizza but I just haven't found them yet.  Not a bad place though...but I should have tried the burger.  A few came out of the kitchen while we were waitin and they looked pretty solid.  I'd come again - but I'd pass on the pizza."}
{"text":"This was the best place to eat the food was amazing and the prices r very reasonable. The employees were very good and u can choose from big fries which r steak fries or just regular skinny fries. The food was delicious and I will definitely be back again was not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger was delicious.  I could go on and on about it but to the point it was very tasty and worth stopping in.  I stopped in early around 1030, they made everything fresh and was quick about it.    Definitely worth stopping in and eating a burger."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my boy friend and his kids. it doesn't look like much on the outside but our experience was satisfying. i ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich it has lettuce tomato and mayo I also added cheese and pickles. It came as a sandwich or combo with fries and a drink. (i got the combo) the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I got the fat fries which were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. my food was overall delicious. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito enchilada style (wet according to them) with the red sauce. i stole a bite and it was perfectly spicy. The meat was tender and yummy. They had a kid friendly menu too. we ordered a jr. boyger and chicken nuggets and french fries for the littles which they ate up super fast. The chicken nugget eater is pretty picky so we were surprised when he asked for more. The prices are affordabke and the food was prepared fast. This is a LOCALLY owned business by friendly people in our community which is a definite plus. We will for surebe back soon!."}
{"text":"Ever since the owner of Sammy's LA Pastrami became hands off and the quality has gone to shit, I've been desperate for some good Pastrami. I had the Pastrami Burger and it was fantastic definitely as good as if not better than Sammy's when it was great. Also had a few bites of their spicy chicken sandwich. Can't wait to come back and try some more food."}
{"text":"We went on Friday night.  Burger was okay.  My main issue was that the menu board said it came with onion, tomato, lettuce, and mayo. I asked for no onion.  But when I got my burger it had mustard and relish all over the meat.  So annoyed.  I used napkins to get as much of it off.  I was not going to ask them to remake- it takes them 20 minutes.  I could have went anywhere else and gotten a burger in half the time."}
{"text":"I've stopped in to grab food to go twice now and I can say I'm a fan. The burger is solid and the employees are very friendly and welcoming.   On both visits I was immediately greeted and asked if I wanted to order. They asked if it was my first visit and were happy to answer questions about the menu. The employees offer a genuine \"thank you\" to every customer. It's obvious that they appreciate their customers and take pride in their business. I love a good local business where this is the case.  The menu is interesting. They offer burgers (boygers as they call them), pizzas, sandwiches, and burritos. I love the combination. Fat Boy also offers breakfast items and I can't wait to try a breakfast burrito on my next visit. Pricing is very reasonable. On recent visit I was able to get two burgers and sides plus tip for less than $20.  The cheeseboyger is delicious. I love the flavor of the burger and the toppings that are included on their burgers. The delicious combination is chipotle mayo, pickles, onions, relish, mustard, lettuce, and tomatoes. Sometimes this many toppings can make a mess to eat, but the burgers are nicely wrapped so that everything stays together. The Onion Rings and Skinny Fries are also great. Neither is overly greasy, but they are crispy and have a nice flavor. My husband likes the Pastrami Boyger.   As some have mentioned, everything is made to order and expect to wait about 15 minutes for food preparation. Come prepared for a wait or call your order ahead like I saw many other customers doing while I waited."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner of my house. A friend and I went in and tried this place out. I had a double with cheese and bacon. Everything was fresh. My friend is a butcher. Even he says it was very fresh. Go in try a burger you won't be disappointed. There fries have not impressed me yet. I have not had a pizza yet. Soon I suppose. After I get burned out of these awesome burgers."}
{"text":"Nice, friendlygood cheeseburgers.   The Cheeseburgers are very similar in taste to an In-N-Out cheeseburger, just a little different.   Fries are big slices with seasoned salt and spice.   Drinks are free refills.   Just over 10 dollars for 2 cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink.   Overall pretty good.   P. S. The restaurant is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Finally tried something on my side of town!    Fat Boy is located on Stewart and Lamb, it's a little hard to find, but when you see the Llantera shop, turn there!    They serve burgers, pizza, sandwiches, and burritos.  I got a cheese boyger, my friend tried the turkey boyger, and we shared chencho fries with egg.  The chencho fries were pretty tasty.  It's fries, cheese, and green salsa.  The guy taking our order also said people like to add pastrami or bacon on top.  I think it would have been better if we added some meat because I felt like it was lacking one more topping.  I thought that the cheese and salsa was a good start though.  My cheese boyger was yummers!  It's a cheese burger with lettuce, tomatoes, chopped onions, and chipotle mayo. I liked how juicy the burger was and they didn't skimp on anything.  It reminded me of a Fat Burger, but without the hefty price.  For two burgers and fries it cost $11! What a sweet deal. I'm excited to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Love me a Boyger!  clean & cheap. great place for a burger on the Eastside of town.  They have everything to choose from to eat, they even have pizza, small nice place & real quick if they aren't busy.  If they are busy and you are hungry its definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"I'm so excited I came across Fatboy yesterday while searching for a new restaurant to try near me. Delicious food, clean establishment, nice accommodating staff, and cheap prices. We had the pastrami (boyger)cheeseburger combo with skinny fries, my nephew had a kids boyger with cheese and I had an order of pastrami chili cheese fries, their pastrami burger had all the right ratio of pastrami, burger and toppings, my pastrami chili cheese fries were perfect as well, I had the skinny fries, and asked if I could have onions added but couldn't decide if I wanted raw or grilled onions so the chef made me grilled onions on half and raw on the other half, that was really nice of him since I was so indecisive. We will definitely be frequenting this establishment when I'm in the mood for some great comfort food. I have already told a bunch of friends about this place, I love supporting locally owned small business owners."}
{"text":"Amazing pastrami with provolone with mustard and pickles!! The papas (fries) are amazing with the cold ketchup. All that with a cool Coca-Cola and a price that you won't find downtown. ($9).  My buddy ordered the double monster 1lb burger and it was falling apart which proves its not frozen!!  The place has it all, Mexican food and pizzas as well as burgers. Please all of your friends in this quaint diner.  They have signs all around advertising a future store in Henderson as well!"}
{"text":"Small local family owned restaurant the serve their signature hamburger called the pastrami boyger with seasoned steak fries. Didn't realize they had been around since 2008 on the east side of town.  They also serve a variety of burgers and pizza.   Went there for carry out - they do have 5-6 tables for dining in.  It reminds me of the mom and pop diners that I grew up with in the Midwest and dined at in Los Angeles.  Will have to put this on my go to for local eats and off off the strip favs - looking forward to trying the other dishes on the"}
{"text":"Love eating at hole in the walls and this is one of those A+ hole in the walls. Burgers are on point and their fat fries are the business. Definitely will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"Fat Boy is a hidden gem on the east side of Las Vegas. Their menu offers a range of food, but I go there for their burgers. Flavorful, cooked fresh, and quite filling, you can't beat the quality for cost -- in fact, Fat Boy's burgers may be better than In & Out! It always seems like the same guy is there to take your orders, and he's friendly and attentive as well. I'd highly recommend giving this place a try next time you're craving something new."}
{"text":"Oy! Sooo salty! The burgs are definitely meaty, but whoa! Can't get over how salty, like lip-puckeringly so."}
{"text":"Just got to Vegas yesterday and I am a big fan of exploring new places and finding hole in the wall food places. Fat Boy is exactly that. I had a medium Pepperoni pizza with mozzarella sticks and it was just under  $13!!?? Are you kidding me?? That is so cheap! The crust was soft but crispy and had a good texture and flavor. The pizza sauce was light and flavorful. There was plenty of cheese on it as well. I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Definitely try the Double Monster Chz boyger with Steak fries! Excellent prices. Hands down the best burger I've had. Must try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Had to do an update for Fat Boy.  This go-round I enjoyed their pizzas delivered! Yes indeedy, they do delivery... To my house anyway. ;)  Here's the scoop, we got 3 large pizzas and an order of mild wings. The delivery took just about 40 minutes. The guys delivering were super nice and the pizzas were damn good. I really liked the wings though.   Would I order from them again? Yep! Especially gotta get those chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my wife just to try it out-  she had the guacamole burger and I had the Hawaiian burger both were excellent and cooked to order.  The skinny fries were also perfect-    So far this is all we tried.  But it was so good that we will go back and sample additional items in the menu....   you should give it a shot if you are in the area..."}
{"text":"Been to the other location on the east side years ago and happy that the other location is close to my house. Definitely my favorite neighborhood burger spot. Love the staff here. Love the music they play. Such a great place tucked away on Horizon Ridge."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Just what I expected. Amazing food and friendly staff. We will be back. Everything is cooked fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Like always great customer service. The food is really good. I  always get the double monster burger. Their pizza taste really good the dough has a sweet and savory taste to it the sauce tastes homemade. You can't go wrong eating at Fat Boys you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Abel, Nancy, and the whole family at Fat Boy are wonderful! They accommodate my weird orders of giant platters of meat, and whatever spices/seasonings they use for their meat is phenomenal! I go there on almost a daily basis not only because it's both delicious and very affordable but they address me by name every time, always remember my order, and have some of the best customer service I've seen in a restaurant. Highly recommend for anyone and everyone looking for the best burger in town and more!"}
{"text":"I certainly can not argue this place. Clean, inexpensive, friendly staff, and most importantly, great food. I will just keep it simple and leave it at that. :-)"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and needed to check it out. The friendly helpful staff recommended different options. I am a huge Philly cheesesteak fan so I went with it. It was super delicious. I only wish the serving size was larger for a place called fat boy. It was so good though! I could go back and get three more! The plain fires are okay. I will try the special fires next time. Overall, great little place and I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now and the food Is always good! This a small family owned establishment. The customer service is always on point!! But it's the BOYGERS ( how they say burgers) is what keeps me driving way out of my way to come and eat!! Their burgers are always made to order! The food comes out fresh and hot. The burgers are so juicy and seasoned  to perfection and the fat fries tops it off!! This  is my go-to burger spot!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious!!! Meaty and cheesy, and great flavor. I unfortunately, didn't care for the chencho fries, the sauce had a very strong lime flavor, which I personally thought was a little odd. I will definitely be back for a juicy burger, but will order regular fries next time. My husbands fried mushrooms were pretty tasty. FYI, there is limited seating in here, you may want to get it to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food for super cheap prices. Great customer service. Everyone had a smile on their face even though I was there during the lunch rush and they were super busy. My family of four was able to eat for under $30 and our food came out quickly, all orders were correct, and the food was fresh! I appreciated the many options. The veggie burger was on point!"}
{"text":"Last night me and my girlfriend were in the mood for a giant juicy burger. We walked into Fat Boy and was instantly blown away by the delicious smell. I got the double cheese boyger w/ bacon and chencho fries. All of our food was at the table less than 10 mins, but that doesn't take from its quality. The burger was 10/10!! We prob said \"oh my god\" after every bite. The meat/bacon was cooked to perfection. The bun was fantastic as well. I'm a big fan of GOOD ranch dressing, and I was not let down. Dipping the burger/fries into the ranch and drowning it down with Coke was heaven! Only complaint was the chencho fries were \"too wet\" for our tastes. I have no idea why I took me so long to come here, living 5 minutes away couldn't be better. I will definitely frequent here more often."}
{"text":"Went to fat boys based off of reviews was not disappointed pizza made from scratch and completely tasty. Oven doesn't cut off til 1130 so pizzas are ready to order after 1130.  Pizza crust was incredible and it was all around great price for hi quality pizza, And i keep hearing bout boyers burgers gotta try next time."}
{"text":"I'd heard from a couple of coworkers about Fat Boy, and after I saw the good reviews on Yelp I knew I had to try them out. It doesn't hurt that they're fairly close to my apartment.  Super, SUPER glad I finally got to finally try them out tonight.  My girlfriend and I went in at about 7:30p - with four people already at tables eating, the place seemed half full; there's not a huge amount of seating in there. It's very much a hole in the wall, but not run down or even remotely divey. It's very well-lit, and the dining area is kept very clean. The menu is posted on the wall, but we were quickly given printed menus at the counter, which contain a few items that aren't on the wall menu. The burger prices may seem a tiny bit steep at first, but when you compare them to fast food they really aren't that much different. The clerk/cook was very friendly, and quick to apologize for our short wait.  I ordered a Monster Boyger, my girl ordered the Double Cheese Boyger combo, and we shared an order of the Chencho Fries; I also had to indulge in a bottle of Mexican Coke to wash it all down. Everything was just stupid delicious. I've already told a few people that the burger is my favorite in town; seasoned well, stacked but not overloaded with toppings, and HUGE. You can definitely taste that they're homemade. The Chencho Fries were just as good, though next time we may add some bacon or something just a little salty to the spiciness.  I can't give it the full five stars, as I haven't gotten the chance to try any of their pizza or other sandwiches; if those are as good as their burgers, that extra star may get added sooner rather than later. Definitely skip your normal fast food burger place and go here instead!"}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday for the first time.  Had the philly cheestake and onion rings. Both were very good. Staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Came to fat boy for the very first time like two days ago and the service was amazing I seriously give the lady a 5 star ! We didn't know exactly what to order and she recommended the most popular.. We had questions and she answered them really nicely and patiently! I was seriously satisfied.. The food is good as well I had chencho fries and they were delicious our hot wings were very good too.. I don't eat much and I ate everything because it was good.. The prices are fair and we will definitely be going back... My bf liked his food as well and we would like to try other things"}
{"text":"This is a legit burger joint!  Delicious burgers with tons of toppings and great buns. But the Onion Rings were even better. Some of the best I've ever head. Clean simple eat in area. Friendly staff. I believe they're also on UberEATS. I will be back sooner than I should be."}
{"text":"I've tried many things here, and never have been dis satisfied. From the pizza, to the angry burger and back to the basics of chicken fingers and fries all have been great. Will definetly keep coming to this place."}
{"text":"Alright so I bought a milkshake, A double cheese-burger and some chicken fingers.  They forgot my ranch, which is ok because my fatass doesn't need it.  I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5, or a 7 out of 10, or a 49 out of 70 or a 77 out of 110. I'd recommend it if you live on the East Side/Sunrise of Vegas.  It was good, but it was alright ya know. It's like watching a good movie on Netflix on a really boring night. It's like the 2nd Fast and the Furious movie. You're like, \"I think I've seen this before.\" But can't really point it out.  Not better than Passion of the Christ. Definitely not better than the Lethal Weapon 4."}
{"text":"Awesome boyger, pizza and chicken wings! Priced reasonably and they deliver via bitequad app. I would definitely recommend this place if u live near the area."}
{"text":"Love the burgers!!!! Love the onion rings and fat fries!!! Definitely our go to burger place!!"}
{"text":"Gave the new Fat Boy location a try on opening day. Staff was very friendly and inviting. I had never been to the original location. I talked with several patrons that were regulars at the other restaurant and they commented the new location was just as good. Small dining area inside with around 7 tables. Soda fountain available as well as bottled sodas/water.   They have quite a few options on the menu and reasonable prices. I tried the cheeseboyger and fat fries. Classic seasoned salt on fries was good. My girlfriend had the pastrami boyger with fried mushrooms and ranch as the side. Burger patties were fresh/hand made and very good. Everything comes out well done by default. Also tried the carne asada boyrrito. Tasty steak and large size but a bit dry. Need to try with the red sauce next time.   Overall good experience with good value. Liked everything we ordered and want to support local small business owners. Will be back soon to try the pizza and desserts."}
{"text":"When it comes to variety and delicious food, Fat Boy tips the scale. This is the original Fat Boy that has developed such a high reputation for its delicious food that recently they opened a second location in Henderson.   Although this would be my sole visit to this Fat Boy, I had visited their Henderson location three times. These visits exposed me to tasty comfort food that included the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, pastrami sandwich,  monster cheeseburger, and fat fries. In similar fashion to a Beatles tune, everything was off the charts good. The Henderson Fat Boy is another review for another time. In perspective to this review, it was important to relate to the fact that I was so impressed with the food and service that I would try the original one when I was in the area.     It was a few Sundays ago when I was driving with an appetite on the east side of Las Vegas on my way home from Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge. A mental bookmark illuminated. It said \"Fat Boy.\"     This mental bookmark was erased when I pulled into an old shopping center at the northeast corner of Lamb Boulevard and Stewart Avenue. It was a short walk to the original Fat Boy. My first impression was that if I was a Fat Boy I'd have trouble maneuvering around the place. It is a small space with a couple of tables and just enough room for an overhead menu above the few tables on the right. Having dinner in this small space, I observed that there is a need for a restroom. The small dining area is the antithesis of the large dining area in Henderson. The food is just as grand.     Decisions! Decisions! I decided on their Monster Cheese Boyger (they call burger boyger) combo. The kid asked my name. At Fat Boy they call your name when it's ready. At the Henderson restaurant they had said \"Bye Daniel\"  whenever I left. The kid would tell me that it would be ready in about fifteen minutes. This brings up the point that Fat Boy is not fast food. Regardless that the setup is similar to a fast food restaurant, here the food is made after ordering. At the time I exchanged $8.24 plus tax for the Monster Cheese Boyger combo that included a fountain beverage and fat fries, they started cooking the food.     The fifteen minute wait was worthwhile. The Monster Boyger agreed with my taste buds. Two white buns anchored a thick burger covered with chipotle, mayonnaise, tomato, onions, lettuce, and ketchup. Sharing the same plate were the fat fries. This was a meal requiring napkins. I'd have to venture a couple of steps to the counter to ask for napkins.    By the time that I was in my car turning onto southbound Lamb Boulevard, it was with a satisfied impression of the original location. Fat Boy truly tips the scale when it comes to variety and good food. Ultimately when it comes to the Yelp scale, in my estimation the original Fat Boy weighs four stars."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Great fries. Great shakes. Great price. And it's family owned. Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Fat Boy was recommended by a friend and they did not disappoint! The cheese \"Boygers\" were delicious- juicy and fresh. The veggie boyger was amazing and we loved the fat and skinny fries. They have a wide selection of menu items, all reasonably priced. I highly recommend Fat Boy to anyone looking for a great burger."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new spot to eat while out yesterday.  I found Fat Boy was in my area and was worth the try. I am dang glad I did. My friend and me were floored by the service and portion size you get. I was highly impressed that while eating the burger, it stayed hot all the way to the last bite. I will be back here this week and will be a regular spot. Go to Fat Boy Now!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in adjoining plaza to the one where my wife's beauty parlor is located so stopped in after one of her appointments for lunch.  We each ordered the 1/4 pound fat boyger (sp) with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise with me upgrading the latter by requesting chipotle.  The burgers were very good, but a bit well done for our tastes so next time I would request medium rare.  I used a 2 for 1 coupon that a printed off the local zipcode magazine website making this a certified bargain. The owner or possibly the manager was very personable and inquired how we were enjoying our boygers."}
{"text":"Family friendly, great staff & one of the best burgers I've had in a long time, I would definately recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times were amazing!! The burgers are worthy of praise. I loved having a choice of the type of fries (skinny or fat). The staff is very pleasant. The price is good for the quality of food. This is my new lunch spot at work."}
{"text":"Really good homemade comfort food here. The customer service is really good too. I was greeted right away and my order taken. Its located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. I had the cheese burger, chili cheese fat fries, Philly cheese steak and ground beef quesadilla. I liked everything so much I came back the same day to get some more food for dinner! Keep in mind that they have chipotle mayo, not regular mayo for their burgers which wasn't bad though. It wasn't spicy or bad. I will try their pizza next time since I was informed they make their dough daily!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning  o try this place for weeks now and just didn't get a chance till today, they have a breakfast sandwich special from 0900-1200, you choose from ham, bacon or sausage and it's $1.49 per sandwich, this is what enticed me to want to try this place plus the food looked really good for very cheap. This place reminds me of a very bare minimal hamburger joint and no special paint or decorations to make you want to stay and eat but it's ok because the food is the type you wanna take away and eat at a park anyway.   So I decided to try a ham and a bacon breakfast sandwich today and it has a fried egg, lettuce, tomato and a light amount of chipotle mayo (can barely taste it) for $1.49. The guy working the grill also puts the soft buns on the grill as well to give it a nice crisp putter while the inner stay soft.  Ohh my was these two sandwiches ONO (delicious) I'd highly recommend the ham because the bacon sandwich had two small pieces and could have used more, but they give you two fries ham slices on the ham which is perfect with all the other fix-ins. The only regret I have was not getting three of these."}
{"text":"Love this place! The chili cheese fries were so good! I am very very picky about the chili I eat and I can say this is one of the best! Prices are good, and restaurant is clean. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was great! Very reasonable prices for great food that's actually prepared. They have lots to choose from, so it's the perfect place for a group who can never agree on what they want. Get the Chencho Fries, you'll thank yourself."}
{"text":"Wanted to stop in and try this place as I heard it was locally owned. Stopped in with the kids and was immediately greeted by friendly staff. The gentleman that took our order was patient and helped us order. The food was great and extremely reasonably priced for what we got. Will definitely be coming back, must support hard working business owners."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall spot food is great and at a good price I've been back a few times since I first tried it I will be coming back and customer service is great   I recommend the boygers and the chicken fingers"}
{"text":"I just fell in love with this restaurant,  it's very clean and so easy to find great location for a quick bite to eat. Also have delivery thru Grub Hub and Bite Squad. Great customer service and very friendly there open to explaining their menu so much to choose from very delicious and really great Family and party packs at great prices. Also tried their avocado burger it was so good. It's family friendly and their menu it very well easy to read and choose but it's hard to choose just one thing as everything looks so good to try. I will be definitely coming back with my family. Also their Is no long waits there pretty fast service great drink selection and very affordable I was amazed by they quality of there ingredients they use very fresh and their patties are made to order and their ranch bowl is amazing their so generous with their ranch . Can't. Wait to Come back and order my next tail gate party wings and chicken fingers their prices are so amazingly cheap.. thank you Fat boy"}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try after driving by it numerous times and joked about eating there.  And then it happened.   Fat Boy is a tiny little restaurant that is hidden in East Las Vegas. The place seats about 15 people - it definitely has this homey, only-for-locals kind of feel to it.   I had a guacamole cheeseburger with fat fries, and the boyfriend had a chicken burrito with chencho fries.  I was half expecting the food to be overrated, but I was amazed at how fresh my burger was!  And how much I love my fries!!! I ADORE FAT FRIES!!!  The fries have these seasonings on them that just make them super yummy!  And they were FAT and huge!    The Chencho fries were covered with a green salsa and onions and cheese; it was yummy enough - a bit fattening though.   I have suggested to return to this place numerous times after the first encounter, and that is pretty rare for me.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious hamburger and their thick cut fries ! Great customer service as well ! Definitely going back because it's great food for a low cost! Too bad I live in California because I'm already craving some."}
{"text":"At first it doesn't look like much from the outside. Inside its clean, smells like a homemade burger shop and has a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Ordering for my big family was enjoyable, staff was patient, kind and attentive. Obviously ran by a family, father cooking and boys helping with everything else, that's something you don't see anymore, very cool! It took about 15 minutes for all the food to be ready, which was not bad timing for the size of my order. Everything was cooked to order and nothing was under, or over cooked. Food was hot fresh and delicious! We will be coming back and recommending it to all our friends."}
{"text":"Family-owned business, run by the family. Amazingly friendly. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. Order at the counter and they bring the food to you. It's like a sit-down restaurant experience with the staff checking on you from time to time. I love the atmosphere!  I had a protein boyger with bacon combo. The burger was well seasoned and delicious. All the cooking is done behind the counter, so you can see what's happening with your food. It's great not having to wonder about funny business you hear about some places.   A+ experience."}
{"text":"Always awesome food and the boygers are the best and fresh made. They also have excellent customer service and made me happy AF with that  guacamole burger with bacon , great jobs guys and gals"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I had a Hawaiian pizza and next time I hope to try their chencho fries. The place is quite small tho."}
{"text":"Fat boys Pastrami  and Hawalian Boyger are awsome  cooked fresh  chencho fries are also great . Fat boy restaurant has something for every one  from pizzas,wings ,FINGERS ,boygers Philly steaks ,and boyrritos"}
{"text":"Just taking a break from the snow in Reno.  We decided that we would do Vegas, but only go to local places...  Fatboy is AWESOME!  Obviously a Family run business, amazingly clean, friendly.  It's great to see a family working together.   I'd recommend this to everyone.  In fact... I think we will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The staff is very nice here, little quaint hole in the wall diner.  Seating area is extremely small with 5 (2)seat tables and 1 (2) seat table top.   Ordered the Double Monster Cheeseboyger with everything it came with steak fries and was so filling.  The boyger was dressed for consumption with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, chipotle mayo and mustard relish. Unlimited fountain drink refills.  The vanilla milkshake hit the spot for my son,  the chicken fingers on the other have were a miss unfortunately.  Live and learn son live and learn.   Will frequent this place again."}
{"text":"FatBoy is an excellent culinary experience here in Vegas. It is located about 10 minutes east of Downtown, in a small strip mall. It's a pretty small restaurant, where you order at the counter for take out or dine in. They accept cash and card, and there are no credit card limits (praise Jesus!). The sitting area sits ~20 max, and it looks out to the parking lot and open kitchen. Nothing fancy, just a classic mom-and-pop burger joint arrangement.   I came in on a Saturday night about an hour before closing. There were about two other couple in there with me, so not busy at all. The cashier/\"waitress\" (she brought my food to me) was a friendly young woman who provided great service and was very attentive. Food was prepared and presented in a very timely manner; about 7-10 minutes after I ordered it. So they were obviously preparing it fresh, but still attentive to their customers.  The menu is where they really shine. It's American/Mexican/Pizza which doesn't sound like it works, but they made what I ordered excellently.  I got the Boyger combo, which came with a burger with all the fixings (shredded lettuce, tomato, chopped onion, relish, pickles, mustard, and a special mayonnaise), steak fries, and a drink. It reminded me a lot of FatBurger, but less greasy and more affordable. It was excellent, and I'm wildly tempted to get another one right now after writing about it. They have a standard soda fountain with Coke, Diet, Sprite, orange, lemonade, and the Dr. Pepper knock off. It wasn't too overwhelming with choices, but not as limiting as the Costco fountain. Also, their Coke is almost as good as In-N-Out's, which is very high praise in my book.  The one thing they could work on (but not enough to knock off a star) was clarity on their menu. The menu is this huge printed poster that takes up most of one of the walls. It lists all of the options and the prices, but lacks a bit in descriptions. For example, they have a burger combo listed on the menu, which I correctly assumed was a burger, fries, and drink. But they have both classic and steak fries, which I was unaware of because it's not listed on the menu. They also have a bunch of different burgers, like a Monster, Hawaiian, etc. But there is no description as to what is actually on theses burgers. You can obviously ask the cashier for more clarity, but having a more descriptive menu would prevent lots of hemming and hawing when ordering. Like I said, small, petty nuisance, that doesn't affect the rating, but annoying enough that it stuck with me.   Regardless of menu presentation, FatBoy is an excellent Vegas gem. The food is amazing, service is great, and ambiance quaint. They're expanding to a second location in Henderson, so definitely give them your business if you can't bring yourself to make the 20 minute trek to Downtown. But trust me, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, this place can make a burger! Fat Boy is located on the East side where I grew up. I can't believe I've never tried this place 'til now. I'd remembered Dyanna L's review of here and when my Dad wanted to go to lunch some place close to him I knew Fat Boy would be an excellent spot!   We went around 12:30pm on a Sunday and wow they were packed. We were very lucky to get one table for two that we quickly converted for three.   My husband and I both got the same thing, A Pastrami Boyger and their famous Chencho Fries. The burger was juicy and huge. It had a pile of pastrami and sautéed onions. What a great combo! When it came to the Chencho Fries we got them skinny, but for sure go with the fat fries next time. The fries were covered in a green chili sauce, little chunks of chicken, and jack cheese. All served with a fork. They were yummy. A very nice meld of flavors!   My Dad got the 16 piece Hot Wings. He loves hot things and these had his eyes watering a little. He was very happy and said they were quite tasty.   I love places like this. The only down side for me was that if you're eating in they have no public restroom. But that doesn't matter much because the food rocks! Forget chain burgers, Fat Boy is where you wanna be!"}
{"text":"2nd time around for my family & I.  This time we were lazy & grubhubbed Fatboy for dinner after an evening at the pool & it was just as good as the 1st time.  Our order was received & delivered way faster than the app had estimated.  Little one got her cheese boyger with bacon, and Dad and I both got pastrami boygers.  Little confusion on the burgers since my hubby gets his with everything, and i get mine minus a bunch of stuff.  They did both of them minus all the stuff.  Not the end of the world.  The pastrami boygers are good enough to stand on their own anyways lol :)  Little one and Dad split a large skinny chili cheese fries.  It was a huge portion;  and let me tell you she is a connoisseur of chili cheese fries, and she said Fatboy's are her favorite! I got fat fries with my combo they were good.   All in all they did good for the 2nd time around, and we'll keep going back.  We haven't tried the chencho fries yet, and the the burritos; those are next up."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we had a delicious lunch. Wonderful burgers and fries. Fresh and hot. Friendly service. A variety of foods on the menu. Good for those with heart appetites as they offer some family-sized deals.   Quesadillas, burgers, chicken fingers, salads, burritos.    And oh my gosh. How friendly. He remembered my name as he told me thanks after we dined. Love that!!  #makethisachain"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant in a sketchy neighborhood but the food was so worth it. Ordered a 14inch pepperoni pizza and a double cheese boyger. The pizza wasn't anything special but was a great value and came out freshly made. Hot! The burger was delicious. 2 thick patties of meat with 2 slices of cheese, Onions, tomato, and relish. For 7 bucks you can get a big delicious burger with steak fries and soda... this blows any fast food burger meal out of the water at the same price. One of the best burgers I have had. Place lived up to the hype. Just try not to get shot getting there."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: Clean, tidy & tiny, Mexican hole-in-the-wall burger place. Not too many peeps around to bug ya, also which is awesome!   SERVICE: Service was great! The employees were really helpful, since it was my first time eating there. Of course, they speak Spanish & English!! Caterin' to that hungry crowd!   FOOD: Boygers are awesome, I had the Hawaiian Boyger and Chencho fries, which were hot and delicious. They give you good portion sizes, and the prices are extremely, extremely cheap. They have a lot of specials, which are on the updated menu I attached!!   Love this place, can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Another hidden treasure on the east side! #yes (I know, hashtags are pointless on here). Anyway, my boyfriend and I shared chencho fries, 8 wings (1/2 bbq 1/2 hot), and a pastrami boyger. Between 2 people this can really fill you up!   Pastrami boyger: soooo so good. What I love most is you can taste the quality (no copyright infringement intended, in-n-out) because they use fresh foods & are made to order.   Chencho fries: pretty yummy. I would recommend an add on or two. Their options are bacon, ham, or egg. Pastrami would probably be bomb on there. I'm still pretty satisfied with it though.   Wings: I'm not crazy about their wings but I like that the hot sauce is actually hot & their bbq is pretty flavorful. At least you know there's no steroids in the chicken so that's always good.  Overall verdict: definitely worth the price & then some. One of the very few good food spots on east side Vegas :) Also! Bernie provided us the greatest customer service. So you're fortunate if he's working when you check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious food . The menu has a great variety of different foods but I come here for the chencho fries and pizza and they never disappoint! Staff is also friendly and welcoming. I will keep coming back for more"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for lunch and had a double cheeseburger with fries. Very good burger, cooked medium so still juicy, good size for the price and crispy fries. I would definitely come back for a burger. Sandwiches still need to be bigger though as I stated in my first review."}
{"text":"When I lived in California I was always a fan of the smaller burger joints. I rarely like to visit a chain restaurant to eat there. I had been on the hunt for a family owned, divey burger joint and this place would come up over and over in conversations with friends and family. I finally decided to venture into this place when I moved to the east side.   At first site, the establishment does not look that inviting because of the surrounding businesses. When you walk in, a very lovely pleasent aroma of hamburgers and pizza fills the air.You are greeted warmly by the staff everytime and if you come often enough, they remember your name and order. The menu has a good variety of burgers, hot sandwhiches and pizza. Also, they have the notoriously delicisous Chencho Fries! You get to choose from skinny fries or fat fries which really amazed me at the fact that I had a choice. They are covered with green chili and melted cheese which makes for a delicious flavor profile.   When someone asks for a recommendation for a good burger joint, people will usually say places like Bachi Burger or Gordon Ramsay's BRGR but THIS is my go to spot. There is nothing like a simple, undercomplicated burger!"}
{"text":"My kids and I stumbled upon this place as we searched through Yelp for a quick dinner. We LOVED that it was family run. The hamburgers  and skinny fries were excellent.  They have a lot of different choices that should appeal to the whole family. We look forward to returning to try their pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I have been coming in here for years and was so surprised by the owner today. I realizeed i forgot my wallet befor i ordered and he told me not to worry about it that he would hold the check till the next time i came in. If thats not customer service i don't know what is. The food here is always off the chain and with an owner like that he earned a customer for life. Also found out there is going to be another location coming soon at horizon Ridge and stephanie so go support this man and his awesome food."}
{"text":"I went to Fatboy last night. I ordered a cheeseburger combo and a strawberry milkshake. This is a awesome family run restaurant. I was able to meet the owners and his two sons. The burger was cooked perfect and it was excellent. I didn't think I could get a burger with that much taste for the price. The steak fries had the right amount of seasoning and the shake was a perfect extra for me. I will definitely be back and will recommend my neighbors and friends to come in for a bite."}
{"text":"I would go as far to say that this is THE best burger you will eat in it's price range $3-4! Would be one of the best under $10 for sure.  The burgers are fatty and juicy, just like they should be.  There is a nice crisp to the edges of the burger that add flavor and consistency...same with the bread.  It is most similar to In N Out, at least in comparison to other burger joints IMO.  They have a real home cooked taste. and it is very enjoyable.  Check out the pic :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fat-boy-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#9wpGkgWHLEg4sOX5uNnFaw  Ordered the chencho fries since everyone said to try them.  Sorry, didn't do much for me.  They come with chicken, cheese, and green chili on top of them, but the chicken is super tiny, and not grilled or anything, so they get lost in the sauce.  Grilling the chicken would add a nice consistency to the meat, but this is more like chicken in a can style.   I really like green chili, but I guess I don't really enjoy it on my french fries, and they got soggy pretty fast.  They weren't bad, but I wouldn't order them again.  Also, I asked for no lettuce/tom/onion on my burger, and they forgot about it.  Not a huge deal, but I haven't had an order wrong for quite some time.  And the neighborhood blows.  I won't hold it against them, but I doubt I will eat here after sundown LOL.   I will definitely be back when the sun is shining though!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is good and I love that is family owned. The owners and everyone that works there are friendly."}
{"text":"Good burger...Not great but good. Chencho Fries were amaaaaaaaazing!!!! I'd definetly go back...Owners were really friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a Fat Boy fan. The chencho fries are A-mazing. The atmosphere could be a little off putting but don't let that influence you to stop by. The burgers are definitely the best I have Had in Vegas by far. They are simple but take me back to my childhood.  I am a returning customer for sure."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for 23 years, and we finally have a great burger place! My wife had the turkey burger and enjoyed immensely. I had the pastrami burger which was excellent. The steak fries were cooked crispy, just the way I like them.  The service was excellent!  This will be my new go to place in the hood!"}
{"text":"Great food and the emp.s are great we enjoyed our visit. The breakfast sandwiches are great & price, for lunch we had the burgers good size great taste.  Don't forget  the onion rings. Thanks"}
{"text":"Went here on a craving for a great Philly Cheesesteak - not too many options in Las Vegas but Fat Boy does a pretty good job. I like my philly to have crispy bread and tender steak with onions and mushrooms and a lettuce/tomato mayo topper. The skinny fries were excellent, right seasoning and cooked to point. The milkshake was good but not great, could have been a bit more chocolatey. Although we only had Philly Cheesesteak this place was pretty good, service was very friendly but took a little while for our order. Overall solid 4/5"}
{"text":"Been here before and will go again. Its nice to have a good burger joint that you can feel like they remember you. My boyfriend always has a double monster burger that they have customized for him. Extra jalapenos make it spicy for him. And they always remember. Me? I am having fun trying the different burgers and sandwiches. The pastrami is to die for, the cheese boyger was excellent and the chenco fries will give you a heart attack but you will die with a smile on your face! Super casual atmosphere and people behind the counter who are always nice. I know why they get such great ratings, they have earned them. Just wish they had a bigger eating area and a restroom, no other changes needed!"}
{"text":"Although it may be a Bob's Big Boy burger knock off,  the food is worth the wait. The decor and available table space may be lacking but if you're looking for a great meal to take home at a decent price, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Good service, great pizza. Small joint, limited seating but worth the drive if you are staying in Vegas. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday mainly for my family. I for health reasons am on a strict vegetarian diet. They do have vegetarian options. My boyfriend and his daughter loved there sandwich and burger. I ordered the bean burrito and the Chinchilla fries. I didnt like either. But I was afraid to go with there vegetarian burger. Cause Ive had some that were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. Which is the case in most restaurants.  Also I am a very picky eater. My boyfriend and most of my family are chefs. So for us to give a good rating is a good thing. lol Anyways as I was leaving they gave me a vegetarian burger to try. I just ate it and I have to say that vegetarian burger was off the hook. I really should have ordered that and the regular fries. Anyways I am a fan now. That was the best vegetarian burger ive ever had. I will defiantly be back.:)"}
{"text":"Time after time delicious pizza, hamburgers, burritos, fries and much more. The staff is always friendly and efficient. Must try for yourself."}
{"text":"Oh Fat Boy... Where do I start? Let me just say, I love you... Everything about you. Whenever I see you I get this warm and fuzzy feeling. I know you can give me what I want, and lots of it. I love your smell. I love your taste. When you give me chencho fries and I gobble them up... Mmmm... So good. The crust of your pizzas is simply amazing. I came to see you just the other day. I wanted something a little... Weird and I was nervous to ask for it, but when I did, you served it right up with a smile on your face. CHENCHO FINGERS!!! Are you kidding me?!? Oh Fat Boy. You are what's good on the east side...  Seriously, this place is awesome and the guy who runs it is always super cool. The food is... It's just... It's delicious, plentiful and cheap! I couldn't ask for anything more!   The place is small, but it seems like a lot of their business is take it. Try it... You will fall in love!"}
{"text":"Well it's a good thing that Fat Boy is located across town from me. Otherwise, I'd be a regular and that could be very dangerous.   I don't know what's better, their burgers or the cheesesteak sandwiches? My husband and I usually get one of each and split them. Plus, you can't beat their prices and who doesn't love cheap eats?!?  Writing this review is making me hungry, so I might have to go clear across town for one of their juicy burgers. After I go to the gym, of course."}
{"text":"Fat Boy's hamburgers are really good. I thought he pizza was good too. I would recommend this family owned business."}
{"text":"Passed by this place several times. Looked up their menu and saw they have pastrami sandwich....yum! Finally decided to drop in for lunch.   Asked the difference between pastrami boyger and pastrami sandwich, pastrami boyger has a hamburger patty and pastrami. Too big for me so I Ordered pastrami sandwich with pickles but no mustard & skinny fries. They got order wrong and put in mustard. Ugh!! That's the reason for 4 stars. It was delicious otherwise and the skinny fries were tasty.   Hubby ordered Philly cheesesteak with fat fries. He loved it!  Yes, I would go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Was in Vegas for business, and needed a quick bit to eat, so I choose Fat Boy! It has amazing reviews, and by eating the food, I can tell why! The owners were also super friendly and helpful! Very highly recommend! When I visit Vegas again, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have more than hamburgers.  I have dietary restrictions, so I ordered a cheese burger for my husband, and a grilled chicken sandwich for myself.  Then I went to the wonderful cheese and wine store next door while I waited. Both sandwiches were very tasty, and it is far superior to any fast food restaurants close by.  Fast, inexpensive and really good food. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love yelp for this reason. I travel quite a nit with my husband. I'm  usually in charge of finding the restaurants.  I prefer to go to the local spots which usually has the best food at good prices. Fat Boy delivered! Real jalapeno cheeseburger with clench fries!!!! AMAZING! my hubby went for the double bacon cheeseburger....a monster of a burger! So yummy cheap fast and friendly service. I was mad that I was too full to order the chicken and bean boyrrito!"}
{"text":"So I was fiendin' for a burger,but I wanted something that tasted like those LA, off the street, momma& her uncle's kinda burger. The kind that taste totally different from a Red Robin burger and more than 3x the tastiness. I had myself a pastrami Boyger--super delish! I'm not a mayo fan,and even though I saw some of that gooey sauce Caucasian ppl go ape for, it was not a problem! The pastrami had a nice thin texture, but there was so much of it--I'm sure it made half the weight of my burger! AND OMJIZZLE GUYS!!ZUCCHINI STICKS!! they looked like little cheese sticks,so they were probably a little more processed than the ones you'd get at Farmer Boys,but their crunch and flavor was addicting! I'll go back for just those fersure! Alex grabbed a monster boyger, which was a typical burger,just more meat, but man oh man,I'm took a bite before I had a bite of my own burger and for a few seconds as I enjoyed that mouthwatering goodiness, I regretted my choice. Luckily, we live close by, because we WILL BE BAAAACK"}
{"text":"Burgers are good! Such a small place but big flavor. Green chile fries are the bomb cant find it no other place in vegas"}
{"text":"Today we felt like a good juicy burger and since it was during the week, which was a treat for myself and my husband, we decided to head over to Fat Boy for a good burger.    I ordered the double bacon with cheese, I know it sound like a lot, but I love burgers!  It was cooked medium well but remained very moist, with the juices running down my hand, in between my fingers as I took my first bite.  I love the addition of the tomato, pickles and shredded lettuce.    Of course my husband had the monster burger and had to order the Chencho fries.  The thick cut potato strips where cooked crispy, lightly golden, and then smothered in green chili, chicken, and cheese.  All melted and gooey.  It was a good addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and delicious food. Meals are priced appropriately for the food received, our kids love the options on the kids menu as well. We have been here a handful of times and have tried plenty of options on the menu from pizza to the boygers and Mexican food."}
{"text":"Today was a bad bad day for fatboy. I ordered the fatboyger meal 19.99. Received it ontime.  I opened the burger took a bite,,, meat was almost frozen cold buns were soggy like spit on it! I called to complain and asked if I could bring it back have them remake it. He was Rude and told me to get my refund back from grubhub.  I was on the phone with grubhub for over 20 minutes but they did refund me. That's not the point though. As a paying customer I don't care who the F*ck it is you need to treat people with respect. I finally told fat boy to basically F*ck off you will never hear from me again. Another one bites the dust. Hope you all lose your f*cking jobs too!!!!!"}
{"text":"With the location of Fat Boy pretty convenient to both my work and house, it makes it an easy stop to on my way home to pick up some food and have it piping hot when I get home. The menu is extensive with the focus on their burgers and the family that owns this spot are all some of the nicest people you'll come across.  Since everything is made to order, your wait is about 15 minutes before your food is ready. So your best bet is to call your order in or order online using the Eat 24 app for pick up. You'll find just about everything on their menu, which is good if others in your group aren't in the mood for burgers. With all the burgers priced in the single digits, you won't break the bank if you decide to feed your family here. Especially, if you choose one of their family specials, which are all around the $25 range and you get an insane amount of food.  The family members operating this business are always welcoming and willing to help you out if you have any questions. Although I haven't formally introduced myself to them, they do recognize me and thank me every time I come in. I haven't tried the pizza or the shakes yet, but the wings were on the small side which was expected for their price and the boyrrito was pretty standard, but not impressive enough to order again.   The buns and usual toppings for the burgers are OK, but I go without the chipotle mayo. The most important component for me is the beef and it is also satisfactory, but always overcooked to well done leaving the flavorful juices to sizzle away on the flat top. I've requested to have the burger cooked medium, but they said \"we'll try\" and when I took a bite, it was Mojave Desert dry. Fat or skinny, the fries aren't fresh cut, but are usually pretty good if they're not over seasoned.  You're guaranteed that nothing has been sitting around when you get your made to order food. And this local business is worth a try if you're in the area. The burgers aren't my favorite, but they're good enough for me that if I'm craving a burger, I'd rather keep my money in Henderson and support this hard working family instead of giving it to some actual fat boy who has never manned a grill in his life and is sitting with his feet propped up on his desk in some corporate office."}
{"text":"Hit up this spot BC if all the positive reviews on yelp so I had to c for myself... Got the double monster w bacon!! It was automatically a : ) .i did order a quesadilla and \"chenco fries\" no bueno on the fries.. Got cheese n green chiles but it seemed not to b a good mix.. Mayb just not for me...now the \"boyger\" was on point tho..def come back for one of them... Price is reasonable, atmosphere kinda burnt out but hey I'm not planning on moving in, just getn my burger n Rollin out...I give the boyger boys a thumbs up..."}
{"text":"The cheese was excellent. The meat would be too if they grilled it just a bit more. Worth the taste.  Great that they're friendly and accommodating as well."}
{"text":"Papi & I got 2 pastrami boygers & FF.  Homebmade burgers great flavor lean pastrami frilled onions pickles & chz.   We will definetly be back!!! Super friendly staff!!!  This Is not IN & OUT OR FIVE GUYS OR HAMBURGER HUT ...  IT'S BETTER!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today with the family. The place was small but very clean. We arrived when there weren't too many people there. We were greeted by the gentlemen who worked there who very friendly. They had a wide variety of items that range from \"boygers\" to pizza. Me and the family each had their boyger meal (I ihad the monster size which was recommended by Abel the cook.)Our food was made to order and it was worth the wait.  I have to say that the \"boygers\" here are the best I've had in a long time. Its a little ways away from my house but it was worth the drive. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place makes some seriously good food!! The staff is fantastic and the customer service is perfect!! Glade to see a family own restaurant down the street from me, the food is made with love! I wish them nothing but success!! I just wish they stayed open later for when I have mid night munchies."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have had UberEATS deliver and let me tell you...IT IS FANTASTIC! We ordered Boyrittos and they served the tortilla on the side to prevent it from being soggy. Such a wonderful idea!"}
{"text":"Great place i like the food i go there once or twice a week and think everybody should try the turkey burger"}
{"text":"I work in the same shopping center and when they first opened I had the fat fries & the chicken sandwich and chicken fingers. And it was super yummy! Then one day my boyfriend was like have you ever tried fat boy and I was like yeah I work right by it. And he was like it is sooooooo good. So we went for dinner and I had the Hawaiian boygur and I have to say so delicious. My new favorite!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch on a Saturday,  and were pleasantly surprised.  It's a no-frills burger and sandwich spot, with delicious food and fantastic prices. I had the bacon cheeseburger, and hubs got the pastrami burger. Yum! They have skinny fries and steak fries,  we preferred the latter.  It looks like this is a family run business,  and the service was friendly and fast. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and I'm so glad we did great food great service :)) we went with my son who is ten months and the lady in the back came and gave him rice and beans free of charge that was a special touch , we will be back later today lol"}
{"text":"We ordered burgers from here a week ago through Grub Hub and couldn't wait to order again!  These are by far the best burgers. They are hand made and so delicious. Juicy, full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  Next time I'll try to order something different, we'll see."}
{"text":"Freshest Burgers in town they hand press all of their patties every morning all of their food is delicious. The double cheeseburger and chicken burrito are the best, also must try the chencho fries yum yum"}
{"text":"Soooo.... This is my 2nd time eatting here TODAY.  Im having the Monster boyger combo with cheese and steak fries. If you are looking for a cali style homemade burger this is your place. The burger feels really light so they must use some light oil to cook it but it still fills you up. (im a big girl so i eats) i was stuffed yet didnt feel all heavy and tired. It was soooo good i am back 9 hours later lol. The menu is huggeeee. From pizza to burgers, burritos, chili cheese pastrami fries (good too, my hubby got them), sandwhiches wings.... My fat a** is in love. Btw the service is great!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in town. Close by great food and a friendly atmosphere!!! Double Monster Boyger for me!!! Yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"We went out on a limb and tried Fat Boys.  It's a very small and quaint restaurant with no bathrooms. It's clean and Ivan the son is super nice.  Since it was our first time Ivan went over the menu with us.  Many wonderful choices, everything sounded great.   We ordered our drinks and food and although he miss the burrito which was the first item I ordered. He realized he missed it and had it made pretty quickly.  All the food was fantastic.    I have to say they were some of the nicest people and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I can't really give this place 5 stars. After waiting an hour and asking the cashier where our food was, they specified the gave our order to a different costumer. Just made the whole experience bad. I don't know if I will be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"We drop by here about once per month.  The Guys Like The BOYGERS  With Fat Frys AND I Love the pastrami  Sandwich With Mustard AND Pickles AND Of Course The Fat frys.  Nice cheap on y he go meal."}
{"text":"This isn't lavish, but so isn't the name. This is great, American favorites done in a classic way that should please any flavor pallet. We have the philly cheese, and the guacamole boyger, both of which were wonder. The Latin family that owns the joint also include some Mexican entrees that are done right. It is a nice little find for someone who wants great tasting, inexpensive food."}
{"text":"YUM!!!! My BF and I were in the area and hungry. We were going to be stopping in a nearby business and I recommended that we eat here. We definitely did not regret it!!  This is defnitely a casual place - it looks similar to a taco shop, but with way more choices! I had the philly steak sandwich and my man had the monster cheese boyger. He said it was one of the best burgers he's had in Vegas - I tasted it and it was really delicious. My sandwich was also really good and I loved the fat fries.  Everything is made fresh to order and never frozen. The lady working th register was awesome and gave us some of her favorite items as suggestions, since it was our first time. My BF has been talking about this place ever since and we can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Came in from Cali and found this spot on yelp and had to see what it was about.... None the less sooooo amazing loved everything the burger and wings yum!!! And seasoned steak fries."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and got a burger fries and a coke. Thought it was gunna be great from all the hype but after I tried it. The burger was okay. Not great iv had better. And the fries were tossed in ALOT of seasoning!!!!! I mean that's all I tasted. The reason they get 2 stars is because the coke. I mean they couldn't mess that up right? Maybe I just got a bad order? Idk.  All in all I don't think I will go back and won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great burger!! If you are a burgerholic like me this is a good one..check it!! Meat is cooked fast and hot that leaves crisp's around the meat but still so jucy...I know burgers and this is a good one.."}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday for lunch. Staff was super nice.  Had skinny chencho fries and they were really good.  Imagine McDonald's fries covered in warm salsa verde and gooey melted cheese.  They got soggy real fast but I scarfed em' down so quick it didn't matter.  Also got a small cheese pizza which was aight I guess....it was real soft.  And husband got an Avocado cheese burger which I took a bite of and I liked it a lot.  Minus one star cuz' I had Montezuma's revenge later that day.  TMI?"}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place for years. Finally decided to give it a try since the reviews were so good. Now I'm kicking myself for just driving by all those years, the food here is awesome. No more driving across town to Sammy's for pastrami. This place is better, cheaper and closer to home."}
{"text":"Just ordered it for the second time love the veggie burger here so good! My husband loves the monster cheese boyger! We both love the onion rings and fries!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint I've had in Vegas (which is, admittedly, few), but it stands up to the best in LA.  The fare is effectively a riff on Fatburger, but they've done a much better job and introduced a Mexican food twist to the cuisine if you desire.  Not only can you get one of the best and most affordable burgers in Vegas, but you can get a take out pizza for $6.  Unheard of."}
{"text":"Me and my friends were all a little hungover and looking for some greasy food to help. Saw some good ratings for FatBoy so that's where we went as it was pretty close.  It's your typical in a strip mall place. Maybe 4 tables so take out is what they specialize in. They have a nice selection of burgers, pizza, and some mexican food.   We ordered two guacamole boygers, and 2 cheesesteak sandwiches. I added a strawberry milkshake for $2.99 (good price).   The boygers were ok. The meat is freshly pressed, but not seasoned much. Unfortunately, the cheesesteaks were not good. Small, little flavor, not much cheese. I would not order these again here. Very disappointing.  A very nice lady took our order, and the place is very clean. They weren't doing pizza yet at noon. Prices are very good and fair. You will probably find some items great here. Just not the cheesesteaks.   I'd return, but order something different."}
{"text":"Delicious food, awesome service, and Mr. Pibb...what more could you want?!?!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The chencho fries will blow your mind. This should be at the top of the reviews for the best fast food burgers in Las Vegas. In McDonald, Car JR, Jack the Box, etc, has nothing on this place. The shakes are real and delicious. The burgers are pure beef. Will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"It was almost exactly as you'd imagine. Fries were fresh and cheesesteak was above average. I'd go back but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza around 6:30pm, it said itd be here by 7:40-8 It wasn't ready until 8:15, and I didn't actually receive the Pizza until 9:30. Over an hour after it was ready.  Yes, she confirmed with me the pizza was ready by 8:15 and they didn't actually deliver the pizza until around 9:15 I called multiple times to check the order and each time was a different story. The woman I spoke to was Mary I believe, and confirmed my pizza was in and out of the oven from 8:15-9 before they delivered it to me. I've worked in a pizzeria and that's not how my company handled these delays. A \"warm\" pizza is not a fresh pizza  And believe me it was not warm Neither were the wings. Sad."}
{"text":"What fabulous, cheap and delicious food!  Everyone in my party ordered hamburgers with fries, 2 of us had the cheeseburgers, 1 a hamburger and 1 guac burger.  Everyone said the food was great.  My cheeseburger which came with a drink and fries, for a cheap total of $7.00, was fabulous!  Fries were steak fries and delish, the cheeseburger met all my needs, juicy but not too juicy, quality beef, comes with a good slice of tomato, lettuce, mayo and a pickle slice, plus I had grilled onions for free changed from raw onions, and I added mustard.  The menu has burritos, pizzas, and different types of burgers.  They have more than one location in the valley, if this one doesn't work for you.    This is a must-go for us locals, and  tourists with a car!!"}
{"text":"Great chili burger.....hamburger it delicious......we really enjoyed there little place....we will definitely be going back soon"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and it was great. The burger was excellent and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"One of the rare, family owned restaurants in Henderson area. They have a wonderful selection menu and I tried their teriyaki burger. Perfect portion and fries, the bread is like brioche style buns which is lightly toasted and soft inside. Service is fast with a delightful customer service from the owner himself. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fond by chance !!! Off horizon ridge in a strip mall ! Fantastic pastrami burger and steak fries and onion rings. Chocolate shake was made with scoop blended was the final touch. Definitely must try their pizza table next to us has wings they say me yelping and have me one. Supper delicious!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a photo of a dripping Cheese Boyger, I was eager to try the food at this little eatery.  I took along Diane, another male friend who is always game to try a new top burger, and his burger-loving wife.  Even though the establishment wouldn't make any burgers medium rare, all of us were very satisfied with our burgers.  My Cheese Boyger with everything featured a quarter-pound beef patty prepared medium well, cool pickles, lettuce, a large slice of fresh tomato, relish, mustard, chipotle mayonnaise, and melted American Cheese on a soft bun, and I added some available Heinz Tomato Ketchup.  There was little American Cheese inside but the burger was still quite tasty.    I also enjoyed Chencho Fat Fries that contained chopped chicken, Green Sauce, and melted Mozzarella Cheese spread over the fries.  I noted that the soft fries themselves absorbed some liquid from the other ingredients.  But I was really most impressed with my Wet Boyrrito with Beef, Red Sauce & Beans on the inside, and Mozzarella Cheese and Green Sauce on the outside.  This was one of the best burritos I have had outside of Southern California.  The Green Sauce was real good and zesty but not too spicy, small cubes of steak inside had a grilled flavor, the beans were small and tasty, and some of the Mozzarella Cheese melted nicely on top of the fairly large burrito.  I will likely come back for this.  So, while the Cheese Boyger and Chencho Fries did not blow me away, the Wet Boyrrito was a nice surprise.  And, I liked that the friendly cooks were willing to prepare a Boyrrito just as a diner would like it (e.g., with or without rice, beans, beef, or chicken, and with Red Sauce, Green Sauce, or no sauce).  The place is a small and unassuming storefront situated in the middle of a strip mall.  But it is comfortable enough, and free refills are allowed for fountain soft drinks.  Above all, the freshly prepared food is excellent, which should count the most.    I, too, am now a fan!  4-1/2 Stars!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended. My husband got a Philly cheesesteak and chenco fries. The fries were great with little chunks of chicken and green chile...yum! We will be to try something new soon!"}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean, with a hella of a burger for great price. If your looking for a home style burger at the right price you've found it!!"}
{"text":"Another little place with big flavor. The burgers are big and the fries are crispy. A pile of pastrami comes on the pastrami  burger . We will definitely be back here for more."}
{"text":"Our first time here and definitely coming back. Hubby had the Hawaiian boyger  and he devoured it. I had the wet beef boyrito and the red sauce was delicious. Not too spicy but had a good kick. Don't forget the chancho fries, those were out of this world!! Prices were good and portions were big."}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out and ended up waiting about 30 minutes on some wings, 2 burgers and Chencho Fries. I found out that this wasn't a good idea. Their food is not as tasty if it's not fresh. I wish they would have used nacho cheese vs string cheese on the Chencho fries. It dried up as one big piece of cheese on top. With all that being said, I didn't have the best experience this day but maybe next time I'll just try the pizza, a FRESH one!"}
{"text":"The place is a little off putting but do not let that stop you! 6 tables inside is clearly not enough for a place with such great food. It was about $7 or $8 for a medium pizza (8 slices) and man was it delicious. Not the best pizza I've ever had but it goes to say it's the best I've had in Vegas so far. $11 lunch date for two is just a price you can't beat. Would highly recommend this place. The only complaint I had was actually a silly one: the napkins! Come on guys, invest in some real ones and not a package from the 99 cent store . I did love how I was brought a shaker of Parmesan cheese fresh from the cooler though! I absolutely appreciated such a minor effort because it makes a big difference to me."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the high reviews. It's a shame when you go somewhere with high expectations and you're let down.   We tried their one item carryout pizza special for $5.45, let me tell you, you get what you pay for. The pepperoni and cheese were so skimpy and non-existant. I ended up scraping the toppings onto TWO slices, the rest of the pizza/ scraped off dough were thrown out.  Fortunately, or so I thought I still had a BLT, the bacon consisted of little bits here and there. What happened to the fresh bacon? The long slices of bacon? Or plenty of bacon? They weren't in my sandwich, that's for sure.  Checho fries, yeah we got an order. $2.99 for a little to go box doesn't seem worth it. When I was there I saw a basket being delivered to the table next to me, I thought that was more like it, so unless you're eating at the restaurant pass on the Checho fries.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"My family Loves FatBoy.... pastrami boyger is awesome with a side of skinny fries... there's not a burger here that isn't delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here and was very impressed with the local atmosphere of the place. This is the type of place we need to support more and more!   Had the pastrami sandwich and also the special fries everyone seems to talk about. Really enjoyed flavor of the fries, one downer was didn't seem like there were enough, even though what there was was quite tasty.   What caused this review to lose one star was the pastrami sandwich I had. It was a better than average and quite tasty. It was a little too fatty for my tastes. If they upped the flavor a little and got slightly better cut of meat then I'd go gaga overt it.   Might be back here, not sure. Was pricey for value and my taste buds were pleased, but not ecstatic. Left a little less than full but satisfied."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries!  Fast & friendly service- but took a star off for accuracy - even after the cashier repeated it back- and atmosphere/ambiance was pretty lame.   The window is empty and it is hard to see the open sign from the road. Dining area is bland with chipped yellow walls that are sparely covered in food posters. They could use some decor and a theme. Please for the love of god turn off the easy listening radio station made me feel I was eating at a nursing home or my dentist! Because of this most of these items it seems the patrons don't eat in the store or eat with ear buds in.   The menu is strange with Pizza, burgers and TexMex but not really offering the entire options for the cuisine. We really enjoyed our burgers but we had to ask a bunch of questions prior to ordering - the regular burger is 1/4 lb, the monster is 1/2lb and each has a double option, with and without cheese.    To the owner- if you read this - it is highly recommend adding a blue cheese bacon burger and a bacon BBQ burger to the menu as these items are expected for a burger place. Give better descriptions on the menu for size of burgers and what cheese, toppings and sauce can be added. As you are in Henderson you also really should Highlight all items can be made protein style (lettuce wrap) w/ a side salad - healthy choices here!!!! Also - cheddar cheese is a standard for a burger joint.   We'll be back as the food was pretty darn good at the right price."}
