{"text":"This place is a new go-to lunch spot for myself and coworkers. It's fast with counter-style seating, the tacos are more traditional (think Las Palmas, less like Smoke) and well constructed, and the pricing is reasonable at three bucks a taco.   Friendly staff, good food, great price - what's not to like?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a 3 dollar taco that tastes like a million bucks... then look no further! Made fresh and to your specifications, these are the best and freshest tacos you'll ever put in your mouth. And from what I understand a good majority (if not all) of the ingredients are locally sourced! Now what's not to like about THAT. The black beans are great. Come with fresh cilantro sprig, spicy crema and pico. Don't get me started on the smoked lamb tacos. THEY ARE LIFE CHANGING! Any taco can be made as a bowl and vice versa. They even have walking tacos. you pick the chip, meat and toppings and you're out the door. They keep it real at Doce Taqueria. Real fresh. Real simple. Real quick. No rice. And guac isn't extra....because there isn't any. The place itself is tiny but cozy. The artwork is simple, colorful and eye-catching. It looks exactly how you'd expect it to look. And parking really isn't a problem like I thought it would be. Everyone who works there is great. Friendly. Helpful. Accommodating. Doce has been a blessing for me and many of my taco wackos. Easy to get to. Open late. Always clean. Decent parking. AAAHMAZING food. Great staff. Crazy affordable. Everyday should be Taco Tuesday. ESPECIALLY when there's smoked lamb on the menu for the day!!!"}
{"text":"I recently went Doce Taqueria for take out. The tacos were good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with a friend on the way back from a hike. I was initially worked about the limited menus selection. I ordered a chicken and a carnitas taco. They were both well made, with the appropriate amount of filling, and a pretty good flavor profile. My friend got a carnitas and the daily special which he also enjoyed. This is a pretty solid choice for a satisfying quick bite."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and nachos! Stopped here for lunch with my dad and siblings after getting tired of Mercy Hospital Cafeteria food and it was a great choice. Definitely worth a trip. Fast, fresh and decently priced food. Public parking lot directly across the street. The two guys behind the counter were friendly and I was happy there were vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Best tacos in pittsburgh for sure.  One of my fav places  after a night of drinking... or to go to the boat!"}
{"text":"Great addition to South Side.  Just damn good tacos.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a handful of times and have had excellent service each time with the exception of once.  Week night, small crowd, older waitress who I never saw working there is out front talking with people, sees me walk in, and proceeds to chat until a bigger group of people stroll in. Doesn't acknowledge me, takes their orders first, so I left. Ehh, whatever (maybe I should've spoken up).  Came back a few days later for the awesome cinco de mayo special and everything was back to normal. Keep up the good work guys (just try to pay attention when customers come in).  Probably the best tacos in the burgh if you're looking for a quick bite. Wish they served alcohol and had seating to accommodate more people but then again, they're surrounded by bars so I can appreciate the dedication to serving up some great grub.  Again, keep grinding... I see a lot of potential to expand and prosper.  Update: The service and food here continues to be excellent. When asked where to grab a great taco in the city, I always point friends and familiy toward Doce. Five stars."}
{"text":"I stopped here after visiting Dave's Music Mine a couple doors away and they highly recommended it. Man was this place good. It reminds me of the kind of taqueria you would find in southern texas.  I had the pork tacos and chose flour tortillas.  $3 each and well worth it. My daughter had the vegetarian black bean tacos and loved them.  We will be back to try the nachos next time."}
{"text":"Really great tacos and probably the best in the Southside. Carnitas tacos are excellent and they have a special that changes daily. There's a lot on the menu including nachos and walking tacos are well as a taco bowl. I have only had tacos to go but the service has always been fast with tacos made right in front of you."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on Sunday afternoon and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It's a small place with about 13 seats (all at a bar) and a few taco options. I ordered two carnita tacos on flour tortillas but you get the choice of flour or corn tortillas for every taco. The meat was flavorful and well seasoned, the Mexican slaw and fresh pico was also a nice touch. It was garnished with farmers cheese and some cilantro and it was delicious. To make my experience even better, my two tacos were only $6!!! It was an awesome place, with awesome staff, and most importantly awesome food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"best damn tacos in the burgh!!!   if you are alive and breathing you need to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I think Doce has dethroned Las Palmas as my favorite taco place in the city. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I wish I would have tried it earlier!  The quality for the value is excellent.    There is no booze and seating is limited so be prepared.  They write your order on a post it note and it's made right behind the bar.    I love the beef nachos.  I might be addicted. The chicken tacos are great too.    As much as I hope this place is very successful, I hope the word doesn't get out.  Right now the small space seems to work well for the volume of customers. The"}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Not a lot of seating so not for large groups. The guy behind the counter, I wish I caught his name, was great!  He moved quick and took orders quickly he did not slow for a second till everyone was take care off.  The food was fantastic!  3 delicious tacos and a drink for 11 dollars!  It was a cheap and fun date night for us.   I suggest walking down to the milk shake factory after for chocolate. It really topped the night off right for us!"}
{"text":"This place is my shit. Midday is the best time to go and every time I do, its fresh and tastes awesome. The staff is friendly and works quickly. They have a simple menu and they allow for edits and substitutions to your order which is nice. One suggestion would be to add a fish taco as a possible choice. Its almost perfect. Minus one star because the only drinks they have are bottled in a mini fridge which is a lot more annoying than you'd think when trying to have an inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"The tacos here are TO DIE FOR!!  I had a chicken taco and a pulled pork taco.  The flavoring is outstanding!  A MUST VISIT!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great service, and clean. Very good tacos, excellent hot sauce, reasonable prices. Would definitely come back. The only thing that would have made experience better would be fountain drinks instead of bottles."}
{"text":"Really tasty tacos at a reasonable price ($3/taco) They aren't trying to be the ultra gourmet tacos like at smoke, but this place is much more like a proper taco shop you'd find in Texas and California.   The Vegan Tacos can be made vegetarian with added cheese and the loaded nachos were delicious. Lots of hot sauce options at there counter make for a satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Great fresh tacos, can eat in or pick up. Pretty tiny inside with limited seating, but it works for the location. Good prices and great fresh food and ingredients. Try a different taco everytime I go back."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Doce. Writing my first review on Yelp here because this place deserves some respect. I first came across Doce last year after moving to Pittsburgh in search of some late night food (previously the best hot dog place in Pittsburgh, now the best late-night taco place), haven't been disappointed since. Great prices, cool vibes, and some interesting people that work here.  The hole-in-the-wall mentality perfectly fits. Glad to see that they are continually growing in popularity. I annoy my co-workers and friends all the time in bragging about Doce, and I will continue to support this local business.  See you at doce."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! I'm in Pittsburgh for a week and I've been twice already. I'll probably go again before I leave. Small quirky place with limited seating, but delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican \"street\" food and a good price!    $14 for three flavorful tacos and nachos with chicken, yes please! We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Food and staff are great! Also they always have great music playing here. I live pretty close so I eat hear once a week. If you haven't been here definitely check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So grateful for this place. Pittsburgh desperately needed a quick and amazing taco plac like this. Pork tacos are unbelievable and so worth the price. Docs, please never leave!!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best tacos I've had in PGH!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Mexican spots in the city. Quick fast service guarantee"}
{"text":"The Tacos are out of this world!  I love the nachos as well.  Great staff, fun enviroment, great prices."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place!! Great atmosphere, great food, great service! Never have I had a bad experience going here, and would highly recommend checking it out if you get the hankering for the best tacos in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend the chicken tacos, they're to die for"}
{"text":"The food is decent.... Some would say some of the best inthe city, cool.  The place can get busy and its not overly clear if you should sit and hope to order or stand at the far end to order and then sit (if available).  My concern is with the sanitary practices at the establishment. Today, my second visit, the lady with the 3/4 tattoo sleeve that was working/taking orders dropped the top of the squeeze bottle for the sour cream/sauce in the trash as she was switching bottles and just picked it out and put it right back on top of the squeeze bottle. Said sour cream/sauce bottle was then used to dress every order there after.  Foul. There is a 3 bowl sink right to her left not sure why it wasnt washed and sanitized then put back on the bottle. Another customer noticed as well and clearly was grossed out as she mentioned it to her friend. The same lady also removes customers trash from the bar, which is great, but she also was putting tortillas on the grill with no gloves, and munching on chips.  However, the guy that was working the food station seemed to have all his safe serve requirments together.  On a side note, they also never informed customers that they were out of avocado for the pollo tacos and when multiple customers asked they just said \"we are out\".  Shouldnt you let the customer know ahead of time?  I was impressed that they compe'ed the food of a police officer that came in for lunch.  So all in all  sanitation and customer service could be better.  If you are ok with those two being out of whack of sorts the food is decent."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! Have decent vegan option which was the saviour for my friend. I totally enjoyed the chicken option. We ordered Nacho's on the side which were also very very good. Overall a very good Mexican place to eat especially since it's open late night also."}
{"text":"Excellent, amazing, wonderful and any other adjective you can use to describe greatness.. been there tons of times and it's always the same. Great tacos!! The chef is talkative, the atmosphere is upbeat and best tacos in Pittsburgh.. thank you Doce Tagueria!!"}
{"text":"Best pork taco I've ever had, and the ground beef wasn't far behind. Tough-to-top tolls for tasty tacos. Terrific."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. My boyfriend and I tried all of the tacos except the vegan one, including the special bbq taco, and I thought they were all fantastic. The only criticism is that the corn tortillas were a little crumbly, so my boyfriend's tacos fell apart. Only $3 each, cute place, friendly staff. definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The greatest taco store on earth: Super quick and totally fresh. This place is absolutely awesome whether it's dinner at the bar, take out or late night food (they're open after the bars close on the weekend). Don't let lines deter you- if it's crowded the extremely friendly staff works super hard to get everything out quickly and accurately! As a vegetarian, I personally love getting the vegan tacos and adding queso fresco on top. Two is the perfect amount for a meal and one is a great snack. And they come out looking totally instagrammable ;) The only things this place needs to add are margs and cerveza!"}
{"text":"We randomly came to this place with the intent of having couple of tacos but we ended up having an early dinner here since the tacos were so tasty. The place is pretty small so come here early to ensure that you don't have to wait too long!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh! The flavors are perfect. I wish they had a liquor license and a bigger spot."}
{"text":"I had the chicken taco and the vegan taco on corn tortillas. So good! The chicken taco was my favorite. It's a very small space and no BYOB but the food was great and the guys working there were super friendly. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I stopped here before hitting a show and absolutely loved it. It's a no frills type of place, but you would never know that based on the quality of the food. The veggie and pollo tacos were delicious. It was so good, that I came back after my show so I could enjoy the nachos. They don't sell liquor or beer here, but you are allowed to take it to-go and enjoy it at the bar next door (same owners). Every bite had amazing flavor ... both the tacos and the nachos. I will definitely return very soon. It's a small little place but their concept is very thought out. I even enjoyed the fact that every item is priced as a whole dollar amount (Tacos $3, Nachos $4 no meat / $5 with meat, soda $2, beans $2). Our server was friendly and personable."}
{"text":"The tacos are good, but their meats can be dry. Hit or miss.  They have smaller, conventional menu (chicken, steak, pork, veggie?) items for their tacos. While the service was fast and error-free, they are not the friendliest people."}
{"text":"Awesome taco shack. Just what a taco shack should look like, smell like, and feel like. Small counter to sit at and down a few tasty tacos. Flavor of the day changes frequently and it's always a great mix up of flavors. All the house tacos are fire and fresh. Only wish there was a beach outside the door instead of Carson."}
{"text":"Really paying for quality over quantity. They raised the price from 250 to 3.00 per taco."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in Pittsburgh. Cozy little place, great vibe. The girls who work here are beautiful, and most important so down to earth and friendly. I avoid it on weekend nights Bc of the drunk college crowd. Try the carnitas!"}
{"text":"Best taco's I've had in in pittsburgh (so far, anyways). Better than the extremely overrated and overpriced tako. Better than la palapa (way cooler vibe, as well). Even better than Las Palmas imo (although it's close). They are friendly, the decor is awesome, there are tons of rare pops, they take cards, food is super cheap and extremely tasty. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, and loved everything about it! This place is pretty small so you may want or have to get your tacos to go, but it's absolutely worth it! I ordered the chicken and carnitas tacos and paid only $6. The menu is super simple which I like, because it makes the decision process much easier. Plus, I'd rather eat at a place that offers few, but high quality items as opposed to a plethora of mediocre items. The fresh ingredients are right there behind the counter as you can watch your meal being prepared. Personally, I found the chicken to have to more flavor so next time I'll go with that. I saw someone else's order of loaded nachos and for about five bucks, they looked hearty and tasty. I'll definitely bring friends back to this place for more good eats. Also, they have vegan and vegetarian options available.!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Tacos!  After hearing my wife rave about their tacos and nachos for months I had to see what all the hype was about for myself. The inside is fairly small which is a shame as in order to really enjoy their tacos you need to eat them freshly made. Maybe ten seats wrapped around the cooking area and maybe another three or four seats at the window. Lucky for us, the evening we went the place was almost completely empty at the time we arrived but filled up quickly after.  As far as their taco choices go they offer about six different tacos. Carnitas (pork), Pollo (chicken), two types of ground beef tacos (Carne Molida and Americano), a Vegan taco and a Special Daily Taco Special each for $3 each served on either a flour or corn tortilla.   On my first visit I went with a Carnitas, Pollo and Carne Molida taco. The Carnitas taco features slow smoked pork, Mexican Slaw, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Pollo taco features marinated chopped chicken, Avocado, Cholula Crema, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Carne Molida taco features Spicy Ground Beef, Bell Peppers, Jalapenos, Cholula Crema, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. Of the three the Carnitas was my favorite by far! The perfectly cooked pulled pork was so flavorful. It was melt in your mouth tender. The Pollo taco was a close second as the marinated chicken was very flavorful as well. The Carne Molida taco was good but not as much of a stand out as the other two.  On my second visit I had the Carnitas Nachos which for $5 is a stellar bargain as I was completely stuffed after I finished them. Some of the best nachos I have had in a long, long time.   I usually don't frequent The South Side or Carson Street very often, but Doce Taqueria will be changing that for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos on the go! One of the best tacos I've ever had. Unfortunately I was warned before eating here about the rude staff... They were right. The food was as good as the staff was rude. Very rude for no reason! \"Excuse me, DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT YET!?\" - I'm sorry but I've never been here before and was reading the menu. Ps- there were only two people behind us"}
{"text":"My favorite taco stop.   Flower or corn tacos,  nachos and a veggie bowl.  That's it!   Yummy!"}
{"text":"Here are my thoughts on Doce: https://eatsbysne.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/i-say-doce-you-say-taqueria/"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Stumbled in here after some adult beverages and it just hit the spot. Small menu makes things less complicating and prices are middle of the road. Everything was well seasoned and fresh. I smashed 3 tacos and was absolutely stuffed. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for tacos, but you're indecisive (like me), this is a good place for you since the menu is quite small. The menu isn't the only thing that's small here, the dining space is also tiny; I estimate it to seat about 13 people, give or take?  From selecting a few items from the menu, it seemed to me that the toppings for each taco were rather similar, except for their American taco. My carnitas, spicy beef, and nachos were all topped with cilantro and Mexican farmer's cheese, making them look the same. Taste, however, wasn't identical between the three items, but still quite similar. My favorite was the carnitas: very tender and flavorful pork topped with fresh ingredients. What's not to like? The small price tag also makes these tacos even better. At only $3 a taco, you could try one of each without breaking the bank.   Overall, great place to quickly grab some tacos. The service is friendly and super fast. Another perk: they're even open late on weekends!"}
{"text":"The BEST late night eats in Pittsburgh. They're open late on the weekends, so it's the perfect place to eat, or get food to-go after a long night in the South Side. I always spring for the nachos with pulled chicken - they're only $5 (what?!) and GUAC ISN'T EXTRA! Seriously, this place is unreal. Usually a long line out the door, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Doce always a great spot. 3$ tacos and a rotating special tacos. Love this place writing this review makes me hungry just thinking about them tastie tacos.  Best tacos you'll ever eat out!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had.  Mmm.  Me and a friend stopped in for lunch and we had ordered and received our food in about 5 minutes.  We split nachos (I didn't get meat on them, looking back I wish I would have) and we each got 3 tacos.  You get to choose corn or flour tortillas and they have beef, pork, chicken, and veggie options.  Tacos were $3 each.    Service was friendly and the small store is my kinda vibe.  I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Okay so let me start by saying DELICIOUS! I got the vegan option with avocado. Seriously so yummy. I could eat probably 5 more easily. I'm glad they had corn tortilla's as an option too. Also a nice selection of hot sauce's and very cool decor! Sugar skulls on the walls and bright colors! Staff was super friendly! I recommend coming here for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I am from Texas and of Hispanic decent so, I am very familiar with good quality Mexican food, I am not an expert but I can tell good from ehhh not so good. When I decided to give this taqueria a try I wasn't expecting much but after meeting the staff and deciding what to order (Chicken tacos) man was I impressed the flavor, quality and presentation is top notch. This place is very inviting and staff are friendly willing to help and offer some tips on what to order. This place kinda reminds me of the small grab n go style of restaurants you would typically find in downtown districts in many cities across Mexico. Long story short is that I Highly Recommend this place five stars from me. FYI I am not from Pittsburgh but when I am town I make it a point of my stay to visit this place. Pittsburgh you have great place to grab some awesome tacos, go out and support this establishment they are serving great food."}
{"text":"Tacos were pretty good. The pork was the best on I tried. Black beans were a good for the price. A full meal here will run close to $10 and they don't offer tap water to drink, only drinks from their cooler which is a bit annoying. Decent Tex max of on the southside but I probably won't make another trip out of my way."}
{"text":"Great tacos... or was I influenced by that 2 am feeling? Carnitas are the best, the American are meh..."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Quick, delicious, and cheap - excellent all around!  My favorite is the Americano."}
{"text":"I had a poor time, I recently went to get vegan tacos. The woman at the register told me there was not beans. That seemed odd to me for a taco place but I still said I wanted them, she then seemed reluctant,  talking me out of the tacos, but not really working with me to find another option. I just left, didn't try the food, the wait was pretty long, although there was no line, there was one employee doing everything. Preparing, taking orders, the girl seemed overwhelmed and therefore kind of rude.The ambiance was cool though."}
{"text":"This place is quite small, and I didn't expect much coming in. But the food tho... OMG... so good! I ordered the dino bowl and my friend ordered a taco. He finished it in 4 min and bought another one   If you are in town, you should definitely come here and try their Devine Tacossssss"}
{"text":"The gem of Southside! Food truck experience inside a tiny restaurant. The menu and ingredients are very simple, but everything is so good. My favorites are the chicken taco and their salsa. This is my new go-to lunch break spot. The service is super quick."}
{"text":"$3 even for any taco on the menu, including specials.  I enjoyed the chicken and carnitas! Fast service, laidback, sit at counter facing street windows and watch the people go by... would be great place to duck into on a cold night after a show.  Open until 3:00am on fri/sat."}
{"text":"overall extremely good quality tacos never disappointed and always great music on every time I come in! Cool hip joint and cheap!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Chicken and carnitas are my favorite, they both come with a slaw that adds the perfect crunch. The tacos are always 3 dollars and taste great every time!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend who talked wonders about this place. In all honesty- sure, we were one of the last people there, but damn, that lack of customer service!   We order our tacos on corn tortillas, because that's how the Lord intended tacos to be. Well, guess which ones we received? Not only the disgrace of actually receiving a flour tortilla, but their bathroom was \"unavailable\"? At least have some hand sanitizer at hand if your spot, which serves TACOS, which you happen to eat with YOUR HANDS, has a \"busted bathroom\". Also, be kind enough to at least saying when your bathroom is down where to find an alternative.  Tacos were meh (but this is me comparing to tacos from out of town) and their selection of hot sauces mediocre. Felt like I was in a Chipotle.  Two stars are for decoration.  Obviously now him and I are not friends any longer. Whoever brings you here for tacos doesn't appreciate you and you shouldn't have them in your life."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I'm a huge sucker for anything in a corn tortilla and these tacos definitely hit the spot.  I had the daily special which was a BBQ chicken taco, the carnitas, and the carne molida. My favorite was the special, then the carne molida. Carnitas had a great texture and toppings but I thought the meat itself could have used a little more flavor. The only other thing I would have changed is I prefer fresh jalapeño over pickled, but that's super minor.   The price is right on these tacos for sure! Though I got them to go, the place is very cool inside and the staff is friendly. All in all, I ordered, watched my tacos be prepared, and was on my way in less than 10 minutes! I'm glad I don't live closer because it could be dangerous!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm really mad that I haven't come here sooner! Delicious, quick, and cheap--tacos done right!! Came here on a whim on a Monday night and even then it was pretty packed (granted this place is about the size of my thumb). This place is basically a taco truck but inside a small building. The menu is simple, a few types of tacos, some nacho options, and bottled drinks. I love that you have the option of flour or corn tortillas. The chicken taco has an amazing smoky flavor. Oh, and not only are the delicious, they are cheap!! $3 a taco. Can't beat that. Love the interior decor and I'm a sucker for neon signs lol"}
{"text":"YES!!! YES!!! I LOVE DOCE!!! Is there anything else I need to say?! I've been here a couple of times... some nights for dinner & some nights after a night in the SS at 2AM. Any time, this place is simply amazing.   My boyfriend & I love tacos and we both agree that these are some of the best we've ever had. Be prepared to stand in line when you come to Doce.. but it is soooo worth the wait! As many others have said it is very small inside.. only a few seats to sit around the bar at but if you go early enough you can take your food and eat it next door at Twelve! Another great thing about Doce is how inexpensive their amazing tacos are. Any taco is $3! Their sides are also cheap too!   We've had just about every taco on the menu at Doce. Some of my favorites are the carnitas & the pollo. All of the ingredients that they use are super fresh and seriously amazing. Even their jalapenos are the best I've ever had.We also ordered nachos for the first time which I would highly recommend. I am a sucker for hot sauce- so I appreciate the wide selection of hot sauces that they have for their customers too. I use just about every hot sauce on my tacos. Keep up the good work, Doce! I love you!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Va and tried this out based on reviews.  So glad we stopped in!  Very casual and small but food comes fast and is yummy!  Would come again if we come back to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"As Munch the food critic says, this is the place to go if you are very hungry and need that immediate taco fix.  The food is so cheap at 3 dollars a taco, that almost anything would be acceptable at that price point.  I was there around dinner time and it was a lively, fun atmosphere(the chef provides jokes to go with his cuisine, he called up my order in a funnyway) and the food comes at you quicker than a freight train.    The ingredient portions are more than adequate which makes the price point better than average.  The ingredients also seem fresh, but for some reason one of my taco's seemed a bit bland.  I got the vegan taco and the pollo taco.  The vegan seemed to have a bit more flavor, but the chicken was a bit bland and had a slightly fishy taste.  I have no idea where that came from.  I honestly think this place is the first of it's kind in Pittsburgh.  I don't know anywhere else where you can get a taco this fast that's this cheap and that is not from a food truck. For that reason alone I will most likely go back more than a few times.  It definitely filled me up for 8 dollars total including a Jarrito's Guava flavored soda.  I had never had the guava kind which was really wonderful."}
{"text":"So I drunkenly stumbled into this place a year ago and the tacos were amazing then. Of course, I couldn't remember where I had gone until a friend told me it was right by twelve. I finally made it back and its even better sober. By far, the BEST place in Pittsburgh to get tacos. You will never be disappointed, no matter what you choose."}
{"text":"Cool place. Small and simple but really tasty from what I can tell. Got bowl instead of taco (I know, it's a taco place but cutting carbs). Really good. Can't wait to come back and overdose on tacos when I'm off this carb thing! Need a fish taco though."}
{"text":"Am I missing something here?  Bagged shredded lettuce (brown on occasion), mediocre black beans, and too little of the delicious...guacamole and pico de gallo. This is nothing special and certainly nothing to write home about. The tacos were bland. The nachos were something you could get at any sports venue. With the high volume of positive reviews, I expected more. I left underwhelmed and won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in Pittsburgh! Nice portion sizes and a great price. The sauces are all delicious. I like to get the Dino bowl, and the pork is probably my favorite. It is in South Side so it's a popular drunk food spot."}
{"text":"These tacos were sooooooooooo good. And the price was just right. Highly recommended. They do accept credit card, seating is minimal, do not go with a big group, or don't plan to eat inside. It's primarily some bar seating and maybe a few counter top seats away from the bar at the most, pretty compact environment. I don't care though because the tacos are yummy. They don't offer free water, so you gotta buy your drinks from their mini fridge. Parking in this entire area is awful, you'll have to use the side streets till you find a spot (doable) - this is expected for this part of town."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! So flavorful and colorful. I suggest one of each of the 5 to choose from and the daily special. Awesome because they are only $3 a piece. Tried the Carnitas and Pollo, all sorts of goodness. Chef and server super friendly. Cute little place"}
{"text":"Last night I planned on getting home from work, working out, eating a healthy dinner and going grocery shopping.  Instead I laid in bed until Pens traffic died down and dragged my roomie out to SouthSide with me to finally try some tacos from this place. And then we got ice cream. And I have no regrets.  This place is so small you almost miss it, but it is located exactly to the right of Twelve on Carson and is adorable when you get inside.  It's narrow with about 8? barstools lining the counter and maybe two other hightops against the window.  It's decorated in sugar skulls and cool, bright colors and I didn't even mind waiting for my tacos because I was taking in all the décor!  It was Taco Tuesday, but there weren't too many other people in there, probably because it was the first really cool day of the season (plus the Pens game!).  Even Tia, the bartender at Twelve who also works behind the counter at Doce was very surprised at how dead it was.  Service was quick.  I got one chicken and one carnitas taco and my roomie got a chicken (minus avocado) and Americano.  We inhaled them and they were excellent.  We ended up ordering one more each.  Our bellies were stuffed full and we paid (a whopping 11 dollars each for 3 filling tacos and a bottle of water) and were on our way!  I agree with other reviewers when they say that these tacos are better than Las Palmas.  Doce's ingredients are carefully and perfectly executed and my tacos weren't falling apart in my hand like they ALWAYS do everywhere else in Pittsburgh.  They were so full of flavor and everything worked together so nicely.  I always find myself having to add hot sauce or more salsa or salt and pepper, but here - what they served was spot on.  I really liked this place and I think they are doing an amazing job.  I didn't mind the small menu at all and thought it was a nice thing to have a special of the day where you could get something different.  It would be nice to add a fish taco at some point to the regular menu though :) Thanks Doce..Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Doce Taqueria is in Pittsburgh! This place has all the elements of a perfect little taco shop. There are Mexican bottled sodas, the tacos are absolutely delicious, they offer black beans and nachos to supplement the few taco varieties, and the price is right! You just can't go wrong with that.   My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Friday around 6:30, and it wasn't too busy. We were able to sit and put in orders immediately. It was fun watching the staff assemble our food, and the ingredients all looked and smelled incredible. One note about the service...I thought everyone was incredibly friendly and responsive, however I can see the staff potentially forgetting or not seeing you right away on a particularly busy night. Nothing to keep me from coming back, however I think I would prefer to come when it's less busy since I need my tacos customized due to my dairy allergy.  Between us we tried the carnitas, chicken, and beef tacos. I inhaled my carnitas and chicken tacos...they were the best I've had in Pittsburgh by far. In addition to beef and carnitas tacos Kyle got an order of nachos. I could only look longingly at them since I can't have cheese. He said they were wonderful. I had a Mexican Squirt with my meal and he had an interesting variety of Mountain Dew. We'll both be getting Squirt next time! It was surprisingly refreshing. I'm planning on coming back to Doce Taqueria sooner rather than later. I want another carnitas taco already!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It's small but I've never had a bad experience here. They always have different specials on what to order, all of which are to die for! Every time I come I get 2 tacos, they're made so authentically you can't go wrong eating here. In the summer time they have tables outside so you can enjoy the weather and their amazing food. The chicken they make is so flavorful, the employees are so nice and sincere, all around a great place to eat. I will most certainly continue to be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Great hand crafted tacos using fresh, local ingredients? Sí! (SNL Stefan voice while covering nose and mouth) This place has everything...pork, beef, chicken, vegan, pop in glass bottles and fancy, churched up black beans. Friendly service, fun atmosphere (although small) and window seats for watching the fabulous ebb and flow that is Carson street foot traffic. When it comes to tortillas you have two options, flour or corn. My advice is corn...you won't be disappointed. I went for lunch yesterday and ordered the bbq chicken special , the pork and a bottle of Pepsi. Total damage was $8. Great lunch spot, and word is that they are open until 3am on Fri and Sat for those saturated folks leaving the bars and not too keen on pizza."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos at an excellent price point. They have an appealing menu and great service.   The chicken included avocado, farmer's cheese, cilantro and lime. Delicious.  The taco shells are soft, with a choice of flour or corn.  I highly recommend the corn."}
{"text":"Doce is No Nonsense, and they have a straight-forward approach to tacos: Ultra-fresh, quality ingredients = Amazing Tacos.  You won't even mind the lack of octopus or duck confit, promise. The short but solid menu is well thought out and includes a daily special for those who shun conformity.   These are exceptional tacos for the price. And the people who work here are cool as a cucumber (topped with fresa cheese, for good measure.)"}
{"text":"Saw this place pop up while browsing Yelp one day for new eats and decided to swing on by. The joint offers five different premade taco options with fixings made to order: carnitas (pork), pollo (chicken), molida (ground beef), Americano, and vegan, along with a side of beans or nachos as additional paid extras for those wanting a little more to their taco fix. Tacos are $3 each and from what I remember of the sides, I think the beans were $2 and the nachos were $5.  I came and ordered four tacos, one carnitas, one pollo, one molida, and one Americano. Also got them with three corn shells and one flour shell. I will say that I definitely liked the corn shells better ... not as starchy as the flour shell and it has a bit more flavor to it. As for which taco was my favorite? Probably the pork one. The pulled pork in it was tender, juicy, and delicious. The slaw and farmer's cheese in it made each bite all the more tasty. I personally found the chicken to be a bit dry ... might do better for them not to overcook it. The beef one was alright ... it might have tasted better with a bit more cheese in it to offset the acidity that comes from the beef and its juices. Overall I found this place to be a great place to get Mexican tacos ... not sure I'd put them above Las Palmas, but definitely a decent option for those around in South Side!"}
{"text":"They are so awesome here; what a small gem for tacos in Pgh! They have soft corn with this slow roasted pork carnitas OMG. Make sure to get 2-3 at least. They make sauces that you can use there and buy in bottles which the mango is poppin! -Darian"}
{"text":"It's no secret in my Yelp reviews that I LOVE tacos, so when I had been hearing my friends rave about this place for weeks, I knew I had to check it out.  My roommate and I ventured down Carson Street and entered the quaint, colorful restaurant.  A handful of seats are at the cement bar surrounding the taco prep area, and a few more at the window counter.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy, but glad that we were able to grab seats.  I will be honest, I wasn't impressed with the service right off the bat, as it took the two employees working about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing there.  They were working on putting together a couple of orders, but a nod or \"hello\" to acknowledge our presence and impending orders would've been nice.  The gal working finally found a second to take our orders: 3 tacos for me (pork, chicken, and Americano), and 1 taco (pork) and an order of black beans for my roommate.  The tacos came out in a jif, on warm, corn tortillas as requested.  These tacos are the perfect size and good LORD are they delicious.  My favorites, in order, would be the chicken, Americano and pork.  The pork was good, although the slaw that comes on it isn't something I'm a fan of... I'm just not a slaw fan in general so I won't hold that against them.  Doce also offers a cooler full of fun drinks to wash your meal down with, for $2 a pop.  When the check came, I was shocked.  $18. That's it? Should I order more tacos? I mean, EIGHTEEN BUCKS for four tacos, an order of black beans, and two drinks?  I did the math in my head and it checked out.  At $3 a taco, Doce has an advantage over one of my other taco faves in the city, and the location is prime.  I will absolutely be back to this place again and again.  They offer takeout as well!"}
{"text":"I love Pittsburgh, PA it's a great city with great people. Being from San Francisco born and raised and Latino at times I've found it difficult to find a place that sells decent tacos and Latin food in PGH.   I'm glad Doce taqueria is in the southside and just a few blocks away from where I stay when I visit. The tacos and beans are legit. I love the fact that they use queso fresco and crema. Staples for Latin food. The chicken and carnitas are on point. The tortillas are great and it's awesome that they give you options of corn or flour. The beans have a nice kick to them and go well paired with a couple tacos.   Most importantly Steve and Carrie who work at Doce are great people who you can tell care about the quality of the food and make sure patrons are doing well.   I'll be back in town soon and looking forward to having a few tacos and chatting with Steve and Carrie again."}
{"text":"It took me forever to get here having gotten distracted when it first opened by spending the summer in Boston [sigh - I missed so much this Pgh Foodie Summer], so my friend C beat me to the punch and designated this 'Taco Taco - the Taco place'. It's pretty awesome and a fantastic addition to the South Side and Pittsburgh.  The inside is small and simple with a counter and bunch of built-in barstools surrounding the Taco making station. It seats about 10 at the bar and another 3-4 at the window looking out on a busy carson street. The board is straightforward on the selection of 5 tacos. They are nicely sized and extremely juicy and the aroma is just amazing out the door, pretty much literally. Especially for the fantastic price of $3/taco.   Yum, by far, my favorite is the Carnitas [Pork], followed by the Chicken, then the Carne Molida [ground beef]. I haven't gotten to the rest yet, but I'm sure that will happen sooner than later. Also I'm totally digging the Mexican artistic style of the chalk board.   All together, love it and hope it sticks around for a long time. Last piece of advice, either come hungry or leave as soon as you're done. As you are immediately next to the food prepping, the aroma is constantly up in your face, and those who linger will end up eating and eating until you're through the entire menu. Gotta love it."}
{"text":"Had the special its was so good  definitely I'm returning to this Lil spot of heaven TACOS BABY YEAH"}
{"text":"Really awesome tacos! I am glad they are on yelp now- we visited when they first opened and I was disappointed that I could not rush on here & rave about this place; now I can =].  I am SUPER glad to see another taco place in the Southside. Considering tacos are one of my FAVORITE things to eat, I was super excited to check it out. The inside is small and super cute and the staff are very friendly.  My boyfriend and I tried their American style taco, another beef one (can't think of the name) and the chicken taco. We both agree that the chicken taco was the best and is now the only one I will order. Don't get me wrong, the beef was not bad- but I have had better. The chicken is packed with fresh flavors like fresh salsa and avocado and is just incredibly tasty. At $3 a taco, this place is a steal.  What's REALLY awesome about this place? They are open late!  It was a Sunday night when we visited again, probably around 9:30 pm. I was starved and couldn't think of what I could eat in Southside besides pizza. We walked past this place and I couldn't believe they were open. My taste buds were really happy.  This place is great. Go there now."}
{"text":"Damn, dem some tasty tacos. Sometimes I live on the edge and have taco Tuesday on Wednesday. Today was one of those days. They make something funky tasting tacos. And they're nice enough to include slices of lime you could squeeze on to further enhance the flavor."}
{"text":"This place is adorable!  Super small and cute inside, excellent service, and delicious tacos.  I love that they have daily specials and a frequent taco card to earn free food!  I will 100% be back and I can't wait to bring my friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap. I need it all the time now."}
{"text":"Doce is the best! My first time in I made the mistake of ordering flour instead of corn tortillas, luckily they made me try the corn because that makes all the difference!  The carnitas are delicious and the weekly specials can be great too!  This is my go-to place in the south side, dinner or late night.   Also, I don't typically like beans, but theirs even get me....   I'll put Doce up there as tied for the best tacos in the city!"}
{"text":"I was here on 6/19 and ate 3 tacos at the counter. Somehow I found the willpower to not consume any more delicious tacos and the strength to actually leave the tacqueria and not make it my permanent residence. If you're lucky enough to live or work nearby you may find yourself here often - I saw a few people picking up tacos to go. I look forward to seeing how their partnership with the bar next door works, too, since they don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"There I was in the South Side on a Saturday, fresh off of a hair appointment.  I was feelin' quite fly and a bit peckish.  I needed to get a bite to eat to tide me over before meeting a friend for a movie and dinner (in that order.  I resigned myself to Subway because it was across the street from my salon and I knew they'd be cheap and fast, and I had no sooner crossed the street when I noticed the sign for Doce Taqueria.  What's this????? A tacqueria in Pittsburgh???? (Okay, I know they exist, but they're so few and far between in this town.)  Without giving it much more thought, I walked in and was hit by the smell of delicious taco fixins.  There was also a counter full of dudes in there, and I was the only female besides the one working.  It was a little awkward.  I felt like I was invading a Boys Only fort or a secret meeting of the Loyal Order of the Water Buffalo or whatever.  Anyway, I got over that really quickly because this tiny place is full of legit taco goodness.  They have several types to choose from, plus a daily special.  Carnitas, ground beef, chicken, and probably a veggie option if you want it.  I had to hold myself to two tacos served the CORRECT way on two small corn tortillas a piece (I'm judging you if you pick flour), and they were both delicious.  Hell, you can even get a walking taco if you fancy one.  They stay open until quite late on the weekends, which means they must make a killing on the South Side bar crowd.  I'm quite glad that I was able to experience it on a quiet Saturday afternoon, and there's a likely chance that hitting this spot up will be part of my hair appointment routine."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos for a great price! They're daily specials are great and the staff are friendly!"}
{"text":"Yes. Definitely best in PGH. I go here evertime I'm close, or when I'm jonesing for it, which is at least once a week. It's soooooo goood. I always try the special. You can't go wrong here get whatever u want."}
{"text":"God's gift to mankind.  Best little Mexican place in SS and possibly planet earth.  They also have very attractive people that work there as if it couldn't get any better."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to get tacos here. I've never tried any of the sides but I get pollo tacos and carnitas tacos here. I crave them! I'm here probably once a week. And they're only $3 a taco but super fresh. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"THESE WERE THE MOST DELICIOUS NACHOS I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE. Such a great late night food option. Having a tough time in life? Come here. Your problems will all go away. Nothing else will matter."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was not impressed with Doce Taqueria. Not sure how they have a 5 star rating, I've had way better tacos from many other places around Pittsburgh. Service was great and their prices are decent so no complaints there. First off their menu is SO small. Only 5 taco choices and only ONE vegan/vegetarian choice. :( I understand having a small menu but only offering 1 vegetarian option alienates a large group of people. Since I'm mostly vegetarian I had to order 2 of the same tacos. Would have been nice to have at least 2 vegetarian taco options and maybe even 1 fish taco option. The veggie tacos weren't bad but extremely plain. I felt they could have been a little more creative with the tacos. I also ordered the nachos. They were not very good. The chips you could tell were an extremely cheap/generic brand same with the melted cheese wiz type cheese. They have the right idea with the toppings on the nachos but need to have better quality chips and cheese.  Will not bother eating at Doce Taqueria again unless they expand their menu, then I will give them a second try."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Authentic, succulent food, delightful atmosphere and staff are a real pleasure. It's a small space, quaint and charming, you sit at the counter and watch the chef prepare the food, and they also do a robust takeout business. My teenage daughter and I shared three tacos, but should have followed the owner's recommendation that we get two each. The carnitas were perfection, the other two tacos - outstanding. Very affordable, great place to have lunch in the South Side!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Great price! Super friendly staff!   The chicken tacos are my favorite! 2 tacos is usually good for me, even though I really want a third! They make the tacos right in front of you. Quick service. Great tunes. Definitely recommend. Open late on weekends which is a great plus for late night food if you want something light!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place from my Uber Driver.    I had a few cocktails down the street that had great food but ate there a couple of days ago.  I needed a change of pace.  I walked down to Doce Taqueria.   A small restaurant full of flavor and character.  Their menu is on a chalkboard above where the prepare the food.  They have maybe 8-10 seats in a counter type setting.  The place is awesome.   I watched many patrons come in for to-go orders.  Since I was new, I requested the server to choose my selection of 3 tacos (corn tortilla).  I had a beef, pork, and chicken taco.   The beef and chicken were really good but my favorite was the carnitas (pork).   Not only did the port have great flavor, they put all the accouterments that one could want.  All the ingredients were fresh and the meal had great flavor.  Since they do not serve alcohol - I enjoyed a Mexican soda (Grapefruit) which tasted like a Sprite.  The meal was so good - I order 3 more \"to-go\".  I explained to the server I would need to be wearing my sweat pants for the next 3 tacos ;-).   I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend you stop by and give this a try."}
{"text":"Weak taco game. The beef is tasteless. So sad when a proper asada isn't that hard. Flour tortillas are a joke, just like the lettuce and cheese.  I'd only say the pork is close to ok but the rest is far off from decent Mexican or Mexican American and at the end of they day they are asking for tips with 20% min for what is a fast food counter. Maybe the decor only keeps it above 1 star"}
{"text":"Doce Taqueria has been a great addition to the Southside. You can never have enough great taco places in the area! I personally prefer La Palapa, but this isn't far behind. If you're in the mood for a quick, authentic Mexican experience, Doce will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I have had Doce Taqueria bookmarked for some time now, but how often do you go out of your way for street tacos?  However, after attending a 9 PM show at City Theater, I wanted a light snack and discussion time with friends.  This place is simple and good.  There are five kinds of tacos (flour or corn), nachos, and maybe taco salad?  Seating is counter-style, and there are only about nine seats. However, we snagged the last three seats on a Saturday night at 10:45 PM.  I ordered a Carnitas taco on a flour tortilla ($3).  While not my favorite taco of all time, the pork was tender and good, albeit very mild.  However, they have plenty of hot sauce on the counters to spice things up.    If this place is on your way somewhere, it is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Good tacos but not quite the best iv had in PGH. They're Cali style i think, opposed to authentic Mexican tacos such as Las Palmas which i prefer. Very well done nonetheless with super fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Cool little taco spot. Pretty small place, but it has a nice vibe. A lot of people were getting take out, but we got a couple of the seats in the place. Ordered 4 tacos and the nachos (pretty good helping) for my wife and I, and we got out of their for just about $20. Tacos were pretty solid. Nothing to write home about it, but enough to make you happy. Both ordered the Pork which comes with enough toppings to possibly only need one. The nachos were dope though, covered in cheese, sour cream, pico, and jalapeños. Definitely wouldn't mine going back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"In tacos we trust my ass, it should be called in Tacos we find hair. I had 2 in one of my tacos, my girlfriend had a long hair crossing all of her loaded nachos.. loaded with hair at no extra charge. They did graciously give the money back and apologize.   Aren't people supposed to wear hairnets when preparing food? A baseball cap in any enough when you have a ponytail hanging out of it..   Yuk.   Gross.  Go to Las Palmas in Beechview instead, not Oakland, Beechview."}
{"text":"There's a million places for tacos... Is kinda annoying.  Regardless, this place is the only place that I go for tacos. Why? Because the tacos are simply the best. No fancy bullshit foofoo tacos here. Simple fresh delicious.  And they are cheap. Like tacos should be.  No $12 tacos here.  They are 3 bones each.  My favorite is the chicken ones. But they are all good. And sometimes they have featured flavors. Those are always great.  There's sometimes a line. Don't be deterred...it usually goes fast. Don't expect to find a seat if they were busy though."}
{"text":"Tacos are still delicious but service has been horrible the last few months. The cooks are good but there's one cashier who is just awful... rude, rushes you despite there being no line, impatient and overall just seems annoyed the whole time  I have recommended this place to countless people. Not to mention brought my friends here from out of town.. I've brought my family here from out of state the girl's horrible attitude totally ruined it for all of them."}
{"text":"Doce has the best value for tacos you can find. Well cooked, well prepared, good ingredients and consistent. I don't know anyone who doesn't eat here multiple times every week. Get the special!"}
{"text":"Great place! Amazing tacos and awesome atmosphere. The staff couldn't be nicer! I recommend the carnitas. Get here asap!"}
{"text":"Good price for some pretty good tacos.  Good service and cute atmosphere.  Please, please, please have more vegetarian or fish options on the permanent menu.  The vegetarian tacos are pretty boring compared to how good the meat tacos look."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh. Plus they are cheaper than most 'boutique' taco spots. Also they are open late. Basically, if you like tacos, then go to Doce. Not tomorrow, not next time you're in the southside, right now... I'll see you there..."}
{"text":"I visited Doce Taqueria on Tues. prior to a Cinco de Mayo themed Yelp event at another nearby restaurant.  I'd been meaning to stop by, but it'd been awhile since I'd stopped for grub on the South Side.  This event, plus the fact that it was Taco Tuesday, gave me sufficient motivation to check it out.  Because I knew there would be snacks at the event, I decided to go with two tacos ($3 each)--one of the daily special (BBQ pork), and one of the pollo (chicken), both on corn tortillas.  Of the two, the chicken was the more subtly flavored, consisting of the namesake meat plus avocado, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese.  The addition of a spritz of juice from an included piece of lime added a jolt of citrusy flavor, upping the ante.  The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a veritable flavor explosion, consisting of cherry peppers, shredded cheese, and cilantro. Though I enjoyed them both, the special was my favorite of the two due to its bold flavors.  Like many eateries in the South Side, the space is pretty small, with seating limited to the bar and a small ledge by the window, and no real tables.  From my visit, it appeared that the majority of orders were of the carry out variety, but a few other people also ate in, in addition to me.  Service was pretty efficient--my order was out in 5 min, which I appreciated given that I arrived a bit later than I'd planned to.  The decor was quite festive, evoking a kitschy SoCal vibe, which seemed particularly appropriate given the day and time of my visit.  The atmosphere reminded me of a similar taco shop on the North Side, but I enjoyed the food more and found the price point more reasonable.  While I'd rate the tacos at Las Palmas and Edgar's slightly higher, if you should find yourself nearby, I'd definitely say Doce is worth a visit! 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"--Updated again, and hopefully final Review---  Left with few appealing options and driven by starvation I came back into Doce recently.  My resolve apparently did not last long.    I was hoping to remain anonymous during my time there, but unfortunately it was obvious that I was recognized by the staff almost immediately.  Apparently being the first person to leave a negative review of a 5 star restaurant makes you pretty recognizable.  During my time there I was treated very well by the staff and the food was excellent.  When I asked for the check I was told my meal was on the house; an effort to compensate me for my negative experience here.  I tried again to pay for my meal and the staff member was adamant that my payment would not be accepted.  I thanked him, tipped, and was on my way.  Hopefully my previous negative experience was a one time thing. I plan to continue coming back, and I encourage others to do so as well."}
{"text":"This spot could have easily just been a food truck. The vegetables and preparation were all top notch. Taste was good but the meat was very dry. If I was drunk, it would have been flawless. $3 per taco seems a bit steep but they have plenty of hot sauces. I went here two nights in a row since I was staying nearby. Quite a party street but pretty good for drunks."}
{"text":"Customer service SUCKS!  Good food. Great Carnitas!  . Gnats all over the place.  If you want gnats while you eat. This is your place. ABSOLUTELY NOT  taqueria!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best tacos in town. Fun establishment too. Not fancy, not trying to outdo itself. Just good, quick reasonably priced, delicious tacos. With corn tortillas!"}
{"text":"Food truck only:  I went to Thrival Fest last weekend and tried a taco after long last!! I have followed them on Instagram for some time but never got around to it. Boy was that a mistake! I don't think I can say enough wonderful things about the taco I had, but I will try. They had a very small and to the point menu, with one vegetarian option, so that is what I ordered. The tacos were $4 each and absolutely perfectly sized for the price. They don't short you on the filling! Enough filling that I ate it with a fork. You have an option of corn or flour tortillas, which is also excellent. Although I have heard good things about their corn tortillas, I opted for the flour just because I like flour tortillas better. I'm a poser, I know!   The filling for the veg taco was perfectly spicy and all around a really excellent taco. They seem to have a different sort of taco for their restaurant menu as opposed to the food truck menu when it comes to vegetarians/vegans, so I will have to swing by the southside and try it! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place so far to get a taco in Pittsburgh! It is always fresh and delicious. Every time I go in, I make it a point to try at least one of the daily special. They usually have unique combinations to try as the daily special. You could also never go wrong with the carnitas on corn! To top everything off, they are only $3 a piece. I get 2 and I am satisfied! I definitely recommend Doce Taqueria."}
{"text":"The tacos at Doce are outstanding. Choice of corn or flour. Chicken is smoked and perfectly marinated. Pork is spiced just right. Spicy beef has a good kick.  Meat filling is hefty but not overdone.  Toppings are excellent; fresh pico, avocado, quesa fresco, cilantro.  Great hot pepper sauce choices too. At $3 a pop, can't be beat."}
{"text":"Doce is... alright.  However, I was thoroughly underwhelmed the three times I've come to Doce over the years.  The tacos were fine, but just average and I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I definitely feel like there are better tacos in Pgh.  If it's late at night on Carson and you're hungry, you'll most likely enjoy these tacos. Also, the interior is tiny and cute."}
{"text":"Maybe I've had a sheltered life, but these are the best tacos I've ever had. So delicious. The staff was nice and I loved sitting along the window people watching."}
{"text":"I could eat these tacos every day! (and trust me, there have been weeks where I have!) You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"\"Good things come in small packages\", they say, and this little joint is a prime example. Quirky, cozy taqueria with good food and service!"}
{"text":"Cheap, flavorful, fast tacos served counter-side in a happening part of town. We headed in around 8pm on a Friday, grabbed a parking spot right out front without an issue and grabbed three seats at the counter just the same. We ordered 3 tacos.... 2 vegetarian , 1 vegan. They were the same, just one without the Mexican farmer's cheese. Very tasty and corn is definitely the way to go for your shell. (You choose between corn or flour). We also grabbed classic Jarritos from the case for $2 a pop. My girls ate their tacos in two seconds flat, said they were so delicious and each ate two more! So yea, kiddos approved. They were good and I would recommend them for an inexpensive quick bite. My only gripe with be that they were out of avocado!!! I get that it was the end of the night, but c'mon!"}
{"text":"One of the newest taco spots in the Pittsburgh area has really come out swinging.  Very excellent food inside a small location with hands on service. I'm a taco fan and this place will have me coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"Total Awesomeness!!! Best tacos I've ever had. From the second you walk in the door the authentic aromas and décor draw you closer, the friendly and engaging staff draw you closer and then the food...oh the food!!!  If one passes this place up for a burger or some other quick meal they would truly be missing out on a little piece of heaven in a shell!"}
{"text":"My food goal for the summer is to eat everywhere i haven't been in the southside. While I could be perfectly happy eating the BLT at Piper's on a daily basis (vindaloo bacon! ), there is an endless abundance of restaurants in my neighborhood and it is unfair to eat only at a few choice places.   I hadn't gone to Doce before. It's always pretty busy when I've tried and I can say now that I gave up too easily! My meal was done in 3 minutes and was $8 for 2 tacos and a bottle of water. I got a chicken and a spicy beef. The chicken was pretty good. I'm more of a beef or pork taco girl though. So the spicy beef was my favorite! And really the tortillas were the best part! Fresh, toothsome a grilled perfectly! Some people do not know how important good corn tortillas are! The tacos were really full too! AND because they used the above mentioned quality tortillas, they were formidable enough to handle the filling!  I loved everything! I kind of messed up though! They have specials and there was a chicken taco with a blueberry slaw that i should have opted for! Overall though, loved it and it is a great, cheap option outside of pizza and gyros (lesvos and benny fierro's forever!) when you need something quick and filling!"}
{"text":"I came across this taco shop and was excited since I am new here from the West Coast where Mexican food, especially tacos are very common. I was highly disappointed in the lack of authenticity. I ordered a beef taco, which was made of ground beef, not carne Asada (seasoned cut steak) and I also ordered the loaded nachos which came with pork. The nachos were covered in a cheese \"sauce\" (instead of melted shredded cheese). The pork was ok but both were very bland and extremely \"white washed\" Mexican. Unfortunately I will not be returning."}
{"text":"On my way to a meeting, I stopped in grab a quick bite. I stopped in at just the right time as a few people were leaving the counter.  As it was my first time at the taqueria, I asked what the recommended. The others at the bar suggested I try both a corn and flour tortilla so that I get the best of both worlds. I chose the vegetarian (black bean) and chicken tacos.  The tacos were ready in a flash and came topped with cheese and a lime on the side. The tacos were both delicious and I think that the black bean was my favorite. Both weren't as flavorful as I would have imagined, I was expecting more of a punch, but you could tell that the quality was there.  This place is pretty small and only seats up to maybe 8 or so at time, so if you're looking for a late night snack, definitely grab and go!"}
{"text":"I reviewed this place 5 stars previously but I have to drop a star. This was my go to spot for tacos, and I still enjoy it from time to time, but the quality and service has definitely diminished. I hope it's only temporary."}
{"text":"** Pretty good tasting tacos but portions are on the smaller side and the chicken tastes salty. Still prefer Las Palmas in Oakland in my personal opinion, but worth the shot.  Went here for my friends 21st birthday, and I ordered two beef tacos and one chicken, all on flour tortillas. The added guac on the chicken taco definitely caught my eye (as a true California native), and it definitely packed a punch. I do have to say however, that the chicken was pretty salty, and overall I left feeling pretty thirsty. The meat was pretty good as well.  I do have to say that the portions are a bit of a setback. I paid $9 for three tacos, and didn't think it was enough for a whole meal. Luckily, I went to Benny Fierro's for some jumba pizza slices after for that bang bang (a term I learned from another Yelp eliter - funny reacts if you get the reference).   This place is technically a sit down place but you can also get the tacos to go. Seating however is very limited as it is a small restaurant. Personally I like the fact that you can do your own add ons for salsa, cilantro, etc. at Las Palmas, and I definitely think I am a lot more full after eating Las Palmas. However, Doce offers inside seating which Las Palmas doesn't have, and hasn't been shut down for having sanitary issues."}
{"text":"Five stars the whole way. Had walked past this place a few times since moving to Pittsburgh. Decided today was the day to try it out. Great success. Had the special, a honey buffalo chicken taco, and the had to come back 20 minutes later with my girlfriend for more. She was also incredibly pleased. Will certainly be coming back often."}
{"text":"This was so great.  We walked in and walked out within 5 minutes.  Got four tacos and nachos.  Everything was delicious and incredibly inexpensive.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good, simple, familiar flavor combinations.  Top quality ingredients.    Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"This place gets it right. From the el yucateco hot sauce to the tortillas, this is as close to authentic Mexican as you'll get in PGH. The space is small and usually busy, but prices are fair and the food is good.  Daily specials are always amazing and worth the exploration. Truly a great experience."}
{"text":"Great taco restaurant on Southside. Their ingredients always taste fresh, and everything goes together very well. Prices since this review are $3/taco. All of their tacos are phenomenal (beef, pork, chicken, never tasted vegetarian). Nachos are decent, but I think their strength lies in their main course. They offer corn or flour tortilla which can be grilled to perfection. The only gripe I have is that their seating is very limited to about 10-12, and they can get super busy!"}
{"text":"I wandered in here after bar hopping. The food was so amazing, I decided that I had to come back when I was sober to make an actual judgement on if it was as delicious as I thought it was.  It was.  This quickly became one of my favorite places to grab food on East Carson. I honestly think this taco place beats out the famed Las Palmas, in Oakland, as well as Reyna's in the Strip. The tacos offered here may not be as 'authentic', but the fusion of American and Mexican in a no-nonsense way is kind of really amazing.   I think I've tried every taco offered, and they're all good. However, my favorites are the pork tacos, and the chicken nachos. The prices are extremely reasonable ($3 a taco, $5 for nachos), and they take cards! They also serve soda in glass bottles, which is nice.   The place is open late on weekends, making it the perfect drunk munchie sort of place."}
{"text":"Mmm tacos :) I'm currently on the hunt to find the best taco places in Pittsburgh and I was really excited when I found this place on Yelp. Sadly this place probably wouldn't make it on the top 5.   The restaurant itself is very cute but also very small. Don't plan on eating here if you have a big group or it's prime lunch/dinner hours. This establishment is more of a order and go place.  As for the tacos they do a specialty taco that changes daily I believe. You can follow their Instagram account to keep up with the daily options. This was probably one of my favorite aspects. Otherwise they just offer a handful of basic tacos that aren't out of the ordinary in any way. The specialty tacos is what makes me want to go back again and again to try the different tacos. I will say I wasn't all that impressed with the flavor of the tacos. I think they lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos I have ever had! The price being super reasonable is just an added bonus. I would easily pay $5 a piece for these tacos, so you cant beat $3/taco. I have only tried the carnitas, chicken, and one of the specials and they were all amazing! I always want to order three tacos because they are that good, but two tacos will fill you up just fine."}
{"text":"I came here because a friend recommended me to try the tacos. It was a bit far from where I lived, so I was hesitant to go, but I'm glad that I came. When I first got to the place, I was surprised at how small it was. However, there were a ton of people there.   The decorations were really cool, and the art on the menu contributed to a fantastic ambience. I ordered the spicy beef taco and the regular beef taco ($3 for each), and my friend got loaded nachos. The service was fast (compared to how many people were there). My friend was really happy about the loaded nachos - for $5, she got an incredible amount which would have cost maybe $8-9 at another restaurant.   My tacos came a bit after and I tried the spicy beef one first. My only disappointment was that the spicy beef meant that it was just a regular beef taco with jalapenos in it, whereas I was expecting actual spices in the beef. However, the tacos were really flavorful, and I loved the toppings. The corn tacos were also able to hold all the meat without falling apart - a pretty impressive feat, if you ask me :) And for a price of $3 per taco, it's relatively inexpensive as well.  Overall, I recommend this place and will be back again. To CMU kids - it's kinda far from campus, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Twelve has masterminds behind their businesses. This taco place is so so so delicious!! I can't rave how much I love the tacos here. It's a bit small on the inside, but that gives it more character. Eat everything!"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.    This place is tiny. I usually don't like that, but for whatever reason it didn't seem like that much of a problem. Me and some girlfriends were here on a Friday night to grab some chow before heading over to a game night. I loved the decor, and the cooks were both very friendly and personable. They had most everything ready to go in steam trays so they can throw together orders quickly, but don't let that deceive you into thinking the food isn't delicious.   We shared some veggie nachos that were delish and only $4 for a big container. I got two pork tacos and one spicy beef. The pork was super legit, moist, and the toppings were the bomb diggity. I also liked the spicy beef, which is interesting because I usually don't go for beef tacos. I was bummed to not see chorizo on the menu, but I was told they have a daily special taco and they sometimes feature the chorizo.   Tacos were $3/per, and drinks from the cooler were all the old school cane sugar ones and Jarritos for only $2 each. This place stays open til 3am on the weekends to accommodate the drunk Southside crowd, and is thankfully NOT cash only.  Great addition to the dope little food joints in the Southside. One of the cooks told me they plan on expanding into the space next door, but I sort of don't want anything to change because it's pretty amazing as is."}
{"text":"Small and neighborhoody, this is a \"joint,\" plain and simple. Tacos are $3 a piece, drinks are $2 (oh, and no fancy pants cocktails here ... just sodas--all made with cane sugar--and water). And folks, it'll be the best $10-$15 you ever spend on tacos.   There are 5 choices: carnitas (pork), chicken, spicy beef, American (read: NOT spicy) beef, and vegan. Dear GOD, are these tacos good. We (my adventurous eating kids and I) had an assortment, but agreed that the carnitas was far and away the best. We also had some refried bean dip, hot and steaming and yummy on a cold fall day, to mix things up a bit.   There are just a few stools to sit on around the counter, and the folks who create this delicious goodness are friendly and chatty (and who totally indulged my daughters games and party tricks, which are endless).  Super solid choice of yum in the South Side (I want to go back today!)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Doce Taqueria.   It's a simple operation that provides good, quality, affordable, and quick food.   Tacos.  *they do have a couple other options, but for Pete's sake, it's a Taqueria.   $3 gets you a taco! I usually get 3 (my wife gets 2). They have chicken, beef, carnitas (pork), and veggie options. And they all have fresh toppings with a choice of corn or flour tortillas.  Get. The. Carnitas. They'll make you want to . . . Do-ce-do.  (Corn Torillas all day)  Do they provide authentic Mexican tacos? It feels like it. There are very specific food carts I go to in our city to get the truly authentic Mexican taco experience, but I have to be honest...Doce keeps coming to mind.  I do wonder what happens on the 12th visit.   The inside is small but inviting. Bar-ish style seating. Day of the dead and generally bizarre decor that I like, right off of E Carson.   In the Southside and need a quality bite? Need to move quick? Need to take it to go or to sit in? Need a 12pm lunch spot. I mean...Doce makes it obvious! Eat there."}
{"text":"**This review is for their food truck**  This is probably the best thing on four wheels. They offered about 5 different tacos and a few other items such as beans, nachos and walking tacos.   I ordered 2 carnitas and 1 chicken on corn tortillas. They were $4 and very filling. I would've liked the corn tortillas to have been a little crispier but that's just my preference. They were still delicious! The guac on the chicken taco was so fresh and garlicky. And the cilantro and cojita (I think??) on top of all of them just really made them amazing. The meats were smoky and tender and a little juicy.   If you see this rolling by, follow it and get some tacos!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the man while walking our dog down Carson the other day.  Loved the casual vibe - walk in, grab taco, bounce.    Since we were literally just walking by, we got the spicy beef taco.  Loved the corn tortilla option, nice balance of flavor, good quality.  I definitely will go back and try some of the other options.  I would love to see a shredded beef option :)  Were they the best street-ish tacos I've had in Pittsburgh?  No - that will go to Las Palmas or Reynas.  But they are still really good and definitely the best in Southside!"}
{"text":"We tried Doce Taqueria this past weekend after hearing about it from a neighbor/friend on the Southside. We were very happy with our dinner and the price was great. Everything was very fresh and we both agreed that the pork tacos are the way to go (much more flavor than the chicken). You MUST try to the black beans! The restaurant is small, so consider ordering to-go if you have a group.  My only complaint is the lack of drink options. They only had a cooler stocked with bottled sodas and iced tea. I would have loved an ice-cold fountain drink to go with my tacos. We even considered going across the street to DQ to grap a diet coke.   Overall, it's definitely something you should try. There's nothing better than fresh, flavorful Mexican food."}
{"text":"Tacos are street food and this place makes no pretenses about that. You get tacos. Delicious tacos without any frills.   It's not upscale, it's just tacos.   I could eat here every meal every day"}
{"text":"However many tacos you order, no matter how full you get, you will secretly still want more!  I tried 3 of their 5 main offerings and recommend the Carnitas taco the most.  I'm so glad I didn't get pizza again.  Another thing worth mentioning is that you will be eating within minutes of your arrival.  It's great, come see."}
{"text":"I think o could eat Mexican every day and be happy. When I heard about this new place I had to try it. The restaurant is small with s few bar stools at the front window and a few pulled up to the side of the bar. I posted pics so you could get an idea of the decor. It's colorful and lively. They have a big chalkboard that states the tacos they offer. They all looked good but I went for the Americano and the Pollo. They offer flour or corn taco shells. They have a small vintage fridge filled with sodas.  They say the Americano is just like your mom makes. That might be true if your mom is Hispanic. It had seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese and cream (sour cream).  The beef was seasoned well and it was a lot of meat for a taco. The shell was soft and all of the flavors melded together. It was one of the best tacos I've had (and I have had many. LOL. The Pollo (chicken) taco had the crumbling Mexican cheese, some avocado, cream along with a lime wedge. The chicken was juicy and the lime juice was perfect. Yum!! Tacos are $3 each.  For four tacos and 2 sodas it was $16. That's a cheap lunch date. That's cheap for tacos that good. They have nachos for $4, add meat and it's $5. They do a great business and are open til 3am on weekends."}
{"text":"The best- no, the ONLY place to get tacos in Pittsburgh. I always leave with a full belly and looking forward to the next visit. My favorite taco is hands down the chicken- it's just sooo darn good. Juicy chicken, refreshing creama and avocado, mmmm. I also love the pulled pork taco and usually find myself going for their daily special. Today it was Korean bbq chicken- it was what I can only describe as transcendent. The loaded nachos are always a hit and super filling. I tried a Dino bowl for the first time today- courtesy of the owner. It was super filling and delicious. A great and healthy option that makes you forget you're getting a huge helping of veggies and protein. The hospitality on top of the delicious food simply can't be beat. Any time I'm drinking in or near the south side, I think I look forward to the late night tacos more than the drinks. I also love Doce because I never feel guilty about stuffing myself full- the ingredients are truly so fresh and good for you that even those who \"watch what they eat\" can feel good about a meal here. If you haven't tried this place yet, you're seriously missing out!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times I usually order carnitas on corn tortillas it is my favorite. I have ordered their nachos and you get a huge portion of them for the price it's enough for three people to eat. The line can get really long especially on weekends but the employees move fast it is not much of a sit-down restaurant it's more for grabbing a quick bite to eat. I ordered their special taco once it was the orange chicken with wasabi sauce it was good but it was really spicy and I like spicy food but I couldn't finish it. I'll definitely be back to order more tacos here."}
{"text":"So in my second and third visits I decided to update my review from yes to *insert expletive here* yes!  The place is consistently good. The special changes and the quality remains the same. Ownership clearly gives a care about the satisfaction of their customers. This place doesn't over-brand and then push the price based on it being a trendy cool spot. They should change the name to hey man, here's a taco, I hope you enjoy it and also your day.   Granted that wouldn't fit on the sign and is a mouth-full(pun intended) so Doce Taqueria is fine. A place like this deserves the traffic simply because it 1. Is simple and priced accordingly 2. It is quick and convenient and tasty(quality meat). 3. It's a pleasure just visiting when the staff and ownership are chill chill cool beans.  Bottom line go to Doce if you're hungry and want a taco man.Go if you're not hungry and want a taco. Just go!"}
{"text":"I went here late at night after going out in Southside so it was reasonably packed. I only wanted two vegetarian tacos to take home and the line was massive. I didn't mind waiting and I had a friend get the food for us while we waited outside. Once I opened my to-go box to eat my tacos they were completely destroyed and I didn't shake or drop the box. I think they were too busy and in such a rush. Even after getting all the ingredients back together, the tacos weren't great. I've had amazing vegetarian tacos and these were nothing special, even if they're cheap."}
{"text":"Two things I asked for when I ordered tacos here: CORN SHELL and JUST CHEESE- no sour cream. The girl taking my order understood but the guy making my order completely disregarded her notes. I got a sour cream-drenched mess in a flour tortilla. Not worth the wait or the price- never again!!!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe.  Cool place with good service.  Tacos are great.  I'd say a notch better than the overrated Tako but a notch below the flavor of Bakersfield.  They have beef, veg, chicken, and carnitas as well as a rotating special.  Will be back for sure!  The Cholula crema on top is amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite taqueria in Pittsburgh! I've been there many times. The chicken tacos are my go to... so much delicious flavor for an affordable price! And you MUST get them on corn tortillas - so much better than flour!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to stop in for a quick bite or grab something to go. There isnt much room inside for seating so I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group. I ordered a black bean taco with cheese & crema & it was SO good.    The food tastes fresh & everything is put together right in front of you. I want to go back soon to try the loaded nachos because they looked amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. My favorite stop in Pittsburgh. YUM. The atmosphere is comfortable and cozy, beautifully and vibrantly decorated. $3 might sound expensive for a single taco, BUT I PROMISE ITS WORTH IT. My only gripe is that every once in a while when they are busier than average, my tacos can get a little sloppily thrown together and my specifications to my order are ignored, but that is totally forgivable when you've got a line out the door and down the street. In any case, I try to make a stop at least once every time I am in town, and I'm super thankful to my friend for introducing me to this place!"}
{"text":"Doce Tacos are SO good! Not much room for seating, but the tacos are so good, you will gladly take them to go.    I'm a big fan of the chicken and black bean, but my friends swear by the pork. Long story short, you can't go wrong!   Tacos are $3 a piece. It makes for an affordable snack, or a cheap dinner.   Two tacos curb the appetite, three tacos leave you perfectly full."}
{"text":"You'll walk in for two and end up having four. Incredibly delicious tacos at a great little shop found hidden among a slew of deep fried dives and bars. Just walking in is a breath of fresh air. Service is excellent and it's fun watching this guy rock out these tasty tacos. Loved it and will be back time and again."}
{"text":"I must preface that I am from California and my expectations of tacos are high. So with that said, I gave them four stars because because a restaurant is rated on more than food.  The layout of the space is very nice and I love the esthetic. Now let's get to the meat and potatoes...  The best taco that I tried was the pork. The meat was flavorful and the profile of flavors was very nice. I had it on corn and it went well. Their corn shells are a bigger and thicker than most street tacos.  Now, I tried both beef tacos and they were good but not the best I've ever had obviously but for Pittsburgh they are good. Now when I saw beef I immediately think carne asada or something in that range and they just serve regular ground beef. I feel they put to many toppings on the tacos and it gets away from the flavor.  I didn't taste the chicken because I'm not a fan of chicken tacos but according to my boyfriend it was good. Also, I think that trying their tacos on flour may be better but it will be my reasoning for going back.  Overall, I'd patron again but not with the expectations of being blown away but of having a decent taco"}
{"text":"Tacos and drinks were great. You'll miss it if you aren't paying attention. I'm a Texas taco girl and was impressed."}
{"text":"Doce Taqueria is just like a gourmet cupcake shop, but for tacos. They're open late and serve their fare up quickly, making them one of my top choices in the neighborhood. Generally speaking, I love the chicken and pork tacos and find them marinated to perfection with crisp, fresh toppings. The staff are extremely friendly (less so when you get closer to 2am, but I don't blame them for dealing with all the drunken shenanigans) and the price isn't too extreme ($3/taco). The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because on my most recent visit, the tacos were just so-so, indicating some consistency issues. They also really skimped on the avocado, which is one of my favorite parts! On my previous visits, all varieties were excellent, but something was just 'off' this time around and my boyfriend agreed (he had a different variety than I did). The shop is super tiny, so seating is tough. All in all, my favorite pick for a quick snack or late night food on East Carson."}
{"text":"We happened to stop here for lunch this weekend and we were so glad we did.  I had two tacos (siracha chicken and the pork) he had four (siracha chicken, regular chicken, pork, and beef) and we shared the nachos with meat.  Heaven.  Such wonderful food!  I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"Really great taco spot in South Side. It's small in size, but it definitely delivers. I ordered the pollo and carne molida tacos (chicken and beef) on corn tortillas and they were absolutely delicious.   There was only one person working when we ordered, so we waited about 10 minutes for our tacos from the time we arrived. The chef was quick and would often fill three orders at once. With a steady flow of customers, I thought his timeliness was quite impressive. No one was left waiting for long at all.  If you're looking to order the daily special, they ran out around 6 PM even though this taco shop is open until midnight during most week days.  I will definitely be returning, and I recommend this spot to anyone looking for delicious tacos around Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is the hands down the best taco place in Pittsburgh. The tacos are made fresh on order and are extremely tasty. The service is good and there is usually no wait. The price is extremely reasonable with 3 dollars a taco. They have a variety of hot sauces to choose from also. The music is always good too."}
{"text":"This place is thebomb.com. Favorite quick lunch spot in the southside, super vibrant and pleasant on the inside, and their food specials are incredible, especially with how little you pay. Everything on their set menu is excellent, as well. All of the employees are super friendly and passionate, too. A place like this has been needed in this neighborhood for years now, and I'm so glad a place like this exists here now."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic tacos. Omg. It wasn't until I finished eating that I realized I should've taken a photo.  I savored every moment while eating. Not only are they friendly but their tacos are packed with flavor. I'll definitely make this my go to spot on Carson. You can't beat three dollars tacos."}
{"text":"i eat here like once a week, if i can eat outside or take it with, its way better. i always get vegan tacos but have had black beams, nachos, chicken. the one chef bangs music which is cool, very LA but its overwhelming in that small space. ingredients are super fresh. avocado seems to run out a lot. its quick, easy, fresh and delicious, just seldom the same every time."}
{"text":"The tacos are undeniably good, and the cooks are cool and friendly.  My 5 star review drops to 3 due to service... sorry to say but basically all of the girls helping the cooks have terrible attitudes for what seems to be a pretty laid back job."}
{"text":"Solid taco spot have never really had a bad taco. I used to work right next door but not down that way much these days"}
{"text":"Yum! We haven't had their tacos in awhile since we aren't in the area very much anymore. We were thrilled to see them at Little Italy Days and enjoyed every single bite of our tacos.   The ingredients are fresh, flavorful and compliment each other so well. The employees are friendly and super willing to make substitutions. As a vegetarian, I appreciate the multiple options and love that they put as much thought into the vegetarian dishes as their others.   We never miss an opportunity to get their tacos and hope to stumble on their truck again soon!"}
{"text":"Doce Taqueria definitely serves up the best tacos around. They are meticulously crafted with a myriad of ingredients that flow together perfectly. They aren't your run of the mill ground beef, lettuce and cheese (though they do have their own take on that-if that's your thing).  Their tacos are a small and sold individually so if you're not that hungry you can just grab one for $3, but my husband and I usually stick with three a piece. Its cheap and filling. Perfect for grabbing a quick (and sublime) bite.  Quick being the operative word. You must either grab and go, or plan on woofing it down at their very limited bar seating. This very limited seating, however, in no way takes away from the dining experience. It actually benefits them, and you. It makes the whole experience a certain aesthetic and event, all the while forcing the masses attempting to consume tacos through the line with precision and speed.  I have tried every single taco option they have, and they are all excellent. I have, however, for my tastes, narrowed it down to an ordering formula. I always get the special, the pollo and the carnitas- all on CORN tortillas (that is KEY). With absolute modesty, I can say, it is perfection.  Seriously, if you are looking for tacos and are into well crafted \"foodie\" food. Look no further. Eat here. Trust me."}
{"text":"Good tacos.  Limited menu but so good.  Always seems to be busy.  The staff taking orders had to run to get some more food and so the cook was taking orders too.  Had the special of the day that was a Buffalo chicken with some peppers and I forget the other items.  Good taco but wish the chicken had a tad more flavor.  For my second taco ordered a carnitas that is one of my faves.  If you want a good taco at a reasonable price.  This is the place to go if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The best little gem of a taco joint. Bar seating and that's it. Even if you have to eat your tacos standing up, you don't give a damn because they're that delicious. Great vegan and vegetarian options. And if you're like me and go often, they'll even switch up the veg tacos for you if you ask :-)"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best taco places in Pittsburgh! You can't go wrong with any option. I came here on a Friday night around 9pm. It was just fully occupied, but we only had to wait literally one minute for two seats to open up. I tried the carnitas and ground beef tacos on corn tortillas. Both were awesome. All the ingredients worked really well together. And each taco is only $3! I definitely prefer Doce Taqueria to Las Palmas. Also, the service is great; everyone is clearly happy to be there.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 4 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh! The Pollo is excellent and the special of the day \"Honey Roasted Pork\" was amazing. Can't beat the price either. I just ate here and I'm already craving them again. We sat in at the bar but seems like a great place for take out!"}
{"text":"Great little taco stand. Tacos have a great authentic taste. And the atmosphere makes you feel like your in a small little Cali food stand."}
{"text":"I came across Doce last night on Yelp while looking for another restaurant.  My wife is always on the lookout for a good Mexican place and so I sent her the link for Doce.  We ran down today for lunch and are glad we did.  The food was great.  Everything looked fresh, tasted wonderful, and (best of all) was cheap.  I am not a tomato fan, but ate everything that was put in my basket - everything was too good to start picking things off of.  We had several varieties of the taco's along with an order of nachos.  My only \"complaint\" was the size of the shop -- it was really small -- seating was counter-style and at best accommodated 15.  We stopped in during a lull in the lunch crowd and it was still almost full.   We'll be back though - just try to keep a couple of seats open for us....."}
{"text":"Stayed down the street and found this place on Yelp & gave it a shot. Friendly folks, quick service & tasty tacos.   I got the Americano, Pollo & pulled pork tacos & all the meat was flavorful. Pollo probably was my favorite & the toppings were fresh.   Loved that they were only $3 apiece, so we grabbed & went. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Simple menu, delicious food! My favorite is the Americano on flour. But I suggest trying everything across the board. Walking tacos are unique, fun, and good too."}
{"text":"Considering its guests are prone to proffering illicit drugs in pill form, especially the homeless vagabonds attempting to solicit a taco and mooch off every patron inside, the food is life-changing and should not be missed despite the grungy frequenters."}
{"text":"Spectacularly good tacos. I would put their food up against any restaurant in the city. And incredibly inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in a long time! I literally come here once a week since finding out about this place. Affordable too!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a good taco place on Carson since Yo Rita and this place charges $3 a taco. DONE. Taste is great. People are nice. Gotta make this place stick around. It's my staple now for pick up food"}
{"text":"For Pittsburgh- this is a great taco option. Delicious flavor combinations and weekly specials. However, I've noticed the taco portion size drastically varies based on who's making them. There's been times where they hook it up and give you a good amount of 'fixings', and times where it's mostly a mouth-full of tortilla. More consistency and I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"As a native Californian, I have always hoped there would one day be a place I could get authentic Mexican tacos while visiting my family out in PA. Dose Taqueria has truly answered my prayers. Biting into one of these tacos instantly reminded me of the tacos I get at little family owned taco shops back in San Diego. Every ingredient, down to the Cotija cheese, is 100% authentic and 100% delicious.   Doce Taqueria perfectly captured a flavor that you usually can only get in Mexicali.  Chef Alex has truly brought a price of the southwest to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Yum! I've been waiting to try this place. Finally Friday, me and the boyfriend came around 7:30pm. It was indeed a small place, but a very cute taco shop. we were pretty surprised how short the menu is, however, everything on the menu looks so appetizing to me. I ordered three diff tacos: daily special (pork, cucumber, hoisin sauce, and cilantro), pollo, and carne molida. Mmm my favorite one is probably the carne Molida because I'm a big fan of spicy food. The other two were very tasty as well.  We sat at the bar to eat our tacos. At first we came in there aren't many people, about 4 people. However, there were only one guy making tacos. We had to wait awhile for him to take our orders. After we got our orders in, the food came pretty quickly. While we were eating, I found that many people come in and out very rapidly. A lot of people got to go tacos. The price is very reasonable. Overall, My stomach was very content :) We both love it and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The food is great!! Fresh fast and legit. Quality ingredients and great chef innovations on the specials of the day.  Unfortunately the young lady working on July 8 at 130pm was not well versed in customer service.  Simple things like greeting the customers, answering questions without being rude, and being nice seem to not have been available to her that day."}
{"text":"A lovely little taco place with a great vibe. Everybody becomes friends instantly when you step in there. The staff is very friendly, and quick. If there's a line, they still greet you and make you feel seen when you step in. The tacos are incredible, super tasty and at $3 a piece you can really indulge. It doesn't matter if it's 2pm or 2am, you will always be in the mood for some Doce."}
{"text":"I think I need to mention off the bat that the menu here is small. Guys, that's a good thing. Seriously, restaurants with overwhelming menus just cause confusion and longer waits at times. When there's a concentrated menu food seems to be more fresh and on point. There are taco specials that change and that's a nice little surprise when you're in the mood for something different. The interior is small and not good for large groups. I've eaten here once and other times just order takeaway. $3 tacos can't be beat!  Definitely in my top ten for local tacos."}
{"text":"I had their vegan taco here and I wasn't that impressed.   The taco was only black beans, some lettuce and tomato. It was not that flavorful and very basic. I could've made it at home! The prices are pretty good but they need to start adding something new to their vegan tacos. They're just not original."}
{"text":"The simplicity of a good taco shop is something that is often overlooked. Doce holds a reputable name within the college and South Side community with its small, yet pleasing variety of $3.00 tacos and Mexican sodas. I was impressed by the quality of the food, the friendliness of the wait staff, and the cozy bar vibe. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So simple, yet so good. Simple is not bad yinz guyz... prime example here! Five different tacos to choose from and a handful of sides. I tried the carnitas and carne molida and both were fantastic. You also get the choice of a flour or corn tortilla... which I'm sure you authentic Mexican food seekers will like!   Just thinking about them makes me hungry! I probably could have done one more if I didn't order up a side of black beans. And it's not just black beans... it's black beans topped with cheese and salsa.   I don't think you could squeeze in anything else in this shop because it's TINY! They have a bar to sit around for probably around 10ish people, so don't come here with a big group... unless you're taking your tacos to go!   All tacos are $3 and sides $2 which is a TOTAL steal! If I was in the South Side everyday, this could become a problem (but is that a bad thing!?)!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me a few tacos and a bottle of white wine to keep me company during an extra long work day that required me to be there thru dinner. She had been craving tacos, so asked which proteins I wanted for my two tacos. I chose chicken and pork. It was my first time eating Doce Tacos take out and I was very excited as they have always been delicious on site.   Was it because I was sober that they weren't as good as I remembered them to be? The corn tortilla shells were good, the toppings fresh and flavorful, but both the chicken and pork were dry and not good. The meats were served in nice portions in the tacos , and should have been the star of the show. Sadly, no. I will give them another chance and go back to eat a few tacos after a few strong drinks to see if it helps their review.  I gave them three stars because they have always been good before so I have not written them off."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Nice people. Better options. Their pop is tasty too. Clearly I've never been let down.  Plus they have a great selection of hot sauces, so you can't go wrong with having Taco Tuesdays at this joint."}
{"text":"These tacos are out of this world! By far my favorite taco spot in the Burgh! Also the service is amazing! Ashley and Sean are so sweet to me everytime always greeting me with a how are you and a smile! If you haven't been here you need to get down here and try these fire tacos!!!! Plus the owner Andy is a fucking gentleman and a scholar, I really hope he continues to open amazing businesses like this..."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot! The food is quick, affordable, and delicious. It's the perfect place to take a brief intermission from your South Side excursions. Also they play awesome music like Sublime. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow... Line was long but was worth it! The best taco I ever had! Was with a friend and we ended up going back in line again to get more..."}
{"text":"Great food! The carnitas is so well cooked. Tacos are pricy but everything else is cheap so it balances out."}
{"text":"When it comes to tacos, man this place got it right.  Always fresh products, packed with flavors. Presentation is pretty good for a taco. Service is great. My always stop by place for tacos. Give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"This place needs to be bigger! Yummy tacos, tender meat, flavorful and great prices! The workers were very accommodating to our young children too! My only complaint would be the nachos, they were to smothered in cheese sauce which made them super soggy. Some people might like that but I wasn't a fan..."}
{"text":"The menu looks busy at first but is simple enough to easily understand the choices of ingredients.   I went with the carnitas tacos with corn tortillas and no pico de gallo. I asked the waitress if my tacos could go light on the mexican slaw when a young chef cheerfully insisted that I should go with the usual amount since it's so good. And omg it was.   The meat was a little dry in my opinion but the lime given along with the slaw added enough moisture to make up for it and the flavors were just mouthwatering.   I ordered 2 tacos but I wish I had the stomach for more. They got nice music in my personal opinion.  They use the electronic-tip choice for when you pay, which I'm not a huge fan of because that's before the experience so how will I know if the food and employees are above and beyond like this! Next time I'll leave a tip for sure!"}
{"text":"J and I frequently attend this small Southside joint when we are in the mood for tacos. The tacos are delicious here with very flavorful ingredients. The last time we went, I ordered two chicken tacos and J ordered two beef tacos. Each taco is $3, so two tacos each is filling and cost effective. The cooks are very nice and cook your food quickly, despite having a crowd. We definitely recommend this place for a quick bite to eat or for every Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"I was in town playing music and saw this pop up on Yelp so I decided to check it out since I absolutely love tacos. It was definitely the right choice.   But before I talk about food, I kind of want to give it a 4 star only because of how small the location was. It seems popular and the food is very good, so I would imagine it's pretty crowded more often than not. I like sitting down to eat and I ended up having to stand outside and eat over my to go container unfortunately. Hopefully they can expand to a larger location because the food definitely made up for it.  Onto the tacos.. The portions were very fair for a taco spot. Normally i go for 3 tacos, but two was more than filling. I went for pollo and carnitas and they were both very tasty and surely a little more unique than your standard street taco because of the ingredients. The chicken taco had avacado and a cholula cream drizzle and the carnitas had a Mexican slaw; and they both came with cheese, pico, cilantro, and lime. I also really enjoy yellow corn tortillas over white corn, so that was a great little surprise. They also had a vegan option available along with a walking taco in a Doritos bag. Pretty awesome!   If you are in the area and overwhelmed with all of the choices nearby, this is a great quick or late night option."}
{"text":"Their pork nachos are the best! I crave them so much and will get them at other places but nothing compares to them. At first I was not too sure because I am picky but boy was I wrong! They were a great size for me and my boyfriend ended up sharing them with me after he ate all of his tacos. The lady was so nice to us and kept checking on us as well. Defiantly will go back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Interior is tight but the food is always great.  Not a place to sit down to eat and linger.  Think street food in a store front and you'll fall in love. Serve is somewhat fast despite the place always being slammed with orders.   The menu has staples but at the same time there is almost always something innovating simmering to be served up for the day."}
