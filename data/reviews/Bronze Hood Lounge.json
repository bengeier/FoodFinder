{"text":"Worse fish sandwich ever, Italian breadcrumbs? Slow service, no drinks until my soup came, actually mushroom soup was excellent, won't order the fish again, unless it's beer battered like it should be"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice establishment.  The prices are good and nice atmosphere but just feel the bar is a bit bright for my taste..    The food and service is great and restrooms are clean.   Parking can be a problem on a Friday or Saturday night.."}
{"text":"We used to visit the old digs about a 1/2 mile down the road.  There was a mysterious fire there about a year and a half ago, and they moved to the new place in a laundry mat back in January.  Were were frequent visitors to the old place, but here are my issues with the new place...  1. Parking...It seems as if the Bronze Hood has irritated some of its neighbors in regards of parking.  The parking has been an issue to the point a laundry mat has placed jersey barriers so people do not park there.  I guess towing has also been an issue!  2. Food.: Service was an issue at the old place.  Service has improved dramatically.  The venue itself has improved.  We ate there twice when it reopened.  First we had wings.  The wings were overcooked.  The \"fresh cut fries\" were frozen at some point and were beyond bland!  We got \"gravy\" with them which was not worth the extra dollar.  Gravy was bland.  Round two, I had the breaded chicken sandwich I used to love on Mancini bread.  I got an OK chicken sandwich on cold bread.  They couldn't even be bothered to toast it.    The food was just average and would prefer to frequent elsewhere.  They have a great draft selection, and a laid back environment, I just wish their food didn't dip in quality with the move!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun! Good drinks and fun atmosphere! We will definitely be back!  The owners personally make sure you are taken care of!"}
{"text":"Poor service,  subpar food,  hard to park. .... save your time and money and go else where."}
{"text":"This is your go-to neighborhood dive spot with cheap drinks, decent food, and friendly staff. I like to come here with my parents as they're not big fans of fancy restaurants. The casual atmosphere is right up their alley - and they have been more than satisfied with each visit. I'm a big fan of the sandwiches (particularly the whaler during lent) but my parents love to split the stuffed pepper appetizer and wings.   Beer selection is good! Usually with larger selections some of the beers are overpriced, but that's not the case here. I don't live close enough for it to be a \"going out\" place for me, but I could see it being really fun for the local crowd. I'll continue to come here for lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Poor service and awful food.  I ordered a take out Caesar salad with grilled salmon and received three pieces of bitter romaine lettuce and a burnt piece of frozen salmon.  Unfortunately not even the two drops of dressing could mask the flavor.  I don't like to write bad reviews because everyone has different tastes, but this was just a poor excuse for a FOURTEEN dollar salad.  Not to mention the server taking my order was rude and screaming over the phone.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We have frequented this place a few times in the past few months. On the first visit, we were encouraged by the server to order the JUMBO wings, as they are \"awesome\".  They were 1/2 wings, and certainly NOT Jumbo  ????  and were far from awesome. They were overcooked and dried out.  Have gone a few times since, and every time there, found that the staff in not attentive, and could not care less about dirty dishes and empty glasses sitting in front of their customers. They leave it there, don't refill drinks unless asked.   The food has not gotten any better. Their soups are tasteless, the burgers dry and overcooked, chili is thick and tastes burnt.  Their antipasta salads are good, large, but, it depends on what cook is there, clearly. The food is inconsistent, but for the most part the only thing to eat there is a salad.  Nothing, absolutely nothing else has been good, and we have tried a few things on the menu.    The best is that farce that they have \"country line dancing\" on Thursdays.  They post on their windows and walls that they have \"country line dancing with lessons at 7pm\". Last week the \"instructor/DJ\" didn't even show up.  Tonight, she was there with 3 of her own friends, and had a personal dance party with them.  She announced nothing, taught nothing, and didn't \"own\" her dance floor. They all just danced together, not engaging their audience.  It was pathetic.  She had no following whatsoever. In past weeks, having inquired with the servers about this Thursday country dance night, the servers ALL said, either \"I don't know anything about it, because I don't work on Thursdays\", or \"Oh, I don't know anything about it...we have country night on Thursdays??\"  LOL....now I can see why they had no idea about it, as it leaves no impression on anyone, well, maybe a bad one.  Sad...I had high hopes for this place.  Nice environment, but service sucks, but not as much as the food. Boo"}
{"text":"We love the hood!  We go there often and have always had a great time. Parking blows but it is what it is. The wings are awesome and we love their kettle cooked chips with French onion dip. Beers are ice cold and the staff is friendly and remembers your orders when you come back. Gets packed on weekends and during games but food is always great as is service."}
{"text":"We just left this place for the last time.   The bartender at lunch is very smug, short, and rude she has ZERO personality and has no idea what customer service is. The food is pretty good most times. This is one of many opportunities we have given this place.  Today was the final nail in this coffin."}
{"text":"More than a bar!  I would argue best fish in town(for Pittsburgh that is saying a lot).  I have eaten nearly everything on menu and have not been let down.  Portions are more than generous.  Very clean, good drink specials- not sure what there is not to like?!?!  Recommendations: mushroom soup (hearty and rich), fish sandwich (whaler), fried appetizer platter, stuffed peppers, and their pizza are some of my favorites."}
{"text":"We decided to go here one day for lunch for something different.  The reviews looked decent, so what the heck.  Where to begin.   I was very disappointed.   One thing I will preface my review with was that they were very busy.  It was lunch time and there was a lot of take-out going on.  The service was quite slow, slow to bring menus, slow to get drinks, just very slow in general.  I ordered the Chedder Bacon Chicken sandwich.   It was very dry and had no flavor to it.   I asked to substitute my fries for their mac and cheese.    When my food came out my mac and cheese was missing.    After flagging our server down and asking for my side it came out.    The mac seemed like they took a box of craft mac and cheese and added about 5 extra boxes of noodles.   It had no flavor whatsoever.   Then the check comes and there is an up-charge of $2.25 for this disgusting mac and cheese that I didn't eat.   Our server never mentioned an up-charge.    She was so slow to begin with, I didn't have time to argue over the check.  My co-worker had a burger cooked medium rare and fries.   The burger was charred to the core and the fries were totally inediable.  I tried one and spat it out.  I most certainly will not be visiting this place again.   $15 for a very poor sandwich at lunch is a bit much."}
{"text":"Great place for a couple beers and good food. They have a variety of food options, and everything I've had to eat has been good. The wings are excellent, and the shrimp entree is good too.  The main highlight is the beer selection. Everything you would ever want. I try to keep up, but there's always something I've never heard of on tap.   It can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, but I've never had bad service.  Parking is the only real problem. Too many people for not enough spots."}
{"text":"Each time I've come here the waitress has been incredibly rude. It's really unfortunate because I really like this place. I hope and pray each time that she's not our waitress, but I'm almost positive she's the only waitress there.   We go every week for trivia night and order a ton of food and drinks for our group. She acts like she can't be bothered by our presence. She quite literally throws napkins and straws at us because she can't bother to spend her precious seconds at our table. She even threw a glass of water at us and it spilled all over the table. You can also forget about getting a refill on anything, so make sure you don't drink too fast.   The food is okay and the bartender is really nice. I recommend staying far away from this place simply because of her poor service. If they didn't have trivia night I would never come back."}
{"text":"Been to Bronze Hood in past had ok experiences this last time on a Friday which gets a little break as it was busy and we had 10 people. Had to hunt the waitress down to take drink order and appetizer order food runner brought out meals stood there and asked \"who ordered what\"  Food was not overly hot not undercooked but not hot will think twice before going back."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday evening about 6pm. This is a new location, so it is modern and clean. There are 7 televisions at the bar, and another 5 televisions scattered throughout the restaurant.   I ordered a Pittsburgh Steak & Cheese, a 22oz Budweiser, and a Coke. Total came to $14 + tip (reasonable price). The sandwich was okay, but nothing to write home about. The menu was your typical bar/pub food - mainly sandwiches. One thing I found interesting was that sandwiches are served with potato chips (instead of fries). They have 20 beers on tap, and a full bar.   The bar has space for about 25 people, and their are hi-top and low-top tables available as well (for another 75 people or so). The night I went, there were about 15 patrons at the establishment. There were 2 bar tenders on duty that night, and they did an excellent job all around.   Parking can be a little tricky - especially during peak hours (fri/sat nights). There are only about 30-40 parking spaces....and since this restaurant can hold nearly 100 people, that sounds like trouble to me. There are signs on the front door warning patrons not to park at TJ's Deli Mart or the laundrymat next door...or they will have your car towed. From this, it is reasonable to assume that parking has been an issue and people have had cars towed s- watch out.   Nice little place overall, but nothing to get too excited about."}
{"text":"I think the food is consistently good here. The fish sandwich is always good and my favorite. I saw some other reviews not liking the Mac n cheese but I think it's just a matter of opinion. It's nothing fancy but it's good and I think it's quite good. Service is usually ok and today the lady was right on point. So 4 stars for good food, nice size portions, and good service"}
{"text":"Massive improvement from the old diggs. Super parking, great inside. Food rocks and the screens are right there for sports events. Bring the whole family!"}
{"text":"I love it here. It's hard to find a good, original place to eat in Robinson but this place definitely takes the cake- the chips are homemade and are so delicious. The prices are great and the portions are huge! The salads are massive (get the buffalo chicken) and the sandwiches are kickass too (get the Steuben Reuben or the fish). Seriously the best place to eat in Robinson, and all of the waitstaff is super friendly!!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. The newer location is nice and more open. We always eat in the dining room.  The house salad that comes with the meal os full of nice leafy greens ( not that useless iceberg). The homeade balsamic is terrific. I enjoy the added mozerella crumbles on the top.    My favorite entree is the chocken basilico. A generous portion of moist tender chicken breast is smothered in a light basil white wine sauce. The sauce is not overpowering, just the right taste. The only complaint is that it needs a bit of salt. I would rather salt it myself, than have it too salt. The sauce also is loaded with mushrooms for an added taste.  I tried the chicken marsala last night and was very impressed.  This dish also have a generous portion of mushrooms and a delicious marsala wine sauce.    The meals come with potato, vegatable or pasta. I always choose the pasta with oil and garlic. They do it so well there, probably because they used good olive oil. I have tried the desserts, because the entrees are so filling.   Sometimes the bar next door can get a bit loud. They have several televisions to watch any games on.  Parking can be abit tough when its crowded, but its worth the fight. Live on Bronze hood."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise the Bronze Hood was. I've probably passed this place no less than a thousand times and thought \"I should try that place\" but just recently stopped in.   Don't let the location (attached to a laundromat) deter you. It's super spacious, well lit, and clean inside. They have a full menu - we got a fish sandwich (huge), clam strips, wings, and a calzone - and they also have a great beer selection with great local options.  The bartender was super busy but when he slowed down a bit he stopped to chat with us, and tell us a little about the bar and it's \"local celebrity\" patrons. When the food came, they mentioned that the original calzone was burnt, so they were remaking it. Honest and apologetic- and that's all we were looking for. The food was above average for bar food.  They also have a quarter-pusher game, which will have me coming back time and time again. I'm addicted to those things!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, poor service and the waitress(who keeps sitting next to me) smells like a fireplace and has her belly hanging out GROSS It took 35 minutes to get a beer. Soup was cold. Don't waste your time gets one star which is two to many"}
{"text":"Average food and service. Have tried a number of their pub food favorites: pizza, stuffed peppers, sandwiches. All OK. Atmosphere is better than a chain restaurant and friendly enough. Like the big wrap around bar, where you can eat if you're on your own. Parking spots can be scarce at peak hours."}
