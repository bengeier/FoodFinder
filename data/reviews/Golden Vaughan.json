{"text":"Great food! Came here once during vacation and I love the BBQ duck, especially the General Tao and bubble tea they have. Came right after wonderland and was looking for a great Chinese place in the area. Excited and looking forward to coming back again :) I would recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Cantonese chow mein - food poisoning.  Maybe because it was mid afternoon and this dish involves so many different kinds of meats and they cut a few corners on some if them?  Either way, I could tell right away that a few of them weren't fresh, i just didn't know how bad they really were until later.  Last weeks BBQ pork slices?  Rancid chicken?  Check, check.  Maybe their other dishes are awesome?  I will never know, since I won't ever be returning.  This place had a high rating on urbanspoon too."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area !!! It is a must try if in the area !! Owner is very nice guy and very funny !"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's the est for takeaway in Vaughan. The spicy chicken wings, and the roti prantha with beef and peppers are just as authentic as my mother in laws and she is Malaysian and loves it!"}
{"text":"As it was Labour Day, I decided to take my co-worker for a Labour Day Lunch to celebrate Labour Day for all those workers that worked this day.  I just drove around as he said NO to Swiss Chalet, NO to Harvey's, NO to Pho until this Chinese Restaurant showed up.  Chinese is super RARE in this part of the Wood(bridge).

Walking to the door we were followed by this man while I took a photo of the place.  He was the SOLE waiter today and spoke Cantonese as we chatted about all types of stuff as no one else was there at 1 pm.  

He showed us the $6.99 Combo items where my co-worker got Beef & Mixed Veges w/Black Bean Sauce while I had the Beef & Bitter Melon w/Black Bean Sauce.  It comes with your choice of Soft Drink or Spring Roll.

This place looks like it CATERS to the local Canadians but the menu looks very traditional Cantonese.  It rivals Peaktop which is very nearby with a similar Menu and pricing structure.  Peaktop has Dim Sum though but not a Lunch Special.

It also rivals Maple Dragon in terms of the Combination Special although not as inexpensive($5.25) but taste less oily in general and has much better dine-in area plus a LCD to watch some news."}
{"text":"Excellent food !

I've only dined in-house twice...but have ordered and picked up food on numerous occasions.

Love the spicy Malaysian noodles.....nice heat and delicious. It has shrimp (I usually order it without the shrimp as I've had a bad experience with it......not here but at another restaurant),  shredded pork, noodles, spices...but be forewarned...if you ask for it spicy...it will be spicy. Not for the faint of heart.....

General Tao chicken is unlike anything I've ordered elsewhere...it is amazing here...this dish alone keeps me coming back.

The restaurant is sort of a blend of Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodian, southeast Asia and I have yet to find a dish that I don't like or wouldn't order again.

It is, by far, the best place in my area for this type of cuisine."}
