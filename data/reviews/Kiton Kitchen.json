{"text":"This place is very strange to me, a restaurant that looks and smells like a butcher shop. The table was very sticky and the place was so dark. During my visit, I was also in the bathroom, which was very filthy. About food? I couldn't finish the plate, that means it all. Definitely a one-time experience, I will not go back there again."}
{"text":"If you like Israeli/Middle Eastern food, this is the restaurant for you. It's not fancy, but the food is divine!

We tried a little bit of a lot of menu items, and all were served piping hot or fridge cold. From the homemade hummus and baba ganoush to the chicken shawarma and kebabs, everything tastes delicious. 

Try it, you'll like it, and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Shawarma is so delicious.
Great service.
And you must try it if you visit in town..!!"}
{"text":"I had the beef and chicken kabob combo today, it was OUTSTANDING!  Also loved the potato salad.  Great family friendly place with all fresh ingredients made in-house.  This was my second visit, i will be back again and again."}
{"text":"So far my food is not bad . ...I had the shawarma chicken pita and the flavor was excellent, except I found a few pieces of the chicken in there was still raw and hopefully I don't get sick from it so I take the rest home to microwave to fully cooked my chicken before I finished it. On the other hand, my uncle's plate of chicken kabob and shish Kafta beef was bland in flavor and not grilled, so will not order kabob plate but will definitely order the chicken shawarma again."}
{"text":"We walked into this establishment for the first time me and my girlfriend, we did ask the hostess to order our meal, the meal she gave us was very good very filling and was a really nice plate, place was very clean atmosphere very nice, I would recommend this place to anyone we will come back again to try a different dish"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for lunch yesterday purely by accident.  So glad we did.  The people were friendly and the food was fabulous.  We split a combo plate special that had kafta kebab and chicken kebab my husband ordered an additional beef kebab....this was on a plate with rice, three salads, hummus, two fresh warm flat bread oh and three different sauces ....spicy...that was a little spicy, but very good, garlic, and tahini. This was way more food than we were expecting for about $23 including bottled water.  The cashier brought our food to the table, and was extremely nice to us, giving us an extra plate, cups for our water, a small tray with olives, peppers and beets before our meal was ready and to go box when we were ready to leave.  The chef was also friendly asking how we liked the food and thanking us as we were leaving. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in town. It is always is in and out. It is a hidden gem. People don't know about it. So it always empty. But the food is unbelievable. The mix plate is heaven on earth and they have the best Babakhanouch ever"}
{"text":"I have been her 2x and will continue coming here. The first time I got the chicken box this time I got the beef kafta pita. Both times the food was too much for me but it's so amazing. It's family owned and I feel like family when I come here. Everyone is so friendly and I feel as though I belong there. They have fresh food, great service and wonderful smiles. The garlic sauce is delicious, I'm addicted. 

There's nothing I can ask for that they don't have. Great food Service and even more they are warm. I'll be back again and again and plan on bringing more people with me."}
{"text":"Their Lintel soup and rice is the best!  A must try.  Cute atmosphere and warm friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch with a friend. We both got the falafel pita and garlic fries. It was one of the best falafel I've had in town. The fries were also delicious, heavy on the garlic, and kinda smoky. I think might've been from paprika. Was surprised the place wasn't more crowded but we came in the early evening on a Thursday. Atmosphere is very casual. Service was prompt!  Can't wait to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Falafel, shawarma, hummus, and more- Kiton Kitchen has all your favorite Mediterranean specialties, served out of the former Al's Beef spot on the west side. Menu is pretty expansive with large portions and reasonable prices, and the cook in particular is super sweet.

Favorite thing I've had here so far is the Chicken Shawarma Plus- a giant platter of pita, chicken cooked with onions, rice or fries, plus fresh salads, hummus, and sauces. Definitely get the garlic and spicy sauces on the side, they're both great and made in house. The chicken is a huge portion and so flavorful, made with juicy thigh meat. 

Their falafel pita was somewhat disappointing- cut in half and torn, with fairly flavorless falafel and missing the additional condiments I'd requested. I'd prefer the more traditional stuffed presentation, which I may request on another visit. Maybe order carefully, or chalk it up to a new business working out the kinks in the kitchen. Most recently, I tried their chicken soup, which is perfect for the cooler weather and packed with protein and vegetables!"}
{"text":"It's okay, chickpeas blows them off the map in friendliness, flavor
and portions. I was still hungry after eating there and the prices are high."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Israeli Mediterranean restaurant.  It's the true taste of Israel in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Shawarma in pita is AHHMAZING! Nice little family place  food is great, staff is even better."}
{"text":"This is far most the worst middle eastern food place I have every eaten! Nasty  stay away. This place will not last in business. Place is always empty. Brought food for my workers (6 people), and every single person was in the restroom all day long. We got chicken shawarma which was covered in curry! What the hell! Why? Over priced for the nasty food."}
{"text":"We went here on the recommendation of other Yelp reviews and thought it was awful.  We were the only ones in the place and it was about 6:30 PM.  As we were leaving around 7PM they were closing even though their sign said they are open until  8 every night.  We ordered a chicken pita and a lamb pita and there was more salad than neat.  The tahini sauce had a bitter taste and the hummus left a lot to be desired.  They said they have a large lunch crowd but I cannot see this place staying in business for very long."}
{"text":"Meh. Much better options out there. Went at like 2:30 pm on a weekday and food tasted like it had been sitting there for a few days. The reviewer who said they don't know how to use spices was absolutely on point. Service was meh too. Won't be back."}
{"text":"They're okay. I liked the pickled veggies and their hummus is smooth. Chicken was a good flavor. The rice was cool. I think I'm expecting more flavor scores on their chicken and rice though. I think some Mediterranean spices were not as prominent as most or other shawarma places have it. Nice portions. I enjoyed my meal cuz it made me full. Sure to try them again if they're on my route. Maybe a beef platter..."}
{"text":"Newly opened in Las Vegas. Best Lebanese food you can get for your buck. Best baba ghannouch and the hummus is smooth like butter. Definitely a must if you are into middle Eastern cuisine. 
Love it! Faouzi makes it palestinien style and it is sooo sooo good"}
{"text":"Hi I went  here with  my girlfriend  while we were car shopping  since it's close to the dealerships which seemed nice, the food was order when it came the meat was raw the  bread  was hard  even the soda had a bad taste like it was watered down  we  decided to order a  few  more Things and  thinking maybe it was just what we ordered and all of it had a bad taste and wasn't even prepared properly we went home that night my girlfriend was feeling extremely sick and then  in the morning I took her to the doctor because she vomited  all night long  she had food poising . I go to many established restaurants in  our city's and this place is by far the worst place I have ever  been too my rating for this restaurant is a 0 please save yourself the extra pain and suffering we went through do not eat here !!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I have to say the food is really good. Authentic Israeli food. Seems like it's family run and that explains the excellent food. As for the decor it could be better that's why I knocks off a star. There was a fast food place here at one time and it looks like it did before. Otherwise 5 stars for me!

Update:

Ever since the main chef left this place hasn't been the same. Food went downhill immediately. Started using tortilla for lafa pita!

Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it was amazing! Had the chicken shawarma box with rice. Gigantic portions and inexpensive. Looking forward to trying more menu items."}
{"text":"Been there 5 times in the last two weeks, each time i ate something else from the menu and everything single thing was amazing!!!
Good prices as well as the friendly staff."}
{"text":"We just had lunch here (8.17.17). It was perfect. I got the chicken shawarma plate, my friends got the chicken shawarma pita and the mixed plate. Everyone was delighted. The shawarma came with tahini, jasmine rice, onions, pita, and hummus Pictures attached."}
{"text":"Authentic Mediterranean food!!! My job requires me to go to the Middle East on occasions so I know a little bit about Mediterranean food.  The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  My sons enjoyed the chicken shawarma box and the beef kabobs were delicious.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"They have GREAT lunch specials (11am - 3pm) --  $9.95 for an enormous plate of deliciousness, this has become one of my favorite lunch places! I usually order the Chicken Kabob (dark meat) plate, which comes with rice, hummus, salad, and a pita bread. Their chicken kabob is super juicy and flavorful. It's my favorite on the menu so far. You can also substitute the hummus with baba ganoush, which is WOW, BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Since the portions are so big and I have a tiny stomach, I usually only finish half of my plate, but the baba ganoush, I always eat every last bit of it!
Also, the staff is really nice and friendly! They're starting to recognize me now after going here for lunch at least 5 times over the last month. Will definitely be going back regularly."}
{"text":"I ordered 6 pcs. of falafal and hummas to go. When I got home I was very disappointed the falafal didn't taste anything like I had before, it smelled rancid, flavorless and very small in size. The hummas didn't have any flavor of olive oil, garlic and lemon. That's probably why they don't have any customer."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! The atmosphere is clean and well kept,you know the food is fresh. Falafael was my dish and it was tasty"}
{"text":"Maybe if the family stopped fighting, they could clean up the joint!  We left our food and walked out."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food and very friendly staff. Obviously a family owned restaurant, they weren't too busy during dinner time, which I hope to change with this review. We ordered the kabob plate which was delicious and plentiful. The food was fresh and looked beautiful. We will go back."}
{"text":"This by far my favorite go to restaurant for lunch and as well I bring my family here. The atmosphere is amazing and the staff is wonderful. I recommend this Mediterranean cuisine to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Stopped on today for lunch. We love Mediterranean food and the retro diner look was appealing, so we gave it a try and we are so glad we did. 

My friend got the beef kafta plate and I was not hungry so I got the baba ganoush. They  gave us a plate of pickles and olives that were just fabulous. The kafta was freshly grilled, beautifully spiced and the plate came with all kinds of stuff. Pilaf, hummus, like 3 kinds of salads and homemade pickles. 

My baba ganoush was the real thing. I could taste the smokiness of the eggplant that is the hallmark of real baba ganoush. Warm fluffy pita. 

The staff was wonderful. The cooking was going on right there so you could see how freshly made it was. 

I urge you to try Kiton Kitchen, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Incredible & tasty 
Every single bite was delicious
Extremely clean & friendly
The cook was very sweet and funny 
I'll be back very soon"}
