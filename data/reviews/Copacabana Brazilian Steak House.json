{"text":"Went here the other night. The service was very good.  There were always asking if I wanted more.  Food was okay.  To much food really.  Loved the steak.  The atmosphere was really cool and I loved the grilled pineapple.  Chicken was just ok.  Will probably come again."}
{"text":"First off I want to say, don't go here with large group. Theres a lot of other great places to eat in the city. I planned a surprise birthday party here for my boyfriend. But the problems began weeks before our reservations. After making the reservation over the phone, I get an email containing a \"contract\". You have to fill it out and put down a credit card number when you have a party of 12+. I fill it out and email it back. I get no reply or phone call to tell me if they received it. I called constantly for 3 days, leaving a bunch of voicemails. Finally someone decided to pick up on the third day. They tell me they have to ask the manager but he was in a meeting. Lovely, more time waiting. Of course they don't bother calling back, so I call the next day and the lady tells me she has to ask the manager. I told her I wasn't getting off the phone just to play telephone tag, she needed to either put him on the phone or ask him herself right away. So I'm assuming she spoke to him and I had to resend the contract to his email address. Thanks for the heads up; it would've been nice if it said that in the contract. So I emailed it to him. Then they tell you you have to call the day before to confirm the number of people attending because if more then one person doesn't show up and are included in that final number, you have to pay for them anyways. Stupidest rule ive ever heard of. So if more then one person bails on you last minute, you're stuck paying for them. So I call the day before, of course no one answers so I left a message. But since it's clear they don't check their messages, I called a few hours later and actually got someone on the phone. I told her I was confirming the number of guests for my party and she asks \"is it still 20?\" (which was the original number when I made the reservations weeks ago) I told her no it changed to 13, I had already called earlier and left a message. Finally the day comes, and it only got worse. Me and a few of the guests arrived at 7:10, a bit before our reservations for 7:30. They tell me my table for 12 is ready. Yeah, I called and confirmed 13 but clearly they don't listen. Anyways, we sit down and wait for the remaining guests. In a matter of half an hour, 4 different people came up to tell me that we better hurry up because we only have the table till 9:30. A heads up would've been nice but clearly they don't believe in courtesy. 3 minutes before the birthday boy walks in the door, the owner comes up and tells me we need to hurry up and eat because we have to leave by 9:30.  They might as well just have shoved us out the door.   Moral of the story, going with a few people would probably give you the most you can get out of this place, but if you're looking to go with a large group, stay far far away. The food was probably the only good thing about my experience there."}
{"text":"It just doesn't disappoint. I try to go as often as I can. Staff is nice,  professional and fast. Everything is good, but my favourite meats are the chimichurri and the dryrub...Looking foward to going back. Try to go on a weekday. Weekends are superbusy and they dont take reservations for less than 6 people."}
{"text":"Live music performances daily during Winterlicious. There are all kinds of meat I cannot even know all their names. They even have roast pineapples."}
{"text":"Four stars is generous. You get what you pay for. $50 for good food, friendly service and an overly full stomach. My favorites were actually at the buffet section: lasagna, huge variety of salads and cream corn.  The Parmesan chicken, salmon and pineapple were also fantastic."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant and my overall experience was really good. It reminded me of when I was in the Dominican Republic. The food was great. The service was great. The entertainment was good. Very good vibes. The only thing I didn't like when was the dancers came dancing around the diners. I get they want to include people with the experience but I didn't like someone's body sweat possibly flying into my food. Another thing I didn't like was when the performance was on the music was really loud. I could barely hear the others at my table. Otherwise it was really enjoyable. I definitely recommend it. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here with family. All meats were very good and I have been to brazilian steakhouses in nyc, newark and philadephia to compare. Would go here again in a heartbeat.  Only minor surprise was no yucca powder.   Live music was good but we sat far away so we could talk."}
{"text":"Double date at Copacabana with a pair of close friends yesterday and it was such a good time! The restaurant serves up ayce meat varying from different seasoned steaks, chicken and pork. They also offer a mini buffet/salad bar as an appetizer option, nothing too fancy just your average pasta, potatoes, greens etc. As for the steaks, you'll have servers walking around with sticks of meat coming around to offer you a chunk, pretty awesome as you get to try a bit of everything. Most of the meats were really good and well seasoned as they were able to showcase different flavours. I was surprised at how well done their chicken was, very moist. Recommended meats to try are the garlic sirloin and top sirloin. They usually bring the same meats around repeatedly so if there's a specific meat you wanted to try that's listed on their menu, you can put out a special request. They also offer desserts after you've finished pigging out and that includes their grilled cinnamon pineapple and deep fried banana which were both delicious!  I can definitely say their food was good but the service of the workers were just below average as they didn't seem friendly or happy with their job - good accommodations but lack of social interactions.  Overall a great dining experience that I would recommend as a good date night!"}
{"text":"I've been to Brazilian steak houses in the US (Churasscaria Plataforma and Texas de Brazil). And it's clear that Toronto, particularly Copacobana needs competition. Based on our most recent dinner at the Eglinton St. E. location, it will be our last visit. However, we will continue to visit the Niagara Falls location which needs to stay competitive with Brasa.  We were relegated to a 4:30 pm reservation as they indicated that was the only seating available for our party of six. To be fair, we made the reservation three days prior so I get it. But when we arrived at 4:20 pm (they even called two hours prior to make sure we weren't going to be late), there were only six other people seated. Our party of six was to be seated at the table closest to the front door but we questioned the woman seating us whether the carvers would get to us if we had that table and she assured us we would. She also reminded us of the two hour seating limit and we told her we understood.  Issues  * So even though we arrived EARLY for our 4:30 pm seating the first carver didn't appear until 4:55 pm.  * Given the location of our table, we never made the first round cut ... we were served our meats 5 - 10 minutes after other tables * Washrooms remind me of Spadina China Town Chinese Restaurants ... they seriously need a coat of paint and refinishing * our server was nice enough but she was slow ... to be fair to her, the restaurant probably did not have enough servers on the floor for our seating time * can you believe we left after our 2 hour seating still hungry ... that's the result of the slow stream of meat and the poor table location we were given  The Good  * as always, the meat was very well cooked and tasty.  * the show is always a treat  Conclusion  * as noted above, we won't visit again and we'd go out of our way to tell people not to visit the Toronto location because it's not a cheap night out and you want to enjoy the entire experience if you're spending that amount of money."}
{"text":"the servers should have rollerblades on, but than again with those insanely sharp knifes, that might not be a good idea.  all kidding aside, the service was really good.  i thought, with winterlicious happening, service would be compromised.  it was not the case at all.  from the moment we stepped in, service was execptional.    i have to say, this place is haven for meat lovers.  not much to complain at all.  the only thing was, any meat that involved cheese in it, was pretty salty.  I like salt... a lot, but after eating the meats that was covered in parmesan cheese, I finished the bottle of water that was on the table.  the fried little bananas is a must eat, don't leave without eating them.    will I come back... definitely."}
{"text":"Though I've heard great things about this place, I wasn't expecting much as a place with an unlimited amount of meat on massive skewers just doesn't seem right but this place was oh so right.  Delicious.  The salad/carb bar had a great selection.  My favourite salads were the mixed green salad with a light dressing, avocado(!) & mango.  I also liked the fried yuka and roasted potatoes  (I love potatoes).  The meats come out at random and lures you into meat gluttony.  Surprisingly all the meats were well cooked and even the salmon that comes on the skewer.  We all loved it and the waiters were accommodating when we wanted the lamb chops & pineapples which just didn't seem to come our way after over an hour.  Corn bread (a hit with everyone), cheese bread (meh - more like super dense cheese dough) and fried bananas (deep fried in a cinnamon & nutmeg coating was FANTASTIC) have to be ordered specifically for the table though it is included in the price.  The grilled pineapple comes coated with cinnamon and it probably the most delicious with the fried bananas. Best dessert ever.  Stuffed."}
{"text":"As i entered the place it was packed. On a friday date night out. Live music and dance was performed. The meat was continuosly taking a while distributing to the tables. Good freindly service but a lil pricey,"}
{"text":"When I found out that I would be going to an all you can eat Brazilian BBQ for dinner one night, my carnivorous side got pretty excited. I don't know of too many places like this, but Copacabana is definitely the most well known Brazilian BBQ that I know of. Everyone who's been there had great things to rave about, so that just added to my anticipation. Bottomless meat for a fixed prix of $35? YES PLEASE!   I arrived a bit earlier than my reservation, and ended up waiting a bit. It was really hot inside the restaurant, probably from all the grilling and the wide open entrance to the patio where all the A/C seeped away. Not too big of a deal because I was nicely distracted by the belly dancing and martial arts performances that were on display for the dinner guests!  For a drink, you must try the \"Caiprinha\" ($9.25). It's the National Brazilian Drink consisting of Cachaca, Muddled Limes and Sugar. It comes in a small little glass but BOY was it strong!  The food is served rodizio style where several servers cycle around each table with spears of meat, and shave you pieces of it if you choose so.  All the meats were perfectly cooked, but a tad too salty for my tasting. The ribs were one of the highlights, and the cheese infused prime rib. Yes you read that right. The cheese was just oozing out of the meat as the server cut it. A must try!  The pinapple, like everyone else says, is AMAZINGGGG. Grilled with a sweet cinnamon sprinkle, it was just delicious. They serve this throughout dinner service, but it's good enough to be dessert!  They also have corn breads, cheese breads, and deep fried bananas which you can order from the waitress (not rodizio style). Quite good as well!  If you're looking for a different type of dining experience, live entertainment, and a place to satisfy your insatiable carnivorous tendencies, I would definitely recommend you try out Copacabana. I will also recommend you eat vegetarian the day after to balance it out..."}
{"text":"Meat on meat on meat!  It was my second time dining at an all-you-can-eat Brazilian grill. It is pricey, but the food, service, and just the whole experience is worth it...once in a blue moon.  Our group of 12 dined at Copacabana to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The moment I stepped inside, I noticed the upbeat atmosphere. It was very lively with a lot of chatter and the music was a little too loud for any decent conversation with the person sitting two seats away. That is part of the whole Brazilian steakhouse experience, I suppose.   The service was excellent. We had made a reservation for 5:30, but due to traffic, half the guests did not arrive until 6:15. The server did everything she could to keep the meats coming until the very end of our meal; it was nice that she took specific requests. There was a bit of a show toward the end of our meal (as they give you a 2-hour limit), where two dancers took the stage for what-seemed-like less than 5 minutes.  There is a small salad bar with some bread and cheese too. Rice, mashed potatoes, butter mushrooms, salmon, mussels (mmm...), and fried casava were available too. Some freshly baked goods like cornbread and cheese buns were brought to the table as well, but I only tried the cornbread and it was really good.  Onto the more important items though... I loved the picanha Brazil, parmesan prime rib, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, flank steak, and Moroccan chicken. I asked for medium rare for all the red meat, and everything tasted amazing.   I was not a fan of the skirt steak dry rub, chimichurri steak, or the beef ribs. All of these were too dry. As for the beef ribs, I expected...ribs, not a roast.   As for dessert, the roasted pineapple is THE best! I helped myself to five big slices at the end of my meal. :) They also have fried bananas. I do not eat bananas, but my friends loved that, too -- not more than the roasted pineapple though. ;)  My boyfriend and I have dined at Brasa in Niagara Falls. He says he enjoyed Brasa a lot more. Bigger, more spacious, larger variety of cold foods to choose from, and the meat never stopped coming. There were many breaks between bites at Copacabana, but it may have been due to our large group size..? But Copacabana is definitely smaller, especially the washrooms..."}
{"text":"This place was very delicious. I am a carnivore and ate for almost two hours straight. The filet Mignon wrapped in bacon was absolutely amazing. The salmon was very moist and not overcooked. I did not get a chance to try very many appetisers since the food came rolling to my table. The only issues that u had with my meal was that everything was on the salty side and they were too stingy with the pineapple. I would have eaten a full pineapple to myself but the kept giving me tiny slices and it felt like they got angry when I asked for more and the slices got thinner and smaller each time I asked :("}
{"text":"The first time I went here was in a December with my office for our holiday party.  At the time I was a vegetarian, so I was stuck with the salad bar at the back and standing up to the jokes from my colleagues.  I was able to keep my spirits lifted with the endless bottles of wine that kept coming to the table.  I have since returned as a meat eater and while I haven't been able to eat everything there, I cannot believe how much meat people can pack in!  Or I can pack in.  Nobody told me about this thing called the \"meat sweats\" when I started eating meat again.  I also was not consuming portions that were large enough for me to experience it.    The amount of meat and variety that they bring out is impressive.  I have never seen beef being cut off from a giant skewer with cheese oozing out of the centre!  They tell you what options they have and will bring it out based on what you want.  Out come the giant hot skewers that they hold next to your plate and cut off slices of meat that land on your plate.    The fried pineapple at the end was quite tasty and they bring as much corn bread out as you want.   The salad bar was ok, but that's not what you come for.  The live entertainment is also another added element of fun.  Make sure you go with an empty stomach and cab money to get you home."}
{"text":"Love the food!  Great dancers and amazing atmosphere!  Try them out for a great Friday/Saturday night.  Its a bit pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Definitely for meat lovers - I wouldn't think of coming to a place like this for anything else. Atmosphere is nice - they usually had live music every time I went and I know they have dancers on occasional nights as well. So for entertainment, that is definitely a plus. The buffet bar is nice, although nothing really too special that cannot be found at any other all you can eat restaurant. The most exciting part is obviously the meat, which constantly cycles around when you flip your circular card (left for you on your table upon arrival) to blue; code for go. They are quite fast, so it is recommended to stack up on a couple varieties of meats before flipping your card to red (code for stop) and enjoying the different tastes.   Be aware that since it is an 'all you can eat' style restaurant, they don't let you take anything home - so if you don't like the taste of a meat do not keep eating it! And do not get too distracted by the buffet table as well; I made that mistake a couple times during my first time or two here.   My only complaints would be that a) you do not get to take anything home (I understand that it is policy, but being able to wrap up those extra 2 cornbread muffins or cheese balls would have been great!), and b) when you request for a meat to be returned to your table, they are rather slow or non responsive at all with that request. Although, I did notice that with my latest visit to the Eglinton location that a server actually came over to our table, took our meat requests, and it was brought out minutes later. So all in all, 4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Was here a while ago , had a most terrible experience in Toronto , posted an review on Yelp , but it never really got published (why?)  was here with a friend that out of town to have a girls dinner , already been here a couple times , think the food was decent for people that like eating meat , and the atmosphere was great . So we wanted to bring our out of town friend here . Food was decent still, but our serve gave us the most terrible service that we would never go back , she started off with giving us a wrong bottle of wine , which is fine , people make mistake , understandable , then just dropping the right bottle of wine and the wine glasses on the table and walk away ?!?! Every Time when we needed something , she just simply ignore us . But she was fine with the table besides us . I have no idea what we did to deserved this kind of service when we are already paying $60 plus per person plus a bottle of wine . She ignored us even when we asked for the the bill . She gave us a feeling that she simply don't care about serving us because we are Asian . At the end we asked for the manager  to tell him what happened , he told us we should've told him earlier, there is nothing he can do now . We were nice enough to still tipped her 15% , but I would advise everyone don't come here , if you expect to get the same value of service that you pay for , I assume downtown location would be better"}
{"text":"Great meats, tasty and well marinated. Juicy and soft. Friend pineapple is a blast.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I've tried several Brazilian stake houses in the past and someone recommended this one.  It's located near Yonge and Eglinton,  fairly busy intersection and currently a lot of construction around do expect lots of traffic. Anyway I came here with my girlfriend since she's never been to a Brazilian stake house so I wanted her to experience one. In the begging the service was good and rhey came around fairly often (for the first 15 minutes) however afterwards it all changed. I don't know what happened but it took people over 10 minutes to come around to our table each time and it was the same guys with the exact same meat we did not want. The food we did get was good, however we spent close to 2 hours because it took so long for people to come around.  I must say in a bit dissapointed."}
{"text":"When Joe sent out his birthday invite and I saw that we were going to an all you can eat meat joint I was SOOOOOO excited!!! I had walked by the Niagara Falls location a few times and I have wanted to try it for the longest time. Let me just say that this place did not disappoint!   The restaurant itself was very nice. It was nicely decorated and it didn't feel too crowded (even with servers walking around with sticks of meat :p). We had a group of 17 people and the restaurant handled all of us exceptionally well. They had a live musician playing and even some Brazilian dancers performed at the end of our night. I was entertained and kept happy throughout the night.   Now lets get down to the food :D. They had a salad/seafood bar that everyone started with. The selection was quite large and everything that I tried was fresh and tasty. It was nothing exceptional but it was nice to have something other than meat and it wasn't cold or stale. Then came all the meat..almost everything that I had was cooked to perfection. All the beef + pork was well seasoned and was full of flavour. The bacon wrapped turkey was to die for as well!! The only meat that they really messed up on was the chicken :( I had the chicken parmesan and the Moroccan chicken and it was way overcooked (tasted like rubber) and it was way too salty. It was a bit of a let down for me seeing as chicken isn't that hard to cook. The desert foods were MIND BLOWING. I must have had 6-10 servings of the grilled pineapple and a few pieces of the deep fried banana :).   The bill for 2 people came out to $110 including taxes and gratuity which in my opinion was a bit over priced but I made sure that I had my moneys worth. I would love to come back in a smaller group that way there will be less time waiting for other people to get their food cut :p"}
{"text":"Loved the environment. Came here for my birthday.  Music was good, dancers were good. Service was great. Meats are tasty. First time coming to a place like this where they come and chop the meats off in front of me, was a fun experience. Will definitely come here again, this time on a more emptier stomach than I had. Felt like I could've eaten, much much more."}
{"text":"To speak about the money that one pays to eat all one can, it is expensive FOR ME. However, the quality of the meat is great and for a special occasion this place has it all! It's like dinner and a show all in one! $40 per person is steep just for food but when you factor into the dancers with their feathery bums and the live tunes, it is quite a good night out! You should make a rezo (reservation) for sure, but you can always tether yourself to a bar stoop and have a drink whilst waiting....It's going to be a fun night! The buffet is tempting and full of great choices, but take heed....the meat is the prize. Have a young man slice you off some of his juicy beef from his rod, or poke your plate  with his pork ....you won't be sorry. When you have filled your face with the succulent  shank of lamb, turn over your coaster, grab another drink and enjoy the sights and sounds of Brasil!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was above average. Plus at the end of our meal there were Brazilian dancers.  I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Went here for the second time and the service was horrible. Our table was constantly missed with the rounds of meat and we had to ask several times to be served. On top of that we kept getting missed with the cheese and corn bread. We had to even ask to be served the pineapple!!! When we asked for service from our waitress she looked annoyed. I won't be back, for the price I would expect to have better service from this establishment. They also charged us $4.00 for water without even telling us that we would be charged. Don't bother going to this location the service sucks, maybe another location would have better service."}
{"text":"We went there for a friend's 40th birthday and had reservations for 15 people. We arrived on-time to the packed restaurant however we're not seated for about 15-20 minutes. The buffet at the back of the restaurant is pretty good with a wide variety of vinegary salads and a few hot items like Mac n cheese, lasagna and curried veggies. The show stopper was the meat- when you could get it. I found that the waiters would runout of meat mid-way through our table but not start back at the same spot after getting more from the kitchen. This left the unlucky few people at the end of the table without anything to eat. We were also brought some cheese buns but they ran out and half of our table went without as they never came back with more. We also felt a bit rushed at the end (despite them starting late) because there was another large party after us.   Most staff seemed to be ok and worked well under pressure (it's a busy place) , but there were some staff who were clearly making it apparent they would rather be somewhere else.   As for the quality of the rodizio meats- they were fantastic and delicious. The grilled pineapple was amazing.   To sum it up- the food is good but the service needs work.  I took off two stars just for that.   I'd suggest trying out a different location before this one to see if the service is any better."}
{"text":"I've heard of great things about this all-you-can-eat place from my sister. My family and I went here for my parents' anniversary. It's really expensive. (Sorry, I don't remember how much it costs; it was my sister who paid the bill LOL) But I just looked it up and it costs $37.99 Sunday-Thursday and $42.99 Friday-Saturday.  You get your side dishes in a self-serving buffet style. I was surprised to see some more expensive ingredients in their side dishes. There were a lot of variety as well: beat salad, mango salad, avocado salad, spinach-radish mix, chickpea/couscous mix, some pasta dish, tomato/onion mix, plain rice, black beans, wild rice, and 10 other dishes I couldn't identify.  After you get your side dish, you sit down at your table and servers will come around with a big piece of meat in a metal skewer. Different servers will be carrying different kind of meat. Each server will then ask you if you want some of the meat they're holding. If you say, \"yes\", they cut off a thing slice from the skewered meat and you use your own tongs to grab that sliced meat. There were over half a dozen meat served. It was an unusual way for me to get my food so it was intimidated at first, but after a while I relaxed and had fun picking and choosing what kind of meat I should eat next!  Here's a list of meat they served us that day: -boneless leg of lamb -cheese stuffed prime rib -chicken drumstick -filet mignon -top sirloin -garlic sirloin -flank steak -chicken breast -picanha brazil -parmessan filet -rib eye -roasted pineapple -sausage -moroccan chicken -chimichurri steak In addition to the list above, they serve suckling pig, salmon, and shrimp on Fridays and Saturdays only.  Their cornbread was amazing! It's not \"authentic\" cornbread, but I prefer their cornbread than the authentic one. Their cornbread was much sweeter than the actual cornbread.  Service was really friendly.   The restaurant was pricey, but I think it's worth to even try it out. For me, it was a new experience and I've been to a lot of buffets. The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Come here if you're looking for a different dining experience. The food was average and consists of lower quality meats that have been overcompensated with seasoning. The buffet has your standard staples of salads, carbs, and some fruits. I like the fact that periodically the chef at the buffet would put out different dishes.   A lot of the items that we were excited about  weren't available (suckling pig, beef ribs, lamb chops, pork ribs). We came on a Saturday night when these items should have been available.  The live entertainment was very brief - blink and you'd miss it."}
{"text":"The services and the food were all great! A place that really deserves a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am Brazilian, so with no arrogance, I can state that I know meat... :)  And I should add that  this is the place I go when I am homesick, missing a real \"churrascaria\" (Portuguese for Steakhouse)...   Undoubtedly this is the best place you can find if you're looking for a real barbecue (mind you - the Brazilian way!!) in Toronto!  It's worth every penny due to the variety, quality and quantity.  Enjoy or \"Bom Proveito\"!"}
{"text":"The services was fabulous and the ambiance was great.  The food was flavourful and exhilarating - the brased lamb was my favourite."}
{"text":"WOW, this place is amazing, the food is amazing the entertainment is great. It states it not good for kids, I disagree we took our youth soccer club here (8/9 year olds) and they loved it. I would recommend this place to any and everyone"}
{"text":"We went here for my brothers birthday.  I think there policy is a little silly. They only take reservations for groups of 6 or more. Since we were only 3 we had to wait. When we got there she told us 1.5 hours but it ended up being just shy of an hour. I dont get why they dont take reservations for all party sizes.  Decor wise, its a little weak. Nothing bad but nothing appealing either.   Food was amazing. I didnt fill up at the salad bar but the things I did take from there were all good (avocado salad, couscous, cheese bread)  All the meats they brought were phenomenal, my favs were the flank steak, the bacon wrapped filet and of course the grilled pineapple. My least favs were the garlic rubbed steak -because it was incredibly salty... like beyond, and the shrimp. The shell is on so its hard to eat and when you finally do get to eat it its also very salty.   For $45 bucks a person I would say the quality is definitely there, I dont know if you actually end up eatting as much as you think because they bring out the food so quickly and you keep saying yes and end up filling yourself up a lot quicker and on a lot less."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious. I knew it was going to be expensive, but the qualities of food and service were totally worth it!   they offered a wide selection of meats. the one with parmesean was my favourite, but also the bacon wrapped one and the one with chimicurri. actually, they were all really good. they also had some sausages and chicken. the food tasted amazing. the beef was really soft and tender. some were a little bit too salty, but i didnt mind. the crew came around every now and then. the sweet pineapple was delicious and a good way to cleanse the palette after so much meat. the cheesy bread was great. everything just tasted really great. lots of options in the salad bar, but i tried not to fill myself much on that.  my only recommendation is to take as much meat as you can eat at that time, you dont want to take all the meat that comes and leave them on the plate to eat after a few minutes because the meat then doesnt taste as good as when thy bring it to you all fresh.   tl; dr: amazing food, excellent service. totally recommend it and will certainly come again. maybe for summerlicious."}
{"text":"I was there on Fri for my friend's birthday party. I am very picky about meat, and everything I tried was top quality and cooked to perfection. The service was great and the waiters were very friendly. I have been to a couple of Rodizios restaurants before, one in Texas and another in North Carolina. CopaCabana Toronto is as good as others, may be a bit pricier. But hey, this is Canada :-) I wasn't really impressed with a salad bar and felt sorry for one of the girls in our party who was a vegetarian. Music was great and overall ambiance is very nice. The place is expensive but worth trying, at least once."}
{"text":"Copacabana has become a family fave. We love the Brazilian steakhouses, and think this one is the best of them all. It's rare that we feel comfortable taking our two boys to an upscale restaurant, but with lively music, a variety of foods that appeal to them and amazing staff, this is one of those places we truly can enjoy as a family.  The food is just incredible. Service is impeccable, from the quick and constant meat options to the sides and fresh dishes at the buffet.  The band and dancers keep it all so entertaining. Can't say enough about Copacabana!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for the atmosphere and the food.   Favourites: -skirt steak -prime rib with cheese -pineapple -cheese bread   One thing I dislike is how long it takes for the servers to come to your table. Everytime they come, you only get ONE THIN slice of meat...and then you got to wait till another server comes to give you another thinly sliced of meat.  The process of eating here can be veryy slow , and you may get impatient while waiting for more steak to come."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and was quite happy the first time but not in the slightest bit impressed on the last two trips to the point where I'm now writing it off as a place not to go. To summarize why:  - They are unwelcoming and with the rare exception, staff seem burdened when you make a request for a certain meat (which your card will tell you you are free to do). - The service was appalling as we sat waiting upwards of 10 minutes between slivers of meat while we watched food circle the two large tables beside ours but never come our way. With a two hour time-limit far too much of that was spent waiting and we left hungry...ironic given the \"all you can eat\" set up. - I am a HUGE fan of meats of all sorts but have never tasted such over-salted food!! Everything was doused in it and you could see the large sea salt granules. Totally unnecessary and ruins perfectly good meat.  - As a final note, I was violently ill as were two of the friends I went with after my most recent trip there despite not having eaten much for all the waiting we did.   Brazilian restaurants are great in general, but if you're looking for a good quality meal in a nice and welcoming atmosphere then I would recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Copacabana was a good experience. We went during the winterlicious time and it was very crowded. Reservations are very hard to get, however service is very good. The servers come very often to serve various cuts of steaks, salmon, and etc. The appetizer bar also had a good selection of food as well. Cons: It was far too crowded and a small restaurant. Even with our reservation, it took a while to be seated."}
{"text":"Great concept.  Attentive wait staff bringing tasty preparations of various meats...fresh from the grill.  Just a sliver of each is all that is needed because they keep it coming!  Salad bar with veggies/salads rounds out the meal.  Wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The best thing that they serve you is the grilled pineapple. Everything else was mediocre and ridiculously salty (we went through way too much water in one sitting). Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both left absolutely disappointed and with our stomachs trying to recover.  Definitely will never return here. Such a waste of $115."}
{"text":"This is a cool Brazilian Steak House!   Great for parties... We had our work's \"Happy Holiday\" party there, and I loved the atmosphere...  Lot of salads (about 50?), different beans dishes in buffet style, and are very tasty.  Beautiful waitresses bring you the prepared meat of your choice. Overall, the service is average, not bad though."}
{"text":"Never trust the lunch time promo.  I work in the Yonge and Eg neghbourhood and one day a group of us passed the \"$11.95 lunch\" banner draped over the Copacabana sign.  Knowing that most Brazilian steakhouse dinners go at $50 a head, I thought this was a steal.    I am not usually critical of ambiance but sometimes a venue just screams identity crisis.  The look was industrial meets art deco meets post modern and dirty tables.  There were some weird rounded corners and they had a mess hall table setup.  I have to say I was a little disappointed by the offering. Nothing special in the apps bar (rice, bean salads, cold pastas) and we were given a choice of just one piece of meat to complement the apps.  I know I should not have been expecting much, but I did expect more than a single sliver of salmon.  This place must be better at dinner time, but given the lunch experience I had, I'm not tempted to revisit any time soon."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday, and I had to wait for 3 hours. I just ended up going to the keg down the street. It's not a good place if you go as a couple. They make sit at the bar, and you don't even face your date. Would not recommend at all"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner yesterday. There is life entertainment, like Brazilian girls shaking their bootys. Oh the food was great and felt like for two hours we were on vacation. There is all you can eat salad/bread buffet. The meats were tasty and you can call for shrimp on order. Remember you have two hour to enjoy your food and drinks. Will go there agian."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my fifth visit to Copacabana.  So now I feel I can write a fair review about the place.  The good.  Great atmosphere and decor.  It's like having dinner at an all inclusive resort.  Very friendly & attractive employees. (can't help but noticing it, trust me) The food.  Great variety of meats and excellent salad bar. Great live music.  The bad? Or as I'll call it, what should be improved upon.  Cocktails a bit pricey for that part of town.  Beer prices for bottles at pint prices.  One thing about eating out at one place is that if you go enough times you start to notice trends.  Things like, how consistent are the staff in terms of helpfulness and friendliness, the quality of the food, levels of service ,etc.  What became clear to me at Copacabana is that they have a plan for every table that gets filled.  Pretty much once you are seated and have your first drinks, the BBQ comes to your table at a fast rate.  \"Morrocan chicken sir?  Garlic steak sir?\"  It seems that they want to inundate you with the meats right off the bat, fill you up, get you out and turn over the table to the next group.    When we got there the place was maybe 25% full and slowly climbing so for the most part all tables were getting served at the same time.  You'd see anywhere from 4-6 guys at a time moving around and serving. Then after a while, they'd all disappear for about 10-15 minutes.  And when they come out they whizz by your table and pretty much forget you were there.  Now I can imagine they're hitting up new customers like they did with us, but after five visits, I can say this is somewhat deliberate.  I'd say their goal is to turn a table around in 90mins to two hours max, unless you're ordering a lot of drinks.  I can understand they're a business and are trying to maximize their profits but after five visits, I can honestly say I feel like I'm being pushed out the door.  I like to take my time and relax when I'm having a meal.  If I want to save time and shove food into my mouth I'll go grab a burger.  When I sit down at a nice restaurant to eat I'm there to socialize more than I am to dine.  I feel rushed at this place.  Even when we turn over the card to the \"blue\" side to hold them off, they just ignore it, place the skewer on your table and ask \"who wants some?\"  That there tells me they want to turn the table over quickly.  The value for the money is there.  The meats are a little over seasoned at times, but you don;t have to take everything they bring.    If anyone from the restaurant reads the reviews here, my advice is simple.  1.) Have the carvers hold off if they see the blue sign. Don't try to stuff your guests to move them out quicker.  Allow your guests more down time between servings. 2.) Ease back on the salt. Most cuts of meat do not need it at all. 3.)Lower the drink prices.  Chances are more people will sit down longer and order more drinks.  In conclusion, by no means is this place a lost cause, but there is room for improvement. The value for the meal is very good as there is a lot of variety and the salad bar has a lot of fresh items to choose from.  Most steak houses will run you at minimum $50/person with one drink so this place is on par or better due to the variety.  This place can be a lot of fun, especially when the dancers show up."}
{"text":"This was an experience like none other. The ambience along with the food sets it a part from many other buffet style restaurants. There is a buffet of side dishes at the back of the restaurant and waitstaff come around with large skewered of uniquely flavoured meats (chicken,lamb,roast beef) and they are all very tender (most served medium rare).  The restaurant is kind of small but it allows for a lot to take place. Their was a two-person band performing tonight and then a unique dance show followed, both were incredible. You can expect to pay about $50 per person but that includes all you can eat everything. There literally is no limit to the quantity of meat and sides you can get. This restaurant is definitely one that I will not soon forget.  It was loud (the performances) so don't expect to hear your company as well as you usually would. The seating we had was by the door and it was cold and crafty all evening, so if you can, try to get a table in the middle of the restaurant or to the sides."}
{"text":"4.5 out of 5, minus 0.5 for washroom and some buffet foods  SKIRT STEAK RUB- amazing PRIME RIB WITH CHEDDER CHEESE- good FILET MIGNON WRAPPED IN BACON- good PARMESAN FILET MIGNON- really salty GARLIC STEAK SIRLOIN- freaking amazing RIB-EYE STEAK- good CHIMICHURRI STEAK- amazing PARMESAN CHICKEN- amazing  PICANHA BRAZIL- good TOP SIRLOIN- amazing FLANK STEAK- good MOROCCAN CHICKEN- the holy grail PORK SAUSAGE- ok ROASTED PINEAPPLE- holy grail #2  cheese bread/puff- amazing  now onto the buffet -all the salads were really good, i really enjoyed the caprese salad! -macaroni and pasta salad was good -rice and mash potatoes were ok -mussels were good, but were tiny -lasagna was a big big no no, the cheese and beef mixture tasted like paper mache -macaroni and cheese was ok, but needed salt -my favourite thing from the buffet stand was the sautéed mushrooms and pasta salad  service - very attentive and observant on what needed to be refilled, given a clean plate etc. -the carvers were nice -they always ask if you have any requests and bring it out within minutes -given a complimentary dessert for celebrating our anniversary, so that was nice!  atmosphere -washroom sucked, it was tiny -live music was AMAZING -manager comes checks on you  **side note, they did charge $1 for each time they refilled your water, because it was filtered \"veto\" water, so ask for tap water.   but overall, the main star of the show was the grilled pineapple (i ended up with 6 slices) and the skirt steak rub and Moroccan chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is an interesting conundrum. The locale and atmosphere is great. Vibrant, live band and mostly friendly staff. The service and concept is...  Unique. Staff members come around and serve you slices of meat straight off of roasting skewers. However the selection is unbalanced. We've had some items come much more often then others. And some menu items that were supposed to not be served that day were. There are cards that you are given to indicate if you still want to be served or not - which is largely ignored by staff anyways. There is a buffet as well, however the items there were not labeled, leaving us guessing, and some of the dishes has pieces of dirt still on them. However the food was pretty good (not super amazing, but pure, delicious meat!) , a delicious treat for sure. But for the price, I'm a bit disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"Went last night for my friends birthday, what an amazing experience !   The meats were all tender and juicy, the service was top notch, the atmosphere was friendly and the whole experience was just amazing.   I loved the parmesan steak, Moroccan spicy chicken was excellent, the pineapple was out of this world and ask for the bananas for dessert. You won't regret it .  It was my first time, I tried everything... I would suggest wearing pants with a little breathing room... You'll thank me later .   Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Its better to go as a group with ATLEAST 3 people because I went with just my girlfriend, and we were stuck in the corner that seats 2 people.  Most of the time, the carvers served the other tables around us, and then walked away without looking at us.  Aside from that, steaks are amazing. My favourites are the parmesan filet mignon, top sirloin, garlic sirloin and picanha Brazil special. I LOVE the grilled pineapple! Goes great with the spinach and berry salad. :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for our anniversary and were not disappointed. This was because the staff were very helpful in accommodating her garlic allergy as well as the fact that she doesn't eat pork. They even prepared some steam vegetables without garlic especially for her. It was nice to see a restaurant take her allergy seriously which doesn't always happen.   The servers were also conscious of her dietary restrictions and remembered not to offer her anything with pork or garlic throughout the night.   The wine selection was impressive and the ambiance was perfect for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Came here recently with a party of 4. Everything was delicious an we were very impressed with the service. The staff really went out of their way to make sure we had everything we wanted. The food was all very good, we were specifically impressed with the quality of the meat. The chimichurri steak as well as the cornbread muffins are a must try! Overall, very impressed."}
{"text":"Went to this spot yesterday and it definitely lived up to the hype. The food was AMAZING! How this place works is, you plate your own sides at the buffet, then the waiters come around each table with various meats on skewers that you can opt to try or not. Unfortunately I did not get to see the belly dancers, but the food and customer service made up for that."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brazilian steakhouse in Toronto.  They have a large selection of meat, all of which are tender and flavourful.  The salad bar has enough to get you through as well, although it woudln't hurt to have a few more items on the menu.  Nothing bad to say about the deco and environment; the restaurant is bustling most of the times with dancing and music."}
{"text":"As someone who happily described himself as a meat loving carnivore in the past, I find myself surprised that I didn't give Copacabana an automatic 5-stars. But, I suppose that with age, came sensibility and the desire to make room for different food.   I came here for a friend's birthday dinner with a group of 20+. Before the meat madness commenced, we hit the buffet station at the back of the restaurant. It offered a small selection of breads and salads, and some rice and pasta as well. We all took our seats again, and our hostess explained how service worked.   The long and short of it: servers come by your table carrying a large kebab with meat on it (Kind of like what you'd you see at a shawarma shop) and if you want a piece, they'll slice one off for you to grab.   There are also coasters on the table that you can use to signal to the servers that you want more, or to let them know that you're taking a break/done for the night. (To be honest, I think they paid more attention to our faces than the coasters to judge whether we wanted more or not.)  The portion sizes are bite size (maybe two or three-bite size, depending), but if you don't pace yourself, you'll hit \"the wall\" sooner rather than later. Then you start getting the meat sweats, etc. etc. Not sexy.  You might also run into a situation where all the meat starts to taste the same after awhile. (One of my fellow diners would munch on some kale from the salad bar in between each meat in order to cleanse her palate. A good idea for next time!)  Having said all that, the Picanha Brazil was my favourite of all the meats. They called it the house specialty, and rightfully so. Beautifully seasoned, medium-rare to medium (as with all the steaks) and left me wanting more. Make sure to get to this one early on!   The chicken selections were somewhat disappointing, but everything else was excellent. The skirt steak rub was a bit on the unexpected side, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. The grilled pineapple was sweet and refreshing. A nice way to end the meal. As a bonus, live music and dancers came on closer to the end of our meal. They even had someone showing off some capoeira! Great entertainment.   The bill was a tad on the pricey side, but when I remember that tip was included and that we were treated to a show on top of dinner, it makes me feel better about life.   Copacabana is not a place I'd go to on a frequent basis, but for what it is, it is excellent! Look forward to going again!  ...in like six months or something."}
{"text":"For a meat-lover like me, this place is paradise! Love the atmosphere and definitely going back for more!!"}
{"text":"I have been to all the locations of copa and am a big fan. I have been going for years and now going to the eglinton location for my 3rd time iv fibally decided to write a review.  I find that the quakity n service at the eglinton location isnt that great. Everytime i go there i dont enjoy it as much. Either the spreas isnt great or the meats.  I would definitely suggest the adelaide location over this. Now that would be a 5 star"}
{"text":"This review is for the Adelaide location. Have been here a few times but never have had experience like this before. Me and my boyfriend came here for dinner a couple weeks ago and food was very good ,service was okay kind of slow it was very hot and stuffy not to mention took forever to get a table but towards the end of the night just as we were leaving heard this man screaming at this poor girl who was crying she looked like she worked there saying i'm the owner blah blah you should obey me and going on and on he looked like your typical douche bag know it all rich guy. I asked one of the servers after if that was a joke and if he was really the owner and she replied yes with a look of embarrassment on her face. Next time the owner wants to scream at his staff he should try to do it during closing hours so the guests don't hear him, just a thought. Overall i would go back but probably not to this location."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday.  Great selection of meat.  All the meat was well cooked and served hot.  Chicken was juicy and had great flavor (particularly Parmesan Drumsticks)  Garlic Marinated Steak and Herb Marinated Pork Loin were 2 of my favorites.  They don't like taking reservations for small party's so if you get a group (5+) you'll have an easier time.  There were only 4 of us and we had a few cocktails at the bar waiting for a table - if time is on your side it is a good way to go.  They like to hold them for larger parties.  The evening dancing entertainment is definitely a good show and worth seeing.  Service was decent (nothing spectacular) and the hostesses were pleasant, but not overly welcoming.  Considering the prices, frankly I was expecting a little higher level,   Good experience overall and i certainly left satisfied with the meal"}
{"text":"I was skeptical as I am of any all you can eat places, but luckily, they carve you off pieces of meats (as opposed to giving you an entire steak, or lamb rack).  The meat is cooked well (don't know why the carver kept refusing to give me the rarer pieces). Some of the steaks ended up being dry.  The skirt steak was awesomely seasoned, and the salad bar is AWESOME.  and as it has been mentioned before, the pineapple is amazing.   considering it is an all you can eat place, the food quality is pretty high, but you're going to pay for it (which is fair)."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times in the past. This time however, I feel the food tasted much better, maybe because we went as soon as they opened up for lunch on a Sunday so everything was fresh. Once you arrive they tell you that you have up to two hours to finish your meal. The salad bar was clean and organized. The guys who served the meat were very nice. However, the lady who walked us to our table and the waitress both were below our expectations. The host or whatever you would call her was rude and the waitress seemed like she was avoiding any requests and it would take her a long time to respond or to bring anything to the table. The restaurant wasn't that busy at the time. If it wasn't for them, I would have given this place 4 stars minimum. I wish the restaurant could reorganize the tables and the stage in a way that everyone could enjoy seeing the live band."}
{"text":"Amazing Brazilian steak house. The meat is so delicious. The servers are very friendly and polite. They always ask you if there is anything in particular you want next, etc. Everything has so much flavour! Just great. Definitely pricey but worth every penny. Not only you get amazing salads and sides, but the meat is worth it alone.  The chicken is so yummy too! Grilled pineapple is outstanding."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the last 12 mos. Great experience everytime! Amazing food and lots of it, if you like meat. Salad and hot food bar also has a great variety. Quick tip : save some room for the pineapple."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good company. Food experience and staff were excellent. Not cheap but well worth the value if you are a meat eater."}
{"text":"Meat lover's paradise.. best steak I've had in toronto."}
{"text":"If you have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse in another country, you might think this place is okay and offers value, but if you have seen what the real thing is, this place comes very short as a cheap imitation.  The quality cuts of meat are either non-existent or come around too seldom.  There are lots of rounds of cheap cuts of meat, sausage, chicken, etc.  I am not surprised though as that is the general restaurant motto in Toronto: cut corners, use cheaper stuff, and hope that your customers don't notice."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend. It was summerlicious time in Toronto so the place was packed. I first recommend that you reserve a table. It can get quite busy so call ahead to reserve. So, the way this works is that you have a 2 hour time limit. At your table you have a steak knife and a fork. On the left side you have a pair of tongs. So where are the plates? Well, there is a salad and pasta buffet at the end of the restaurant. You get your plates from there. All of this may have seemed logical but the host who seated us mumbled the instructions. So, when you have your plate, these guys come around with meat on skewers. They use a knife to cut a sliver of meat. This is where your tongs come in... you use your tongs to grab the meat as the guy is slicing off a morsel. Obviously the meat came off in pieces and I had to keep grabbing the pieces as they were falling off. One piece was accidentally knocked into my friend's cup by the guy. Another server got upset at me cause I was not holding the meat properly as he was slicing off a piece. Actually, I could not tell if he was upset or just telling me how to grab the meat cause again the guy mumbled. What is it with this place? They all mumble. The meats were cooked nicely, but man they were all salty! All I tasted was salt. Note: if you have a high blood pressure problem avoid this place. If Brazilian cuisine is this salty I am surprised that they don't have a high blood pressure epidemic in that country! The best meat was the spicy chicken cause it was not as salty as the other meats. The pineapple was delicious. I recommend that one for sure. The meat came around frequently so you were not waiting too long in between your meats. As contrary to what I read before, they don't charge you a $1 for water. The buffet was average. The service was decent. Since it was summerlicious, it was $35 per person. I don't think I ate $35 worth of meat (i got full really quick), but if you can eat a lot of meat, then go for it."}
{"text":"Pretty good food offer a nice variety of meats but the pineapple must be my favorite. However didn't get to try all the food because not every type came to our table. All and all a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, which isn't anywhere near as often as I wish I could.  The cuts here are some of the most flavourful and juicy I've ever experienced. It can be overwhelming at first, and it's hard to remember exactly what you're eating if you don't pace yourself but it's all good.. because it's ALL good.  Save your stomach and overdose on succulent protein goodness!  On top of that, there is entertainment and a buffet that has some great choices of sides and salads that are, surprisingly, almost equally delicious.  I've heard some complain about the saltiness of the meat but I didnt think it was overdone.  Good service and great food!"}
{"text":"I'm in love! All you can eat, a show, gorgeous staff. Affordable, I want all my birthdays here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I love meet and you can get as much as you want.....Dance was OK, but if you are not sitting in the center you cannot see much of it.  Servers were friendly and helped me with anything I asked. I asked them to bring me two of my favorite steaks at the end...They did it quickly and I made sure that I get more than I wanted. I wish it was a bit cheaper so I would go there more often."}
{"text":"HOLY COW!!!   Wow - I am still salivating at the memory of my meal here. Now let me start this by saying that I don't particularly enjoy beef - seriously, I just don't. But my friends really wanted me to come here with them because they were sure this would be the place to finally convert me to the pleasures of eating red meat - particularly steak. So I agreed in joining them here for dinner.   The hostess showed us to our table and proceeded to explain to us how things work. Basically, there is a \"salad\" buffet at the back of the restaurant that has a variety of things like: mashed potatoes, sauteed veggies, fried cassava root, fresh salads, olives, bread, soup, etc,etc,etc.....  After you have filled your plate with whatever catches your eye, you proceed to your seat and wait for the very hunky gauchos to bring you unlimited amounts of delicious meat. And you get to check them out while they do this - just make sure your date doesn't catch you (mine did) as this can make things a bit uncomfortable....   Anyway, I tried a large variety of meats including seasoned flank steak, pork loin, Parmesan chicken thighs, fillet Mignon, bacon wrapped fillet Mignon, peppery BBQ ribs, salmon, lamb, steak with cheese, suckling pig, homemade sausages, etc.... so much meat I can't even remember it all. There is a little menu card on the table, and if you see something on there that you'd like to try but haven't, just ask the next gaucho that comes around and they will bring it to you. Oh - and make sure to have the grilled pineapple, not only is it sweet and delicious, but it will aide you in digesting all those massive amounts of meat.   Service here was great - all the servers were super friendly and accommodating, and our drinks were refilled continuously. We came on a Friday night, and they have live entertainment. A Brazilian band plus Samba dancers and Capoeira performers. They only have these on weekends, so I guess that's the best time to check this place out.   Oh and if you get caught checking out your cute gaucho, fret not. Your date can check out the skimpy dressed Samba dancers and make things even :)   Definitely a place worth checking out at least once, but I enjoyed it so much that we are returning in a couple of weeks. I guess I was converted into a full fledged carnivore after all.   USEFUL INFO: They will only take reservations for 6 or more people."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night for a friend's birthday dinner. There were three of us at our table. This was my 4th visit to this establishment in 2 years.  SEATING/ATMOSPHERE I called an hour before our scheduled eating time for a reservation and my party was easily accommodated.  FOOD & DRINKS For about five minutes we were ignored. Eventually our server made her way to our table. We ordered the caipirinha, which took a very long while to arrive, but was divine. We also ordered a bottle of Prosecco which was $34 and was a hit at our table.  Food. Well its a brazilian steakhouse and I trust that you know what that is. My brief review of the meats is....OK. I've been to a Brazilian Steakhouse in Chicago (Brazzaz) and it was the bomb! At Copacabana all of their meats seem to have been soaked in salt for days. After a few of the types of meats they bring to your table, they honestly all start to taste the same.  Salad bar was mediocre. Be sure however to request the complementary cornbread, cheese puffs and fried bananas....yummy!!  SERVICE Our server was somewhat absent - especially when she was needed. The manager needs to smile more. He seems to be the only one that deals with the settlement of the accounts. Are the servers not capable or trusted to process payments - very odd.  VERDICT .... PASS. Will likely return for another salty meat comatose in a few months for another celebration. I will not be rushing back though...thats for sure . $220 for 3 people including alcohol and tip. ....3/5 because of too much salt.  TIPS. a. For some Carnival-style entertainment, go on Wednesday through Sunday. No entertainment on Monday and Tuesday. b. Ask for a table in the back section of the restaurant close to the salad bar. This section of the restaurant has perhaps a dozen tables and is more quieter and intimate than the \"main section\"."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high. Or maybe they were as high as they should have been. I just think that when a place sells itself as a dining \"experience,\" it should be one. And a true dining experience is found (or lost) in the details.  I've been second-guessing my first impression of Copacabana since my maiden voyage to the Mecca of Meat two weeks ago. I was excited about gauchos carrying swords stacked with meat, carving it to my little heart's content.  I was intrigued by the meat offerings I read about online. And I liked the idea of an appetizing side-dish bar to start it all off.  Restaurant:  A fellow Yelper has done a wonderful job describing the concept, so I'll summarize. It's an all-you-can eat BBQ and steakhouse with table service and a wide selection of meats.   We arrived (two of us) at 8:30 on a Tuesday. The band was still playing, the meat was still flying and the cozy-looking front patio was still full. We opted for indoor seating and wound up near the back of an expansive seating area with an intimate feel for its size.  We asked for a table next to the one we were shown; it hadn't been cleaned but was a little more tucked away (we were on a first date and looking for a cozy spot). Our hostess noted the new table's condition and had our server provide a wipedown. It turns out that watching a server make a table look clean is a lot like watching sausage be made - best you don't know how it's done. The top got a wipe; the underside then started to drip the remnants of a variety of animals and cocktails onto the floor below us. I asked the server to give the underside a wipe as well, but she appeared confused. Hand gestures helped and the underside was ultimately cleaned. This helped me to understand why the floor was so slippery - over the course of a night it must see the grease of a thousand meats. A mid-shift mopping would have done wonders here.  Side dishes:  I was a Copacabana virgin; my companion had been before and knew the routine. We started with a trip to the \"Harvest Table,\" a spread of side dishes that were sufficiently exotic to satisfy the adventurous (shrimp with baby corn?) but also had some standard fare for the mashed potatoes type (although I don't recall actually seeing mashed potatoes). There were pastas sitting out in the frying pans they had been cooked in; while this was a neat presentation, it seemed that they had sat there a while. I indulged nonetheless, aware that I often eat my own cooking an hour later. I failed to heed the advice of my companion (\"go easy on the sides and save room for meat!\") and wound up eating a somewhat-dry salmon in cream sauce out of guilt more than anything else.  All said the sides were decent but not exciting.  Meat!  Copacabana works on a red-card / green-card system - turn your card to green, I was told by the website, and the carvers would know to stop by with their meat offerings (flip it to red, and you'll be left alone). This sounded fun but the cards were kitschy, like something you'd see at Boston Pizza rather than a traditional churrascuria.  I also soon realized that the gauchos (carvers) would stop by with meat no matter which side of the card was showing (making it difficult to have an intimate conversation on a first date). I think the two issues were related - neither side of the card was clearly red or green, and instead read \"heat it up\" on one side and \"cool it down\" on the other (I may be paraphrasing). I suspect the carvers couldn't read the card until they showed up next to our table with a loaded skewer. On the plus side, we never had to wait long. The gauchos were friendly and skilled but seemed a bit rushed.  The meat was delicious. Two weeks after my visit I still recall many of the items I had. The house steak was memorable; the bacon-wrapped turkey and parmesan-crusted steak were great too. The Moroccan chicken was too spicy for my companion; I thought it was fabulous (a nice, slow burn). Still, I found significant variation from what's listed on the website. I was looking forward to a slow-roasted leg of lamb, and instead got lamb chops. I also don't recall tasting the parmesan-crusted pork loin that had inspired so much drooling before my visit. I ate a lot of meat that night, and found little to object to in its quality, especially considering the volumes they must do.  Overall:  We enjoyed a good meal, but the \"experience\" wasn't all it could have been. Here's what would take Copacabana to 4 or 5 stars:  - Cleaner tables and floors (tops & bottoms!) - A red/green card that is just that. Red on one side, green on the other. And carvers who heed the \"code of the card.\" - A website that sets the right expectation - no promising what you're not offering. - A nightly meat listing on the way in the door if offerings vary. - Better care taken at the side-dish bar, including fresher pastas."}
{"text":"I don't generally give low stars but this place deserves it. I hope the manager reads this.   It started off with a sour and generally unpleasant hostess. We had a reservation. Then, all but one server going around with meat were rude and indifferent to your requests. They may be over worked but most people go out to a restaurant for the experience and atmosphere.   But the main issue was that everything was extremely salty. I know they're trying to deter you from eating too much but they should think about repeat business with good food instead of really salty food that could totally increase your blood pressure and be harmful to your body.   Finally, $46 before tax and tip to feel like you are begging for food is not what you want when there are tons of great restaurants in Toronto.   Tip: Ask for a specific kind of meat that you want. Otherwise, you'll fill up on cheap, overly seasoned cuts."}

{"text":"This is my second time at a Brazilian grill place and despite the big name and popularity through word of mouth I leave less the impressed. The food was mediocre and you can tell that the frequency of quality meat is controlled ... with a bias. Let's just say I see more pine apple than fillet mignon. The service wasn't impressive. I have requested salmon twice and it did not come.   I don't see any incentive to recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"First off, the Brazilian steakhouse experience is a must-try at least once if you've never been. This restaurant is quite known, super busy and crowded - there's not much room and it's loud (they have live music on certain days) but the music is good. However, because they are so busy the service is slow but decent. As soon as we told them the meat was coming too slow, they tried to come accommodate which I appreciate. If you are craving meat, this is the perfect place if you're willing to spend more than the average meal for a fancy buffet. I would definitely come back and I recommend this to any meat lover out there.  All of the food is pretty good but these were some of my favourites: - Grilled pineapple  - Leg of lamb - Bacon wrapped filet mignon!!  - Picanha steak  - Kale salad  - Couscous"}
{"text":"I was excited to come to this Brazilian steakhouse after hearing fantastic reviews through word of mouth in comparison to other establishments. A group of friends and I came for Winterlicious for dinner. We made a reservation for 7:30, but we weren't seated until 7:50 pm (there is free parking in the rear after 7 pm). However, we were given our final calls and bills right at 9 pm (not even meeting the typical two hour seating time). The seating we had was right in the corner of the restaurant, which was acceptable but we found that the service became inconsistent (waiters would serve half of our table and leave because they didn't want to serve the other half). Getting the waitresses for things like water was a mission, but given the location and the number of staff that is acceptable. The food menu was good with the salad bar, but nothing outstanding. It would have been nice to have pictures and the meat menu so we could make special requests given the frequency of the service. The highlight of the night was the show, which was hyped but we couldn't see anything given the seating. Overall, the food was decent but the service and the poor time management brought down the rating from satisfactory to questionable."}
{"text":"I don't know how to write this review without making it prone to innuendos, but here goes. It was the most amazing all-you-can-eat experience I've ever had. It was divine. Minute after minute, servers came out and elegantly carved a sliver or two of meat on a stick. Everything was seasoned well, grilled well, so juicy, om nom nom. And all I had to do was sit there and wait for them to come around with different meat. Ohhhh I can't wait to go back. The show on the weekend evenings with scantily clad women was alright, but I couldn't see with the amount of iPads in my way. It's a great experience to shell out $40 for, but I don't think it's a \"repeat customer\" sort of place. It's a novelty and I don't know how sustainable it is."}
{"text":"First time here for a birthday party.  Went to the salad bar and didn't grab too much because i knew i wanted to eat as much of the meats as possible.  The mango and avocado was amazing. The servers came around with alot of the different cuts of meats. My fav was their signature sirloin steak, it was so juicy!!! THe best thing was the grilled pineapple. Everyone at the table wanted more.  Overall the experience was great, i loved the live band and dancing."}
{"text":"I've been to Brazilian Steak Houses before, including a different location of Copacabana, so I knew what to expect. Lots of meat, until you feel like you're pregnant. My idea of a great meal.  So man, was I disappointed when I didn't even get a chance to eat here.  I walked in on a Saturday evening. I didn't make reservations, so I wasn't expecting to get a table right away. That's fair. But I wasn't expecting the wait times that they told me, either: an hour and a half. And it's not like I was with a big group, either. Just two people.  To make matters worse, when I entered the restaurant, neither me, nor the person I was with were acknowledged by anyone. We had to get their attention. As if they had more important things to do than... their job.  And finally, when I heard about the wait time, and told them politely that I was leaving, they said in an almost patronizing tone \"OK\" (the tone almost said \"who needs you, anyway?\"). No invitation to come back, no apology, no sympathy.  They might want to train their staff in customer service 101."}
{"text":"Signs that you have overdosed on meat: *Dry mouth *Blurry vision *You know that you are imagining it, but you hear mooing noises in the distance *You undo the top button of your jeans to make room for your gut *You feel like you never ever want to eat meat again (well until late the next day at least)  Ugh. That is how I feel right about now.  I arrived hungry, excited for my glorious Brazilian meat feast. I headed right for the salad bar.... just to check it out.  However, for 40$ a head, I wasn't going to fill up on cold pastas, greens, and baby shrimp.  At first I was impatient, the meat couldn't come fast enough. The waitstaff made their rounds skillfully carving small tender portions of meat.  I think they found it funny to see how much I could eat because they started coming by very frequently.  And ladies, the servers are cute dudes with nice biceps. For the gents, they have dancing girls that make an appearance in some sexy outfits.  Anyways, back to the meat. I tried everything.  Juicy, tender, tasty...but a bit salty.  After round 12 everything starts to taste the same.  And anything wrapped in bacon loses it's appeal.  Taking a break from meat, the fried bananas, cornbread, and grilled pineapple rounded out the meal with some sweetness.  I had a lot of fun here!"}
{"text":"This a great steakhouse, although nothing compared to the Brazilian ones. The salad bar was very poor if you are used to a Brazilian rodizio style. The shows only happen quickly and not very frequently. Sometimes the waiters forget about coming to your side but the beef was good and the drinks fine. It would be better tho with some seafood selection on the salad bar."}
{"text":"The Open Table ~ Our reservation was a complete failure...even though it was confirmed in the App...for there & they didn't have our reservation The Door Greeter was really nice & she accommodated us in about 15 mins, while we sat at the bar & waited while enjoying one of the best piña coladas Cheers   Food ~ excellent options & very well flavoured taste!! The mashed sweet potato, all of the steaks & the salad ...MWAAA!!! The fried banana  an added plus  Entertainment ~ WOW  felt like I was enjoying it on a tropical  vacation in a resort  Parking ~ Located in the Loblaws underground parking garage located almost directly across from the restaurant. Paid a flat rate of $4 (think the rate is available from 4pm-8am).   Very accessible ~ If you decide to take public transportation, it's a few blocks away from Eglinton subway.   Overall experience ~ Will definitely return & recommend others go. All of the staff including the door greeters, waiters & waitresses, bartenders, management were very pleasant, accommodating & full of exceptional customer service skills!!! Enjoyed our Winterlicious"}
{"text":"My favourite meat restaurant in all Toronto. Everything here is just delicious , all you can eat brazilian style meat for your pleasure. Dont miss it and if you want have fun go the week end but make a reservation first"}
{"text":"i have to say the \"meat\" was good and we certainly got enough of it.  However, the salad bar and appetizer buffet was tacky and made feel like I was at the dirty buffet at the excalibur in vegas.  Over all the experience was cool, but not worth the price of 40$ a head."}
{"text":"I see mixed reviews about this place.  I went there today.  Sunday. 4:30PM.  It wasn't full yet, but started to get pretty full by 5:30PM.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  Seated and ordered a blue tequila based drink.  Very good.  $10, but still very good.  Went to the buffet.  Didn't think there was that much at the buffet, but then again, wasn't prepared for all the meats.  Sat down and the meat started to arrive one at a time.  I suppose when the place is full the service time may be slow, but for me it was so busy it was hard to keep up with it.  Lots of different varieties of meats.  And it was nice to be able to get just a small slice.  A 'dry rub' steak isn't a steak I'd normally order, but to be able to try one and find I liked it was nice to discover about myself.   Same with 'roasted pineapple.' I would NEVER order roasted pineapple, but called the guy back a few times.  This was amazing.  Also nice to learn that about myself.  Now I'm pretty easily jaded and not often wowed when I go out to a place.  Usually I find the food is 'ok' as is the service.  But at the Copa, ALL the food was great, including the buffet.  The meats were positively amazing.  I didn't have a single thing that didn't impress me.  And the service - right from the moment I walked in the door everyone who passed my table, from hostess to waitress to (I don't know what they are called) the guys with the big sticks of meat were very attentive, asked how everything was, asked if there was anything else I needed.  Bill was $100 even for two of us.  Left a $20 tip for the service.  So for me this place had the rarest of combinations.  Excellent food and excellent service.  My one disappointment is that they didn't have the live entertainment on a Sunday, but that just gives me a reason to go back.  I left feeling stuffed.  I should have stopped earlier.  But I just couldn't."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for Winterlicious and had a great time. The meat was a bit on the saltier side but with some salad it didn't feel too bad. The entertainment was ok (some dancers and live band playing) but it did get old pretty quickly. I'm not sure if it's because we were there on a Friday night but the restaurant was extremely noisy and my friends and I had to yell at each other to be heard so this is not the place if you're looking to have a quiet meal. I would recommend trying out this place once just for the experience.  For the menu, I highly recommend the top sirloin and the grilled pineapple!   Tips for drivers: You do get free parking after 7PM. The parking lot is behind the building, off of Redpath Ave. - make sure you drive all the way in. All you have to do is park and leave your car information with the waitress at the front."}
{"text":"Horrible experience a few years back when I took my girl for a birthday dinner. The manager admitted that they lied on the phone during the booking process when I was told that her meal would be free. The servers a few years back were wretched and the food at the salad bar was soggy. The only saving grace from that visit was the quality of the meat. That part was fantastic! I made an effort to never go back to this location. Last week my girl (now my fiancee) was dying for some Brazilian steakhouse so we gave the Vaughan location a shot... WAY BETTER! It was such a good experience that I am considering heading back to this location in the next few weeks to meet up with a few business buddies of mine."}
{"text":"Dinner  Ambience:3.5/5  Food:4/5 Service: 4/5 Value: 4/5 Repeat: yes  Overall: my dinner here was more enjoyable than my experience at Barberians steakhouse (which was good)."}
{"text":"i would give this a 3.5/5.  I came here during Winterlicious and it was only a $10 discount per person but still. If you check in with your Yelp app, you can get 10% off...not sure if you can stack it on top of the Winterlicious price, I didn't bother asking.  My reservation was for a Sunday night and there was live music which I actually really liked. But that was because our table was at the back near the kitchen so it wasn't loud for us. The atmosphere is definitely more homey/family-friendly than the downtown location. It felt like we were at a pub with the live music.   The food was good, however, for the first 30 minutes, literally no one came around to our table with the meat. We had to flag down one of the gauchos and even then he said that he had to go his section and couldn't help us at that moment. They definitely wanted us to stock up on our carbs and on the buffet. Our waitress was great, she continually asked us if we had any requests. Every time she asked, I told her I wanted the bacon-wrapped filet mignon, salmon, and the Moroccan chicken. She was very attentive and came back quite frequently to ask if we had received any of the requests, and we had not! I literally did not get my filet mignon or Moroccan chicken until I was completely full and pretty much right before we were about to pay. I only got the salmon, filet mignon, and Moroccan chicken once during our meal. I like the downtown location's Moroccan chicken and salmon seasoning more than this location. Some of the steaks were over-cooked.  It's unfortunate that the service only improved/the meat started coming around near the end of our meal when we were already full. Overall, I prefer the downtown location over this one and I would only come back here for the Winterlicious/Summerlicious price."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the very best Brazilian steakhouses in Ontario. Very Well served meats of many variety, love coming here and the waiters/waitresses are just wonderful people"}
{"text":"Stacks on stacks of meat, and some super yummy pineapple!   I think at one point, I was playing catch up with all the cuts of meat I had waiting for me on my plate. All of us couldn't help being a little extra gluttonous.   And who can say no to their pineapple?  The second time they came around with the pineapple, to my group of 6, and we were told there were only 3 pieces left at the moment... Every man for himself! Needless to say, I wanted them all..  Service was meh. We initially had reservations made for 9, and didn't actually get seated until almost 9:30.  It wasn't even a case where they were full and couldn't accommodate - there were multiple empty tables (that seated 6). Yet, we were told to wait, as the server continued to seat others who came after us with later reservations of 9:30.  It wasn't until we had to press them for our reservation a 3rd time, where we finally got seated - in the corner of the restaurant beside the bar. Not impressed. Not to mention there were still empty tables in the main dining.   Quality-wise for the food was much better, in comparison to their Adelaide location. Salad bar/antipasto at this location was much smaller and bleak, but the mussels are worth mentioning.   There is also free parking available! Located behind the building, for 150 Eglinton. Just need to validate with the hostess."}
{"text":"The setup is similar to every other Rodizio barbecue. There is an all-you-can-eat bar with carbs and vegetables and the servers walk around with giant skewers of meat. My favourite were the kale salad, the mushrooms with the mashed potatoes and also the grilled pineapple. YUM! As for the meats, I thought the ribs could have been a little more juicy (it was pretty dry) but I did enjoy the top sirloin. The service was pretty slow and the waitress was no where to be seen for drinks and refills (-1). The ambiance was great, there is seating outside during the summer which is nice and I enjoyed the live music the most. :)"}
{"text":"Wide selection of amazing meats that were cooked perfectly ( medium/ medium rare) ,however ,if you want your meat cooked more or less you can ask them and they will cook to order . The salad bar is pretty good and the service was great. There was live entertainment when I went which included a live band , woman dancing in what I would best describe as Brazilian carnival dress , but my favourite was being able to see the Brazilian capoeira fight/dance. This is a definitely a place to check out and worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Food 3.75/5 (60% of final grade) The buffet table's spread wasn't that appealing, though they had a very interesting cheese bread loaf. What was really above average about the food was the they had these cheese ball breads (that you have to request for them to bring you), and high quality meats. The experience is also unique in that the employees will actually go around the restaurant with different freshly-grilled meats (steaks, chicken breasts, kebabs, all the good stuff) and cut it for you. You have a little metal tongs that you hold the meat with while they cut the meat for you. DO NOT PULL on the meat though, as I was told by the first person who cut the cut for me.   Ambiance 2/5 (10% of final grade) Could have been so much better if there wasn't this super loud music by the live band. Don't get me wrong, I love live music, it's just that it was too loud for me to even hear my friends on the other side of the table, while they were shouting. That isn't normal volume, I don't think. The lights were dim, and in general it seemed like an above-average place, but only bring a date here if you want to concentrate on the food and have zero conversations. Seriously, the music was way too loud.   Service 3.5/5 (10% of final grade) The employees were well-dressed and attentive despite being busy. Even though my group of 5 went during Summerlicious, we were asked how we liked the food and everything my the lady server. The meat cutters would usually be gentlemen. The only reason I didn't give a higher score was because were requested pineapple several times with different servers, but most of them failed their promise to come back with it. Luckily, one very good homie brought the goods, and that was awesome.   Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) The cost was expected with the quality of the food, the experience, and the service. Not much of a bargain, but standard. With the frequency at which the servers came around with the meat, you don't actually get THAT much. It's just the illusion you're getting a lot, because you eat slowly and get full faster.  Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade) To the hot cheese bread balls the lady waitress brought out for us. And the pineapple.   Final Grade = 67/100 = 3 Stars (But almost 4!)  TLDR: Go once to experience what it's like, but it's not a place I would be back to anytime soon. The meat is extraordinary, but the experience as a whole was only average."}
{"text":"I don't think it's really worth it for the price. Some of the meat was tasty but some of them was just bad and over cooked. If I'm pay upwards of $80 person (if you're drinking) then I expect a lot better quality.  The entertainment was meh.  The side dishes were okay at best.  We constantly had to wait for our protein.  We usually finish our meat once they place it on our plates.  Then we wait another 10 mins before another serving.  I grilled pineapple was very good, but not enough for me to say I want to go back again.  Once is enough."}
{"text":"I've been to a Brazilian Steak House before, but never Copacabana, which is pretty popular IMO. So I was pretty down when I heard that they were offering summerlicious (which is basically their AYCE dinner at a SLIGHTLY lower price...) the summerlicious price is $38+tax AND a mandatory 15% tip, so since we went on a Friday night, in the end we saved about $10.  The food was good, however I think they need to work more on coordinating their staff because the same 2-3 types of meat kept appearing at our table over and over, whereas other meats didn't and we had to send in requests. The pineapple was nice and sweet, but I wish there was more cinnamon on it! Since the other Brazilian Steak House I've been to had on-par quality meat, I would probably go there instead, since their service and ambiance is way better.  I asked the waitress near the end of the meal if I could see a copy of the menu so I can see what we didn't get to try yet, and she told me that its available online. However, not everyone has smart phones/data so I really think they should have had at least a few print-outs of the meat selection. Also, the waitress was rushing us out which I didn't really like. We had a 8:30 reservation, and at 9:30 she was handing us the bill without us asking. (even though the table next to us came earlier than us and got their bill way later). And after the staff saw we had paid our bills, they kept asking us if we had any *final* requests for the kitchen, even though we were still in the middle of our meals! Then at 10:30, the waitress came by and told us we are \"lucky\" that there was a last minute reservation cancellation, so we can stay a bit longer. However, I looked around and a bunch of tables were empty and there was no line at the door. She's just been waiting for us to leave for an hour."}
{"text":"I have been to Copacabana many times and always had an good experience. I have gone during my birthday and my bill was paid for and was given a small cake, which I really liked. I recommend going here to celebrate birthdays, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. There is always a line up. It is pricey but well worth it. I have been there multiple times. I went there other night(weeknight) there was a  musician but the music was way too loud. I find that the servers themselves arent very good but the carvers one word...yummy."}
{"text":"I love Copacabana and everyone I know that has been there is also in love with this place. It is an all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse. The cooks bring different meats such as parmesan filet mignon, parmesan prime rib, garlic sirloin, chimichurri steak, ribeye, lamb, chicken and sausage. They also have a buffet of salads, cheese, breads, rice, and lasagna. Their pineapple and corn bread is delicious."}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday; I was very satisfied with the service. Although the restaurant was at capacity, there was always a cut of meat on my plate.  Quality of steak - 5/5  Service - 5/5  Salad Bar - 5/5  Price - 4/5 although expensive, I thought it was worth it."}
{"text":"I arrived on time for my 6:30 reservation (under a coworker's name) and was told that they had no reservation for that time and name. Panic ensued as there were 9 of us coming and it was a Thursday night and the place had started to fill up. After frantically messaging my coworkers, I asked the hostess again if there was a reservation for 9 at a different time, she casually said, \"Oh yeah, there's a reservation for 9 for (coworker's name) at 7\". Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?  Meats were juicy, well seasoned, and cooked to medium. The chickens (parmesan chicken and chicken drumsticks) were too salty which was a shame because they were cooked well and not dry at all. I enjoyed the steak with cheese the most. The buffet/ salad bar was a little lackluster and could have used more variety. Also, for the price they charge ($40+ a person), I would have expected more options for dessert other than the grilled pineapple.   Tip is included in the bill, and there is free parking after 7."}
{"text":"I am not a complainer when it comes to dining out, but this was by far the worst experience I have EVER had with a restaurant.   Me and my friend made a reservation because we decided to come here for Summerlicious. I don't know if that was our first mistake? But we've gone here during Winterlicious and had a great time. We arrived early and they were able to accommodate us early. We are greeted by a very friendly waitress and we begin getting our food at the salad/food bar. The food there was good - I had no problems when it came to getting my own food. But the issue was the meat...   There was none... We were literally ignored for the first 20 minutes while we were eating all of our food from the snack bar. I would have understood if there was no servers going around serving other people meat, but that was the problem - They were serving all the surrounding tables meat and not us. We literally timed it on our phones and watched the servers give us eye contact and ignore us. The waitress comes back and asks if everything is alright... there is an awkward pause - \"We don't have any meat!\" LOL! We are trying to explain to her that we don't understand why the servers don't come to us when they see us. She clearly sees that there is no meat on our plate so she goes off to see what's going on in the back.   When we finally get served, one of the servers asked us why we are complaining about them.... HONESTLY?!?! We weren't trying to complain, we were literally trying to get some meat on our table. Only 2 or 3 out of the 5 or 6 servers ended up serving us during our stay. One of the servers literally slammed the meat on our table and just sliced away... didn't even ask if we wanted some cause he was probably informed that we were the 'complainers'. The other servers continued to ignore us. At this point I don't know why we were still being ignored... At one point I felt like I was almost being discriminated against (We were visible minorities). I didn't know if it was because we came for summerlicious and they just treat these types of customers differently, or if it was because they didn't like the fact that we asked why we didn't have meat for the first 20 minutes of our stay.   In the end, we only got LESS THAN 10 PIECES OF MEAT ON OUR PLATES....That's right - I paid $40 to get poorly treated in a restaurant where servers were ignoring us for whatever reason. They also kicked us out after 90 minutes - while my plate was still full of the carby food from the snack bar. I left the place still hungry, unsatisfied, angry, upset and almost in tears for the way they treated us. Never again will I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"if you are meat lover and like to try different kind of meats and flavours then this is your paradise. abundant of tender meat made to perfection served at your table and don't mis the pineapple it's so delicious"}
{"text":"Friend ate from the salad bar, in hospital with food poisoning. Avoid."}
{"text":"Recently hit Copacabana and this last visit may have even been better than my first!   6 out of 5. Yeah that's right."}
{"text":"toronto doesnt have have a good brazilian bbq joint. this is no exception. this is one moment we should be jealous of our american cousins.....  - oversalted meat. bad - cinnamon dusted pineapple. good. - expensive pricing. bad. - attractive wait staff. good."}
{"text":"With live entertainment a 10 minute dance routine while you dine is a nice touch. The principle is simple-a card indicates when you are good for more or you need to stop. If you have no holds barred on meat, then the plethora of lamb, chicken, and beef and it's many different cuts and flavours are amazing. My fave is the Parmesan sirloin. Well, it's really all good. And the roasted pineapple cinnamon is a nice way to end it.  Atmosphere is busy and the staff really go out of their way. If you have a preferred cut or taste let them know. They are very glad to help. Reservations a day before are your best bet.  Only consequence is the protein overload. You want to try all the flavours. Or at least I do every time I go. Come hungry."}
{"text":"4/5 - Damn delicious  Copacabana is best summed up as \"reliable.\" It's a lot of meat, served in a lot of ways.  I love this place for groups. You all come and get to indulge in meat however you want.  My biggest problem is the service can not only be slow, but spotty. I went recently with a group of 16 - our side of the table kept getting the parmesan-covered meat, while the other side did not. On the other hand, that ignored-side kept getting the bacon-wrapped meat, whereas ours did not. We had to repeatedly ask for it before it finally came.  So yeah. Delicious, reliable, but you need to keep an eye open to make sure you get to try everything."}
{"text":"Went there for my best friends bday dinner, the sides looked like they been sitting there all day, and not enough selection on meats, was told when we got in, that there would be 7, the entire night only different types of beef was served, and had chicken served twice with two different seasonings, and bland salmon served once. The food is over salted especially the beef, and the majority of meats and sides are seasoned with only salt. All the beef is rare, you need to request it well done if that's not your thing. Desserts are sold separately, not sure what the $40 you pay is for. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Beef with infused cheese.  There's really nothing more I need to say.  took away one star because I hate places that don't take weekend reservations..."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people for a friends birthday. (Apparently, your meal is free if it's your birthday). I would say the place is definitely not hard to find. However, parking can be tricky for first goers. There is a designated area for parking - I believe it charges you, but if you go to the greeter at the front of the restaurant they will help you waive it off. How the whole process goes - I'm not sure.   So when you walk in, you are greeted with a stage which is pretty awesome because you get live music/performances! I have been to a few brazilian steak houses and this one is probably my favourite. There's quite a bit of variety and they have added extra ingredients like parmesan cheese onto their meats - which is genius, in my friends opinion. I also don't like my meats (beef) cooked too well. And they do this perfectly. My only concern is that some meats are quite salty. There were also particular meats I didn't enjoy - I believe braised beef being one of them. The salad bar is good - nothing too special. My favourite is always the pineapple - as is with everyone else at the table. I also loved their fried bananas. My friends also loved their cheeseballs. I'd definitely pick this place again over the others.   Service was alright. Sometimes one or two of the servers seemed a bit too stiff, but they are running around afterall. I really enjoyed the live performance though. Excellent way of incorporating entertainment into the dining experience. One issue that I did have at this location was the television. Although I didn't really watch it, one of the television was located directly behind a vent. So it's basically blocked. Whoever wishes to watch anything from there, will have a difficult time."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, but overpriced. We come usually during the \"icious\" periods, where you get a few bucks off. I've been to a few Brazilian Steak  Houses (including Fogo de Chao), and I prefer the other places to this. I think this may be the only option in Toronto though (that's why we do return).   My main complaint about this place is the organization. You'd get fairly long periods where you are served the meats maybe only once or twice. And then you'd get periods later where its coming at you from all directions. It'd be much better if it were more uniform.   Also the live music is too loud to the point where you won't be able to hear your dining companions. It'd be one thing if the music was good, but it sux! Although there were a few older people who seemed to enjoy and were getting their groove on on the dance floor.   The meat quality itself is decent. Again its not consistent though. Some pieces are much too salty. The quality is okay, but they compensate by adding lots of flavors. There were a few cuts that I really enjoyed (generally the thinner sliced pieces).   Service is generally quite friendly, and we do usually get asked once or twice if we have any particular requests.   There is free parking in the lot behind the restaurant. You need to provide your car detail (including licence plate) when you check in."}
{"text":"I was here last weekend for a birthday. There is tons of street parking and underground parking nearby. We had to wait a few minutes for our reservation as they were waiting on some customers to leave to setup our table. Once we were seated we went straight to the buffet. They have an amazing salad selection and hot items such as the delicious Mac and cheese. I was careful not to fill up though. Constantly people were coming around with different meats to devour. They were all so friendly and informative. If you are a vegetarian or don't eat beef, you may not get your bang for your buck. My favorite was the spicy chicken though. So so good! And all the meats were piping hot. The grilled Pineapple was a hit! And since dessert is not included that was a great alternative. It was so hot and had cinnamon on it that made it taste like pie. All it needed was some ice cream. Oh and the corn muffins were my favorite. I had like five. It tasted like a sponge cake. The best I ever had. They also have people singing and women dancing but I wasn't really focused on it. It is really pricy though and does not include drinks and dessert which I feel it should. Or at least soft drinks. Definitely a good time though but be prepared to sleep after. I have no idea how people come here for a bachelorette and go party after."}
{"text":"I struggled with whether to go 2.5 or three stars for this place, & I admit I was influenced by one of my two inexperienced dining companions, who sincerely felt that this was the best place he'd ever been to.  For me the price and quality were just way out of whack, and the service was just barely passable.   The various meats they brought around to the table range from good to not horrible to weirdly inedible, and as far as steakhouses go, the quality of meat here is somewhat akin to the now defunct-for-a-reason Outback Steakhouse.  Meat-wise, think one step above Ponderosa or M&M's, yet definitely not even up to the Keg standards. Mention Harbour 60 or Jacob and Co. in the same sentence and I will merely laugh in your general direction.   The people who give this place five stars are the same ones who think Mandarin is the epitome of real Chinese food, and who helped vote Pizza Pizza to be Ontario's favourite pizza.  That said, it was a fun atmosphere with the live guitarist and occasional dancers, the unlimited steak-from-a-sword was a fun idea, a couple items from the buffet were ok, and a few of the meat cuts, (sirloin, lamb) along with the grilled cinnamon pineapple, were yummy.  If this was a typical $28 Mandarin-priced buffet, I would give it 4 stars, but at double the price, it's just simply not twice as good, and barely gets a slightly-generous 3 star rating from me."}
{"text":"Came here after a long anticipation and hearing only great things from others about the experience. I'm a big BBQ fan and so this would be something different but nonetheless, interesting.  I actually found the actual food to be underwhelming. Having to reach over other people's plates to grab a piece of food from the gaucho because either they are told to do it this way or because moving around the table was an inconvenience was definitely awkward. On top of that, I found the tone of some of the gauchos to come across as if we were an annoyance to them because we were new to the Rodizio-style of serving the food, while others were really cool and did actually make rounds on the table and not just stand on one end.  What I did enjoy? I thought the beef selections were real good, but anything with Parmesan was just wrong... I think they use the cellulose laden crap and not the parmiggiano reggiano stuff. The cheese bread ball things were real good (I could hear others in our table of 10 wondering if more would come) as well as the pineapple. The deep fried bananas had very little taste, maybe they should roll them in some sugar before serving?  Oh, and someone tell the house band that bass solos are not cool, but the dancers were neat.  For a total of approximately $57, was it worth it? For the experience, yes, but those gauchos really ruined what I otherwise could have overlooked."}
{"text":"There was certainly a ton of food going around tonight at Copacabana steakhouse. Waiters cut slabs of meat table side to the sounds of live spanish guitar.   Of all the things I ate (and there were ALOT) the BBQ'd pineapples were the standout dish.  They are BBQd with cinnamon. HEAVENLY.   The meat dishes kind of blended together.  I think I liked the flank steak the best. The chicken drum sticks were good too.   I wasn't crazy about some of the flavour combinations, like the steak with parmesan cheese. Also, I found many of the cuts to be very fatty. Like mouthfuls of fat. I ended up taking another plate for the fatty bits.  The salad bar was good.  The corn muffin was yummy.  I didn't love the fried banana.   All in all I say the atmosphere at Copacabana is fun, the food is ok. I came here for a birthday with a very large group. I think this is the right place for that."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Copacabana and I'm so happy that the menu stayed the same (at least from what I know). The only difference is price and who would not appreciate a $10 reduction in their AYCE menu? Total came up to $35 per person (no including tips and taxes). The restaurant was completely booked for a Sunday evening (which is a good thing) but luckily we were able to sneak in a 7:30pm reservation. Parking is honestly a headache so save yourself the trouble and come at least 20 minutes earlier. Yes, it will be paid parking but many parking lots around the area. From what I've heard the restaurant has changed a bit (or maybe it's just for summerlicious), where staff comes around with different types of meat and giving everyone a small portion. In the mean time, you may choose to fill your plate with food from the salad/pasta bar. I'm not going to lie, I got full within 30 minutes. This is literally AYCE meat and for anyone who can last 2 hours, you have definitely eaten your money's worth. The pasta/salad bar was mediocre at best, while nothing was horrible, the salads did not present anything special. I remember the cheese bread because it looked so unique but too much for my stomach (I was getting super full). The meat is really the selling point for the restaurant and some of those steaks were YUMMY. My only complaint is that some of the meats were really salty, especially the chicken. You will never hear a complaint from me about any of their meat being bland because they were heavily seasoned. We also ordered the fried banana as dessert and damn, I wanted more. They also serve a special pineapple that is not sour at all, quite sweet because of the cinnamon topping.  I just want to mention that when someone comes to your table with meat, hold up your little utensil to catch the bits falling off.  I made the mistake of just watching in awe and the guy kept pointing to my tongs...I'm thinking, yeah okay you do it LOL.  Service was so bad I almost cried. Waitress came over to ask if we were going to order drinks so I said give us a little bit of time. She never came back to check on us so I'm like screw it, I don't need any alcohol tonight. She was honestly nowhere to be seen and we got so tired of waiting that we were piling plates so that our table would be clear. Eventually she did show up to do her job. Our waitress was very nice but I wonder if she was overworked because she was never around. The atmosphere of the place was amazing, with a live band behind us it was definitely a place for celebrations. It was unfortunate that they sat us right near the band because we couldn't hear each other beside the bass lols. Anyways, that's not their fault - more of a seating issue. Well into the night people were still lining up outside for tables so this restaurant is quite popular!"}
{"text":"Went back for my 2nd anniversary with my now husband!   Surroundings. Definitely this place has not been updated whatsoever. Chairs are ripping and cut into my thighs. So uncomfortable.  I tried looking for any other chair that was not ripped and there were none. Horrible. The place was like a giant food court/cafeteria. Sitting right next to strangers is not my idea of romance. Luckily I made a reservation and we got a table by the window away from the masses. *one star off 5*  Service. Beyond horrible. The dozy waitress did ABSOLUTELY nothing for us. We cleaned off our own table TWICE and TWICE moved dirty plates to the next without ONCE her noticing and clearing it. She refilled our water once never to return. *another star off 5*  Food. Got seated and went to get the salads etc then came back and waited around 15 minutes when our food was cold to even get the meat man by!! I had to get up and threaten to leave and THEN the HOSTESS who seated us got the ball rolling. We got no cornbread at our table. From reading previous reviews, we were supposed to have cornbread. Ok now, so the meat was tasty. Well not the parmesan chicken, that was horrific. We only got offered about 7 of the supposed 16 meats. All of that filet mignon wrapped with bacon was nowhere to be found, nor shrimps, nor sausage or any of the rest of the good stuff. Instead they kept coming around with the EXACT SAME STUFF. Why are you charging full price for half the offerings?? Nonetheless my husband stuffed himself and I was full and that makes me happy. *3rd star off 5*  I left a $4 tip and that was only because I gave $100 bill and a $5. Total was 101. If it would have been 100 I would have left 100. The person who actually deserved a tip was Carlos the meat guy. He was fantastic. Thanks Carlos. To be honest, HE was the server and HE deserves ALL tips not these dozy sluts who have no clue what customer service means.  We will not return to this location and neither will anyone that we know."}
{"text":"Copacabana is a great AYCE Brazillian steakhouse. I've had the pleasure of visiting these kinds of places across Canada, the US, and even in Brazil and I can say that Copacabana is a very good option if you like this kind of experience.  While it may seem expensive, it is actually fairly middle of the road when it comes to places like this. Consider that you are getting all you can eat of the better cuts of meat available.  As with all Brazilian steakhouses, it's always a pleasure to finish the night with roasted cinnamon pineapple!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So let's start with the good: The staff were great. The waitress we had was nice and attentive, and the meat carvers were friendly and all-smiles. (The carvers were actually Brazilian too, how authentic!) The buffet of other food was fine. Some of the salads were too sweet/overwhelmingly citrus for my taste, but the cooked broccoli and the beans and rice were tasty. Also, make sure you ask the waiter/waitress for cheese bread and corn bread. It doesn't sit at the buffet, they bring it to you fresh and warm, but it's included in the price and is so much tastier than the bread sitting at the buffet.  Also, GRILLED PINEAPPLE. Save room.   The less than good: For some reason, all of the meat was served rare (medium-rare at best...but even that's a bit of a stretch. There was lots of blood on my plate). I told our carver that I like my meat a bit more well done (which I realize now were a poor choice of words... I should have said \"cooked a bit longer\", as I don't need my meat to be well done, just closer to medium than what was presented). He was very nice about it and said he would bring me some more well-done meat. Well, as expected, he literately brought me well-done meat (again, my fault for my poor choice of words). But I didn't mind, it was actually quite tasty and juicy. Unfortunately, the non-rare meat came around about 3 times and that was it. I should have stocked up and taken a ton of meat the first time it came around. Ended up eating a ton of delicious pineapple to make up for it.   Now that I have learned more about this place, I would probably have a better experience next time... ask for medium and stock up the first time they come around, rather than waiting to have a bit of everything.... but hey, if you like rare meat (as my boyfriend did), you will probably love it."}
{"text":"Looking for slow, spotty and surly? Look no further!  The good: some of the staff are helpful and friendly (mostly near the buffet). Some of the time the food is tasty (not every time).  The so so: parking is tough here.   The bad: It took 30 mins to receive our final requests. We kept being reassured that it was coming, but everyone other than us received our requests!  We never received half of the meats that were available.  The manager was patronizing and useless.  At least one gaucho was intent on correcting our use of tongs.  Bags are apparently not allowed to be near the tables and instead 'kept' at the front desk. They are not attended here."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, and a great ambiance. Definitely an authentic churrascaria experience! If you love meat, this place is a must go!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto! Impeccable service usually, great variety of meat, chicken and lamb.. Every time I go there I remember why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We went there tonight as a group of four people. We were at the door at about 6:15 and they seated us only after 8. The long wait was the only unpleasant experience that we had there. They have a great salad bar with warm and cold salads and appetizers. All the meats that come to the table are perfect. Everything was tender and yummy. The grilled pineapple is awesome. I also loved the corn bread and the fried bananas. The waiters and waitresses are nice and caring. The restaurant is so crowded and yet the waiters remember your preferences and bring your favorites back to the table. Also, they care about everything that you ask for. Such nice people. Besides all that, the Brazilian dance was performed nicely too. It is a bit pricy but is definitely worth it. The bill for two people + tax and tip was about $110."}
{"text":"I've had this place in Niagara Falls and in Toronto.   The concept is admirable and cool, although the food is net very fresh in the salad bar. Don't try to order a drink cause you'll only see your server once when you enter the place then they'll disappear for the rest of the night until you need to pay.   The Niagara Falls location is more fancy.   I found that the meats are very tough to eat and the marinade is not flavourful or maybe there seems to be either too much salt or too much of certain spices which makes the flavour not uniform.   Your better off flying to Argentina  lol"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both experiences I was very pleased with.  Pros: - Very spacious setting - excellent choice for a group event  - Delicious salad bar buffet with lots of items to choose from ranging from pasta, cheeses, hams, dips, and more  - Belly dancing show on weekends  - The waiters who serve the steaks are very well-mannered  - Wide variety of steaks served, including beef, chicken, and lamb   Cons: - Can be pricey for some ($40 weeknight/$45 weekend per person) - Steaks are usually cooked to rare; might not be everybody's preference"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Came here for a birthday with a party of 5 and enjoy every minute.  Definitely a special occasion restaurant due to AYCE, price, method of eating and fun atmosphere.  Our table came in with presents for the birthday girl and I noticed that a great number of other tables had similar signs of celebration.  When the live musician sang happy birthday, at the part where a name is usually supplied, he just kept strumming and let the room fill in the names... there were so many people who were celebrating their birthdays that day!  The great help yourself salad bar is a great deal more than that!  Lots of choices for veggies, soup, pasta, and a delicious paella loaded with seafood.  Loved the plentiful avocado chunks with red pepper that were just calling my name.  Try not to get too filled up with at the salad bar because the meat is still to come!  The meat... wow the meat was amazing!  Though there were a few misses (garlic steak was a bit too well done), pretty much everything was on the ball.  Tender, fatty top sirloin, yummy chicken dumbstick, absolutely amazing skirt steak, bacon wrapped turkey, sausage... *drool!*  Side note: our table girls kept giggling over how absolutely good looking all the male waiters were... one of the criteria for employment must be looks.  Must!  They even looked as if they were personally rejected whenever we declined their offer of meat!  That's neither here nor there though.  :D  One grabs the meat with tongs that are provided for each person as the gorgeous waiters slice up your choice of animal.  Oh, don't miss the sweet, sweet cinnamon dusted roasted pineapple!  Ohoh!  Don't miss the corn bread muffins or the deep-fried bananas either!  There were some performances while we were there that helped end a really great time.  The service was prompt and great (waiters would ask us if there were any meats that we hadn't received yet and go get it for us), the quality of food was excellent, the atmosphere was really fun and the entertainment gave just that added value.    Get there early or it may be hard to get a seat.  We came on a Friday and by 530pm the restaurant was already full of people.  They don't take reservations for less than 6 people.  Lots of free street parking around the area, if you can find an empty spot.  Otherwise, lots of Green P.  I found the CanPark lots in the back of the building a bit of a scam though (broken machine, no cashier, machine that keeps adding money even though you've reached the maximum).  Skip them if you can!"}
{"text":"This place is buzzing with excitement... from live dancers at 11pm every Saturday, to an abundance of meat and salads.. You really can't go wrong!  The only reason why I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5 is that the meat could be, at times, too salty for my liking.  The salad bar is also smaller compared to their downtown location.  Nonetheless, this place excites... If you're looking for great value ($40 all you can eat meat), then look no further."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant. The food tastes great, although extremely salty. The Parmesan chicken and the cheese steak are phenomenal. The side dishes are just okay, some veggies options, fries are decent, but were cold last time i tasted them. The meat keeps on coming, and you get to try all of them. The salads are good too. One thing that stood out was the sushi, why would there be sushi at a Brazilian restaurant, nonetheless, I still had a few. The waiters are attentive and work very hard. Also, do not leave without trying the cinnamon toasted pineapple. It's extremely sweet, and extremely good. I like the interior, and the place looks pretty clean. The only thing is, be prepared to spend upwards of 60-70$ per person comprised of a drink, and a desert. Also, not all meats are available during the weekday dinners."}
{"text":"first time here and i was MINDBLOWN. u legit have to try this place at least once.  okay all the meats are fantastic but my two favs were the boneless beef ribs which were super tender and then the prime rib infused with cheddar cheese like WTF. meat with cheese, yes please! honestly i would pay to just go back n be served just the cheese meat lol because it is soooo good!  enough about the meat let me get to the carbs. The cheesebread and cornbread muffins! don't get me wrong, i love my meats but the cornbread was DIVINE. it comes out hot and fresh and is for sure the best ive ever had. i was thinking about it for days after lol. The cheesebread, there's two.  One in the buffet area and it's infused with a thick layer of cheese  right in the middle. MY. GOD.  The other one comes out hot and fresh. It's like a cheese ball puff, really good as well.    The buffet area has quite the variety of salads and random cold dishes.  There's also lasagna, mac and cheese, rice, shrimp, mash potatoes.  I probably had about a whole plate of their mango salad.  finally, the dinner finishes with the grilled pineapple.  the BEST PART of the whole experience and I would save the most room for this.  It's grilled with cinnamon and sugar i think and is just absolute HEAVEN. i had no shame asking for the most slices. I would come back and even do the vegetarian option and not eat any meat just so i can eat the carbs and pineapple."}
{"text":"Super fun, delicious and great atmosphere! Great choice to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. Lively and entertaining!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Copacabana tonight to celebrate birthdays. We didn't know the restaurant offers free parking after 7pm, we weren't notified ahead of time, so everyone paid already. (They don't reimburse)  The hostess wasn't really cheerful, but our servers were all quite nice.  There's a salad bar section towards the back of the restaurant, which offers lasagna, mac&cheese, mash potatoes and bread for carbs. There were spinach with berry dressing, caesar salad, mixed greens for the veggies.  And a variety of cold sides, such as coleslaw and quinoa.   In terms of meat, there are 14 different types of meat, which include ones such as filet mignon with bacon wrap, beef flank, lamb, spicy chicken or even chicken/beef with parmesan cheese coating.   The outer skin is quite flavourful, but really salty. Most of us had to keep refilling our salads to balance the sodium intake from the meat. The meat they prepared is quite juicy and good, we just wished it was less salty.   They also had bbq pineapple, with cinnamon coating. Probably the favourite choice amongst us tonight. The servers also came around with corn bread, which is a small cupcake/muffin pastry, nom! that was delicious!  Overall, I'd say your $40-$45 would be worth the money if you enjoy a lot of meat, and don't mind sodium-overdose. For an average girl, it's likely not the type of meal you're looking for typically. Or you can opt for loads and loads of salad :)"}
{"text":"Let it be known I am the biggest carnivore chick you will ever meat hehe. No, seriously I love my meat, and when I first heard of the wondrous idea of an all-you-can-eat meat restaurant, I nearly died and re-lived again. I've gone here quite a few times over the last few years, and the only thing I've got to complain about this place is that the washrooms are creepy, dark, and small.  Might I add they have the BEST Pao De Queijo's EVER? I'll take the entire grilled pinapple please, forget everyone else.  Come with an appetite cause its expensive so you better eat worth your money."}
{"text":"Overall I would give this place a 3.5/5.  Meat, meat, and more meat. It's all you can eat. If you love meat this is the perfect place for you. By the time we left I was so full. They have a large variety of different meats including: chicken, prime rib with cheese, chicken drumsticks, beef ribs, pork ribs, pork sausage, salmon, shrimp, many different cuts of steak like top sirloin, filet mignon and rib-eye. At the end of your meal the serve yummy roasted pineapple. This has brown sugar and cinnamon which has been caramelized to make this a really awesome way to end the meal. All the meats were cooked very well and still juicy inside. My favourite dish was the top sirloin.  For those who aren't big meat lovers. They have a good salad bar and other hot dishes. The salad bar has a good with a variety of different salad such as kale, potato, pasta, couscous, chickpeas, beet, tuna, Greek or if you didn't like that you could choose to make your own. There were also some hot items like mushrooms, vegetables, macaroni pasta, and lasagna. They also came around with corn bread.  The waitress and the servers were great and very attentive. They were quick to bring out the food and clear our plates when we needed them to.  My one big complaint about the restaurant was how loud the music was. Even when there was no performance it was loud. We were seated at the front where the speakers were so it was super loud. I could barely hear what the person across, and beside me was saying without having to shout. When I asked if we it was possible to turn down the music the waitress told me no, and that it would only get louder.  For the live performance they had some dancers come out and these guys who did some cool martial arts moves. They also have some singers playing live music and singing.  Found some of the food to be very salty. I was still very thirsty after the meal, even though I did drink a lot of water throughout the meal.  I would say give them a try if you've never been a Brazilian steakhouse before, just drink a lot of water and get seated closer to the back. Make sure to try to pineapple!"}
{"text":"My fiancé & I celebrated his birthday here on the weekend. We loved the rodizio experience & especially loved the pichana cuts of beef! We also loved the show & the salad/buffet bar selection.  I hope to come here again someday soon- the Summerlicious experience was totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Feeling like steak? Don't go wasting your money on the keg or other steakhouses. This place is by far serves the best variety of meat AND the greatest part is it's all you can eat!   The atmosphere is quite unique with live performances nightly. Waiters come around to the tables with different types of meat fresh off the grill and served to you right off the skewers. The cornbread is likely the best in town so don't forget to try them. And be sure to leave some room for the grilled pineapple - to die for!"}
{"text":"Went to the resto on a Thursday. A small complaint about the host was that she didn't receive people in a timely manner at the front. It seemed like no one was working there for the first 10 minutes of us waiting around. But it could have been that someone didn't show up. It wasn't too busy and  at all. We even caught a little bit of the live show which involves singing, live music and dancing. They did sit us in the deepest corner of the restaurant so we didn't get to see any of the dancing. Just to to hear loud hooting nad hollering from the other patrons. The salad buffet was pretty good. They had a lot of different yummy salads and warm sides for the meat. They were all so good that I think I over ate on the salads and didn't leave room for the meat. The servers come regularily to serve grilled meat from the stick. I agree, the chicken drumsticks were delicious, as was the brazilian steak. We ate a lot of meat and got very full pretty quickly. The grilled pineapple was also very very very very good. It makes me want to have grilled pineapple everyday. I don't know if I will be going back to this restaurant because it is pretty pricy for the service but I would recommend checking it out once."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious and am I glad I put this place on my list! I've been to Summerlicious restaurants where they would adjust for the prix-fix by stingeing on the portion size or using cheaper ingredients. Even the guy with the biggest appetite wanted to flip the card over for a breather 20mins into the meal. Very impressed with the buffet section as well,  definitely better than most buffets I've been to. The fried casava was a crowd pleaser,  but the kale was my favourite. Remember to grab some chimichuri sauce from the salad bar for your steak. The buttermilk rib eye was incredibly tender and flavourful while the cheese stuffed sirloin was coma inducing. Prime sirloin was delightfully fatty and melts in your mouth. The cheese biscuits and corn bread were too delicious to pass up even though I wanted to save room for the meat. The highlight of the night was the roasted pineapple, even though we were stuffed we asked for seconds. The glass of Merlot I had with my meal was reasonably priced at $6 for a 6oz glass and complimented all the red meat well. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant of all time. By far. Even vegetarians would love this place, great salad bar."}
{"text":"I have always heard great things about Copacabana so I was very eager to try it out for the first time. We had made reservations for 4 people at 8:30pm and were seated promptly.  After we got seated, we helped ourselves to the salad bar, which had a wide selection of ham, cheese, bread and fruits.    The highlight is definitely the meat!  It is a Brazilian steakhouse after all. They have a wide variety including beef, chicken and lamb.  All the beef cuts were very tender and delicious.  The cinnamon roasted pineapple is also worth mentioning!  The waiters who serve the meat were polite and often asked if there was something else we haven't tried.  I was very impressed with that.   But one thing did bother my friends and I.  There were two instances where we felt that our waitress was rushing us to leave, which made us feel a bit uncomfortable.  Anyways, I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and wont go into much detail.  Copa is still a nice place and is worth a try."}
{"text":"Come here if you are a meat lover!  This is my first time here at this location - there was a deal with Summerlicious ($35 pp). The food did not disappoint however, I find the same 3-4 meats to be coming around over and over again. I had to request the bacon wrapped fillet mignon (which was AMAZING). Big salad/side dish bar - I didn't pick much from there since I wanted to save my appetite for the meat!! The meat is on the salty side but I didn't find it to be overly salty. We went on a Thursday night so there was live entertainment. Our table was at the front of the restaurant, just to the side of the speakers so it was VERY loud. I had to yell a bit in order to be heard from across the table. I would recommend sitting further away. Everything was really good (I think we tried everything meat-wise, except for the lamb). Compared to the Copa Cabana on Adelaide, I find this one to have more of a \"family\" atmosphere. I personally like the one on Adelaide more - quieter and darker decor. The servers were very attentive and nice. Water was constantly being refilled (strategy to get us fuller faster perhaps? LOL) The meat servers were constantly semi-yelling out \"Lady\" at me when they asked if I wanted the meat.. it sounded a bit weird at first but it kinda grows on you! :) Overall, a very good experience and the Summerlicious deals made it even better. I recommend Copa Cabana to all meat lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Went for the $45 meal of all you can eat meat and it was fantastic. DO NOT ASK FOR WELL DONE! The meat is cooked perfectly the way it is, well done just ruins it.  Do not fill up on salad and sides, there's going to be lots of meat coming around. We found the better cuts also come out later in your meal so don't fill up on the early meat they bring out either.  Was a bit loud which is why this doesn't get 5 stars. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Deliciousness!!! Kind of a late review, but here it goes:   Food: All the different kinds of meat just met my expectations. The best one that I can remember was the chicken parmesan. It was probably the best one I've had so far. I also liked the little dishes they had like the glazed pineapple and sweet plantain. Unforgettable experience.  Decor: Simple but luxurious.  Service: Great."}
{"text":"We were a group of 5 40-something women having a get-together. I have been here several times, but my friends had never been. We went during Winterlicious, so I was a little nervous that the food or service might suffer as it has at other restaurants during winter/summerlicious. It was a very busy Friday night. Our server was very attentive, always clearing plates and getting drinks quickly. The all you can eat buffet is pretty good. Lots of salad items which were fresh. I loved the macaroni salad. There is a nice selection of breads, and on the hot tables there are beans and rice, lasagna, mussels, french fries, mushrooms, and my personal favorite, the mashed potatoes.. There is lots to choose from, but my advice is don't fill up on the salad bar, because the main attraction here is the meats!! Ohhhh the meats. Handsome servers bringing out endless spits of delicious cuts of beef, chicken, pork and even salmon and lamb. Some are rubbed with spices, some have chimichurri sauce on them.. some are stuffed with cheese (again, my personal favorite..prime rib oozing with cheese) Flank steak, sirloin, omg.. tenderloin parmesan which is also delectable. The meat is not overcooked (unless you ask for cuts that are more well done, which they can accomodate) it is never dry... we looooved it. The best part is when they bring out the pineapple.. coated in cinnamon and sugar and cooked on the spit until it gets a crunchy outer layer.. it is SOOOOOO good!! They also come around with little cheese breads and corn bread.. DO NOT miss the corn bread.. we couldn't get enough!! Served piping hot and melting in your mouth, it was a highlite of our visit too. Now the entertainment.. when we first came in there was a couple of guys performing live, they were pretty good, it sets a good vibe. THEN the Brazilian dancers came out..dressed in itsy bitsy Brazilian dancer costumes complete with beads and feather headdresses..Gorgeous girls with beautiful bodies shaking what their mama gave them to Brazilian music. They came around to each table so we could get close up pictures. It was so much fun!! The music makes you feel like you are in another country.. we loved every second of it. Overall, we LOVED our visit to Copacabana.. it's a great place to go with a group of people!!! Go hungry!!"}
{"text":"After meaning to try this place for ages, I finally got the perfect excuse. It was my GF's birthday. We came on a weekday but it was packed already!   The food: The meats are mostly amazing. All the beef cuts were very tender and salted just enough to my liking. The chicken grills were ok. The self serve food bar is good too with many \"healthier\" options to pair with all the meat you're getting. There's stuff like quinoa salad and kale salad. The quality of the salads are pretty good. One day if I feel less glutinous I would like to come just for the salad buffet.   The service: I'm very impressed by their service. They gave us a mini dessert for my GF's birthday. They also took our request to have the performer sing happy birthday. Our table was wobbly and the server tried to fix it. (please get another table).  The atmosphere: Very nice decor. But very loud. Good luck talking in here. But I guess it fits well with their festive theme.  The price point is higher than what I am normally paying for dinner but it's AYCE, good quality, and a special occasion. It's not a place I would come very often, but it's definitely a place I would consider when I want to feel special. The final bill ended up being over $100 for two people.  BTW, they added tip to the bill. It's a forced 15%. I'll overlook this since I'm satisfied and I probably would have tipped more than my usual 10% anyways. I wish they had a dessert section for buffet. Like some ice cream or something. Still giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Copacabana Brazilian Steak House  It was almost a full house when our party of three plus an infant arrived on a Sunday.  There were plenty of birthday people and other large groups celebrating.  We were quite pleased with the ambiance, service, and food.    More about the food!  We of course chose from the all you can eat buffet and cuts of meat.  The going rate was $50 per person.  The buffet had the usual cold pasta salads, green salads, and a Thai inspired salad, as well as a tasty salmon in cream sauce, and other stuff we skipped over.  After all we were there for the unending supply of meat.  We were offered lamb and chicken sliced off the skewer, but passed them up in favor of filling up on the Brasil picanha (BP) aka sirloin steaks.  The first round of BP was quite tender and juicy, and oh so delicious.  After eating some flank steak slices, skirt steak, and other cuts, we said yes to a second round of BP.  I didn't quite enjoy it as much because it was a little chewier (even though it was medium rare).  Our party ate at least 4 different cuts of beef each (all tasty in their own right), and we ended up needing to pace ourselves over what seemed like 21/2 hours.  We met the manager who appeared non-plussed in helping clean up tables, and offered details about Copacabana's other Niagara Falls location (yes they are owned by the same people).  The live music was also a plus and the musicians even took a request to turn up the tempo on the much too melancholy tunes.  As well, we could not help but note how attractive our server, and most of the other servers, and the young men carrying the skewers of meat were.  By intention we're sure, and we have every intention of going back again in the near future."}
{"text":"It gets three stars for friendly staff, the fact that it's a Brazilian steakhouse so the fun dining experience comes with that fact and they also have good live entertainment which does not interrupt your meal in an annoying manner.  But on the food front, this place probably would have got 2 stars. Brazilian steakhouse meat is salty by nature so I'm not going to rant too much about that. But from the actual look of the meat, the below par salad bar (in terms of awesomeness and presentation) to the fact that we kept getting non red meat come up in higher frequency than actual red meat (aka steak) really put this place off track for me. I also don't believe that we got served every single rack, but I could be easily mistaken as once you start eating, it's so easy to not care about what's being brought on to you.   There was one meat item that is stuffed in cheese or has cheese sauce over, which just looks like all sorts of wrong and I had no interest to eat it because a) it looks horrible and b) by the time it was first brought to our table, I was stuffed.   They had suckling pig which was a first for me, and despite my lack of love for pork, I did try it out but found out that that sort of texture was not my thing.   They had the heavenly cinnamon coated pineapple as well as cooked banana which are always a big hit with me.   In terms of the entertainment they had fairly attractive dancers that did their thing and then walked around for photo ops, that was fun and they were very friendly too.  If Toronto had a great Brazilian steakhouse, I would choose that over Copacabana, but until that happens I will stick with this although I won't be eagerly awaiting my return to Copacabana."}
{"text":"My second time at Copacabana. We arrived at around 6:45pm. Unfortunately reservations are not available for parties of 6 or less.  We were told it would be about a 1 hour wait. The hostess took down our name and phone number.  We headed to a Second Cup nearby until our table was ready.  The place is definitely a hot spot for birthday parties. I think I heard enough \"Happy Birthdays\" to last me the year now!    The music is loud with the live band so I would not recommend this place for a first date unless your date has big lungs!  The server explained to us re the self-serve pasta and salad bar, and also about the Red/Blue or Hot/Cold system as to how the meat carving studs magically appear at your table with the exhaustive list of meats...however, they seemed to randomnly adhere to this system as some of the studs still came around when we had our Blue/Cold side up.  Kind of defeats the purpose of having the system if its ignored.  I think I would've enjoyed it more if the pace in which the food was being paraded around was taken down a notch. Half the time the meat carving baddies introduced the dish so fast that I'd wondered if they worked part-time as auctioneers?  Of the dishes I did hear, we had:  Lamb Chop Chimichurri Steak Parmesan Steak Garlic Sirloin Grilled Pineapple (Just delightful!) Cheddar Bread  The meats are all heavily salted but tasty.   At $50 a head it is good value as you do get to sample a fairly wide range of meats.  I deducted 2 stars because I found that the speedy zipping between tables doesnt give you sufficient time to digest, because the servers ignored our Cold/Blue cards and because I had to hear Happy Birthday in a loop."}
{"text":"I love that this place partakes in LiciousTO (Summer/Winterlicious). It's a smashing deal. To avoid the 3 hour wait that we had back in February, my friends and I decided to invite a couple to join us for dinner. It was our annual Christmas in July and we were really set on eating here when we did our Secret Santa gift exchange. As we would be going on a Saturday evening, we needed to have a party of 6 to make a reservation. Thus we invited a couple to join us.  Unfortunately, our friends had double booked dinners and decided to back out of ours.... This led to panic and mayhem. I let the restaurant know that our party had actually decreased in size, despite having confirmed our reservation the night before, and that we were willing to wait for a table but would like to know how long the wait time would be. THEY WERE SO AMAZING, they KEPT our reservation!! We were very thrilled to not have to wait at all!  The service from the waitstaff was equally amazing. We were seated in the back half of the restaurant, so closer to the food, which was perfect for us. We didn't get as good a view of the dance and drum performance, but frankly, we were good without it. It wasn't our first visit, and we've seen the performance several times before. We were brought all the juiciest dishes and when we requested certain items, they remembered to bring them by our table. Our dirty plates were constantly being replaced and our water was topped up every time we emptied a carafe.  I think it's a bit funny that we all went in looking forward to certain dishes and came away enjoying other dishes a bit more than the ones we went in for. I found the salmon to be a bit overcooked this time. My favourites were the Top Sirloin and the Parmesan Filet Mignon. I liked the Chimichurri Steak as well. I really liked the cornbread, and found the deep friend banana and roasted pineapple to be good as well.  We definitely planned for our meal better this time, although I felt full the rest of the night. Will definitely be back, although I think we would all like to try out the other location at some point as well."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good wine. The ambiance was OK, but a tad too loud at times. Try not to fill up on the salad bar as you'll get served a lot of food. Best to book ahead of time as it can get quite busy at dinner time."}
{"text":"The place was fun, friendly, and good food.  I agree with some comments that the meats could have been better quality, but for what it's worth - it was quite a good time for a family outing.   The bonus was the Samba ladies shaking their tail feathers (Fri/Sat only) and the live performers playing, Astrud Gilberto, and Stan Getz (my favourites!) - Wed to Sat only  We sat in the smaller intimate corner near the salad buffet, rather than in the middle which seems a bit cafeteria like.  The servers were quite friendly and the wandering rodizo guys, are quite good at bringing requests of different meats. One guy let my boyfriend's mom hold the stick while we snapped a photo.  The hostess seems really non-assertive and very insecure. Not much of a hostess.   What do you get for $50 in terms of food:   - all you can eat salad bar. Different varieties of cold salad (no labels on them, so had no idea) and soup (no labels, or handles on the lids!) that seemed to change throughout the night   - different meats that come to you on a rodizo stick that they cut off for you YUMS to : brazilian steak (picana brazil) top sirloin lamb  salmon pineapple friend banana cheese bread ball  They also have rib eye, suckling pig (never saw it), salmon upon request  Tip: save your quote for the meats and don't stock up on the breads  All you can eat!  Parking: after 6pm the street east of it called Redpath, and the resdential streets north of it  I think this is a great place to take out someone for dinner, and have something different. Good family place."}
{"text":"So I was dropping off something for a friend near the neighbourhood and looked around to see what is available for summerlicious. They have a salad table, the cheese and basa were not bad. Gives you a break from the meat.  Each table have a paper button to tell the waiter to continue to serve or to slow down depending on which side you flip.  Every time when the waiter comes, you have to have your tongs ready to pick up the meat. They give you small tongs, so it took me half the meal to adjust. One thing I don't like is if there is a type of meat, maybe you had it five minutes ago, they just end up serving the table beside you. Anyways, some cut of the meat were better than others such as the one with the Parmesan cheese and the one with the cheese in it. The flanks and cubes, I find it a bit rough. The cinnamon glazed pineapple was good as they thinly sliced and warm and it was good for dessert.  I did enjoy the dancing show and live band."}
{"text":"Copa Cabana really never disappoints. We've been three times now and it's our go-to for a special occasion. Yes, you're paying a lot but the food is top quality and it's all you can eat so obviously that makes it worth it!   Service: Friendly and fast hostess'. The servers are very accommodating and always willing to get you what you want. We mentioned to a server or two that we were waiting on the cheese stuffed prime rib and they proceeded to return with it for the rest of the night (instantly they were my best friends). They have a time limit on the seats so as expected, they are prompt at getting you out of there!  Food: 5 stars across the board. Such a huge selection of meats but also, side dishes and veggies. I am always excited to see what they have at the buffet portion of the restaurant and have an unnatural love with their garlic mashed potatoes.... really, eat them when you go. Although, it's not good strategy because mashed potatoes are filling and obviously you need room for the meat! Other honourable mentions for food: parmesan crusted chicken, cheese stuffed prime rib, chimichurri steak, deep friend bananas and we developed a strong love for their roasted pineapple as well!  Other comments: I really dislike how hard it is to get a reservation but of course, this just shows what a great restaurant it is. Nonetheless, if you want to go for a special occasion (especially a holiday) make sure you're booking months in advance! Also, the first time we went the cards provided at each table had a list of meats that were provided, it was nice to have something to look at especially for newcomers but the last time we went the cards didn't have the list.   Summary: My concept of a \"special occasion\" has become much more broad so that we have more excuses to celebrate at Copa."}
{"text":"When we went early right when they opened, the food came fast and frequent, the steaks were well seasoned and tasty. I deducted a star because when the restaurant got a bit busier, they kept missing our table, we had to wait 10 to 15 minutes before each steak. They also had an acrobatics show later in the night, don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   The pineapple is to die for! Like If I could have one of the staff just sit there with the pineapple and just constantly give me one after another- I would do it! Obviously, from my gushing words- the pineapple is a must!  The meat selection's were good! Very flavourful and pretty consistent in terms of waiting for the next lovely goodness coming your way. My fav are the Chicken Parmesan and the garlic sirloin steak. Everything else was good but just not as tastebud satisfying as the above mentioned.   I recommend this place to everybody! It's a great experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent! I'm a happy customer for many years! My favourite place for all occasions and events!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Saturday night. .. Sat near the salad bar which in think is a prime spot because all meat came put quickly.  Friendly staff as others have mentioned. Attentive and can by quickly to remove dirty plates and ask if we needed anything.   Meat was tender and juicy, but after a while a tad salty for my taste. The Salad bar was me,  but honestly, your here for the meat.   Live music and dancers.  Would come back but not too often..."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. They have maybe 10-15 different rodizio meat choices. It is a little pricey but hey I cant complain much when I end up stuffing myself to the point of high discomfort, from nonstop round after round of flavourful delicious AYCE meats.  Most choices are steak, some chicken, one each of lamb/sausage/salmon - which we never saw brought out. Some meats are infused with cheese or wrapped in bacon. All of them are medium to medium rare except for the chicken and I would guess also the lamb/sausage/salmon that we didnt get this time.  Another rave about this place is their side dishes buffet bar, serving everything from cheesy bread, naans, mashed potato, lasagnas, mac n cheese to salads, salsas, sauteed broccoli (or mushrooms) that were so good, and lots of cheeses. Usually you try to minimize eating the side dishes, but here its too good to be missed.  They didnt have the Brazilian belly dancers here last night but the other three times I visited on Fridays/Saturdays, they did and it was silly fun to watch as they also interacted with some customers.  One thing they should improve on is serving people who just arrived first. Seemed like the servers kept bringing the fresh meats to their fav big tables first while passing by us even when we just arrived (probably for tips), we were super hungry as it was kind of late so by the time they got to us they were done with that particular meat... and we also sat right by the kitchen... they did redeem themselves a bit by asking us near the end (where we were already full) if we had any special requests for them to bring out, which I could not reject no matter how much I wanted to hurl by this point... so I said \"Yes please, more parmesan crusted chicken, spicy morrocan chicken, and caramlized pineapples!\"."}
{"text":"Ok. Normally I do the story like but I wanna do something else... This was a fantastic experience.  Seating. Comfortable chairs. Comfortable table. Close to the buffet, but with a post blocking us from the stage show. No worries. At the next show we watched from a counter. I think it was one of her few tables without a view, but we worked it out.  Atmosphere: Pleasant from the moment we walked in. People are here for a great time.  Not too loud or quiet. Salad bar: Fresh fresh fresh. Great cold options. Various salads. Cheeses meats olives breads.  Great hot options. The smashed potatoes were great but the creamy sweet potato mash was FANTASTIC! There was more, but honestly I was saving myself for the meat. The meats: Staff goimg through the restaurant CONSTANTLY. There is a way to slow them down. Visit. You'll understand.  So tasty. Marinated and roasted chicken options. And the beef options. Wow. Just incredible. Some were a little salty. I expected this.  Two of the people at our table like their meat well done. A quick mention to one of the servers and they were right on it. And...the staff. Absolutly fantastic.  I cannot mention enough the fantastic service and attention paid to us by Illya. The other staff were also fantastic but he went above and beyond. Cannot stress enough how fantastic an experience. $50 per person. Well worth it."}
{"text":"This place has ruined  my view of all other Brazilian restaurants that I thought where amazing. Where do I begin the all you can eat food, I'm about to burst as I write this. All I can say for the food is I made one trip to the galleria, after that I was at the table. Why? The frequency of the carvers bringing meat to my table was ridiculously fast,How fast? as I was finishing my meat and trying to eat my side dish  I was being offered more meat. I literally never had an empty plate from the time I sat down until I finally tapped out to sit and enjoy my drink and the entertainment. The entertainment is one of the things about this restaurant that will make others seem bland. From the guitarist, to the capoeira fighters this place is an over all experience, and one I won't soon forget."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time recently, and it was even better than the first.  I was a little worried because I noticed a bunch of recent reviews complaining about the service, but we had no issues for our party of six.  Gauchos and servers (exclusively men and exclusively women, respectively - sexist?), were all very attentive and helped direct more of our favourites along to our table.  We were seated near the buffet, which we were a little concerned about, but it just helped to ensure we were never forgotten (maybe that's the secret if it's really busy?).  Anyway, if you want yummy all-you-can-eat grilled meat, come here."}
{"text":"I visited Copa on Eglinton on July 7th. The reason I am writing a review today is because the haunting memories of such a bad experience scars me to this day.   I was in a group of 8 and made reservations a week in advance. Unfortunately for us, we were seated next to the door - along the entrance and in front of loud speakers for live music.   To make matters worse, this location has one of the worst buffet service. After about an hour, the servers stopped bringing food to our table despite asking for it.   For those who's never been, the food is delicious, but you can't really enjoy it when other aspects of dining are not satisfactory.  Thumbs down to you, Copacabana on Eglinton."}
{"text":"The bad: Made a reservation and still waited 50mins to be seated while other parties were. The staff at the door are dismissive and rude at best, including the manager.  The Good: lots of unique types of meat, Steak, Parmesean Chicken, beef stuffed with cheese, Sirloin wrapped in Bacon just to name a few. The waiters come around often and frequently and do their best to get you the food cooked how you want quickly. The Grilled Pineapple was the best thing my table ate, must try ! There are a decent selection of casseroles, veggies and fruits as well."}
{"text":"This WAS one of my favorite places to go until we found out they DOUBLE tax you. BEWARE of this as the prices are already VERY high! I is VERY pricey and they won't reserve a place for you under 6 people, which is kinda unfair, so you have to go early to get a table and they limit you with time if they are over booked which is not fair either. Now just found out that their food is ALL HALAL. I am sorry but there is NO signage saying this anywhere, not online or on the menu. I do NOT appreciate NOT being told this as I DO NOT go to establishments that serve Halal ONLY. That is not right, I have a religion too that does NOT allow me to eat this kind of food and there is NO respect givien to others if they are not informed!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous amount of times, it is a great place to go with the girls! It is around a 8 minute walk from Eglinton station, so it's not too hard to get to."}
{"text":"Went here for a work function a few years ago, but I have fond meaty food coma memories in terms of their cornucopia of meat dish options.  I cannot remember a time where I've stuffed myself so silly to the point of passing out. Between the dozen or so ( I really can't remember) servings, I simply could not resist saying, \"Sure I'll have another....\" - 12 servings later had to loosen my belt, not once but twice.  That's a very occasion for me to gorge myself on such delicious food, coming out so fast and furious.  I would make it a tradition coming out here at least once a year if you're a meat lover."}
{"text":"I had Meat. Lots of Meat. Then More. Beef. More Beef. Another kind of Beef. Moist Beef. Juicy Beef. Tender Beef. Some kind of Cheese in my Beef too.  Some sort of Contraption near the back. Apparently it serves Salads or something... Maybe some Carbs and Sweets, whatev... Nah, stay-in-your-seat.  Eat more Meat!  Watch the Restaurant fill-up quickly... Customers waiting with Hungry eyes. Jam packed smelling my pieces of Meat. Meaty Lamb. Meaty Pork. Meaty Sausages.  + Grill Pineapple to wash down the Meat. + Live Musician provide Rhythm to help me chew the Meat.  Tip: Get there early on weekends. My co-diners actually took some Bread home.  I'll Meat ya there"}
{"text":"I was scared heading here as a person that doesn't eat a lot of meat. Surprisingly, I loved it. I went with a party of 12ish for a work function and we had a reservation. We were seated quickly and there was no delay in drinks arriving.   I'd heard a lot of rave reviews about the corn bread and cheese balls. The cornbread was completely average but the cheese balls were tasty. Could have used butter, though.   I hit the salad bar first. I don't know where the hate is coming from in other reviews for the salad bar. The lasagna was the best I've ever eaten (super cheesy, subtle smokey flavor). The mac and cheese was so cheesy it was stringy but still creamy, awesome. I had some roasted corn salad, a potato and green bean salad, and caesar salad. All were nice, not too outlandish, but seems like good variety to me. There was a field green kind of salad with a spicy dressing that was also a hit at the table. And some kind of salty fried potato thing. That was nice. The salad bar alone would make me go back.  The meat was much better than I expected. We saw way too much of the sirloin. The first three guys that came to the table all had it. It was tasty, though. Tender, very slightly charred, well spiced. When we finally started seeing variety I really loved the chicken. Both morrocan and parmesan were super juicey and flavorful. The pineapple was also delicious.   Overall I loved it and I would go back. A couple things sucked, though. Drink prices are outrageous. If people are already paying $40 for a meal do you really need to charge $4 for a soft drink or $10 for booze? The ayce meat is portion controlled through slow service and small slices so I don't know why they need to make up such a margin on the drinks. The other thing was the manager. He seemed to hate his life. All of the other staff members were great giving us lots of smile and jokes (and the men were all sexy). The manager, though, needs to lighten up or switch careers. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Make sure you come with a big appetite or a way to spark your appetite mid-meal  I love copacabana and the endless supply of meat Brazilian steakhouses like this provide.   With that said most of the meat is not well seasoned so bringing your favourite hot sauce or pepper sauce will go a long way to 'spicing' up your experience.   Most of the meat is great and the grilled pineapple is love at first bite.   If you are on the fence about trying either this location or the Niagara location do your stomach a favour, get froggy and take the leap.  All you can eat meat, you can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going here ever after years of wanting to try it. The ambiance is really nice with dim lighting and lots of seating. I just didn't like where we were seated--it was for a birthday celebration and where we were placed, the birthday boy had people continuously walking behind him and it was a tight squeeze (to the point where he had to move his chair closer to the table just to accommodate people walking behind him).  There was a lot of meats (obviously) came our way, most of which we both enjoyed. We just didn't like how all of them were cooked rare, like I had blood on all my plates which is not a nice view. However, one of the meat carvers was very understanding and even cooked the meat we asked for well done. For the buffet, it was mediocre. The lasagne was actually disgusting, cold (although it was in one of those warmers), dry and just overall very bland in taste. I did enjoy the rice with black beans and the fruit spinach salad (I went back up twice for this).   As for our waitress, she was very sweet and friendly but all I can say is that common sense isn't so common anymore. I had come in the restaurant a couple hours prior to my reservation as I wanted to surprise the birthday boy with a special cake I had ordered. I explained to the hostess that it was a surprise and so we would be ready for the cake after we were done eating our meals. So our waitress now, comes up to my table after we're done eating and asks us if we're ready for the cake to be brought out. I mean commonsense would tell me to not ruin the surprise, so I wasn't very thrilled about that. Other than that she was very sweet but just for future reference, if the cake is supposed to be a surprise, don't announce it to the birthday boy.  We also had plates break right beside our table 2 separate times so I guess we weren't seated in the best spot.   To drink I got the Brazilian sangria which was actually very delicious so I would totally try that again.  Overall, I had an OK time here and wouldn't be opposed to coming back but I'd probably try the Adelaide location which is apparently much nicer."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I visited this Copacabana location last night for dinner (Summerlicious at $35 pp). Before I review my experience I should mention that I have been to the location in Downtown Toronto and the difference between the two locations is of NIGHT and DAY. The other one is probably 10x better in terms of food (both steak and buffet), venue, performances, and service.  Unfortunately, last night we probably got the worst seats in the entire restaurant because the servers with the steaks were literally coming by every half hour. The delay between each serving was so long that I was full after the first two steak samples. It was strange because the table right next to us was getting served non-stop. We were the table closest to the kitchen (how ironic), yet we barely got to have any steak. I knew we were being missed in their rounds mainly because I was seeing various steaks and trays passing by that were never brought to our table for the entire 2 hours we were there. The only positive point about our seating location was that we were close to the buffet.  The buffet was sufficient-had a variety of salads, cheeses, hot foods, etc.   I was really excited to see the performance, but since we were sitting ALL the way to the back (with an extremely obstructed view of the stage), we barely got to see the performers except when they walked up close to our section. Nonetheless, from what I could see, the performance was very good!  In conclusion, I think my experience was not the best because I had high expectations (after going to the Downtown Toronto location). But with that being said, the fact that we barely got to eat steak is inexcusable. I would highly recommend folks to go to the other location if they can. If not, I suggest you ask NOT to be seated in the back."}
{"text":"Posted this on google reviews thought it wouldn't hurt to post here as well:  They called me on Saturday confirming my reservation and I asked for an upgrade from what was originally two people to three as my brother said he'd like to tag along, the person on the recieving end assured me there would be no problems.  We all arrived as our reservation was for 4:30pm and we were immediately seated.  The meat was delicious and my friend who doesn't even like pineapple loved their grilled pineapple! The waitress was extremely attentative and repeatedly asked us if there was any sort of meat we would like to try or request.   The garcons/waiters also asked us if we had any special requests and honestly that is what made me want to write this review, the attention paid to us and to the tables in our close proximity, from what we could hear, was absolutely amazing. From the waiters to the waitresses I have no complaints. Service was phenomenal.  The food was amazing, price was reasonable considering it is basically all you can eat steaks and meats.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like AYCE protein that has been roasted over a spit to celebrate a friend's birthday.  This experience is built for special occasions and it was noted that many people were singing happy birthday.  The meat keeps flowing till you tell them to stop and the salad bar offers a lot of sides that could compliment your meal but that would just be leaving less room for the meat!  The staff are very friendly and work hard to ensure that any particular items you want is followed through from the cornbreads, cheeseballs, and the ever-popular grilled pineapple.  Speaking of the pineapple, here is a pro-tip, the pineapple slices near the core are so much sweet and juicier than the first few rounds of pineapple slices on the outside.  Definitely keep an eye out for that when you get a chance!  All in all, another successful, belly-busting, dieting-destroying meal at Copacabana!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Servant doesn't speak English well and service is awful. Will not come again."}
{"text":"I will never eat at The Keg again after my first visit here   It was amazing if you love meat and lots of meat.    I didn't know what to expect so I ate a plate of the buffet (mistake) don't do it people....just get SMALL sides when the meat comes around and I mean small. I was really full once they started coming around with the meat.   I can eat 22 chicken wings (not alway but you get it) and this did me in when it started to flow.    For 2 people it was $105 total with 3 beers. (Not including tip after)   Service was good and they came by often.    I agree that the food is salty but  it has so much more flavour with everything else going on....that's what beer/water is for anyway. It's just like a bar, they want you to  buy drinks on top of their minimum fee for the buffet.   The meat comes around every 5 mins and had many selections. Why would I ever go to the keg for almost the same price and have 1 cut of meat?  That's all   10/10 and 5*"}
{"text":"I have been to the downtown Copa Cabana location connected to the Shangri-La. I have been wanting to try this location to experience what they had to offer.  Now I must say this restaurant is a major treat to come here for Summerlicious, taking into consideration the regular price. This place is a carnivore's heaven, so much meat. Some selections were a bit too salty for my liking however most of the meat choices were seasoned really well. Note: get some sides from the salad bar/ hot foods bar to accompany the meats because it may get overpowering with just slices of meat. My favourites had to be the sweet steak, the flank steak and the top sirloin. The corn bread is so good here, and it was nice and hot when we got it. Same goes for most of the other foods served, nice and hot.   The major differences I noticed with this location and the downtown location were: This location: -They have awesome live music performances and live dancers and martial arts dancers at this location -Parking is in the back you can fill out the clipboard with your car info at the front desk to get comp'd parking. -The hot food bar was disappointing, their mac n cheese/lasagna was mush, and way too much cheese...all I tasted was cheese.  -Can get pretty loud and hard to talk in the evening -Service was great, no snobby workers and they made sure to check up on us/clear our plates frequently -The meat servers made sure to let us know that they would be back and just needed to reapply the dry rub onto the meat/ come back to us  Downtown location: -The hot food bar is better quality at this location -No dancers/performances when I went -Very nice interior and nice restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner -Does not offer comp'd parking-only saw street parking. -Service was good from what I remembered  All in all, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this place. How often can you get a dinner AND a show?! Both locations offer the same selection of offerings more or less but the experience and atmosphere was more memorable here. Make sure you make a reservation before you go."}
{"text":"I've been to 100 different Churrascarias throughout the US and Canada so I generally know what to expect, but this place was a little different than places I've been before.   First off, the other Brazilian steakhouses I'd been had amazing service, food, and seemed very clean but this place disappointed a little bit when it came to those. The buffet (I would call it a salad bar but it had way more than salad) was very unkempt looked like they hadn't cleaned it since the day before, and the handles were sticky and needed to be replaced and...it just wasn't very appetizing. Side note: I tried to lasagna and it was the best lasagna I've ever eaten before...Even better than my mothers (don't tell her I said that).  Service: Our server has zero personality and we hardly saw her...not impressed. The guys bringing around the meat were nice enough and kept asking if there were any particular cuts of meat we wanted, and they obliged, which was the main saving grace.  Meat: Most of it tasted good, if not a little over-salted, but I was happy with it.  Near the end of our dinner, there were dancers that performed in the restaurant which was very cool to see!  Overall, while the main server and salad bar weren't great (minus 3 stars), the meat servers and dancing and great price (plus 1 star) made it worth it. I'd probably be back."}
{"text":"I Loved this Place. Came here for a gathering which in the end I'm glad I missed.  With that said, Ragi (my female server) made me & my wife feel welcomed and certainly represented the restaurant to the highest professional level. She gave great suggestions on deals, food and drinks  not to mention she was pleasing to the eyes. The atmosphere was very much casual but the decor was good enough for even a formal dinner.  First time here and I WILL definitely return again. Found out on Wednesday & Friday nights they also have belly dancing  , have to get the full Brazilian experience. Lol  Great restaurant, great atmosphere, great people"}
{"text":"I went to Copacabana after hearing so much about it from others, and was not disappointed. The place is all about the meat. So many different types of meat and nearly all were cooked to perfection. You don't necessarily need to eat a ton and stuff yourself to be satisfied, though that is certainly an option! My only complaint is that some of the meats seem to come much more often than others. I would have liked to try an even amount of all of them, as they were all delicious.  The salad bar had a good selection, but was nothing special. The live entertainment capped off the experience nicely. All in all, it's a bit pricey but worth it for a nice night out or to celebrate an occasion."}
{"text":"All you can eat meat, and the best pineapple you'll ever have. Service was overall good, and my party of 6 were provided with plenty of choice of meat. Some said they felt the carvers were skimping more as time went on, though personally, my group didn't experience this. The wine list was pretty reasonably priced (surprisingly), and they were more than accommodating of young children. I'm not generally a live music/ entertainment person with dinner, though copacabana pulled it off well. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers the classic meats on a sword Brazilian barbecue. The selections were tasty and you can eat to your hearts content. The salad bar could be improved upon but its satisfactory.  Don't miss the hot and crazy wild Brazilian dance show.   This is an ideal spot for larger groups as the dinner can be a lot of fun.  The pricing is kind of expensive if you are not a big eater, but the salad bar and dance show is included."}
{"text":"Seems like I've found some fabulous dinner spots lately. this being one of them!  The amount and the quality of meat was top notch! skip the salad bar don't even go there. only useful thing was the olives and pickles to cut the grease a bit but forget the salad bar otherwise.   a few things to note: the special copacabana steaks were sooo tender and yum! the cheese oozing steak was also full of yum. and the grilled pineapples were to die for.   Probably will try to the downtown location - for the seafoodssss!  oh and if you check in yelp, you get 10% off the food, legit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is for the younger generation.  I would not bring young children or elderly people to this type of establishment. We were there to celebrate a 60th birthday.  The musicians were talented, but the music was so loud, even if you screamed at the top of your lungs, you could not talk to the person next to you, and we were seated directly in front of them. That is not an enjoyable experience.  The servers were very attentive with bringing over the skewers of meat, but the meat itself was soooooo salty, that all you could taste was the salt.  The tables of younger people in the restaurant seemed to enjoy themselves. I would not recommend it for those who are looking for a finer dining experience."}
{"text":"delicious and authentic churrasco, attentive wait staff, nice ambience and fun entertainment. pricey but worth it. compared to the american churrascos like texas de brazil or fogo de chao it is quite a bit smaller in terms of their buffet offerings, but you you dont go to this type of resto for the buffet, you go for the meats and they are perferct.  keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"As a predominately Paleo-style eater, the closest I can get to eating like a caveman is this genre (one I frequent) and Copa did not disappoint my evolutionary urges and/or biological nutritional requirements.  I never would've guessed from the picture but the interior was very modern with cool Brazil graphic design and a few mid century touches, and an almost airplane like curve over one section.  We had a bit of trouble getting them to start sending over the meat as were starvingly impatient but the service was very nice.    Bring back the Sword: -Top Sirloin -Skirt Steak Spice Rubbed -Garlic Crusted Steak (a surprise as usually this is weak at other brazilian steak houses) -Filet Wrapped in Bacon -Chicken Drumstick - Great Dark Meat -Some sort of slow cooked pork -Morrocan Spice Chicken Breast   Don't Waste the Space: -Parmesan Crusted Steak  -Lamb - Way too fatty, low quality  Forget the salad bar though a stop by for some  side sauces and horseradish is useful; helps enhance the plainer cuts (especially if they've cooled down)  The live music had  a good sound system; some acoustic versions of Nirvana,  John Mayer and Eric Clapton... umm.. eclectic."}
{"text":"So we stopped here before the Metallica concert. As far as the food is concerned, a great place to have dinner. The steaks are cooked just right (well some were a little too bloody), the variety is fantastic, seasoning is super and the service, FAST and non stop.  My advise would be to stay away from the buffet and concentrate on the meat at the table. The steak with cheese is to die for.  For $48.00 per person it is a little steep though. With drinks I paid $88.00, tips included and that's $20.00 more than I would be comfortable with. Also, for that kind of dough, I would've like a better ambiance. White table clothes et al.   I will go back for the food and the service, just not as frequently as I would've liked to."}
{"text":"There isn't much to fault about Copacabana. It's an AYCE Brazilian steakhouse with over 20 meats to choose from. My group was seated, and given a order sheet. We were instructed that if it was face-up, then servers would continually stop at our table every couple minutes with a different meat. If we flipped it face-down, it signalled that we wanted to take a break. Simple enough.   Along with the array of meats, we also had the option of going to the hot foods bar, which was set up in a typical self-serve manner. It was clearly not the focus of my group or any of the other patrons at the time, as much of the food looked as if it were left untouched for some time. This isn't a knock against the hot food section, but rather a compliment to how good the meats are.   After getting one plate of hot food, we sat down and waited. The meats kept coming and coming and coming. My favourite meat was the parmesan prime rib - I seriously could not get enough. Everything else was also good, but the parmesan prime rib was to die for (it is quite salty though, just a heads up).   One thing that really surprised me was the roasted pineapple. If you have a look at their menu, it lists 20 different meats, and the last item on the menu is simply \"Roasted Pineapple\". We decided to give it a shot, ordering one slice a piece. By the end, we had not one, not two, not three, not four....   7 slices each! They were that good. Roasted with cinnamon, this style of pineapple quickly became my favourite.   We left the restaurant very satisfied, to say the least. Parmesan prime rib and roasted pineapple forever."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2017 dinner ($38)  We visited Copacabana on a Sunday night around 8pm and they were quite packed but It took us not too long to get a table since we had booked a table before hand (make sure to rsvp before showing up!!).  I wasn't a big fan of the hot buffet nor the salad bar; nothing really stood out. The hot buffet offered a selection of carbs (mashed potato, bread, rice, pasta) while the salad bar had too many options of heavy salads. It would have been nice to have some lighter salad choices. The chimichurri sauce was my favourite out of all the buffet selection.   The meat was really the star of the night. As soon as we sat down, we were overwhelmed by the amount of servers stopping by us to serve us. However, the majority of the meat were on the over seasoned and salty side, especially the parmesan beef and the bacon filet mignon. The frequency of the servers appearing was also a irregular: we got flooded with servers in the first 10 minutes but when we started eating, there were no more servers in sight with them only appearing 30 minutes later.   Overall, it was a nice experience but I don't think I would come back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Where do I start...  No \"pao de queijo\" unless you asked. No fried banana, no mashed potato brought to your table.   Buffet selection very poor. No Parmesan cheese and no asparagus to name a few.   Asked for a new plate and the server directed me to the plates near the buffet.   Meat selection is slender and you can't get a cut thicker than a millimeter. Picanha is ok.   Caipirinha was not great. Only had two choices for cachaca and both were Pitu and Leblon (medium quality).  Only positive is that they bring fresh water or sparkling water to your table.   Would never, ever go again.   All the good reviews here just wanted to stuff their faces, and probably know nothing about Brazilian Steakhouses.   My comparisons by the way were Brazilian Steakhouses from Rio De Janeiro and stateside staples such as Fogo and Rafain.   Avoid."}
{"text":"I loved it, my hubby hated it haha They bring a large variety of cuts and the salad buffet it's pretty good, the place it's not very good looking .. But I liked the food, it's a little on the expensive side but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"What? I can't hear you. This room was designed to get the biggest bang for the band! Nothing absorbs the amplified sounds of the band(three musicians, actually) Never saw any Gauchos, just waiters and waitresses in standard black pants, white shirts. I guess th ewait staff can't hear the customers. Special meat requests got  a smile and then a serving of whatever was on the sword. One waitress moved around with a basket of bun like things, which were delicious, but even though requested, never returned to our table of three. She did manage to workja table for 8 quite well (better tip I guess). The sald bar was ho hum at best and the meats were good if you got what you wanted."}
{"text":"The chicken and sausage is boring, Most of the meat is way too salty, some of he waiters skip by you, you almost got to chase them down... The sides aren't very exciting... It's crowded and the bathrooms are disgusting. The atmosphere is ok they occasionally have a Brazilian dancer perform a little gig.... I didn't know if i should tp her or ask for a lapdance, im kidding... However I enjoyed the pineapple and he blond guy was helpful in bringing you all the different meats... I think he was the manager This place gets packed on weekends make sure you make a reservation"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner  Specialty:Brazilian Steakhouse  Menu items: Prix Fixe Rodizio style meats, salad bar and beer  It's snowing outside. The famous Canadian winter is finally making an appearance in this city. It's white, snowy, windy...and all of the sudden, its sunny as I write. Memories of carnivals, delicious meats, warm smiles and rhythms are coming to mind. Brings me back to CopaCabana, not the beach area in Rio, but the Brazilian steakhouse right here in Toronto, on the Yonge &amp; Eligible, I mean, Eglinton area.   A week ago to be exact, I was eating at CopaCabana; a Brazilian Rodizio style restaurant. Rodizio is a style of restaurant service in Brazilian restaurants. One pays a fixed price (prix fixe) and the waiters bring an offering of meats to each table at several times throughout the meal, until customers gesture they've had enough. I would say gesture, because you can't really be at this restaurant without having a piece of meat in one's mouth for more than a second.  Upon getting seated, we were invited to start our meal with an assortment of salads and accompaniments from the buffet-style salad bar.  The salad bar has a variety of salads (cold and hot) to choose from. Soup, paella, steamed rice and even pizza were also part of the buffet. Although I really enjoyed the assortment of this salad bar, I can't really say there was a particular salad that stood out. However, as part of our meal, the salad bar was great and so was the selection. On a side note, my take on the salad bar is that restaurants use this as a tactic to get you full before the meats start rolling in. Makes sense, that is the most expensive part of the meal. Do I justify it? No. Is it upsetting? Not really, its really up to the person to control his or her portions and know that the best is yet to come...   And so it was! Grilled pineapple, in my mind, was one of the best things to pair our meal with. Pineapples wake up your taste buds so that one can enjoy the true taste and juiciness of the meats. In addition to its great nutritional value, Pineapple has a protein-digesting enzyme, bromelain, that helps digestion at the end of a high protein meal; hence why its highly used in Rodizio style restaurants.  Now on to the real deal. The meats! CopaCabana's extensive meat menu made our experience a success. Our table was privy to Chicken Drumsticks, Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin, Beef Ribs, Top Sirloin, Fillet Mignon, Suckling Pig and Homemade Sausage, amongst others. All of them being well cooked, tender when needed and tasty. This was a meat-comatose I would love to experience again.  And if unlimited salads and meats are not enough for you...well then I am sure the beautiful Brazilian dancers might just be what you needed to begin or end your night with.    Viviana."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times and my last visit was terrible.  Servers were sparse and food came by with long gaps in between.  The hostess was rude and the manager refused to honour a promotion.  The pineapple was delicious and so were the fried banana."}
{"text":"One might ask why on earth would a Vegetarian be under the roof of Copacabana... Well guess what? I was right under that roof, and I was very happy with my experience there.  Everyone around me of course had the meats that was carved off by the waiters, but I had the buffet option which was exquisite."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the worst customer service and they are liars. I went there for a dinner with around 30 people and I left a cartier bag behind by accidents (boxes inside and authentication cards with receipt inside) and when I went the next day they told me they threw out the garbage bag.....lol as if someone is not going to check whats inside the cartier bag. They gave me the receipt, oh but I thought you said no one checked inside ? So how come you have the receipt but not the package? Sketchy, just go to the way downtown way better service."}
{"text":"It is a typical Brazilian Churrascaria, quite average in the meat variety. Cheese Rolls could be better as well. All in all a good place for meat lovers. Weekends are very crowded and the place is loud with live music."}
{"text":"I had a reservation booked for quite some time in advance for Augsust 9, 2015 at Copa Cabana (yonge and eglington location) to celebrate my boyfriends 24th birthday. Since the phone call I recieved to confirm my reservation, everything went downhill, fast. The first thing the hostess told me via phone was that there is a two hour seating limit so I HAVE to be out in two hours. I felt like she was kicking me out before I even got there. Her tone was very rude and she knew this dining experience was for a birthday. Anyway, it gets worse then that.   Second of all- maybe its not protocol, however I do believe that when I phoned to make the reservation  it would have been common courtesy to inform me that there would be a live band. Maybe with the phrase of \"we have a live band playing on that night, is this ok?\" The only reason I say that is because they play SO loud I couldn't hear myself speak when I was telling the hostess I had a reservation. I was literally yelling because there was so much noise created by the resturaunts live entertainment. Let me also add that we are not elderly people who are sensititive to noise- we are in our mid twenties. I found the music extremely loud and distasteful, but was willing to accept it as this reservation was for my boyfriends birthday and all he spoke about all week was how excited he was for the amazing food.   We got sat at a tiny little table in a corner with barely any room. I really don't see why anyone would ever want to sit there, let alone sitting us there when we actually booked a reservation. I asked to be moved and the only place the hostess would sit us was at a table right beside the live band after I expressed that the volume physically hurt my ears and vocal cords.   I went back up to the hostess stand to ask if the location on Adelaine could possibly squeeze us in, at 8 on a Sunday. The hostess bluntly said in a very non sympathetic voice \"Sorry. they have no room til 9:30.\" She also then proceeded to say how we are the only ones who were complaining, and nobody else has an issue.   As a server myself, and as someone who has worked in the customer service industry for five years, I know good and bad customer service, and that was TERRIBLE customer service. You should never compare customers like that, making it seen like we are the problem. We were not the problem, the hostesses poor customer service and problem solving skills were. At $40-45 a person, you really would expect excellent customer service, which is far from what we got.   I was ready to give my business elsewhere, when my boyfriend urged me to try and call the other location myself, so I did. I explained the situation to an employee, who said she understood and told us to come through right away. I really couldn't understand why the hostess from yonge and eglington didn't explain the contextual factors in our situation when she phoned, as she just explained it to them as we were just two random people that wanted to eat there, not really stressing the fact that we had a reservation and it was a birthday.  The few employees at the Adelaine location that we spoke to including the one on the phone, our server and the manager were extremely sympathetic, and tried really hard to make us feel welcome. The staff at the Eglington location and Adelaine are like night and day. Its shocking really.   My boyfriend used to tell everyone how amazing the food and service was at both locations, and we were dissapointed beyond words. I have NEVER experienced such poor service in my life"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat meat!!! And really non-stop refilling (stop coming please) :)  Love some of the steaks (not the cheesy and sweet one) and grilled pineapples!!!  Also, if that wasn't enough,  the salad bar will filled you up completely!!! (So many choices.. it is crazy!!!)   The price is superb with the Summerlicious and the WInterlicious deal!!!   and you won't get bored as entertainment will be provided twice during the nite.. (at least twice).  the only recommendation.. order what you want at first.. don't wait that they bring your the items one by one.. cuz you might get full easily... and fast and won't be able to or leave room for the good stuffs :)"}
{"text":"man this is an expensive buffet. the staff is really friendly, from when i sat down they were offering cheese balls and corn bread. also they came around to fill our water and make sure we're ok.  we didn't want to eat everything after a while, so when we were refusing the meat they brought us, they were really nice to ask us what we wanted and then soon enough brought it out.  overall, i'd say the chicken was really good. the ribs had good sauce and fell off bone. the steak, only some were good. i liked the top sirlion, chimichurri steak, garlic sirlon, bacon wrapped filet mignon. overall the steak were quite good.  the pineapple is really good, they must put lots of sugar on it cause pineapple can't be that sweet.  but the BEST, was the corn bread, especially right out of the oven. i'd eat that all night it it was worth the $38.99 for dinner.  the salad bar has good variety but i did not bother eating too much from it except to get the necessary veggies in a salad.  i'd say it's quite expensive, i'd rather just go get a nice steak at a steak house.  there is free parking at night one street south of eglinton.  they also take reservations for large groups (we had 14 people), so it's good for large groups. i didn't see a dessert table though, do they have desserts?"}
{"text":"I had never tried Brazilian BBQ before, and this place was a good place for my first experience. The inside is clean and well kept, and the waiters are especially friendly. Their drinks aren't bad either. I'm normally don't like drinking, but they managed to mix me a drink that was easy for me to handle. I don't know if it was dessert wine or anything like that, all I know is that is was sweet/yummy. There meat is really good to. There are a variety of different meats to choose from. Lamb, Beef, Chicken, you name it! Deserts here aren't as traditional. My cousin likes their fried pineapple!        It's a fun restaurant, it's worth trying out at least once."}
{"text":"So I live and work in Brazil and I know my Brazilian steakhouses. However, this place is not even close to it. There are places in the US (Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, etc) that are a lot better so instead of comparing this churrascaria to a place in Brazil, I'll compare it to one in the US.  I came here with my Brazilian girlfriend for her first time in Canada and I wanted to try this place with her to see if it is actually similar to in Brazil. So we came here along with a friend to try it out.   Let's start with the service. Terrible. Our waitress would stand at one end of the table, reach over to take the plates, pour wine, etc. Instead of walking around the table, she would reach over me as I'm eating to pour wine for my girlfriend. When the meat boys came with the meat, they would stand at one end and make my girlfriend reach over me to get the slice of meat instead of walking next to her so that she could get it. No restaurant should ever do this. This is just terrible service. Also, when our plates started getting dirty, they did not bring new clean ones for us. We had to ask for new plates. They then immediately took our plates away even if we had meat still on it.  Now onto the food. They have a very limited selection of meat. They cooked the filet like the way they should have cooked the picanha. The picanha should have been cooked like the way they cooked the filet. They sliced the filet like they should have done it with the picanha and vice versa. They pretty much messed up the way they cooked and served the meats here. None of the churrascaria's in the US did it the way they do it here which is wrong. They also have quite a bit of meats that had fat pieces of cheese oozing out. Ok. I personally don't like cheese with meats but that is just a personal preference. Others may like it. However, not all of the cheese was melted. Some of it was hard. Almost as if it had been sitting out for a little too long.  There were only 2 dishes that I actually enjoyed. The garlic steak and the roasted pineapple covered with cinnamon. Besides those two, everything else was terrible.  When the dessert came, we ordered the flan. This turned out to be absolutely disgusting. It may look like flan but it was the worst flan I had ever eaten in my life. Granted that I can get some good flan in Brazil but even the places in the US make them properly. The flan here was too creamy and absolutely nasty.   On service alone, I would never come back. Even if the food was good, the service was so bad that it would not be worth going back. But thankfully, I can say that the food was just as bad as the service. There are better places to eat meat in Toronto and this is not one of them. I will never be coming back and will make sure to tell everyone not to come back here. Someone needs to open up a Fogo de Chao in Toronto to show Copocabana Brazilian Steak House how real Brazilian food is done."}
{"text":"I'm extremely tempted to use Shari M.'s rating system here and rate this place the ultimate \"SLAP MY ASS AND CALL ME SALLY!!\" however I have a feeling it would be somehow inappropriate. Instead I'm going to confirm a warning Devan R. gave me when I told him I'd be coming here:  Do not even think about driving or doing any sort of physical activity once you finish at this place! Not only was my reaction time extremely slow, I had extreme difficulty making the move to check my blind spots while attempting to drive back home. I'm serious, it's dangerous.  Now on to the review:  Copacabana, to put it bluntly, is an all you can steak joint but oh man is it good. Live music, intimate setting even though the place is rather large, amazing service and great steaks. I don't even really know what else to say about this place.  When we were being seated, our server notified us of a \"salad / appetizer\" bar in the back but we opted to reserve any space available in our stomach for the great meat to come. The way it works is Gaucho's come around with the different items and if you want it, they carve off a piece and move on. I'm fairly certain in the 2+ hours we were there, we tried nearly everything on the menu (or close to it anyways - and minus the few items that are restricted to certain times of the year) and I loved each and every item.   Everything was cooked to perfection, tender, juicy and seasoned perfectly (one item was far too salty for me but still amazingly tasty). I might have made a mistake to want to fill every gap and crevice left in my stomach with beer and it definitely aided in me gaining ~5 pounds when I weighed myself the next morning.  Regardless it was completely worth it, the price is perfect for the amount and quality of food your getting and the service was just as good. I'll definitely be coming back here again, once I manage to recover."}
{"text":"Came here a few times and loved it each time.  How can you complain about all you can eat fresh meat.  Service is fine.  Ambiance is great!  Love the dancing ladies.  The Parmesan beef thing was ridiculously good.  This place is not for cheapos.  In fact I think all cheapos should not eat out at all.  They should all cook at home and be cheap to yourselves and not bother anyone else.  The salad bar for all you vegetarian losers is good also.  Not that a vegetarian should even step one foot inside this place."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of meats and the carvers don't disappoint, always coming around and offering different cuts. The salad bar is pretty decent too, with hot items as well. Service is fantastic and turns out to be kid friendly too. The only complain is that the music is too loud. Sure it's Brazilian and what not, but it would be nice to hear someone from across the table without shouting."}
{"text":"My wife is Brazilian and wanted to show me Brazilian BBQ.  She searched around and was told this is 'the' place to go for BBQ.  Unless you're going to fill up on side dishes, don't expect to get any value for your money at all.  The place suffers from an identity crisis, part night club part overpriced buffet.  The food is entirely average, nothing spectacular but what absolutely stands out is the fact that every portion of meat I was given was entirely bite size, I literally had already eaten the meat given to me before the guy had even left the table.  I often had to wait 5-10 minutes between 'bites' as they were very busy.  The meat was either extremely overcooked or border line raw (I like rare, this was nearly blue).  As I'm from Texas, I've eaten a substantial amount of cornbread and I can honestly say this was sugar with food colouring and a tea spoon of cornmeal.  We ordered caipirinha's and it was like drinking lime flavoured water with ice and a 1/4 shot of Chacas.  What really gets me, is the $43 per person price tag they charged us for this.  I honestly walked away feeling like I just made a charitable donation to the restaurant on my way to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Warning: EXPENSIVE. Worth it? Yah.  THAT pineapple is one of the top 10 things I'd want to eat for the rest of my life. I didn't think fruit could be that delicious.  Worth going to once in a while, but I definetely can't afford to go there regularly (On weekday expect to pay ~$50 with tax and tip)."}
{"text":"This is probably the best of all the Copacabana locations in Ontario. The restaurant is super packed if you come on a Friday night but they never cease to keep it exciting. There's a live band that plays around 7:30, 8pm. The environment is VERY LOUD. Don't be discouraged by the concertesque volume...trust me, you can live with it as long as you came to EAT!  There is a patio if you wish to go outside, though the real excitement comes from inside the restaurant. Around 9pm, there are Samba dancers and breakdancers that come out and dance all throughout the restaurant. It's exciting and definitely feels like quite the party! The insides of the restaurant are tight - anticipate getting close to your neighbour.  When you turn your coaster to the \"go\" side, food just keeps coming like crazy. More often than not, before you can finish what's on your plate, more meat has come along. Like others before me have stated, be sure to have the roasted pineapple. My favourite meats of them all was by far the sirloin steak and the steak covered in cheese. The latter was more on the salty side, but nonetheless, they were very good. Many of the other meats (in particular, the ones covered/douced in Parmesan cheese) were really salty. Flavour was maintained, in general, even when foods were completely cooked/well done.  Service was great - managers, the men serving the meat, and even the waitresses came around to make sure that you always got what you wanted. Everyone was super polite and didn't make you feel rushed to eat and get the h*ll out.   There's a table full of sides that you can get, inclusive of, but not limited to, lasagna, mac 'n' cheese, caesar salad and other pastas. I tried a variety of the sides. The only thing that I didn't like was the mac 'n' cheese. The cheese bread was good - also difficult to get because people snatch that up.  Go on a Friday night - anytime between 8 and 10pm. It's best to go in a smaller group if you're not used to yelling to speak to the person beside you."}
{"text":"Although you're not going there for salad, the salad bar could use some improvements. I found myself looking for a good side dish to cleanse my palate in between meats. Other than that, I'm a meat lover myself so everything else was awesome. The variety of meat was satisfactory. The servers were respectful and acknowledging. I wish I had a taste of lamb. Apparently they ran out. We were there for 7pm which was quite early and I don't think there ever was lamb. Just sayin. The caramelised roasted pineapple is to die for."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Saturday with no reservation. I had to wait 2.5 hours for a table of 5 and to be honest I was really upset when I sat down. I was told it would be an at most 2 hour wait.  Here's where everything changed. Imagine a restaurant where you have a great steak and by the time you finish off your last bite, a man with a sword of meat drops more meat on your table. This continues for about an hour until you literally have to say \"No thanks, I can't take this anymore\"   In any normal establishment you would stop yourself way before an hour of constant eating. It's extremely difficult to stop at Copacabana because it's actually that dam good.  On Saturday they have 13 different meat floating around the restaurant and you should try all of them. There were some things like the suckling pig that were not brought out unless requested. Look at the menu, make sure you try everything and if you don't see something just ask for it.   Overall great experience and I forgot all about the long wait by the time I ate my first bite. If you want to go on a Saturday, make a reservation and know that in order to get one after 4:30pm you have to make the reservation 2 weeks in advance."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant location to go to. I prefer eglinton over Adelaide any day. Been here numerous times and the meats are always consistent when it comes to flavour."}
{"text":"Lots has been said and said better. I'll just summarize for the few people who are going \"yes, yes, but what does Karl R think?\"  1) No reservations are taken on weekends unless you have a party of 6 or more.  2) Want more meat? Flip your card to Fire Up. Want a chance to catch up? Flip it to Cool Down. Theoretically the Cool Down cards keeps the wait staff away but it does not seem to work. They still come to your table offering you meat. Sometimes somebody compelling is on the other side of the table and suddenly (I would hardly believe this myself if I didn't experience it) a man hacking off hunks of fire-cooked meat with a sword directly onto your plate can just seem an interruption. An actual interruption.  3) It's loud. The live music makes it hard to talk.  4) Part of the fun is interacting with the waiters but the Copa is so busy and packed the meat delivery is perfunctory.  5) Damage for two people was ~$110 with tax 'n' tip. It makes The Mandarin on Saturday night during an Alaskan  King Crab and Looted Persian Antiquities Festival seem like a deal.  6) Lame salad bar. A woman comes around with awesome corn bread but no corn bread at the salad bar's bread station. Whats up with that?"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've been to Copacabana, and I'm still a big fan of it.  Personally I really like that spits of meat are brought to you and then carved, over and over again.  Beware though, one, this place is expensive (happy birthday to me) and two, better get a reservation if you want to come here on saturday or sunday, or else you'll be waiting.    One of the perks of coming here on a friday/saturday, is that there's always live entertainment.  I guess you can kinda factor that into the cost.  We personally heard a string duo (guitar and bass) which was awesome, and then there were these carnival costume wearing dancers that decided to dance around the restaurant.  Kinda neat I guess (I found it really funny when guys would go up and take pictures with the girls).   During the other times, there was a DJ spinning so the place kinda felt like a supper club.  As for the food, depending on the cut of meat, they will usually season and broil the outside of the meat, slice and serve it up, then take it back in to repeat the process.  I found that if you want it rare (like I do), just let them know and they'll do their best.  One thing I've noticed is that they did hold back the more \"premium\" items unless you asked for it.  Personally I kinda wanted to try the suckling pig and shrimp, and I only got them when we asked for them.  So suggestion is if you want it, just ask.  They'll eventually bring it out to you.  As for the non-meat things.  I can't really comment much on the salad bar, I didn't go.  I did however LOVE their corn bread.  It's AMAZING.  I would probably eat it every day and be happy forever, it's that good.  I don't care that it leaves your hands shiny as a mirror after holding it.  That just means it's filled with goodness.  Oh, and the cheese bread balls are pretty damn good too.  As for the amount of food, I can probably say that most people will be stuffed easily (even with the 2 hour time limit).  Personally I would say it's best to come here with a smaller group, so the servers can come to you more often and you can get served a bit quicker.  We came in a group of 17 and it took really long for a server to get from one end to another.    PS... one end of the table will steal all the pineapple and one end will not have any  =(  What ever happened to sharing the anana?  C'est Anana!  Telefrancais!"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving CopaCabana one star.  It might mislead you all into  thinking it deserves a star.  I'd give it zero if Yelp would let me. I would not recommend CopaCabana to anyone.    Most importantly, to summarize my review, they have a surprise two hour limit and they physically kick you out of the restaurant, and they are completely unfriendly.    As background, my friends and I organized a surprise birthday party here.  We made the reservation for 5:30pm and then plan was to have the birthday girl arrive around 6.  As part of this we dropped off a birthday cake for the restaurant to hold for the end of the meal.  I will say that the food was very good.  I was disappointed that in the two hours that we were there, about a third of the meet types never showed up, including the Salmon.   I did love the top sirloin and the flank steak, as well as the cheese-stuffed sirloin!  And the \"salad\" bar was also delicious and had everything from avocados to ziti pasta.  But that's where the goodness ends.   Where to begin my complaints?  * Our waitress was dumb as a brick.  It was nearly impossible to communicate with her, and she managed to mess everything up.  Just as an example, I ordered a Diet Coke.  She brought out a drink and said \"here's your Diet, I mean your regular Pepsi.\"  I said \"really, it's not Diet\" and she said \"Yes, yes, sorry, it is definitely not diet, it is regular Pepsi, not Diet.\"  She was very emphatic that this was not Diet.  To which I replied, \"oh, I'm sorry, I had ordered diet, do you mind switching?\" And she replied \"oh, sorry, my mistake, yes, this is diet, definitely diet, not regular.\"  Ugh.    * Our waitress was dumber than a brick.  The party next door to ours was also having a birthday party and she accidentally brought OUR surprise cake over to that table.  We were looking over trying to signal to her, and it was't until the recipient table told her that it was't their cake that she realized her mistake.  Then, instead of quietrly bringing it back, she brings it to our table and says, to the birthday girl (who didn't know about the surprise cake), \"sorry, I brought your cake to the other table.  Should I just leave it here now?\"  First, way to spoil the surprise you dumb b****.  Second, no, we aren't even half way finished with our meal, go put it back in the fridge.  * The staff was inconsiderate.  You know when two people are walking down a narrow space between tables and someone has to move to the side.  Well you'd expect in a restaurant charging about $50 per person, that the wait staff would elect to make way.  Not here.  It's like playing chicken.  They seem willing to plow you down to get through.  I will say, though, that most of the \"meat  boys\" who delivered the meats were friendly - it was mostly the waitresses who were awful.  * Speaking of waitresses.  What do they do, even?  It's an all you can eat buffet with men walking around with hunks of meat.  Their only role is maybe to bring beverages, as there is no food to order.  And she couldn't even do that.  I was parched the entire dinner, and had to ask multiple times for more water and soda.  * Now for the kicker.  At 7:20pm, the waitress came up and said \"I'm going to bring your cake now since you're almost out of time.\"  We gave her a very confused look as she walked away.  She came out with the cake and dropped it onto the table before clearing out our dozens of plates from the all-you-can eat food.  Not a very good dessert experience.  * But here's where it goes wrong.  At 7:30 she comes over with the bill and says we have to leave.  Now we're confused and she explains that our reservation only allows us to stay for 2 hours, and there is another 7:30pm reservation that is waiting.  First of all, this is a ridiculous policy.  Maybe you can put a 2hr limit on the all-you-can eat, but to physically kick us out of our seats before we've even started on our cake?  We demanded the manager came over and, much to our surprise, he was even more idiotic and inconsiderate .  His name was Jhon Vionot (manager on 6/25 at 7pm) - not sure about the spelling, unsurprisingly he had \"run out\" of his business card.  All he could tell us was that \"everyone knows about the two hours limit.\"  We explained we did not know and he said \"well we  emailed you a confirmation that mentioned it.\"  This is not true, as we did not even provide our email address when we called in the reservation.  No one told us at the time of the reservation.  No one told us when we arrived to the restaurant.  No notice of any sort until 10 minutes before our \"time was up.\"  Complete bullshit.    On top of all this, they included gratuity.    Read all of my reviews - I have very few 1 star reviews, and I don't think any others with so much as a swear in them.  This was truly one of the worst dining experiences of my life and a perfect example of how to ruin a special birthday.   I'm out of space.  Please trust me.  Do not go to CopaCab"}
{"text":"I came to Copacabana for my birthday celebration with my family. We came on a weeknight and it was actually hard getting reservations because of corporate Christmas events. Book in advance if you plan on coming here in near the holiday season! Service was great. Both our waitress and the waiters who come out with the meats were very friendly.   You'll be given a coaster which has red and blue on either sides. Red represents \"NO MORE MEAT!\", and blue represents \"PLEASE FEED ME MORE!\". We successfully went through many rounds of \"Blue\". This is mainly because we had 3 guys at our table, who are competitive carnivores *thumbs up*. Part of the reason why we were able to go through so many rounds was because the \"meat waiters\" challenged the guys' meat-ability. The situation went down like this:  Meat-waiter: \"COM'ON.. CAN YOU HANDLE MORE?!\"  Our tables' competitive carnivores: *insert silent nod* and *flips coaster to blue* hahaha  Highlights of the night include:  * Parmesan cheese rib eye * Cheese infused prime ribs * Chimichurri steak * Corn bread  (This was so gooood! We were planning not to try it but I was like.. meh, why not. Glad I did. The bread was sweet and spongy!) * Fried bananas"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Copa Cabana since moving to Toronto a few months ago. Both experiences were almost identical. The service was the only low point of the night (not terrible, but not up to par) Very slow to refill drinks and clear plates, and tough to flag down. We had to keep asking other staff to send our server over.   They have a decent selection of salads and cold items at the buffet (I didn't try any of the hot buffet items) and the breads they have are fantastic. There was a cranberry orange loaf that was still warm, and so delicious. I could've easily filled up on that.   The servers bring around freshly made corn bread, fried bananas and fries to the tables. The bananas have WAY too much sugar for my taste, but I love the corn bread.   The main event, of course, is that they bring around a wonderful selection of spit-roasted meats to slice at the tables. They can be a bit salty for some (perfect for me) but the quality is fantastic. Probably the best chicken I've ever had in a restaurant (you could just cut it with your fork!) and the other meats are so tender and flavourful.   The highlight of the evening, though, is the entertainment; beautiful Brazilian dancers / performers and fantastic music. It's very loud but such a great vibe! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will definitely return."}
{"text":"We were here for my friend's birthday. It was a free meal for him.   At this Brazilian All-You-Can-Eat steakhouse, the servers come to you with a variety of meat options on rotisserie-style swords. Fast service. The top sirloin and filet mignon were good. I recommend the grilled pineapple as well. Many side dishes to choose from including, fish, mac/cheese, potatoes, pasta and salad.  The servers were physically fit aka dudes with big arms. They had live music. It was a great experience.  Tip: Make reservations! It gets really busy."}
{"text":"Meet the meat eater paradise. It was delicious, filling and with a good variety of meats + the pineapple and bananas that were awesome. I wish the meat was more to the medium side and less leaning toward the rare, and had less salt added to it, but there was plenty to look forward to. What I liked the most is service. The servers were polite, calm, friendly and the atmosphere was very cozy. I will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I called and booked our reservation to celebrate our anniversary.  When we arrived it was not in the system.  The host informed me that I was suppose to get a return call.  I was unaware of this.  I should have gotten a call to say they were fully booked for that day.  I did not.  Instead of being accommodating, she was very rude.  She said there is nothing she could do for us.  I asked what about if there is a no show? She said we could wait if we want.  I wanted to wait, but my boyfriend didn't.  After an hour I decided to walk over to the bar.  I asked the ladies why they have the bar set up for dining?  They said it was for overflow, and we can sit there if we would like.  We were so grateful and confused at the same time.  Why didn't the host offer us this option.  Nobody was sitting there.  Soon people came over and asked us permission to sit near us.  We ordered our drinks and we were quite happy with our seating.  We believe it's the best in the house.  The night was going wonderfully, until this same hostess walked up to ask who seated us.  I said excuse me?  She asked did somebody seat you?  I answered yes.  She asked who.  I said I didn't know her name.  She said was she a hostess.  I have no idea what her position is sorry.  Then she walked away clearly upset and she upset us as well.  She obviously wanted to speak too or reprimand the person who seated us.  We didn't want her to get in trouble plus she was making us another round of drinks.   The food was on point as usual.  All in all there was way too many positives.  It made up for that host."}
{"text":"Wish I can give a negative rating. We made a reservation. When we got there on the day of, our reservation wasn't in the system. They told us to wait 5 to 10 mins and turned into more than an hour. No one followed up with us. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This place has great food and service! Had a good time every time. I wished that I got a seat closer to the stage though"}
{"text":"Copa, Copacabana, the hottest spot north of Toronto!   AYCE, but the food is brought to you. From the moment I sat down I knew that this place was going to be alot of fun. When I sat down you had you're usual utensils, spoon, fork, knife, and tongs? There had to be an explanation to why there were tongs and there was, it was used to grab the meat. As well there is a sign that is placed on the table, on one side the sign says cool it down on the other it says fire it up. This lets the servers know whether or not to keep the food coming, I made sure that it was on the fire it up side all night long.   There are two parts to the AYCE, one is where you get the food yourself or the other is where the food comes to you. The section where you get you're food it had the usual apps like salad, soup and pasta salad. There was also hot food like spagetti, linguini and jambalaya. The spagetti and linguini weren't the greatest but its okay b/c I didnt expect to get great Italian food from a Brazillian restaurant. However the jambalaya was sweet, it had the right amount of spice, rice and meat. The 2nd part is where the food is brought to you. The servers come to you're table with meat on a stick and slice it with this huge sword, I always moved back a lil everytime they sliced meat just b/c that sword could easily slice me up. I really enjoyed all the meat that they had to offer, the only ones that I wasn't a fan of was the the lamb and the chicken. The way the lamb was marinated turned me off it just didn't taste right, as for the chicken it was good but I definetly have had better.   During you're dinner if you're lucky you will get to see some entertainment in the form of music and dance. The music and dancing was very good, it kinda reminded me of being on vacation, which was a nice change during the winter season. The ladies that performed were shaking their hips while the men were doing the capoeira. It was a nice break from all the food.   Overall great experience, service, and food. As a fair warning, make sure you book well ahead of time if you're going for dinner. Make sure every member of you're party is there b/c the moment one person starts to eat the two hour time limit begins.  Items to definetly get  -jambalaya -garlic steak -grilled salmon -prime rib with cheese -pineapple -deep fried banana"}
{"text":"To wrap my review up in one word: confusing.   My Brazilian good experience ..  Side/salad bar is super generic. Think: hummus and fresh bread; rice, macaroni salad, AKA cheap carb fillers.  One step up from The Mandarin.    Meat freshly cut off at the table.  Tonight I saw: pork, prime rib with cheese stuffed, sirloin, mild sausages; chicken Parmesan, chicken legs ... I'm sure there was more. I lost count of the neverending options (and no, I'm not kidding). I didn't find any of it mind blowing, and the majority of what I tasted was tough, although not over cooked.   Service was super attentive. Servers left always topped up bottles of water on the table with no request (or approval); Charge for said bottled water appeared on bill. *i will note the bottle was obviously just refilled. There were air bubbles in it indicating the lack of air seal. Not fooling me.  The live entertainment consisted of 5 girls in little outfits moving their arms and their legs in no real sequence. The dancers looked bored, and the routine looked made up on the spot. I've seen way better drag shows.  The silk acrobat chick sealed the deal of WTF.   None of it was \"Brazilian' unless you count the girls little bikini outfits. I guess?  The washrooms on the top floor are amazing. Ladies: go check it out. The lighting is unreal.   Down-downstairs there's a bar. Sort of. It's also a lounge. And a sushi bar?  Confused? Yeah so were we when we couldn't get drinks from the one bartender who moving at a snails pace .... The music was super lame and slow. The party I was with (14 of us) stayed for a couple of drinks (which took over an hour to receive!) and headed to another bar up the street who could serve us quicker.   This restaurant is a corporate 'office party' place; eat, small talk and then get the hell out."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!  Not worth the FOOD POISONING however.  Went there during the holidays with 10 people.  5 of us became very ill the following days.  I was hugging the toilet at both ends for 3 days.  Even missed a day of work cause of it.  Notified Toronto Public Health and they did a full inspection...  Twice apparently... (Since the same happened to another party 2 weeks later).  Spoke with the manager and he didn't really give a crap.  I love Brazilian BBQ.  Had it a bunch during my travels to South America.  The food was great here... Service was fast and efficient.  It's very disappointing that it had to end in a such terrible way for 5 out of 10 of us. :/   Also, $1 for water??? What is that shit?"}
{"text":"I had a great time here with my husband for my birthday dinner. We both really enjoyed our food. The meats were very tender, not overly salty, and came often. The men serving the meat were very nice and the waitresses were very nice and attentive.  Our table was a bit off balance so I let my server know and she tried her best to fix it herself( she got on the floor in her dress to try to fix it for us) and then the manager happened to drop by and fix it for us! Great service. This is my favourite location I have been too. The only other location I have been to has been the Niagara Falls one, which is very good too."}
{"text":"This review is for the Adelaide location.   Interior is really classy! Overall good environment for large groups.  But it is really hot/stuffy.  4/5  Food was decent. 3/5 Servers carry the different meats around and cut you a piece at your table. I liked the top sirloin and bacon wrapped filet mignon the best. Chimichurri was okay too.  The garlic cube and flank steak were a bit overcooked/bland.   There is also a salad/cooked foods bar which I ate more of. I recommend: Spinach salad, mango salad, kale, broccoli, and mussels.   Service was disappointing.  2/5  1. Servers carrying the meats came really fast.. I guess that's how they operate but i would feel rushed at times.  2. Servers carrying meats rarely smile, are rude, and impatient. They didn't give instruction whether I should use my tongs or if they would serve it directly to the plate, so they would just stand there looking impatient.  3. My friend was busy talking and one rudely interrupted \"Excuse Me\" to ask if she wanted the meat.  4. While cutting the meat, the piece fell on the table but he didn't say anything, leaving my friend to reluctantly pick it up from the table. When she asked for another piece, he shaved off a tiny, thin piece and quickly left the table.  5. My friend asked for ribs and the server said she would check. When my other friend checked up on the order, she said \"I know, he already asked me\". We were then told it would take 15 mins to make, which ended up to be more like 30 mins. And when it arrived, it was not the same ribs he had earlier - this one tasted like brisket and had no bone; it was more like the inside of the meat without the crust. It was unevenly seasoned with some pieces no taste and others salty.   Entertainment: Brazillian dancers  Verdict: Decent buffet food for a unique experience, but poor service."}
{"text":"I feel like this is place is overrated.  The open food bar doesn't have many food options also they don't taste good. It's nice they have fresh cooked meat and they come out on a stick but some meats are too salty."}
{"text":"I come to Copacabana pretty much ever 1-2 weeks (might sound crazy to some). I have tried every location and this is definitely the location to be at. The meat is always consistent, service is always amazing and reservation was always ready on time. The manager at this location has become a friend of mine (Short, muscular, light skinned gentleman) and he is nothing but amazing. Always checks up on us, makes sure all is ok, and really knows how to run the place. Also Charlie!! He is always coming up to me asking myself and the rest of the table what we need, what were missing, and making sure we are enjoying our time! Both the manager and Charlie really know how to customize an experience and that is why I recommend Copacabana to all my family and friends that is why I am ALWAYS here. See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"I reserved a table of 4 weeks ago for Winterlicious at 7pm on January 31st, 2015.  Seeing as how the restaurant did not contact me to confirm my reservations, I tried calling yesterday afternoon just to make sure they still had my reservations.  There was no way of talking to someone.  Every option I pressed sent me to a voicemail.    While we were driving over we realized that we would be 10 minutes late due to several accidents on the 401 so I tried giving them a call again. This time someone picked up.  Right away I was told that they don't have reservations under my name and that they don't take reservations on the hour.  Only on the half hour.  The girl told me that I must have contacted their other location that takes reservations on the hour.  I informed her that I did indeed contact the Eglinton location since the Adelaide location wasn't taking reservations for Winterlicious.  She must have told me 3 times or so that I must have not spoken to them and that I had basically been mistaken about the time and location of the reservation I had made.  At this point I was getting irate.  I had 3 other hungry people in the car with me listening in and counting on these dinner reservations for a Saturday night.  The girl on the line said she would put me on hold and see what was going on.  And then she hung up.    At this point I figured it would be near impossible to get another dinner reservation elsewhere.  I tried a couple of places with no success.  So in a final act of desperation I called Copacabana back.  The same girl answered the phone.  She asked me to just hold the line while she spoke to someone to try and get us a table.  Once she came back to the phone, she said that unfortunately the only time she could get us in was at 9:30pm.  She finally told me after I pressed on about what happened with my original reservation, that she knows what probably happened but that she couldn't share that information with me.  Since me and my hungry 3 friends couldn't wait another 2 and half hours to eat dinner, I declined her offer for the 9:30 table.  We were lucky enough to find reservations for a restaurant called Gabriels in Mississauga and in the end we had a great evening.  All in all, I am very disappointed with the confusion around their reservations process.  The hostess implied several times that I was at fault for the reservations not being taken correctly.  And not enough was done to fix the error once they discovered they were at fault."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled meats as always, fun atmosphere as always, just as savory as the original restaurant in Niagara Falls.. Unfortunately if you are in a large party or have been seated for longer than 50 minutes, the service grinds to a slow -almost non-existent- halt. This happened in both Niagara Falls and Toronto, it was not a fluke occurrence, and my friends experienced the same.  I will be back for the food once in a while, on an indulgent and patient occasion, but I will not be making a reservation for the consistency in service. I think a big downside is the \"built-in\" service tip of 10% for parties 6+... which doesn't let you tip more OR less, and basically tells the servers to \"stop trying\" because they are going to get 10% no matter how hard (or not) they try.   Grill on, keep the bacon wrapped sirloin coming... But for Brazil's sake, don't leave the large tables hanging, like your meat-juice soaked skewers."}
{"text":"So I went to Copacabana Brazilian Steak House for the first time last night. When I went in with my coworkers we thought are these girls on the menu too?;) We spent the first few minutes ordering drink and debating whether or not our waitresses kahunas were real. We concluded they were not:)   Anyways back to the review. The down sides to the place was that the washroom needs a major renovation. I was expecting the washroom to look as nice as the dining room but no it was small with a pretty bad layout and things were broken in there.  The service was great in the beginning but as the night went on and it got busy the service started to decline, until the point we had to wait quite a while to pay for our bill.  Finally for the food. I have nothing, absolutely nothing bad to say about the food. It was AMAZING, DELICIOUS, ORGASMIC. I loved every meat dish that was there. The least favorite was the Parmesan Chicken and Beef. My favorite was a toss up between the Lamb Chop and the Cheese Infused Prime Rib. I also cannot forget about the Cinnamon and Sugar Glazed Pineapple. I think I had half a pinapple to myself.  It is a bit pricy but the meat is delectable and you cant compare it to other types of meat that you will find at an AYCE Buffet. I would definately go back. Infact I think I may go back next month."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, amazing service the patio was nice. The salad bar was amazing, mac and cheese was tasty that was OK.  However the MEAT was horribly salty, first few bites were tasty but more than that we wanted to die.  This is a scam that most all you can eat restaurants do so that you can fill up on water and that you leave early.  We saw people get seated after us and leave before us...hence my reasoning is true.  NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday on a weds night.  oh boy. It was GOOD. For $37 i ate ~14 different animal parts from at least 3 or 4 different organisms. Talk about VARIETY!   Why go to the keg and pay the same, if not more, when you can come here and get more cuts and better cooked meat!!???  I thought i'd be a harsh critic since I've been to brasil before (~8 years ago) but this place really blew me away. Comparing this place to many restaurants i visited in brasil, this place is the most LEGIT brazillian steakhouse experience. In fact as we were leaving, i had a short conversation with the owner in portugese (which consisted of mainly \"obrigado\" from my side).   When its not a random chinese guy who looks and sounds like me, but an actual brazilian running the place, thats how you know its authentic."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend out for a birthday dinner. It's a great place for a special celebration - the food, the entertainment, the location and the fact that it sways toward the upscale feel. To go there just for the heck of it might burn a hole in some pockets. But, even that said, the experience is well worth the cost you may incur.  The Good: the concept, look and feel, the meat (definitely not cheap meat)  The Bad: the cutlery; I was given a glass, broken on the edges that could've led to the unfortunate if I didn't notice it. My boyfriend's glass was uneven (don't even know how to explain that).  The God Awful: the salad bar / appetizer section; take my suggestion and fill up on the meats instead.  Pro tips (other than the subtle hints already provided above):   1. Call in beforehand to find out if they are going to have any nightly entertainment. Entertainment = bang for your buck; and unfortunately, they don't always have it.  2. Make reservations. If it's for a party of 2, do it though Yelp or Dinein.to or the OpenTable app.  3. Take a washroom break, you'll need it.  4. Don't bother flipping that card. The servers never notice it and come to your table anyway. So, learn to say NO. If you give in to temptation, you'll be full and unable to move in no time."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, I ate soooo much good meats here. Service was relatively good considering it was quite busy.   Me and my buddies came here for a birthday dinner there were about 18 of us. We all had drinks which was nice that they had a full bar!   Besides the all you can eat meat, they also had a all you can eat salad bar amongst other things to add to your experience here. Considering it was all you can meat, the pricing was moderate to what I expected it to be. Around $40 for the all you can eat.   There was also live music and dancers!!! My goodness they were pretty smokin!"}
{"text":"Copacabana is a one of a kind restaurant located in Toronto. I speak very highly of this place due to its overall impression and lasting it has left on me.  Coming in I wasn't exactly sure what they serve and nor did I know that it was a buffet restaurant. When I first went up, the bar was all salad and cold meat. I was not impress until men with swords came in and started serving us all the meat in the world. It was mouth watering.  The meat range from chicken lamb, chicken, steaks, and shrimps. And each one would have a different variation on how it was cooked. All were fresh and fresh off the oven. Let me tell you again it was mouth watering. It was so good that I forgot to take a picture of my own food. Each server would give you a tiny piece and unlimited of it. it wasn't overwhelming.  The servers were quick and polite and always brought what was requested. The ambience was great, beautiful servers and great music. I was very pleased. The cost was a little high but it was all worth it. I would so recommend this place to anybody who is a meat lover and they probably will see me again in the near future.  Also as a heads up to future visitors, they do charge a dollar for every water bottle given. I thought it was sneaky, but the water was also delicious so we paid the bill with no issues."}
{"text":"i'm confused about all the 4 and 5 star reviews... have you never eaten at a real steak restaurant before? the salad bar was good (lots of variety), the pineapple desert was good with the corn bread.  but the feature is supposed to be the steak. granted, there were lots of meat options. but i found all the meats (lamb, steak, chicken) were so heavily seasoned and salted. it really overpowered the taste of the meat. a truly delicious cut of steak only needs a tiny bit of salt and pepper.   considering the cost and the mediocre meat, i probably won't be coming again. one experience is more than enough."}
{"text":"If you're a meat lover, you'll def enjoy this place.  The servers come to your table with a specific meat and cut it in front of you.  The quality is pretty good.  They also have a buffet section in the back for additional Items such as veggies, salad, pasta.  Some of the meat they brought out were so repetitive, as a result, I had to ask the server when other meats were coming out and requesting for specific kinds."}
{"text":"After a hectic morning for what was probably THE best client presentation I've ever done, I had planned an entire team lunch to kind of let everyone know that they were doing great work and that it was all paying off.  We all decided that the new CopaCabana Brazilian Steakhouse might be a great place. They have a reasonably priced buffet menu at lunch, and it's a shit load of food, or so I had heard.  For $11.99 you get your choice of meat or fish (steak or salmon or chicken), and as much as you can eat in potatoes, salads, pasta, bread and more from the buffet.  The steak was \"eh\". On my first bite, it was the perfect amount of saltiness and cooked the way I asked for it--medium. But looking around the table we all noticed that the cooks had unevenly prepared everyone elses steaks, and a lot of them were not how we had ordered them. Wait staff was also a little cocky.  Those who had ordered the salmon found them undercooked. One co-worker ordered the Kobe beef burger, expecting something of a decent size. He ended up with something just a *little* bit larger than a slider. Disappointing.  I've heard a lot of good things about their original restaraunt location in Niagara Falls, but lunch yesterday was nothing impressive."}
{"text":"I am a condiment enthusiast but I found their succulently tender, no knife required, perfectly seasoned meat was so sublime I couldn't have imagined tainting it with any other kind of seasoning or topper as it was perfect as is! The staff was very attentive despite it being a busy Saturday night and we were one of three existing birthday parties. The Brazilian dancers and the musicians were amazing (even if scene with great shape they're in made you question how much you are eating in some vain wistfulness!) Yes it was crammed slightly but we were still seated and well taken care of. Best chicken parmesan and grilled pineapple I've had in my life. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So I just finished my meal around 1 hour ago and got back home. My belly is super duper happy. I've had Brazilian grilled meat before but I can tell the quality here is really good.   We were a party of 6 but 2 failed to show up but they were still very accommodating. The self serve buffet was actually not bad. I know some reviews said it wasn't hot but when I went (fri night) the food was very fresh and I saw the people cutting the cantaloupe. However the grilled meat is what blown me away. It kept coming and coming and it was hot. I was thinking that it would be cold or warm. But they made sure to keep bringing hot meat out.  Must eat the pineapple, the banana, and I forget which meat cause they had a huge selection but all the beef was really good.  The pineapple and banana was covered in cinnamon which was soooooo delicious. When they finished slicing the pineapple they would take it back in and sprinkle more cinnamon on top and reroast. This extra touch really made me enjoy my meal.  Oh there was also a show with dancing and singing! It was my friend's birthday and the atmosphere was top notch.  Only thing is it can be a bit loud so not the best to hold a serious conversation.  Over great good and atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"We were one of the first into the restaurant, a large group of about 15 on a Friday night. Food was hot, delicious and constant and service was great! Favourites included: garlic sirloin, signature steak, cornbread and of course the pineapple! Several times during the meal they checked to see if there was anything we wanted more of.  Live music was a nice treat.  We were reminded two hours after arriving that it was time to leave due to the time limit."}
{"text":"Happy birthday, mom! Hope you enjoyed your birthday present!  In one of my family's rare midtown trips, we decided to visit this place after hearing/seeing great reviews on it, and the fact we wanted to try steak from a place that's not American or Chinese. We didn't get the memo that there was free parking at the rear, so we ended up parking a block down in one of the paid garages.  The salad bar was, to be honest, nothing special. I would personally pass on it unless you really want your veggies. Besides, you're coming here for the meat, in which I was not disappointed. Despite the fact I went on a weekday, the meat variety is still quite decent, with flank steak, sirloin, turkey bacon, pork sausage, rib eye with cheese, filet mignon, Brazilian veal chop, and the last one I forgot but it had vinaigrette sauce. The standout ones were definitely the veal chop, rib eye with cheese, and pork sausage.  Aside from the meats, the restaurant also serves up some nice desserts including pineapple, corn and cheese bread, and baked puff. All of them tasted excellent, especially the pineapple.  Where this place loses a star would be because the bill took 10 minutes to come, even though our table was right next to the cash register. The manager eventually said it was a printer problem, but it was rather inconvenient since we paid our parking space for 90 minutes and were approaching the 90 minute limit.  Regardless, I'll come back for our next major occasion. This place is not as busy during weekday nights, so if you don't want to wait I suggest you come then."}
{"text":"The amount of meat paled in comparison to the price. The waiters were fast at coming over and skewers were laden with meat. But the experience didn't leave me satisfied or longing for more. The food was great, but at the end of the meal, the meat did not merit the price. My friends and I were shocked by how much each our bills came too, we didn't even order alcohol, the bill price dominated the car ride home. It was not worth it."}
{"text":"My work Christmas party was held at Copacabana on a Thursday night. It was packed in here with families, large groups, and other parties. From Sunday to Thursday, you can have unlimited M E A T and enjoy the salad bar for $40. The salad bar is self-serve and the meat comes around to tables on a skewer. I found the service to be excellent; staff came around often offering us a variety of meats along with fried bananas and cheese balls. The salad bar had A LOT of items to choose from, including pasta salads, pizza, sweet potato mash, rice, sauteed vegetables to name a few. I really enjoyed the ambiance - live music in a lounge setting was awesome.  Make sure to come here on an empty stomach. There is a lot of food - speaking to colleagues the day after, many were still stuffed from the night prior.   Good for: groups, parties"}
{"text":"Brilliant place, churrascaria. Restaurant is quite lovely and waiters, waitresses are quite good at their job. One thing was we sat down at a table and they said it can be used only for 2 hours. They didn't bother us when 2 hours was up. Other than this, food was orgasmic. They always bring fresh meat, very tender, each time with different seasoning and also have chicken and pork sausage too. Even chicken drumsticks were really tender. As much as you can eat is $38.95 / person, drinks and desert are extra. It's pricey but that food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"I come here often like I'm singlehandedly trying to put the servers and their future children through college.   Mainly go for the Picana and the Top Sirloin, I don't ever bother with the chicken options, lamb is decent but they damn well need to bust out some more of those ribs.   The Grilled pineapple is always on point, and so is that cornbread.   Why only 4 stars then? I had my staff Christmas Party here and they made us all wait for half an hour to get seated. I did mention to them that this was a Christmas party, and the area we eventually sat down in was empty for a good 15 minutes and well after the dinner rush.   THAT BEING SAID, you guys need to bring some of that eggbread from that downtown location up here."}
{"text":"For $50-60 a head after drinks, tips and all applicable taxes, I expect way better quality meat. This place is a huge ripoff, and the worst Brazilian steak house i have ever been to.  The cuts of meat are seasoned with all kinds of crap (why??). A good cut of steak should not need anything except some sea salt and pepper. They smother half the cuts with these steakhouse seasonings that ruin them. And their marinades are terrible. They even put cheese in a bunch of them (gross and completely unnecessary). clearly they are trying to mask the lousy quality of the meat they're serving you.  Stay away. Spend your $50 bucks on one good steak elsewhere."}
{"text":"I go to Copa Cabana 2 times a month with my boyfriend and have tried all the other locations, and I have got to say that I am so dissapointed. I was convinced to try this location as I heard good things about it, and Winterlicious is going on. I had made reservations for 8:30 and got there at about 7:30 pm. The hostesses took our name and reservation info and told us we would have to wait until 8:30 regardless, which is completely understandable. However, the hostess offered that if we were interested, there is an island area with high seats that was available. I immediately said yes we will take it, as we have never tried that before. She said okay we will clean it up for you have a seat. So we waited, and waited, for about 25 minutes, then she came back and asked about our reservation information again... We gave it to her and she told us there is no such reservation in the system... Not sure what happened but I told her maybe there is a mistake in the system, but we told you that we're okay with the hightop table so we don't really need to reservation anymore since you said you would seat us there. She said okay, 10 minutes passed and we were still not seated. From the time we walked in to this time, the table was ready for us and we had not been seated. So I approached the hostesses and said do we seat ourselves or how does it work? She said \"Oh you WANT the high table?\" ...I said yes I told you that twice , and it's been ready, and after this we were finally seated.  This wasn't the main issue. When we were approached by multiple men serving the meat, I had asked for well done (Which I do everytime I go to Copa Cabana no problems ever) and I was actually questioned by two servers. One told me \"How about medium well is that okay?\" and the other told me \"Oh you're not pregnant it doesn't matter don't worry\", which really dissapointed me. I had asked for well done, and I was paying 40$ to eat meat that was WELL DONE. One server questioned me and the other tried to bargain with me. I said it's okay and kept eating the appetizers. What really bothered me is that a group of guys came and sat beside us, they were evidently regular customers and we had offered to moved over to make space for them and add another chair. When they sat beside us, they told the SAME server I had, that they wanted it well done. He did not question them one bit. He said \"you got it! \" and brought out 3 different types of meat within 15 minutes and from each meat he gave them a large amount and it was clearly well done. At this point, I was very dissapointed as I had only received 3 different meats well done and very little portions of each within my 2 hours of being there.  Very dissapointed..."}
{"text":"I would recommend you go during opening as service can get slower during busy times probably because of lack of staff. Other than that food is excellent and servers are well trained and give very good service."}
{"text":"SO much meat....so little time. Overall enjoyable, some dishes did not thrill me but I would return again."}
{"text":"Our party arrived for 8pm for our reservation and we were told our table was not ready. We watched other parties that appeared to be of the same size as ours to be seated before us, when our party was ready at 8pm with a reservation. The hostesses at the front would just tell us to wait and they are figuring things out. We later find out the table assigned to us had started late and finished their meals late. This establishment should improve their time management process, and perhaps the hostesses should be more proactive in informing us of the reason for the delay, instead of having us approach them and inquire about why the wait is this long when we made a reservation and arrived on time. We were finally seated at 8:45. The food was delicious as usual, their food gets the 2-stars."}
{"text":"Meat, meat, meat! Sometimes you just want meat!  Well, I do anyway. And when I want that delicious meat, I go here. Not only do I get to eat a large variety of different meats, but they ALL taste delicious. Juicy, flavourful, melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  It is very important, although hard to remember sometimes, to leave a little bit of room for the cheese buns and a LARGE amount of room for the grilled pineapple. They come around a little later in the dinner and are just magnificent. If you are here on the weekends you will also get to try the fried banana's (also an important must-have) and see the live performances.  I always have a lot of fun here... ... and my meat needs always get satisfied."}
{"text":"There's too much at steak in this review so I have to make sure it's perfect. I hope it's not a rare opinion. I made a reservation here for my family and myself as a celebratory dinner for my graduation and I couldn't be more pleased with the way we were treated. They called ahead to confirm the table, and welcomed us very pleasantly as we walked through the door and had our table already prepared for us. Our server gave us a run-down of how the meal works - Buffet, then the meat is delivered to you, and then pineapple for dessert  The meal starts off with the buffet (it's a set menu) which is stacked with items to prep you for the meat that's about to come. The buffet has items ranging from fish fillet, Mac n Cheese to sweet potato noodles, mashed potatoes, garlic bread, and other vegetables.   My family generally likes their meat to be well done so all our meat was extremely tender and had a lot of juices flowing out of it. We were served around 10-12 different types of meat ranging from Chicken to beef to lamb (We don't eat pork). There was not a single delay in getting our food and the staff just kept bringing it out for us, which was great! The pineapple was a wonderful way to top off the whole meal!  The only qualms I have about this place is that they don't bother checking dietary restrictions or choose to ignore them and they don't try to accommodate you as well (The meat is NOT halal; 2 of our family chose not to eat the meat but the servers still would force them to try some; they brought pork to our table after we were explicitly told them not to)  Other than that, the staff were friendly, our host was sweet, the food was delicious and the ambience was through the roof! It was an absolutely amazing experience and I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a fancy dinner/date! PS Copa Cabana is free on your birthday!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! All you can eat high quality meat! Everything was so flavorful! I definitely ate to much..."}
{"text":"We were here for Summerlicious 2017. Besides a 10 minute delay in seating us, we had a great time.  Our Host(ess) Taylor was very sweet and informative. She asked if it was our first time and put us at ease. She kept coming by to look after us and make us feel comfortable and welcomed.  Our Brazilian Meat carver Mattheus and our Serbian Meat carver Dusan, were constantly replenishing our plates with more and more beef, chicken, bacon wrapped beef and salmon steaks.  The grilled pineapple was to die for and my friend also praised the fried banana dessert highly. For such a small amount of money we had 8-10 different kinds of meat. Also at the buffet were easily twenty more items. But we stayed with the carved meats and lots of chimichurri. Standouts were the parmesan encrusted beef steak, the garlic steak and the cheese infused steak.  This is by far the best Summerlicious 2017 deal so far. Grab it."}
{"text":"Great food and performance on a Friday night. Do try out the grilled pineapple - it's to kill for. A bit pricey, but hey, if you can eat for 3, then it's very reasonable"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best examples of a Brazilian  churrascaria (Barbecue house) serving meat \"rodizio\" style - that is, Passadores (\"meat waiters\") bring various cuts of meat out on giant skewers, which are then carved and served to you individually until you cry \"no more!\". It is a shrine to savoury, umami, & barbecue. And a heck of a lot of fun.   There's more, though! Your meal starts with a trip to their well-stocked salad bar, cold and hot buffet. The salads are quite good, and charcuterie items delicious. The hot items change regularly - for us tonight it was various forms of potato or rice, beef lasagna, a fish stew, and a bean dish.   Don't fill up there, though! The real star of the show is the barbecue - served to you when you flip over the chit at your table to \"blue\" - and they keep serving until you can't take anymore. :)  Also brought to the table are delicious warm, moist cornbread, deep-fried banana and Pão de Queijo - tapioca cheese bread puffs that are not to be missed!  The selection varies based on day of the week - from what I can tell, Fri-Sun is the full menu, while the remainder serve a slimmed down menu. Items not to miss: cheese-infused prime rib, garlic marinated ribeye, chimichurri steak, Parmesan crusted chicken, and their \"house steak\" - picanha, a top sirloin cap that is the star of the show.   At the end, you are served delicious BBQ pineapple dusted in cinnamon and sugar.  You will not be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my family during Winterlicious. I arrived 25 minutes early and they allowed me to sit down at our table. Our waitress was excellent. All our servers were great despite the place being PACKED, I never felt ignored. The food was amazing. I really enjoyed everything. I think I tried EVERYTHING too. The sauteed mushrooms, the mac and cheese, the beef lasagna, the salads, the corn bread, all were amazing!  The meat, obviously the star of the show just kept coming. Nothing was overcooked (I like my red meat bloody, so I was worried it wouldn't be to my liking... no such problem). I loved the parmesan beef, roast beef, and chicken. Everything was so good and the meat was extremely tender and tasty! For dessert they had deep fried bananas and pineapple. They were SO good. I wish they had some ice cream for the bananas. There was a band playing, coat racks at the front, Steigl was $5 and the Brazilian house beer was also $5. 100% would visit again. I think I'll need a year to recover from my food coma though. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Brazillian Steak. They cook the meat in a Kebab-like style with a huge skewer and then go in front of you and ask you to use the clamp to clamp onto a piece of the meat while they cut the meat with a saw. I have got to say, The meat is delicious, but the pineapple they cooked using the above method is also astounding. Only bad part about the experience is when the bill comes to you and you find out that its around $50 dollars per person. So if its a party with friends or a company dinner, this place is worth it, otherwise, wait for the winterlicious promotions, where it is slightly cheaper."}
{"text":"Fellow Canadians...let me say this. If you love meat. If you love grilled meat. If you love steak. Don't walk. Run to Copacabana. GO.  Upon arrival you are seated and the concept is explained. My sister and I sampled a few sides. It was the only time we visited the salad bar, pasta sides, hot and cold vegetable fare (DO try the lasagna. It's top notch).  We didn't bother returning to the \"sides section\". Because the gents came around with the steak and they kept it coming.  I'm a true steak connoisseur and prefer filets. But the skirt steak rub...a sweet seasoning while savory...I'm a convert.   Don't deny yourself the grilled pineapple after you've had your fill of delicious meat. There's a reason why Yelpers speak so highly of the grilled pineapple. It's a cinnamon crunchy crusted delight that's hot and definitely worthy of four stars. Next time I'll request a whole grilled pineapple. Yes. A whole one.   My sister and I visited on a Saturday night. The joint was hopping. Get there by 6 PM for tables under eight people. They don't take reservations for parties under 8. Add some great live music and Carnival-esque dancers and you've got a great evening out. Do it, fellow carnivores. Just do it."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to take friends and visitors to Toronto. The meats are always delish and the salad bar is extensive and always fresh. I love the filet mignon with bacon and chimichurri steak. Of course, cannot go without the pineapple and corn bread. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"OMG!!! This is our first time at this exciting restaurant. The food is so delicious. The waiters come around with a variety of meat on spits from steak, to chicken to BBQ Pineapple! The entertainment is superb!! A live band playing Brazilian music and beautiful Brazilian dancers! The music is very up beat and make you want to get up and dance. Waiters are very friendly. A great place to celebrate your birthday or any occasion. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.! Not only did no one clear up my dirty plates for over 10min but not one of the waitress wished me a happy birthday when I asked for the birthday desert. Honestly how rude and snobbish do you have to be to do that. Never again coming here again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday at 8:30 pm - been to the downtown location once and decided to try this location for my birthday dinner with my family.   Great atmosphere, but for those who had been to the downtown location this might be a little disappointing in comparison. A little crammed and only one floor versus the two floors in downtown. The dance performance was enjoyable, however again I prefer the one downtown one with the mini aerial acrobatic performance. We were served steak by 2 different servers throughout the night.   The steak here is delicious for those who are not sticklers about the cook on the steak. Some slices were medium-rare, most were medium, and a few would come well done depending on how thick the slices were. My two favourites were the parmesan filet mignon and salmon. Chimichurri skirt steak was my third favourite, but that's only because the cut of beef isn't my preference however the flavour was fantastic. For those who are sensitive to salt, you might find the parmesan-crusted one a little salty, so ask for a thicker cut to offset the saltiness.   The variety of the buffet was underwhelming and the same can be said about the variety of meats. There was much more variety in the downtown location including shrimp which they did not have at this Eglinton location. This location is also cheaper by $10 so that could be why.    Overall Copacabana is an amazing restaurant for meat lovers who value a multitude of steak flavours and aren't bothered by inconsistencies in steak doneness. The atmosphere and service is excellent. For the full experience I would highly suggest the downtown location over the Eglington one."}
{"text":"I'm a meat lover and I'd have to say WOW, you never leave here hungry that's for sure! But, you should probably do a movie night after you leave here.  Worth every penny!    I don't even bother with the salad bar.  So much food brought to your table its Fantastic."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with my guest from over seas. First I had to wait 45min for a seat then when I got the seat 15min passed by and no one served us. later on a new waiter came with other customers and told us that they made a mistake seating us and that we should wait at the front. Never again I'm going to this location. They have no respect for their customers."}
{"text":"The meat is unbelievable Go easy at the salad bar, you definitely want to save as much room as possible for the meat. The food is very well priced ($40 all you can eat) considering how much food you get (I didn't need a breakfast or lunch the next day) however, I wouldn't say the same about the alcohol. Try the grilled pineapple! Great entertainment! Call ahead of time to make a reservation.  The Yonge & Eglinton location can get very busy on the weekends.    Great experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I have been waiting to try this for a while now since my girlfriend told me about it!  Come into the restaurant with a live band playing right behind us! Think they sang happy birthday about five times.   They have a sword of meat that comes around and the servers cut off a piece for every customer! You use these personal tongs to grab the cut of meat from them and they move on. Your table has a card for them to know if you want more (fire it up) or no more (cool it down). That will gauge your serving time. They come around faster than you think! It was such a great experience. There's also an all you can eat salad bar which was filled with my favorite Greek food! Yum yum! Definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it.   Its about $37 a person. Not bad for ayce meat!"}
{"text":"Just an awesome place! I love the unique Brazilian Restaurant Concept (I don't know even one person who loves good meat and doesn't love the place), great for a any type of celebration! Highly recommended!  Tips: Their chicken is superb so don't get locked only on the steaks and ribs they bring you  I would probably marry their Grilled Cinnamon Pineapple if my wife wouldn't be with me last time we went there :)"}
{"text":"Oh My... my tummy is going to explode from all the tasty meat... I can't take it any more. Tell my parents I love them. I died doing what I loved, eating amazing different types of BBQ meat with interesting sides like cinnamon BBQ pineapple. So good... Ok, I'm dead now. *croak*"}
{"text":"While in Toronto I had the opportunity to try out this place. Summarizing my review into just a few words: Terrific dinner and a show.    There was certainly a whole lot of energy in the air; The dancing women and the meat cutting servers along with the music that pounded throughout at just the right volume. The buffet was awesome, though it was the quality of the meat that did it for me. Just a little notch up on the service and this place is at the five star mark. Both of my thumbs up here!"}
{"text":"Great food selection.  They come around with different meats, and fish.  Also occassionally coming around with different countries like fried banana grilled landfill, and cornbread, and cassava fries.  Entertainment was great. Very authentic.  Took my right back to my trip to brazil during the carneval. Dudes killed it to with the capoeira.  You're lookin at paying $50 minimum before meat and drinks, but its good for a special night out."}
{"text":"So disappointed that they called me, demanding me to come half an hour early because they could not hold my reservation for 8:30pm for 2 ppl which it doesn't really make any sense because they made 8:30 pm time available when i made the reservation online. I'm so mad, knowing that i made my reservation days before so that i can take my boyfriend for a nice dinner for his bday and this happens  I'll never go to this location again! I didn't even bother to call and cancel."}
{"text":"Usually has good service but this time we were sitting the patio. Our waiter came to our table twice. Waited half an hour for utensils. Guess they were short staffed"}
{"text":"My bf and I went here a couple weeks ago for summerlicious, and I love the atmosphere in this place. They had a live singer while eating. Their appetizer table were full of delicious good, I suggest going around this time of the year because it is half price (pretty good deal to me). Their steaks were incredible. My bf and I had a hard time keeping up because we ate so much. They have a pretty good selection of meat and servers were very nice. We will definitely come back to this place in the near future!"}
{"text":"Walk in. Sluggishly waddle out.  This is a prime example of a 'get your money's worth' dining experience. The price isn't even that bad for all that you're offered; $37.99 (42.99 Fri & Sat) per person for live entertainment, unlimited harvest table, and all you can eat meat.  The harvest table has a good selection of salads, pastas, breads, and fish. Of course, what everyone is really there for is the meat. Delicious rodizio grilled meat.   The servers come to you with a slab of perfectly grilled and seasoned meat and slice off a piece for you, then another will come by with a different meat, then another and another and another. I'm feeling fuller just taking about it.  There's a nice variety of meats served. I especially liked the Parmesan Filet Mignon and loved the Garlic Steak Sirloin.  Another huge highlight is the roasted pineapple. I could eat that 'till I die which under the circumstances is possible when they keep bringing it.  Hell of a way to go, and totally worth it."}
{"text":"The good: For all you meat lovers out there, this is meat heaven. You can expect and if you want, to eat 100% of your meal to be fully meat. There's a buffet table at the back that has other sides, like veggies and bread. The service was okay, but there was one server who was really nice and asked us what we would like to be served. I asked for pineapples (they're delicious!) and he give me a lot! There was also a live band when we went on Sunday.   The bad: There might be repetitive meats that come around, and sometimes there's no meat at all. At the beginning, some of them didn't even acknowledge us to come to our table. The buffet table didn't look that appetizing but of course, people come for the meats. The price is a little steep (definitely a splurge), but a great place for special celebrations.   Tips: There is also copacabana by the sea and the receipt gives you 10% off to use it there, however, it's only valid for a week."}
{"text":"3.5 star for Copacabana.  Came here with a group of 10 for a birthday party on a Saturday night.   PROS:  - The meat! It really is delicious. Everything was cooked nicely, nothing dry and nearly all of it was extremely tasty.   - Entertainment was a lot of fun, I felt like I was on a resort in Cancun or something.  - Salad bar is reasonable, making it easy to balance your meal in case you actually want to have some starch or veggies.  CONS:  - Service - it took ages to get a first round of drinks and even longer to get a second and third round. I also wanted to try some of the cornbread and the guy never came around to my end of the table. It's also agonizing watching other tables being served meats that you want to try and then they run out before getting to your table.  - Seating - large tables in the center of the restaurant are all crammed together, so you constantly have people weaving their way in between tables. Too much traffic.  - Price was a bit steep. Dinner for 2 people plus 3 glasses of wine came to $180 with tax and tip. Would gladly spend $180 on a meal elsewhere with more relaxed environment, although some people love the hustle and bustle of this place."}
{"text":"This would have been 2 stars if not for the one server who had fully tried to take care of us towards the end of our meal. Although we came in with a big group, I had much higher expectations of the service here.  On first impression you're greeted with a dimly lit atmosphere with live music playing. For an all-you-can eat restaurant, copacabana gives off a much classier vibe. While I thoroughly enjoyed the live music, there were many breaks in between which was met with either silence or the restaurant's constant changing of songs in their background music playlist.   Next, we'll move on to the food. The appetizer bar is average quality and mostly bread and salads. Nothing really stands out except for maybe the basa. For those of us who are more carnivorous, you are met with a huge variety of different cuts of meat. However there are a select few that clearly outshine the rest. The parmesan filet mignon, top sirloin, picanha, and chimichurri steak were my favourites. Aside from that I was disappointed that some of the other options were far too salty, dry, and/or overcooked to well-done.  As for the service, it was very lacklustre. It took us several attempts to flag down a waitress for more drinks, and the wait time between different cuts of meat was ridiculously long. In addition, when they brought the meat, there was only enough to serve a third of our table. They kept saying they would be back with more, but it never came. Because of this some people didn't get served, and we ended up each eating different cuts. Thank god for the one server who asked us what we wanted, and made sure to bring us every cut we asked for.  Overall, the service here is what killed it for me. I like the different options, the music, and the concept. But I don't like to go to a restaurant to be neglected."}
{"text":"the company i used to work for until earlier this year had a christmas dinner and invited me to come along.  this is a pretty pricey place to eat but the food is delicious. the fact that i didn't have to pay for it made it that much better. cheese steak, prime rib, and bacon wrapped filet mignon were my favourite in regards to served meat. the cheese bread was also awesome. our table was pretty big. i heard from the other end of the table that they complained about the food coming out too slowly. but on our end i felt like the food came at the perfect pace. I didn't have meat sitting on my place for too long getting cold while i was finishing the other meat. it always came as i was finishing up something else. water refills came very frequently as well which is great. the grilled pineapple is AMAZING. i probably ate an entire pineapple by myself.  and thanks to the server that taught me the process in making it. I will have to try this at home at my next barbecue."}
{"text":"We visited Copacabana on a cold Winterlicious day and were not disappointed.   There was a huge line up, but we had reservations and so were quickly seated at our table. I pretty much completely ignored the salad bar an very much enjoyed the various meats. I am happy that for a Winterlicious they coped well with the volume of people and did not cheap out on their food."}
{"text":"So many options for steaks and meats! An array of tasty salads and nibbles to boot! Smaller tables tend to take longer to be served but they will bring out whatever you'd like, so if you want to go right to prime rib of lamb or fillet mignon simply ask! Lovely staff and cool to visit when the dancers or DJ are around. Fair warning, it gets busy fast so books a table in advance! Will go so many times I may become a VIP."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious with my family and we all had a great time. Our servers were very friendly and I was so impressed with one of the hostesses that went around to each table asking if they had any special requests and seeing her help clean and reset tables. This was our first time eating at copa cabana and we were really impressed with the selection of meats and the fact that it was sliced all in front of you.   I did not care much for the actual buffet part of the restaurant such as the mac n' cheese or lasagna. It was all very typical buffet food and I found that a lot of food in that section didn't seem fresh and were slightly cold. The guys who were going around cutting the meat were very talented but I found a lot of them to be rushing around. There were times when the guys would come around and ask if we wanted anything and I would personally say no and before my dad or mom could ask for a piece they already turned their back to us. I think it wouldve been nicer if the guys cutting the meat would be more sociable or create a connection with the guests. I know they are busy but getting to know your servers is part of the guest experience.  Other than that, the food was great and I had a great experience eating at this location. They had a great winterlicious deal and I would recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Copacabana for my granddaughter's 14th birthday.  The food was phenomenal - the buffet style side dishes were fresh,  authentic and delicious. A variety of beautiful salads, fresh breads and even lasagna and Mac & Cheese for the kids.  The star of the meal is definitely the variety of freshly roasted meats served table side - carved off the skewer.  The deserts were beautiful as well, all garnished with fresh, colourful fruits.  There was also live music with a Spanish flair   A must-try family restaurant suitable for all ages"}
{"text":"This place was such a let down!  I had high hopes for our dinner here (all you can eat meat - who wouldn't?) but while walking out of the restaurant after our party of 6 finished dinner, we all had the same sentiments...meh....waste of money...  Having never been to Copacabana before, we relied on the instruction of our server, who sent us to the salad buffet first, before any of the meat came. We brought our plates back to the table, and about 30 minutes after chowing down on salad the meat started to come. It almost seemed as if they were waiting for us to fill up on salads so we would be full by the time the meat came.   The meat then came in HORDES....all at once! - but this was short lived. The servers with skewers of meat were at our table one after another, with no time to eat the piece already on our plates. They also failed to describe the meat they had (super loud in there and when asked to repeat they just ignored - they need to have signs or something..). After we told a few of them to come back in a bit so we could tackle the meat already on our plates they completely ignored our table for the remainder of the night, even when summoned.   We also asked four different staff for more salmon (the one hit of the night + the grilled pineapple) and all said sure! no problem! ....and then it never came -____-'  The meat was super super salty and I have a feeling its intentional as they keep coming with bottles of water for the table - maybe hoping you will keep chugging and get filled up?  Basically the night was rushed, loud, poor service, salty meat, and with tax/tip/no drinks came to $45 per person (it was sumerlicious mind you, so it's probably even more expensive on normal days). For that price we could have gone to the Keg and had a great slab of steak with proper sides and better service.   Save your money.  Would I return? - No.  Parking? - Street parking on side street and on Yonge, Green P's around, Eglinton subway station right beside Value for $? - Not great Space? - Medium sized/limited waiting area (they will take your number and text you when the table is ready). Inside is pretty big.  Ventilation? - So so (aka you will smell a bit like food after) Service? - Poor"}
{"text":"There's quantity but no quality. Not one type of meat stood out.. For the price they charge, the quality of the food, ambiance of the place and service should be much, much better. One of the most expensive all you can eat restaurants for one of the least satisfying experience. Waste of $100!!!"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of this chain, All locations are unique and have something special to offer.. This original location gets very busy very fast, weekends or not, they're always packed..this might affect your experience if you're a smaller group, as they seat you with a limit of 1.5-2hours, in order to turn tables and seat the next group.  Prices are standard across the chain I believe, with $5-$10 less on weekdays vs weekends. They have live Brazilian samba dancers on weekends, which adds a lot of hype to the place.  Very accommodating staff, especially the general manager who was at this location, and he had moved to the Adelaide location when it first opened. For a specific reason on one of our visits, one of our guests could not have meat, only seafood, the GM simply created a whole grilled rodeo menu for seafood especially just for her, including shrimp, salmon, etc...which wasn't even on the menu for that day. This is a recipe' for success at any business, when your staff/management go above and beyond to accommodate your guests' requests.  Located closer to the intersection of Yonge and Eglinton, parking could be a real issue. However, parking space can be found on side-roads with a small hourly fee."}
{"text":"So I went to this AYCE Brazilian steakhouse with a 6-week-old baby on a Sunday night...big mistake. The live music was great (I knew all the songs) but it was way too loud for the baby. Even when the duo wasn't playing, the background music was too loud to carry any dinner conversation, not to mention that you'd be interrupted by people coming to your table to offer you more meat. Now, the food. Meat Meat and More Meat. There was a good selection of different cuts, though all were way too salty and most had parmesan on it. My favourites were the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, Brazilian picanha (rump cap), parmesan filet mignon and cinnamon roasted pineapple. There's also lamb and salmon if you're tired of eating beef. To balance out the protein, there is an extensive salad (super fresh salads, must try the kale salad and quinoa salad, dips (humus, guacamole), hot cheesy bread and hot foods bar (mac and cheese, lasagna, potatoe and sweet potato mash, rice, other hot sides). Servers also walk around with corn bread muffins and these cheese puff biscuits, both are must-haves! I would definitely go back (service was excellent, our server came to check on us over 6 times during out 1.5 hour stay, kept on changing our plates, asking if we wanted any food in particular, etc.). My strategy is to drink lots of fluids (water or beer) throughout the meal and pace yourself. So sit back, enjoy the meats, and let your ears enjoy the live music :)"}
{"text":"I struggled to pick between the 2 brazillian steak house offered in Toronto/GTA and I'm happy I chose to go with Copacabana!   What's different than other brazilian steak houses I've been to is that they don't give you a coaster to let the attendants know whether you want to take a break. The waitress service with the drinks is extremely slow tho. My boyfriend ordered his beer, and our waitress kept forgetting about it and didn't end up getting his drink until the end of his meal...and they still charged him for his flat beer.  Food on the other hand is spectacular. there's different kinds of meat coming around every 3-4 minutes or so. Be prepared to walk in with stretchy sweat/yoga pants cus you'll be wobbling out so full, you didn't even know your stomach can stretch that far out!  Meats is cooked to perfection. Even their sides don't lack in quality either.. Which is surprising cus novelty places like this where people go for the experience, food isn't normally good but Copacabana's steak is probably one of the best I've had in the GTA.  I would highly recommend you to go if you've never been to any Brazillian Steak House before.It's not an experience you want to miss!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I'm a meat lover and going to Copacabana is always a treat. But I know I always have to come with patience. The hostesses always have attitude. It always feels that they just want me to leave. One time they said the wait would be 2 hours, they got my phone # and said they would call when my table was ready. I was waiting outside for about 1 hour and saw a lot of people coming in an out. When I came in to check about my spot, they had removed me from the list. We asked to speak to the manager and he accommodated us to seat by the bar. Another thing is that they don't take reservations for 2 on Saturdays. I would come here a lot more often if the service was better or if it was easier to get a table. The servers are nice and experienced. The meat is delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, and great service ONCE you are actually seated. Otherwise good luck getting a seat.  Make sure you get there super early on week-ends especially, and expect to wait. Even with reservations it seems they aren't able to clear people out of the tables quick enough... So you'll find yourself standing there in a very small entrance/waiting area for quite some time.  Your best bet is to go to the bar, however it is quite small.  What this place needs to do is figure out a way to get people up and out of their seats quicker, or to not take reservations they can't keep.  Aside from that the pricing is not too bad... Although it's not one of those places you can hit every week. I'd say once and a while for fun."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that if you are going to Copacabana Brazilian steakhouse, just go to their Adelaide location. The service is faster with a larger selection for not much more.   Despite this, the meats were amazing and waiters friendly and charming. I went there for a birthday dinner and my friends and I were all impressed with the selection of meats and the professionalism of the people serving them. The Brazilian dance performance was captivating and a cherry on top of a fantastic night.   The only real issue I had - albeit a large issue - was with our server. No friendliness, negative attitude, simply barked \"do you want a drink\" rather than politely asking. She would go up to 40 minutes at a time without checking on our table, then come over with a reluctant attitude as if serving six people was a huge burden. If you hate your job that much, maybe you should quit. Took us forever to get our bills because this girl was so slow.   Despite the unenthusiastic server my birthday dinner was great, would definitely recommend Copacabana for the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to go with family and friends. I took my daughter here for her birthday and The food was amazing and the service was great. We will be back here soon.  Overall 100 % satisfied"}
{"text":"Took my mom here for her birthday. She loved it! We came Thursday for 7pm. They had a live band and a crazy Brazilian dancer! Got VERY busy. DELICIOUS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH STEAKS!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, servers come around with different types of meat on large skewers. The garlic steak was unbelievable. I thought the parmesan steak was too salty, however everything else was perfectly cooked, tender and just the right amount of red. We also tried the cheese bread and the corn bread, both piping hot. The roasted pineapple was delicious, with a hint of cinnamon and I think brown sugar. I would have liked a few more sweet options. Definitely recommend, although with a couple of drinks it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I have been here once for winterlicious and enjoyed my experience there.  I have also been to the Adelaide location a couple of times and that experience was amazing as well. My advice is to make the most of your experience. Focus on what you want to have and eat small pieces of  what you want from the salad bar. Once  the meat arrives at your table  eat as much as you can without overstuffing yourself. Make sure you try one of each  meat item that you want.   I felt the location was too crowded  and could use a few less tables so you do not end up bumping into others in the area As much as I love Copacabana I have been there four times And would like to explore other foodie destinations . Low chance I will be back but if i get the craving for AYCE or the fun of winning an eating compettion vs my friends I will be  there enjoying the  food :)"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed coming here for the great food and atmosphere.  For $37.99 Sun-Thurs, you can enjoy amazing meat cuts such as beef ribs, cheese prime ribs, grilled pineapple, bacon wrapped filet mignon and the list goes on! It is much pricier Fridays and Saturdays as they have weekend only meat cuts but sometimes those meat cuts sneak on the regular weekday menu as a bonus!  Once seated, servers come to your table with several meat cuts and with your mini tongs, you grab however much you can eat or just one piece at a time (don't worry, they do many rounds in case you missed or want to try a favorite again) There is also a buffet area on the side where you can help yourself to appetizers such as pasta, soups and salads.  A lot of people find the price intimidating but it is justified because thinking of places like The Keg, you're already paying around $25 for an 8oz steak and here, it's all you can eat!  Highly highly suggest it and they also have occasional live bands and flamingo dancers!"}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday. Amazing food! Tons of meat and chicken.  Super delicious, I ate until I was bloated and couldn't walk lol. Highly recommended.  There is also a Brazilian show.  Great ambiance"}
{"text":"We came here for winterlicious and the price is not that much cheaper compared to their regular price $38 and $40. They do have parking at the back which we did not know that was free of charge. It was nice but the salad bar was definitely lacking compared to the one downtown! The bread was cold and the butter was no where to be found.   The menu is the same, the usual assortment of meat but it did not have the shrimp which was a staple to the one downtown."}
{"text":"We went for summerlicious and it was actually better than I thought. Most of the meat were chicken and steak with different flavor..  I found the chicken was a bit salty even though they were not bad. The beef was pretty good except a bit too raw for me. The pineapple only came twice even we requested a few times. And they also didn't give much every time. The buffet table had some hot food such stir fry veggies, mushrooms, rice, mash potatoes, fish.  They had a live band and as we were sitting far from there, I didn't find them too noisy. I found the washroom was so tiny even I am a super slim person I could barely got in.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience. But I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Recommend it to all of my meat eat eater friends. The grilled pineapple has to be one of my favorites there. Make sure you come with a big appetite to get the most of your money. If you are planning on going on a Friday or Saturday without a reservation, do plan on waiting a fair amount of time before being seated."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!!! Great entertainment while we ate. Was a bit pricey but it was well worth it! We were lucky we made a reservation other wise we would be waiting a long time!"}
{"text":"5/5 honestly one of the best service restaurant experiences in Toronto. I went for my birthday with a group of friends and I was surprisingly shocked at how great our waiter was and I say this because we've always gone to Copa at Adelaide and I will never go there again after coming here.   1.  The service was exceptional. Our carver CJ was interesting, engaging and sincere. He deserves a star on his own. Our waiters at Adelaide barely acknowledged us and looked annoyed always.  2. Charlie the manager was attentive and hands on with his staff and the female hosts were professional and personable as well.  3. Food was amazing. Well worth your money and when at Adelaide we weren't even full because we had to wait so long for all the meat to come by but this location it was nonstop until you flip the Nao card. Quality is equally great.  4. Performance was good but Adelaide is better because they're better with 2 floors but I came for the food to be honest.   I would recommend any of my friends and family to come here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My \" go to \" place. Whenever I have a large group of people to take out I take them here. Great food and some entertainment.  A bit on the pricey side. (Dinner for 6 will run you about $300 - $400).  I would recommend this location even though I have heard that all the other locations around GTA are much fancier."}
{"text":"The ambiance. The energy and you can't forget the all you can eat meat that frequents your table. We have been several times and will absolutely return again.   The Parmesan infused meat along with what possibly is one of best assortment of BBQ in the city makes it a MUST. From chicken to lamb and of course prime rib you can top off your night with BBQ pineapple   Unbelievable selection and entertainment for the price."}
{"text":"At first, I was hesitant to come, as I went to a Brazilian steak house in Vancouver (Samba) and felt that it wasn't a good value, nor was the ambiance or food very good.  WELL I was shown very differently here!  I came with a birthday party of 15 people and we were treated extremely well even with all the commotion of an extremely packed saturday night!  Live sexy belly dancers that perform regularly and roam the restaurant, Capoeira dancers and a live band make the night lively and entertaining enough!  But the servers traveling around with the DELICIOUS cuts of meat were great :)  I ate so much I pretty much had the meat sweats afterwards.  There were over 10 different types of meats including (but not limited to) suckling pig, bacon wrapped filet mignon, beef and pork ribs, moroccan chicken, and then there was the toasted pineapple with a dusting of cinnamon to cleanse the palate.  Even the 'salad' bar was really great!  It was approximately $42 a head (it's only all you can eat, so if you don't want that, don't come here), so after tax and tip for a large group you're looking at $53 a person before drinks.  Not for the light wallet, but if you're looking to put yourself in a meat coma, this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite restaurant in Toronto. You have to try the roasted pineapple. Everything I had was good. Service is excellent, and the live entertainment is good too."}
{"text":"I love Brazilian grills in general, and I especially appreciate this location because they participated in the Seasonlicious festivals, which gave me an opportunity to dine here with a bit of a discount. Their prepared food is great, but their meat selection is wonderful - and cooked quite rare, which is how I like things. Some of it can be quite salty, but I'm not complaining. The drinks are also nice; I had a non-alcoholic passionfruit something here once - maybe a juice? - and I highly recommend it, though it was a little small. The service is always great, even during Seasonlicious, which I really appreciate - there are very, very few places that will treat you like a full-price-paying customer during those times of the year, and this is one of them. The entertainment is also nice - beautiful samba dancers put on a great show while you eat. I don't work in the area anymore so it's kind of out of the way, but I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone. I suspect the prices are also sliiightly lower than their beautiful downtown location, which is a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Always busy Friday and Saturday nights. We wanted to see the dancers but they were booked for weeks. The buffet doesn't have anything worth trying. The meats are all great. The cheese ball bread, which looked super exciting, was very bland and underwhelming. We don't plan on going again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place with my friends. We paid about $55 as we went in Sunday night. The place was filled with uplifting and exciting atmosphere brought by nice music and performances. It might be too loud for some people, but my friends and I enjoyed a lot.  The important thing, food, was just okay. Some of them were too salty, especially those with cheese. But overall, we enjoyed meat since we could eat in unlimited amount. Sometimes we couldn't get the meat that we wanted, so we asked the servers to bring them and they did in a few minutes, which was nice!   The service here is very good. The servers were very nice. Oh, except the one server that tried to make us go out as she figured that we were full then.  Go to this place when you want to eat meat a lot. But if you want to eat \"nice\" meat, then go to some other place and get the quality that matches what you paid for."}
{"text":"Great place, love the whole concept, love the service.   The staff is on point and the food is amazing. As a meat lover I was actually most surprised to find myself with consistent servings of perfectly cooked pineapple. They have a live band that I thought was great also, and that's coming from a person that dislikes live bands. Can't forget the awesome dancers too"}
{"text":"Great meat. Good service by the servers, not so much by the hostesses who act as if they are doing you a some kind of incredible favor seating you, especially when it's busy. They tend to quote ridiculous wait times, but you generally get seated within 15/20 minutes on Fri/Sat. The salad bar is very poor, almost does not look edible. The 3-4 times I have visited I just brought back an empty plate with a couple of slices of salami only. The dancers and fighters put on a good show. It's not that pricey given that it's all you can eat - multiple cuts / varieties of beef, pork, chicken and fish. The best cuts do come out more rarely as some reviewers have noted. In general, the place does not compare well against the US chains such as Fogo de Chao, Chima and Texas de Brazil, but since those are no better options in town, I am sure it will remain as busy as it is."}
{"text":"The entertainment was nice with the dancers and music. We went on a Friday.   The meat variety wasn't as great. We got 6 types of beef. 1 lamb. And 1 type of chicken.  The beef was excellent. I enjoyed the taste. It was medium or medium rare. Which I how I enjoy it.  One piece I got well done and I didn't enjoy that. But that was not the case mostly.  The waitress hardly came around. We had to get her attention to order drinks and when we wanted refills. She was pleasant though.  The servers were fine. They came and explained the meats and all.  We asked for the fried banana. Which they brought out. And even the corn bread. Both were yum. The corn bread was warm. Which was nice to eat at the end. The pineapple was delicious as well.  Atmosphere is fine. It was a bit loud for us with the music to chat. We were seated near the entertainment. But it wasn't a big issue.  And the servers did come around enough for us. Near the end they did come and ask if we wanted any specific type of meat that we already tasted. And the brought those.  Overall. Good experience. I love my meat. So I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"So I went there last week. It was good. The servers was roaming around making sure that everyone was fed well. The meats were cooked well. Although I have been to better steak houses, where there was more variety of the types of steaks and meats. I mean there wasn't any lamb, no pork, and just three types of steak were being offered. I would've thought there would've been more variety. But whatever they had was very well cooked. No doubt on that.  The waitresses should have been a little more on top of service. Had to ask three times for a wine glass.  Maybe I try some other steak house next time just to compare."}
{"text":"Have come a number of times, mostly for special occasions. The food is fantastic although the service is quite slow for some of the basics like beverages and if you haven't made friends with one of the guys serving the meats, you may be waiting a while. That said, it's a super cool place for an experience with excellent meat and I absolutely love the grilled pineapple!"}
{"text":"For 50 bucks a person, you can have any type of food you want and for four guys it sounded like a good idea to try their collection of meat.   We should have just left off the bat because they put us right in front of the band, it was so loud all night we couldn't have a conversation. I asked the hostess first if we could switch tables as soon as I figured this would be too loud.(5-10 min in) They said there is no way we can switch you to a table that you requested closer to the kitchen as we are fully booked tonight. The only options were to the side of the live music or outside on the patio.   There was a party of 20 people that left 15 minutes into our meal, which created a group of 5 tables of 4 when they left. I requested again as there was no lineup to their restaurant (it was a thursday afterall) and asked the waitress could we get one of the back tables as this table is too loud for us. She said no and that was the end of that.  I really guess it's bad luck for them that I haven't seen this group of friends in a long while and would actually like to have a conversation while we're eating. I also booked this two days ahead of time thinking I would be getting a decent seat instead of a seat in which I had to yell to the person beside me.  Easily said I won't be dining here again. I will leave one comment about the food, it's great the first few pieces of meat you get, but after that it all tastes the same. The guys with the meat are attentive and if you have requests they are pretty quick on it. For 50 bucks you can eat anything and guess what, I will literally eat anything else but come back here again."}
