{"text":"We ate with 2 friends at prego last night and had an excellent meal- have been at least 5 times in the past and always enjoy it.Angelo is an awesome chef and we are glad he is back in our neighbourhood. The restaurant has a nice quiet ambience and is a bit out of the way but well worth finding. Especially recommend the Caesar, seafood  and risotto.- dessert crepe was quite decadent too."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at Prego last weekend. The food was flavourful and the presentation was terrific. The service was much better than other Italian competitors nearby, we were given complimentary apps and the French onion soup was terrific. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews, but I'm so disappointed with the horrible customer service, this needs to be shared so that it doesn't happen to anyone else.

Two nights ago, I placed an order via orderit.ca to have food delivered to my condo. I chose Prego as my restaurant of choice. The menu looked great, so I was excited to receive my food. Since I placed the order at 5:57pm, I was told I would receive it from Prego (not orderit.ca since Prego uses their own drivers) no later than 6:57pm. 7:30 rolls around and I get a call from orderit.ca to let me know that my order would not be coming. 

Needless to say I was not happy. So I called Prego directly to see what happened and I was told by their Manager, \"Sorry, we are very busy tonight\". I told him that I placed the order before 6pm (before the dinner rush) and orderit.ca had even called to confirm with the restaurant and not only did they confirm they got the order, Prego waited 90 minutes to let me know I wasn't getting any food after I'd already paid them. 

The Manager's response: \"Sorry\" 

Everytime I spoke that's the only word I was greeted with: \"Sorry\". I couldn't believe the response so I asked to speak to the manager at which time he informed me he was the manager but he would let the chef know I was upset. Ya thanks for nothing. 

It's one thing to make a mistake, its another to miss an opportunity to fix a huge customer service error. Prego could've stepped up and tried to fix their mistake - they chose not to. 

*I have no issue with orderit.ca They were left scrambling and called and emailed to apologize the next day. Really, it's Prego to blame for poor customer service."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Have been twice already and took my sister in-law who is born and raised in Italy. When she approves of a meal I know it is a success! Wen they are busy be prepared to wait a little bit for your food, but when it comes it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Family went out on a Sunday night looking for good Italian and stumbled across Prego.  The other established restaurants on this stretch of the Queensway were closed on a Sunday, so Prego was our best (only...) option.  And it did not disappoint.  Simple Northern Italian decor, small dining room (12 tables?) and a view to the kitchen, where the Executive Chef featured on the sandwich board out front, could be seen plying his trade with two sous chefs at the ready.

The menu was balanced, with 4-5 grilled mains, but the pasta menu was a highlight.  Homemade bread crusted with oregano and chili pepper to start, we also enjoyed bruscetta (good, but heavy) before the entres.  Our table had penne vodka (done to perfection), one of the specials, a spinach angliolotti with Stilton cheese and pear (yum!), and I had the linguini with veal meatballs.  All were served piping hot and beautifully presented, after a bit a of a wait.  Food was truly outstanding from the freshness of the ingredients, al dente pasta, presentation and temperature at service. Gluten-free pasta options available for $2 more.

Service, though slow, was professional and genuine.  Penny was a charming hostess for our experience.

A few glitches that I am sure will get cleared up over time: the aforementioned wait time, the lighting settings changed 3-4 times during dinner, and I did not see (nor did I ask for) a wine list, so I cannot comment.

Overall, we will be back.  Either with the family, or for a romantic dinner for two.  Price for quality was definitely in-line."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I weren't sure where to go for dinner on Friday night and I'm always hesitant about Italian food because I always end up paying way too much for pasta. However, I'm glad we tried Prego because it did not disappoint!

We ordered the soup of the day, Caesar salad and a pasta dish each. The soup was amazing and so was the linguine with meatballs (what I ordered) and my boyfriend enjoyed the penne a la vodka. The salad was nothing memorable but still good. 

I couldn't believe how fairly priced everything was and the server was great! We'll be going back again for sure."}
