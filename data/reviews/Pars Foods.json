{"text":"The food tastes amazing, don't be fooled by the fa√ßade...the eatery is in the back of the store, but the kabobs and the rice were one of the best I've had in the whole GTA. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a Persian market/distributor. It features a broad array of Persian baked goods, some halal meats, a large selection of packaged and canned groceries, and a few cheeses. It is a large place and the bread is baked on the premises.

The bread alone makes this a 4 Star. In the morning it is tantalizing fresh, and has a great 'hot bread aroma'. When this is combined with the double cream bulgarian feta that they sell for less than about $ 6.00/lbs., and few olives you have the making of a great breakfast. 

On one of their promotions they gave away pergamot preserve. This is the fruit that is used to flavour Earl Grey Tea, and it is delicious. I have become a fan, and its great over plain yogurt or ice cream.

An interesting and varied place with fantastic Persian Bread."}
{"text":"Friendly lady - gave us free samples of baked stuff :) So yummyyyy. The round looking baklava texture is awesome. Store is attached to a bakery so everything is super fresh. They sell hot food at lunch hours too. Apparently they sell to many supermarkets because I saw flat bread here that I've seen at No Frills. Straight from the source!"}
