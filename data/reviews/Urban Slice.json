{"text":"This place is the worst pizza in Madison, bar none. It wouldn't even exist if it were not associated with Union South. The pizza has literally, no crust. It's like a runny piece of flatbread. They put an obscene amount of salt and cheese on their slices and the pizza is extremely greasy. I guess if you wanted a cheap hunk of salt and cheese, this wouldn't be a bad place to get it, but by no means does this count as pizza.  I would not recommend this place until they change their recipe."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day to get a pizza and I was quite saddened. The pizza was undercooked, had too much cheese, not enough sauce, and want warm. For 2.75 (or 5.25 for two) sure you'll get a filling meal, but it won't taste very good. There's definitely better pizza out there"}
{"text":"The pizza here is what we refer to endearingly as \"the greasy slice\". The flavor isn't bad, but I'd hate to see the list for the sodium content. The slices are the size of your head, so you get your calories worth for your money. Make sure to get extra napkins, the paper plate provided becomes saturated quite thoroughly. Overall for Campus food, it's typical- high calorie, average to low quality food for a fair price.  They do offer salads, and the price for those are pretty substantial."}
{"text":"The only thing good about their pizza slices is the price. The pizza includes way too much cheese for my tastes and is consequently far too greasy. Half the cheese would be a good starting point for me. The underlying crust supporting the toppings is usually anything but crusty. Next time I'll see if they can put the slice back in the pizza oven like some places do..."}
{"text":"If I fold over a slice of pizza it shouldn't break in half because the crust is too burnt. Even Papa John's understands this concept."}
{"text":"All I can say is that urban slice is pretty inconsistent. With students making the pizza you don't know what you're going to get half the time. Sometimes it's perfect, nice and crispy with the right amount of toppings. But other times it's either burnt black or undercooked and just a floppy greasy mess. For under 3 bucks for a huge slice I can't complain, but I'd take a look at the pizza on display before ordering"}
{"text":"There was literally no crust to this pizza. And by no crust, I don't mean \"thin crust.\" Essentially, it was a mass of cheese piled on a cluster of flaccid, greasy cardboard. On the plus side, the cheese and sauce were tasty enough. For $3, it's cheap enough to try, but the service is poor and highly variable. Come on Union South, step it up. Train your employees how to properly cook."}
