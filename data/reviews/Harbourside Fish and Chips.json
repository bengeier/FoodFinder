{"text":"Enjoy lunch $7.95 special. Great fish and chips. Change fries to onion ring, no extra charge.

Sitting area is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Just had the halibut dinner with coconut shrimp and deep fried oreos! Best fish and chips I've had by far! Beautiful decor and friendly staff too. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very good food!  Awesome fish and chips, fish tacos and I love the lunch special! I wish they had a sampler, like Heritage. When they first opened, I thought we were to order at the register and then sit. After ordering and taking a seat, I was very RUDELY told that's not the way it works. The woman was so grumpy!  I know better now but every time I see her, I remember how rude she was. I'm not sure she ever smiles!  If my family didn't love it so much, I would probably never go back because of her. She's the only reason I can't give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos and fish and chips. Clean and friendly, with a great wheelchair accessible bathroom."}
{"text":"I was craving fish and chips on my lunch break for work and found this perfect gem!

Service is friendly, excellent, and quick. 

Menu has a variety of options. 

Food tasted excellent. Large portions. I ordered the lunch special for $7.95 + tax, and substituted the chips for homemade onion rings. Both fish and onion rings were crispy and fluffy! 

Interior is refreshing, clean, and modern. I was almost a bit surprised since most fish and chip restaurants have a more run down look. All tables have salt, pepper, napkins, ketchup, and plenty of tartar sauce. 

I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips here is outstanding! Stopped by and had their lunch special-1 piece haddock and chips. The fish was perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and not greasy, the fries were amazing as well. The portion size was generous and completely satisfying. Our server was polite and attentive. If you have a craving for fish and chips, look no further, this is the place."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend about an hour before closing on a Wednesday. The staff was quite friendly and informative. The diningroom is very nicely decorated and clean so it's a good place to eat in. The food itself was delicious! The quality of the fish was nice and not overly greasy. I liked their takeout station were you can grab as much of anything as you'd like. I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"Really good fish and chips. Great prices. Definitely worth it. Great service. Will come back."}
{"text":"Okay. Stop what you're doing and get to this place. 
Fridays we eat fish and so are always looking for great fish and chips shops. Hands down this was the best I've had in ages. 
Both my husband and i had the halibut and chips with sides of gravy and curry. Not too greasy, perfect sized portions. Moderate price.
The menu was extensive with more than just the usual suspects....you could have baked fish with salads, and they have all sorts of fun things on there.
   The place was packed but our server quick, cheerful and the vibe was relaxed and happy. 
This will be our new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time here today. I must say I never expected what I found inside from just seeing it on the outside. It's a lot bigger than I had imagined. I got in at lunch time and the place was packed. Clearly, this place draws a crowd, so the food must be amazing!
So...I had to try that out and had their daily lunch special Fish and Chips. Trying to be a little healthier these days, I asked to have the hips substituted with undressed salad. And did they put together a nice salad!! The fish and it's batter tasted amazing!! Sadly, my mistake, I ate my food too fast before taking a picture, but believe me, the presentation was just as awesome as the service and the flavors of the lunch I had. 
I will be back for sure and will recommend this place to others!! Well done folks."}
{"text":"After reading so many amazing reviews we decided to check it out. We wanted to go here for almost a year and Mother's Day was the perfect excuse to have a relaxing and low key meal. 

Decor: the decor is nice and clean. Bathrooms are clean. Place smells nice and overall the decor is pleasing.  Tables were clean. 

Service: 4 stars. Very good service. I called ahead and they set up the tables for us to accommodate our larger group. Nice touch. We felt very welcomed when we arrived 

Appetizers: we ordered calamari, scallops, mozzarella sticks, shrimp and the waitress brought us onion rings on the house (nice touch). Calamari were so so. Scallops and shrimp were really good. Mozzarella sticks were fantastic. Onion rings were really good too. Everything was a bit oily. 

Mains: we ordered Alaskan Halibut and fries. The fries were mushy and not that great. The halibut was way too rubbery. The grilled halibut was also rubbery. 

Chicken Caesar salad was okay. Salad was fresh chopped. 

Chicken pot pie was pretty decent. My daughter loved it. 

The fries were the biggest disappointment. They were brown and soggy. Nasty. They really need to have fresh cut fries. And they were small fries too. So strange for this kind of place. 

The service was decent. Our waitress was super pleasant and extremely friendly. 

It isn't expensive overall. We were a large group of 11 adults and the bull was 250 taxes in plus tip. Very reasonable. 

Only wish the quality was better

Will not repeat."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the mall on the corner of Sandalwood and Kennedy near the Metro. We came here on a Good Friday when the wait is usually pretty long. They have a great system where the line goes to a couple cashiers who process take out orders and give you a number or take your name if you are dining in.

The wait was about 9 minutes which was a lot better than any of the Heritage locations. The staff was super nice.

Most of us had the Halibut & Chips and they were awesome! All pieces of fish were the same size too. Each table has its own malt vinegar, home made or pre-packaged tartar sauce.

This is now our go to fish & chips place!"}
{"text":"The small fish and chips shop opened recently, and I have to say I am blown away!
1) AMAZING FOOD - I had the halibut and chips and it was super delicious. The fish was very fresh and not greasy, the tartar sauce was addicting, and the fries were good (though could have been a little less greasy).
2) BEAUTIFUL DECOR - The decor is beautiful! It feels like you're sitting in a ship by the sea side (I guess that's where the name comes from lol)
3) FRIENDLY STAFF - The staff were super friendly and helpful.

I'll definitely be back... and I'll need to try the deserts! lol"}
{"text":"Not as good as others have said...least not to me. I found the haddock a little greasy for my taste. The coleslaw was clearly house made & tasty. The size of the fries was a full plate. It didn't make up for the undercooking however. This place needs to get better at the FRENCH fry making to stay in business long term I think. 

The house made onion rings was huge & worth spending the money & the service was very good. I'd go back again but I'd ask for different fries!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite fish & chips spot in Brampton. The decor is nice, the waitress was friendly, and the food is always fresh and never disappoints the countless times I have been there. You definitely cannot go wrong with the lunch  special (haddock & chips) with a side of gravy. The batter on the fish is the perfect amount, just enough to give the fish a nice crunch without it being incased in an oily thick batter like some other places I've been to. I hope this place sticks around for a long time and becomes one of those staples in Brampton."}
