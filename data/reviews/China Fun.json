{"text":"If you live greater than 5 miles from here, strongly recommend not ordering delivery, as it will likely take quite some time to arrive. The food was good, however there were large items missing from my order."}
{"text":"I tried this place against my better judgment and got what I expected. I ordered a sesame chicken combo. As usual with Chinese restaurants here, there was only little bits of chicken covered in lots of batter. Where's the meat? The fried rice was bland and lacked a main ingredients, egg. The egg roll was way overcooked, almost burnt.  

Where's the authentic Chinese food in Charlotte??"}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese takeout. Portion size is nice and I love going here on those nights I don't feel like cooking or don't know what to cook. Can never go wrong!"}
{"text":"A bit better than average.  Some things are your typical \"frozen bag\" Chinese food, but they have some really good Cantonese and Seafood dishes.  Their Singapore Mai Fun is really good as well.  Delivery is always fast and friendly.   Their General TSO is not my favorite- pretty bland and overcooked.  So just depends on what you get.  If you live nearby and do delivery, this place is great!  If you're passing through, there are better restaurants worth the drive down the street."}
{"text":"My order is almost always perfect! Delivery has always been fast, hot and with kind people. So far, my favorite fast chinese in Charlotte. Knock on wood but I haven't had a bad meal yet!"}
{"text":"Okay.... Wasn't that bad, but wasn't that good. 

Service was pretty solid, pretty quick, price was normal of what you would find at any Chinese place. If only the food was as good as some others."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for sesame chicken, but I've definitely had better. I ordered the lunch portion of the sesame chicken with fried rice and a order of teriyaki chicken. The teriyaki chicken was good, it wasn't to dry or over cooked, although it was a tad bit greasy. Now the sesame chicken on the other hand was horrible, the chicken was drenched in so much sauce that I could barely taste the chicken. In addition the sauce was so sweet that it overpowered the flavor of the entire meal. Finally the rice, it was flavorless and greasy. I had to add duck sauce to the rice just so I would be able to taste something on the rice."}
{"text":"We came across this place tonight when looking for an alternative to another place that's not so good. We were delightfully surprised and I'm glad I didn't look up Yelp reviews first because I wouldn't have tried them based on them alone. I can't speak for everything but we ordered the following and my comments about them are below:

1. Crab Rangoon - well cooked, just enough cheese and not over fried or extremely greasy (or over stuffed like some places). The only complaint was that they were somewhat cold when they arrived but that could be due to traffic as it was raining and I live near a very busy cross street that delays all deliveries. 

2. House Fried Rice (Chicken, Pork, Shrimp) - this was EXCELLENT! Healthy portions of meat and the rice is real fried rice and not some yellow rice mix someone is trying to make taste like fried rice. 

3. House Lo Mein (Chicken, Beef, Shrimp) - this was also EXCELLENT! Again, healthy portions of shrimp, beef and chicken. The noodles were cooked well and not extra greasy. 

4. Shrimp & Broccoli w/ Fried Rice - another delicious dish with healthy portions of shrimp (not bite size shrimp nice medium/large shrimp). Nice portion of fried rice on the side. 

All the food was well seasoned and still still hot enough to eat when it arrived. I thought the prices were reasonable for what we received and I'd certainly order here again (especially over the other place nearby!)."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Hawaii, I have had the pleasure of having great authentic Asian food. Of course the mainland is often a hit and miss and I have toned down my expectations. My husband and I thought this would be a great place to try. I love the name, one cannot help but smile when saying it \"CHINA FUN!\". 

I placed the order via phone so that it would be hot and ready when I arrived. Decided on the pepper steak, crispy won tun, and sesame chicken. Each meal was accompanied by fried rice and an egg roll. When I entered, I noticed that it was a rather small restaurant and unremarkable in appearance. I walked up to the cash register to where a woman was standing. I did not receive any greeting at all, not even a smile. I advised that I placed a phone order for steak and chicken. The food was brought out promptly. Still not one word from her. I yielded my credit card, she swiped it and returned it with a receipt for me to sign. Still not a word. As I picked up my food, I decided to give a cheerful \"thank you\" and received a mumbled \"you're welcome\" in return. Ok, not a deal breaker, but we all know service can go a long way. 

Got home and quickly served up some Chinese goodness or so I thought. Although the food was hot, the won tuns were not so crispy, the egg rolls were chewy and fried rice was standard. The chicken probably was the best out of our food fare. Apparently, their version of pepper steak is adding a TON of green peppers and onions with some steak (meat pieces). And you cannot go wrong with fortune cookies.

Overall, the food is a 2, service a 1 and location a 3. The best thing about this place is the name, in my opinion, I still love saying it...... CHINA FUN!"}
{"text":"The tea had gone bad and had things floating in it. The food was not very good.  The cashews in the cashew chicken was old.  The mushrooms in my Moo Goo Go Pan treated old.   First time there will be my last time there."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, decent prices, friendly staff and lightning fast delivery! Glad they are right around the corner.
Not much of a dine in place but they do have a few tables for eating in. Def recommendation."}
{"text":"Quick recap: clean fast and efficient Chinese. Large portions and reasonable prices. They deliver so that's a huge plus. Steamed dumplings were surprisingly amazing. 

First time I came here I got a dinner combo with fried rice and egg roll. So did my friend. Turned out one dinner combo could have fed us both. That being said, leftover Chinese is always a good problem to have. 

General tso chicken is pretty damn good. Egg roll was spot on, as was the fried rice. I also got steamed dumplings and they hit the spot. No regrets. 

I think what sets this place apart from other Chinese places are the oils that are used to cook. Not sure what or how but it tastes a bit fresher overall. I plan on coming back again for fast, price friendly Chinese."}
{"text":"Easy ordering, good delivery time, friendly delivery man, and decent prices! All very good signs for a first-time customer!

I ordered the fried dumplings and vegetable chow mei fun.

Oh. My. God. Those dumplings were the best I've ever had. It's so hard to find good dumplings and these were so delicious!

And the Vegetable Chow Mei Fun was very good, especially with the leftover dumpling sauce added to the mix.

Very light, very tasty!

Will DEFINITELY order again!"}
{"text":"The food always tastes fresh, they are so generous with their portions. Reasonable prices. It's very hard to find good tasting Chinese food here in Charlotte, but I am so happy I found China fun, they never disappoint. I always order to go, I never see people dine in."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times since they opened and have been very pleased with my food and service every time! 

The restaurant is located for in the shopping center next to the gas station and Pizza Hut. The good news is that there's plenty of parking and booths inside if you're dining in. And even better news is that they take online orders! So if your looking for hassle free easy ordering this is your place! 

The menu is pretty standard but I haven't had a dish I didn't like everything from the egg drop soup to the garlic chicken and shrimp and broccoli are always hot and full of flavor! And they don't skimp on the portions either! Whether it's lunch or dinner you'll have enough for at least two meals! 

Overall, super glad they are in my hood and I look forward to returning again and again."}
{"text":"Their food is always freshly cooked at the time you ordered. It's NY style Chinese, I always order here. Very good!"}
{"text":"We moved here in January and have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant. Ordered delivery from here for the first time tonight and we were very pleased. The staff was very pleasant and the food was good. They called to make sure the order was a true order since it was a large order (family of 5) and they were very polite on the phone with my husband and the delivery boy was very friendly and they also gave us 2 free things of pop! My kids were very happy with the food they ordered and so was my husband and myself. I think we found our go to Chinese place!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be ok for a typical fast food chinese place. Now its flat out horrible/scary.

The folks working there now are downright rude. 

OK, being very close to me I can handle rude as long as the food is good and safe to eat.

Oh my, the health dept really should do some surprise inspections on this place and shut them down.

Very hard to tell if the chicken was actually chicken. If it was, it was the most horrid chicken i've ever seen/tasted.

The shrimp was horrible...slimy and foul tasting...I know very old shrimp when I see it/taste it. So bad, I tossed it after a few bites. Yet those 2 bites made me spend the next 2 days living in my bathroom.

The ice tea dispenser is never cleaned. Pour that ice tea in to a clear glass and take a look (not if your squeamish however, as it will turn your stomach after looking at it...)

Ditto on the drink dispenser. Never cleaned and has moldy/mildewy junk in the lines.

The real kicker...What the heck are they doing with cans of dog and cat food? Im not talking about unopened cans that may be sitting there for them to bring home for their dogs and cats. Im talking about seeing open cans and seeing them open them as they peek around to see if anybody can see what they are doing.

Yes, I am well aware that there are of fast food chinese places with 'rumors' of them using dog and cat food and meats that are not what they are claimed to be. This is not a rumor. I saw this with my own eyes.

You couldn't pay me to eat at this place ever again. Frankly, I love chinese food, but I am going to avoid any and all chinese food for awhile. Not because they all do it (I suspect some do, some dont)....I am just so turned off/disgusted, it will be awhile before I can eat chinese again.....

When I do, I can guarantee, it will not be from this place. 

They really need to shut this place down, imo....."}
{"text":"I love the food from there. I'm not a Chinese food person but there food taste good and better then other places. I enjoy eating there."}
{"text":"Now I love some fast food Chinese food, especially if its near my house, but this place is just mediocre.

I've ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken from there over the past 2 years and I'm not pleased.  I admit to being a stickler for good rice.  Their rice tastes kinda greasy (even for fast food Chinese standards) and not well flavored. The chicken dumplings (nuggets? pieces?) were lightly fried and therefore still soggy.  The sweet and sour sauce was kind of watered down.  

Still, its a $6 dollar lunch with portions that would horrify French people who think we're all gluttons.  The staff are pretty nice, rushed nonetheless to pack up half-pounder lunches and dinners for us hasty folks."}
{"text":"I have yet to find great Chinese food here though. Especially hot and sour soup - I always have to Doctor it up. I'm a bit of a Chinese food snob too as I worked in a restaurant for 4 years. 

This wasn't bad though for a cheap, quick meal and their delivery was fast. 

Wouldn't get the hot and sour soup again - still on the hunt for it on this side of town. 

All in all an okay first visit."}
{"text":"Just moved to a new side of town, so naturally we had to find a new go-to Chinese place. And I think we have. 

Our first visit we ordered some veggie fried rice, crab Rangoon, and egg rolls; which were all great! I've had crab rangoon from a lot of places but these were probably the best; they were crispy, and fried perfectly. 

This visit we added egg drop soup and the Chinese donuts to the order (pictured) and they were AMAZING!

Can't wait to try out more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered from China Fun for the first time today. Never again.

Hot and Sour soup was horrid. not sure how it's possible to make a soup with no taste at all, but they did it. the soup had meat, mushrooms and a few other things but no flavor at all.

Pan fried dumplings weren't even dumplings. they looked just like the potstickers you can get from Costco.  They were actually good though, as was the ginger dipping sauce that came with them.

I specially ordered from China Fun because I wanted spicy chicken curry. I ordered it to be extra spicy. What I received though was curry without a hint of spice. Ok flavor, but not impressive at all.

General tso combo meal fried rice was bland and dry. Chicken sauce wasn't a sweet and spicy sauce. No spice here either. 

Bypass this place if you are looking for flavorful spicy food."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Chinese place in Charlotte. I ordered shrimp lo mein with no flavor what so ever, and I'm sure it was old lo mein sitting around. My order of chicken fried rice was disgusting, chicken was slimy, UNSURE IF IT WAS CHICKEN AT ALL. I regret going here, never again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my goto place for a quick and tasty pick up. They serve good quantity at that price. Have been here multiple times and always satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm from jersey and it took me almost a year to find great Chinese food . Pork fried rice is amazing ! Only issue is when I call to place an order the person understands zero English. It's hard placing orders when two people don't understand each other."}
{"text":"Can't speak for other Chinese restaurants in Charlotte, but this place was close to me and I had never had it before.

The teriyaki chicken sticks were a little charred and burned but were decent. I had the general tso chicken with spicy shrimp and white rice and it was at least pretty decent. No bad things about the food at all

Delivery was speedy and faster than the time they told me.

As I try more places in the area I'll update again when I can compare it to other Chinese places. As of now, it's just decent Chinese. Not bad or horrible but it won't knock your socks off either."}
{"text":"I love this Chinese spot it's actually one of the best Chinese food spots I've ever been to in Charlotte. I would drive half way across town to this place. I recommend this to everyone. Food very fresh and very clean."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese restaurant.  I've ordered delivery from here several times for lunch and they are always spot on the estimated delivery time.  I probably would not have tried this one if it weren't for delivery because there is another place closer to me, but when I am too lazy to drive I always order from here as the quality is about the same between the two."}
{"text":"The food was great, I had the beef & broccoli, it was very good but needed a little more beef. The Crab Rangoon & chicken wings were overfried and while they had good flavor they were hard."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss , I eat there a few times a month because it is close by my house . I had the orange chicken combo . It was good but a little over cooked . The girl who works there is very nice ."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this place quite regularly but, no more. The first incident was I found a long black straight hair in my food that I'd had delivered and when I let them know they claimed it could not be anyone there b/c they wear hairnets and even asked if I could drive up there.No.(I didnt have my car that evening). I also, have dreadlocks, so, I know it wasnt my own. They gave me the run around and didnt want to replace my food or money. They eventually, about an hr later brought me some more...an hr later!? They're literally 5 mins from my house. Second incident months later was they messed up my order. My mom was in town from Tx and I told her they were good so we ordered. They not only messed up my order but, they messed up my mom's order and acted very nasty when I called to let them know. I did not call with an attitude but, once I got one thrown back at me, I decided I was threw with them. Decent food or not, I will not be disrespected multiple times and keep patronizing your business."}
{"text":"The dining area and the tables looked really good and clean. The menu was a regular Chinese menu. To be on the safer side I went with the regular chicken fried rice; there were hardly any other customers so I made a to go order. My order came in a few minutes.

The fried rice was the most bland dish I have ever tasted. It was just rice mixed with some pieces of artificially looking white chicken pieces.

Two star because the ambience was better. I wouldn't want to go there again."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Chinese food and with that comes several run ins with terrible Chinese establishments both buffet and normal style. This place is good. Some may even argue excellent. Try it out"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp lo mein and shrimp egg rolls crab Rangoon for delivery. Order gets here and it's chicken lo mein wtf my gf is a pescatarian so all she could eat were the egg rolls lo mein was average"}
{"text":"I like the shrimp with garlic sauce, the shrimp with broccoli and the shrimp lo mein. I like everything I've tried so far. The egg rolls are hit or miss. We order here a lot the food is good, big portions and the prices are good."}
{"text":"First of all, my review for Chinese food is always going to be more harsh, since I have tried some of the best Chinese food.  Plus a Chinese native that traveled to Hong Kong once a year, nothing beats authentic food in HK!!!

I placed a delivery order, and it got here within 20 minutes. I have the lunch sha cha shrimp and fried potsticker. The flavor of the shrimp is pretty good, and it's jumbo size shrimp. However the sauce it's bit too thick to my taste. There's nothing to said about the potsticker, just out of the package kind, but the dipping sauce has a bit of sweetness and spicy to it.

Lunch combo is $5.65, price not bad at all. Oh and they gave me package sauces that going to last me a month lol... 

I will order from this place again on a lazy day that I don't want to drive out for food."}
{"text":"I've been to several chinese restaurants and buffets in the Charlotte area and this is one of the best ones. My family and I have been coming here for years and we all really enjoy the food at this place. We have tried several things on the menu and have never been disappointed. The food here is really good and they can accomodate to any preferences you might have with a certain meal. Definitely a great place to try if you want some good chinese food or want to try something new!"}
{"text":"Singapore Mei was Fun!!  I was hungry and enjoyed every bit of the Singapore Mei Fun with Chicken and Shrimp.  It was medium spicy, but had somewhat red pepper flakes too many.  Very tasty indeed and this was my first time in this takeout joint.  I always look around for cleanliness and it was adequate.  Only the light fans were collecting dust.  I did make an interesting observation...where I normally eat, the cooks are asian, but here, they are latino.  They did make a fantastic dish."}
{"text":"We ordered the sesame chicken with lo mein for delivery. They were super fast and the food comes in these cute containers instead of the basic styrofoam plates or boxes. Its an original taste and special sauce compared to other Chinese places. We will order again very soon."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Chinese food. The fried rice taste like white rice and does not have the traditional egg mixed in. The sweet and sour sauce is bitter and stale. The pork in the egg rolls is bright red grounded meat. The mix of flavors with the vegetables is very off. The only item that was passable was the orange chicken. 

The second star is just for effort and not being overly salty."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nasty along with the managers personality as well and they messed up on your order she will give you a refund maybe but will not be nice to you I found a bug in my food see you just took the bug out to save the food most likely ready for resell. Asian restaurants Do not like to give a refund or credit but yet they want your money? Should you be eating here? This is the month of June and I would never eat there again after when I see employees do not wash their hands after coming from the restroom taking Hand towel to kill To kill Flies. No more \" Enough is a Enough Definitely don't want my plate to look like these photos? These photos have nothing to do with their restaurant but I wouldn't want this one day on my plate. To the manager get a better personality you're in America taking  Getting our service and then going to talk about us and treat us with the attitude in your language in front of our face. I could understand some of your language and I have seen this go on for many Asian people for manicures to food service."}
{"text":"I used to order twice a week from this place but every time I order online it gave me one price and delivery was a totally different price like $4 more not including the tip. Last week I ordered (3) 8 piece wings and only received 4 pieces in each....missing like 12 wings!!! Called back to get the wings, the lady said rudely \"They were whole wings\" which had nothing to do with the 8 I ordered. I asked to have them redelivered..she then put me on hold for 5 minutes and stated she has to make $$ too and can't give me the wings...What??? My order history showed I order all the time but no loyalty. Ended up sending me only 4 wings...Good food but Bad service"}
{"text":"I've only ate here once. I stopped here and ordered some takeout for my wife and I. She got the honey chicken combo and I got beef with broccoli. I was told 10 minutes but, it took 25 they were really busy so I kind of let it slide since I really wasn't in much of a rush. The pork eggrolls were pretty damn good and so were the fried dumplings. The beef broccoli was pretty good the broccoli tasted pretty fresh to me. The honey chicken on the other hand I had mixed feelings about. It was kind of a mess honestly. The chicken looked completely off it didn't really look like chicken some of the pieces looked like beef so I wasn't really fond of that my wife thought it was ok but ehhh....wasn't that amazing for me. On the other hand the prices there are pretty well priced. A good thing is for the people who only speak Spanish they got a girl there that speaks Spanish so she can help with that which is a BIG plus.

All in all, its an ok place stuff is pretty good for the price plus I found this place off of Yelp so I just followed suit and gave it a taste."}
{"text":"I love this place and order from here all the time. Everything I've ordered has been delicious and delivery is fast."}
{"text":"Mint Hill doesn't have a huge selection of Chinese restaurants, so I was really wanting to like this restaurant. I've eaten there about 6 times and the food was okay, but somewhat bland. Price was fine, portions were also fine.  The worst thing that I found from this restaurant is that every time  (but one) my boyfriend's order was wrong when we got it home. DISAPPOINTING.  How can you get someone's order wrong 5 out of 6 times?!  Anyway, we'll keep searching for a new Chinese takeout in/around  Mint Hill."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning. Ordered sesame chicken combo. 2 hours later I was vomiting which continued for 16 hours. China NO fun."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery here a few times. The food here is just ok. Its average cheap food. But when you don't feel like cooking, why not?  I ordered two items and only received one.... After they called me back because they couldn't remember if it was delivery or not. They still didn't get it right... My last 2 attempts at ordering delivery from them have been terrible... Theres there's plenty of other options around."}
{"text":"Not a lot has changed at the China Fun in the last two years - they still serve food on actual plates, with real silverware, and the dining room is still an impressive size.  I'm really somewhat amazed that they are still in business after all this time.  Frankly I figured that I'd come back in and the original review would be a few months old - not two years!

The service has actually picked up a bit, which is why I'm giving them another star, but the food is pretty much the same.  If you get your typical dishes (like General Tsos Chicken), it's heavy on the sauce.  I'd suggest trying something like a Pepper Beef instead - the sauce is a lot lighter, and you'll probably enjoy it more."}
{"text":"I love Chin Fun ! The chicken & broccoli w/ garlic sauce the pork low main is excellent . The service is exceeding good . And FAST  delivery . Tops on all my choices here in
Charlotte / Mint Hill area ."}
{"text":"Fried rice was great.   Though hard to mess up.  As for the entrees, it is the furtherest from authentic Chinese that I've encountered.  Ketchup based entrees ughh.  This place is great if you don't care what you put in your mouth and need to fill a quick hunger.  If you are looking for taste, turn the other way."}
{"text":"Omg why is it so hard to find good Chinese takeout in Matthews, this place was ok but now it's disgusting. I hate to be that person that says this but am I eating chicken? It taste funny and how are my wontons stale??? So disappointed , I hate wasting money on food"}
{"text":"Just your typical Chinese takeout restaurant. Nothing to special. I ordered the General Tso and it was better than most but just average still. The egg roll wasn't burnt like most places so that was good. The price was right for the quality of food and the owner (I'm assuming) was nice. The only thing I would suggest to the owner is to work on the inside decor. There was a supply rack right beside the front register where you order."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here yesterday and i have to say theyre eggrolls are amazing and rice is ok, but the orange chicken that i ordered just wasnt cutting it, it had a really weird taste to it. Im not sure if it had to much of the orange peel in it or........ but something was really off."}
{"text":"When it comes to Chinese takeout, China Fun gets 5 stars. Another one that is closest to what I grew up with back in NY."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter ordered sesame chicken a few days ago. Both orders came without sesame, so she called the store and was told to return at her convenience and her order would be replaced at no charge. Today, she returned to get her sesame chicken and the owner was there. The owner said that she would not replace the order and offered a 3.00 compensation to include both messed up orders. As she said this she put the fresh sesame chickenb orders behind the counter, as if afraid they may be stolen. For this she lost three good customers as we ordered from this place frequently. Their cheapness has lost them both customers and money. I hope this shortsighted person learns her lesson as we won't be back."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry and brittle. It tasted either old or burnt it was hard to tell. Be warned in advance!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food but I ordered shrimp and broccoli and it was decent just wished it was more sauce in the bowl but overall decent place"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to China Fun. The food wasn't great, but it was edible.  Even worse  for me was the lack of service we got from the time we walked in to the time we left. 
The girl behind the counter was engrossed on her phone.  She never said Hello or Welcome or even smiled. I gave her the first order which she took then she went back on her phone.  I said the second order and she told me to repeat it because she wasn't listening to me as she was on her phone  texting. She barely made eye contact. This should have been my cue to leave but I didn't. When the food was ready, she told us and we got it and left.  Not a Good bye, Thank you, Come again, or anything of the sort.  
I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"This place delivers to my house, pretty consistent and best out of available delivery in the area."}
