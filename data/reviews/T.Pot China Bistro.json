{"text":"Incredible food & atmosphere! I've lived near here for years & have driven & walked past this restaurant thousands of times & snubbed it based on a previous experience by a colleague. I had very grateful & appreciative clients of mine recently take me here and I was most pleasantly surprised! Extremely well prepared and presented. Excellent food, selection, prices and service. Returned recently with family to explore the menu more. Best dim-sum in town!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Let's start with service. This place's service, along side with Sun's BBQ restaurant has by far the worse service or customer service I've ever received. Now, some reviewers believe it is a racial thing. I can tell you it's not because I am Chinese. When I order I speak Chinese, so it's not a race thing. I hear that they don't get paid well there, that's probably why.  Anyhow, I can tell you that one time where I ordered out of the menu, gave them the item number and they recited it back to me and when the food arrived it was wrong. I told the bus person that it was not what we ordered, she told me she was not the server and walked away. Our server came back, and asked me what was wrong. I told her it was not what I ordered, and we didn't want to take someone else's food. To my surprise, instead of checking our order she told me on the spot that it WAS what I ordered, and told me I was wrong. HA wow...ok. Still trying to be nice I told her maybe she should check the order because I am sure it's not what I had ordered. She rolled her eyes, walked away and came back and insisted that it was what I ordered. It says so in her note pad. Filled with anger by this point, I looked at her and over to my friend and I said, \"let's go\". We got up and proceeded to leaving the restaurant. She was shocked, stood there for a few seconds and told her manager/cash person about it. She came up to me and asked me what was wrong. I told her what just happened, and she said she will find out what was wrong. (No apology) Trying not to make a scene we returned to the table. A few minutes later she came back and told us it was a miscommunication. The kitchen had read the order wrong, and they will proceed to making the correct dish now. (Still no apology)   My friend and I decided to stay because we were starving. We ate as fast as we could and asked for our bill. Every one knows when you're in a Chinese restaurant, don't ever expect a compensation when they screw up. If you didn't know, well now you do. Getting our bill I noticed that they had charged the extra dish that they got wrong, I gave the bill back to her and told her it was wrong. She ripped the bill out of my hand and threw down a new one. Well no tips were given that night.  Now on to the food. There was one place in time when their service wasn't that bad. My family had dim sum there on a few occasions. The variety was ok, some unique dim sum that is house special and it's steamed fresh when ordered (it's like a sushi list in scantron form. You fill out the bubble of the item you want). Quality is OK, not exceptional, but let me tell you that if you had allergies to MSG or high blood pressure...steer clear. They drench everything in MSG, I swear.  Now on to dinner, their portions are small and food is really not that exceptional. You can get better quality and price from another restaurant. We ordered ribs one time, and for $16 there were only 6 bones that barely had meat on them. That's almost $3 for a Pedigree dental bone. Same as dim sum, MSG and sodium levels are off the charts.   To end my uber long review (apologies for the length), I will say that the only time that I will ever return is if I was invited for a wedding banquet there."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the most popular dim sum restaurants in the area as there is always a wait to be seated. The waiting area inside is also pretty small and can get really crowded so go early or be prepared to wait outside unless you want people right in your face.  The food here is pretty good but on the pricier end. They also charge your per person for tea whether you drink it or not. Their menu mainly consists of the regular dim sum items with not much specialty or western choices, which means it's catered more toward Asians. The food choices are quite authentic and varied enough that you're not only ordering the same thing but with a different filling.   The Bistro side of the restaurant is a Hong Kong style cafe where you can get rice and noodle dishes but you can also order off the dim sum menu. The lunch special on this side can be pretty filling as it comes with soup, toast, a drink, and the lunch of the day served with rice or spaghetti for a decent price.  The service is not the greatest, especially on the Bistro side where most of the ladies are quite rude. Overall, it's one of the better dim sum places and we typically leave pretty satisfied because of the quality and flavour of the food."}
{"text":"Has mediocre dim sum. Make reservations if you plan to come on a weekend! It took them 15 mins to give me a number to wait for a table... Needs a more organized waiting system."}
{"text":"This is my favourite dim sum restaurant in Calgary. It is owned by the same family that owns Calgary Court Cafe, Sun Chiu Kee, and the Forbidden City.   On Saturday it is busier than a bee hive, and just as noisy. You do not dine here for the ambience; you dine here to be tantalized by some of the most exquisite tid bits of Hong Kong cuisine imaginable.  My personal loves are the shrimp chung fun (shrimp wrapped in rice rolls with oil and soy), pork shu mai (rice paper dumplings), chicken feet in black bean (needs no explanation), and har gow (shrimp dumplings). If I stuff myself silly, then I will add cold duck webs, short ribs in black bean, and shrimp stuffed green pepper.  When I was in university, we used to have contests as to who can get the highest dollar value on their bill at a dim sum restaurant. I have seen a few local students doing the same thing.  Their tea leaves a little to be desired but they will accomodate you if you bring something incredible from Ten Ren's which is a 30 second jaunt across the parking lot.  Sit in the area to the right of the entrance, it is not as noisy as the main dining area."}
{"text":"My partner came in on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. We ordered quite a bit of dim sum - pan-fried Chinese cured pork and mushroom buns (it seems that the bun is actually a mushroom), steamed chicken and ginger buns, rice crepe wrapped Chinese dough with crispy dried pork on top, steamed custard and coconut rolls, pan fried taro cake, BBQ pork bun with butter and sugar, steamed chiu chow dumplings, crab meat and pork dumplings, and the baked BBQ pork pastry. The baked BBQ pork pastry was super sweet and delicious, much like the BBQ pork buns with butter and sugar. The steamed chiu chow dumplings were probably my favourite. The service was pretty average and everything arrived quickly. Though it seems like large groups may have some waiting issues, we had a fantastic experience with just two of us."}
{"text":"I've been here three or four times now, and each time I've left completely satisfied.  Unlike the Chinatown dimsum spots, at T.Pot, you get a menu and write down how many orders of each dish you want.  This can be a problem if (A) you're not Chinese; (B) you can't read Chinese; (C) you don't really understand their detailed, yet slightly generic English translations.  For instance, all I wanted was siu mai, which according to Wikipedia is a \"pork and mushroom dumpling.\"  That was so not on the menu, and even going with a bunch of friends who knew way more Chinese than I did didn't help the situation.  Using the words \"noodle\" and \"dumpling\" also don't convey all of the meaning that their Chinese counterparts would =/  The English situation might not be any better at other dim sum restaurants, but at least there you can see the menu items as the cart ladies pass by.  What I did get, though, was delicious.  The ha gow and siu mai were not as good as at other restaurants in the city, but they did come with 5 instead of just 4 items.  Also, the large selection that they can afford to offer -- using their sushi bar-like menu instead of the cart ladies -- means that you can try so many different types of dim sum!  I really liked their pumpkin law mai go (sponge cake) and their Chinese fried donuts were also fantastic (sauce was GREAT!).  The fried BBQ pork rolls were OK.  Overall, though, great experience, great bang for the buck, and you'll definitely be full!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, minus the fact that they overdosed on salt and msg. The service was awful. Only waited about 5 minutes for our seats though."}
{"text":"Located across from the T&T market in Harvest Hills the T-Pot is made up of two sides.  On the \"Restraunt\" side you will find dim sum during the day until 2 p.m. and a dinner menu after 5 p.m.  The dim sum is very tasty and offers more variety than what is offered in Chinatown.  I also like that they bring you the food fresh from the steamer so it stays very hot unlike the \"old way\" where they push the carts around to the tables - you never know how long that steamer has been sitting on that cart.  They offer both a chinese menu and an english menu and you just mark off what you want and the servers will bring you the dimsum straight to your table.  This is also one of the few places that offers abalone rice crepes which I find divine.  The dinner menu also offers many dishes that you cannot find at any other Chinese restraunt in Calgary.  I highly recommend the salted mackrel with gai-lan.   You should note that if you order a dinner here on the restaurant side that they serve you their house special dessert for free.  It's a great way to finish off the evening.    Side 2 is the Bistro style set up.  This is where you can get a bowl of noodle soup or congee with what I classify as snacks like chicken wings and spring rolls.  I highly recommend their seafood baked rice dish with cream sauce...rinse it down with a milk tea and you'll be screaming DELISH.  Parking is free but I always have to park further out because it's always busy."}
{"text":"We like T.Pot for dinner and takeout, so 4 of us went for dim sum on a Sunday morning. It was fantastic! We had been to the Silver Dragon recently, and this dim sum is better. It may be the best I've had. Everything we had was hot, fresh tasting and SO flavourful.   We made reservations for 10:30 and I would highly recommend this if you can because the resto was packed by the time we left. You definitely want to miss the after-church crowd.  The service is very good for dim sum because you pick from a menu instead of waiting for carts. The servers brought us fresh tea at regular intervals and anything else we asked for immediately, including hot sauce.   Lots of families.It gets pretty loud, but that's all part of the fun.  Food ****** Atmosphere **** Service ****"}
{"text":"Dim sum was super, service was crap. Dinner was mediocre.  Dim sum was pretty good comparing to other dim sum places in Calgary, but service was not up to par...our order was missed, the server didn't look like he knew what he was doing and he kind of ignored us. We asked another server and the food came after like 30min...then we ordered a plate of noodles and they gave us fried rice...we asked again and the server's got a bit of attitude, like \"ya we made a mistake, so what\".  There were so many people waiting for seats at lunch time, the service may be better when the restaurant is not as busy."}
{"text":"Pros:  - extensive menu of dishes, you can order from both the restaurant menu and cafe menu - food tastes great, i really enjoy their dimsum and cafe dishes - price is decent and on par w other places - pretty much open all day, service is quick and nicer than an average Chinese place  Cons:  - I find the restaurant dinner menu is more expensive and portion is smaller. If you want something in the area i would recommend GingerBeef Bistro for dinner instead. - at dinner, can only get the free dessert soup (thon sui?) if you sit in the restaurant area, not the cafe one. So if you order from both menus i would recommend sit in the restaurant area."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it first opened as it's convenient in the NW. The food is good. I like the unique dishes that they feature on their menu every month.   This will likely no longer be our go to spot anymore as 3 times out of 6 in the past 4 months we have had horrible service to the point where we were extremely offended.  I am not a high maintenance customer by any means when it comes to restaurant dining but when I requested if I could add an extra dish to our order 5 minutes after our waitress had punched it in I was scolded in Chinese \"why didn't you tell me before? now I have to enter it in again\". I'm not too sure what prompted that response from our server as the restaurant was half empty at 5:15 pm and her section only had one other table with four people.   My mother asked the same server politely if she could bring two glasses of water to us. She brought it out 15 minutes later slamming them on the table (it seemed with intent) so that water and ice splashed out all over. If she was having a bad day herself or from other customers she should surely not have transferred that to us.   When we finished our meal, my husband got up and went to the server stand to ask our server for a take out box for the left over dishes as she did not come over during our meal to check how the food was or fill our drinks (he said this in English as he doesn't speak Chinese) she came over and inspected our table to make sure that we actually had food left. She said to me in Chinese \"I didn't think you had any food left so I'm not sure why he would have asked me for a box\" when we clearly had almost two full dishes left as we ordered a bit too much.  Tonight we went back with just our children. We asked to sit on the more casual side as we had our baby and toddler and didn't want the formal dishes. One of the servers put my name on the waiting list as all the tables were full. The other servers clearly saw us standing there waiting to be seated. As a table left, they started to clean it off. Instead of addressing us to the table, a couple that had just waltzed through the door quickly ran to the table and sat down while it was still being cleared. The hostess looked at them then looked at us and pretended she saw nothing.   I requested a highchair for our baby when finally another table became available and the hostess acknowledged my question but did not bring a highchair over. I had to go to the front of the restaurant to get it myself.   All the wait staff seemed grumpy like they always do and during the entire meal we never had our drinks and water refilled and no one came by to check on how the food was. Typical.  I tend to think that service is usually lacking in Chinese restaurants compared to Japanese and Western restaurants. Customer service is usually not their forte but 3 out of 6 times with horrid and down right rude service is a bit too frequent even for me and I've been eating out at Chinese restaurants since I was young so it takes a lot to shock me.  It's a shame as I really like TPot and have liked them for many years but the servers' lack of general common courtesy and manners is not a dining experience that I enjoy subjecting me, my friends or my family to."}
{"text":"When my fiance and i hit up the North side, we always make a trip to T.Pot and then to T & T after.   We really like the dim sum here - brought my parents here and they liked it too. This is from very picky chinese parents.   The downside is that it's kind of pricy here.  The atmosphere is nice, it's always buzzing with business and it's not dingy dirty. It's rather clean for a chinese restaurant.   The service is allright - we always get what we ask for (water, tea refills and chili sauce). At other chinese restaurants, they slam the tea cups down and ignore you as if you're the wall.   This is definitely a place i would bring my friends and family to. It's great!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant over the weekend for dim sum. There was long queue so the anticipation was quite high at the beginning. I ordered: crispy squid tentacles,which was very good, crispy, salty and a little spicy. I also ordered Hongkong style eggplant - it came out exactly like the squid, using the exact same crispy topping which is deep fried chopped garlic and chili. Quite disappointing, they should have explained it in the menu. I also ordered turnip cake with XO sauce. I really like the dish -crispy on the outside and soft in the inside, very savory - even tho the XO sauce is barely there. For the dessert, I ordered mango pudding, which is just so so - taste like instant pudding out of the box.  I had a such a high hope for this restaurant but it turns out to be just another Chinese restaurant in Calgary. I have had a lot better Chinese food in Singapore, Hongkong, even Dubai and yet to find one here in Calgary with the same standard."}
{"text":"Great dim sum place. Definitely worth the drive if you don't live nearby.   A hot tip is the desert, the tapioca, aloe, mango and grapefruit dish is what one would expect to have on a hot day in Hong Kong. It should be tried at least once in a lifetime."}
{"text":"I've been here for crazy busy dim sum Sunday mornings and less intense weekday dinners and the food always brings me back because it's so darn good. Yes, the dim sum is a bit expensive ($4-$5 a dish) compared to the places in Chinatown, but I'm not complaining about paying a little more for convenience of location.   Like usual Chinese restaurants, service is subpar and English is hard to come by but if you're up for trying more traditional Chinese food and away from the westernized Ginger Beef and chicken balls, T.Pot is the place for that."}
{"text":"Well the wontons are great but the soup is subpar. The beef stew lacked flavor and meat or tendons. The dim sum is pretty good and I would rate it above average. The service is lacking here. I've had been to better Hong Kong style cafes but it was conveniently located near the airport and Asian market."}
{"text":"The best ginger beef in the city!  Yes, a bold opening statement, however having eaten in this city for decades now, it is fair to say this place is the place for ginger beef.  The rest of the food is decent, although I wasn't impressed with the pork dumplings."}
{"text":"Chinese new years is around the corner and we wanted to get some dim sum. Luckily we were planning to go to TnT for grocery so we made it a trip to go to T.Pot as well. We got to the restaurant at 11:30am and it was very very busy! We asked for a table for 5 (1 kid) and waited about 15 min. However, just a tip to everyone, when you enter the restaurant there are two sides. One side is the 'main restaurant' the right side is very casual 'HK Style' restaurant and we found out they also serve dim sum as well as their HK style menu. The right side typically have a shorter wait list, so I highly recommend putting your name on the right side if the left side is too busy. If you want the left side of the restaurant I highly recommend getting there earlier.  Food here is good for dim sum and dinner. I would say the price for formal dining is pricy. Service is mediocre (cant expect much from a Chinese restaurant)"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in the city. I love how they serve more authentic Chinese than they do Western Chinese. It's very refreshing. It gets incredibly busy, and you will likely have to wait for a table. If you want good dim sum and good Chinese food, T-Pot is the way to go."}
{"text":"Great food but with rudest and racist servers!! These people don't even know what manners and respect is. Siomai's are only for lunch which is sad."}
{"text":"Decent Dim Sim but not super. No carts so you have to rely on cryptic menu."}
{"text":"We decided to try TPot for dim sum since we live in the NW and didn't really feel like driving downtown.  We arrived and the place was PACKED. A hostess was at the front taking down info for those waiting.  Don't be too shy because you will get plowed down as those behind you take your spot in the line.  We were told the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes for a table for 3 but we only waited about 5 minutes.  The dim sum was fast, hot & flavorful.  At T.Pot you order off of a menu card as there are no carts.  We are avid dim sum'ers but we had a bit of trouble figuring out some of our \"usual\" choices.  Overall, I would say that we like dim sum at Forbidden City and Regency Palace better."}
{"text":"This is the best most consistent restaurant. For Chinese food in the North as they even time the delivery from the time you order the food and delivery time to your table for the freshness and best taste of the Dim Sum. Dinner is very good too."}
{"text":"Considered as one of the best dim sum place in Calgary. Just b ready to spend some extra dollars. I like their cooking except the chicken feet. Snow palace s king on dat one."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN MY FAVOURITE DIM SUM PLACE... EVER!!!!  Sorry, I don't mean to yell but I just love the dim sum here.    The rice rolls are quite good - not quite as yummy as the rice rolls at King Noodle in Toronto but the soy dipping sauce is a little better.    Just order as much as you possibly can because its ALL good!  The decor is quite lovely.  Modern and sleek.  Not the typical cheesy asian restaurant.    I don't think I've ever been disappointed.    Go now!!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I ate at T-Pot tonight for the very first time.  I was a guest at a  Chinese Wedding Banquet.  Accordingly, it was a set 13 dish menu, which was selected for us.  The service was very quick.  The food was plentiful (very large quantities).  I didn't eat everything because there was a lot of fish/seafood that I just don't care for, but what I ate, I certainly enjoyed.  The staff worked quickly.  Certainly no complaints about the food or the service.  And because I was a guest, I have no idea if the prices were high/low//reasonable, so really can't comment on pricing.  I am giving only 4 stars instead of 5 stars because I visited the ladies room 3 times while I was there and it really needed attending to ...  badly!  Also, the microphone/sound system  that were provided for the speeches etc. were poor quality - it sounded like a \"tin\" feedback of some kind.    I would definitely go back.  (I took various photos of the food which I will post on here if I can figure out how to do so, because the dishes were impressive - especially the lobster!)"}
{"text":"8 of us after movie. Got here at 9pm, kitchen still open with half seats full. The service was on time. Dishes coming quick. Ordered fried wasabi shrimp. Fried beef dice, fried seasonal beans, pork ribs and hot spicy chickens.rice comes in A Bucket."}
{"text":"The place has delicious food that really gets my taste buds moving, the only problem seems to be the service where most servers and employees of the place is usually ignorant and depends on us to find our seats without giving a proper introduction. The food again was amazing, just the service needs some work. The only exception was because we were the same nationality as them (Chinese) and spoke the same language, though when I spotted a different nationality that was sitting across from me, the servers were all very quiet to them and was more ignorant to them than those with the same nationality. Atmosphere around the restaurant was very lovely, clean, and modern which to me was a good factor of the restaurant. Menu was simple and had a very wide variety of foods to select from, and you have the ability to order food in the middle of whatever corse you're on. Amount of people was so far half of the full capacity from when I was eating dinner.   In conclusion, this restaurant is a very nice, clean place. It has delicious food and a wide variety of food which can be chosen from in any point as you dine. The only problem is the service and the ignorance the servers put to their jobs, especially to different nationalities which in Canada, should have a warm welcome. Thus, giving this restaurant a four star.  Don't stop your delicious food from exiting the kitchen, but do put more love into your customers. :)"}
{"text":"Good dining experience for my gf and I. My favs were the dumpling soup and the s&p squid which hwas fresh. Girlfreind liked their clams stu, not for me..though."}
{"text":"T.Pot China Bistro is kinda a \"unique\" restaurant.  I say unique is because the restaurant is split into two sections: (1) Dim Sum and (2) Hong Kong Cafe Style  Food from both Dim Sum and Hong Kong Cafe is good.  What really turns me off about this place is definitely their service.  (Really, what service?!)  I think the waiters and waitresses are trained to avoid their customers.  It is such a challenge to wave down someone to take orders.  What really bugs me is that I ordered a drink, the drink was ready and it was just sitting on the counter.  If everyone was busy, I can understand the wait.  But the fact is that I see waiters and waitresses walking by it and didn't deliver my drink.  I was so tempted to grab the drink from the counter myself.  Other than the service, you have to prepare to wait for a long period of time before you get seated.  I realize that it does not matter what time of the day you go (unless you go right when they open), there is at least a 20 minutes wait.    Besides all the negatives, food is decent.  Just remember, when you go to this restaurant, think of the food (the positive) and hopefully you can ignore the service or lack thereof and the prolong waiting period (the negatives)."}
{"text":"This should almost be 2 reviews since T.Pot consists of 2 establishments, both serving up some solid Chinese and HK style offerings. The one side (T.Pot) is more of a traditional dining setup with a more formal menu of classic regional Chinese dishes. The other side (Cafe HK) is a Hong Kong teahouse serving up mostly casual fare. Personally, I like the latter since there are a wide selection of items from laksa to Hainanese Chicken Rice to agedashi tofu. As with any good HK teahouse, you'll find that hybrid style of cooking reminiscent of dorm room meets Chopped. The Cafe does a great job as the service is quick and friendly. The moment you are seated, you can count on having your tumbler of tea delivered soon after. On the wall, Chinese soap operas constantly play in the background but are not distracting from the dining experience. As I said, the cafe specializes in the casual eating experience, and if you're in the mood for something a little more refined, there's always T.Pot.  I like the fact that there is something here for everyone, no matter what your preferences are. The pricing is fair, the food is delicious and the service is quick and efficient. Definitely a great place to go for a good HK snackhouse experience when you're out in the burbs. When you're done, you can visit T&T, which is conveniently located across the parking lot."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant in the 'Taste of Asia' group located in Northwest Calgary.  It is popular for dim sum, but this time we went for supper as a group of 4.  There are two sides to the restaurant and we chose the more traditional sit-down regular Chinese dinner side, vs the HK style cafe side.  Atmosphere: 4/5.  Overall good, comfortable and clean environment.  We were seated in a booth and it was not too loud or quiet.  There was also enough parking as it is part of a mall with T&T and other stores.    Food: 4/5  I really like the menu items at T.Pot as they usually add an interesting and creative twist to more traditional Chinese dishes.  This time we ordered the (special) ling cod soup, stir fried cod with tofu, lobster with fried vermicelli, fried rice with roe, fried chicken wasabi and enoki mushroom w bean sprouts.  It also came with free 'tong shui' with beans and kelp.  I liked all of the dishes, esp the dessert which is quite different from other more standard desserts like red bean or sweet tofu at other Chinese restaurants.  Price: 3/5  Maybe slightly higher than other chinese restaurants I have been at.  Service: 3/5  Our orders arrived at a reasonable time.  Overall satisfactory as for a Chinese restaurant.  Overall: 4/5  I like T.Pot for their creative menu items, overall good atmosphere, and would definitely come back again for dim sum or dinner to try some of their new items!"}
{"text":"Food is very good here. If you want to try Hong Kong style dishes, this is definitely the place to go.  Don't expect good service or clean washrooms, you may even have to wipe your cutlery and dishes before using them.  Just pretend you're in Hong Kong"}
{"text":"Sweet pork belly, crispy deep fried chicken with garlic and peanuts, seafood fried rice and battered shrimp with special yolk sauce were all good. Deep fried oysters were terrible. Too much batter. Food took long to come out, though. Hot sauce was tasty as it was mild and had garlic in it. Clean restaurant with modern furniture and decor. Good for family style dinners."}
{"text":"Always wondered what it would be like here, the parking lot is always packed! Thought on a Friday at 230pm, it would be a good time for an introductory lunch with a few less patrons - wrong! Still busy! We walked in and it was a tad awkward. There is a hostess stand but we never once saw anyone standing there. We were finally led to a table in the dim sum room near the doors - it was freezing so being a warm jacket just in case!(Note, they close this area down at 3pm for the afternoon) Our waitress did not speak a lick of English so lack of service cannot really be blamed on anyone. We were near the only Caucasian people in the whole place so at least that upped my confidence that the food would be good! There was more than one menu as well as a page to mark things off on. We did not know whether a food cart would come by and then we marked off what we ate or what. Long story short - we ordered 2 dim sum dishes off the sheet that came from the kitchen as well as 2 menu items. We got the pork in sweet pastry, the deep fried shrimp wontons, the salt and pepper squid and an order of chicken fried rice. Needless to say, this was too much food and we have lots for later.. Loved the tea that comes with the meal and they will always make sure you have plenty. The food here is good. Not Western style but the real thing. We were also shown a menu for I think where we should have likely sat down - at the 'noodle bar'. Would have saved time and 50% of our cash. It is called Hong Kong Cafe and dare I say it was like a restaurant within a restaurant. The pork in pastry was - odd but not in a bad way. I ate all my share but would not get it again. Wontons - very lightly fried and good amounts of shrimp packed inside. Served with a mayo that we avoided - would have loved some chili sauce with them. The squid was tasty and there was a lot of it. Came with nicely cooked garlic and red onion for flavor. Perfectly lightly fried. The rice was my fave. Not greasy, full of green onion and the texture of the rice was of perfect consistency. Would order that a million times over and you get a good portion of that too. Although communication was a no-go, I still managed to be able to get a glass of water and some soy sauce for the rice. If you are looking for authentic and a beehive of activity style restaurant, this is your place!"}
{"text":"The good...  A. Love the playful fusion attempted by the chefs. This is definitely HK style cafe food.   B. Love the ambience and decor. Somewhat upscale trendy meets warm sparkles.   C. Food is well cooked and seasoned, and pretty tasty. Presentation is also perfect!  The bad...  A. Every dish, unfortunately, has the same underlying taste, which if you know how to cook Chinese, it's garlic, ginger and spring onions, or garlic, spring onions, and chili. Either permutation, it makes for boring food and lacks depth for trendy bistro food.  B. Tidiness and general cleanliness in the dining and restroom areas need to be better. It's cluttery the moment you walk in and restrooms need more attention with so much traffic.  C. Pricing is very high, comparable to bistro food you'd get at Earls, but I don't feel like I am getting value when each dish is so small when served family style.  Coupled with the lack of depth in flavour, it's hard to justify dining here when other less trendy Chinese restaurants serve very similar flavours for a lot less. Ordering the same number of dishes averages at $30/person here, with no leftovers, when you can get it for $20/person, and 2 - 3 more servings to take home. Overall, the food value needs to be reviewed.  The ugly...  The servers provide terrible service. They act moody and often like they can care less to be there. The consistency of keeping up with our table and making sure we're taken care of is different with every visit, varying from mediocre to poor. I have never had a good server here with the number of times I've visited. Given the prices being charged and the type of experience the restaurant seems to want to parlay, they need to work on staff attitude, and general awareness and management of tables. If you want to be an expensive restaurant you've got to play the part.  In total...  I would love to love this place because I can see the potential and what it should be. Maybe I'll come back, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Very racist to white people!  My parents are vanilla as f$uck, but I asked them to meet me here for my birthday. They arrived first and put their name on \"the list\". We waited for 30 minutes while Asian people walked right in with no reservation and were seated right away. Finally after the 10th group walked in ahead of us, I protested with the hostess and she reluctantly seated us. When we sat down the waitress gave us forks and knives instead of chop sticks, and then when we asked for chopsticks the waitress laughed in our face and then went back to her colleagues, pointed at our table and they all had a good chuckle together at the white people who wanted chop sticks. Not accommodating, or friendly and service was slow, plus the food wasn't even that great. Not exactly a welcome environment, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is horrible. The servers practically throw the food at you. Not to mention the food is loaded with msg. We refuse to eat here. I will not pay for a meal let alone tip if we're not wanted."}
{"text":"This place is very busy during lunch to dinner because of their awesome dimsum menu and their Chinese menu in general.  I love the atmosphere of the place. Very good for a starving group of family/friends. Wide variety of food choices and their presentation of the food is good too. Mouth watering looking dimsum.  Spacious place though you have to wait during peek hours.   We also tried coming here 45 min before they closed and the food was still satisfying. Though I would have prefered if they still serve dimsum before they close. Sometimes I just have this late night dimsum cravings!   The only downside here probably is the servers are sometimes hard to understand or I don't know if they understood me or not or vice versa. Though since they got the orders right- i guess it's just me!   I'm also glad about their location here in Bedington! I don't have to go downtown to satisfy my dimsum cravings- though I still wish they serve dimsum late at night!"}
{"text":"After many years, I was back to tpot but this time for their dinner.  We ordered lots of food and every dish was excellent.  I have to say even better than most of the Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area.  Consider calgary's Asian population isn't as large as SF, I am very impressed of their dish quality.  No wonder this place is packed all the time and still around after many years."}
{"text":"I love going to T pot for dimsum. Their food has so much flavor. My favorite is their abalone sticky rice. No one makes sticky rice like they do. Only problem is this place is always busy. I don't even try to go on weekends."}
{"text":"Here is my straight forward review.  The food is great but the service is extremely bad!  Me and my family have been there for dim sum and dinner many times.  Absolutely no problem with the dim sum side.  However, the service on the Cafe side is very, very poor.  No issue with the food if the food comes out of the kitchen at reasonable time.  If you ordered multiple dishes, you might have to wait for a long, long time to get all your food.  Also, the servers on the Cafe side is extremely poor, or should I say very, very RUDE.  Two of us were there this evening.  When we showed up, there were less than a handful of customers but we were left standing at the front door by our-self for a long time.  We finally sat our-self down at an empty table.  We placed our order at around 5 pm with a waitress and did not get out of the place until 7 pm for 2 dishes.  A plate of fried rice and a place of fried vegetables.  First, the waitress forgot to enter our order into the system.  We can tell by looking at the time stamped on the order ticket. Then the food took forever to come out.  We tried to politely mention this to our waitress.  Instead of getting an apology or explanation, we were told that we should have ordered white rice instead of fried rice.  The white rice would have taken much less time.  This is not the first time that we have experienced poor/rude service, long wait time in general and long wait time for all the dishes to come out of the kitchen.  We keep going back because of the food and thinking that the service level will change/improve.  The poor experience this evening will be the final time that me and family will visit this business establishment.  I am just sharing my experiences.  Fell free to go try for yourself."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Chinese restaurant in Calgary. We came from Hong Kong and found this venue to be comparable to restaurants in Hong Kong and China as to the taste and selection. T Pot serves authentic Hong Kong style Cantonese dishes. The best dishes are Mei Cai Kou Roe and Deep Fried Filet. I love them all. They offered excellent Peking Duck course dinner and wonderful shark fin soup."}
{"text":"i am positive that this was the worst restaurant food I had so far in my life. I have been to authentic chinese resturant before but nothing like this.. if you dont know chinese DONT GO.. if you only speak english DONT GO.. if you think menu is just straght fwd it will just give you what it says.. Then you are WRONG. worst experience ever.. every single server tried to serve us didnt know a single word.. then how would i ask for anything let alone that when we finally order stuff.. came all weird.. for example: Menu would say beef noodle soup.. how hard can that be its beef noodle soup.. oh no.. it was beef with beef, beef intestine and beef balls.. should they not mention those in the menu? i guess not. we ordered shredded chicken laksha.. there was no chicken for sure but lots of triangular looking fish.. should they not include that on menu description plus when we asked the lady what those are.. she was unable to say single word.. she just gave us attitude for not knowing chinese and took the bowl away .. and we never figured out what the heck happend to that laksha bowl.."}
{"text":"Very noisy, crowded and busy place. If u go during the busy hours especially lunch u would have to wait for a while. Most of them can't speak/talk english but they can understand. There is variety of foods and they r pretty good."}
{"text":"Our friend recommended this place to us.  They were there 2 years ago when they were in Calgary for a trip to the Canadian Rockies. 2 weeks ago we were taking the same trip and stopped by the restaurant for a dim sum lunch.  It was excellent.  They have great selections of dim sum dishes and some are beyond the basic dishes.  Everything we ordered were excellent. The egg tarts were to die for.  Better than any places in NY area as well as some of the bakeries in HK.  But this place was pricey.  We ordered less than 10 dim sum dishes and the bill was over CAN$100."}
{"text":"This place has excellent dim sum! It's so good that you are probably going to have to wait a solid twenty minutes to be be seated while standing in the parking lot. They give you a disc that vibrates when your table is ready. The service is very quick once you're in. They are so busy that the servers take out all of the good lines and just get down to the business of getting you your meal. We giggled as servers yelled at each other for bringing the wrong orders to tables and quickly remedying the situation. When the food starting pouring onto the table we were delighted with AWESOME flavours and variety. Everything was truly excellent. Some leftovers came home with me to be enjoyed for the following dinner, which I wasn't hungry for because I was still so full from my meal in the morning. This is an experience to be enjoyed with others. Be sure to go there on an empty stomach and with plenty of spare buttons to repair bursting shirts."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the very American sounding name, this restaurant is legitimately Cantonese. The conjoining side is a more casual Hong Kong-style café, but T. Pot Bistro has the ambience of a slightly higher end Chinese restaurant and the food to back it up. Let's just say that my Asian parents - who are typically tough to please - were impressed. I read up on reviews prior to selecting the place, disregarding the 3.5 stars on Yelp because I've found that this is a typical rating for some of my favorite Chinese restaurants on the site since they often get dinged for service - but not food. And frankly, I don't trust Chinese restaurants that receive 5-star Yelp reviews across the board because it typically means that you're paying for the service and ambiance but might not be getting the authentic food (or the authentic experience).   So yes, the service certainly wasn't white-glove treatment, but still got us our order quickly and without fuss - even though we were only Mandarin speakers while most of the waitresses were clearly more comfortable in Cantonese. But T. Pot Bistro provided well-crafted, authentic Cantonese food with specialties that are hard to find in the US.   The steamed chicken in a wooden bucket and the stir-fried lotus root with pork belly were house specials and our two favorite dishes. We also ordered a shrimp and asparagus dish along with a ginger beef dish that were tasty but nothing mind-blowing. I've read great things about their pea shoot, enoki mushroom and dried scallop dish, but we didn't have room to order that as well. Food was served quickly, and was devoured equally quickly. It was so good, we considered returning to fit in dim sum the next morning before our flight because it starts at 9am which is early for most places in the states. I trust that their dim sum would be equally stellar.  Find more reviews about restaurants around Calgary, Banff and Jasper on my blog here: http://www.vcinthekitchen.com/exploring-alberta/"}
{"text":"I was there after long weekend so the place was not too busy. All the dim sums are pretty good.The fried rice with scallop and shrimp is better than other places. Congee size is quite small... 4 people max to share. If i want dim sum in Calgary i will come back to this place."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food in NW suburban Calgary.   Huge menu with hundred of items and food comes out fresh and delicious.   Dim sum offered here as well as Hong Kong style cafe food. Pricing is decent as well as portions are big.   Large restaurant with lots of booths and of course round tables with lazy Susan's.   Overall service is very good."}
{"text":"I have a MSG allergy and can usually tolerate it at restaurants. But wow, I can't have the food here, on both sides of the restaurant. I'll get a severe headache and have to crash for a few hours. It's that hard on my system. This being said it's my personal physical reaction.  The food taste alright but the service is horrible.... The servers just don't care. The washrooms are dirty and as for utensils and bowls I soak it in the cup of tea they give you. Of course I don't drink that cup of tea."}
{"text":"The food at this place is okay, but the service is the worst I've ever experienced in Calgary, therefore it only gets 1 star.  Every time I leave this place my blood boils, The Servers have no manners and are very rude.  We were there Saturday morning for dim sum and when the food came out, my wife asked the Server if she could get more of this peanut sauce that came with the dish.  The Server laughed and said \"I already gave lots on the dish\" and walked away."}
{"text":"Probably one of, if not the best spot for Dim Sum in NW Calgary   Tonight we ate at the Hong Kong Cafe side for a change - As soon as I got the menu I had to order the \"Curry Diced Beef Flank with Pizza\" ..........who wouldn't want Curry Diced Beef Flank with Pizza? lol   Everything we ordered was quite good, especially the egg noodle soup with pork chop - highly recommend it if you are a soup or a pork fan.  I'd give T.Pot a 5 star rating if I was just rating the Dim Sum as it is amazing, the H.K. cafe is good but not up to the same quality you'd expect after having the Dim Sum"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese cuisine and dim sum restaurant. They also have a hong kong cafe section serving equally gourmet food from the restaurant counterpart.  Try to avoid weekends and holidays, average wait time could be 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, although it's completely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really dissapointed by the staff here.  The waitress started speaking Cantonese to us because she thought we were Chinese. The waitress eventually walked off rudely after she realized we didn't speak Cantonese.  Despite the bad service, The food here is great."}
{"text":"Things you should know before going to T.Pot - it is almost always busy (especially for dim sum on the weekends - expect to wait from 15-45 minutes), the menu caters more authentic Chinese dishes with minimal western Chinese dishes, service isn't always spectacular but the food is good. I would probably rate T.Pot a 4.5/5. My only real issue is that service can be slow when they are real busy.  Most of that sums up T.Pot. In my opinion, T.Pot is probably one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in both Calgary and Edmonton. I've been here multiple times for both dim sum and dinner and I've never had a bad experience regarding how the food tasted.   Tip: if you go here for dim sum, try to make it before 10:45 am to avoid the long line.  You can make a reservation too but still expect that if it's around noon to have to wait for your table"}
{"text":"This place is always always busy. I think it's a fair reflection of the food and atmosphere here. It's divided into two units one for dim sum and more traditional Chinese food, the other section into a Hong Kong style cafe. Both have pretty excellent service, especially for a Chinese restaurant of such size. Food is tasty and presented very cleanly, and their selection is enormous.   Whether it's dim sum or a milk tea you are craving, this place will satisfy you. Oh but do expect a wait! Lines are always long!"}
{"text":"Came back from Vancouver, my first meal in Calgary was DimSum. After picking me up from the airport, my boyfriend took me to the closest Chinese Restaurant for breakfast. The name of the restaurant called T Pot China Bistro. It located on Harvest Hills Blvd North. The restaurant itself stands alone and its anchored by T&T Supermarket and many other restaurants. It was our first time having food at this place.   We stopped by the restaurant was very early Sunday morning. It was around 9:00 am when the restaurant just opened. It was not very busy at that time which was a great sign. We got a seat pretty after and began to order our meal. After discussed with each other, my boyfriend and I decided to order:   Steamed Chicken Feet in Special Sauce Steamed Spare Rib in Black Bean Sauce  steamed Shrimp Dumplings  Seafood & Meat Rolls in abalone Gravy  Baked BBQ Pork Pastry  Deep Fried Shrimp Spring Rolls  Rice Crepe Wrapped Chinese Dough with Crispy Dried Pork on Top  Baked Egg Tart   All the food came out of the kitchen was not so long. All the food was very fresh and well cooked, which was great. My favorite dishes in our orders are Steamed shrimp dumplings ($6.50), steamed chicken feet in special sauce ($5.95), and Rice crepe wrapped Chinese dough with crispy fried pork on top ($6.50). Steamed shrimp dumplings, there are 5 dumplings in the dish.One baby size one and other four are regular sized dumplings. The shrimp were very fresh and tasty. The Chicken feet was cooked till so soft with very special flavors on top, which was yummy. Rice crepe wrapped Chinese dough with crispy fried pork on top was my boyfriend's most favorite dishes. They provided us three different dipping sauces for this dish, such as sweet soy sauce, hoisin, and peanut sauce. My boyfriend preferred to dip it with peanut sauce more. I love the all three sauce combine together. So tasty. That was so much food for two of us and also was a pretty nice Dim Sum meal for us. We were super full in the end and we had to take two big boxes food back to home. The prices of the food were OK. Not too expensive and not too cheap. It was based on the size of the dish. The small dishes were $4.95 each, Mediums were $5.95, Larges were $6.50, the Special sizes were $7.50. It was not bad, we spent like $50.00 for dim sum and we still had lots of leftovers. Definitely, we will come back to T- Pot China Bistro again very soon. High recommend to people about this place."}
{"text":"Food was as I remembered from years ago. Came in for late light dinner. Even though there were many servers and there were lots of empty tables, no one would come to seat is for almost 5 minutes. Then I was sat at a table that still needs cleaning. Ordered the green beans and pork and the jumbo prawns wonton noodle soup. Again, food was good and portion size was decent as we had to take some food home, but service was below average, even for Asian service standard."}
{"text":"So going out for dim sum has slowly dwindled from my diet, there used to be a time when I'd be going weekly with the fam jam. What better way to break that streak than to check out T.Pot China Bistro? All my buddies in town along with my sis were raving about how good T.Pot was, which made it pretty surprising how bad their Urbanspoon rating is. Who knew the 'spoon could be wrong?!! Guess there's always a first for everything. I can only give my two cents on the dim sum but based on my visit, this place is legit. All their dim sum dishes are fresh and made to order. It even had me reminiscing about HK dim sum.  Located in Country Hills, this place is inconveniently out of the way but it's worth the drive. The strip mall area is packed with several other Asian restaurants and a T&T Supermarket. We were able to get VIP parking and did not have to wait long to be seated. We came on a Saturday but way past the brunch/lunch rush, so there was no problem finding a table.  The menu is straight forward - tick off what you want and flag down a waiter/waitress. Then wait for the goodies to come.  -Siu mai (#14) ($5.75) - siu mai came in a fancy, wooden box. A staple item that we always order and it consisted of a mixture of pork and shrimp. Yum. - Loh mai fun (#29) ($6.50) - preserved meat with sticky rice. A good filler and while it didn't have a lot of meat in it, it was tasty. - Beef and cilantro cheong fun (#23) ($5.75) - we asked for the soya sauce on the side so that my sis could eat it. Otherwise, these rice crepes are normally drenched in a pool of sauce. They were pretty good. - Har gow (#11) ($5.75) - the har gow (shrimp dumplings) were nice and plump. Another staple order that we enjoyed. - Pan fried dumplings (#13) ($6.50) - the pan fried dumplings were delectable. Juicy pork in the inside, good amount of filling and the dumplings had a nice texture/light crisp to them. - Loh bak go (#39) ($5.75) - good, not too greasy but the fried turnip cakes could have been crispier. - Thai style vegetables (#80) ($7.95) - we wanted some vegetables to eat/to combat all the meat and grease, so we decided to order their \"Thai\" style vegetables. That's in quotations because I have no clue how these are even slightly associated to Thai food. These were basically stir fried vegetables, not a hint of spice or flavours that you'd expect. Definitely pass on this. - BBQ pork bun with butter and sugar (#9) ($5.75) - these were sooooooooooooo good. Piping hot, heavenly clouds of pillowy BBQ pork bun goodness. 100% order these, your taste buds can thank me later.  T.Pot is a great spot to grab some tasty dim sum in Calgary. I will be back to try more of their dishes and of course, for their delicious buns. Bun me up!"}
{"text":"Beware travelers!!! this place is no good at all, rude staff, food was awful  Ewww is the only word that comes to mind. If you are used to American style Chinese food or dim sum this is nothing like it at all."}
{"text":"The first visit to this restaurant we sat down... Waited for a long time, looked at the menu and left. First impression was extremely authentic Chinese with no idea what to order or how to read the menu, let alone communicate with the server.   My second visit, I was prepared and came with a Chinese friend.... Haha. We had Dim Sum and she ordered everything. The food was great and the place was packed. Thank goodness for my friend otherwise I would have been lost and ordered stuff I knew nothing about.   The restaurant always seems busy, and is tailored for the Chinese community. This is not your typical Chinese fried rice and chicken balls. Price seems high but maybe it's fitting for the authenticity and type of food they serve."}
{"text":"They've gotta do something to get that ridiculous wait time under control. Didn't even get to eat here because the wait was well over an hour, what a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Given options in Calgary, this is a pretty good one for dim sum. On par with standard dimsum places in HK. Heavy msg which probably adds to the taste, but it is dimsum after all. The usual items won't disappoint and pretty good bun selection."}
{"text":"Food here is average. Big problem here is that there is no service at this restaurant. You sit down and wait 10 minutes for someone to take your order. The waitresses will then try their best to avoid customers.  Be prepared to get attitude from the waitress, If you tip these people accordingly to their miserable service. I tipped 10% due to their poor service and was treated as if I still owned them money. The waitress slammed my card on the table and looked away.   If you enjoy being treated like crap then go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. The restaurants has two sides to it. One side is Chinese dishes and the other side is HK café style. Depending what you feel like.  So came here for the HK Café side and I got the Korean Style cheese beef pot dish which came with drinks and for an extra $2 you can add chicken wings (3) or gyoza (4) to it. I like their chicken wings and gyoza. The gyoza outside has a nice and crispy bottom. The chicken wings are pan fried and has a pretty good flavor to it. I personally like it.   The Korean Cheese beef pot is not bad. I feel that its a dish made up by them and not really authentic. But Its ok. Only issue I have is that it takes a long time to eat because its super hot and comes in a really hot bowl that cooks nonstop. But anything with cheese is yummy. I like it. Not WOW that is for sure.   The drink I got was a HK style milk tea. Nothing special from what I usually get at other HK style restaurants.   Décor is not bad. Its interesting and clean. Nice chandeliers.   Overall, its not bad. Maybe one of the better HK style café in Calgary. I don't have much high expectations in terms of Chinese food here."}
{"text":"The staff are horrible!! They would shaft a group of nine into a small table but let a group of 5 sitting in a bigger table because  its friends of the lead waitress! WTF... Will never patronize this place again. There are better options in Calgary."}
{"text":"I wish I could love this place as my heart wants to...  I have an obsession with hk style cafes, and this is the closest location I can find.   Their food is okay, but selection is limited compared to cafes in china town. Service is horrid in the bistro side of the resturant, the servers often get irritated when one tries to order in english, as some of the servers have limited english.  They have good tea time deals though. So its a good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"yummm! Dim sum was yummm! very busy.   -fried salt and pepper tofu -salty fish and chicken fried rice -salt and pepper squid  the usual: - ha gow (shrimp dumpling) - sui mai (pork dumpling) - rice crepe (shrimp, beef, or plain) - BBQ pork bun   Go ... go eat now! :) haha."}
{"text":"Took a few friends here for dinner on a Sunday at 6pm. Not very busy. I've eaten here before but haven't returned in over a year or more as the service was somewhat slow and disorganized the last time.  This time, service was much better. We ordered wine, placed our order and the food began to arrive in a good succession after 15-20 minutes.   The food selection is upscale Cantonese and is amazing!  I love that they add/change  menu items to keep it fresh but still keep their regular items. Every dish was well seasoned, not overly salty ( my big pet peeve) and very fresh. See pics for what we had. You won't find any Chinese Cdn dishes and they crank up the standard Cantonese fare a few notches. This place is great for creativity in their dishes and not unreasonably priced. You get what you pay for so dishes range from $12-25. They offer a wide range of preparation (pan fry, steamed, grilled, sautéed) for your lobster/crab/ fish etc in a variety of sauces and styles too.   As for ambience, it's better than most Chinese restaurants in town but can get very loud. One side of the resto is for family dining and one side is more of a Hong Kong Cafe. They also offer dimsum but I've only eaten dinner here.  If you're seeking a new Chinese experience, a few items may be unfamiliar or possibly frightening so go with a friend if it's your first time who knows about things like pig intestines, sea cucumbers, enoki mushrooms and tofu concoctions. Don't worry, they still offer beef chow mein and spring rolls but this is not the right place for those items. Go here if you want to extend your Chinese palate!!!"}
{"text":"Dim sum in Calgary! 2 yrs. ago when we were in town we were already pretty impressed with the quality, this time around we tried this dim sum place that is also attached to a HK Style Cafe, and we are totally impressed!! As you can see all the dim sum in the photos looks totally authentic, some even I dare say is better then in Vancouver! I am glad that all these N. American cities are getting improved ethnic food and the standard keeps moving up."}
{"text":"Good food with reasonable price, the only thing I dislike is waiting time. This one is always full, so please reserve before you go. Even you have sit down already, you may also have to wait for 30-40 minutes if they are busy."}
{"text":"I have a severe nut allergy, and when I asked if they were nut free, I was told that they fry peanuts on their grills. If you have a nut allergy, do not eat here!!!! They do not advertise that they use peanuts on the grill nor do they indicate that there is a risk. On a different note, their service sucked, and it took a long time to get any answers about food issues."}
{"text":"No need to make a reservation . It won't matter in the weekend cause it's so busy. But good food and service"}
{"text":"You should come with someone who is Chinese on your first visit because T.Pot is so popular with the Chinese communities in the area that it is total chaos at all times. There is no downtime at T.Pot and for good reason.   It's not the prettiest or cleanest restaurant in Calgary but it ticks all of these boxes for a Chinese one. You get two choices of service: there is the \"catch the server as she passes by\" or \"forcefully waive her down from afar\" cafe side. Or the \"bit more calm but you still have to tell them what you need all at once\" restaurant side.   Unfortunately there are few choices better in the area, or even in Calgary, so make mental preparations for chaos and be adventurous when you visit T.Pot."}
{"text":"Summary:  - Tasty food with good portions and selections - Elegant dining atmosphere - Fair services  - Prices are slightly higher than average but fair - Excellent waiting list system - Relatively clean bathrooms  Review: Be prepared to be receive an electronic disk (and put on the wait list) if you decide to go here between 11am-3pm. However, you can actually shop around the restaurant until it tells you to go back (by beeping).  The food quality is on the higher end considering all chinese food in Calgary. Majority of the options on both ordering/dining and dim sum menu are delicious. If you're vegetarian, ask for the ordering meu because there isn't much options on the dim sum list.  Tea is free on Monday to Thursday. But if you go on other days, ordering tea would charge you at a flat amount per person (regardless of how much kettles you refill) and this can be expensive of you go with large groups.   Lastly, overall service is great and very responsive. You just need to be a little forceful to get attention from a waitress. However, it can be difficult to catch some service during rush hours (Like any other places at rush hour)."}
{"text":"We headed up north for dim sum with friends and were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  It seemed in a very suburban plaza with a very busy parking lot - mainly because it was Saturday morning and everyone was shopping at T&T.  We made reservations which was quite helpful as they were busy!  The restaurant was very clean and the decor very modern - especially for a Chinese restaurant.  Obviously the restaurant was quite loud and speaking to one another was a bit of challenge due to the loudness of the surrounding tables.  We ordered the regular dim sum items:  hargaw, siu mai, BBQ buns, rice crepes ...  all were very tasty and nicely presented.  I will admit that the prices range from $4-6 per item but you get 4 or 5 pieces which is a nice touch especially when you are with a group.  They have a new BBQ pork pun w/sugar and butter and it was to die for!  I've never tasted anything like it before!!  Also another favourite was the steamed coconut and custard cake.  Fantastic!  All in all a great dim sum place which we will return to!"}
{"text":"If you're going for dim sum and you're offended by the service, I'm going to assume you don't go for dim sum often.   There was a 3 year stretch where I ate at t pot every other weekend. The food is a little inconsistent but I still think it's some of the best dim sum in the city.   Haven't tried the dinner or lunch menu yet but I've heard good things."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO NUTS  I have eaten here a few times never realizing that they re-use the oil that was used to fry peanuts.  Their menus never mention this and it wasn't until years later when we specifically mentioned nut allergies did someone actually tell us of this practice of reusing the oil.  Also, I called once to make a reservation and they said they didn't take reservations.  We arrive and they said we needed reservations???  Communication is also a big issue here."}
{"text":"Food is good and it is always busy.  Restaurant needs a better way of managing waiting patrons than to allow them all to squeeze in the front.  At least open both doors so people can come and go.    Despite food tasting good, it is pricey and I hate how they push you out when you just finish that last piece of dim sum. There are better places to have Chinese food in this area."}
{"text":"I've been coming to T.Pot for years now. The food is always consistent, fresh, and delicious. My favourite dish from here is the tobiko and dried scallop fried rice - it's a must try if you come here.  The food may be scrumptious, but be prepared for below average service.  The waiters will not be coming to your table to see how your doing, or to give you refills. If you want something here you need to ask for it."}
{"text":"Very tasty dim sum and they have another side of the restaurant that's like  a Hong Kong cafe experience . On that side you can order dim sum and their Hong Kong lunch menu . Service is a 6/10 . But it's a Chinese restaurant and normally they never have the best service .  So recap for the pros good food, lots of variety, and it doesn't take long too make compared to other places .  For cons . Service can sometimes be rude, and the price if that's  an issue for you since it's 1.5times sometimes 2 times more expensive than the other dim sum restaurants I went to . But the price is still reasonable enough for me to go once a week with my family"}
{"text":"Darn good dim sum!  Fresh and piping hot.  I would say it's a more refined dim sum than most Chinese restaurants I've been to.  We were there at 9:15 a.m. and it was already open.  The only problem with being that early is that you can't order some other items that begin at 10 a.m. like choke (porridge).  So we lingered and got our choke order in.  The tea came and sat on a little candle burner to keep the tea hot.    We ordered: - Har Kau (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings) - crunchy little shrimp dumplings - Stu Mai (Steamed Pork and Shrimp Dumplings) - very fresh - Steamed BBQ Pork Buns with Abalone Gravy (gravy is inside) - superb! - Steamed Beef Balls - waitress came with scissors to promptly cut these balls up; comes with a side of Worcestershire sauce - Steamed Stick Rice in Lotus Leaf - delicious! - Steamed Beef tendon and Daikon - tender tendon - Shrimp Rice Crepe - great black sweet salty sauce to pour over the crepe - yum! - BBQ Pork Pastry - soft little pockets of delicious BBQ pork - Pork Liver Porridge or Congee (choke ) - bubbling with goodness and cooked to perfection.  I would say best place for cheek, ever!  - Chinese donuts - to eat with choke - came a little earlier before cheek came out at 10 a.m.  Oh well! - Sesame Balls - Great balls of fire!  These sweet balls were deep-fried and huge! - Durian Pastry - The best durian pastry now found in T-Pot!   I'd come back again!  Oh, don't forget to get condiments of chili paste and chili oil made with little dried baby shrimp.  Need these 2 kinds of chili to eat dim-sum."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 food here is phenomenal dim sum is great starts early at 9AM.  Environment 3/5 restaurant is fairly clean. Bathrooms are disgusting always smells of urine, doesn't seem like the clean it ever.   Parking 2/5 Parkin. Is terrible recommend you part at the t&t parking and walk over.  Service 1/5 staff here are very rude doesn't care if customers are waiting .  Lady at the till talks in her personal phone all the time and talks to her friends instead of helping customers in line to pay or order take out. Tells customers 25 mins and I've been here 45 mins and my food is still not ready."}
{"text":"Real upscale Dim -Sum! The ha gao are at 7$ just to give you a scale... but the difference with your average cantonese canteen is striking. Worth every penny. Perfect for lunch or breakfast before Airport flight."}
{"text":"I feel like I have stepped off a plane when I enter T-Pot. When I become a visible minority, you know this dim sum is going to be good. Now, I am not very adventurous when it comes to dim sum, no tripe or chicken feet for me, but I do enjoy nomming down steamed pork buns, taro cakes, dumplings and egg tarts. I could eat those egg tarts all day. I enjoy learning Chinese customs and have taken it to heart, always refill your elders tea first before your own cup. Use the back end of your chopsticks to grab food off of the plates and flip them around when putting food into your mouth.  The food is delicious, there is the option for plenty of service, they must have at least 50 staff working at one time, but you are definitely at a disadvantage if you don't speak the language.  Party of two or 20? The T-Pot can accommodate you, though I would suggest making a reservation. You don't want to be waiting for your table in the front entrance with 19 other guests.  Parking is crazy here which you wouldn't think would be a problem since there is a huge lot, but it is situated next to a Tim Hortons and the T & T.  Come to the T-Pot, enjoy some amazing dim sum, while taking in the atmosphere of this culture.  Review #11 of Yelp's 30 day challenge 2012"}
