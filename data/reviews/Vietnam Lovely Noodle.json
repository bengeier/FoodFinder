{"text":"I'm so happy to see a pho restaurant in the Annex - finally! Their build your own bowl is slightly (by perhaps a dollar) more expensive than places you'd find in Chinatown, but I don't mind it for the convenience. I'd stick to the pho here. Delicious broth, good portions of meat and noodles. Sometimes they forget to bring out the bean sprouts and Thai basil, but if you mention it they bring it right away. I'd stay away from their lemongrass pork dish though. I find it much more delicious at other Vietnamese places."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Annex! Taking over the old Flaming Bull location, this new dig kept the same beautiful decor - except the prices are much more affordable.   They have Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai on the menu. Everything was done well at a fantastic price point. Huge Portions!  They have a \"add your own topping\" pho section. SO loved the freedom and went crazy with a raw beef and fish ball combo. It must have been good because the humongous bowl was gone in 15 minutes! We had the Tom Yang Soup Noodle and Beef Pho.   Overall, clean and modern decor. Great service. Delicious food and gigantic portions. This would be a staple for us!"}
{"text":"I have finally found a perfect pho spot with excellent food and service. Came here on a Saturday night to get my pho fix. Was greeted and seated right away. The server was extremely friendly. The server suggested the \"famous pho\" and it sounded to good to not try. It was bomb! I definitely wanted to thank the server for the suggestion and the great service.   Service 5/5 Food 10/10  Seriously can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"New Vietnamese/S. Asian noodle place opened up recently on Bloor St. West & Dalton, kitty-corner from the FedEx store. I'm always in search of new noodle soup places to try and this is a nice welcome to the Annex.  Ordered the Penang laksa (large): the broth was flavourful but mildly spiced, chicken, rice noodle, sprouts & tofu puffs were fine. Thankfully someone had the foresight to place not just the squeeze bottle of hot sauce but also the chili paste with a layer of hot oil at the tables;  those are the best. I put 2 heaping spoons & it added the right amount of heat to my laksa.  Overall it was okay and satisfying. I've had better but definitely sated my hunger. I would certainly come back and try their other offerings."}
{"text":"I came here for take out very nice establishment...very friendly and clean i ordered fresh rolls and the lady asked if i wanted pork in them which i thought was very considerate.iwould have loved to order something else but i guess there's always next time."}
{"text":"The special noodle was disappointing, particularly the broth. I've tasted much better on Ossington. (It really consisted of a little of each of the optional ingredients - meatballs, tripe, and beef and they were nothing special). The rice dishes, however, did look good. (My partner enjoyed the \"Malaysian rice\"). I'm not sure this will last that long, rather like the Taiwanese restaurant before it."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Stars Service: 4 Stars Ambience: 4 Stars   Me and my partner were looking to grab something to eat quickly and stumbled on this restaurant. It looked alright from the outside so we gave it a try.  We ordered the vermicelli and a small Penang Laksa noodles. I was surprised when the food arrived as I was expecting very little food but what we got were fairly generous portions.  The taste was fairly good. The Laksa was not too spicy and had a nice, light curry taste. The noodles and the meat were fairly standard, no complaints. My partner really enjoyed the vermicelli as well so overall the experience was satisfying.  The staff was attentive and fairly friendly. We got our food quickly and they did check in on us and refill our drinks.  The space itself looked clean and the decor was not bad. There were about 10 tables but were spaced out and did not feel cramped at all.  Overall this place was a nice find. The prices are reasonable and the food was pretty good. I would definitely come back again if I was looking for food in the area. A fairly solid choice."}
{"text":"Had to check the door, looked closed. The last restaurant in this space didn't even last a year (too expensive, same bad design). I'm not a decorator, but, the front should be opened up. Needs to look friendlier and open from the sidewalk. Get rid of the stool area, open it up. I asked for white meat and rare beef pho.  Beef was 'ok'... Chicken was full of poor cuts.  Broth bland.  The city has great pho, this ain't it! They only have take out menus for table seating, looks cheap. I wish I could give 1.5 stars...  Couldn't see me ever returning."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto on vacation during the winter and my sister caught a cold. Decided to take hey to get some pho to help her. This was the closest place to the museum, so we decided to check it out. Theyhave a lot of options on the menu. The best option/value in my opinion is the house special pho. I believe it was 10.99 for a large bowl and you get raw beef, cooked beef, tripe, tendon, and some beef balls. I think you have the option of picking what kind of broth you want, but I assumed the house special came with beef broth since ask the meat was beef. It was my sister's first time having pho and she fell in love. I'm not too picky about pho since I know I can dress it up to my own liking."}
{"text":"Skip the pho and go straight for the Penang laksa soup which is amazing. Rich, spicy broth, chicken, egg, fried tofu, and both egg and rice noodles."}
{"text":"Seeking solace, I came in search of something warm and comforting... I ordered the small raw beef (don't panic kids, it cooks in the delectable beef broth) pho. Golden, glistening and flavourful, this made a rough day a little better. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pho broth - one of the best I've tried. We had beef pho, vermicelli( great grilled meat but the noodle was just ok) and chicken wings which was yummy.   Very family friendly. Definitely will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Me and a friend were on Bloor and looking for somewhere to get a quick warm meal. We ended up at Vietnam Lovely Noodle. We struggled a bit to communicate with them but in the end figured it out and ended up ordering soup. I got a curry base type soup and my friend got pho. I really liked my soup but it was a fairly large portion so I took it to go. A bit spicy, but full of flavour. Also lots of veggies.   They informed us when we arrived that the credit card machine is down. But by the end of our meal they seemed to have the issue resolved so we were able to pay without cash. A good experience and a nice, casual atmosphere. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Really glad that Vietnam Lovely Noodle has stuck it out in this increasingly tough zone of Bloor St., dominated by sushi places.  A nice addition to the neighbourhood. The food is good, the service is excellent, and the seating is spacious.  It's nice to have a place north of College St. where you can get a nice meal up until midnight."}
