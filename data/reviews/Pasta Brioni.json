{"text":"This is a must for authentic Italian food and atmosphere. Happy hour all day on Sunday's. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boyfriend had the chicken rigatoni. Both were excellent. The bartender Alex was great. Great service, great food, good prices and a lot of choices!!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food! Went on Christmas- great service, waiter was extra nice. All food was delicious. Great gluten free pasta too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for training and had met the owner Brian the previous evening. He implored us to come see him for lunch the following day, \"we were going to love it\". What a mistake. The food was slightly better than Olive Garden. We walked in and there was nobody to greet us, we wandered past the kitchen and asked the cook if they were open. Our server was working the place by himself, it took FOREVER for any service. There was one other table in the place beside us, and it was slooooooooooooow.Well over an hour for lunch, with four people in our party, and one other couple in the restaurant. No lunch prices, just a dinner menu, I spent 27 dollars plus tip for a bowl of pasta and a glass of iced tea. (great rolls though.) The owner never bothered to come out and say hello, or thank us for coming to his restaurant. How they have stayed in business as long as they have is beyond me."}
{"text":"This was the 1st year I didnt spend Thanksgiving at my aunts home. Retired, my aunt didnt feel like spending all day cooking. I decided to try Pasta Brioni. It was amazing! The food delicious and our server \"Stony\" was great. Thanks for making our evening such an awesome delight!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for about 17 years and I'm still a big fan.  Although it has had some ups and downs, the service and food have always been no less than above par.  Our most recent visit was one of the best I've had in the last past couple of years.  The service was prompt, attentive, and delivered with personality (Mike - great job).  We started off sharing the Beet salad, which was something I've never had before.  The presentation was unique and the flavor, ingredient ratio, and amount were very satisfying.  We ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Martini as entrees, which I think are some of the best in town without a doubt.  I was so eager to dive in that I forgot to take a picture.  We'll definitely be coming back again soon - more than once."}
{"text":"horible sauce.......doubtful if fresh tomatoes used or even canned marzanos  the sauce was a tomato paste and water  and reminded me of what poor immigants ate when they arrived off the boat at ellis island..  decor predictable and keeps in line with other bronx-like establishments..oversized portions but who cares  food is terrible  would not return to casa brioni (marinara manor)"}
{"text":"The food here rocks, the service is marginal. However, were in Az & delicious Italian is so hard to come by that I overlook the short falls. Love there vodka sauce & white pie."}
{"text":"Good italian food, but not five star. I had a huge pepperoni and lettuce salad but it was chopped really fine, not my preference. Best surprise was the sauce on the mussel appetizer, ask for more bread to soak it up. Plus the olive oil and balsamic on the table were fantastic. Huge servings."}
{"text":"this is a sad review for me. it's one of those \"what the hell happened to my favorite italian place in arizona\" realizations. 

i have been going to pasta brioni for so long now, i can't remember the first time BUT i will not forget my last time (and i am not coming back). for years we had looked forward to our brioni meal and the veal (pounded very thingwith a small salad on top - always a special they have, never on the menu). my grandparents have been regulars for years and know most of the people there. when i asked my papa if he wanted to go to brioni, he said \"let's do North instead\" - but i really wanted the veal and my sister wanted to show her boyfriend our old fav. i should have listened to papa. since the owners changed it's been a steep downward spiral.

i should have known from the get-go that this was going to be a bad experience - the host, who was nothing like the definition of his title, didn't as much look our way when supposed \"regulars\" were waiting to get to their table. he was too consumed with something else (maybe the havoc in the kitchen??). so we found our way to our table by ourselves (thanks buddy, you didn't even say hi), and sit down ready for the veal! oh guess what, the veal is only served on weekends (WTF, since when?), so i put my disappointment behind me and ordered the chicken the way they prepare the veal. when asked if the same chef was around, they said \"yes, the same guy for 12 years now,\" (i somehow don't believe that line) the beet salad i ordered was bad. the calamari was good. and now to the grand finale of the shitty brioni experience....our main courses.

my grandfather got his linguine & clams first, and when I say first, I mean 10 minutes before the rest of us and almost 20 minutes before my grandma got hers. poor poor timing in the kitchen. especially to make an older lady wait for her food, not cool. my grandfather didn't complain about his food being there (he always starts eating before any of us and never waits, we're use to it). as we all waited and waited and waited for my grandma to get her food, ours was getting cold, we began to eat ours and 10 minutes later, her's came. and guess what she got?? wait for it....wait for it....CHICKEN. damn, who knew chicken took as long as a souffl? my chicken, prepared thinly pounded with a  salad on top, was sub-par, not to brioni standards and i had to shovel the ENORMOUS salad off of the top of my chicken to another plate for about a minute until i could actually see the chicken, and there was still salad on my plate. i think they threw the whole bag of mixed greens on top. everyone had OK meals...but it was the service that killed it.

when we tried to find our waiter or possibly a manager or maybe someone who might be in charge of this mess of an operation, they were no where to be found. my grandfather got up and \"spoke\" with someone in charge and explained to him that we will never be back and thanks for the horrible service. i'm sure he was \"nice\" about it, as any disgruntled italian grandfather would be. finally our waiter came back but it was to explain to the other table next to us why their food was not coming out...and in the middle of this, the rude host came over to yell him right in front of our tables. very professional. so our waiter tells us that as a consolation prize he will buy our dessert. oh wow, thanks buddy. our dessert came and they didn't even throw in tira misu. no, just some odds and ends they have leftover it seemed like. it was horrible. 

as we left my granfather said, so everyone could hear, \"we're never coming back here.\" true dat papa."}
{"text":"Pasta Brioni was one of the first restaurants I tried out when I moved to the valley last year.  The bruschetta appetizer is a favorite and I've never been disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. My only gripe is that they don't offer Chicken Vesuvio, which happens to be one of my most favorite Italian dishes. I'd probably visit more frequently if they did. The service is really great. The waiters -- yeah, they're pretty cute -- are friendly, attentive and accomodating. Two thumbs up for Pasta Brioni!"}
{"text":"Freaking Outstanding.  Great food. Fair pricing.  Super atmosphere for old school Italian."}
{"text":"We've eaten here for years.  However, it's been a little while since the last visit.  The food has always been good, leaving me wanting more.  That was until lastnight.  Maybe it's the state of the economy causing the need to watch their costs because they seem to be cutting back on critical ingredients.  The chicken breast in the parmesana and bianco chicken entrees were pounded to a paper thin thickness.  Also, there were very few small, diced pieces of shrimp in the penne vodka shrimp entree.  This used to be served with medium-sized, whole shrimp.  Next time when Italian food sounds appetizing, this will not be on the list.  It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Great location in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. I recommend the eggplant rollatini as an appetizer and the Rigatoni four cheese for a main course. If you saved room for desert they also offer some nice homemade cakes and other sweets :)"}
{"text":"Food.....service.....wait staff and owner are fantastic! Best Italian restaurant around... and their catering is awesome!  Being Sicilian and coming from New Jersey this establishment is back east italian!
Try it once and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza online and it came early which is a plus. Pizza was good, a little heavy since it was a four cheese but can't knock it for that. Crust was great though. Plus it was big so I guess I have lunch for three days. Woohoo!! Online ordering was easy and convenient. Will order from them again!"}
{"text":"We visited Pasta Brioni for the first time (and last time) yesterday.  Unfortunately, the service was very poor.  Our food took an hour to arrive, and the excuses our waiter made for all the various delays were not very believable.  When the food arrived, it was fresh and hot and tasty, but for the prices we paid, we expected a much better experience and we will not return."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is lacking. I had called in advance to inform that I would be bringing in my mother for her 80th birthday. The person I spoke with mentioned that they would have a special table ready for her and a cake. When we arrived, we were instructed to pick our own table; no special preparations.  Had to ask multiple times for the parmesan cheese which, when finally brought out, was in a grinder that kept breaking on the waiter. At the completion of the meal that waiter asked, \"done yet\"? How about, \"ma'm are you finished yet\"?

The olive oil was rancid. 

For the price of lunch ($74 for two), will not be back."}
{"text":"This placed saved Christmas!!!  We had a reservation at Buca de Beppo.  They were so overbooked they said it would be an hour for a table and two additional hours for food. WITH a reservation.  So we called Pasta Brioni.  They rearranged things to get us in last minute, fed us a great meal with superb service, and gave us a glass of wine to compensate for the stress of the evening - that they did nothing to create and everything to solve. Yes they were a tad more pricey but SOOO worth it. Save yourself a lot of stress and just come here. Thanks Pasta Brioni."}
{"text":"I am very pleased with my experience at Pasta Brioni. Definitely on the pricey side but I was taking my girlfriend to dinner on Valentine's day so that it was a special occasion. It was evident that the staff was working in a very stressful environment with almost every seat filled but I was impressed with their professionalism and friendliness regardless. The environment was beautiful as we were seated outside (thanks to the beautiful Arizona weather). Our waiter was very friendly. He was very helpful and made pleasant conversation. Many of the staff was interactive with the people and seemed to legitimately have fun in doing their job. The food was just as amazing as the service. I got the penne vodka with chicken and a garden salad. She got the rigatoni pasta with meatballs and a Ceasar salad. AMAZING. Paid 65 including a 15 dollar tip. Overall they helped make our Valentine's day experience amazing and this business deserved all the credit in the world for their amazing food and professionalism. I am a huge fan. Thanks again Pasta Brioni!"}
{"text":"The Good - The food was very good, which, of course, is most important. 
The Bad - My biggest disappointments were, number one, all the glasses on the table for 4, both water and wine, were horribly water spotted. I've never seen such a thing in a restaurant. Number two, my husband had a soft drink and asked for a refill. He was charged for 2 soft drinks. Who charges for refills these days??  Very disappointing and petty."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for many years and it is by far the most amazing Italian food in Arizona. All the dishes are old school, traditional Italian recipes that are to die for, and the seafood is always so fresh. The desserts are ALWAYS amazing, their cheesecake is my all time favorite. My grandparents introduced me to this restaurant many, many years ago and we have never had anything but top notch service and consistently great food. Pasta Brioni is a Scottsdale staple, there simply isn't any other restaurant that could compare."}
{"text":"Booked a surprise birthday party for Friday June 10.  Worked with the Manager, Dave who actually took care of our dinner.  Timing was perfect, our guests arrived early to find the back room decorated, hors d'oeuvres which were fabulous and wine being enjoyed by the time we arrived.  From the Caesar salads to the veal chops, parmesan chicken to pasta enjoyed by all.  The guests all raved about Dave, the food and the service."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a good Italian place in the area for some time. Another couple took us to dinner at Pasta Brioni. They've been going there for years and raved about the place..

The bread served before the meal was very good and warm. Much to my liking.

Before the main meal, we ordered a caesar salad. The salad was good, but nothing exceptional. The salad was by far the least favorite part of the meal. 

The pasta and pasta sauce was very good. I went with a very basic dish of rigatoni bolganese.  The dish was very good and had lots of food. 

After filling up on bread, salad and our meal, we couldn't go for dessert, but split one. We had the chocolate ice cream in a hard shell, with hazlenut with whipped cream. The dessert was really good. I couldn't have eaten the dish by myself, but splitting it was a perfect way to end the meal with something on the sweet side.

Nice atmosphere in the dining room and bar area. The decor provided a nice ambiance to the evening. 

Service was very good! The waiter was very attentive to our needs and water was refilled in a prompt manner.

I plan on heading back there in the near future and trying other dishes.."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but it loses two stars for fact that you almost never get your entire order when you have it delivered. I'm not even talking complicated orders... a sandwich that comes with pasta salad will show up with no pasta salad more often than not."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Phoenix area from Indianapolis wanted to find a great Italian restaurant for my Mother in law's birthday.  We chose Pasta Brioni  based on the Yelp reviews.  I have to say that our party of six had one of the worst dinning experiences of our lives.  The location is incredibly difficult to find but after driving around it for 20 minutes we found it.  We had made a reservation and were seated immediately, which I thought was great considering they were pretty full.   This is where the service stopped.

We were sat without menus for 10 minutes.  Once we had menus we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to return and give us their specials.  Each time the waiter came to our table he would say a few words and then immediately turn and quickly leave, not asking if we had any questions or God forbid if we would like a drink.  A member of our party asked the man helping and serving bread and water about a menu item.  He refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter.  After reading the menu for 15 minutes our waiter returned to take our order.  He took our food order and turned and left.  I had to snap my fingers to get his attention when he was about 10 feet away from our table to get him to come back and finally take our drink order.  

Once we had our drinks we toasted to the birthday girl during which I spilled my drink.  I quickly got up and located my waiter notified him of what had happened.  He looked like a deer in headlights and asked me what we should do.  I asked for something to clean it with and was handed a few extra napkins.  

Back at the table, drink cleaned up and waiting again this time 30 minutes for our dinner.

The manager? or host?  apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly.

Once the meals arrived the food was good, not the best Italian I have ever had but by no means the worst either.  Definitely not worth the time that it took to receive it.

My rating is based solely on the terrible service we received and that we had to try and chase down our waiter to get anything done."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Very family-like restaurant.  Good take on a date restaurant or a good just sit down and eat great food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal recently at Pasta Brioni in Scottsdale, AZ. Pasta Brioni makes good on its claim to be a back east style Italian restaurant. I am from New York State, so I know whereof I speak!  Chef Mike prepared a great dinner. Everything was delicious, but the calamari was my special favorite. And do treat yourself to the homemade cheesecake. A great evening!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took some family friends who were in town from Minnesota to Pasta Brioni for dinner. It was our first time dining here and we picked it mostly for the location and reviews. The food was delicious and portions were great. I am giving this a four star rather than five only because towards the end of our dinner I was parched and looking for our waiter for water refills, and the menu is a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I have never written a Yelp review before.  But, after a recent trip to Pasta Brioni, I found myself inspired to write my first.  This has nothing to do with the pasta, which was mediocre at best.  This has to do with the absolutely abysmal service we recieved.

We were completely ingored for the majority of our meal.  At one point I had to go to the bar and ask our server, who was engaged in a lengthy conversation with a female patron, for a Coke refill.  When he came do the table he slammed our drinks down and left without a word.  Clearly, he was to busy flirting to be bothered with work at work.

I can safely say that I will not be returning to this place.  I prefer my pasta without the uppity Scottsdale attitude."}
{"text":"Pasta Brioni is one of our favorite restaurants in old town Scottsdale. It is a pleasure to see a restaurant where the owner is a visible presence! We had the veal, Caesar salad, calamari, and everything was awesome.  We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Went with a groupon - would never have though of going otherwise.  I am glad I did though. Food was spectacular.  I had penne pasta from the special menu, with some kind of vodka sauce, peas, ham, cheese - it sounds boring but it was awesome.  My partner had veal marsala - again awesome.  We will be back - it is pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"Pasta was gummy..french bread is heavy.. nor do I say more"}
{"text":"Place is very cozy. Great place to ear and. Ring family. Food was serve fast and fresh. The serving are huge. With one sandwich two can eat. There are different settings you can eat: indoors, outdoors, or set up for private parties"}
{"text":"Continues to be a 5 STAR dining experience!  Busiest time of the year, Car Auction, Horse Show, TPC . . But DAVID, Owner/Partner in charge of the dining room, had it running smoothly as always last night!  COME HERE ONLY if you want great Italian food, a warm, intimate room, relaxed and non-pretentious staff, but most of all, GREAT ITALIAN FOOD ( . . . sorry, but we love this place.  We've been coming here for years)!  The menu is awesome, so many wonderful dishes, top quality (tonight we had Sea Bass, Shrimp and Shiitake Mushroom pasta, and I had an incredible Chicken, vegetable, penne pasta dish (wow, only 650 calories, couldn't believe it) and they were all fantastic as always.  Love you Past Brioni, don't change a thing . . . see you again soon!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Scottsdale after a long drive from Santa Fe. We were hungry!  Sadly we forgot about the time change and showed up for dinner early!  

It was not a problem, despite the fact the chef was doing prep (loudly) in the kitchen we were welcomed and given a table.  I know they weren't ready for prime time but they didn't bat an eye. We ordered and food arrived.

The food was delicious. I had the salmon on a bed of spinach with capers and risotto. It was garlicky delicious!  Hubby had the same thing he always orders, Chicken Parmesan. It disappeared.

We were full but the waiter suggested some \"home made dessert.\"  We chuckled and asked who's home? He said the Chefs wife does the desserts, then named off the offerings. We had to have (shared mine you) the cheesecake. It was a perfect finish to our meal.

Thank you all for making our first meal in Scottsdale a memorable one!

Now if someone would just turn down the furnace....Phoenix in July? Oh my!"}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars because the food was pretty fantastic but...read on. Great place to sit at the bar for late night happy hour!  Bartender was super friendly and service was good. We ordered a ton of food and had quite a bit in front of us. A closed bottle of olive oil fell over the front of the bar.  A greasy rude dude that worked there picked it up and made some comment about how EXPENSIVE it was and how that was the last bottle until the delivery tomo. Really!!! An italian restaurant and I potentially spilled the last bottle of Olive oil in the entire place and may have put them line down for the night....Keep up the customer service buddy!"}
{"text":"Attentive wait staff and quick service. I love that whole wheat pasta can be substituted on request. The Capelini Primavera is fresh, and the serving is quite generous. You definitely get what you pay for here. Can't believe I didn't try this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Two couples, four different dishes and no complaints.  The food was great and so was the service.  

I can't believe this restaurant is a stone's throw away from an Arby's."}
{"text":"My Favorite Italian Restaurant tucked away in Old Scottsdale.  Vodka Penne with Shrimp and a touch of spice is my fav!  Desserts are old school homemade recipes and the cheesecake and tiramisu are the best I've had in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"First time dining there. Great service and food was great as well. Wife had chicken Gorgonzola and I had lasagna. Both were great. Good wine list and price was good for quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best vodka sauce in town.  Service can be a little slow during the day."}
{"text":"It's not been as good of late and that's sad. It was always my go-to-place with friends and family visiting. I hope they can get back to where they used to be"}
{"text":"For a place that serves delicious food (I'd give the food 4 stars) it boggles my mind on how poor their customer service and communication is.  The communication/customer service is 1 star.

The people answering the phone do not want to be working there.  Have fun repeating your phone number and address multiple times because they aren't paying attention and really don't care.   I called last week and a girl answered the phone who sounded like she was on sleeping pills.   When I politely asked to place a delivery order she hands the phone over to someone else, doesn't mute it and says \"help this guy would ya?\"    The website slow and is not updated.  They have removed items from the menu but they are still listed.  

This place could seriously knock it out of the park with some simple personnel changes."}
{"text":"There's a saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\" and it is a good saying! The sign isn't the best, but trust me, you need to stop your car and go here STAT! 

We walked in and it just smelled amazing- that's a good start in my book! We were greeted by a friendly server and given fresh bread (made in house). The bread was phenomenal and soft. It went great with some balsamic, spices and oil dipping sauce.

We chose the calamari as an appetizer and two pasta dishes that were equally as delicious and fresh as the bread. I could've kicked myself for not coming here sooner! This place is a gem! The pasta dishes were roughly $18 each and the appetizer was $10, if I remember correctly. Perfectly priced for the large quantity and fresh quality. 

One of the best parts of the restaurant is that it truly was a gem. It was definitely a place of the locals and not touristy and it was a great vibe for a week night date. The ambiance was lovely and the kitchen, while open, was pretty much quiet. 

What a beautiful little restaurant! Thank you for a wonderful evening, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat their penne alla vodka with shrimp. Been eating it for YEARS and I've yet to find better. Promise!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a friends recommendation, phenomenal service, food and atmosphere. The chef came to our table several times as did the staff, the staff made us so welcome, like family. The chefs wife is The pasty chef and the desserts are out of this world. If in Scottsdale it is a must, will be back. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. We were feeling like good authentic Italian food, & they did not disappoint! This place was a home run! 
 I'm very picky with my pizza dough/crust it was amazing!! Their prices were fair. 
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Back for the first time in 16 years. Only thing I'm trying to figure out is why it took me so long to go back!! I ordered a special dish that they had just added to the menu, Penne Milano. Incredible. We had the homemade cheesecake which was the best I can remember in a very long time. The place has been updated and the ambience was great. I know it won't be 16 years before the next visit!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service! I simply do not understand why this place isn't packed all the time. The food is delicious and the service is superb! We eat out often and good Italian food is hard to find in Scottsdale but this is certainly the best."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the very first time with my family last night to celebrate a triple birthday. Our waiter was excellent- friendly, interactive and funny. Everyone at the table tried a drink they liked, myself- several bellini's were taken down. Delicious!! Ordered mussels for my appetizer and they gave a great sized portion- enough to share with the table and all were open and able to be eaten. The pasta alla vodka was incredible. The portion size was huge and I definitely have a bunch left over for lunch. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Never again. 

We made reservations for 5:45 on a Saturday night, definitely did not need a reservation though, the place was dead. We were told to sit wherever we wanted, we chose a booth in the lounge. The decor was nice, pretty typical for a small Italian restaurant.

The service was awkward but I think the server was new, he didn't mess anything up, he just did odd things. Like he took our order and had to come back again because he forgot what my boyfriend had ordered. After our meals were delivered (by someone else) our server came by and said \"once your pasta arrives, do you want cheese? OH! It's already here! I'm blind!\". We chose to laugh about the slightly bizarre service, we have both been the new kid before too. 

I liked the rolls that came before dinner but the oil/vinegar bottles were both leaky so made a mess of our hands and the table.

I had the balsamic chicken, I really liked that this restaurant offers an under 650 calorie menu, as I wasn't starving and not really in the mood for pasta it was a good choice. I thought it had a good flavor and I enjoyed what I ate of it, I wasn't super hungry and had already had a lot of bread. 

My boyfriend had pesto chicken pasta, I noticed him doing something strange during the meal,  he kept taking a bite of his meal and then pulling pieces of chicken out of his mouth and putting it on the bread plate. I asked him what was wrong and he said \"I don't know, it's like cartilage or something, it's just...not good\". He did finish the dish though (except for the ever growing pile of chewed chicken on the bread plate). 

We left and agreed that we wouldn't be back.

Unfortunately, the reason for this place doesn't even deserve the 1-star, midnight found us both on the bathroom floor. Him, projectile vomiting from a textbook case of food poisoning and me playing nurse. Great way to end our Saturday date night."}
{"text":"I just ordered food to go from here.  The food arrived hot and in large quantities. Everything \"looked\" delicious.  That's where things started to go wrong. When I opened the container with my Penne Vodka I noticed an odd smell, like a chemical smell.  But I brushed it off and we sat down to eat. Both me and my boyfriend found the food to be inedible. He ordered the Penne Alfredo.  We could not seem to identify the offending taste except that it seemed fishy or like a chemical of some kind.  That got me thinking that it's probably the Togo containers they are using are emitting some chemical when very hot food is placed in them. We spent over 40 and we had to throw it in the trash. We will come in and give it one more shot but without the Togo containers mucking it all up.  Like I said they gave big portions and we were excited to eat it bc it looked great so they still get 3 stars for that."}
{"text":"They wouldn't let me get soup to go... They claimed to be \"busy\" and at \"capacity\". Made no sense no one was in there and how hard is it to pour soup into a cup and take my money. I dont know why I was denied... The manager was not helpful just being lazy, you manage what happens  make a first time customer happy 
1 star Good Job on not selling food from your restaurant 
Never going back worst service"}
{"text":"Went to Pasta Brioni on a recommendation from the concierge at Talking Stick Resort and Casino.  We had a great experience here.  We sat out on the patio after being immediately greeted and welcomed and given a choice of sitting in the restaurant or outside.  There is a nice mix of bar seating, dining room and patio.  We went on a Wednesday night in March so it wasn't overly busy.  The patio was nice and cozy and had good furniture and heat lamps incase.  

The waiter we had was named Stallone.  He was great.  Very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were long lost customers he hadn't seen in ages.  We also met the restaurant owner Dave who was great.  There was a medical incident in the restaurant while we were there and the staff handled the first responders and customer with attentiveness, class and dignity.  We mentioned to Dave that we heard the cannoli was recommended but overpriced according to some other Yelp reviews so he brought us one on the house.

Dish portions were large and we couldn't finish what we had ordered.  Great night.  One star was lost because of the location.  Plaza is a bit sketchy looking and not in the most vibrant part of Scottsdale although it's been in that location for 20+ years which means they are doing something right"}
{"text":"Took friends from Chicago to dine last night. Our waiter Michael just happened to be from the same neighborhood as my friends. Instant bonds were made. We had a great time, food was excellent and Michael was just perfect as our server. All the other waiters that stopped by our table for water bread etc were just as friendly. The place has a great family feel to it and without pressure to dine and leave. Will go back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"What an evening we had! This is the real deal. Ambiance. Food. Wine. Service. Four of us. Started in the bar for a glass of wine and hors d'oeuvres at happy hour. Bartender was great. She was attentive but never hovered. Moved into the diningroom for dinner. The ambiance was old school, white tablecloths, dark wood and leather. It felt cozy and classy. We thought perhaps a Soprano or two might show up!! Could this really be in a strip mall instead of NYC or SF? Two of us ordered the same dish. Two of us different dishes. We were all thrilled with rich flavors and portions. Our waiter was service at its best. He recited multiple dinner specials without a hitch, listened to us, engaged us, charmed us and was set on making this our best memory. He went over and above to fulfill a request for dessert. 
FINALLY the Italian restaurant we have searched the valley to find....we want to tell the world AND we want to keep it to ourselves....but that would really be selfish!
Wonderful place to go with friends and share a memorable evening.....ambiance. food. wine. SERVICE. Go! (Probably great grown up date night, too. You can hear one another!!)"}
{"text":"So I've ordered delivery from pasta Brioni before because their penne vodka never disappoints. But last night my boyfriend and I wanted to do a low key date night and I was craving Italian that wasn't going to break the bank. I think I can speak for both of us when I say we made a great choice in choosing Pasta Brioni. 

We ate on the lounge side which is very casual and low key. the vibe is like an old school Italian place- Sinatra playing and all. The food, as I expected, was delicious, but more importantly the service was top notch. Our server Brian was really awesome! Prompt, friendly and funny. 

I'm honestly surprised that anyone would give this place less than 5 stars.... But oh well, more pasta for me because we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery. 20 min sooner. Good food. Large portion for kids butter pasta. Good cheese pizza. We were happy! Thanks!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place in Arizona, its a cozy atmosphere, terrific food and old school feel to it.  A great dinner spot for date night!"}
{"text":"Food and portions were excellent.  Staff was very friendly.  We ate at the cafe side of the restaurant. They put together a few different dishes along with a salad that satisfied all our cravings.  The chicken with eggplant and promiscuitto (sp) in a wine sauce was awesome. We would eat there again the next time we're in Phx."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very cute. And very trendy. The service was great. Water was full at all times. The bread rolls are amazing. The food is exquisite. I had the chicken pesto and it was so creamy and full of flavor. I came here with girls and I would recommend this place for date night. They dim the lights after 8 pm and its just a very cozy feel. I will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Haven't gone in few years and decided to try. Wedge had wilted lettuce, tasteless tomato and the blue cheese had zero flavor. Then the  veal
Chop. Served with frozen spinach, tasteless mushrooms drenched in butter and the chop itself was bland and blah. The ciopini was blah. Overall not good at all. Too bad, used to be great. what came first, no business or crap ingredients and no chef? Surprised it's still in business."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this place forever, I thought is was just ok.  I found the space to be dingy rather than quaint or casual.  The staff was friendly and attentive. They offered a nice selection of Italian wines at a reasonable mark-up.  My two dining companions seemed to enjoy their dinner so maybe I just picked the wrong entree (penne vodka).  The sauce was average but the pasta was totally mushy and gross - a serious offense in any true Italian kitchen.  I'm willing to give it another try based on all the positive reviews but would probably opt for one of the meat entrees next time."}
{"text":"Where to start, let's just saw Awful!!!!!  Service was ok, waiter was pleasant.  Ordered the angel hair with chicken, it showed up almost 10 minutes after every one else was served, and when it did, the pasta was almost RAW... How do you screw up angel pasta, well they did.  Another in our party had the eggplant parm.  They should call it no eggplant pram...barely any eggplant...overall, ever rated, over priced, and just not very good...."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food was less then mediocre at best.  We both ordered their cheese ravioli and after the first bite we both determined that it had been cooked in the same water that had had some type of seadfood cooked in it.  The taste of shellfish was very evident.  Also, their bruschetta was not good at all. I would not recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nasty calzonetti, undercooked dough and icky burn marks on the dough made for a terrible meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place! I've become a regular. Happy hour is amazing, the portions are full size! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my favs are fried ravioli, penne vodka, caprese salad, and eggplant dish. Give it a shot especially if you love Italian food!"}
{"text":"Awesomesauce. No seriously, they have awesome sauce. The food is amazing.  I didn't give a 5 star review cause the Calamari was meh and as an Italian restaurant I expect good calamari.  Other than that, the service was top notch, the food was amazing and in large portions and overall great, old school mom and pop Italian restaurant. 

I got the 4 cheese Rigatoni with grilled chicken and the bf got The Chicken Parm and it was superb. Pasta done al dente just right and the grated Parm at the table, you know its authentic Italian. Good stuff all around and priced right."}
{"text":"Another perfect experience at Pasta Brioni!  The staff is amazing , the food far exceeds my expectations every time we go there.  It's a quiet place that sometime I think people just don't know about but if you don't, you are missing out.  Best Italian in Arizona! Actually, maybe anywhere!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  The food is outrageously good, the portions are generous, and the waiters are polite, helpful and classy.  The eggplant parmesan is incredible, but it's hard to make it past the daily specials, they always sound so delicious!  I've been 3 times for special occasions but I've only ordered off the menu once.  A bit spendy, but worth it for a special night :)"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is lacking and they somehow manage to f*ck up every delivery as of late, which is why I haven't ordered from them as much as I used to. Great for dining in, but not sure I would recommend the delivery unless you don't mind eating something you didn't order or getting stuck having to go to the store to get your own damn beverages, I mean, how difficult is it to check the order before you leave with it?!?! -_-"}
{"text":"Service was great, nice atmosphere... my chicken chunky Cacciatore (from the\"Lighter\" menu) was a bit bland. My companion's lasagna looked good but a little overdone around the edges. The Roasted Pepper appetizer plate was fantastic. Easy Parking, friendly,  attentive staff... I'd go back."}
{"text":"I felt like I was \"back home\" in a Boston Italian restaurant.  I let our waiter know that we had never been there and hoped to be impressed since we have our \"favorite\" italian restaurants but were here on a recommendation.  Their specials all sounded fabulous. I had the gnocchi with spinach and tomatoes - yum.  We all loved the food.  Most of all, this restaurant truly puts the emphasis on service.  The staff was all attentive and it showed."}
{"text":"Just about everything here is top notch. Grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite, but have amazing pasta dishes, salads, numerous tasty sandwiches hot and cold. Even the pizza is among my favorites in town. 

They have a small patio that is not very inviting, and the restaurant is very old and somewhat run down. That's the only reason that I didn't give five stars. Though it's old, it's clean."}
{"text":"i don't know why i have no problem going into bars alone in non-english speaking developing countries and fucking shit up but in my own country i feel like a total twat doing it. some of my most memorable travel experiences started with me alone in a bar with a book- dancing on tables with randoms i met in ljublijana, clubbing with the croatian water polo team in dubrovnik, midnight motorcycle rides with cambodian teens in siem reap.

so what the fuck is wrong with me that i had to talk myself into going to a bar alone in scottsdale?? yes, true, i am in a red state and on many levels that scares the shit out of me. i just don't know. yes, i brought my computer to do some work, and i sat at the bar, but i was consciously self-conscious. maybe this is a sign of aging. i don't like it.

i do like pasta brioni. it is walking distance from the mother's house, and i think the happy hour aint bad. i had  a huge glass of wine, raviolis and a single yet potent meatball. the total? 10.80.  is it the best italian food i've had. not even close, but it's filling, not bad and as there are others eating solo at the bar, i felt less lame.

given, the others at the bar were mostly above 65. it kinda made me feel happy that women live longer than men, so when im that age most of my friends' husbands may be dead (knocks on wood) so that at least i can go with my aged pussy posse years from now."}
{"text":"Thank you for such a memorable night for our friends birthday! Charles and CJ were amazing and catered to all our needs!  The food was fabulous (The salmon and eggplant is to die for) and we were all treated with the utmost respect despite being a difficult crew. A special thank you to Charles for even assisting us in taking the birthday girl to our car following dinner; she had a little too much fun prior to our wonderful experience at Pasta Brioni!   Looking forward to going back soon! A+++++++"}
{"text":"The chicken parmesan sandwich continues to top the charts. It is really the undefeated champion in this category. The sandwich is always loaded with the best tasting cutlets, sauce and just enough cheese to keep me happy. At about 10 bucks, based on the size, you should be able to eat one half only for lunch and save the rest. Unfortunately, I have only been able to accomplish that feat once due to not being able to stop eating the addictive food. The pasta salad also makes a nice side dish with it's creamy taste. Great lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and when it is cooler we will definitely be back to sit on the patio we walked by! We had a bunch of ladies meet up that have never been here before. We each tried a different dish while sharing a bottle of Barbara red wine. Dishes we ordered were a Cesar salad, bolonese, linguine pescatore, penne vodka---all great Italian food!  Deserts were homemade cheesecake, flour less cake and tiramisu that we ordered. Sitting in the bar area at a table was great atmosphere for our ladies laughing and telling stories. The chef stopped by our table and even stayed to chat with us. We had a great time and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I get their rigatoni in marinara sauce, its delicious! Plus their nice warm breads that they bring out to start with are sooooo good! They have these different flavored butters that make them even better! Plus they waiters are all super friendly and very familiar with the menus. During lunch hour they stay on time and I'm always to get in and get out if I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"My gfs and I went for happy hour.  You have to sit at the bar to get the discount pricing.   They pour large bottles of wine and pizza was tasty.. Looking forward to trying their pastas next!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the food especially the meatballs and pizza but until today I have been reluctant to go more often because the bread is so important to me and theirs had been heavy and too dry for me. Today it was totally different and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. So good. Can't believe I hadn't eaten here sooner. The flourless chocolate cake was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Awesome patio. The Vodka Penne was amazing too."}
{"text":"I decided to try the penne vodka. Since everybody's comment seemed positive about it. 
I live 2 min form this restaurant so I got it delivered to my house. 
Well, how to say it? It has to be the worse pasta I've ever had. So much cream I couldn't even find the pasta in the plate, there is no flavor whatsoever. I felt like the opened a can of tomato sauce, added some cream and pepper to eat and bye bye. 
Seriously guys.!!

Same for the bread, It was plain and not so good. 
I know some of you might think that because it got delivered, this is the reason why it was bad. But no, everything was very hot when it got here. 
The only good thing was the can of coke!"}
{"text":"We were encouraged to try this restaurant by friends who had been to a birthday party here. We were mostly impressed. 
We had good service from arrival to departure. I think we were the only customers when we arrived at 1:25.  
The wine list was a disappointment.  My wife was planning on a bottle of an interesting Italian white wine but there was little to choose from.   The red wines offered more but the list was not extensive.  There are a lot of American wines
Two of us had spaghetti and meatballs. It was a good choice. The portion was very large and tasty. I have had sauce I liked better but that is a matter of preference. My wife had pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was meaty and rich and dotted with chunks of fresh mozzarella. Other friend had a chicken sandwich and was happy.  Wife and I  split a portion of flourless Chocolate cake. It was good. Friends split a pumpkin cheesecake and liked it. 
This is not an inexpensive lunch but the prices were not unreasonably high."}
{"text":"Pro tip: eat in the lounge the service is better and it's much more relaxed of an atmosphere. Also, they have TVs for all the sports games. 

The bread here is so good you will end up eating multiple loaves. 

I had the rigitoni with vodka sauce and added chicken. It was so delicious. I was stuffed half way through eating it but because it was so good I ate the entire thing. Highly recommend this dish. 

Overall good food at really reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner with fantastic service at Pasta Brioni last night! It has been in the Valley FOREVER and most often my family gets takeout but I have to say, dining in is a super fab experience. 

They bring you warm, doughy rolls to start that are absolutely delicious. The best part, they have EVOO + Balsamic on the tables so that you can dip your bread! {my guilty pleasure} We split a bottle of delicious Chianti and then for my meal, I ordered a garden salad with their homemade Italian dressing {so yum!} and the piccata but subbed chicken for veal. It was SO tasty. I got it with a side of spaghetti that was just pretty average, I thought the noodles were a tad overdone but that is my only sorta complaint. All in all, I left SO full and ready for bed! Did someone say food coma? 

I would totally recommend Pasta Brioni for a family dinner, birthday, catering, you name it! They are also known for their cute Italian servers! ;)"}
{"text":"Was delicious!! Had the chicken parm and the penne with vodka sauce! The homemade rolls and rosemary honey butter is LIFE!!!"}
{"text":"Today the food fell a little short of expectations, I ordered the nightly special which was lobster and shrimp risotto.  The lobster tails were smaller than a typical tail, not a small portion as the dish came with two tails and two shrimp plus the risotto  The reason I mentioned the tail size is it might be a variety I have not had before, the lobster had a great grilled taste but had a texture that was not what was expected , not the buttery softness I associate with lobster (overcooked?). The risotto was cooked to the right consistency but could have used more butter and cream (or what it is they use to make risotto delicious)  I'm guessing the chef didn't taste this batch before it went out.  The staff was great, our server was Jason or Thomas. 4 stars based on years of patronage and have always experienced excellent service and quality food with today's exception on the food missing the mark.."}
{"text":"This place is a nice dining atmosphere for small groups and couples.  It's not pretentious or loud like many of Scottsdale's trendy restaurants.  It has a tried and true/ old family establishment feel.  The service is top notch. Our waiter was funny, polite, attentive, knowledgeable, and has pride in his work.

Most importantly, the food is worth coming back for.  As stated in other reviews the spaghetti and meatballs is really good:  The red sauce is awesome, the pasta is cooked perfectly, and the meatballs are seasoned nicely...moist with a good consistency and taste.  My husband's vodka penna with chicken was also good.  It didn't have quite the kick he wanted but he would order it again.  

Good wine list.  Tempting desert menu.  Prices are a good deal.

This was our First visit but it won't be our last."}
{"text":"Our introduction to Pasta Brioni was lackluster. I had heard great things about the food from friends and finally decided to try it for my birthday. We arrived a little after 8 pm on a weeknight and immediately felt like we were intruding. They weren't closing for another hour yet the reception was cold. We sat alone in the main lounge, which was fine. Our waiter was very matter-of-fact and didn't make any attempt at chitchat; again the cold shoulder. The food was tasty and the portions ample but not worth the price, in my opinion.  There's other Italian restaurants I'll try first before coming back."}
{"text":"The BEST Italian food I've ever had. Fantastic service. The entire staff made our dining experience exceptional. I would give them six stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great place, way bigger than it looks because of all the separate rooms. A nice lounge/bar area is vibrant to the left of the entrance.

The bread service is awesome - scratch made rolls with a hint of parm and garlic. They were heavy in a good way - a cross between a lighter pretzel roll and either a popover or a brioche roll or maybe 1/3 the way between all three!

The eggplant rolatini appetizer can easily be a light entree - with plain noodles it would be a full meal! The ricotta filling was fluffy, light, creamy AND flavorful. So good!

The vitello sorrentino was amazing! Tender veal medallions dusted in flour and pan fried with a wine butter sauce.

Service was excellent by Leah. 

They also offer pizzas and calzones mostly at lunch and we would like to try those on our next visit."}
{"text":"Most ridiculous happy hour ever! This restaurant has a bar side & a dining room side.  There are stools at the bar & some booths on bar side.  We arrived for happy hour & all stools were taken so we sat in a booth in the bar. Waiter told us that the happy hour prices were only good AT the bar.  We said But we are IN the bar!  He said sorry.  33% HIGHER price for drinks AND food  3 feet from the bar.  IDIOTIC!  We went to Roaring Fork, nicer place, pub tables, lower prices for drinks & food at their happy hour.  They lost us as customers & we live in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Being from Europe I tend to be avoid \"Italian\" restaurants in the US that lay the fake Italian on you thick. This wasn't the case for Pasta Brioni. I've been avoiding going because I tend to trust Yelpers but I was honestly pleasantly surprised. I went for a friends birthday and there were three of us. I tend to stay away from \"suggestions\" or \"specials\" bu the waiter did a great job of going over them and not being pushy. To start with the negatives, I'd say that my restaurant experiences (French,Italian or otherwise at least in Europe) begin with a few rolls of bread in a basket at your table and some butter (or olive oil). They weren't far off providing one roll and your customary olive oil but with a twist in that the bottle had an opening for balsamic vinegar which made for a great blend. I had the spinach and ricotta dumplings and the waiter was kind enough to suggest having it served with the vodka cream sauce. A great choice. My two friends had the capellini primavera (which I helped finish and it was delicious) and the chicken picatta (which I did not taste but looked equally good). All that capped with a bottle of Chianit and it was a great start to our Saturday night.
I'd probably recommend it for a date or with family  or a large group but definitely not for parents with young children as it wasn't necessarily the most casual place to dine."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Brioni's for years.  Since I moved out of the area I have not been here in a long time.  On my birthday a large group of us were planning on going out to dinner but did not decide on a place until the last minute.  Of course they could not take a party of 8... what was I thinking.  Anyway we came to the decision of Pasta Brioni so I gave them a call and they were very accommodating.  Within 15 minutes of getting there we were sat.  Our server was great and very knowledgeable.  The food was as good as I remember.  I will always be a customer of Pasta Brioni."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in the Phx area I try to go to Pasta Briones as it is my favorite restaurant! 

 They have done some remodeling and the place is brighter and more welcoming! 

 The food was fabulous as always!  Warm rolls with rosemary butter to start and a fine glass of wine! I  had a beet salad that was wonderful and presented beautifully  as a tower!  Portions are generous and delicious!   I enjoyed the spicy sausage pasta!  

This company pays attention to detail with fine glassware and even their logo on the plates!

I am sorry that I didn't have room for dessert as the cheesecake and the flourless chocolate cake are to die for! 

I look forward to coming back the next time I'm in town! If you are in the area I highly recommend Pasta Briones!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated Pasta Brioni has the feel of a New York City Italian Restaurant.  All the waiters here are young, hot, hunks who even have there own calender.  Come here for the delicious Italian dishes and I am not sure if I am talking about the food or the waiters!"}
{"text":"Some friends recommended Pasta Brioni, and then we got a coupon, so we decided why not. 2 large pizzas for $16.99, we added 2 toppings, delivered hot in less than 30 minutes. To our surprise the pizza was amazing! Total with delivery $21.69, great deal, very good pizza! 

Yes, we recommend and we'll be getting delivery again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been meaning to try this restaurant and tonight was the night. We arrived at 7:16p and the restaurant was steady but not what we would call busy. The hostess greeted us and immediately sat us at a table in the dining room, sigh...no room on the patio....  Once we were seated our server came over and was nice but just not what we expected. We ordered the fried ravioli and it was fantastic!!  Then we decided to split the pasta, there's an up charge of $4, not a big deal. After approximately 10 minutes the manager brought out our food. Here's where things go downhill. He set down the bowl, looked at us, took two bread plates from an unused table and left! Would have been nice to have a spoon, other than the teaspoon, to serve the pasta, and a bigger plate. Water never filled, we were asked if we wanted more but this was after we were finished eating. Only one bread plate, so I used the butter plate for my dinner roll (roll was ah-mazing!!!). We spoke with the manager who simply stated, \"I guess I should have charged you the $4.\"  If that means we get two bowls and a serving spoon, then I say, please charge us!!!  Not sure we will be back. Oh, one last thing, bus boy said, \"hey guys can I take this?\"  Good lord, lose the tablecloth, cloth napkins, light on table, reduce prices, and then we will be okay with this service. Not sure we will back. Too many options in our neighborhood to deal with this type of service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Service is always great, especially with Mikey the Don. Everything is amazing here. We catered for our employee recognition event and everyone LOVED it. And their cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"We ended up here one night after grocery shopping, and craving Italian food (my partner is full blooded Italian -- Olive Garden just doesn't cut it).

The prices? Quite a bit higher than we had expected, but we were hungry, so we ate.

The eggplant rollatini was to die for.  My partner said it was almost as good as her grandmother's, and that is saying A LOT. We decided to split the pumpkin ravioli, and although the addition of fresh corn was a little odd, it was really delicious, and one plate was the perfect portion for two; better yet, they split it for us in the kitchen, making it easier.

The servers were quick about our iced tea refills, and one of them chatted up my partner as they were both from New York.

I'm giving 4 stars (instead of 5) for the price being a bit high, and the oddness of having sports play while eating $14 ravioli."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I will ever go back. Went to Pasta Brioni with my mom on Friday and after we were seated our server came over and said, \"Well let's get this show on the road.\" I guess the restaurant was expecting a large party so they didn't want to work before the party arrived. Our server brought us menus finally after he brought two waters and a basket of bread and we were told they only served pizza in the To Go room of the restaurant. I asked the server if we should take our waters over and he said \"Nahhhhhh\" so I left them there, fully expecting we would be offered water in the separate part of the restaurant. I was wrong. Needless to say I had to ask for plates for our pizza, we were going to dine in but found out they were expecting a large party in that room as well. Right as they were about to bring our pizza and pasta (spaghetti with mushrooms/very little sausage for  $13) we asked if they would just box our food up to go and we left. Bad timing. Mediocre pasta. Decent pizza. But I certainly won't rush back. $30 for poor service, no thank you."}
{"text":"What a great find! Our sever took our drink orders and handed us our menues. He did not get down on one knee. He did not suggest that we start with a delicious appetizer. He did come back promptly with our drinks, ask if we would like a few more minutes and if we had any questions. How refreshing, no pushing special appetizers, drinks, or dishes. Good, old fashioned sevice. We made our choices, placed our orders, and enjoyed our meals. Good food, good prices, good service. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was definitely the right choice to bring your family for a special occassion.   Best food ive had in a very long time"}
{"text":"while i cant speak about the looks of the men working there... I do think they only hire people from New York or Jersey... the servers have the all the attitude that you would expect out of a Sopranos episode...  the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in the Bronx despite being in a strip mall...

But by far the best thing this place has to offer is the food.  while the menu is not too large and surprisingly does not have alot of Italian dishes most things they will make for you... for example last time i was there they made chicken parmesan... i would go out on a limb and say that if it is not on the menu they will probably make it for you... especially if you are a female!  

this is tops in the valley for the real deal itilano place that makes you feel like you are on the east coast"}
{"text":"We wanted to find some good Italian food and saw the high rating and rave reviews on Yelp so figured this was a good bet.  We were right.  The place has that old school Italian feel and has a very family feel in the staff.  The visit to our table by one of the owners whom I think started out as a delivery boy? Kitchen help?  Not sure where he started but now as a co-owner he's a symbol of that family business type of venue.  

The portions are big and the food is well made and the prices are very good.  The only downside was locating it.  When you're not familiar with the area it's not clear on Google Maps that it's not a stand alone place with roadside visibility.  It's in a shopping center like parking lot and you cannot see it from the street.  We drove by a couple of times before figuring that out - just glad we didn't give up and miss out on the great meal!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY, THE MOST GOD AWFUL, HORRID FOOD I HAVE EVER TASTED......wife ordered the egg plant parmesan....came with an inch on stinky cheese, after digging into it, came across a small piece of eggplant..had to send it back only to receive it with more s=cheese.  UGH.  Ordered the veal picatta, it was undercooked, the pasta with it was awful and swimming in tomato sauce.  Upon exiting, i looked into the kitchen, found a bunch of cooks with dirty t shirts.  They were not wearing any hair hats and it was not sanitary.  I also saw many empty large tomato cans...come on, the prices charged at this restaurant are worth a kings ransom and they can't afford to serve fresh tomatoes?  The waiter kept addressing everyone DEAR this Dear that, hey go easy guy, you are just a waiter and not my long lost relative.ABSOLUTELY THE WORST ITLAIN RESTAURANT THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.  Stay away from this place"}
{"text":"What I love about Pasta Brioni is the the fast-casual option on the east side of the building. On that side of the restaurant you can get high quality food without the frills of a nice Italian restaurant (which you get with the main restaurant).

I really love the vodka penne pasta, their vodka sauce is absolutely great. The cheese garlic bread is also very good. They also make a really good NY style pizza.

If you're looking for a quick option, with great food come here and go to the to-go side. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Back at Pasta Brioni for another incredible meal.  The new owner has made a lot of improvements, had a prime ribeye which melted in my mouth. We were running errands in Scottsdale and showed up without a reservation...MISTAKE!  The restaurant was packed and we were lucky to get a table...next time I'll call first."}
{"text":"A huge group of us (we filled about 8 tables) were visiting Phoenix and our hosts recommended Pasta Brioni.  The food and service were amazing, despite the challenges of feeding 75 people all at once.  Servers got us our drinks quickly, refilled our water glasses often, and kept those huge yummy rolls coming!  We ate family style (ordering 4 big dishes to be shared), and yet the kitchen was able to accommodate a few of us who had dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free).  The salad was a healthy prelude to all the fantastic food to come!  The penne vodka was the best i've ever had - the pasta was pleasantly al dente and the vodka sauce has a nice mix of flavors (slightly tangy, slightly sweet, slightly peppery).  The meat-eaters at the table were equally ranting and raving about the veal shiitake (in a marsala sauce) and the chicken martini (in a white wine sauce).  Can't wait to go back the next time we're in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Scratch made Italian food some of the best food in town for cheese rigatoni Was delicious beef lasagna was very good Cannoli was made from scratch one of the best I've ever had highly recommend staff is even lniceThere is no mention of guy Fieri  anywhere in the restaurant so that's a good thing"}
{"text":"If I was a local and powerful don and I needed somewhere from which to run my crime syndicate,  this would be my home base.  Either here or Christos in Phoenix.  It has that formal Chicago/New York Italian feel to it...and I like it a lot.

Ambiance aside, the food is the real attraction.  Everything I've eaten there is of the finest quality, resembling the perfect blend of taste and presentation."}
{"text":"Have to say being from NYC area was not expecting much for Italian in Phoenix area. This place was outstanding. Service was very good and the food was exceptional. Best meal we had on our vacation."}
{"text":"The food was BOMB!  Order the eggplant rollantine with 4 cheese sauce in lieu of marinara. Must try it!!!  The desserts were stellar. Pumpkin cheesecake and tiramisu = holy amazingness."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add that I received a personal message from the owner apologizing for our experience and promising a better one next time. In this day and age of no customer service, this was a very classy and professional touch. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Hot waiters they say.  Most of them must be off on Sunday night, although we did see an old dude walking around in a tie-I assume he was the manager-that or  I've got a seriously different definition of hot than the average girl.

This was our first time here, and we were not disappointed.  We had an appetizer of roasted red peppers, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto.  Perfect with the warm rolls they serve.  My husband and I both had pasta dishes-mine was good ole' spaghetti and meatballs, and those balls were big!  We're talking about the food now, not the waiters, so keep up.  My husband had linguine with crab meat.  We both thought our dishes were excellent as well as the tiramisu we shared.

Service was excellent.  I like how they brought a board out with all the specials on it and left it at the table to check out, rather than rattling off the options, most of which you will forget by the time they're done reciting them.

I knock a star off as I thought the pasta dishes were overpriced.  $14 for the spaghetti and $23 for the linguine with crab-it wasn't like there was a pound of crab meat in it!  But overall, a great meal.  We'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"We went to Pasta Brioni for dinner on Christmas Day. They were really busy and we didn't have a reservation, but they managed to get us in without a wait!

After being seated, waters and bread were served immediately. They took our order, we both ordered a pasta entree and decided to split a salad. The salad showed up within 2 minutes and I know they were making them fresh, as we saw them making them while we were waiting for our seat. 

My girlfriend had spaghetti and meatballs, I had four cheese rigatoni. The spaghetti was the homemade fatter noodle. It was so good, and the meatballs were to die for. 

The four cheese rigatoni was piping hot, perfect consistency and very good. 

No less than 4 staff checked in on us throughout the meal, the hostess, the manager, a server and a busboy. 

We really enjoyed the experience. We'll be back again soon, but it may also become a new annual Christmas tradition."}
{"text":"I came to Pasta Brioni during a work trip to Arizona. It is a conveniently located restaurant not to far from the airport with a ton of parking. They offer a wide range of Italian fares from pasta, pizza, seafood, and more. They also have a large wine list as well.

The decor reminds me of the old school NYC Italian restaurant. The dim lighting sets the right mood for drinks and food. For dinner I got the salmon with a glass of white wine. The salmon was very delicious. It was perfectly cooked and marinated. Each bite made me wanting more and more.

Overall, great food and fantastic service. I will definitely consider coming back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"There's just something about Sunday night and pasta. It goes together like... tomatoes and mozzarella? Last night, I made my way to this neighborhood pasta shop for a family dinner. My meal was spectacular. I ordered the Linguini with seafood and I'm pretty sure the entire ocean was on my plate...in a good way. They brought out the plate of Linguini with all the seafood toppings including squid, shrimp, oysters, clams and probably some fish I couldn't even name for you. At any rate, it was delish! The pasta sauce complimented the fish perfectly and I found myself eating much more of it than I should have. 

So speaking of seafood, Pasta Brioni accidentally must have merged with a sushi joint last night and they accidentally brought my Mom her halibut more on the \"still swimming\" side of the plate rather than cooked. When we brought it to the server's attention he was mortified and I will say this... Because of how apologetic the server was, how they handled the situation and how accommodating they were with their mistake, I don't see a reason to have the experience alter my impression of Pasta Brioni. They brought my Mom out a new meal in record time and we were well on our way, after delicious Tiramisu and some chocolate mousse plate of goodness of course!

In summary, sometimes it's entirely about how a restaurant handles unfortunate situations. It seemed like the kitchen just had a \"whoops\" moment and that happens to the best of us, so for that I give them a get out of jail free card. Other restaurants should follow their customer service lead! Plus, I think I might have been in my own food coma of happiness from my own meal. Is it bad that I couldn't wait for my Mom to get her replacement meal and instead scarfed down my personal ocean on a plate? I did give her a little taste as she waited for her own."}
{"text":"The waiters are pretty hot.. well not all of them but many.. the food is so so.. service, if I had bigger boobs I think the service would have been better.. would not return.. I wake up to a hot man every morning so I have no worries about checking the waiters out again."}
{"text":"The Godfather Grinder was amazing and comes with delish pasta salad!  Finished it off with some cheesecake and was super satisified!!"}
{"text":"Penne vodka. Cannoli. You're good to go. 

Literally, you can eat in or just walk into the pickup door (north side of the building) and take any of their meals to go without needing to call ahead."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Our waiter was really nice, but kept calling my mom sweetheart and we thought that was a little weird. It was super hot in there, to the point I felt sick. Kind of hurried to get out of there, because of this. 
They started with water, then brought one roll on a plate to each of us, then our drinks and meal. 
I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and iced tea and my mom ordered originally the Chx Marsala, but he recommended the Chx Eggplant meal (forgot name) so she got that. Food was pretty good. Nothing too amazing. Bill was $40 almost for two of us. Just expected more for the price of it. Will I go back? Eh? Maybe...."}
{"text":"I tried the Spaghetti Bolognese and it was amazingly good. It tasted like my grandmother spaghetti. But was better. My grandmother would be jealous. Everything here is just amazing. Service is 5 stars by far!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Italian food. Their Vodka Penne and Caprese Salad - OMG SOOO perfectly delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing .... went w my aunt and uncle and we had spaghetti, shrimp scampi, and eggplant and ALL were amazing!

Evan is awesome - even as an Australian ;)

Highly Recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently hosted a wedding rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding. He and his fiance had selected Pasta Brioni as the location for the rehearsal dinner for around 50 guests. They were getting married at a church right down the street, so location was prefect. We had never been into pasta Brioni, but had driven by a 1000 times. Once engaging with Dave the manager it was very easy to select the menu and other items we wanted. The dining room was reserved for us and everything was just prefect. We were entertaining mostly people from New York and I wondered how the picky New Yorkers would react to AZ Italian. Everyone loved the food and committed on the excellent service. We could not of selected a better venue for a event like this. I am a \"chicken parmigiana\" freak and I have to say it's the best I have ever had. Thank you Dave and staff for the prefect rehearsal dinner!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for 6 PM, got there at 5:50 PM and we're seated right away. Table was already. My daughter wasn't feeling well so we ordered soup it took them 45 minutes before they even realized she was never given the soup, I had to ask for it. We didn't get out of there until a quarter after eight we had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for our food. A party of eight came in after us and left 25 minutes before us. Not too happy with them. Not like they used to be."}
{"text":"UNREMARKABLE is the best rating I can offer. while it has been a few years since I last visited, I had been anticipating a some what better of a dinning experience. It seems no one there knows how to smile or make a guest feel welcome. I had made on line reservations 5 days prior to our visit on 4/27. we arrived a few minutes before our 7 PM reservation by a very disinterested host/manager who offered no greeting other than \"please follow me\". At this time he proceeded to lead us to the outside patio, it was in the mid 90's that day and I had no desire to sit outside. When  I advised him that I would prefer to sit in one of the two open tables in the main dinning room his only comment other than let me check was that there was no preference on my reservation to which I replied that most restaurants ASK if we would like outside dinning.

I followed him back to the host stand where after a moment he said OK take the table in the dinning room,  he made no effort to escort us there and an attitude was clearly shown. It took  a waiter a good 5 minutes to greet us at the table and apologize for being behind and that he would return shortly. From here on the service was painfully slow and other than at the end the server finally said he was sorry that the kitchen was backed up. Mr. Personality that originally sat us was positioned but a few feet from our table the entire meal never did stop by and say hello or say that he was sorry for any seating issues that we incurred.

By the way, the food was just OK, not worth the 25 minute trip when I have Maggiano's, Carrabba's and Nicks all within two miles of my home. NO one at Pasta Brioni's even tried to make me feel like I was a valued guest. I prefer to spend my $$$$ where my presence is appreciated.

{"text":"Pasta Brioni in a nut shell: Hot waiters. Mediocre food."}
{"text":"Stallone with the earrings is good to look at but not as good as these croutons in my Caesar salad. The food is delicious and Kim Crawford coming in clutch with the Sav blanc.."}
{"text":"4 words -cold chicken pasta salad!  i LOVE this place.  i try to make a trip here at least every other week on my lunch breaks.  I usually go to the \"to go\" side of the restaurant just because i'm grabbing a quick lunch during work.  i have always had fantastic, fast, friendly service.  i strongly recommend you going here for a lunch or even a romantic evening out.  Always a winner!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the years.  It seems like it's losing its mojo a little.  The decor is a bit shabby and in need of a refresh.  On a Saturday night it was pretty dead.

We sat at the bar and our bartender was very nice.  Her tattoos were great!  The  beer selection was kinda weak.  Memo to Brioni:  there's a craft beer revolution going on and Sam Adams and Blue Moon don't cut it any more.

The bread is very good and the linguine pescatore is always a winner.

I had an OK experience here but just not as good as I've remembered from past visits over the last 15 years."}
{"text":"Awesome service...good traditional Italian cuisine....love Pasta Brioni!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive.
Service, ambiance and bread were good. However, if you put pasta in your restaurants name, don't serve it over cooked. Ruins the meal. The Penne vodka sauce was good with over cooked, I imagine precooked and reheated pasta. I added chicken; that should have been grilled and seasoned, but was no doubt boiled with no flavor whatsoever. I did not even eat it for the extra 3 bucks.  If you bring bread to the table, bring butter, but not butter that is so hard you can't even get it on the bread. Pasta Brioni is saved by the ambiance."}
{"text":"Pasta Brioni is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Scottsdale! I love the Penne Vodka pasta with pees! This restaurant was the first place I went out to eat when I moved to Scottsdale and I've loved it ever since. I also love that there is a section just for fast take out, so during the day it is quick and easy and during the night it is a nice dine-in restaurant. It is affordable and delicious! So glad I came across it the first day I moved to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pasta Brioni more than a handful of times over the years... and I've never been disappointed.  It's a fun girls night out, but it's also great for date night or with a group.

Most recently, I went with a group of 8 of us on a Saturday night.  It was a spontaneous decision that the birthday girl (Halley S) made with some persuasion from her fiance and my boyfriend too.  (I think they really wanted Italian food).  Luckily, Brioni accommodated us and we were seated within minutes of arriving.

The ownership may have changed, and maybe the waiters weren't as HOT as i remembered, but we were all pleased with our experience.  Justin was our waiter and he put up with some random questions from my boyfriend (IE - are all Maryland Crab Cakes from Maryland?) - he'd been drinking all day long; forgive him!

The warm rolls were as good as ever and we were all happy that there was plenty of olive oil, parmesan, and balsamic on the table ready and waiting for us to dip into!  I started with a dirty Grey Goose martini and it went down real easy... The birthday girl and some of the other girls seemed to enjoy their blueberry lemon drop martinis also.  Some of us had wine with dinner and that was good too... 

Onto the food - I had a few bites of the artichoke appetizer (note that it's served cold, but it's tasty!)  For my entree, I went with the tilapia special of the day - it was a huge portion and it was great; served with veggies but I had a side of pasta too (after all, we were at PASTA Brioni!)  Others in the group had the grilled salmon special, mushroom ravioli, gnocchi, chicken martini (this is a special recipe that is really good) and maybe chicken parmesan.  No complaints from anyone - pretty cool!

We didn't order dessert since we had Sprinkles cupcakes... it was really sweet that our waiter even served them for us - not all restaurants are so accommodating when you bring in outside food).  All that and total per person (of course we all paid for the birthday girl too) was $48 including 20% tip.  Not bad for a Saturday night out for a special occasion!

We are excited to be moving back into the Old Town 'hood - I'm sure we'll make Pasta Brioni one of our regular stops on the restaurant rotation... maybe we'll see you there?!"}
{"text":"Took the girlfriend on Valentine's Day after making a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived they set a table and showed us to our table outside. It was a great night so it was comfortable, but the overhead lights being so bright it took away from the ambiance.

They had specials for the night and their normal menu. One entree was sold out, rigatoni with bolognese which is probably what I would have ordered so I go spaghetti with meatballs. I am not by any means a pasta connoisseur, but this was the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, very tasty and well seasoned sauce and awesome meatballs.

Someone came by and offered rolls, they were tasty however dry without anything else. Girlfriend's was a bit burnt. Prices overall are little higher than I would expect.

We'll be back, I look forward to trying the chicken parm."}
{"text":"I've passed the place for years and have always wanted to try it. I found them as a delivery option on Grub hub, wish I knew they delivered this whole time. The spaghetti is delicious,  the lasagna is delicious, and the caprese salad is fancier than any other I've had and delicious :-)"}
{"text":"First time here. Great little place. Nice, but not to fancy. Great food and atmosphere.  Would recommend !"}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation of my nail technician, but I thought it was going to be better but that's probably my fault for setting the expectation. I found toasted ravioli after so long and it was pre-doused in marinara, bah. I wanted a dish that was on the dinner menu, but was told \"the kitchen is too busy tonight, can't do that\" so that was a bummer. The penne al vodka was okay, thus the 2 stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to order from there again."}
{"text":"Great chicken penne vodka!  They forgot my chicken once on a to go order and they sent a fresh order to my home and added in a piece of chocolate cake!  Fast service.  Good food."}
{"text":"Service was just ok, food was good but a little too pricey.  They were really slow to get us food and check.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"The absolute best happy hour in the Valley! The food and drink options are wonderful especially the mussels and the happy hour wines are quite good. Did I mention the price? This place is affordable."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day and was highly satisfied with the whole experience! There are two sections to the establishment with separate entrances. One side is more casual dining cafe with a smaller menu (mostly pizza) and the other side is a more upscale restaurant with a wider variety of entree options.  We ordered the linguine pescatore, shrimp and sausage linguine in Parmesan cream sauce, and the mussels as an appetizer. Everything was delicious and not a bad price at all for the amount and quality of food! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here last night despite quite a few yelpers giving it a thumbs  down. But like most things.. you kinda just have to experience it yourself no matter what others say. Well the funny thing is I went to the cafe side which was completely empty and the menu was pretty sparse compared to the website, so right then I was disappointed and wished my date wasnt on his way to meet me there......UNTIL my date found me and brought me to the \"other side\" which was jam packed and full of energy.. not to mention offering an extensive menu. Yay and thank god! it turns out the other side is more of the \"to go\" side. Okay so the rolls came out and they werent awful but they weren't warm and doughy which is what i had expected from other reviews.. but that was okay. If they had been warm and doughy I would have eaten 10 so it was actually a better situation. We started with the caprese salad which they automatically split on 2 separate plates, which I thought was great initiative. I have to say that was probably the BEST Caprese I have ever had. Those tomatoes were unspeakably good! To follow I ordered the Antipasta salad it was perefect I had no complaints whatsoever. My date had a seafood pasta, I cant remember which one and he wasn't moaning over it but he definitely didn't complain. So I guess it all depends on what you order..maybe. But I was pleased enough to return sometime and try something else, no question."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pasta Brioni based on high marks from several friends. The atmosphere and service were fine but the food was disappointing. Our shrimp
risotto was more like shrimp and wild rice and the linguini pesto chicken needed salt to bring out the flavor and I never salt my food. Disappointing food in both our meals. Maybe other dishes are better but it will be a long time before we go again to find out. Save your money, there are several better choices within walking distance."}
{"text":"The red sauce has no flavor.  The chicken martini was soggy....not crispy, I specifically asked for crispy.  It was a soggy mess.  I also requested light sauce.  Again. Soggy.   The butter served with the bread was sweet.... ? 

The worse part was the loud private conversation of the wait staff and the bartender. They stood right behind us and were extremely loud, laughing shouting.....Really horrible.  

The dust on the blinds (that we were right next too) was an inch thick. Needless to say, not good. I would not even call it Italian food. ..I have been to Italy and this food is more Long Island 1960's chef boyardee then anything I ever ate in Italy.  Even the beet salad was terrible.  How do mess that up, try Terrible dressing, bitter lettuce.  Some sort of beet that tasted sour and old.  We will not be back. Again I wonder where the owner is and if he eats there."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was understaffed. My meal was good but my dates was served cold. The pasta he took a bite of was on the plate returned. 
I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"I have always adored this restaurant because the service is fantastic and the pasta is some of the best you'll find anywhere.  This evening, the server, Megan, and Chef Michael Siggins outdid themselves. My dr. recently put me on a strict anti-inflammatory diet where all legumes, grains, dairy and nightshades (like tomato and eggplant) are out of the question (which sucks tremendously when dining at a fabulous Italian restaurant). Megan listened to my limitations, made great suggestions, and when she told Chef Siggins about my dilemma, he personally came out to talk to me, and ultimately created a delicious, satisfying dish that was completely in line with what I'm allowed to eat. The level of care Megan and Chef Siggins showed for my dietary limitations and the quality of the scrumptious dish I enjoyed were far and away beyond what I expected. They obviously take a lot of pride in what they do.  Many thanks and kudos!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I order take out a lot. The Caprese salad and beef sandwich are my favorites. I've ordered their pizza before and love it - they are also one of the few places that have kalamata olives! Delivery charge is $1, unlike many of the chain places around that charge quite a bit more. I've always had really great service. If there is something up they've always called me right away and I've yet to meet one of their delivery folks I haven't really liked. Today they did especially well, were especially fast and helped me get my cat back inside :)"}
{"text":"So all this hype on hot waiters had this place on my list to do on my Stay-cation. 

Sad to say, I was majorly disappointed!

A group of gals hit this place for a late lunch on a Friday. The server acted like he was bothered from the get-go. The service was slow and he was rude and cold.

The food was pretty good. I had meatballs and capellini. The sauce was one of the best I have had. My friends enjoyed pizza and a meatball sandwich.

I would possibly return for the good food. The service left something to be desired, especially a hot hospitable Italian man."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pasta place! Their happy hour is unbeatable for apps, pasta dishes, and wine! Every time I'm in town I have to make a stop here or order it for delivery! My favorites are the toasted ravioli, Caesar salad, and by far...their penne vodka with chicken! They also just opened their new patio which is great for groups! Wendy is the best bartender ever and Dave is the most down to earth owner! You will feel like family when you're here! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like Brioni's.  The Happy Hour specials are a steal.  The ambiance is usually very good.  I like the old school formal wooden decor.  The food is anywhere from good to outstanding depending on the item.  In general, they follow the Italian tradition of choosing the best ingredients, instead of gimmicky crap.

I really like the mussels with the marachiara sauce.  That (clear tomato with garlic) sauce is worth a trip.  The calamari salad is also a wonderful and healthy choice.  Split that with a friend at happy hour followed by a pasta dish and you're eating like a king for nothin'.  I've had 4 or 5 pasta dishes that were all great.  Today, I had the chicken sorrentino which was very good.

However, I did have one bad experience that I'd like to share for the purpose of entertaining Yelpers and perhaps fixing the issue at a restaurant I enjoy eating at.

If you're about to eat, you might want to stop reading.  

- I ordered my food.  It was a later in the lunch hour and pretty empty.
- I went to the bathroom.
- After going, I saw there was NO toilet paper.  This is pretty bad for an upscale restaurant, but whatever.  Call it an oversight.
- So, I called the restaurant from my cell phone and explained that I was in the bathroom in need of toilet paper.
- No one ever came.  I gave up because I was in a hurry during the work day.
- After eating, I checked the bathroom again.  Still, no toilet paper.

I know this is a weird situation and I've eaten here about six times with no similar issues.  I was too bashful to bring it up again in person and there was no feedback link on their web site.  So, I'm hoping someone will read this review at the restaurant and fix the issue so that it does not happen again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. Our waiter was super attentive and recommended the amazing salmon salad. I don't like eggplant but the eggplant in this salad was really good. The pesto pasta was just alright. It really didn't meet my expectations which was sad. The salad and service was good enough."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the most flavorless food I've ever had. You wouldn't think that a decent Italian place would manage to screw up the most basic dish, spaghetti and meatballs, but they did. Thankfully I ordered this to go, so I was able to add seasoning to the sauce at home. The meatballs were close to inedible with their lack of flavor and generally old taste. Do not come here. If they can't make the basics, they don't deserve the business."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  My parents were celebrating their 65th wedding anniversary and I booked the small wine cellar room for my family and out of town guests.  The food was exceptional and the service was phenomenal.  We had at least two waiters ensuring that our every need was met.  Everyone had a wonderful evening that will not soon be forgotten.  Thank you, Pasta Brioni!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great and they have superior wait service.  Never a bad meal or dinning experience."}
{"text":"Classic Italian Food.   Great service.  Our waiter was personable, and was very accommodating to our special requests.   The decor is very nice, what you might expect from an upscale old Italian place on the east coast.    Everyone loved the food.   We started with a artichoke to share, and it was a great treat."}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem in Scottsdale, the inside is very cozy, and they just got their patio section remodeled. The service is impeccable, food is great, and everything from the kitchen is made from scratch. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the Pros.  My meal was very good I couldn't stop eating it.  Laid back atmosphere.  Server was friendly and put together a meal for my friend that wasn't on the menu.

The cons were the portion sizes were massive.  I know in the Italian culture pasta is served in big portions, but I took half of the dish home, and pasta the next day is just not the same.  Since the prices are high and you get what you pay for, I'd rather have a smaller portion with a lower price.  I ordered what I believed to be a side ceaser salad.  That was also huge, seemed like a whole head of lettuce.  It was very tasty, maybe a bit to much dressing that caused it to be not crispy.  It was also disappointing the server didn't offer to crack pepper on the salad and pasta, and offer grated cheese on the pasta.  To be honest, I would have been happy with the bread and salad and I would have been full for 6.50.  Yes, the side salad was 6.50, that was a bit ridiculous.  I had a glass of wine which was wonderful and priced very well.  So I think lowering the prices and the amount of food they give you can set this place over the top."}
{"text":"ive been working across the place for almost a year now and finally got a chance to sit down and have dinner. one of our customers once ordered us a bunch of pizza from here and i managed to grab a slice before it all ran out, and it remember it being fairly decent.

its very dark inside here, which sets a romantic mood. the decor is nice and everything looked well put together. the rolls were good and served with olive oil and parm. ice cold water, and our server was fast to greet us and get us started with a beer and a glass of wine. he showed us the specials for the day on the board, and we went with this chicken dish (forgot the name) to split (which he didnt end up charging us the $3 split plate fee for).

the dish arrived in a timely fashion with a side of penne pasta. it was 2 generous-sized chicken breasts stuffed with 3 different kinds of melted cheese served over this absolutely delicious sauce and spinach. i guess it could be similar to the french chicken cordon bleu and it absolutely blew coup des tarte's one (priced at $30, and only 1 breast) out of the water. if you love chicken, pasta, and cheese, you must try this. i just  wish i could remember what it was called.

we had a pricing problem which was easily adjusted by our server with no hassle.

all the servers in there are cute italian boys. the old woman seated at the table next to us drank way to much wine and was haphazardly flirting with our server. 

can't wait to try more of their pasta, i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Start with the sangria- it is the best I have ever had! Their bread and honey butter is to die for, I even asked for more! We got their chicken salad and lobster ravioli. Both were great choices and the staff was friendly and helpful. Absolutely no complaints- we will be coming back next time we are in town!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but every time I order online which is often, they mess up my order. I called once and it took 2 hours to deliver the mistake. To give them the benefit of the doubt I'm close to old town scottsdale so it's a busy area. But to spend $50 on a meal that your not happy with is hard to swallow sometimes"}
{"text":"Great dinner, authentic Italian. Great service and wow the food amazing! Nice cozy place for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Lived in the Pasta Brioni neighborhood for 4 years and finally ate here last night. Very very good Italian food, very rare in AZ. Prices are a little high, but everything is homemade so it's worth it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Our meal was ok. Nothing to write home about. How does an italian restaurant run out of Bolognese?"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this restaurant. We had the Halibut (daily special) and the lamb. The lamb was perfectly done and very flavorful. Halibut also very good.

Our waiter was also 5 star and helped make the whole meal perfect. 

We will be back.

Don't forget to try the cheesecake. They call it NY cheesecake, but it is really better than that."}
{"text":"Amazing food with even better service. If you are in the area and looking for delicious Italian food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I was craving pasta with something ... something I can't make at home. Some kind of... I don't know. Comfort food with flair, if you will.  We were seated at a table in the bar area right away. Good service. Those rolls that everyone is loving were not warm, and didn't have much flavor. Neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin, too. 
Entree: My escort asked the server if they carry lasagna, which they do, but don't include on the menu \"along with a few other things because there's no room for it on the menu.\" ? I thought this was weird, as it's half a menu: one board with a wine list on one side and food on the other. It doesn't fold like a food menu, it's just the one piece, like a wine list. Maybe I wouldn't have ordered the rigatoni bolognese from the specials board had I had more choices and I wasn't about to make the server stand there and recite all the things they could make for me. Then again, had I done that, I might have found something to eat with a little more ... kick, if you will. I mean, my food was not bad. It was fine. But that's just it - it didn't blow me away. I could have made that and saved (my hot date) a few bucks. I had a glass of pinot from CA that was good. And the entertainment (drunk middle-aged women with an unhealthy obsession with Matt Lauer) was okay. 
It wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but I won't be returning because it was really no big deal. 
Oh, my date had that lasagna and I didn't try it, but was told \"Fine.\" when asked how it was, and he was actually talking about the food (and not some I'm-mad-at-you-but-not-telling-you boyspeak). It looked like it had cheese on top. No shit, it's lasagna. Not a good descriptor, I know."}
{"text":"Love their crusted chicken salad! But quality does seem to be sporadic... and the price is up there. The bread it comes with is always fresh"}
{"text":"For AZ this is one of the best Italian restaurants. The food is good. I love the chicken and creamy red sauce and rigatoni dish the best. The pizza is also very good. They ambiance is fine. The prices are reasonable. Also a good central location with plenty of parking"}
{"text":"Awesome food, better service, and an awesome staff! Great happy hour on the bar side. Wendee rules!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow. Had a large group service was amazing. food is delicious I had always heard great things but those things are true and then some. The Calamari was amazing and fresh. the Pizza was just right, i like to fold my slice! All the appetizers we had were perfect. We did some pre gaming for a bachelor party but the apps were so good we had to get more food. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Youngest ladies in the room, again! If that's what you're looking for. The food was great. Sat at the bar and sampled some wine, hung out with no pressure and once again, managers who are invested in their business are a big plus.  Salad was excellent and entrée even better. Good bread, which I miss. Will be back."}
{"text":"THE BRIONI BOYS ARE BACK!!! And they are serving the best authentic Italian food in the hood. Wine selection is phenomenal. Even the bread is much better now.The patio now has a real comfy feeling. I, always sit at the bar, and personally have tried every item on the happy hour menu. My favorite is still spaghetti and meatballs or the 4 cheese rigatoni  But you must come on Thursday night to listen to great jazz and watch one of the BOYS pour your favorite wine."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale! Been coming here for years and am always impressed. The service makes you feel at home and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Meh truly is the best rating for my experience at Pasta Brioni. 

I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. 

The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.

We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. 

For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.

My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! 

My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. 

Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. 

Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions."}
{"text":"This is a good local spot for Italian. The food is amazing and the service is usually pretty good. Delivery options make it convenient to order on late work nights. Oh, and check the staff calendar if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour and the food is always amazing. Home made pasta and always a special board full of creative dishes. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent and inexpensive.

The rest of the food is good as well, but a bit more expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight and I could not be more impressed! The angel hair pasta, garlic bread, toasted ravioli! Devine! Even the salad was crisp and perfect!! 10 stars!"}
{"text":"So, I was introduced to Pasta Brioni about two years ago by one of my best friends and her sister.  We trying to decide where to eat, and they we're like \"Let's go to Pasta Brioni because the servers are sooooo hot!\"  So we went, and yes the server was very good looking.  The girls were pleased.

Aside from the staff, the food has been good every time I have been there.  I always get the four cheese rigatoni, and it is very good.  If you go...get the crab cakes as a starter.

Go for the food, the \"soooo hot\" staff that I have heard about has been hit or miss."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago for a \" girls night \" dinner before heading out and it was AMAZING. I am Italian, and pretty much a Italian food snob and this place felt like I was eating Sunday Dinner at my grandma's house. 
We signed up for their e-mails online and scored buy 1 get 1 free vouchers. We ( group of 5 ) ordered a few entrees and shared: Antipasto salad, chicken martini, spinach and ricotta dumplings ( AMAZING  - and I am not a big ricotta cheese fan, but these were superb ) the bread was great - the service was friendly and very good. Not sure whats up with some of these negative reviews - but it's a excellent italian spot and I will continue to return."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicken Parm...we mostly get it for take out.  The piece of chicken is huge, moist and amazing.  It comes with a big side of pasta, an amazing cesaer salad and bread.  They deliver as well..so if you don't even want to get up off the couch...this is one excellent call.

If you want to eat in...if you a girl...go in looking great because all of the waiters are really good looking with very in shape bodies...it is eye candy for you and tummy filling great too!"}

Companion and I visited this restaurant during Arizona Restaurant Week. Pasta Brioni has been in business for many years, and has had a good reputation.

We started out with an appetizer of Calamari Fritti. The calamari was properly fried and was nice and tender, though the marinara sauce was a bit watery and lacking in tomato taste. Rolls were also brought out and were served with a compound butter made with sweet butter.

Next were our salads. We both ordered the Caprese Salad, which had nice pieces of mozzarella, thick slices of tomato, and balsamic vinaigrette along with a chiffonade of basil.

For the main course, companion ordered lobster ravioli and I ordered linguini pescatore. This is where we ran into problems. The ravioli was much more al dente than it should have been, though the flavor was fine.  The linguini was actually under cooked thought the seafood in it was definitely over cooked. The other problem was that the sauce was thin and watery with virtually no tomato flavor. I don't like to post about problems with food, but this was definitely in need of help and was not finished by me. 

Dessert was Mascarpone Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Cake. Once again, I got the short end of the stick. The cheesecake had a funny flavor that I did not care for. The chocolate cake was like a big slice of chocolate fudge and is to be recommended.

Service was good as was cleanliness.

Overall, this meal was a disappointment. I can only hope that it was this meal and not a regular meal of the restaurant.

3 stars"}
{"text":"The service here is immaculate. I came 15 minutes before dinner service at 5pm, and there was only one patron at the bar.  The bartender was very personable as were the other staff, and actually seen to recognize recurring customers.  The atmosphere is very calming.  There is some sports memorabilia around the bar, yet very tasteful decor throughout. Mike was my server for the night, very pleasant guy.

I ordered the caprese salad, gluten free spaghetti without meatballs, and the tiramisu.  The gluten free pasta comes out to be penne instead of spaghetti, but the sauce is very flavorable."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  Excellent service.  Good food, but not as good as my favorite Italian restaurant in the Texas Hill Country.  We had the linguini pescadore, spaghetti and meatballs, and eggplant little plate.  Marinara is very rich and was in both the spaghetti and eggplant.  Pescadore was good but not very much seafood flavor in the broth.  And the rolls were fresh and dense, but could definitely have used some more garlic them.  I also didn't understand the honey butter on the table.  Way too American for a lovely little Italian themed restaurant like this one.  My first post was removed because I named my favorite Hill Country Italian restaurant so I'm hoping this one makes it past the censors.  Also, credit to the manager who reached out to ask what could have been done to improve my experience after my first post.  That's always a good sign."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good, especially after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp. But sadly, it was just mediocre. 
I was expecting good crusty italian bread for starters. 
What I got was a hand delivered small roll, neither crusty or warm. My wife commented how it was mealy. It was.
My Pasta E Fagioli had a slight vinegar taste and not balsamic vinegar, white vinegar. Yuk.
My wife ordered chicken parm with a side of meatballs. The meatballs were just ok. The chicken parm had a good flavor but the presentation looked bad. Sparsely melted cheese that looked like it had just barely melted in a microwave and not the lightly browned cheese evidencing time spent in a hot oven. 
I had the four cheese rigitoni which was actually pretty good. 
After the bread, the soup, and the yukky looking chicken parm, we chose not to spend any more $$ on desert. 
Service and ambiance was above average, but the food wasn't quite what we were hoping for, not for the money anyway. 
Our search goes on for good Italian in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area.

Overall, not a bad place, but for the $$, I'll get a bottle of Rao's sauce, some meatballs from Guidos, and save the grief."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery because the hubs was out of town and I wanted comfort food. I got the ravioli and lasagna (which between the two, lasted me 4 meals!) and both were awesome! The delivery was quick as well! 

They came with small side salads which was nice so that I could be extra lazy and not have to make one for myself :) The pasta was tender but still had a good bite to it and the sauce was my favorite - simple and sweet!"}
{"text":"I've eaten their food at least a dozen times, but have always gotten it To-Go.  

Having tried several dishes, I can honestly say the food is decent.  It's not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst.  The sauce is always bland, no matter which dish I order.  I always need to spice it up, once I bring it home.

Pricing is okay.  Usually spending around $35 for 2 dishes (my wife and I).  

I've never utilized their delivery service, but overheard employees telling customers that they commonly run an hour and a half for delivery."}
{"text":"This is the spot for a bachelorette party dinner! 

We had a group of 14 & were treated like the queens that we are. I hadn't been to Pasta Brioni in quite some time, but when we were organizing a bachelorette party one of us suggested this place for dinner because of the hot waiters (yeah, I'm just gonna be shallow, and not play coy about that) & its proximity to Old Town. 

I think they actually offer set menu deals for large parties, but with a group of girls (who may or may not by picky eaters) we didn't take advantage of this. I don't think any of the set menus include alcohol. 

I had the mushroom risotto & it was fantastic! It was creamy, but not too creamy, and they're was just the right amount of vegetables to risotto. I didn't care that I was amongst all girls, I happily ate the whole thing. 

Service was fantastic as well! I believe our waiter's name was John (I can't believe I can't 100% remember his name) & he definitely played up the fact this was a bachelorette party group. That being said, all of our orders were correct (except for one minor drink order) and everyone was very happy with the food and service. 

I should also point out the bachelorette got a special dessert at the end of the night ;)

I would definitely come back to Pasta Brioni for any type of meal, but I would especially keep them in mind again for a large dinner party."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this local eatery 3-6 times a year for 7 years. Have even attended and held small dinner parties (15 people or so). The food has always been excellent and we really never have had a complaint. Service is average at times. Last night my wife and I joined another couple at PB for dinner. My wife ordered the lamb chops which where cooked well past medium rare. When the waiter inquired about or meals my wife mentioned that the cops were over done. He peaked at the chops and agreed that they were not as ordered and offered to redo the dish. My wife said ok. 10-15 minutes later when everyone else was nearly finished the waiter walked by the table and noticed my wife's nearly full dinner plate. Something clicked and he headed to the kitchen. Our guess is he forgot to place the reorder or the kitchen did not do it. He came back to the table almost immediately and said the chops should be out shortly. My wife declined. They did remove her dish from the tab but  did not even offer her a complimentary dessert. Just disappointing after so many good visits."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this joint, I havent enjoyed pasta for a few months and was really looking forward to consuming food here. Let me tell you, for as long as it was to actually receive and consume the food.... it was worth it. The food was phenomenal, that was about it. Unfortunately it was incredibly busy due to the marathon, as well as the auctions. Meal tickets were getting lost, it was mass MASS chaos. Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said \"Nope, can't do it we have people outside.\" Before I could even respond, he took his little elf self and ran away. We also had our son along, this place is not so good for kids."}
{"text":"Service: flawless. Host helped right away giving options of table, booth, bar and out door. Waiter was on his A game. Filling waters, getting orders, everything was great. No complaints. 

Food: yum! Italian food. Bug portions. Enough to split or take home for leftovers. Hot bread brought after ordering. On the table balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil available. We ordered a Caesar salad to share and I got the penne vodka with chicken. Pasta cooked well. Sauce was balanced. 
It is very good pasta. I will be returning. 

Environment/ambiance: very Italian restaurant. Had some TVs at the bar. Dark lighting. Outside was nice. everything was clean. Mixed crowd. More for quiet gatherings or dates. Lots of Frank Sinatra playing. 

Parking: lot, spacious."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a great Italian restaurant in Phoenix for some time. This restaurant came highly recommended, so we drove 40 minutes to give it a try. David the owner took the time to welcome us to the restaurant, which was a nice change of pace. The food was fresh,  and pasta dishes were amazing! We will  definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Scottsdale is that there is a takeout/casual entrance that offers the same menu and kitchen as the more expensive fine dining front of the restaurant for lower prices. Respectable pizza and pasta dishes that are good portions."}
{"text":"The food and service here are always stellar! We last ate at Pasta Brioni on 8/9/15. There were 9 of us and we all thought our pasta was some of the best we'd ever had. Caleb was our waiter and he was awesome - very knowledgeable about the menu, very attentive and very funny!"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night before a movie.  I had read the reviews about being welcomed right away and sure enough, the wait staff was on top of it.  Super friendly and welcoming. 

My waiter was flippin' fantastic. I'm not sure if he was the owner or manager or something, he was dressed differently than the other wait staff. He gave some fantastic recommendations, he was funny, just an all out pleasure. The food was also fantastic. I read one review that complained about the sweet butter that they serve with the bread: I admit, I was first taken aback by it but learned to love it. All in all, great food, great service, fantastic ambiance. Perfect.

And I almost forgot one more thing! One of the people I went with is gluten-free (I know, **groan** haha just kidding), and our server brought out a piece of gluten free, flourless chocolate cake on the house. We didn't even ask for anything for dessert. It was a very welcome surprise, and the cake was damn good."}
{"text":"Have tried their takeout many times with little luck. The penne alla vodka comes with very little sauce. I have requested chicken that's been forgotten nearly every time (unfortunate since there is an upcharge for it). This last time the sauce tasted like pure alcohol, so I'm not sure what happened there. We've also tried the chicken parmigiana. My chicken has been chewy more times than it's been good. Maybe it's better in store, but it's too hit or miss for me to attempt that."}
{"text":"I really like this little place.  :)

The food is very good, and I've never had a bad meal here.  Salads, calamari, red sauce, pastas, bread, olive oil...all very, very good.  Dessert was kinda meh (though I ate it anyway - it's rude to wrap with Italians), but they have a decent wine list, so eat up, and skip dessert.

98% of the all-male staff are exceptionally hot, btw (there might have been women working there, but I didn't notice in the sea of tall, dark and handsome and dressed in black).  Playing for both teams, and perhaps even bridging some gaps, there is plenty of eye candy and flirt-worthy boys for everyone.  I was tempted to write my number on a few bev naps and pass them around to anyone who eye fucked me longer than 10 seconds.  I'd recommend not taking a date you're pretty into just for this reason (lesson learned - lol)."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've eaten at Pasta Brioni. The food was as good as I remember and a good bang for the buck. The service however was a little off the mark. We were seated in the back which may have caused delays in our server getting to and checking up on us but that is no excuse, we are in your restaurant and should be treated as well as customers in the front room."}
{"text":"Used it for take-out on a recent trip to Scottsdale. I would say it is stereotypical red sauce and pasta food - nothing special.  The eggplant was overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"A few friends and I had a reservation at 7:30 last Saturday at Pasta Brioni. The restaurant was busy - it seems like a popular spot for snowbirds.  

Even though we had a reservation, we weren't sat at a table until 7:45. At this point, we realized how disorganized the staff was - we had random mis-matched silverwear (at a table with four of us, it took them 10 minutes and 3 tries to get an almost complete set of silverwear - meaning a fork, a knife, a spoon and a side plate - for everyone at the table.) We also didn't get a menu for almost 15 minutes. 

Definitely some issues with the service. Although we sat at 7:45, our server didn't take our order until 8:15. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer salads to arrive, around 8:35. After we finished our salads, it was another 30 minutes before we had our main courses - they didn't arrive until after 9:10. At this point we were starving, the server tried to make light of the situation - apologizing for the delay and joking that he bet we had time to work up an appetite. 

The food was very mediocre - not terrible, but nothing special. In my opinion, definitely not worth the hour wait. They also didn't get all of our orders right - my friend had ordered a pasta dish with chicken, only to have it come out without chicken. Another friend was very disappointed with her meal and barely touched it, she didn't complain but I was surprised they didn't offer to bring her something else or take it off the bill. 

We were all laughing about what a disappointing 2-hour experience it was from start to finish - we won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little pasta joint.  Very New Yorky feel minus Don Corleone :)  I had their pasta pollo which was delicious!  Drinks...well they are what they are... I'm not a big fan of mixed drinks except maybe a Irish car bomb Ouch!  However, order a drink and sit at the bar.  Bartender Brianna was pretty cool and she'll make you smile.  Sitting area for dinner can get crowded but you get a more intimate feel.  If your date likes pasta...well you know where to go now - good luck!"}
{"text":"What a great little place. I sat at the bar with a couple of friends last evening. Being my first time there , of course I wanted to check out all the menus and happy hour.  Pleasantly surprised, happy hour all day. 
Great wines and food. Our bartender mike was the best. 
I had the clams with penne.  The most delicious. 
My friend had the eggplant rollatin.  Also amazing 
I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian dining at a reasonable price. Reservations required as the restaurant is small. 

I had the pasta Bolognese. Delicious, rich, cooked perfectly. Huge portion. Had more than enough to take home for another meal. 

My wife had the eggplant lasagna. Very good. 

Had the cannoli for dessert. Probably the best I've ever eaten. 

Why only four stars?  The waiter was completely disinterested. He came over and asked if we were ready to order. When we hesitated for a couple of seconds, he immediately said he'd come back later. Really?

After our meal was served, he never returned to ask how our meal was. Or to refill our water glass. 

Now, this wasn't some college student. It was apparent he was one of the managers as he was dressed in a sleeves rolled up shirt and slacks. 

We would go back again as this is one of the few restaurants in the Phoenix area that knows how to cook real Italian food that's also delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"Feels like home. Just as if you had your own Italian grandmother cooking with love. I loved sitting at the bar with friends and . . . . I truly enjoyed a meal as if I was in the boot of Italy. The food was so good, I could eat there every night. Not sure I would ever get tired of the food, the service, or the atmosphere. 

A great Margarita, Caprese Salad, Chicken Martini, and Flourless Chocolate Cake. A meal to die for. An angel of a \"grandmother\" in the kitchen to thank for my little bit of heaven on earth."}
{"text":"I only mention this because of all the women reviewers commenting on \"the hot waiters\".  I remember a very friendly and attractive female bartender- This is Scottsdale, home of the beautiful people.  Anyway, I like this place- Not real pricey or pretentious (rare in this town).  Good basic food and drinks- great service, esp at the bar!!  Suggest Linguini and clams or calamari."}
{"text":"How you doin?  The rumors are true ladies, the servers are all men, all hunky, all the time.  If you like 'em tall (or short), dark, handsome and sarcastic, you'll love Pasta Brioni.

The servers even have their own calendar.  Wait.  Is this the male version of Hooters?  

This is a great place to come with the girls for birthday parties, bachelorette parties or 'just because.'  The servers are very attentive- perhaps a little overly- (are lap dances always included with your meal)?? 

The servers aren't the only good part of this restaurant though.  The food is delicious.  The pasta's are all great- the ravioli, pasta giardini, lasagne- you can't really go wrong.

So grab some girls, order a carafe or two of sangria and enjoy the scenery along with a great meal!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food at a very reasonable price! Portions are huge, you'll have plenty of leftovers! 

They serve hot bread rolls with amazing sweet herb butter. Great service, elegant, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to write a great review ... but from the moment we stepped through the door for lunch it was all downhill. 
We were meeting someone else for lunch at 11:30am and walked in to an empty restaurant. Not unusual due to the time. Nobody around to greet us and so we waited. And waited. Finally, my husband said 'hellooooo' and suddenly a girl popped up from a booth in the rear of the room! She said 'oh- sorry- I was just resting because I'm not used to working days and I was so bored'...
Need I continue?
She was also our server. Not sure if this is the norm but honestly one of the strangest experiences I have had in a restaurant. 
The food was OK - I can't even give it an unbiased review because of the way it all began!"}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I ordered delivery and let me tell you it was phenomenal!! We ordered the mussels for starters, Caesar salad, cheesy garlic bread and the penne vodka pasta with chicken! We dipped the bread in the delicious tomato garlic basil sauce that the mussels came drenched in and that was heaven in itself. Delivery came within 20 minutes of my phone call and the service over the phone and at our door was great! So happy we found a new delicious favorite!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the ambiance was very nice. They homemade cheesecake dessert was the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Second visit to Scottsdale -- second visit to Pasta Brioni.   First time was great.  This time -- \"eh\".   Ordered the mussels in a tomato broth (this was very good).   Husband said his chicken parm was just okay; friend's spaghetti and meatballs same thing -- just okay.  My salmon was a bit on the fishy side and I was uber thirsty the entire night.   Actually had to get up out of bed for water during the night.   Seemed pricey for what we got ($40/per person) - with 1 drink each.   Probably won't go back.   Have since heard that ownership has changed and really -- it wasn't worth the drive from Surprise.   Sorry."}
{"text":"This place has a homey feeling to it, like an Italian grandmother made the food from scratch. The food is great, my favorite that I would recommend at any time would be the Chicken parm, it was delicious. The service can be hit or miss,  sometimes the servers can mess up your order, but again is not all the time. Overall 4 or 4.5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food! It was a little pricey but worth it. The service was great and the food was out in a timely manner. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and cute! If you are looking for a good italian meal, I would go to Pasta Brioni."}
{"text":"Where do I begin on this crap fest?  I read some of the other reviews to this place and it's about the same poop, but a different day.

My wife comes from a large Italian family.  We know our Italian.  This my friend is NOT Italian.  The decor was nice, but almost every Italian joint has nice decor.  The menu looked great.  We were so excited.

My wife and I were STARVING when we got in.  We were happy we got seated right away.  They brought out fresh rolls right away and they were delicious.  It's the only reason this place is getting their 1 star.
We got our appetizer of calamari and it was disgusting.  I took a bite and couldn't eat anymore.  My wife was so hungry, she ate it all.  She didn't care.  She thought it was gross too.  The breading was finely grated and seemed like it was cooked in very old oil.  It smelled and tasted like yesterday's oil.  It made me pretty sick.

I got Salmon and my wife got breaded chicken.  My salmon was smelly (very fishy) and overcooked.  Like a hockey puck.  The sauce on the pasta was exactly the sauce that came with the calamari, though our server insisted it was different.  My wife's chicken was topped with melted butter.  I am not sure what the sauce was supposed to be, but it was breaded chicken with melted butter.

Needless to say, we took one bite, sent it back and got our bill.  The interesting thing was our server was not suprised in the least bit.  We ordered what we ordered because our server suggested it.  He didn't ask why we were sending it back.  It was almost like this has already happened a few times so far this evening.  

Overall, AVOID AT ALL COST.  The place is not cheap and you are not getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Yum! This place was delicious with huge portions! 

Recommend the chicken Parmesan !!!"}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. Willing to pay for drinks and more food but servers are inattentive and don't check on tables. Food is excellent though. If you just care for the food, this place is great. If you want an experience with service look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pasta Brioni has excellent authentic Italian food, served by true Italians (warm, charming, welcoming & attractive -- They even have a yearly calendar of the \"Brioni Boys.\"). I love Pasta Brioni for the ambiance of the dining room, a wonderful evening of fine Italian cuisine and the attentiveness of the servers. I feel that the bar side of the restaurant is more appropriate when dressed casually, but it's also very nice with warm dark wood and an intimate mood, as you can see in my photo.

They do take, and I definitely recommend, reservations, however we went on a Wednesday night, and they were able to squeeze our party of 5 into the casual side, and we also had the option of eating outside. No matter how busy they are, the waiters are always at ease and make you feel like you are their priority...the \"Italian way.\"

The pasta is made fresh daily, and the entrée portions are large. (See my photo of Chicken Parmesan with a side of pasta; that's HALF of an order, and they were HAPPY to split the order for us.) The Cannoli and Tiramisu are 100% authentic and amazing. I most definitely recommend the Tiramisu, especially since you can't get it this authentic at most other Italian restaurants. 

They also cater. I have no idea why I didn't think of them when we catered our last party. I'm obviously going to use them next time.

(They also have \"Brioni To Go\" next door with pizza, sandwiches, wings, etc.) We walked in that door by mistake once and saw some amazing New York style pizza being made, before we realized that we had gone in the wrong door, and they said so warmly, \"Just head through the hallway, here.\" (instead of telling us to go back outside and down to the next door) ~ Wonderful Italians, Wonderful Italian cuisine"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place but went here for a rehearsal dinner. I was pleasantly surprised. We sat on the back patio which was great and our waiter was fantastic. The antipasto was delicious, as was the bread and oil for dipping. I wasn't able to order my own food since there was such a large group which was unfortunate, but they served a wide variety of pizza, and it was all pretty tasty. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Italian food.  Their Veal Parm is amazing.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Italian and figured we would give this place a try. Wow, what a great decision. The food is amazing, I ordered the Chicken Gorgonzola and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer & Chicken Martini were out of this world delicious! We had dinner served family style for a group of 40. The food service was well coordinated & efficient. And the Brioni Boyz are never a disappointment!  ; )"}
{"text":"Decent Italian. Nothing more nothing less. Good service, and the staff was very friendly. Food was Eh, nothing that wowed or amazed me. I got the lasagna which was recommended to me by the waiter, and it was your average lasagna. A little too much cheese put on the top. Would most likely not return."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! HOWEVER...the Service was nonexistant! We arrived at 6:40PM 1/19/2013, we were told they didn't have our reservation for 6. They were able to seat us within 5 minutes on the heated patio. We were handed menus and then the Waiter dissappeared. Later on another waiter came and introduced himself as Mike and he would be taking good care of us. He took our drink order and we never saw him again. Later on the original Waiter came and said he'd help us out. He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted bread. They gave us all a warm roll and dissappeared again. We had no butter or dipping oil for the bread. One os our friends got up and fetched oild and vinegar from the waiter station. Later on the original waiter came back to take our order. When I said that I believe we were abandoned, he said that they were busier than usual and that I hurt his feelings. He took another drink  order but didn't return with them. Another 3rd waiter came back with our drinks about 20 minutes later. Our food was great but then it took another 30 minutes to get our bill. It took them 2 hours and 20 minutes to serve us from start to finish. The whole time, I watched to see how busy they really were and the poor service was due to disorganization. Not one women works there and I think that's a big part of their problem. Women would have been organized and efficient. These guys were all nice but not very on the ball and generally overwhelmed. I don't think it had to do with being busy (there were empty tables the whole time), just laziness and/or an inability to be organized and efficient. We won't go back again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and it's always been my favorite Italian restaurant in town. But my feelings skyrocketed to a whole new level when I sat and had dinner at the bar alone tonight. Laura, my beautiful bartender was not only a great server but very knowledgeable about the menu(because I tested her on it). 
A restaurant that has always focused on their male servers is getting a facelift! Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar with her. 
Pasta Brioni is a must try and must frequent!"}
{"text":"Place was friendly and accommodating.   I ordered the linguine pescatore. I like my pasta al dente, but the noodles were a bit under cooked. The broth was delicious. I wish they would of given me a spoon because I couldn't get enough of it. The shrimp, clams, and mussels were cooked perfectly. Expect some of the mussels were not cleaned properly. Other than that, food was good, Garyt and staff was awesome, wine was great, venue was clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! My dad and I go here all the time! My dad loves the pizza, I am gluten free and love the chicken caesar. They staff is so friendly and know us by name. They have a casual side, formal side and a deli/ togo area. So really whatever mood you are in you will fit in! : )"}
{"text":"We ate in the lounge and it was really good. I had the chicken Luca braise salad with grilled chicken. Vicki had spaghetti and meatballs and I tried a meatball very good. Mo had the calamari salad it had tons of calamari on it. Great portions.  Very quick and friendly service.  Overall really good spot if you are looking for good Italian food"}
{"text":"Pasta, pasta, pasta... Yes, please! 
I love their spaghetti and meatballs. Go there during happy hour and you will not be disappointed. It was a little warm in the bar area."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good, but let's face it ladies...if you've lived near downtown Scottsdale for a while, you've heard about the hot waitstaff.  They even had their own calendar for a couple years!  Sadly, on a recent birthday outing with 4 other girls, we were disappointed to find that the hot young boys were nowhere in sight (no offense to the fine waiters that do work there).  That's the real reason we chose Brioni's, as there are other places to get good Italian food if that's what you're after.  Granted, it may be that the boys had the night off for their other job with the Chippendales, but I doubt it.   We were there on a Friday night, and they seated us in a room I didn't know existed (the place is huge, with several rooms), not in the bar area where I'd had good times in the past.  The service was good, although the corner where we were seated smelled like old wood...?  It seems the crowd here has aged a bit as well..not that there's anything wrong with that...but it was more of the close to retirement set, rather than hot middle-agers like us!  Bottom line: still great food, good place to take visiting family around the holidays, but unfortunately the man candy is gone..."}
{"text":"Not really a fan. Service was ok. It was like they didn't have enough wait staff. We were literally trying to grab the waiter as he ran by. The food was ok. I'm sorry but I like Giuseppe's on 28th way better, much more authentic Italian taste (and I've been to Italy). Maybe it was because it was Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good choices on menu.  

We ordered the calamari-- not sure how you screw fried calamari up but Pasta Brioni managed to, in the fryer too long.

The pasta meals we ordered were decent.  Nothing great or special.  They handled a large group well though and the service was good.  Oh and the bread is really good too."}
{"text":"I am extremely happy with my first visit here !  I popped in for some help with placing a to go order and Kristin was absolutely awesome.  She was friendly, made suggestions to work with what I needed and went above and beyond.  What a great example of how customer service Should Be :)

Kristin you deserve a Christmas shout out and some goodies from the management !!!"}
{"text":"Still Excellent!  Mussels were super.  Linguini with clams and 4 cheese rigatoni delicious.  Needs better selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving! I was so excited when I ordered the penne vodka (my favorite) and when it arrived it looked perfect! My garlic bread was raw and doughy and the lettuce on my Cesar was old and wilted. The pasta was disappointing."}
{"text":"Very Very friendly staff.....Love their pasta dishes....Personally I am not a fan of the way they prepare their chicken HOWEVER many folks I went with loved it.."}
{"text":"Amazing Food. We liked it so much we came back the next night with some of our friends. Spinach and ricotta dumplings melt in your mouth, and everything from the chicken Parmesan to the beet salad was delicious.  Wonderful ambiance and reasonable prices. Great for every day dinner as well as out of town guests."}
{"text":"Been here many times over........ Where are the beautiful waiters go? service is ok but I was told they all went to Un Baccio....food is still ok but service with beautiful waiters made this place awsome....:("}
{"text":"I am sorry to give one star, but after the second attempt I can definitely say that the food is VERY DISAPPOINTING! 
I tried the chef salad and the quality was just low. Usually I am an indiscriminate eater, but this salad was just disgusting. 
Second time I ordered the rigatoni four cheese and a Caesar salad... The pasta doesn't even taste pasta. I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special.
I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it. I am sorry but I won't come back."}
{"text":"Excellent local italian restaurant. Fine establishment. Quality food and ambience. Love coming here all on my own just to chill and grab a glass of wine and great food. I had the mushroom ravioli this last week. It was to die for..real authentic and fresh home made pasta."}
{"text":"We ordered to go on a tues night and it took 1hr and 15 min. They had a tin of orders and we were told it would be that long. That being said, it was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken luccabratzi, which is a huge pounded out chicken breast with a salad on top. K had a pasta Primavera and added chicken. It was a huge portion with a ton on fresh vegetables. He also had a ceaser salad. It was all delivered hot and fresh. We loved it. $40 including tip. Not bad! Would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Pasta Brioni...what can I say? This place has some of the best eggplant parm that has ever passed through my lips! Mmm mmm mmm!

My boyfriend and I came here on a whim after another one of our fave Italin spots in Scottsdale (NY's Best Italian) closed and we were NOT disappointed!

It may not be the fanciest or most romantic place from a décor & lighting perspective, but the food is amazing and reasonably priced.

I did wish they had a bit more selection on the wine list but that's really a minor complaint.

I loved my eggplant and my man loved his shrimp scampi pasta. And we BOTH loved the yummy fresh bread. You have definitely NOT seen the last of us Brioni!"}
{"text":"Loved it. service was great, food was great . Medium pricey but for the food you can't complain."}
{"text":"As an Italian, I am picky to say the least. If you want good old school and authentic Italian this is the place!"}
{"text":"One word...DELICIOUS!!

When we walked in we were greeted by what I'm not sure was the owner, chef or both. But he had is white jacket on and was pretty involved with all of the tables pretty much the whole time. 

We ordered a veal bolognese and the chicken Parmesan. Both were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were huge!

Our server was extremely friendly and made some great suggestions for dinner! 

It's super casual but you could still wear something nice if you were feeling it. I will definitely return here. And next time I may share a dish so I can have some tiramisu.  

A must try!!"}
{"text":"Five of us had a really nice Monday lunch here, and practically had the place to ourselves, maybe because it's an all day menu?  Didn't see any lunch specials, but it didn't matter to us because we were looking for the main meal of our vacation day.  Note:  the bar side is open at lunch time.  If you come in the other side and see that it looks deserted like we did, just walk on through to the other side.

First, I have to say that the fresh warm rolls with a garlic herb butter are outstanding!  Especially paired with the house Chianti.  Yum!  Between the five of us we tried the Wedding Soup, the Eggplant Rollatini, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Chicken Parmesan (which also came with a salad and spaghetti), and Eggplant Parmesan (which came with spaghetti).

All of us were very happy with our meals!  Note:  the spaghetti is house made!  Everything is.  Even the wedding soup. I loved my eggplant parmesan as it was shaved eggplant, not breaded.  Lighter but with a good amount of cheesiness.   Portions are incredibly generous, which made for some sad waste, as we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room.

Ambiance has a dark old-school feel, which was just right for our purposes.  

Note:  Location is in the Old Town/Downtown Scottsdale area.  In a strip shopping center, quite close to the Aloft Hotel where we were staying.

Can definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Favorite Italian place in Scottsdale! Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Phoenix for the first time. This service is great. They accommodated 15 of my family members and we had the best time!"}
{"text":"Come here on girls night out.  You will not be dissapointed.  Hunky dark Italian servers aside, the food is excellent.  I think this might be some of the best italian food in the Valley."}
