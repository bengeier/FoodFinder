{"text":"My family & I have been visiting this Water & Ice Cream for a year & half. We have gotten to know Daniel the owner fairly well. Today I was on my way home & notice it had burned down between Saturday evening & today at 5pm.   My son who was with me was as shocked as I was! I hope you are ok Daniel! I hope you post your status Daniel!!  Thinking of you... Mint n chip & chocolate chip x 2, 1 scoop of rocky road, & cotton candy & rainbow sherbert."}
{"text":"Same owner from when he worked at 19th Ave and Indian School. Water is super fresh and the many flavors of ice cream are mouth watering! Great price for a hot dog, too :) Once you become a regular,  the owner will remember your face and, if you have the time, sit down and chat with you.  Love this place! 10/ 10"}
{"text":"Great customer service. 24 different flavors of Thrifty ice cream to choose from choice of waffle or plain cones yum! Clean water source and clean kept areas. EXCELLENT STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome food, stellar customer service, and great prices. They just started offering raw juices too. Try the Carrot-Cucumber-Apple-Ginger-Lemon juice combo. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"I love Thrifty Ice Cream but it tastes even better when served by someone sweet, pun intended. Run by nice folks, I used to frequent the 19th Ave & Indian School location but was literally run off by the shady strip mall creepers always lurking about. Now in a much better location, I hope the move pays off for them. Haven't used their water services but prices are good and service is friendly and helpful. Snacks and hotdogs are good too."}
{"text":"Sadly, this Water & Ice Cream store burned to the ground along with the adjoining stores.  The owner was always very nice and we will miss going each week to pick up some water, ice cream or fresh Juice.  Tragic for sure."}
{"text":"My husband I are love this place! Great milkshakes! Prices are wonderful. Water is convenient especially if you're filling up a bunch of water jugs. We come here regularly and the owner is sooo nice."}
{"text":"As far as water places go, this one is pretty fantastic.  The owner is very friendly.  They have Thrifty ice cream which is a big thumbs up when you want to be a little bad but they also have fresh raw juices and smoothies when you want to be a little good.  This is definately not your run of the mill water store and I go out of my way to visit this spot. :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great place to buy fresh raw juices and am so happy I found this gem!! The owner is extremely knowledgeable about what juices blend well together and what each one is beneficial for. I highly recommend checking this place out if you're looking for great quality juices at a very reasonable price! They even offer a juice stamp card for the frequent juicers. Super friendly service and I always leave with a smile. And if you're looking for delicious ice cream, you don't have to go any further... They have it all. :)"}
{"text":"I've never been a patron of the Water and Ice type places, but after stumbling into this place one day and trying their Thrifty's Ice Cream, i've become a weekly regular.    The owner is really cool and keeps the place clean and in good shape.   Try their snow cones and ice cream.  They don't skimp out on flavored syrup, and their ice cream is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is super dirty but that's my only complaint. The service is great, and the guy who is always there is friendly and super nice. It kind of feels like someplace out of the nineties. The ice cream is super delicious and you can eat like your at a baseball game without having to pay a bunch of money. Fun neighborhood spot to get water and snacks. :)"}
