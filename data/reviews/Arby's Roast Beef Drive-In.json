{"text":"I am a vegetarian and, therefore, cannot describe the majority of the Arby's menu. That being said, I basically live in the parking lot of this fine establishment and enjoy the occasional meatless snack. The curly fries are the potato product of dreams, and I have been known to make a large order my (rather unhealthy) lunch. The milkshakes are also delicious, especially the mint chocolate and Jamocha varieties. For a slightly more filling meal I opt for a large order of the delicious mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not the best person to write a review of Arby's as I'm generally not a fan of this place.  Whatever that substance they serve is not roast beef, I don't care what they say.  I can, however, eat my body weight in their curly fries.  This Arby's can definitely use a picker-upper.  It's run-down and dingy.  The staff members I've encountered don't seem too happy to be there (not that this surprises me).  If you're an Arby's fan, you might want to skip this particular establishment."}
{"text":"I'm not a fast-food fan, but my friend demanded I drive her here & get her greasy food.   (Yes, she was sober.)   The parking lot is just a disaster waiting for your car.  AVOID the pot-holes.  This Arby's looks like it needs a re-do.   And SLOW.  I mean like molasses S.L.O.W.  My friend wanted a small chix fingers combo.  I swear we were in the drive thru for 5-8 minutes.  It should not take that long!  After all, it is called FAST food.  Ugh.  No thanks Arby's"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, so it is important to me when I place my order for just fries that they come fresh. It is very hard to find a place that serves mostly fresh fries, but this place has proved to me time and time again that I can come back here. Also the people working here have always been friendly, or overly friendly."}
{"text":"The dirtiest Arby's I have ever seen!  I would suggest going to the one in Streetsboro, but that one is out of business. Don't eat here. Forget the roast beef sandwich and just go down the street to five guys for a hamburger, you'll be happy!"}
{"text":"I have to give the management staff here a gold star for their customer service. I had ordered their cheese sticks and mine weren't cooked all the way through, the staff gladly made me fresh ones immediately and were polite about it.   Whenever we use the drive -thru, the cashiers are always friendly and very accommodating. I know a lot of people look down on this specific location because it could use a face lift but the quality of food & friendly customer service more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed this place although I've been here a number of times!  This place is great and tries to help anyone with special dietary needs.  I had a friend who couldn't eat wheat products and they made her sandwhich on lettuce!  They have always gotten my order right, even the LARGE ones.  The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Has the big old hat sign.... how could I resist?  But in all seriousness, I love their roast beef. If I could afford a meat slicer and find whole things of it to cut myself I'd eat it every, single, day.  Curly fries are good, but go to eurogyro to get some jojos if you want better.  The milk shakes are also good.  This Arby's in particular has an apartment complex behind it, there are cars regularly going in and out so it's a little nightmarish sometimes."}
