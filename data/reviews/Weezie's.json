{"text":"I've been to Weezies once in the past and had a fantastic meal. Not sure what has changed in the past few years but my recent experience there leaves me not wanting to return.   My parents were in town, visiting me for only the third time in the 13 years of me living here. We decided to check out the Distillery Christmas market and I decided that Weezies would be a good place to eat, rather than the tourist trap Distillery restaurants. We managed to get a table for 5, arrived, ordered some drinks and ordered an app and mains. App: beef tartar. Mains: 4 flat iron steaks and 1 hamburger.   We waited about 30-40 minutes for the beef tartar (it's raw beef, what took so long?), finished it and thought our mains would be coming out right away. Wrong! We waited another 30 minutes for the steaks and burger. Was the restaurant busy? Yeah, but not crazy. And to top it all off, the portions of the steak were so small we all wondered if they ran out and some how managed to scrap these 4 plates together. All of this after my parents were talking about their last resto experience in which they waited forever, got very little, and paid out the arse for it. The irony was too much and it feels terrible when that happens.   During our 60+ minute wait for food our wait staff didn't once address the time issue even though it was pretty obvious we were waiting a long time. I've been a server in the past and if I knew a table would be waiting long I would let them know and bring some bread. That didn't happen.   The table beside us ordered just before us and were finished and out the door before we even received our mains. We joked about not getting out before midnight if we were to order some desert.   I felt so bad that I chose to bring my parents there seeing that they NEVER come to Toronto. I thought showing them a nice neighborhood restaurant would be nice, rather than a chain that they would normally choose. I felt so bad I picked up the entire bill myself and took them back to my place to eat a proper meal. My dad was going to pay as a congratulations meal for my fianc√© and me, but I could tell he couldn't bring himself to do it.   One of my biggest per peeves is feeling completely ripped off in a restaurant, which is what happened here. It didn't bother me this much the night of, but after I woke up the next day having had a dream of the experience I realized it must have really bothered me, and I've decided that it did. I had a dream of the experience! And I rarely remember my dreams!  The one saving grace was the food. It was good, and my mom thought her burger was good (the portion was fair), but it wasn't nearly good enough to look past the ridiculously long wait and ridiculously small portion size. I will not be returning nor recommending Weezies. Sorry."}
{"text":"An all round comfortable and tasty experience. Remarkable preparation of the escargots (flavours galore); nicely grilled steak, and those skinny amazing fries dipped in garlic mayo! A great 'date night' destination for us old married couples."}
{"text":"We visited last night, and I had a spectacular meal.  Chose the whole fish, a pan grilled Branzino, which was full of flavor and fantastic.  Finished with a toffee sticky pudding dessert, which was absolutely incredible.  Service was on the slow side, but the servers were nice and made up for it.  This place is a two minute walk from us, and absolutely recommended.  It reminded me of Batali's Lupa Ristorante in New York, only our Branzino last night was much, much better (in your face, Mario!)"}
{"text":"I'm perplexed by the reviews of this place. Is it supposed to be bistro or tapas style or what? Am I missing something. We've been wanting to go for long time as live in the area. Food was somewhat ok, but sort of what I would cook at home  but tiny, tiny portions. If it was stellar and tiny portions that's one thing. But this reminded me of an ariplane tray dinner, yes it was that small and really not that much better. Nothing really impressed. Other than cozy ambience. My friend had the macaroni and cheese, looked like a toddler portion and we were laughing as the side salad which was one tiny piece of raddichio and a tiny piece of green baby lettuce, and by piece I mean it looked like two little scraps from someone's salad had fallen onto her plate. between us all we had frites, devilled eggs, shrimp po boys, burger, pappardelle, frisee salad and various desserts. Everything we had was just mediocre and again, tiny. we left hungry. went home and ate toast and honey.....definitely would not go back. For the price, size and quality will stick to Foxley's which is one of our favourite small plate type restaurants."}
{"text":"Really good food, good service, good prices.  I've been a few different times, and I've never been disappointed.  The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is that the menu doesn't tend to change, and it's fairly short to begin with, so I haven't had much reason to keep going."}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews, I was disappointed that my recent trip was an unpleasant one. The combination of a mixed-up order and inattentive service made for an unpleasant dinner.   The overall service was slow and inattentive. We were on a timeline, having to leave in a little over an hour and a half for another event. We didn't mention this to the server as it seemed a reasonable length to plan for and didn`t want to rush them, but we ended up having to scarf down our mains because the appetizer and main course preparation was very slow, to the point where we were sitting around for quite some time after ordering and between courses. Perhaps the team should consider hiring a sous chef to speed things up a little.  The quality of the appetizers was quite good, so no complaints there.  For the mains, I and another person in our group of 5 ordered the burger, cooked medium. When our mains were served, his was announced as a medium burger, while mine was simply a burger.   I didn't clue in to the difference immediately, but soon found out that mine was cooked well done. I would have sent it back, except that our server didn't come back to the table for the rest of the meal, and because of the slow service I would have had to just leave without eating anything if I had sent it back. I did tell the host/busboy that my burger was not as I had ordered, who I think then went behind the bar to tell the server. He seemed unconcerned by the mistake, and didn't stop chatting with his friends at the bar. At no point during the meal did anyone ask us how we found things - something you take for granted except when there`s an issue. It almost seemed like the server was avoiding us because he knew my order was messed up.   I can understand that mistakes happen, but it was pretty clear to all that my meal was not correct and yet nothing was done about it. Suffice it to say that I won`t be going back."}
{"text":"So, so good. I had the Steak Frites and they were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Probably one of the best Toronto meals I have had. I saw someone else eating the Mac and Cheese and am anxious to try it next..."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Weezie's for a few years. Always have a great dinner, good wine selection and the service has been quite satisfactory. Love this small, cozy neighborhood haunt."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place.  It's completely hidden away at the North-East corner of King and Parliament - I had never noticed it and in fact STILL had difficultly locating it even when I was recommended to go there and make a reservation.  It's dark, romantic and atmospheric inside - probably as formal a restaurant as you'd get outside of the downtown core. The staff were fantastic - our server was laid-back but really efficient and very friendly while still being totally sincere. We were able to speak to the chef and she was delightful!  The steak I ordered was the best I ever had, hands down. It was juicy and tender and not in the slighest bit overdone or charred even thought I asked for it well done. The fries were also gorgeous.  My dad was just as impressed with his steak (as well as his seafood starter which he ate in seconds!), and my mum was raving about her burger, which came with a generous assortment of toppings, as well as the same skinny peppered fries that I had.   The desserts were mouthwatering and there was a wide range of unique sweet treats to choose from. I settled for some sort of chocolate concoction (not sure what as it has been a few weeks since my visit) and couldn't get enough!   It isn't cheap, but well worth the money for the service, food quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great spot - and as others have mentioned, it blends in very well to the building making it almost unnoticeable. We very much enjoyed the octopus, beet salad and the fish mains. Great presentation, well cooked, absolutely nothing to complain about. Only thing I would mention is that we felt a bit rushed by the server (who other than that was great), even though the restaurant was not busy. For instance there was no timing between appetizer and mains and she went to remove a plate plate whilst one was still eating."}
{"text":"When my friend suggested we make reservations at Weezie's, I was most certain that we were going to eat at a diner. A fancy diner that takes reservations, for real!   Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed how spacious the room was in comparison to many restaurants I've eaten at on the same strip. I appreciate having enough personal space when I'm dining so that I don't feel like I'm rubbing shoulders with my neighbours, and this was just that.  My friend and I started with 2 Apps: The Salmon Rillette, and Asparagus.   The Rillette was light and fresh, with the accompanying crostini providing the perfect amount of crunch. This is something I would order again. Translation: Someone get me a tub of Rillette stat!  While somewhat pedestrian, the Asparagus was good in preparation. They still had a bit of crunch, and had a nice charred flavour from the grill.   For mains, my friend had the Burger and Frites, while I had the Pappardelle.  Though my friend rarely eats red meat, I could tell that she really enjoyed what was in front of her. She demolished that bad boy like it was nobody's business. You go girl!  I borrowed a couple of Frites from her plate, and they were easily some of the best I've had in the city. Thin, and crispy with a lovely tarragon salt coating them. Just perfect.  The Pappardelle was simple but delicious. A true testament to the quality of the ingredients used in preparation. The grape tomatoes added just enough acidity to contrast the olive oil based sauce, while the pine nuts added a lovely contrast in texture amongst the ribbons of perfectly, and I mean perfectly Al Dente pasta.  My only feedback would be that as a main, the pasta was not substantial. I found that I had to pace myself so I wouldn't  finish before my friend.   However you can tell that the Kitchen really cares about what they're putting out there based on the execution of these dishes. I would definitely come back when they've rotated their menu!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here in this intimate king east spot.   The atmosphere is laid back and the service is efficient without being too over bearing. Had an app, salad two mac and cheese entrees and a bottle of wine for $110 tax and tip included.   The highlight of the meal was certainly the mac and cheese. It was creamy yet well baked with a solid layer of cheese and bacon strewn throughout. It is as good a version as I have tried in any restaurant though I have yet to try Caren's in Yorkville.  Another nice touch is that the cook/owner personally runs the food to the table and discusses the  plate with the customer. A nice touch!  Good place for a nice meal in a fairly romantic setting."}
{"text":"Yummy - I really love this cozy place!!  All 6 of us ordered the Frize salad as a starter.  It's a salad with bacon and a poached egg.  Not just any poached egg, one that is covered with tempura batter!!!  So cool, I've never had such a tasty egg.  A friend of mine had it two weeks earlier and we're all sure glad we listened to her!  For my main course, I ordered the Mac n Cheese.  I do love gourmet Mac n Cheese and opt to order it instead of Steak on many many occasions.  This one definitely didn't disappoint.  Their choice of cheese, not sure what it was but it was really good.  Also had bacon in it.  I couldn't finish it all, but did have an extra stomach for dessert.  Everyone else ordered steak and fries or scallops and oxtail which were also very delicious.  I finished off the night with the pecan pie.  It was a good ending to a perfect meal.  The restaurant definitely read my mind of my all time favourite comfort foods with new tasty twists.  Next time I'm in Toronto, I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment given the positive feedback about this place. Definitely not recommending. We went for dinner last night - I ordered the steak frites. As per the menu (and the dish itself), it comes with garlic aioli dip - which for me is what I happened to be craving. Dish came - no garlic aioli. Once the server came back around, we asked her for some. She looked puzzled - went to the kitchen and returned a minute later and told us there was none but the cook could \"make some\" but that my \"steak would get cold waiting\". Will not return. Would not recommend to any of my friends. Bad service. Food was ok at best."}
{"text":"Ate at Weezie's last night for the 4th and last time.  Showed up at 5:40 with my husband and 4 year old son for a quick bite before my son's bed time.  We needed to leave by 6:45 so I didn't bother telling them we were on a \"tight schedule\" as we were the only ones in the restaurant when we arrived and I figured an hour would be ample time, knowing from previous visits that the Mac n' Cheese can get to the table mere minutes after ordering.  5:45 we've ordered and it isn't until 6:20 that our apps arrived.  Then, at 6:30 when our food still hadn't arrived - I tell our server that we'll have to leave shortly and she tells us it's on it's way out.  6:35 I tell the server to please cancel my salad (I didn't want to scarf it down).  She tells me, quite rudely, that I should have told her we were on a \"tight schedule\".  SERIOUSLY??!? We were the only table when we arrived and there were only 2 others by the time I told her not to bother with my salad.  Three minutes later she brought my husband's Mac n'Cheese along with the bill.  No apology, just dirty looks.  I enjoy a leisurely dinner as much as the next person but not with a four year old in tow on a Tuesday night.  Never going back and it's just around the corner from me.  So rude.  And the food is just meh."}
{"text":"Not sure why, but I forgot to review this when we went back in December. If it was a bad review, I'd have left it alone, but since it's glowing, I figured it was still valid, even if it is two and a half months late.  I'm afraid I don't have all of the details fresh in my mind, but I can simply say that if you've never been, you've got to try it!   We were a pretty big group (eight), and everything we tried was spectacular! You can tell that the chef truly cares about her dishes as you can really taste the love.  I had the Mac and Cheese, and my only complaint was that there wasn't enough. For the price and quality, it was certainly a fair portion, but it was so good, I was left wanting more!  The service is also terrific, the room is super-cozy, and the location make you feel that you've found a hidden treasure... which in many respects it still is!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the vibe of the place was great. Very small dining area but it added to the ambience and charm. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the food, which our group and myself were highly disappointed with after all the rave reviews on Yelp.   We had a large group (over 8 people) and ordered a variety of items on the menu.  The flat iron steak was delicious and very well cooked and seasoned. Everything else ordered was overly salted, to the point that our meals could not be finished. The mac and cheese, frites and pappardelle were some of the items that were extremely salty. We mentioned the saltiness to our waitress and the response was that's what it should taste like. There was no attempt to rectify our complaints or acknowledgement that there was something wrong with the food.   Unfortunately I cannot say that anyone in our group or myself would return or recommend Weezie's to others. Which is very disappointing as I live in the neighbourhood and as mentioned before had very high hopes and expectations."}
{"text":"Always wanted to check out Weezie's. it's always been a big mystery to me. No website....blinds usually down...  So I finally checked it out the other day and I wasn't really impressed.   The service was great. Our waitress was fun and attentive and always available to answer all the silly questions we had about the menu.   The menu - kinda weird. It's basically tapas but not clearly defined. They've got bigger tapas items and smaller ones so we weren't entirely sure how much we should order (queue the helpful waitress yet again).   The food was tasty but not that impressive. I don't even remember what we had (which I guess isn't a good thing). I remember having asparagus with an egg on top that was overlooked :-(  Glad I went but I don't really have a burning desire to go back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have had a meal in Toronto where the first bite has made me stop cold. The food is that good. As others have noted, it's in a bit of an out of the way location, and the atmosphere inside is cosy and dark. It's the perfect first date spot.  I had the trout, which was perfectly cooked and flavoured.  I was curious what warm potato salad would be like (the accompaniment) but it suited the dish perfectly. My dining companion only had good things to say about her steak frites. We indulged in dessert -- creme brul√©e with a hint of thyme for her, butterscotch pot de cr√®me for me -- and again, same reaction for both, Just heavenly.  Service was attentive in the good way. Weirdly though, it was packed when we arrived just after 6, but was it was sparsely filled afterwards. Not a complaint -- more attention for us! -- but a comment.   **Note, they are cash or debit only!"}
{"text":"This place was so good.  Their fried whitefish was divine.  The seasoning is in the batter and it is so light and crispy.  The burger was also probably the best burger I have had in the city.  Scallops were cooked to perfection.  The only downside was that they barely had any wine left.  We pretty much had to choose between two of the whites they had left... Also, we were the only table in the entire restaurant which felt a little odd initially but the food was so great that the feeling quicky subsided."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a fairly large group and we were all pretty impressed.  This is a very small restaurant in Corktown. I'm not all that familiar with the neighbourhood, but it's easy to get to since there's lots of parking and the streetcar runs right in front of the building.  Some of the appetizers are a bit different. I had the corn dogs, which hit the spot, but it wasn't anything too amazing as it really was just mini corn dogs with ketchup and mustard.  My main was pretty great though. I had the steakfrites, and the steak was very tender and the fries and garlic dip really hit the spot.  I would have probably only gone with 3.5 stars if the service wasn't so good, but our server was exceptionally accommodating.  There is only bottled beer, but they have Mill Street Organic, Steamwhistle, Keith's, and I think a few others, so it's adequate. The wine list is limited and they can make basic cocktails."}
{"text":"I am so proud to have such a great resto near my hood.  Came here for a girl's night.  We were greeted warmly and got our drinks quickly.  It is nice and cozy, totally not what I expected from looking outside.  We started with fries and devilled eggs.  A1 for both.  Then we upped the ante by ordering addictive Mac and cheese that melts in your mouth and is perfumed with truffle oil.  One of the best that I have had and as such I ordered another plate.  As an entree I had the steak and frites.  Luscious and flavourful, a really good cut of meat.  I was totally sated & I loved every bite of it.  My girlfriends had the burger and they were moaning and groaning how it was the best burger that they have had.  The wine we had paired really well with our meal.  I left the restaurant on a cloud knowing that I am just a hop, skip and a jump away from a great meal that my tummy loves."}
{"text":"Weezie's is a gem of a neighborhood bistro located in Corktown. It's dimly lit at night-not a bad place if you will to go for a date or have a dinner with friends. Very dark hues inside, a minimalist decor.   I've had the burger here, it was nicely grilled and tasty and served with some crispy fries. Service was kind and attentive and their wine list is short but has decent mark-ups. Dessert was limited to profiteroles and cookies when I went.   It's a small bistro with a limited menu but everything is executed well and I hear they have a mac n cheese to die for so I will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Weezy's is definitely one of the best, and most authentic Canadian restaurants in the city. All the food produced from this cozy Corktown kitchen exceeds its pretty appearance with its taste, and reveals more dimensions as you eat each bite than suggested by their individual aroma.  As they are well known for, fish is cooked and salted perfectly. On my last visit I enjoyed the devilled quail eggs, the tomato soup of the day, and the lamb pie. All were examples of hidden ingredients revealing themselves to create diverse and exciting dishes.  Very nice, attentive service. If ever in the neighbourhood its definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"We had enough of the Distillery and were wondering about aimlessly until we came upon this gem.  Boy, were we lucky.  We seated ourselves at the bar right when they opened the doors for dinner.  We were the first ones in, and the place was packed when we left a little over an hour later.  The bartender/server was amazing and guided us through the menu.  She got us started with some wine before moving on to food - super friendly.  The mac and cheese was stellar . . . I mean stellar!  The bread pudding was also superlative.  This stop on our Toronto food crawl will have to be revisited!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Four years ago is when it all started. Searching for a restaurant for a friends birthday I came upon a short review on Toronto Life for Weezies. Wanting to be on the west end, my friends opted for not and Weezies became a fading dream. As the years continued I would dig my brain for the name of the restaurant, but could only remember their famous, talked about mac and cheese appetizer. It wasn't until a little over a year ago the name popped up again and I yearned to go there; so many years of pent up expectations. But still, night after night other restaurants won the bill and Weezies was left to almost become another distant, faded memory...Until last week my partner picked me up from work and we wanted to see a movie at Scotiabank. As we went through the list of restaurants in the area nothing was resonating, until I remembered the restaurant hugging the corner of Power and King...a true hidden gem by it's real definition.   I was beyond excited. The ambiance is sensual and sultry. Dark wood aligns the wall and splatters of red highlights are somewhere and every in between. The booths used to be lined with a black snake print design, but it's seen better days. Perhaps just a sign of a constant flow of patrons fighting for a table. I found the middle of the restaurant to be a bit stark. Don't get me wrong, I hate when tables are squeezed in for maximum profit, but something felt cold within this warm palette.   On to the food. We started with the fried white fish and tarter sauce. A take on fish and chips. I really enjoyed the tarter sauce and the fish was delicate and had a subdued flavor. It wasn't anything spectacular but good enough to finish them all.   I ordered the tagliatelle. I think there were pistachios, some chanterelle mushrooms and roasted tomatoes in a slightly spicy oil. A pungent French cheese was oozing between the noodles. I wasn't very impressed. Portion size was fair but the tagliatelle wasn't home made and the dish could have used more roasted tomatoes. Every bite the flavor would stop short. My partner ordered the burger which looked so good - too bad I don't eat meat. Everyone raves about it and I can see why. The french fries are just like the skinny ones you'd get in a French bistro is Paris. My partner was tempted to slap my hand, as I was focusing more on his dish than mine.  I couldn't figure it out. Why wasn't I blown away? Were my expectations too high? Did I set myself up for failure? Then I looked across my table and noticed the chef wasn't in the kitchen tonight. She was chatting with other diners. It was her night off! Overall, I wouldn't put Weezies in my top restaurants. I did like the ambiance and I would consider going again on a night when the chef is actually cooking. I've built this one up for too long to just let it actually become a faded memory."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Everything's good....but if you want great, order the burger. Best burger I've had in the city. Nothing else comes close. I've heard Harbord Room tops it just slightly...but I've yet to try it."}
{"text":"Simple menu doesn't mean simple tastes, and Weezie's proves this point. Every morsel of food was perfectly seasoned, and tasted like how, I would assume, the chef wanted it too. Starting with the complementary bread (note you have to ask for the bread - it doesn't come automatically) that were thin slices of a fresh baguette roll that was crusty on the outside and soft and chewy inside, I knew the meal was going to be great.   For an app I ordered the beef patties, which were three small homemade patties that were done perfectly. The pastry was flaky and the filling was not of a beef mush variety and had just enough curry flavour to leave my palate wanting more. Note: don't expect the spice level to be like those of the corner store variety - think tamed down Canadian spicy.   Then my entree really stole the show. Ordered the steak frites, which was seasoned without-a-single-extra-grain-of-salt perfect and grilled to medium-rare bursting with flavour and juices with every bite.   To finish I ordered the malva pudding. Believe me the app and steak were more than enough for me but from the reviews of their desserts I couldn't resist. The pudding looked saccharine sweet but don't let appearances fool you, as like every other dish at Weezie's, it was just right.   Five stars for food but I had to deduct one star for the slow service. But the waitress was very nice and made the dining experience an amazing one.   Try this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to !!!! Quiet and quaint little restaurant. Doesn't have a lot of tables so make reservations. The steak frites and Mac n cheese are to die for, I order them every time because I can't give them up. Literally the best steak ever !!!!!"}
{"text":"Exploring Corktown one evening with my friend, we found Weezie's through our trusty Yelp app :D Funny how I pass by this restaurant A LOT OF TIMES, and I don't even notice it! But I'm so glad we discovered this \"hidden\" gem :)  It is a small cozy restaurant, good for dates or a causal night out with friends. Be sure to make reservations! Our lady server was excellent, very attentive and service was very smooth throughout the evening. She mentioned that the chef changes menu items every 3-4 weeks or so, and enjoys experimenting & creating new dishes with local ingredients :) So, be sure to swing by and check out their most updated menu posted in front of the restaurant!  We ordered small appetizers to share - these minature goodness are packed with powerful flavours! :) Simple menu yet extraordinary taste!  Devilled quail eggs - *MUST TRY* Steak Tartare with grilled baguette Large order of Mac n' Cheese with astiago, parmesan, and bacon! Whitefish sticks #crispy Pan fried sardines - my friend's favourite :P  Thanks, Weezie's - we enjoyed our evening :) Can't wait to come back to try more creations!"}
{"text":"I had the escargot appetizer, I couldn't resist having not seen it on a menu for years, they were big, plumb and loaded with butter and garlic, excellent. Then I had the steak and frites. Steak was nicely done and the fries were ok.   I walked in off the street on a whim for an early Sat. dinner when there was only one other table occupied. Within 15 minutes the place was full, so unless you're going very early call ahead"}
{"text":"Here is yet another place I have passed a thousand times but never stopped into that is, until last night.  I have always been curious because the ambiance from the outside looks for lack of a better word, seductive.    Inside the place was a little more spartan than what I was expecting, but still pleasant.  Like my partner in eating crime suggested, I too appreciate the spaciousness of the tables. The music was bold and got a bit louder as the night went on but was never intrusive.  I take issue with the fact that the men's washroom is nicer than the ladies'.  LOL!  Yep, I looked in both because I was curious about the exposed brick in the dudes' loo.  Let's start by saying that I was hungry having done hours of yard work earlier!!!  I did enjoy the salmon rillette but as usual when I order any dish similar to this, I would have liked a little more bread.  I like to spread the goodness out more.  I really enjoyed the asparagus too.  The meat in the burger was awesome!  So tender and juicy; it was almost like tartare.  My only beef with the burger was the bottom half of the bun became hella soggy and I don't like that.  The frites were good too though I swear to Dog they tasted a bit like Chinese five spice.  Guess it was the tarragon giving them a slight aniseed flavour.  All in all, it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Big fan of Weezie's.   It is not well known and that's part of it's charm; heard about it from a co-worker and could not believe it's been in my neighborhood for three years and I haven't tried it, so i did...promptly.  As far as a casual hood bistro, I can't ask for anything more. Great friendly service (discussed the evolution of the neighborhood in depth with the server), excellent food quality for the price, and a chic but comfortable atmosphere.   I have heard legendary tales about the steak tartare, and great things about the escargots, scallops, and burger but didn't get to try them. My fault as we got there for the last reservation past 9pm, but they were out of a few items. That said, between the two of us we got to try the frisee salad, sardines, mac'n'cheese, and steak frites. All great, with the mac'n'cheese being the standout.   No harm done though;  I will be back, many times over, and will run through that menu eventually. And when I do, if the food stacks up to what it's said to be I may just have to upgrade it to 5 stars.  In the meantime just remember: they run out of items, even on a weeknight, so go early. At least if makes me feel confident in the freshness of the food since it suggests they seem to buy supplies on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Amazing Corktown bistro known primarily for their burger - it's a house specialty, perfectly cooked, topped with thick slice of bacon on a delicious bun.    Don't forget their dijon mustard - clears the sinuses but goes amazingly well with the hand cut fries.  Comfort food in an upscale bistro atmosphere.  The chicken is a safe bet, as are the daily or weekly specials they have on the menu.  Lunch menu is even better as the burger (without bacon I believe) is (more )reasonably priced.  Service is generally quite attentive.  It's a small cozy space, which can fill up, so its generally not a bad idea to call ahead if you are making dinner plans there.  Highly recommended - great spot in the city - close to the Bayview extension, DVP and Gardiner.   A must try if you are in the area, and worth the drive if you aren't.  I just hope it doesn't get *too* popular...."}
