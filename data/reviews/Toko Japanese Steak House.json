{"text":"This place was ok. I was surprised to see and all you can it sushi place. I was a bit put off by the we will charge you for what you don't eat. I understand but if it a piece or two c'mon. Some of the tuna look a bit (fishy) no pun intended. It was ok sushi. The all you can it was really a bargain when the one specialty roll I wanted was 13.95 although it was not included on the all you can it there was a good selection. I would it there again."}
{"text":"Originally I really liked this place and came all the time, because the food was great, but I just had a horrible customer service experience. I ordered the pad Thai from the menu and it wasn't labeled as spicy. When I got the dish it burned my mouth up and I can't stand spicy food makes me very nauseous. So I told the waitress I would like it refunded considering I didn't eat any of it and never on the menu did it say the pad Thai was spicy. She looked stressed out and confused and went to call the \"owner\" and said that he cannot refund my meal because I ordered it. Whatever I order I have to pay for. This place has no respect for customers who are loyal, I have never sent anything back. Any other place would have just refunded the food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Hibachi is delicious, and you can't beat the all you can eat sushi deal! I've been warned though about not eating everything you order when doing the sushi special."}
{"text":"This is the best all you can eat sushi place I have been to. And trust me I have been to tons. The fish quality beats that of expensive restaurants. Best bang for your buck. You gotta order responsibly or you'll get charged for wasting food, which is how they keep the costs low. Loved it. You will NOT regret it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The sushi is always fantastic and so fresh. It's great for lunch because the staff is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends for the All You Can Eat deal. While it sounded great on paper, it's actually a huge waste of money. \"For $19.99, you get to eat all the delicious sushi you want, how can that be bad?\" you ask.  Well, at Toko if you are doing the AYCE deal, you are basically eating plates and plates of rice decorated with cucumbers and a little not-so-fresh fish on top. What I ate was NOT sushi. I looked at the table next to us, who were not getting AYCE and their sushi looked like real sushi. It feels like we are being treated as second class citizens just because we chose the wrong promotion the restaurant offers.   I came here around 7pm on a Thursday and the restaurant was mostly empty. Only 4 tables of people. However it still took 30 mins for our sushi to came out while the 2 sushi chefs were just idling. I assume this is because we got some miso soup and salad as appetizers and they want to make sure we feel like we are half full by the time our sushi came out. My friend who sat facing the chefs said they did not start making the rolls until they saw we finished our appetizers.   While i understand why they chose to stuff the sushi with tons of rice and delay the arrival of food (so we can be full faster and eat less real fish), I hated my experience here. I will NEVER come back and I will tell all my friends the same (whom all love sushi).   I've been to AYCE sushi restaurants all over the country and this place is the worst by far. Note to the restaurant owner: This is no way to do business. No true sushi lovers would return a second time hence the empty restaurant. If you had given us better sushi, I would've been a regular and brought so much business to you. Yes, the per person earning for the restaurant would be less, but if the restaurant was full of patrons, you would still be making way more money than 4 tables a night. Or...just don't offer AYCE if you don't indeed on having return patrons.  I almost never complain about food, but this experience have left me angry and not feeling well after eating so much rice.    Also all the silly rules about charging us extra $$ for leaving rice and others also make this an awful experience. you feel like you are being judged by what you eat. I never waste food and being told multiple times I would be charged if I don't finish everything before I even start eating makes me feel like i'm being treated like a criminal.   Do they have decent sushi if you had just ordered a la carte? I have no idea. They could be making amazing sushi but definitely not for the All-You-Can-Eat"}
{"text":"I tried this place out based  on the reviews. The service was good and waiter was very friendly.  I did not have the all you can eat sushi, however  I ordered two rolls, the first  was ok, but the spicy  tuna had so much filler Japanese breading that it was not ettiable. I mentioned this to the waiter after I ate one piece, and he response  was ya they do that so people who don't like raw sushi can eat it!"}
{"text":"When to Tokyo sat at bar bartender Rick was very helpful recommended sushi for me it was great I wasn't sure I would like it but I did drink was awesome also will come bake to see Rick again"}
{"text":"This place is the opposite of what it looks like on the outside. Interior is beautiful and food is very good. Had the coconut chicken lunch special, and it was very good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  I had the sashimi appetizer and edamame.  My boyfriend had the chicken and steak hibachi.  Service was fast and the food was great.  I would definitely come back when I am in town.  Afterwards, we sat at the bar and had a drink before a movie and the bartender was friendly and entertaining!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The sushi is good, the wait staff is attentive, and the all you can eat menu is very nice.  It can be a little slow (don't expect to be in and out in under an hour) but we are fine with that given how good the food is"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a great sushi place since we moved away from our favorite in 2010. No joke. We finally found it! Don't let the outside fool you; the inside is clean and wonderfully decorated. The waitress was so helpful and prompt. The rolls I ordered were the soft shell crab and the California. Both were delicious! I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wasnt the best sushi i have ever had but service was ok they were alittle over attentive with watching us eat.  Inside was alittle like ponderosa still not unacceptably gross not pristine."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come and check out this new japanese steak house in kent. Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing. We paid almost $60 and still left hungry.  Shumai was baby sized and definitely not authentic. The scallion pancake was greasy. Hibachi = way too overpriced. We ordered chicken shrimp hibachi and New York strip steak hibachi. Costs about $20 each and tasted average. You can get the same stuff in any Chinese restaurant for a much lower price and bigger portions. Tbh, this is just another Ming Cheng but with sushi. Why the heck would I pay $60 if I wanted some $20 worth average joe American Chinese food?! Funny they call it Japanese steak house lol what a joke.  Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently really, really excellent. The decor inside is nice, the service very friendly and attentive, and the food, great! I've been a number of times and I always been very impressed. A great favourite is the Hibachi diner. For well under $20 it is a feast. Soup, salad and a delicious main course. In Streestboro there is definitely a lack of good eating options, but this is a true diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"We have lived in Streetsboro for years and finally gave Toko a try last night,  and we were very pleasantly surprised! The location is not what you would expect, but the decor I found to be inviting inside and the wait staff was helpful and attentive. We had no issues booking a table for 13 on new years eve!   The menu: I have to say the menu was a bit intimidating. We went with a friend who had been there before so he helped explain it to us. Basically for $19.95 you get unlimited soup,  salad and appetizers, as well as unlimited selections of sushi. There are some limits on single serve sushi options as well as sashimi. For $3 you can add an entire hibachi meal, $5 for premium hibachi meats like filet mignon or lobster.  The wait staff will pretty forcefully guide you to order a small amount at first. Our waitress told one girl in our group to try just noodles instead of noodles and rice. To me it was not rude,  more so helpful, but I could see how it could put some people off. To discourage waste, the menu does indicate an up charge for wasted food. This means if you order it, you better eat it, so take their advice and order small at first... You can always get more later!   The food: Very good! Tasty small portions of appetizers, soup and salad were great. The sushi is pretty good quality and lots of options! Hibachi filet was cooked a perfect rare and vegetables of onion and squash were seasoned perfectly!   It's all you can eat with some safeguards against wasting food, which should be embraced at more restaurants if you ask me. Great quality and staff, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"T Despite the humble exterior, this place is pretty amazing! The sushi has got to be some of the best I've ever had. And they had plenty of options, so all of our kids were able to find something they like to eat."}
{"text":"5 stars is ridiculous but I LOVE THIS PLACE!! This place is definitely underrated as well and unknown which is great because you get amazing service but we definitely need to spread the word about this place. Service is great. Sushi is AMAZING. Hibachi is so GOOD. I work in the service industry and have no complaints what so ever. My co workers and I go here weekly, sometimes twice a week! Keep it up and get your name out more!"}
{"text":"Lived in Streetsboro for over 15 yrs and never ate here until today.  Why did we wait so long?  Food was delicious - the filet mignon was tender and juicy.  My daughters got the tira misu for dessert and the pieces were quite large.  Brought some leftovers home as well.  We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Toko! It's the best. The sushi is some of the best in the area and the hibachi is delicious. It comes with soup and salad which all come out very quickly. It is less expensive than most hibachi restaurants but just as great. The green tea Mochi is a must try, even if you are super full! All of the servers are awesome, very efficient and kind."}
{"text":"Always great food every time I come here. Great service. Never gonna stop coming here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal. There was a good selection of sushi(the only thing I ate), presentation was carefully detailed, everything seemed to be clean also. The all-you-can-eat is very reasonable at $20, a little heavy on the rice for the \"sushi\"(normally called nigiri) orders but overall a great deal.  Plus,  this is the only sushi place that I've been to that offers sashimi(4 piece limit) with all-you-can-eat!  The only hiccup was the time it took for food to be delivered to our table. It was a Thursday night and we had a party of 7, maybe to much for them to handle idk.  I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"This was mine and my girlfriends favorite place for drinks and sushi but it seems they closed this location. I do believe there is still another in Kent but very sad to see it go. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I liked the lunch special for sushi. It was like 8 dollars or something for a giant plate of sushi. it's basically giant eagle quality. but who cares. grocery stores charge like 12 bucks for half of what I got at TOKO.  Worth it IMO at the right time of day if you order the right stuff. Max out on the Nigiri, order a few other rolls, and BAM can't beat the price."}
{"text":"I checked out this place for lunch and it was great. I was greeted when I walked in. The atmosphere is simple and set up with rows of booths. I didnt go to far in so I can't speak for the rest of the place.   I typically don't eat sushi but I tried their fire dragon roll with eel sauce. It was stuffed with shrimp and crab meat and topped with avocado. It was so delicious that I could have eaten more.  The customer service was great. I didnt have to wait too long for my food. Overall, a nice little place for something different."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise! Food was good, waitresses are very nice but slow service. We had sushi and hibachi, loved both. We will return again for sure :)"}
{"text":"Update: I have since been here 3 more times. We have ordered different things every time, and I have yet to be disappointed by a single thing. I also forgot to mention before that 1) the service is flawless and expedient and 2) the place is gorgeous on the inside; don't be put off by its location in a Streetsboro strip mall. I'm serious, this place is great in every way! I can't wait until they open the bar up, because the only thing they're missing is sake."}
{"text":"The food itself was very good. But I'm deducting two stars for the fact that they don't serve ginger sauce at the hibachi.   This is a deal breaker for me.  Ginger sauce is the highlight of my Japanese steakhouse experience and I was sadly disappointed to not have it.  Call me if you serve it in the future because I would definitely come back.  But I need my ginger."}
{"text":"Not open yet!   Phone forwards to Kent, which would have been good to know for my carryout order..."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible place, fake Japanese food, very small portion and overpriced. The only good thing is the friendly waitress. I m never going back there."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect it by the location but the sushi menu is vast, well prepared, and delicious!  We found this place about 2 years ago and keep going back since."}
{"text":"I do not care for this Chinese buffet. Their selection isn't that great, their food is never very fresh, and everything taste like pepper! Well, 90% of the time it taste like pepper. It seems like every once in a while someone else does the cooking. Given that the food is not impressive to begin with I wouldn't bother trying to find a non-pepper day.- sorry, this was meant for Evergreen buffet and now they won't let me delete it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. They have a great all you can eat menu that includes appetizers, sushi, sashimi, hibachi, etc. The sushi is outstanding, the restaurant is very clean, and the service has always been good."}
{"text":"Traveling through town and a co-worked found this place on YELP, so we figured we'd give it a try. As we pulled up, the outside of the restaurant made me a little nervous, closed vertical blinds and loads of neon lights, but I threw caution to the wind and said whatever! You enter the restaurant into a small reception area that is very small and awkwardly decorated. But, we continued on the journey and ventured through the double doors leading into the restaurant. And, before we knew it we were standing in the middle of a beautifully decorated and amazingly large restaurant! The staff greeted us and we took a table in the middle of the restaurant. The large menu was a little complicated at first and the \"All You Can Eat\" buffet was riddled with restrictions and limitations. I ended up playing it safe with a simple California Roll and Edamame, which was really fresh and satisfying. My friends opted for the All You Can Eat Buffet and seemed happy with everything! All in all, not a bad dinner for the price. This experience was definitely a case of don't judge a book by its cover. So, when in Streetsboro, Ohio, be sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was relaxed and inviting. Great food and specials, and good dessert too. Best Rangoon I have ever had...."}
{"text":"Recent visit was FANTASTIC! I ate my heart out, service was good with a newer waitress and I left with a full belly. Seriously, what more can you ask for. I got unlimited sushi with the rice and noodles, spring rolls, and 5 orders of Chicken Tampora, 2 Green Dragon, 2 Sweet Potato, and one california. I thought I was dying but I was happy so it was okay."}
{"text":"A definite skip! If veggies alone made us sick, can't imagine their sushi.  My family and I stopped to eat lunch here on a drive from out of town (place we rather go to isn't open until 4pm) at first site it looks nice but as soon as I went to their bathroom I knew not to eat the sushi by the state of the bathroom. I ordered what I thought would be safe to give my 8month old which was an avocado roll and sweet potato roll, my Husband and I had the same meal of their filet mignon hibachi. Well I fed my son the avocado and sweet potato (not the outer fried part) I ate some of the same and both my son & I got violently ill.   I should of went with my gut feeling on how this place looked behind the scenes and not have eat there."}
{"text":"I was so surprised when I walked in this place. It was so beautiful right from the front door. I was very happy with the service and the sushi was awesome. And I loved the $19.99 all you can eat. I'm so glad that my brother in law told me about this place. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Way over priced isn't that good, small food portions. I'd rather go to a Japanese steak house they cook at table for same price, won't bother going back again"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Hands down best sushi and hibachi I've had in the state. Service is great as well as prices! We also had my dad's surprise 60th birthday party here and they were very accommodating, can't say enough good things! Get the scallops, filet, and any of the sushi--you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Preferred lunch vs dinner here...much better value. The food is good but nothing spectacular.  I will say the food was much better at lunch...maybe quality has slipped as our lunch visit was awhile ago? Service leaves a lot to wanted. Tonight the staff seemed confused and overwhelmed.  The kept bringing us wrong orders and looked annoyed when we said it wasn't ours.  This is an AYCE place where you submit what you want on a form. They will charge you for wasted food, which is totally fair. There is an up charge for certain items also.  Th decor here is odd...remnants of Ponderosa remain. Overall this is perfect for some college students that want all the sushi they can handle but not what I would consider a great date night for the younger married couple venue...just my opinion as that younger married couple that came for date night."}
{"text":"We have been to Toko many times for sushi and absolutely love it. Usually all you can eat sushi restaurants serve low grade fish, not Toko. The only reason I agreed to trying it was because of the rating on Yelp. I worked for a Japanese company for twelve years and learned early on the difference between old / low quality fish. Toko was such a wonderful surprise. The fish has always been fresh, well prepared and extremely tasty. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Northeast Ohio, if I could I would eat there daily. The staff are always courteous, prompt and friendly. The sushi chefs are the knowledgeable, experienced and remember special orders. I was amazed to find great food, experienced chefs, friendly wait staff, and awesome prices. Unfortunately most restaurants do not have all those qualities.  Applause to Toko Japanese Steakhouse and the staff!!!"}
{"text":"There's a good reason this is my go to Hibachi place. The service is amazing, the food is always good and amazingly priced, and I've finished off two of their loyalty program cards.   The filet is super tender and the rice is perfectly seasoned and cooked. My friends adore the all you can eat sushi and the pad thai is really good. This is the best place to eat in Streetsboro."}
{"text":"Love it here, just too big of a restaurant.  But other than that! It's my fav hole in wall. Sushi is always fresh and beautiful. They have an all you can eat menu available for $19.99 you do have to pay for what you do not eat so start off small and work your way up."}
{"text":"So I'm not really sure what's up with the duplicate businesses on Yelp, so I'm going to add my review that is in another entry here:  I really don't want to do this.  I don't want to sit down for sushi and have to wait an hour, which is exactly what will happen when I tell everyone how freaking ahhhmazing this place is!!    We have been hunting for sushi rolls as fantastic as Asakusa in our old town since we moved here - and we have finally found what I believe is the most comparable sushi yet!!  I ordered the Firecracker and Fire Dragon rolls and they were BEAUTIFULLY presented, well sauced, and deeeeeeelicious!  My husband ordered swordfish hibachi, which you can watch be prepared at the one hibachi grill in the back, and it was very good.  The sauces were excellent.  The ginger salad dressing was up there, not the best, but very good.  The clear soup was good except I got a funky taste when I got to the fried onions.  I'm not entirely sure if it was a weird stale kind of taste or just an onion taste so the jury is still out on that one.  (**update - this tasted fine on our second visit)  Even the after dinner candy here was so delicious - some kind of fruit that you can't get here.    Oh and the remodel is gorgeous - I have always been scared of this location but they have turned it into a very chic place - color changing LED's, hundreds of beautiful pendant lights, wood tile walls, a gorgeous bamboo garden when you walk in, big granite bars, dark wood tables with brand new leather booths...  You would think you were somewhere other than Streetsboro.  And our service was superb.  We will DEFINITELY be back.  We were also given a loyalty card, I believe it is ten visits $20 or more and you get $30 worth of noms free... I think we will be using it.    Fantastic!  Don't go here!  LOL"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to get sushi. It may look a little rough on the outside but I'm telling you don't judge a book by its cover. The service is great and all of the servers are super sweet. The inside is very clean and I recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"I came here for the weekday buffet with intention of eating lots of sushi not rice! In the end, we ordered only two plates of sushi. This place was empty when we came during Friday lunch rush. The server was very rude and was giving attitude. The buffet didn't end well, most of rolls are packed with lots of rice! I was a bit disappointed when I didn't get s chance to taste different ones. I guess well what do you expect for a $15 \"sushi\" buffet or may I call it \"sushi rice\" buffet. Try not to get the sushi, just get hibachi, appetizers, and special rolls only. I would give it a 5 if this place was an actual sushi buffet not made to order sushi buffet!"}
{"text":"I checked help for a sushi recommendation,  because I was in from out of state. I was pleasantly surprised. I had the AYCE sand was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall impressed by this place I was a little surprised to find great sushi in this area. We had the clear soup which was pretty good along with various pieces of sushi and rolls which were excellent. The restaurant seemed less busy than I expected for a Friday night and the service was still a little slow due to the sushi bar being slammed. Id rate it much higher had we not waited as long as we did. Overall  friendly staff and great sushi. Hopefully this place catches on enough to stay open it's nice to have a good cheap option for sushi in the area. Oh, and no alcohol right now but they said they will have a license at some point(the water was delicious)"}
{"text":"It was good, but we didn't get sushi, and I am thinking that is what they specialize in.  The shrimp in both dishes was overcooked.  So was the other halfs chicken.  With that being said, I'll go back and try some sushi.  I wouldn't go out of my way for this place, as it's not super convenient."}
{"text":"Their sushi is delicious, and most of the waitresses that work there are very kind and attentive. The food here is so good! The negimaki is amazing. The sushi is great! Everything is delicious.  One thing to look out for is this one girl that works there as a waitress. I don't know her name, but I guess you could describe her as the most conventionally \"pretty\" young Asian woman there. She is one of the worst servers I've had at a restaurant, ever.  My friend and I used to visit this location once a week for their all-you-can-eat sushi lunch special. This girl had been our server about 3 or 4 times before we started requesting a specific server each time we came. The only time this girl was actually attentive to our table was when we came in as a party of 12. She must have had those dollar signs in her eyes, I'm guessing. This was our first time having her as our server. The bill for our table that time came to about $300. The guy at our table who paid for everyone's meal thought that $25 was a sufficient tip for all of the work she had done. I felt really bad about that tip, so my friend and I slipped her an extra $20. In hindsight, I feel like that's where we \"fudged up\". I didn't realize it at the time, but now I see that we were only perpetuating her idea that big groups were more important ($$$) than the tables of two or three.  The other 2 or 3 times that she was our server for our table of two or four, she would walk straight past us with a pitcher of water when we had our empty water glasses by the edge of the table so she could see them. She'd walk past to go fill up the glasses of the party of 8 directly next to us. She would then walk back, not look at our table, and ignore our cups again. On each dining occasion with her, we had to walk across the entire seating area where she was just standing around, leisurely chatting with the guys who make sushi, to ask for refills on our water and soda. She let our plates pile up on our table, meanwhile, being completely attentive to her table of 8+. I have to point out to you readers that she has had only had 2 or 3 tables MAX. when we ate there, including our table. So it isn't like she's overwhelmed with too many tables and forgets things. No. She's just really bad at her job. We had this same problem every single time she was our server (with the exception of when we were in our party of 12).  We have recommended our family and friends to try out this place, and the general consensus is that Ivy-eer (that's not how her name is spelled, but that's how it's pronounced) is the best server in that restaurant. We try to request her when we go. She is attentive and friendly.   So, yeah. Great prices on sushi. Friendly waitresses if you don't get \"the pretty one\". Yummy food!"}
{"text":"We usually go to Tomo in Strongsville on half price nights so we've been spoiled...but we treated ourselves for date night this evening.  The service was insanely attentive.  I think 4 or 5 different women came to fill my beverage during dinner.  The crab rangoon was fantastic and quite possibly the best I've had.  It tasted very fresh.  The sushi, however, was okay..but it didn't blow my socks off.  We ran into my fiancé's aunt and uncle while we were there and they raved about their hibachi meals (scallops and lobster, I believe).  I think we'll return at some point but for us, Tomo is worth the drive for better sushi."}
{"text":"$14.95 AYCE lunch - outside of building is very dated as others have mentioned but inside seems well taken care of. Lots of booths and friendly staff. The sushi is passable and you'll leave full but I doubt you'll be thinking that was the best I've ever had. Fair policy of charging for uneaten food. Not a place I'd rush back to."}
{"text":"Most sushi places only have one vegetarian or vegan option on the menu but Toko has a lot to offer! I love getting sushi with my friends so ever since we discovered Toko, we've made weekly trips back! Their sushi is not pricey and they even have an \"all you can eat\" option! The staff is extremely friendly, i honestly look forward to seeing them every time i come in! Definitely worth trying out and even if you're not vegan/vegetarian try the sweet potato roll, it's so good!"}
{"text":"It's in a bit of odd place.  A strip mall with a run down parking lot and not a ton of traffic.  Once you go in it the atmosphere is surprising.  Very nice, clean, modern upscale looking place.  My husband and I went for the all you can eat for $20 deal.  The food was spectacular.  The crab Rangoon was the best I have had, the sushi was good, and the hibachi food was excellent.    I paid an extra $3 and got the filet mignon and shrimp and it was worth it.  The only thing I did not like was the ordering system for the all you can eat dinner.  They give you a piece of paper with tons of options and you use a pencil to check off what you want.  What I thought was to order a single piece of sushi was for entire roll in one section and for pieces in another.   The waitress had to fix it a few times and told us we could only order one roll from the section.  I have bad anxiety so not understanding it and being corrected over and over was uncomfortable for me.    That and I would of liked to of tried a variety of pieces of sushi instead of committing to a single full roll of one type.    To sum it up, the ordering system makes me uncomfortable but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Nice light Japanese cuisine. Food was tasty and nothing was overpowering. Service was ok. If you're in the area, stop by. You won't regret it. Located in a shopping center so plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"I visited Toko for the first time after reading positive reviews on Yelp. I had been craving sashimi and I am doing a low carb diet, so my mom and I visited Toko for dinner. I got the Sashimi Deluxe which came with miso soup and salad while my mom got fillet mignon & scallop hibachi. The miso soup was very flavorful and delicious, while the salad was crisp and refreshing. The house dressing for the salad was delicious, I am happy they gave us an extra ramekin to go with the food. I was thoroughly impressed by the sashimi deluxe, it had 18 pieces of chef selected sashimi, 3 of each kind. My platter contained tuna, salmon, yellowfin, red snapper, scallop and octopus sashimi. All were delicious and fresh. My mom said the hibachi was delicious and flavorful, she especially enjoyed the scallops. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating. The menu here is huge, especially the sushi menu but not only do they have a wide selection of Japanese offerings, they also have a few pan-Asian meals. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely be returning to sample more dishes from the vast menu."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day for lunch. Though it still looks like the old Ponderosa on the outside, the inside was decorated dark and modern which made for a comfortable atmosphere. My boyfriend and I wanted to give their sushi a go so we ordered 4 different types, along with some spring rolls and egg rolls. We were definitely impressed. We aren't sushi experts by any means, but we have gone to quite a few places for our favorite kinds and Toko's was definitely comparable. We got tempura California roll, spicy yellowtail, green dragon, and rainbow. All delicious, spicy yellowtail was my fav. The pieces themselves were rather large, especially the tempura California. We had leftovers, which I'm never mad about! We will definitely be returning the next time we need a sushi fix. The hibachi also looked really well priced compared to other places we've been, though I don't believe you have the option to get it cooked in front of you. Who cares, really? If you've seen the onion train once, you know what to expect next time anyway, am I right? I plan to try that on a return trip, as well!"}
{"text":"Traveling on business and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food.  Sushi was ok.  The combo plate filet and chicken was good.  Service was good.  The hibachi table was unavailable.  They only have 1."}
{"text":"Toko sushi is the best....love the Crazy Tuna roll.  I do wish the one in Kent had alcohol....but overall it is outstanding. You never leave hungry.  I get sushi most of the time... But hear the hibachi is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Went to Toko for the first time today and ordered takeout. We got a clear soup, miso soup, spicy scallop roll, vegetable roll, rainbow roll and tiger roll. The miso soup is very nice - my first time having it, but just what I expected -- savoury and salty with scallions, tofu and seaweed. I was mad about my clear soup, though... It was brown in color, which confused me, and I figured out why when my boyfriend ate one of the little white bits floating in it.. The clear soup is broth, 2 shaved pieces of mushroom, and tempura onion. Which means the soup basically tastes like tempura grease as a main flavor. Ew.  The sushi was good! Everything tasted fresh and clean. The sushi rice is mixed with a little bit of black sesame seeds, which I like.. The veggie roll is nice and clean tasting. Spicy scallop roll is a little mushy and not very scallopy, so we probably wouldn't get that again, but not bad. The rainbow roll was my favorite, as it's got varied flavors throughout but never gets too complicated. And the tiger roll was nice, but perhaps a little too sushi-esque for my n00b sushi-eater self.   I think we'll definitely try this place again, and perhaps try the eat-in experience next time. It's a sweet little surprise to find this place hidden in Kent, though. But there are definitely a few things they could work on. I'd actually gives this place a solid 3.5 rating currently."}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first. I believe they are a new business. But the food was delicious! Only 4 stars because they need to do some remodeling inside and out. I had the Hunan shrimp and scallions entre. Cooked perfectly. They also have good crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"Old, decaying, and dark interior. Very slow. Very bad food. One sushi roll literally contains cheese... I don't get what that's supposed to be. Would not go."}
{"text":"VERY good food!  The place is immaculate and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  The food is fresh & delicious.  As a vegetarian- I was very pleased with the amount of options!   We will certainly eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Toko is a gem.  Don't let the surroundings fool you, the restaurant is a hidden diamond.  The décor is relaxing and soothing and very pleasant.  I go to Hiram College and always find myself convincing friends to come to Toko with me.    The menu can be hard to read, but the waitresses are always very kind and willing to explain things to you.  I definitely recommend the Bento Box - it's very reasonably priced and comes with your choice of meat, vegetables, rice, spring rolls, California rolls, and soup or salad.    The service is really great and attentive - I've been there numerous times and never once had a bad waitress.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Went again..man yay for all you can eat sushi ..their habachi is the best....so yummy and they actually have yum yum sauce....best place for all you can eat because they include other items even though they charge you extra. But still a great place to eat and drink and enjoy with family and friends. Everyone is friendly attentive and they try and get you in as fast as they can even when busy. Loved this place right when it opened and love how they have stayed open and more people have found this great spot. Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My new sushi place.. Awesome quality rolls and sashimi. Well presented and great looking fish. Reasonable prices and servers are always attentive to drinks and plates.   Highly recommend(: their sushi and Alaskan rolls are the best imo and they also have hibachi D:"}
{"text":"Got takeout, the hibachi is amazing! Great appetizers, soup is pretty good despite having too much broth. The side salad is just ok, but it's a salad so that's fine. The only reason I didn't rate them five stars was the sushi. It tasted... Off. But everything else was great!"}
{"text":"So so nothing special, rice was so sticky if would probably stick on the wall no flavor unless you put soy on it will not visit again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The fish was fresh. They also have a large selection of roles. The service was excellent. My waitress was friendly and did a wonderful job."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the sushi. I got all you can eat sushi for $20. I have eaten sushi in California for years so I was a little spoiled because the sushi here is crap compared to what I am used to. This restaurant in particular loads the roll with rice with very little fish or toppings. In addition they only have a select amount of rolls that are included with AYCE. One of the rolls I ordered was deep fried and tasted terrible to the point I could not even eat it. No flavor at all. I will never be back"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi! I did have bones in my spicy tuna once, but the service is always super friendly and their special rolls are awesome. You get your money's worth here!"}
{"text":"Yum! Enough said there.  Great atmosphere, and great food. My boyfriend and I always get the all you can eat for $19.99 - well worth it if you are smart about ordering not too much. The first few time we needed up paying extra for left over sushi but we have gotten better at the perfect amount.  Sushi and hibachi are amazing"}
{"text":"My girlfriend heard of Toko from her co-worker and we had to try it. We had the Fire Dragon Egg which is imitation crab covered with avocado slices like an egg shape with little orange eggs on top. It was rather delicious. Then we both ordered the Hibachi dinner, mine was a swordfish steak, and hers was chicken. We got fried rice, soup, and salad with a very delicious ginger dressing with it. I highly recommend this place. UNLIMITED SUSHI FOR $20!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for some sushi. I got the vegetable roll and Philadelphia roll. They came out super quick. Had great presentation, and tasted amazing. Another bonus was that they were like $5 each. Best sushi in Kent hands down. YUM."}
{"text":"A really good place to take the family.....but I do have to say, a bit pricey for the portion size. Also, the fact you cannot sit around a hibachi table really stinks. AMAZING sushi and their food is very good. Also, it has a nice modern look and feel as well as clean."}
{"text":"Toko is good, depending on what you're ordering.   Starting with the good: My boyfriend loved his All You Can Eat Sushi meal and Crab Rangoon. The portion was generous and the waitress was friendly and super helpful in helping us decode the order sheet. The plating of his food was gorgeous.   For the bad: I ordered the hibachi triple dinner (chicken, NY strip, and shrimp) and it was less than exciting. The chicken was teriyaki, the steak tasted like gristle, and the shrimp was bland. My food was not plated so nicely, and looked like a clustereff.   So really, treat Toko as a sushi restaurant and not your go-to hibachi place."}
{"text":"Paid Hibachi prices without the experience. Didn't realize this place doesn't have the actual hibachi at your table, they cook it towards the back of the restaurant. Taste-wise the food was ok; my husband got some sushi and we each got hibachi. I asked if I could add broccoli to mine and our server acted like that would be a big deal. She told me I would only be given a little bit which was very accurate. For the price, and lack of ambiance I'd say not worth it."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great, and the staff was nice. The food was good, but not as good as other Japanese steakhouses that I've been to. Prices were reasonable. This location doesn't have alcohol, but the one in Streetsboro does. I would go there again."}
{"text":"This was a genuine surprise. We were visiting friends up by Kent, and they insisted we check this place out.  Toko is in a strip mall, and from the outside doesn't really look like much at all.  When you go inside, though, there's a big surprise. The inside is a very nice, modern space, with a good view of the sushi bar and the hibachi grill.  You can order off the menu, but what you really want to go for is the $19.99 all you can eat menu.  You pick from a selection of sushi rolls, sashimi, appetizers, and hibachi entrees. As a warning, anything that isn't eaten could be charged to you above the $19.99 fee, but if you've made a good faith effort to eat the food they'll let it go.   The sushi is beautiful, and I was really impressed by the quality of the fish. I was also surprised by the palate cleansing properties of some of the vegetable rolls, particularly the peanut and avocado roll. I was also really impressed by how quickly everything came out - we maybe waited 2-3 minutes for our miso soup opener, and perhaps five minutes after that the sushi began to arrive.  In the end, I probably had $60 of food for my $19.99 check, and left with a big smile on my face. If you're in the area, Toko is really worth the trip."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested this place to us, so we decided to try it! When you first pull-up, it seems a bit sketchy, but the inside is nice. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All of our meals from the teriyaki to the hibachi were delicious. The only reason I am giving it a 4 out of 5 is inconsistency between the two times I have gone. The food was good our first time and fantastic our second time. Also, I love Crab Rangoon, and the first time I got it, it was just cream cheese, barely any crab, which was disappointing because I have been on a hunt for good Rangoon. However, we went again last night, and it was fantastic! Perfect Crab Rangoon with lots of crab. I guess we'll find out the third time we go if it was a fluke or if the cooks are inconsistent? You should try it though! Very good overall!"}
{"text":"Tried to call several times but no-one answered. Looked like a good place to eat but still closed \"for renovations until further notice\"...  check before going here."}
{"text":"My wife picked this place out but she hated it.  Went for Sunday lunch just after noon, only two other tables with people.  Sign at the door states \"Only dinner entrees on Sunday\", I was hoping that they would have had some kind of sushi/entree sampler special.  Prices were much too high, all three of us ended up with the Hibachi Chicken which came drenched in teriyaki sauce.  Wife ate her soup but wouldn't touch her salad or chicken.  The takeout container leaked all over the car (no plastic bag).  The hostess/server was very prompt and friendly, but it just couldn't make up for the expensive/mediocre food."}
{"text":"Tried this place today. Definitely would not go out of my way to come back. Sushi fish was not cold, didn't seem fresh. The all you can eat sushi had huge balls of rice under thin cut fish. The spicy tuna has crunchies mixed in to fill you up faster. Only plus was the miso soup."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and thought this place would be great, however my sweet potato roll was squishy and cold when I got it, and when I asked for regular soy sauce the server brought me a dish of it, rather than the bottle. No big deal, I just thought it was a bit weird.  Also, they close at 10:30, not 11. Not the best spot in the area, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!  The outside is not appealing but since a friend recommended we tried it.  OMG amazing.  It's a beautiful place with great ambiance.    We've really stuck to basics so the choices seemed daunting but our server took so much time to understand what we like and like and then chose several items that she explained in great detail.  We ordered in stages so we didn't get everything at once and could fully enjoy each.  Tried 6 amazing things and loved each one.  Also the pricing was very good!  I can't say enough about this place.  Definitely will be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Loved the dynamite roll. The rest of the sushi and rolls were also very good. Glad it was all you can eat sushi. Servers were very nice and attentive.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants   Sushi."}
{"text":"Got all you can eat sushi and it was amazing. Salad, crab Rangoon, and a roll for $20! I could have added tons more if I wanted but knew I couldn't finish it. All of the food was fresh and amazing, tasted great. They do not have a liquor license so no sake for you here! Would come again."}
{"text":"I am a sushi freak. I crave it. I love it. I can eat it once a week. This place always hits the spot. The sushi here is excellent. The outside of the business is slightly off putting, but once you step inside, it's like you are in a completely different place. Although sometimes there is a language barrier, the waitresses I've had are sweet and always smiling. They always get my order right and are really good about checking back in with you. They have all you can eat sushi for $20. These include fancy rolls, salads, appetizers, etc. I love the food and the service here. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Love this place. 20$ all you can eat sushi!! Not poor quality buffet sushi either. Made to order premium rolls. I'm sure for the sushi snob not amazing but for the price cannot beat it. I am and will continue to be a regular visitor"}
{"text":"So delicious!! I ordered take it for dinner one night and the service was quick. The American lady on the phone was very helpful because I had never eaten there before! The people inside were very friendly and helpful! I would definitely recommend this place for a cheap easy dinner night!"}
{"text":"Toko is my go-to sushi place for eating in or taking out. There is nothing particularly good or bad about this place... it is your typical Japanese restaurant.   The sushi is good and it's the same price as sushi is pretty much anywhere ($5-6 for normal rolls and $11-13 for special rolls). They also serve teriyaki and hibachi style plates, but not hibachi like the kind where they cook in front of you.  They don't have a liquor license, so there's no alcohol there.   They do an all you can eat for $20 deal for dinner, but you have to pay for anything you don't eat.   They have a similar special for lunch (I think it's around $13) except on Sundays."}
{"text":"Average at best. Service was quick and steady. I read most of the reviews on line however I can not agree with them. The chicken tasted like they took frozen chicken out and grilled. So it was on the tough side. The salad dressing was a bit on the sweet side and was missing the tang of ginger. It was quick and descent meal.  Many other hibachi Restraunt I enjoy more."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Value, and Service.  Met my brother for lunch for his Birthday (his idea my treat) so I read all the reviews to find out a little about the place.  I couldn't be happier.  The waitresses were all very pleasant, attentive and not pushy at all.  I had 3 refills on my tea and never had to ask or flag her down. We had the all you can eat lunch for $14 and I left stuffed.  We started with the Avocado salad  It was great. The avocado was very fresh and the dressing was perfect. Then had the chicken hibachi and the chicken/steak hibachi both come with rice and two sauces.  Both were very good. Then my brother got the Alaska Roll and I got the Green Dragon roll. Both looked amazing. They were very fresh and tasted great.  I can't wait to bring my wife back here on date night.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The all you can eat food I ordered a little bit of everything it was amazing and by later he was totally awesome I definitely will be going back the surprise that I had when I paid the bill it was so cheap I definitely am going back it's hard to say which was my favorite because I ordered a lot the ambience very comfortable very definitely highly recommend this place if I could give it more stars I would. I lived all over the world and so far this is definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants I've ever had"}
{"text":"Beware of the fines for dining there! My wife and her family and I tried their unlimited sushi evening. While the food is ok our service was really slow and arrogant.  What really infuriates one the most is they fine you ( charge extra ) if you do not finish the little left over rice on your plate!! Only dine here if you like to pay fines!!  We will not be returning to this place!"}
{"text":"Looks a little sketchy but don't judge it by the appearance. Great service, pretty good sushi--fresh, but don't get a roll with lobster, as it is super chewy. The raw fish is great though?--get the shrimp tempura roll! No alcohol though, so don't plan on drinks."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Be warned. On the menu and it says that there are twin lobster tails with no further description. The two lobster tails come pre-cut and in a sauce. Not what I was expecting"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi is the best deal! We came on a Monday night. Not busy at all. Great service. Excellent sushi and hibachi grill. I did not care for the saketini. Otherwise great food!!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, & clean environment. Don't let the outside deter you, it is easily my favorite place to eat in Kent."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant I've been to in this area!  The strip mall Toko is located in doesn't look all that great.  But, the inside of the restaurant is a huge surprise...it is very modern and new.  I decided not to order off the menu, but instead did the $19.99 special.  You get 1 order of any hibachi dinner, unlimited appetizers, unlimited sushi, sashimi.  I only ordered 1 hibachi dinner and shrimp tempura roll.  Remember that you can order as much as you want, but you don't have to order it all at the same time.  The catch is whatever you don't finish, you have to pay an extra fee for.  The food was delicious!  Everything was fresh and the sushi was fantastic!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sushi rice had to be at-least a day old. They go heavy on the cheap fish.  Cheap like tilapia cheap. Save yourself the money and go to Sushi katsu in the valley.   Worst experience i have had in a long time.  Hell buffet sushi is better !!!"}
{"text":"I noticed Toko opened in the former Ponderosa building last week and was so glad to get a chance to try it last night. It was a wonderful experience! My five star review should help connote how  SUPER excited I am to have an additional sushi option in Kent.  (Not to mention the other yummy-sounding fare I have yet to try like their hibachi and noodles!!)  The building still looks a bit rough on the outside (and very much a Ponderosa) but inside is absolutely lovely with partitioned booth and table seating and an open kitchen/hibachi griddle plus the sushi bar and what appears to be a spot for a liquor bar (perhaps coming soon?)    I can't find a menu online but I believe the offerings arre somewhat similar to the Streetsboro location.  We got a Poseidon Roll, Toko Roll, and a  Salmon Volcano Roll and they were all wonderful although if I had to choose, I'd say the Toko was the standout.  Lovely presentation and good service.   When we asked the waitress about sake, she said they don't currently have a liquor license but implied that they were hoping to obtain one soon. I should also note that hibachi isn't tableside but rather in an open kitchen area.  If you're seated towards the back of the restaurant you can watch the chef (and it smells delicious) but it doesn't seem to be a \"performance\" type hibachi atmosphere like Wasabi or Hibachi Japan. (Although, if you're like me you might not mind skipping the sitting with total strangers while some person throws food at your face experience!  Fun some times, other times not what I want with a meal!)  I really look forward to returning to try the hibachi, noodles and other offerings!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent fast service. Great prices. Decent atmosphere. Both their hibachi and their sushi/sashimi/nigiri/maki are top notch for the region.  Our favorite place to eat nearby. Have been there at least 20 times since they first opened and filled up a couple repeat customer discount cards. We sometimes get take out of big sushi platters when we have gatherings at home.   My favorite things to get are Sushi & Sashimi platters, Volcano Roll, Filet Mignon & Scallops Hibachi. They have some great specialty rolls as well. Their Tuna & Salmon Sashimi is possibly my favorite.   The \"all you can eat\" menu they introduced recently is a great deal and a great way to get a little bit of everything. Easy to get yourself overstuffed though since it's all so good and they charge you extra if you don't eat what you ordered from the \"all you can eat\" menu. Which by the way I think is a great policy to prevent people from being wasteful and ordering responsibly.   I think it's location is pretty great, being tucked away in a little run down strip mall next to the post office is cool in my book. Putting existing space to good use rather than building another structure we don't need cluttering the area. Good call.  If I had to come up with some kind of criticism it would only be their choice of music being mostly modern American pop musak garbage that makes my skin crawl. Would much rather hear some traditional Japanese music. But I just do my best to block out the trashy lowest common denominator music they play. Thus the 4 stars. If they changed their music to something more relevant then I would certainly give it 5 and likely be there even more often."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get food in Kent!!! They have so much to offer on their menu. Wish it was a little cheaper but still our favorite. They also take FlashCash - such a plus!"}
{"text":"If you order the 'all you can eat' option, you get a piece of paper to fill out and check off what you want.  Well, I went there for dinner with a buddy of mine who goes about 300lbs, large fella, and he checked off about half the page.  The little Asian woman who was waiting on us explained that he would have to pay extra for anything he DIDN'T eat.  He chuckled at her patronizingly.  We got a good laugh out of that.  I love this place.  I could eat here every day.  The 'all you can eat' price is very reasonable, and again, the food is consistent and fantastic.  You would never expect it to be this good from looking at the outside of the restaurant, but don't let that fool you.  I like to sit at the sushi bar and watch TV when I'm there for lunch, and the booths are great for dinner."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat!!!! Can't wait for renovations to be done and they reopen!!! Best value! Best food! Best service!"}
{"text":"Toko in Kent is such an amazing restaurant! Seriously, do not let the outside aesthetics fool you! This is the freshest best tasting Chinese food I've ever had. The prices are good, the service is friendly and fast, and the food is quality. Generally my boyfriend and I are only there for a half hour or so, because their service is so quick! Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"Hibachi chef was very interactive and made amazing food. Our waitress was very nice. The man that was our hostess was not very pleasant. As long as they don't let him leave his podium I think they'll be alright. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"It's the best Japanese Food I have ever had. It's sooo good! You need to try this place.. You will love it!"}
{"text":"This was a very nice restaurant. Food was very good! A great value. All you can eat sushi was a great value. You do have to pay for what you don't eat but we tried a little of every thing and didn't have to pay any extra. Nothing was pre made so it is not fast. Pad Thai chicken had just enough spice. Habtchi was excellent but not made table side. You can go up and watch it being made. Great serving sizes. We did not leave hungry. Will come again. Nothing over 30.00 and they do have a bar. But not sure what those prices were. We did not order from the bar."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have made this a regular place we go at least once every 2 weeks. The chicken and steak are always delicious. The dressing they use for salads is good and so is the clear soup they serve. The pear candy they give after are really good too!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have made this a regular place we go at least once every 2 weeks. The chicken and steak combination is always delicious. They make the steak very juicy and tender. The dressing they use for salads is good and so is the clear soup they serve. The pear candy they give after are really good too!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in portage county and the service is good!! The All you can Eat deal is great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner while visiting, don't let the outside fool you. The portions of sushi are above average, the standard rolls are a little small, specialty rolls are almost double the size of the regular. Great food over all and will return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The staff was absolutley horrible. The owner was really nice and sweet. But the hostess Taylor was so rude. I used to go there all the time but for some reason she was only rude to me and my partner. She was nice to everybody else but acted like we bothered her. Then when I tried to speak to the manager he didn't really know English so of course the girls took advantage of that. They talked horribly about me to one another in front of me. The rolls were not wrapped very well either. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Non-fast food dining in Streetsboro is sometimes hard to find. I just moved to the area a couple of months ago and have routinely ventured out of town when looking for a place to take friends to eat. Decided to give Toko a try because I got an advertisement in the mail and who doesn't love a good meal that's discounted?   Verdict? Toko is by far a diamond in the rough nestled tucked away in a questionable plaza. It took 2 nights for the boyfriend and I to stop in for a meal. Night #1 we drove past and questioned the location and ended up eating somewhere else. To give you an idea the plaza Toko is in features the post office (which is right next door), a flea market, and a Save a Lot. I'm extremely glad we took a chance on night #2.   Ambiance of Toko was amazing. Inside the restaurant is so put together that you forget that you're eating in Streetsboro and not a restaurant in Cleveland. There were 2 bars in the restaurant, one that was the more traditional sushi bar and one that featured drinks. The open floor plan makes the restaurant seem much bigger than it is, but if private dining is more your thing they have a private room that I didn't even notice until we were getting ready to leave. The staff was very friendly as well, despite the service being a little too slow for my liking, and they played a Happy Birthday song over the entire restaurant to celebrate a birthday boy while we were there.   Food was great as expected. We got sushi and while it wasn't the BEST sushi I've ever had it was pretty good for Streetsboro. The names were entertaining as well, like the Spongebob roll and the Krusty Krab roll. :)"}
{"text":"Sorry, we have had better. We decided we would visit here with our son and family visiting from Florida.  Sorry, it just didn't impress any of us.  The food was just OK.  I'm guessing a lot of reviews are because some people have never eaten at a Japanese steakhouse.  They don't prepare in front of your table as others do, yet still charge high prices for very little food.  Mind you, we don't like loaded plates that you can eat off of for 3 days, but at least charge accordingly.  The rolls were fairly good, crab rangoon OK,  but all of us thought  the hibachi overpriced."}
{"text":"Driving into this shopping center, you would have no idea that a restaurant this nice was here! Walking inside the restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated.  They are known for their all you can eat option which is a little different than your typical buffet. Before your meal you are given a sheet and you can mark all of the items you want to eat.  They are then made fresh and brought out in courses.  If you want more to eat later you can always order more.  Everything I have tried here is delicious and the staff is very attentive!   If you want to save a little money, go during lunch for a lower price.  They do dinner all day on Sundays though, so no discount...bummer haha"}
{"text":"A really good Sushi place in Streetsboro? Who'da thunk it? Well it's true. Fresh sushi, an extensive saki list, a beautiful decor and excellent service. The Sushi is artistically presented AND very fresh! If you read the other review, you may have noted the reviewer asked you not to come here because they don't want to have a wait for this culinary treat. I have been here six times, and I can tell you waiting is not going to be an issue. In fact I really hope this place starts to take off! I imagine keeping a place like this going in Streetsboro is a huge challenge in itself, but when the results are this good, there is no reason to travel to Hudson, Akron or Cleveland to get your Sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place has some really good sushi. Tastes very fresh and clean. Don't have many complaints other than the amount of rice they add for their Nigiri (they put the fish on a big ball of rice), and the volcano roll had cream cheese in it (very unusual. Have never had cream cheese in a volcano roll and don't plan on having it any time soon). Over all very good food and service. Highly recommend the all you can eat sushi. Definitely worth the $20."}
{"text":"Did take out tonight! It's pretty good! The ponderosa outside is a little weird! But, my 4 out of 5 stars is simply some of the rolls were too dense and didn't taste better than others I've had elsewhere! But, the staff was friendly and full of smiles! I will definitely go again! It's nice to have something so close to home to fill that cravings So I don't have to drive out to Fairlawn! :) I'll have to try some of their other items, but for now it's good and fresh tasting!:)"}
{"text":"I visited this Toko location for the unlimited sushi lunch special, and I was not disappointed. I had heard about the lunch special from a friend, however, I was hesitant to visit the location due to the outdated facade of the building.   Upon entering the building I was pleasantly surprised that the interior was clean and updated. The menu was a little bit confusing because for the lunch special you must fill out a sheet with your order on it, however, my sushi was delicious and I feel like I got what I paid for, I will definitely return to this location again."}
{"text":"Avoid this place! Overpriced and tricky restrictions on \"all u can eat\". Be careful about the hidden fees! Even an Eskimo can make better sushi than this \"Japanese\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sushi is very good! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but deff worth a visit! The all you can eat is also good, if you're hungry! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now since first reading other yelp reviews. The interior is basically an old Ponderosa, but it is clean & comfortable. I honestly didn't even look at the menu either time because I was there for the AYCE sushi. The calamari rings are flavorful. You get 5 rings per order and they are small. That's ok though because you are there for that sushi. The spring rolls are about the size of my thumb and again very tasty. I love the seaweed salad and my husband really likes the crab salad. The gyoza is average. Nothing special but again, the best is yet to come. The sushi came to us and was very fresh. The fish is a decent size. Everything we tried was excellent. We took one of our friends there and he got a little carried away with his sushi order. Luckily, our server took pity on him realizing his eyes were much bigger than his stomach. Usually you will have to pay for the leftovers. I scolded him all the way home, so it won't happen again. The hibachi smelled amazing but I was overfilled with sushi. I'm sure we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that we tried because it had such good reviews on Yelp but then, after we ate there, wondered if the other reviewers just didn't have much access to good sushi/hibachi places and thus had nothing to compare against.  It is located in a run down strip mall, is a little cheesy in decor and rather dark and cavernous inside, the sushi was American average (sushi in the U.S. often seems kind of disappointing and this sushi was that), the edamame was bland (the best edamame I've ever had tasted like it was boiled in lightly spiced broth with ham hocks for flavor then dusted with good salt... Toko's tasted like it was simply boiled in water).  Wait staff was good, to be fair... no complaints there. It's just that the food really didn't live up to what the reviews indicate."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the all you can eat sushi menu.  So my review is only based off of that.   Restaurant was clean and decent inside.   The nigiri came with a handful of rice under each piece, (no exaggeration) which was absolutely absurd. I had requested to cut the amount of rice in half on my next order, which still came back all rice. I can only imagine they do this so that you fill up on average quality rice and don't eat more of the fish.  The quality of nigiri was \"ok\".   They seem to spend more time describing the additional fees for uneaten fish and rice instead of preparing the dishes with proper proportions and quality items.   The sashimi quality was poor. Short cuts that were too thick, and it was apparent each was cut with a \"sawing back and forth\" technique.   Rainbow roll quality was poor. Heavy on the rice with no actual fish. It was filled with imitation crab stick instead of tuna, and 4 out of 6 pieces were topped with avocado instead of actual fish.   I have been to numerous Japanese style restaurants and rating the quality of the fish and rice, and although this is not the worst place I've been, it is in the bottom quarter.   On a second order of nigiri and 1 roll, the wait time was approx 20 mins on a fairly dead night.   I do not recommend any sushi at this establishment, however the other Americanized Asian dishes that most people ordered looked ok. After all, it's hard to screw up teriyaki chicken and fried rice."}
{"text":"We love Asian food as I'm 1/2 Asian. We've been wanting to try this place after passing it, but was hesitant as the outside isn't spectacular. We decided to try it after seeing positive reviews here. We were impressed! It's not cheap, but the items were not just excellent in taste, but presentation and appearance too. The atmosphere and decor inside was beautiful, and the staff was extremely fiendly and attentive with myself, my wife, and involved our younger children too.   The kids liked being able to see some of the food being prepared at the hibachi table. I would definitely recommend trying Toko if you want a nicer dining experience and correct Japanese food."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!!!!!!! Good service! Great atmosphere! Too bad it's in a deserted plaza.. you would never think something this cute would be in there."}
{"text":"My favorite . Do the dinner buffet it has more choices. They have higher prices then but it's still bang for your buck! My favorite is the hibachi portion . Try the shrimp with yum yum sauce. I've had better sushi but can't complain this place is a hidden treasure"}
{"text":"All you can eat for $20 but you pay for food you waste.   Nice place..nice decor.. a nice selection of rolls and hibachi. Not the place to go for a first time to try sushi and rolls because youll pay for what you dont eat.   If you're used to it.. stop in and sample them all"}
{"text":"Love this place!  + Delicious rolls and a green salad, a great lemon cake and an amazingly tasty Salmon Teriyaki. - Trashy pop-music and very poor choice of soft drinks."}
{"text":"I am disappointed that my review was filtered. I'm writing again about my family's experience at this Steak Houes.  Toko is owned by Chinese, and the chef is apparently Chinese (which was confirmed by our waitress).The reason why I said in my original review that \"If you are looking for authentic Japanese food, this is not the place for you.\" Let me explain.   In authentic Japanese bendo, we don't see spring rolls -- which were included in my bendo dish. In Japanese udon noodle soup, we don't see cabbage but seaweed -- but cabbage was put in our noodle soup.   The waitress asked us if we are Korean as soon as we sat down. We have Asian background, but you cannot assume that we are foreigners. Given my family's Asian background, we have Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Tai food very often. It is easy to judge how authentic the food is for us.  I hope this more detailed review will not be filtered, again."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Best sushi for miles around! All you can eat! Great service! Can't complain when your happy!"}
{"text":"We did the all you can eat for 20 bucks I think it was. It was good because you could order a bit at a time. They charge you for anything you order and don't eat which I actually think is a good idea. The sushi was great. We had an awesome cocktail for 2 that definitely had enough liquor in. Very nice for a date night. Nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Let me put it this way.  My dinner at Toko's was the best dinner I've had this month. It was better than any other Japanese restaurants I have visited in Ohio over the last four years.  So it is $19.99 all you can eat. Caveat is you can only get 4 slabs of sashimi per person.   OMG, let me tell you. Those were the best sashimi's I've had in Ohio. When I see other folks just getting california rolls to jam in their stomach pouch, I see lost opportunities. I tried octopus, red hopper, yellow tail, and striped bass. They were all out-of-this-world. I know there's no ocean nearby. But somehow, these sashimi's were absolute, lethal killers. Mellow you out, put you through nirvana. I didn't want to use soy sauce, it was that good.   Likewise, sushis were also very good. I really liked eel, egg, & yellow tail.  The boss part about this is you can order so many different appetizers! And my goodness... The scallop pancake, holy moly! It is so chewy, and full of flavor. Beer nariyaki (something like that?). Just really neat, full of flavor, but really thoughtfully packaged.  They had it all for me. Lean food, with such great flavors in sashimi and appetizer. Even the rolls (I got eel w/ avocado) was not one of those giant, tons of mayo-based sauce, in your face decoration. It was modest but, man those flavors!!!!  If my parents/ friends came to town, I'd bring them here. Personally, I liked the flavors here more than even some of the best restaurants in Cleveland, like greenhouse of tavern, lola, etc.  For the $19.99, I ended up getting two sets of orders: miso soup; clear broth soup; scallop pan cake; beef nakiyaki(?); 2 sets of sashimi (4 pc's total); 2 pc's of sushi; 2 sets of rolls.  Go here, b/c I want this restaurant to stay open and also keep its quality! Go go go!"}
{"text":"If you have visited the Streetsboro location, this is very similar except the staff in Kent were ten times friendlier & attentive vs. their other place.    The interior here is more intimate & cozy, they still use all of the old fixture from when it was originally Pondarosa  but they added a really nice bar where the buffet used to be. The food was excellent and our waitress was very poilte and accommodating.    I will choose the Kent location over the bad service @ Streetsboro any day!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'll admit I can be \"one of those customers...\" on occasion so, keep in mind that everyone who's dinned with me at Toko's loved their food & had no complaints. I on the other hand, am an a** & take a very sick pleasure in being one.   It would be unfair of me to compare their actual meals to those I've tried at other sushi/steak houses because I've visited here twice & have only ordered their sweet potato tempura & steamed white rice, pork dumplings. But for those of you who are set in your ways, I was disappointed that my sweet potato tempura has been way too raw! The potato itself was like biting into one pulled fresh from the ground. And the seaweed paper used around the roll was gummy :( Can't say I'll be making another trip back, without a good bribe.   But the place is beautiful & clean, love their color changing lights at the bar and beautiful slate floors."}
{"text":"Efficient seevice, fair pricing, awesome rolls and soup. Loved the appetizers as well. Don't let the exterior of the establishment dissuade you. It's 10x better than it looks!"}
{"text":"Very fast service, nice on the inside compared to what you think of it seeing the outside, food tasted amazing, very nice staff, very impressed!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out due to a few reviews that I had read. The location is pretty odd in this old plaza next to the Post office and a flea market.  However, when you walk in, the place is really nice.   I didn't have time to sit down and experience the whole All you can eat for $19.99. I did, however, order take out sushi rolls. They were really good sushi.  Just as good as any place I have been in Cleveland. Hopefully I'll make it back and be able to add to the review more fully."}
{"text":"Better than noodle bar in Kent.  Love the open space.   I agree the portions can be a little small but that's a good thing.  If your looking to stuff your face hit up McDonald's and get a burger for a buck!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum this place was great. From service to the food. Sushi was good not great. The Habachi was good steak tender and flavorful. I definitely will be back. Try it you will love it. Although hard to find."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 5 times now.  I do not have one complaint.  There is plenty of parking and the place is clean, and neat.  Yes, the decor can be viewed as slightly odd since they still have a lot of the old Ponderosa stuff around, but it is tastefully done.  The service is somewhat slow, if you're in a hurry, but I highly recommend just taking your time and enjoy the food.  It comes out hot and very tasty!  Everything is plated beautifully.  I absolutely ENJOY the all you can eat sushi.  There is a small fee for uneaten sushi if you go this route, but that's why you order a little at a time.  If you finish and think you want more, order more.  You can always order more, and they staff is happy to serve you.  I have never had to ask for a drink refill, and I LOVE that!  Unless something changes, this is the place to get sushi!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  First time with just my husband and the 2nd time with the family using their buffett/party room.  Both times, the service had been flawless.  The servers were patient and kind.  They took their time to answer questions and explain dishes.  Especially when their was over 40 people in their party room!  They got every order right!!!  I was greatly impressed!!!  Their food, whether hot or cold, was delicious!  NOT ONE COMPLAINT!!!  The bathrooms were clean and neat.  The service impeccable. Friendly from beginning to end!  The best part was, they even honored the YELP! discount I got for checking in the 2nd time!  I LOVED IT!  YES I WILL COME BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I am not from here and rely on customer reviews to find good places to eat.  This one hit the spot. I got the filet hibachi dinner. Reasonably priced and soooooo good!!! It was worth the drive.  The service the prompt very clean professional and most importantly the food rocked!!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a recommendation and I'd say it met or exceeded expectations. Sushi was fresh and everything was great. I loved being able to try one piece of sushi each of something new and not being a big deal if I don't like it. Just be careful not to over order. They will charge you for \"waste\" which is easy to have considering how large the rolls and sushi are. One special roll is easily dinner for one on its own with an app. Service was great and the ambiance inside is a delight surprise compared to uninviting outside look.  Overall I'd recommend checking them out. We had a great time and definitely didn't leave hungry. I didn't get a chance to try the hibachi yet but will probably give it a try next time."}
{"text":"We come here once a week, and my goodness this is some of the best sushi I've had, and I lived in California the last 3 years.  I love the $19.99 all you can eat, what a deal.  I bring all my visitors here and they're always unsure from the outside, then they get inside, see the Benihana like atmosphere, see the menu, taste the food, and love it just like me!"}
{"text":"Toko reopened this week and we ate there last night.  The renovations included moving (and enlarging) the bar to the front of the restaurant, and installing two sit-around-it-and-watch hibachi stations along the right side.  The place was crowded as everyone is glad to have it open again. The menu has changed-- no longer all-you-can-eat for $20, it is now a regular menu but most of the special rolls are discounted by 40% Monday through Thursday.  Still a bargain place to eat sushi. The quality of the food is still good and, because they are busy, you still have to wait a while to get your order-- but worth it. Toko will remain one of our favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! To be honest I was very impressed! Don't let the appearance of the outside fool you. I was a little sketched out by it, but the inside of the restaurant is super nice, well decorated, and about as clean.  The service was fantastic! The servers were all very friendly and kept up on orders. They always ensured drinks were full and made it a point to check up on you without interrupting your meal. The food was excellent and for the quality you can't beat the price. The proportions were perfect. I left full and satisfied without a huge stomach ache and take out box full of rice. Also they probably had the best pot stickers I've ever had and the ingredients in everything else was top notch.  Overall I am very impressed with this restaurant. It makes a great replacement for places like ming cheng with terrible food and even worse service!"}
{"text":"Not good . I should have went to giant eagle for my lunch sushi . A co worker and myself went here and will never be back again for sushi . I won't be back at all actually"}
{"text":"Unlimited sushi for $20?  Amazing!  It's good sushi too, not the convenience store fast sushi, but fresh cut made by a chief who's spent his life perfecting it stuff.  They also have these \"scallion pancakes\" that are absolutely TO DIE FOR.  Get one, seriously, they're amazing.  The selection of drinks is great too, and the atmosphere is nice as well, though some of the servers are a little mean at times (or at least they were when I mistakenly came in thinking I could get the lunch unlimited sushi special on a saturday x.X)  Overall, great stuff.  I cannot wait for the one in kent to open."}
