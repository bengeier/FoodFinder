{"text":"It's worst tan before!!! Very bad! All the food don't taste good and not fresh!!! Won't go back anymore for sure!"}
{"text":"For the most part, I would not give buffets 4 stars.  But, I really think Tokyo Sushi deserves the stars because it's a pretty good value and quality.  Also, it's definitely a restaurant I would go back to.

What's worth it at Tokyo Sushi Buffet:

*SASHIMI!!!!  Obviously, it's not the best in the world, but it's pretty good quality.
*Rolls - Wasn't really a fan of most of the rolls, but they have pretty much all the standard rolls for you to choose from.
*Seaweed Salad
*Green Tea & Red Bean Ice cream - YUM!!!"}
{"text":"As a city dweller, I hate this buffet's location.  Then again, it feels like our own secret restaurant in a way.  I'm surprised how many classmates seem to know about it considering it's far from the local colleges.

Buffet is only $12 per person for weekday lunches, which is a fantastic deal.  Lots of interesting maki rolls and nigiri with tuna / salmon / unagi / etc.  Mmm.  Plenty of fried items and plenty of spicy mayo.  There's a decent number of customers, so the sushi is pretty fresh, based on how many chefs I see preparing it and how often some of the plates are empty.

The dessert is great too, which is a welcome change from every other asian buffet restaurant I've been to.  My friends swear by the red bean ice cream, but I forgot my lactase pills and I'm asian enough that I can't eat ice cream, so I wouldn't know.  The tiny little cookies just melt in your mouth.

Kids eat cheaply based on their height (2.5 / 3.5 / 4.5 feet tall), though I'm not sure how much most kids like sushi.  There's a cooked section too, but it looked like ordinary chinese food or something, so I didn't bother."}
{"text":"Couldn't complain about this place... With a lot of sushi variants as well as sashimi and hand rolls this place was made to please... A big plus for me were whole crabs and crab legs abundantly supplied in the buffet.... Everything was great except that the Habachi was not consistently cooked as instructed... Also the cooked food menu wasn't as plenty as I imagined... There's definitely room for improvement. Other than that customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing place, but unfortunately they closed. Drove there on 5.30.2016. It's dark and sad inside and almost looks like the place has been taken apart. Come back Tokyo!!!"}
{"text":"Best Buffet in Pittsburgh, fresh stuff and great prices, it's by Ross park mall so when I shop there I always stop in this amazing place"}
{"text":"Decided to go to the lunch buffet the other day and was told it would be $10.00 a person. We got our checks and it was $22.00 a person, they then decided to make our bill $16.00 a piece? The claimed they charged more on the weekend. The right side of the restaurant was crowded with people and there was still seats available. The waitress decided to put me and my friend in the left room with no people in it by ourselves in almost the last seat in the building. It was very cold in there and there was little children running around playing.... The food was okay and the service was slow... It was honestly the strangest experience ever. I felt like I was in a foreign country while eating! Not recommended. I'd rate this one star but the sushi I was able to eat. Very strange. . . ."}
{"text":"Was the best sushi place in town for the price! Fresh rolls in abundance made right there. Went today and they were closed...hope everything is ok and they open soon!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Pittsburgh since 2009 and go to Tokyo Buffet every now and then (basically whenever I go to Ross Park Mall). The first time there was amazing. The food was great, and they have a variety of food. However, I just visited them today again, and I must say (and I hate to say this) that they have become below really average. Even though the food menus look pretty much the same, I would say that their execution was just terrible. The dishes in Chinese food section was not even hot.  Salmon sashimi was not fresh. My girlfriend even became sick later in the night because of that. 

So, until they can improve to the point they were before, I will not go there again."}
{"text":"They have a lot of sashimi and sushi!!! although the sushi is like very American style...Still if you like sashimi, it's a good buffet place to go."}
{"text":"My first and last time here. The food was so terrible that I had to spit out. And the service is bad, too. Definitely won't come back again."}
{"text":"I've been out of Pgh for two years now and still haven't found ANY place as GREAT as this place!  I'm now in heart of Asian cuisine (So. CA) and there is nothing to compare to Tokyo Buffet out here. The food at Tokyo Sushi Buffet is 'consistently' great and the variety is hard to find elsewhere. All I can say is if you get a chance to go - \"GO\"!!"}
{"text":"Over priced, mediocre Chinese restaurant that serve their version of sushi. The hot food is very very greasy, none of which is Japanese cuisine. They are terribly less than ordinary food that one can get from the usual take-away Chinese, that is not real Chinese food but some semblance of it. Everything in their hot buffet is drowning in sweetened soy sauce base. The sushi is even worse. It is choked in rice, many of which has very tiny bit of fish. Some it has some indescribable powdered bits of salty fried fish or fish skin. Their bit of redemption is the small selection of sashimi, unagi, and saba, but available mostly only in the weekends. The rest including dessert are not worth it.  If you want to savor delicate Japanese cuisine, go to Umi."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, was a tough few months when it was being renovated and closed.  Massive sushi collection (about 30+ different types) and a whole other side full of mostly asian food. The sushi is always great for being not made to order. 

Wait staff is super nice, friendly,and attentive. Costs about $20 on the weekend with a drink.

If you like sushi or have never had it and want to try it be sure tp check this place out"}
{"text":"Very large selection of sushi, sashimi, and other Chinese food. There are more than 20 kinds of rolls. See the pictures for the varieties of rolls and maki. I like that they serve sashimi (only saw fish, no rice), shrimp tempura and green tea ice-cream. The sushi taste good but the seaweed wrappings are not crunchy. I would give a five-star rating if the seaweed is crunchy and they offer more selection of dessert."}
{"text":"For lack of a better description, this place is \"pretty okay.\" It's a bit further away for me, so I'm not sure it's worth the drive, but if you live close, it could be a reasonable place to go to stuff yourself.

It's a sushi buffet, so clearly the rolls will not be as fresh as a made-to-order place (they've been sitting there soaking up moisture for who knows how long). The sashimi was reasonably good, the rolls were your typical filler, and a sampling of the non-sushi items didn't result in anything disappointing.

The Asahi I ordered came in a can instead of a bottle, which was annoying."}
{"text":"Always good!  The best sushi buffet in Pittsburgh. sometimes the staff looks unpleasant though that's why 4 stars not 5."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday evening at 8. The restaurant was not crowded and so we encountered very few people in line filling their plates with food.

The sushi selection is by far the most impressive of any sushi buffets in Pittsburgh. Compared to Hokkaido just South of Squirrel Hill, I would choose Tokyo Sushi Buffet between the two because the price is lower and the sushi selection is larger and is of slightly higher quality. However, I would warn sushi aficionados that the sushi here does not compare to the freshness and quality you find on the East Coast.

The selection of Chinese dishes is refreshing--try the Peking duck (crispy duck skin with scallions and plum sauce in a bun), if you like jook (rice porridge), try the preserved duck egg jook. However, most of the dishes simply compare in taste and quality with other Chinese buffets in the area.

Lastly, I would not skip the ice cream. I love green tea ice cream and this place has lots of it! Also try the red bean ice cream. Both are a little on the sweet side, but I can't complain.

This dinner buffet can be had for $20.99--not bad if you are hungry and your expectations aren't too high."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of some of the most freshest sushi I've had. Don't miss this when near the steel city... If it only wasn't a 4 hrs ride, I'd be a regular for darn sure."}
{"text":"Tokyo buffet is the real deal. A wide variety of sushi, sashimi, and hot japanese, and chinese dishes, plus a teppanyaki grill. Weekday lunch is the cheapest, weekend dinner is the most expensive, but even if you're cheap by nature, try to spend the extra and go on a weekend evening if you want the best variety and freshest sushi (you DO). Weekday lunch is good and a good value, but no sashimi, and overall only about half as many dishes and types of sushi out. 
If you want to live it up Japanese style, start with a hot Sake, a plate of sashimi on a bed of seaweed salad, and a shrimp cocktail, before getting started on the sushi, and take your time!
They will make sushi to order for you, but most things you'd probably ask for are freshly made and already there for the taking, even hand rolls!. There are often treasures like roast duck and frogs legs on the hot buffet, and some wonderful soups that the less savvy patrons might miss. I always have a bowl of the clam soup which is a delicious clear broth chock full of small clams, and threads of ginger. They have ice cream and desserts, but they never interest me much. There are also lighter dessert choices like pineapple chunks, watermellon lychee nuts, and tamago sushi. 
Honestly I've taken my snooty foodie friends from NYC here and they too loved it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tons of sushi and selections! My favorite place for sushi in the whole world."}
{"text":"I had never been here before, but we wanted a buffet and a place with sushi, so friends recommended this place.  First off the sushi selection, OMG.  There must be 2 dozen+ types of sushi, all made fresh in front of you.  There is also a Mongolian grill.  They had a great selection of hot foods as well including typical Asian fare (ie. lo mein, beef and broccoli) as well as some great meats including crab legs, leg of lamb, steak, several different types of oysters.  They also have a desert section which includes fruit, little cakes, and ice cream.  All the food was fresh and good.  Our waitress was on the ball about refilling drinks and clearing our plates.  It is more than most people think about spending for a buffet ($17/dinner), but definitely worth it.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I just treated my son-in-law who is a Marine Corps veteran to a Veterans Day lunch at Tokyo Sushi Buffet and we had a terrific meal.

There is a tremendous variety of sushi, hot dishes, salads and desserts.  While the quality may not measure up to what he enjoyed while stationed on Okinawa Japan, he and I both thoroughly enjoyed the food, variety, value, care in preparation and attentive service.

$10.99 for lunch is truly remarkable."}
{"text":"If you love sushi, there is honestly no other place to go in Pittsburgh. We have been to literally every place in this city that serves sushi and you simply cannot beat the quality and value at Tokyo.  It is truely a huge selection of sushi, sashimi, and maki.  They even put some of the good stuff on the sushi bar like yellowtail and mackerel.  The rolls are creative and delicious. They have a satisfying dessert bar, a nice dim sum station, a mongolian grill area, fresh oysters and clams, and a full chinese food buffet as well.  I havent had much of the chinese food since I'm there for the sushi but from what I had it was average run of the mill chinese food.  Oh and they have the option of doing AYCE hibachi, how cool is that?

Do NOT miss this restaurant.  It will not let you down."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch.  The service is very good, server polite and quick to add water or remove plates.  The food selection is definitely better than the standard $5 - $7 lunch buffet (this one is $12), and the sushi selection is large (for lunch).  Because of the low guest volume (less than half full), some food sits out and \"dries\" out a bit - not unrefresh, just not as fresh.  Certainly had no digestive problems afterwards.  For those who are interested in more authentic Chinese fare, there are a few authentic items - like chicken feet, pig hock, and so on.  While the sushi was generally good, the \"fresh\" seafood section (crawfish, mussels) are just so so, they all taste very bland and \"watered down\".  Maybe soaking in water for too long?  Overall, for a splurge lunch, this seems to be worth it!"}
{"text":"When my friend first mentioned a sushi buffet on McKnight, I asked, \"Are you sure? Sushi? Buffet?\" Somehow the words sushi and buffet juxtaposed didn't make too much sense - until you come here. The sushi is delicious. There is plenty of variety in the nigiris, the sashimis and the rolls. I like my rolls simple and this place delivers. There is some kind of mango salmon (raw) salad kind of concoction that's a must get for a mango and/or a raw fish afficionado. Must! There is also a whole side serving Asian (I use the term loosely) foods and grill items. I have picked a piece of veggie (so that I could feel good about myself after chowing down all the carbs and protein) but I never had a real need to venture that way. The sushi keeps me that busy. There is apparently also a hibachi. The dessert section is a little sub par, but I have never been there for the dessert."}
{"text":"The food quality has not dropped in the roughly-year since I've started going there. I just wanted to highlight that unlike most buffets, the vast majority of food there seems to be homemade - the dumplings, egg rolls, baozi (when available) may not look nice and uniform, but they have that homemade taste that is rare at buffets."}
{"text":"So glad to see Tokyo open again! For the quality and price (only $11 for weekday lunch!), in my mind this is the only all-you-can eat buffet to go to in Pittsburgh, regardless of the food, but definitely for sushi. There's a ton of variety, including a decent hot bar with Chinese/American options if you don't want sushi, and a good range of desserts if you left yourself room. 

I've never gone for the Hibachi, and only once for the more expensive dinner buffet, but for lunch, Tokyo can't be beat."}
{"text":"Large sushi selection, overall good quality and taste. Buffet also included typical hot Asian dishes and a stir fry station. We'll go again."}
{"text":"The best Sashimi/Sushi buffet anywhere. Eat here every couple of weeks. They don't always have raw oysters"}
{"text":"So when I hear \"Sushi\" and \"Buffet\" in the same sentence I normally wince but this was an excellent surprise. 

I wish I would have remembered what I actually ate but I kinda went wild when I saw the layout ( I was on sushi withdrawal).I think I dominated about 10 different kinds of sushi...I am not really sure it was all a haze. I was on wasabi overload and it was delicious! 

Sushi was creative and fresh! They also feature american chinese food which I tried to stay away from but I gave in to a dumpling or two.  

My only gripe is that some things were mislabeled (I don't eat red meat or pork) so this was frustrating."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's very chill and family friendly. Also, I think it's a lot cleaner comparing to Hokkaido. Always a treat when I have a chance to stop by here for dinner. The service is average, but efficient. 

I come here for 4 things: crab legs, raw oysters, sashimi and green tea ice-cream. The crab legs used to be so good, but recently I noticed them getting really salty. Squeeze on a little lemon and the problem is solved, but made me wonder if they did that on purpose to reduce the amount of crab legs consumed. Raw oysters are fresh...add some hot sauce and I'm in food heaven. They have a large selection of sashimi and I usually get a little bit of each, but still my very favorite is the mango sashimi. Last but not least, I end with a giant bowl of green tea ice-cream. They do have a decent selection of chinese/asian food too, which I sometimes visit, but I tend to be too distracted by the seafood. Well it is a sushi/seafood buffet (hence the name), so if you come here for general tso or fried rice, then save your money and get take out. 

Also, if it's your birthday, tell them and they'll bring out the gong!"}
{"text":"I normally go for lunch during the weekdays, $10.99 which includes a great selection of fresh sushi.  The sushi selection range from simple maki and rolls to rainbow sushi.  My favorite item, other than sushi is the stir fried udon noodles.  The dinners and weekend buffet are more expensive and include items like sashimi and crab legs."}
{"text":"I really like this place so when I heard it was closed, I feel really sad. Today I notice that on Yelp its status has changed to open again. I go there immediately but it turns out to be a disappointment. Tokyo Buffet is still CLOSED as for 4/16/2016 18:00. The comment above is misleading.  Even though I really hope it can reopen soon because I really miss the great sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"I got my family to Tokyo Sushi Buffet & Hibachi for my mom's birthday. This is located next to the shopping mall with ample parking. The buffet cost 20.99 per person & additional charges for drinks. There are over 50 varieties of food. Beside Japanese food, there are Chinese Dim Sim & Chinese food. Most of the Japanese buffet only serve sushi but no sashimi, but this place has a full time chef who constantly put out the freshest sashimi. I love the white tuna especially, It was so fresh & sweet, I even gone for second serving."}
{"text":"If you have to go to a buffet, I guess this is the one to go to.  

Pros:  Choices of sushi are numerous.  Hibachi available, in addition to your standard buffet dishes.  

Cons:  Quality of the sushi is just OK, which I guess is to be expected from a place like this.  Pieces are teeny weeny and taste ranged from OK to not very good at all.  As far as buffet food goes, this was good, but still not close to the standards of other restaurants in the area.  

A huge con for me:  Unclear labeling.  It was difficult to tell what dish was what, and much of the sushi labels were hard to read.  If you are picky about what you eat or have to be (in my case I had to avoid certain types of fish), then you may have a tough time.  

Pricey, especially for dinner.  Sure, you can stuff yourself with mediocre food and leave not wanting to eat for days, but I'd rather stop at Sushi Tomo down the road and get well made, great quality sushi for the same price."}
{"text":"We arrived there around 8 PM weekday night. Not many variety of food left, which is disappointing because I was looking forward to ebi tempura maki (coz it's hard to make this maki tastes bad; it's my first thing to try at any sushi buffet venue). We asked for more salmon; the chefs immediately prepare them for us. Still, so many of the maki and nigiri are missing that I gave only a 3 star.

I have to mention that this place used to be cheaper than this. This time I paid about $20 with student discount."}
{"text":"I love sushi. When people tell me they love sushi, I tend to ignore them because I. truly. love. sushi.

Anyway, Tokyo Sushi Buffet is awesome. The best time to go is when they're super busy because you're guaranteed that everything is fresh. However, I've been there when it was near empty and I didn't have a problem with the quality of food.

Everything is always aesthetically pleasing as well as appetizing. If you're not a huge fan of sushi, fear not. On the other side of the sushi bar, there's a variety of food from fried rice to Udon noodles to crab legs. There's also a dessert bar that serves many different pastries as well as ice cream. It's pretty much a win win.

I've never had a problem at Tokyo Sushi Buffet and I don't think you will either!"}
{"text":"What a good find!   Endless Sushi, Nice Selection.   non-sushi options.  The sushi was good, much better than most sushi places and buffets.  At lunch time, the rolls were replaced regularly.   It was hard to find, being tucked up on top of the hill by Best Buy.

The only compliant is the drinks.   We tried a Tokyo Tea, Poma-tini and a glowing green drink.   All were way too sweet and \"Syrupy\".   Stick with a straight drink or beer."}
{"text":"The sushi is well prepared and there's a pretty wide variety. I was especially impressed that they had hand rolls and even sashimi; they could have cheaped out by only serving various rolls with tons of rice and little filling, like the other Chinese buffet places in the area do.

The \"hot\" buffet is nothing special, but they serve the staples. They also have a Mongolian grill, and that's a better bet if you're looking for cooked fare. But the sushi is definitely the star here.

The prices are very reasonable, actually a little cheaper than the average Pittsburgh buffet, which is impressive when you consider how much good sushi you can get for your money."}
{"text":"Easily the best Asian mega-buffet in PGH.
It was another name in the same building, years ago and this version is a huge up-grade from the prior .
The sushi is as good as you'd get at a proper sushi joint.   The miscellaneous Chinese dishes are just amazing .. Highly recommended for Asian food people and buffet aficionados.  The price is a bit higher than everywhere else, as well but oh well .
I just wish I lived closer ."}
{"text":"The 2nd star is for the service, which was lovely.  The food is a near-zero.  We visited Tokyo Sushi Buffet last night on a [birthday] whim since our planned spot (Gaucho) was packed to the max.  I was craving crab legs so out to the buffet we went!  The sushi chef was very, very nice; and though the hostess was a little gruff, the overall service was solid.  But the food? Oy. The sushi was fine, but the rice a little watery tasting. The dessert was awful and the hot items were just ok. The second batch of crab legs were fair, but really bendy (the first were the worst).  Both us felt a little sick after our dinner, so I'm sorry TSB - we won't be back :-("}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of sushi for a good price.

The sashimi is on point and plentiful.

The crab legs and craw dads were a little old and were lacking in quality. (I am assuming they just sat out a while and I missed the fresh batch.

Overall we will be back and enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"I have literally waited an hour and a half outside Tokyo Sushi Buffet waiting for it to reopen for dinner.   I was overwhelmed by the selection of sushi but I love the tempura rolls. 

Pardon me, I'm salivating while I type this review.  Easily one of the best sushi buffets in the Burgh.  

The perfect ending to an extravagant all you can eat Asian buffet is their green tea ice cream. 

p.s The salt and pepper shrimp is to die for."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant. The sushi selection takes up half the buffet!!! You really get you moneys worth."}
{"text":"Tokyo is not my first choice for sushi, but it's impossible to beat the value.  I thought the price was very reasonable and the selection is quite impressive.  

Although not a favorite place to eat, the price is right.  We had excellent service at our table of 8."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing this place at the top of the hill on McKnight for awhile and thought we would give it a try as we found ourselves at this end of highway and were too hungry to keep driving around. 

Upon walking into the place and even opening the double doors to the breezeway of the entrance there was a foul smell that hit us hard and was really, really oppressive. It was like a fishy, garbage, sewage type of smell that unfortunately stayed with us throughout the duration of our dinner. The seating area, buffet area, and lobby ALL had this stench that was really unappetizing. I'm not even entirely sure where it was coming from, but I  do know that it was gross. 

The woman behind the counter at the entrance asked us if we only had two. We told her yes, and she very hurriedly rushed us to be seated even though there were no other patrons waiting to be seated and the restaurant itself wasn't even half way full with people. 

We did not receive a menu or any choice for that matter of what we wanted to eat. There was also no prices listed ANYWHERE as to the price of the buffet or anything else that might be served at this place. The waitress did not ask us what we wanted and did not offer any menus or prices -this was irritating to me as someone who had never been in this place before - I didn't know what I was getting or even what I was paying to eat at this restaurant. 

Fiance and I, upon being led to our booth table were skeptical of what we were about to eat at this point.  The table was somewhat dirty when we sat down. We almost left after we were brought our waters due to the smell and lack of menus/pricing. Fiance went up to the buffet to have a look around - he came back to the booth and said it looked good and that we should give it a go. 

The variety is not large for what they offer, but the sushi itself was abundant and actually fairly good. It certainly wasn't the best Ive ever had - but just OK. In comparison to the sushi at the Hokkaido buffet in the Waterfront this was definitely lacking. Hokkaido is definitely 100% better (not to mention cleaner). 

Once we were done eating we went back to the front counter to pay for our meals. Fiance had walked around the restaurant and asked the woman at the front how much the buffet was - he was told it was $16.00/person. We were charged $46.00 for two buffets and ONE COKE. Apparently a coke at this place is $15.00. I was so annoyed that we paid $50.00 for a sub-par dinner in a dirty restaurant. This to me explained why there was no menu or pricing listed anywhere - I did not understand how our bill was so inexplicably high. It should have been around $35.00 (with Coke). Needless to say I feel that we had been screwed out of our bill and charged more for things we did not eat nor expect to pay for. 

We will not be back here. From now on, a trip to the Waterfront will be in order next time we want a sushi buffet. Sorry, Tokyo, I think I am done giving you my money as you charged me $15.00 for a Coke."}
{"text":"Best oriental seafood buffet in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Don't go in the late afternoon and expect fresh food. Even though we were there around 4pm, and they said they changed over for dinner, the food had been sitting out all day. Too expensive dinner prices for not-fresh food. We won't be coming back because of this experience."}
{"text":"If you're a sushi fan, you'll not go wrong at Tokyo Sushi Buffet.  I'm someone who is sensitive to certain fish, and trying to tell someone with a language barrier what kind of fish I can't have is challenging enough, but when your health depends on it, I find that the sushi buffet is the perfect solution.  The only problem with sushi buffets are, with with buffet quality as some places being hit or miss, you can't run the risk of eating a \"miss\" when it comes to raw fish.  

With that being said, I can't say I've ever had any issues with freshness at Tokyo Sushi Buffet.  They serve sashimi at dinner service, and they don't skimp on the size of the pieces either.  I have friends who come down from Youngstown Ohio just to eat their food.  It's a few bucks, but in my opinion, it's money well spent."}
{"text":"Sushi quality is okay.  When I go there, I usually do not eat the sushi.  The flying fish roe was so salty.  The octopus was stiff.  And everything else was just overly embellished it was essentially not sushi.  Something about sushi buffet freaks me out - I can't help but to equate that with cheap sushi and with cheap sushi = cheap fish =  higher levels or mercury?  The steak (london broil) is pretty flavorless. And the meat texture is too tough.  But come to think of it, it is a buffet so I cannot really be too critical.  I love their clam soup.  That is pretty much the only thing I eat from there.  I love the clam stock and the ginger.  

I also really like the tapioca in the dessert section.  My only suggestion is to leave out the fruits and the taro and perhaps put them separately on the side so people can add as they please.  I for example, do not like taro.  My sister on the other hand, hates having the melons in there because it dilutes out the coconut flavor the tapioca is supposed to have. 

Don't get the kiwi fruit.  It is obnoxiously sour and has consistently been.  As far as ice cream, they should try to be a bit more diligent about cleaning the water bin that holds the ice cream scoops and the ice cream scoopers themselves.  The water is usually murky and the handles are all sticky :-/

The biggest and major complaint I have is the management.  I am a student so I get 10% or 15% (I don't remember which) off.   I gave the server my student ID and a gift certificate I had.  She came back to inform me that she is not allowed to let me use my student discount with my gift certificate.  I spoke to the manager and she actually put up a fight about it.  It is 110% understandable if I'm using a discount on top of another discount, but no, this was clearly not the case.  And no, the manager did not budge.  So I was, and  still am, absolutely livid about the fact that she was trying to hustle me."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is an amazing value for $10. I easily ate $30 worth of sushi alone, and they have a great selection of Chinese food and yummy desserts on top of that. I love the green tea and red bean ice cream.
After going once with my SO, I brought a group of 10+ of my friends so we could fuel up before an afternoon of shopping at Ross Park Mall. The dining rooms are huge and they had no problem accommodating our large party. Everyone was very pleased with their food, and especially the value. The waitress who came around to refill our water and tea was kind, and paying the check was seamless. I'll absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"This was really gross. Three of us went and we're all feeling sick. The smells, the sights, the tastes, everything was rough. Except the jello. That was ok."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very wide selection of Japanese food at the buffet. The taste of the food was good. The price was not expensive. The server was nice and gave drink refills. The bathrooms were clean. The only thing is that I got some...digestive issues within hours of eating there. My husband did not. I would be willing to return to eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Dinner prices are about $20 but come hungry because there is plenty to eat. I have never seen such an extensive buffet. They have sushi that they are rolling while you go through, a teriyaki station, Japanese, Chinese, and everything else. The quality of the food was good and they kept the buffet clean. If you are in the mood of Asian but aren't sure what to get, check out this buffet."}
{"text":"Meh.  I was expecting better.  It isn't that it wasn't enjoyable, it is just different then what I expected.

First, the website shows that there is a choice of hibichi buffet, sushi buffet or a la carte off the menu.  That is no longer the case.  All the offer is one large buffet for $20.  This was a disappointment to one person who just wanted to order a small dish as they weren't that hungry.  

There was a large selection of sushi, but the rolls were generally the same roll with minor modifications.  It would have been nice to see a greater variety in the rolls offered.  There were two types of sashimi available.  I wish there had been more.

The hot chinese entrees had a decent selection, but nothing stood out as exceptional.

I was disappointed in the hibachi.  The meat was kept separate from the rest of the items that were grilled, so it did not retain the flavor.

I may be back if I'm really craving sushi and want large quantities of it, but it won't be a regular stop."}
{"text":"The decision to eat at a sushi buffet in the middle of BF, PA was a risky one, but it proved to be safe. They have a pretty decent selection of sushi as well as hot foods, I was actually impressed. I've had better quality buffet sushi, but it wasn't bad here. I like that they kept their sashimi fully stocked, and they have a lot of nigiri options.

Their red bean ice cream just tasted like chocolate ice cream with bits of red bean in it. Weird.

Overall a decent option for buffet. Quality isn't great, but hey I didn't get sick afterwards. 3 stars by my standards, but 4 stars for BFPA standards.

Note: The entrance to the plaza is a bit confusing. It sits on a giant hill, and there was no easy way to enter from the direction I was coming. The road to enter was almost parallel to the road I was on, and you could only go in from the opposite direction, so I had to keep driving and pull a U-turn. Well, it doesn't sound that confusing, but if you go there you know what I'm talking about. There was no entrance sign or anything to let the driver know what was up on that hill. Even Google maps was stumped. It was basically like, \"your destination is in that general direction, good luck, f that, I'm out.\""}
{"text":"If you couldn't tell from my review of the Minado Sushi buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/minado-morris-plains#hrid:fjvRELRpRsEE5GvCrDuDdg), I like my sushi. 
And my food. 

Sure, I can appreciate high-quality sushi -- the likes served up by Sushi Yasuda in NY. 
... But then my gluttonous side gets a hold of me. 

$17 for a lunch jam-packed with huge sashimi slabs, plenty of maki and hand rolls, shrimp cocktail, and ice cream. 

Granted, this place won't win any culinary awards (and the cooked foods weren't exactly palatable). 

But when you eat your weight alone in raw fish and still are standing the next day for under $20... there's something to be said about that."}
{"text":"A lot of selections, service is also great. And dinner only costs 16.99. I will recommend this to any one who eating in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi is freshly made, and they serve both sashimi and sushi. They have a nice selection of sushi, which tasted good, but doesn't quite match the quality of a good sushi restaurant. There's also a big selection of cooked foods, mostly typical chinese dishes. They also have crab legs. And they also have a habachi grill, where you choose raw ingredients, give it to the cook, and he grills it in front of you. I recommend getting a bunch of scallops at that grill."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet. A hot Asian food section, a large hibachi section, a huge sushi section and a large fruit and desert section. Each of the sections is bigger than the whole buffet at some local places. Food is good, and sushi is made regularly so it hasn't been sitting around (like you find in many buffets that throw sushi into the mix)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid sushi buffet for Pittsburgh. Took a long bike ride to get here, which definitely prepared us with a nice hearty appetite. We came here for the weekend lunch buffet, which is a little pricier but not bad (a little over $20 including tip). 

There was a nice variety of tasty sushi and sashimi, and the freshness seemed good. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the hibachi a lot, and it provides a good break from all that sushi. One complaint my boyfriend has was that the crab legs were really not fresh at all and not worth eating. Oh well. There are a couple of desserts, but I thought the only worthwhile one was the green tea ice cream. Otherwise, save your stomach space for more sushi and hibachi!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi is amazing. We used to go to this place when it was still a Chinese buffet, and they had a pretty good selection of dim sum. I was kind of bummed to learn that was gone, so I went in with pretty high expectations. I wasn't disappointed.

For $20.99 (ish?) on a Sunday night, my husband and I had an amazing meal. I love seafood, so I was basically in hog heaven. Salt and pepper shrimp, crab legs, even lobster claws and grilled lobster? Chicken feet, har gow, edamame, miso soup... and that doesn't even cover the first section of the buffet.

Turn a corner, and you enter the sashimi section. Some of the slicing was a little uneven, but the plates were constantly refreshed (it was busy when we were there -- just at opening time for dinner) so nothing was dry or questionable.

One more corner, and you've hit the maki jackpot. I pretty much couldn't believe how many kinds of rolls they had, from the basic to the highly specialized. Spider rolls, even. There wasn't a ton of nigiri, and sadly my favorite umeboshi roll was MIA, but there were so many other options I couldn't complain. Sushi chefs stand behind the buffet and constantly remake and refill the rolls, so again, no dried-out rice or chewy fish.

I ate my weight in raw salmon, smoked salmon rolls, spider rolls, lobster, spicy tuna hand rolls, tempura rolls, ebi nigiri, and everything else I thought I could reasonably fit into my stomach.

I did finish with a few desserts; the tiny almond cookies were delicious, and the Asian sponge cake was... well, what it usually is (mostly nondescript but with a nice texture). They still have the egg custard tarts from the previous incarnation, thank God. Oh, and the mochi sesame balls. There was also a coffee-and-cream jello worth trying. The red bean ice cream didn't have much flavor, to me, but the green tea ice cream was great -- grassy, a little bitter, not too sweet.

Service was good, even when it was crazy busy, and the atmosphere is pretty nice, especially for a buffet. Everything was spotless, the lights were a little dim, and the booths were comfortable.

Will I be going again? Oh yes, yes I will. If you don't care about lobster, lunch and dinner from Monday-Thursday are cheaper. It's no Chaya, but the quality is excellent given the price and variety."}
{"text":"They have a lot of authentic Chinese dishes here that you'd find in china town if Pittsburgh had one. The sushi is good, but you're not going to find the high end stuff here."}
{"text":"This place serves sushi and Chinese food. I mostly stuck to the sushi, but since it was a buffet, I decided to sample a little bit of everything. Overall, I would say this is the best lunch deal in Pittsburgh because it is only $11 for lunch during the week. The quality of the food is not the greatest, but this has got to be the greatest price for an all you can eat buffet. Most of the sushi rolls either had salmon or tuna, with variations on what they added to each roll. The taste was pretty homogeneous though. There was also some Nigiri. For chinese food they had some sweet and sour type dishes, clam soup, pot stickers, lo mein, and fried rice (maybe about 15 different dishes). They also had a selection of desserts featuring some cakes, jello, and ice creams. Service was pretty good and the decor was nice. There is also a dinner section in the back featuring teppanyaki  (where they cook the food in front of you).

{"text":"Let me start out by saying first off that I love buffets. I love sushi buffets even more. Add crab legs and other Oriental dishes? Sold. So with that in mind, let's begin. 

It was my boyfriend's birthday a few weeks ago. He originally wanted to go to Joe's Crab Shack. After some internet research, I decided it would be better for us to go to Tokyo Sushi Buffet since we both love sushi and crab legs. We were going out for dinner on a Saturday and decided to get there as soon as dinner started. And oh my, we were not disappointed one bit. 

We got there at 4 and couldn't wait to get started. I had one full plate of random types of sushi. All of the pieces I had were delicious. The boyfriend agreed. He also had a full plate of sushi and was in heaven. After that we had a lot of crab legs, which were also very good. We also had shrimp tempura. The tempura was pretty tasty for being on a buffet. I also had a few Chinese dishes which were very good. Lastly, I had a plate of fruit and some yummy green tea ice cream. A completely wonderful meal. I was so satisfied that I had problems trying to leave the restaurant. My tummy was full many, many times over. :) 

All in all, this place is wonderful and for me, the price ($21.99 for dinner on the weekend) was a great value. Believe me, I ate my share of food at this buffet. I always do. I can't recommend this place enough and i can't wait to go back there."}
{"text":"Great sashimi!  Great sushi rolls too.

Their raw oysters weren't as flavorful as Hokaido Sushi Buffet and they didn't have as a good a selection for Teppanyaki.

But they had red bean and green tea icecream. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  On one side is the raw sushi dishes, and on the other is the cooked meals.  The desserts are on one whole wall, including ice creams.  On another whole wall is cooked to order items.  The cheesy crab dish is my all time favorite.  But, I love it all.  Go home stuffed to the gills!  Oh, and don't forget to grab some of the moche sesame balls for dessert.  They are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I have been to one other sushi buffet, Todai in Las Vegas--and there is much more selection here.  Sushi and maki rolls, any kind you can imagine, and sashimi offerings of tuna, salmon, and snapper.

There is also hibachi, hot food, and an impressive selection of dessert and fruit.  

Minus one star because they were slow to refill items--there were things I wanted to try that disappeared and weren't replaced the entire time I was dining."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Monday evening with 3 dining companions for dinner.  The first thing that I always notice whenever I walk into this place is how large the buffet actually is with 4 large areas, 1 each for dessert, sushi, hot food and Mongolian BBQ.  The dining area is clean but has nothing special that comes to mind for me to comment on.

All 4 of us came here for the buffet and the star of that is definitely the sushi.  I would guess that they have over 50 different types of rolls as well as some different cuts sashimi at any given time.  All of it was
good and had a better quality than expected from a place serving such large quantities of it.  My only complaint about it is that if you are not familiar with the roll, it is sometimes hard to figure out exactly what you are getting with the signs the way that they are.  The hot food has many different types of dishes from all over Asia including some dumplings,  egg rolls, General Tso's chicken and other favorites.  It is satisfactory but I would not be coming here just for that.  The Mongolian BBQ I can not really comment on as I have unfortunately never used it even though the meats and vegetables look pretty good.  Finally the desserts are what you would find as many Chinese restaurants and are once again, nothing special.  They do have a decent selection of ice creams though with the traditional vanilla and chocolates as well as red bean and green tea and more. 

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here sometime in the future.  For the price, It is by far the easiest way to try and enjoy as many different sushi rolls  which is nice.  The service is always good as well with waitresses both cleaning your used plates and filling up your drinks promptly."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Waitress was very attentive to our large table. Sushi and BBQ chefs were quick and offered to make special rolls and sashimi to-order, no extra charge! Fun place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I thought the sushi here was mostly average although the sashimi seemed really fresh and tasty! One thing I usually like at sushi buffets is the eel and the eel here is lackluster at best. They did have a few cold items to the right of the sashimi like the chicken which was quite tasty and pretty authentic!

At first glance it seems like there are many rolls but there was not a ton of variety on rolls with a hunk of fish inside. The hot items are nothing to write home about although they did have crab legs for dinner on a weekend. They have about 20 items on the dessert bar and the fried pumpkin cake dessert they had was pretty good and the red bean sesame ball was actually still hot and fresh! I grabbed an eclair as well and it was nasty, stale, and left a really bad after taste in my mouth.  It wouldn't be my first choice when looking for sushi but it's a decent place to eat at."}
{"text":"Let me preface with: 
1. I'm really not a buffet fan. It sucks, but I can't eat that much, I hate gluttony, and food waste pisses me off. 
2. I'm writing this solely based on carry-out. I've only eaten-in here once. So proceed with caution. 
3. This really is more like 3.5 ... quality of fish being 4, selection being 3 ... yah, that's like 3.5. 

I actually had no idea they did carry out. I walked in, all nonchalant, asked the girl at the hostess stand if they did. She also seemed confused by this - it was only her second day. Then, in a moment of enlightenment, the clouds parted and that heavenly glow appeared over the signs displaying carry-out pricing (per pound, per piece sushi vs. sashimi) behind the hostess stand. Alas, fate was revealed. 

You can take as many or few containers as you want. There are prices for combining hot buffett + sushi, or just sushi + sashimi, or you can go all hot buffet per pound. I'd be remiss to try and quote you all these prices, but let's just say it is extremely reasonable. 

And, the fish is fresh. There were at least 8 different options for sashimi, 15 rolls (although these weren't as attractive as the sashimi, maybe just due to size and/or variety - but anything you could really want), seaweed salad, you know - all you need for a legit sushi dinner. 

My bill came to $14 and change. I'm not sure if she counted correctly or not, but I had a hell of a selection. It was delicious - so delicious, that I think about it at least once a week. If McKnight wasn't such a terrible hike from South Side ... I'd be there now."}
{"text":"No - just no. 

I had been wanting to try this place for quite a while, so when my boyfriend suggested we go here for dinner I said let's go. 

I'll note that it had been a very long time since the last time I dined at a buffet, so perhaps I forgot what the experience is like? I think the biggest turnoff to me was that there was so much (I mean a ton) of food out on display, but the restaurant was barely a quarter full at 7p on a Monday night. I was legitimately nervous to try some of the food, although the sushi looked and tasted fine. There was too many hot and cold items for me to remember, but I can tell you that the oysters on the half shell were a yellowish color. Honest to god, I've never seen anything like it. I chalked this dinner up as one me and my partner could laugh about at some point in the future. Service was fine, but I'm truly grossed out over the amount of food on display for such a small crowd and couldn't help but think how much would reappear the next day for lunch service."}
{"text":"Sushi? Good. Buffet? Good. Sushi + Buffet= Awesome.

Seriously? Do the people at Tokyo Sushi Buffet know what they're doing? Consistently good all-you-can-eat sushi, big strips of raw salmon and tune, a wide variety of hot and cold Asian cuisine, and what's that on the other side of the restaurant- a hibachi table room? For how much? 

I've had sushi all over town- Nachama, Benihana, Andy's at Wholey's, etc, and I usually pay a lot for it. What I love about Tokyo Sushi Buffet is that while not all the sushi is OMG-best-ever amazing, it does give you a chance to try a lot of different sushi that you might be intimidated to try elsewhere because of the price. Everything is always fresh, and the sushi chefs are really good at keeping up with changing and replacing items. Head over to the other side of the buffet and you'll find a variety of hot Asian and American dishes like Sesame Chicken, spare ribs, a variety of rices, and lots more. They also have several soups, but I usually stay away from those since I can never tell what's in them and frankly I don't want to eat body parts I can't identify (lol). 

If you like sushi, or have never tried it before, make sure you stop here- it's a great introduction to sushi that won't make you wonder why you spent $30 on a raw quill egg on a cucumber roll."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi buffet in Pittsburgh because of the great variety of food. Quality is good for a buffet. Lots of seating too!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I were leaving Best Buy one Saturday about lunch time when what do my eyes see?  A Tokyo BUFFET sign in the same parking lot!  

Hubs and I have tried a few buffet places around Pittsburgh since we'd moved here about 3 years ago so we decided to try this one too.  

So glad we did!  On the day we arrived for lunch, there seemed like a Japanese women's convention was going on with about 40 Japanese women going thru the buffet line.  I felt at home as it seemed like my mother and all of her friends were gathering to eat lunch.  As a matter of fact, one of the ladies bumped in to me and said in Japanese, \"Shitsurei shimasu\" (excuse me) and then in English \"oh, I'm sorry\" to which I replied, \"iie, ii desuyo\" (no, it's allright), which was met with laughter between the 3 ladies standing with her.  They laughed about it and invited me to the private dining room where there were 50 or so Japanese women having lunch. They informed me that they meet twice a year for fellowship and they just happened to make reservations at Tokyo Sushi Buffet.  

It's always a good sign to see Asian's eating in an Asian restaurant because the food is more authentic and tastes great.  The restaurant has 3 dedicated sushi makers who make anything from rolls to hand-rolls to sashimi.  They do take special orders although some of the sushi selections are not on the sashimi ice block. The sushi portion of the buffet line is the largest we've seen in Pittsburgh.  YAY!    
There are other selections on the buffet line:  6 different types of soup, a chef cooking Mongolian grill-styled stir fry, dessert bar and Chinese and American selections.  Hubs and I liked that their buffet line had dedicated people working each section instead of one guy making sushi AND cooking on the grill.  This makes for great customer service.    

What would make it a 10:  
- dining room needs a makeover
- more lighting
- another waiter or waitress or two -- we've been twice in the last few months and the waitress seems to be rushing to tables because it seems she had too many tables and customers to deal with. 
- Leave a pitcher of ice water on the tables for self service

Overall, hubs and I were satisfied customers and have returned several times.  We'll be making Tokyo Sushi Buffet our regular weekend buffet place because we like it better than the other one we've been going to."}
{"text":"It's supposed to be impossible to give a positive review of a sushi buffet, right? The fish has to be awful quality. The sushi can't possibly be well-prepared. There's just...no...way. Right?

Well, oddly enough, that's not the case with the Tokyo Sushi Buffet. The sushi is actually pretty good. I've never eaten a piece of nigiri or sashimi and thought that something was \"off\" about it, and trust me, I've experienced that at quite a few sushi places in Pittsburgh. Granted, you're not going to get the greatest cut of fish you've ever eaten, but they can't exactly serve up toro when you're paying so little for the experience. So, do you get what you pay for? Yes...and way, way more. The quality of the fish and sushi variety is well above what you pay for, but naturally, the rolls aren't perfect and you're not going to get the visual plating experience you ultimately pay for at other sushi restaurants. For me, that's hardly a complaint. If you wanted sushi I to look at I'd go to Umi. If you want sushi to eat, your palate will likely be satisfied - and your wallet will be thankful - at Tokyo Sushi Buffet.

One of the best things about the buffet, is that a lot of the selection disappears pretty quickly, so you know you're getting fresh sushi when you walk up. If you stick with the more popular sushi in their selection, you'll feel comfortable with the freshness, as the chefs are fast to replace the stuff that runs out.

Another good thing, and really, the true benefit of a buffet (aside from the gluttonous accessibility) is the variety of food. Yes, it's labeled as a \"sushi buffet,\" but they have a variety of hot foods on the opposite side of the buffet for the people in your group who aren't into the idea of sushi. While I'm not a huge fan of their hot food, its existence at the buffet is a benefit. All of your typical items are there: general tso's chicken, chicken & brocolli, sweet & sour chicken, noodles, rice, etc. You just won't be writing home about any of it. The variety of rolls, nigiri options, \"special\" rolls, and sashimi won't overwhelm you, but it should suffice. Not to mention, they also have hibachi and a mongolian bbq station.

The restaurant does a good job of keeping it clean, as far as buffet standards go, and the service (for drinks and getting rid of your plates, that is) is usually very good. Plus, the waitresses have always been very nice, which is a bonus.

Granted, I haven't eaten hibachi, or had takeout from there, so my focus is mostly on the sushi, but the way I see it is pretty simple. The sushi is good for your typical Pittsburgh-quality sushi. It's as good (if not better) as places like Nakama, and if you typically eat 2 - 3 rolls during a meal at a sushi restaurant, you'll already make out on the price. Why overpay for average sushi when a place like this exists? It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I really like this place! 

Ok, I admit that I still get a little freaked when I hear the words \"sushi\" and \"buffet\" in the same sentence, but there was nothing scary here.

The rolls are very generous and fresh. They do some interesting things with sauces as well. They make this wasabi-ish sauce that is killer (couldn't quite figure out what the other components were though), that you are meant to drizzle over the mussels. These things were HUGE as well, and fresh. Yellow Tail sushi is my absolute weakness, and I was so pleased with the fish/rice ratio- perfect! 

Service was prompt and friendly. The only confusing part was the signage above the rolls on the buffet, which were completely mixed up (I am pretty sure the sign above the chicken nuggets- yeah they have those for a non-adventurous pallet- was not supposed to read Spicy Tuna Roll). So perhaps the kids hanging out near the coy pond were playing a joke? 

Either way, for $11.99 you can have a laugh as you try to figure out what you are eating, which could be kinda fun."}
{"text":"Everything looked great, but unfortunately nothing tasted great.  Everything tasted pretty much the same, bland.  The price is great at lunch, but I'm not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"I am truly impressed by this sushi/hibachi/chinese food buffet.  I've seen sushi on a buffet before but only with a few lack-luster choices of rolls amongst a chinese-laden buffet.
I wasn't expecting such an assorted array of chinese food, sushi, sashimi, rolls, habashi offerings, fruit, soup, and dessert.  And quality was decent, as well.  Who knew you could get all this from a buffet?"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi.
You can't expect high end for $10.99 at lunch. Good enough for the price and convenience. Service is pretty \"meh\". Not bad not good. Just sorta non existent. But it's ok because you are helping and serving yourself. Food is ok. Nothing that'll be earth shattering but good enough.
The hot foods were slightly disappointing as they are sort if flavorless and bland.

BUT. given the price and the variety, worthy of a visit. I won't crave their food but may or may not drop by for the convenience factor."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi, sashimi and hand rolls. They have something for everyone including an area for hibachi and lots of other warm and cold foods. They will also cook Mongolian-style if you want to choose your own ingredients in that area. The price for a weekend buffet is very high, but if you choose salmon, tuna, crab legs and some of the speciality items it is probably a better deal. During the weekdays it costs about $11 which seems very reasonable. Was surprised to see that they had red bean and green tea ice cream which are a real treat!"}
{"text":"What a great find here in Pittsburgh.  Delicious oysters, steamed crab legs, fresh sushi and creatively made sushi rolls. And if you have room, the hot food is really good too!  Great service only solidified the fact that I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of sushi buffets as long as I don't get food poisoning after going to them.  I've been to Tokyo Sushi Buffet a few times and have enjoyed it every time.  Lunch during the week is a great value at $11.  Come here hungry like I do and you can easily put away 40 pieces of sushi.  It might be a little tough to move after that but they won't rush you out the door at lunch time since they aren't usually packed.  Drinks are refilled quickly and empty plates are removed by the time you get back with a new plate of food.

Now on to the quality and selection of the food.  They make a decent selection of Nigiri for lunch time including red snapper, salmon, white tuna, regular tuna, squid, shrimp and a couple more.  They also have a bunch of standard rolls and even a couple vegetarian rolls.  The specialty rolls that they make are quite good considering they're making a bunch of them for a buffet.  The 2 that jump to mind are ones filled with shrimp tempura and topped with spicy tuna and the rainbow roll.

I think they also have all you can eat hibachi cooked food and a bunch of prepared food items.  I can't comment on these since I go just for the sushi.  They have a full row of desserts as well but by the time you get to them, you've probably eaten too much so they might not appeal to you.  The almond cookies are great, when they have them and the red bean ice cream is decent.

All in all, I like going to this place when I'm in the mood to eat a lot of food.  Probably shouldn't go too often though since I don't want to get mercury poisoning like Jeremy Piven."}
{"text":"If you like sushi or sashimi, this is truly a great place for you. If you only come here for Asian food and Hibachi, I wont' recommend. 

Lots of sushi to choose from and most of them were average or better on freshness and cut. My typical choices are Tuna, Salmon, and Eel which they provided nice options. I really liked the Spicy tuna salad.

Other cooked dishes, however, were not that impressive. They were just to loaded with soy sauce and sugar. 

The fruit options are decent and fresh. I didn't like when they ran out green tea and red bean ice cream and had no intention to refill them.

The services were pretty good. However they charged my 4 year old $9.99 for her meal who only ate the soy beans and two dumplings."}
{"text":"This is a sushi/chinese/asian buffet. As far as buffet's go this is actually pretty top notch. I was pleasantly surprised!

Typically if you go to a buffet you get sushi that has lots of rice, and not alot of fish. But this place has huge pieces of fish on every sushi they put out, they even have hand rolls, and sashimi! What sushi buffet has sashimi???!!!! Although i do have to say that you can tell the quality of the fish products is not top notch... something about the taste seems a bit bland?


The chinese portion of the buffet is also delicious, though I tend to not focus on that a lot. I would definetly recommend if you feel like going to chow down with a friend or two."}
{"text":"Keeping in mind that Tokyo Sushi Buffet is indeed a buffet and none of the rolls are made to order and are churned out one after another, this place isn't too bad.  Being new to sushi, and my Partner In Cuisine loving sushi, I realized that we could not go our entire relationship without me at least attempting to like sushi.  What I like about this place is that I  could try a variety of sushi without having to commit to anything in particular.  Through this, I have learned what I like (and what I don't like!).  In addition to the selection of sushi, there is also a good amount of Asian buffet standards and even crab legs for dinner.  If you want to leave on a good note, stay away from the desserts.  They are just terrible.

My only warning is that Tokyo Sushi Buffet is a little pricey - especially a weekend dinner.  If you're only looking for sushi and don't care about the extras such as the crab legs, I'd suggest going for a weekday lunch to get the best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"An actual overload of food.  The overload isn't so much a good thing either.  I usually do my best to stay away from buffets unless it's a Ron Swanson approved breakfast buffet, but having an Asian wife it's hard to stay away.  It seems like any time there is a party we get invited to the Tokyo and neither of us really want to go.  Each time we find stuff that is palatable and somewhat enjoyable.  I must say the sushi isn't all that bad and for the price it's pretty crazy how decent it is.  The cleanliness is above par for this kind of place as well and makes me think I am not in a giant buffet.  
All that being said I wouldn't go here on my own, I'd find a small local joint that does a few dishes very well instead of hundreds of dishes poorly to pretty well.  
If you must go I'd recommend their sushi rolls -- the sashimi isn't fresh enough and the chinese fare just doesn't cut it in my book.  I usually load up on rolls, crab rangoon, and steamed dumplings.  Then get a scoop of green tea ice cream.

Pros
Sushi Overload
Clean
Attentive Wait Staff
Prices

Cons
Sushi Overload
Too many dishes 
Chinese food isn't very good
It's a buffet."}
{"text":"I'm from California and I have been to a lot of sushi buffets both in Northern and Southern CA, as well as some in Philadelphia. This place was just okay. Nothing spectacular or memorable and the buffet setup itself was smaller than I expected. I came here on a Friday night and I feel like I did eat $21 worth of food (or at least I hope I did). There wasn't really one thing I liked most out of the others, however there were some items that I did not enjoy: the raw oysters and clams; after eating them, I was praying I wouldn't get food poisoning! The sashimi, you could tell was frozen before. The scoop your own ice cream was really soft and pretty gross and foamy. I think they needed to freeze the ice cream longer. One of the downsides was that the dessert section wasn't appetizing, which is sad since I love ending my meal with delicious desserts. One last thing that I found was annoying was how the majority of items was mislabeled or had no label at all. I mean, what was in that deep fried meat in my sushi? Chicken? Pork? Shrimp? I still don't know... Overall, the buffet was alright. I have had much better though so I dont think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Every time we want sushi we go here.  They have a HUGE, AWESOME selection!  And you can't beat the price or the service (we have never had bad service)."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Restaurant ever!  Great price.  Friendly staff. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"I like to write long reviews to boast my food elitism but for this I'll keep it simple: 
One of the best deals in Pittsburgh and it's delicious. Everything I ever wanted is here."}
{"text":"This place was reported closed on Yelp but I submitted a change to say it was not because I just ate there recently!

Found this place when I was picking up car parts from a fellow car guy in Pittsburg. I timed it where I would eat there for late lunch early dinner. This place was a little bit weird to find but alas I found it on a hill next to Best Buy. I almost missed it but glad I found it!

One thing that stood out was that they had Red Tuna Sashimi as AYCE portion which is unheard of in many places. I took advantage of that and ate my weight in Red Tuna there. The sushi rolls are aplenty and you will find rolls you will like.

They have a full selection of desert and sweet items too once your done with the Sushi and hot buffet items.

If sushi is not your thing, they have an array of typical Chinese buffet items which I did not try a lot of but the ones I did try tasted pretty good. Even if your not a sushi lover but looking for a Chineese buffet, everyone will leave satisfied and full when coming to Tokyo Sushi Buffet.

Over all, this place gets a solid 4 star and I will be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Overall:

Had a very good lunch experience here. They had everything I wanted ...decent sushi, typical chinese buffet soups and buffet food, sesame dessert balls, and green tea ice cream. I was very excited when I got the check because it was only like $11 per person...nice! I thought it was totally worth it. 

Details:
I say \"decent\" sushi because overall it was not bad and pretty fresh. The nigiri (raw fish slices over rice) had nice, thick slices of fish, which was great. They also had a huge variety of Maki, my only thing is that some were a bit soggy, and flavor was just ok. Not bad, but don't expect anything super amazing. Love the dessert bar!!

But anyways..would definitely come back because of the good price. Good job Tokyo! :)"}
{"text":"There is a huge selection of sushi but the hot food selections though plentiful were not hot! In fact they weren't even warm:( Hope they fix this because it's not only a health code violation but deterred from food."}
{"text":"the sushi and sashmi selection is huge! however, their hot food is ok.. nothing spectacular compared to some of the chinese buffets. 
but i came for the sushi and i was pleased by the selection and the freshness despite it being a buffet. sashmi could be cut a little thinner. that's the only sushi complaint. it's a bit pricey for the area (but since they are the only sushi buffet in the area, they have the room to charge that much) 

minus a star because for that price, I can get an even larger selection in nyc but it's an excellent choice for sushi in pittsburgh :)"}
{"text":"The best seafood buffet in Pittsburgh. Everything was awesome here. The only thing I want to complain is that my stomach is too small."}
{"text":"Definitely a good sushi buffet deal. There was a wide variety of sashimi and rolls that were pretty good quality. There is also some hot foods in the buffet (Chinese style) and teppanyaki which I ended up ignoring almost completely. Nothing too out there (as expected) but go if you're a sushi lover."}
{"text":"I just called this restaurant and they are still in business.  I will update the rating as soon as I try them.

{"text":"I visited Pittsburgh for the day and saw this buffet on the way. Seeing from pictures it looked amazing.

When I finally made it, the food there was actually better then I expected. My only down side was some of the sushi keeps falling off. The price was a little high, but it was worth it. I would go back again if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"Definately have come a long way since they 1st open.....very nice diverse buffet for ppl that do and do not enjoy sushi.sushi is fresh and pleasantly displayed with labels, other foods are kept filled and hot, major bonus there! Staff is friendly and fast and very accomodating...even sat us where a small tv was to allow for entertain my 2yr old(turned it to sprout and did this on there own accord!!!!)"}
