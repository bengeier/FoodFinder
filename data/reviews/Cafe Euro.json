{"text":"Just overpriced bar food (and apparently Italian). I was running out of time for lunch, so I figured what the hell. The menu had standard bar fare and some pasta items. It is very pricey for a lunch menu with most items ranging around $15. The restaurant was pretty busy and I imagine this is because of its prime location. I had a cheese burger ($9.95). It was nothing special but it came with mayo. What is this, Canada?

{"text":"I was brought here for lunch.  The place is located in the tallest building in Pittsburgh, The Steel Tower, so it seems pretty fancy from the outside and when you walk in.  It's got a huge, modern looking dining room and was packed for lunch.  I was really hungry, so of course I went for a hoagie.  I ordered their Godfather hoagie ($10.95).  It comes with sopressata, capicolla, prosciutto, pepperoni, mozzarella, roasted red peppers, lettuce and tomato.  Of course I ordered it with fries, but you can also get a side of veggies or the starch of the day (which was baked potato).  When the sandwich arrived it was a good size, they put the leaf of lettuce and the two slices of tomato on the side, the bread was like a french baguette. I think it was way too thick for sandwich bread, it just got in the way of the meat. There was lots and lots of meat, then a big slab of roasted red pepper and cheese melted on it.  I am not a fan of big slabs of roasted red pepper, so I removed that.  I basically just ate the meat and cheese and fries.  I deconstructed the hoagie.  It was trying to be too fancy for me.  I like a plain ol' sub roll, stuffed with meat and cheese and shredded lettuce and tomato.  All my dining partners got burgers, which didn't look that great to me either.  I won't go back unless I have no choice."}
{"text":"Just saw a sign on the window that said Cafe Euro is leaving as of 11/19/10 and Damon's will be opening up there.  Interesting....should be a good spot before Penguins games!"}
{"text":"A pleasant contemporary atmosphere.  The menu offered standard choices and nothing struck my fancy.  Although my field green salad with balsamic vinaigrette was excellent.  As a final note, I would not eat here again.  But I would walk by to gaze at the awesome steel columns of the US Steel Tower which this restaurant resides.  My actual rating for this restaurant would be 2 1/2 stars.  So I gave rating a boost and rounded up."}
