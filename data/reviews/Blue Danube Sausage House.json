{"text":"I love this place. I don't live close by but will drive there for their meats! The best deli meats around. Don't leave without getting yourself a few \"bacon chips\". They are insane."}
{"text":"I love the place, my whole family has been going there for years and they mostly always have everything from pig ears to salami and bacon biscuits to package things you can't always get at other stores."}
{"text":"They have all sorts of Hungarian goodies that I love and miss. Pastries, chocolates and my fav cold cuts. If your here during lunch, have a crepe (palacsinta) and an enormous Schnitzel sandwhich, which are delicious and enough for two! I'd avoid coming here on the weekends because you'll get pushed aside quickly by all the people in the store. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of five is because of the bitter tall red head lady who never cracks a smile. The rest of the staff are quite friendly or at the very least, will serve you. Go for the food."}
{"text":"The absolute best in Schnitzel and bacon biscuits .  If you want the best in spicy beef jerky this is the place to buy it from.  Must make a special trip out there for a schnitzel sometime."}
{"text":"This place is always on of my stops when I am back home.  The bacon biscuits are reason enough to stop in, but you also NEED to try a schnitzel sandwich.    Everything is homemade from scratch by the friendly Hungarians who run the store.  While you're there also pick up some smoked sausage (I mean, it's in their name), and some frozen cabbage rolls for later!"}
{"text":"\"Spoil Alert.\"  I'm of Hungarian decent, born and raised.  This business was sold a few years ago to a German dude.  Since the business take over I find the quality of the products mainly from the deli counter have declined drastically.  I've often encountered that it's either not fresh or even developing mold.  I cannot speak for the hot table food personally but the rest of my family likes it.  The Pogacsa (Snones) are always fresh and tasty as well as the rye breads.  The deserts are not always so fresh.  As for the remainder of the items on the shelves I find very pricey.  What really turns me off of this place is dispite that the owner comes across as being friendly I find that there is a strange undertone about him and the manner in the way he communicates with his female servers.  I have been in there on a few occasions where I was being served and have had to listen to him yelling at another employee.  For this reason I will not give this place my business.  I find the owner's behavior very appauling."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of swine, Blue Danube is decorated with variants on this theme- sausages seem to be the specialty, but keep an eye out for the poppyseed roll. This was by far the standout on this trip out to Toronto! With the bias that saran preserves what remains of old pastry, I was shocked to bite into a supple dough, loaded with a super moist, poppyseed and raisin filling. The filling-to-dough ratio definitely defied the price point. The staff were friendly, in their own way. While efficiently organizing the flow of customers, and curtly responding to questions, the ladies displayed a special hospitality when it came to sampling the variety of unlabeled sausages stacked in the glass case.  The universal language of sausage appreciation settled in with their enthusiasm and eagerness to share the joy of their cured pork products, as they doled out slices of their favorites."}
{"text":"Like Lily B said - schnitzel and bacon biscuits!   I never have them make my schnitzel sandwiches - the schnitzel itself is cheap but once you start loading up a sandwich, it gets kinda pricey.  Their bacon biscuits are heaven. Enough said."}
{"text":"The European style butchers that once inhabited every second corner in Toronto are a vanishing breed, but fortunately for those seeking Hungarian delicacies, there remains the Blue Danube Sausage House. This is old school - there is the meat counter where you can choose from an assortment of charcuterie, the freezer section where you can pick up prepared goods, the dessert counter where you can satisfy your sweet tooth, the rack of fresh breads, a small hot table where you can fill the hole with that delicious schnitzel sandwich, and the dry goods selection where you can fill out your dinner needs. Everybody has an opinion on the best Czabi sausages, but these have to be included in the discussion. Ditto for the head cheese, the meatloaf, the pogaca (okay, that's bread, but it has bacon in it!) and just about everything else there. The freezer is stocked with the essentials - leczo, goulash, soups, and of course, paprika. The dobos torte is awesome, and so is the kremes, in fact, so are all the goodies in the dessert section. And the caraway rye is definitely one of the best in Toronto. I am happy that this place is still around to provide the high quality and harder to find Hungarian goods I am so happy with. Jo etvagyat!"}
{"text":"Schnitzel was good bun fresh garlic mayo garlicky but good only downside raw onions too much Got a pastry of Have to try sausage next time no bacon biscuits left Servers  weren't overly friendly"}
{"text":"Blue Danube Sausage House is the best place in the GTA for Hungarian charcuterie.  They also have Hungarian baked goods, prepared foods and other stuff, but their meat products are where they really shine.  You can smell the smoke as you enter the store.  Any piece of pig that can be smoked is smoked.  They have all types of Hungarian sausages.  Their smoked headcheese is fantastic--OK it's an acquired taste, but it is fantastic."}
{"text":"If you Want a quick filling lunch this is the place ! The schnitzel is HUGE and amazing . You can tell they take pride in what they do ! Also try there crepes . They have amazing deli selection aswell ."}
{"text":"The best in Toronto. Simple as that. Great products, excellent food."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place so I decided to stop in over my lunch to grab some sausages for dinner. It's located on Chauncey, which is just off Islington (south of Bloor) - an industrial-type street.  They have enough parking for about five cars (I think) right at the front but there's ample street parking as well.   I was kind of surprised when I went in because it's quite small.  There were only three people working there at the time so I had to wait a little bit but, no big deal, I wasn't in a hurry.  I was served by the older lady and, honestly, I wished the blonde guy had of served me because he was so friendly that I could have asked him for some suggestions on smoked sausages - maybe next time I'll talk to him.  Anyway, I ended up getting three Double Garlic sausages and one Hot Hungarian, which, by the way, when grilled and coupled with Dimpflmeier's hot dog buns, were out of this world - we're definitely going to get them again as they were exceptional!  Better than anything at St. Lawrence Market.  Really, really that good!  Since a lot of people were coming in for the schnitzel sandwich, I decided to try one too.  The piece of schnitzel itself was only $5.00; however, the (small) sandwich was $7.00 and I had to pay extra for pickles but I'm not sure if I got charged extra for the garlic mayonnaise.  I don't really quite understand how they can justify charging $2.00 for a Kaiser bun and charging extra for some pickles but, anyhow, it's not like I have Hungarian schnitzel everyday. The entire bill (four sausages and the sandwich) came to just under $20.00.  As for the schnitzel sandwich, I was a little disappointed because I expected the meat to be hot (not room temperature).  The small sandwich was so HUGE that I could only eat half and I was extremely full afterwards.  I liked the combination of the garlic mayonnaise and the kosher dills; the Kaiser bun was nice quality - very fresh. I'm still on the fence with the schnitzel itself though - maybe because it wasn't hot.  Nevertheless, it wasn't greasy but, not like I'm an aficionado on schnitzel, still I've had better.  I gave my husband the other half; he ate it for \"breakfast\" the next morning and thought it was outstanding.  He went on and on about how great it was and how quickly he ate it and wished there were more!  I definitely plan to return in the near future so I can try and assortment of the smoked sausages and more of those Hot Hungarians!"}
{"text":"Schnitzel is amazing - only $5 and HUGEEE! Also get the hot peppers on yours. Unless you are 300 lbs or an extremely hungry Asian this sandwich is a meal for two. Just be careful for the senior citizens driving through this area. You may get run over by grey dawn."}
{"text":"What a great place to get a sandwich!  Pork Schnitzel and  sausage sandwiches were delicious. The bean and ham soup was piping hot and delicious!  We are visiting from out of town - if we lived here we'd definitely be back for their mouthwatering charcuterie."}
