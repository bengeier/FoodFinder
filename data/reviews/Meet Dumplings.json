{"text":"I have been going to this place on a regular base for over two years. I love their home made dumplings from scratch, also they are very flexible to make the flavour you like. It is not a fancy place, but it is clean and home cooking."}
{"text":"Amazing! Ask  about the specials. The mackerel fish fried dumplings are unreal!"}
{"text":"Not bad, definite bonus points for location  After watching a show at Panasonic Theatre, we decided to try this place out. Appeared new as we hadn't noticed it before. We stuck to some basics: onion pancake and fried pork & chive dumplings. We ordered a coke, we wanted some ice but they don't have any. Really??  The onion pancake was alright. The dumplings took a long time, strange as we were the only ones in the restaurant. They were tasty though.  A young hostess kept coming by to check on us, she was very sweet. And they kept filling up our tea; I guess the food is salty!  Overall, not bad for a dumpling snack. I would go back, but I'm not rushing..."}
{"text":"I think it's overpriced for dumplings.  The skin of the shanghai dumplings is too thick and therefore not authentic at all.  I haven't gone back since my friends took me there and said it's there favourite dumpling place.  There are better ones."}
{"text":"I do not get the high rating. Was there trying out their pan fried lamb dumplings, pan fired pork and chives dumplings, fried onion pancake and fried noodles. The dumpling is average at best. The onion pancake is tasteless and too thick, like eating card board. The noodles is super super oily. What's worst was they cooked with used oil from frying the dumplings. This is not home cook meal, you do not reuse oil on a totally different dish. We can taste the used oil. It's telling me the restauranteurs are either inexperience or think they can get away with sloppy half ass skills. Not a place I would recommend or return."}
{"text":"Came here b/c my friend was craving dumplings. It's Friday, just before noon, so you would think that they would be expecting a lunch crowd...but no. The place is very bare bones and there was only one waitress, who I think was the owner/mother. She spoke very poor english so it was hard to get our orders in to her. Poor lady was rushing around and yelling mandarin to someone (no idea who) but she was really busy so I felt bad. The wait was long though, so one couple just up and left. Order came out wrong but it took about an additional 30 minutes and we were rushed on time so just ate what we were given. Boiled dumplings were tasty and just the right amount of food. Obviously fresh made which was good. Overall, would eat from here again, but maybe just takeout."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Finally, a dumpling place in the Yonge/Bloor area.  Close to work.  Would have made a great lunch spot.  Unfortunately, I just could not bring myself to give Dumpling Queen more than 2 stars after my latest visit.  My friend and I ordered the steamed lamb dumplings, the pork and cabbage fried dumpling, and the onion pancake.  All dishes that a dumpling restaurant should excel at.  All missed the spot.    Overwhelmingly, the dishes were too salty.  All I could taste from the two dumpling dishes was salt.  I may have tasted a \"hint\" of lamb in the lamb dumplings, but the saltiness overpowered its flavour.  The fried dumpling was completely unmemorable but for the salt.  Onion pancake, a disaster.  Thick and tasteless - I felt like I was eating a wad of dough, pressed flat and then fried.    Looks like I will need to continue on my hunt for a better lunch place in the area."}
{"text":"My go-to place downtown for dumplings!  I usually order one of the boiled variety and one of the pan fried. The boiled consists of such cute, round dumplings that are so flavourful and juicy. The pan fried dumplings here are possibly the best pan fried I've ever had. They're wrapped in a unique way (not how dumplings are usually wrapped), and it comes with a beautiful, crispy bottom that is SO delicious to nibble on. Each order of boiled comes with 15 dumplings, while the pan fried comes with 12. That is more than enough to fill two people's bellies, and at such cheap prices too!  Other dishes I've tried: Last time I went, I ordered the Yeung Chow fried rice with BBQ pork, and I have to admit, it was quite dry and not very flavourful. Adding some soy sauce did help. Even still, this does not affect the five-star rating I've given because the dumplings are the stars of the show here!  The service is fantastic. The servers are friendly and come around every so often to refill my tea cup without me having to ask! The restaurant itself is decorated very simply, but how a place looks is the least of my concerns when they serve amazing food. Give this place a try if you're looking for some good dumplings to hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Generous portions, good food, good prices. No nonsense kind of place, which I love. Definitely coming back again. Minus one star because the interior is kind of dumpy."}
{"text":"I ordered deep fried spicy chicken Szechuan last night. When we opened the container at home we found the contents inedible. We literally had a box of fatty chicken skin slightly breaded. We picked through the whole box and found a handful of bits of chicken meat. This dish cost me $12.95.  I will never order food there again."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere close by to eat since the place we wanted to eat was closed and we were cold. We had heard a lot of good things from our friends about Dumpling Queen so we decided to try it out. I have many regrets :(   The chairs and table looked clean, but there was a displeasing smell lingering about. The smell combined with the general interior/feel of the place made me want to leave but I pushed through with high hopes.   My boyfriend and I both love noodles so we ordered two noodle dishes and a plate of boiled pork and cabbage dumplings. The dumplings were okay, definitely not bad but nothing special either. I ate a piece right after the sever gave it to us and it was already room temp which was disappointing.   We were craving something home-y so we ordered preserved vegetables and pork noodle soup and shanghai fried noodles. The noodle soup was super bland and despite putting in 5+ spoons of chilli sauce, it was still nothing but bland. A delicious soup base and chilli sauce is important to me so I was very unhappy. Also, the noodles were the same noodles as the shanghai noodles, so we just had a lot of shanghai noodles. The shanghai fried noodles tasted decent but was just so oily. The only pro is that there are lots of vegetables and the portions are huge but when the taste is so mediocre, do you really want a big portion?  Service was below average. I guess they don't give water unless you ask for it? But tbh I don't know if I'd trust it. I asked for bowls which we never got and when my boyfriend asked for a take-out box (but why did we pack it home?? I may just throw it out), the server cut him off to talk to another table. The lady cashier was also pretty rude when we were trying to pay. Never again."}
{"text":"Dumpling here is really good. I tried noodles too. It was unique but I don't want to have it again."}
{"text":"Very good authentic northern Chinese dumplings. One of the best hot & sour soups I've had. Genuine and friendly staff.  There's no doubt I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"food is yummy! And totally worth the price given the hugeeee portions!  And the service is pretty friendly! Will I go back though? Meh, i don't know.  My score is 2.5 actually not 3"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I've enjoyed the dumplings, but not the non-dumpling dishes. The gai lan I once ordered was pretty fibrous and the green-onion pancakes were not flaky and pretty stiff. The service is inconsistent: sometimes great and sometimes awful. If you get anything from here, you'll probably want to take it out, since the restaurant interior is pretty ugly and not all that clean. There's also very limited seating."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went there last week. Not a fancy place, but price and foods are decent. We tried double cooked pork and noodle. We both happy with the tastes, We will go again."}
{"text":"The waiters are very friendly and provide excellent service. The food is really deliecious especially the fried rice with tomatoes and eggs. The price is very reasonable and the food is in a pretty large portion. I would recommend this restaurant and its excellent overall!!!"}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I will never go back to this place because the taste of dishes here is too disappointing....never ever go back!"}
{"text":"Hole in a wall, great FRESH dumplings (spinach and mushroom). Satisfied with our food. Too bad it was Good Friday or we would have tried the pork dumplings which looks really good. We would come back in a heartbeat just for the dumplings."}
{"text":"The pork and cabbage dumplings are great! The pork and chive are good too! Other dishes here are disappointing and the wonton soup is a joke; basically just hot water with a few pieces of green onion and the wonton in it but no flavor at all. The people working there are nice and it seems to attract a lot of asian diners, which is a good sign of authentic food in my opinion! Overall, a good restaurant that needs to put the same effort into all their dishes as they do the dumplings, because those are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I frequent Dumpling Queen on a monthly basis. Not only can my lunch date and I split a $20 meal, but we can get in and out in under 40 minutes, and the dumplings are delicious. I recommend the panfried mushroom and the vegetable steamed dumplings. If you're starving and have a huge hankering for tofu, the fried tofu dish is massive and will fill everyone at your table. Stear clear of the crab."}
{"text":"Was very excited to see a dumpling place closer to the Yonge/Bloor area.   I got 2 types of fzn dumplings to go - pork+fennel and pork, shrimp, and chives - both were amazing, and the price was great."}
{"text":"I am guessing this place is new because I'd never noticed it before. My friend and I were supposed to meet up for a coffee but he was hungry so we checked it out. I had actually just come from eating but my friend hates eating alone and dumplings are snacky so I ordered a plate of pork & chive (15 pieces, $6.95). I thought they would be steamed but I guess they are boiled, as per Steph L.'s review. I hadn't planned to eat them all but I did. It's not that they were so spectacular, but they were very light, all 15 of them!! I was pretty full but I couldn't stop eating! It didn't help matters that my friend, who had just come from the gym, ordered another plate of 15 assorted dumplings ($7.95; mushroom and spinach, lamb, and some other pork option), bok choi, and garlic cucumbers ($4.95)!! I think the dumpling skins may have been homemade?  I think they boil pretty much everything here, unless you order something fried. The bok choi was a bit too soggy for me and they didn't really put anything on it, although there was a small blob of starchy sauce underneath on one side but it wasn't enough to give the whole plate much flavour. I had never heard of this garlic cucumber but it reminded me a bit of this cucumber thing my mom does, Korean styles. This dish was a heaping pile of cucumber chunks bathed in vinegar, sugar, sesame oil and something else with coarsely chopped cilantro which made for a refreshing change from the meat in the dumplings. I liked it.   I don't know if their style of dumpling is of some particular region of China, but it definitely didn't have any HK edge to it and I haven't really had dumplings like these elsewhere. They also have things like fried rice and other rice/noodle dishes, etc. The place had a pretty decent flow of traffic coming and going during the hour or so that we were there, mostly visa students? both dine-in and take-out. There appeared to be a lot of regulars for such a new place. The service was OK, but it was kind of annoying how one would have to ask for common things (cutlery, napkins, plates, a straw) and they'd bring each item one at a time so getting started took a bit of time. I don't expect five-star service at a place like this but maybe a little common sense. If in the area and in need of a dumpling fix, I'll be stopping in again."}
{"text":"Overpriced in comparison to competitors and overall low quality.  \"Three kinds seafood noodles\" - only noticeable seafood was tiny shrimps. Not sure what is 'three kinds'; just salty soy sauce based, no good flavour  Sweet and sour pork - noted as \"chinese style\" - this sounds very confusing - super thin slices of pork covered in massive amounts of batter - resulting in just grease and batter.  Eggplant - usually it's okay but last time the oil and grease separated out and was clearly seen in the styrofoam foam takeout container. Which points again to the quality - styrofoam but also the takeout chopsticks are short and weak.  The dumplings are the best bet if you do order, but they are overpriced."}
{"text":"Now I don't have to wander down to Chinatown to get my dumpling fix!  Walking down Yonge, I noticed Tasty Asian Cuisine was no longer and Dumpling Queen has taken it's place.  They have a large front window where you can see the dumplings being made.  $6.95 - $7.95 for 15 dumplings boiled $6.95 - $7.95 for 12 dumplings pan fried  I ordered the boiled pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings to go. They were made to order fresh... and not bad! The dough was nice and thin. However, I wish they didn't use the same water to boil all the dumplings. Someone previously must have ordered shrimp because I could taste it.  A few days later, I was in the mood for some Chinese comfort food and decided to get take-out.    I told them about the shrimp-tasting dumplings and they were really nice about it saying that next time they should swap the water out.  I ordered off the \"Tofu, Vegetables\" menu and requested the \"braised eggplants & tofu with chili sauce\".  They told me that they would make sure it wasn't near any shrimp. Ok, that's cool (I'm not actually allergic to shrimp).  I was a bit confused, the dish didn't have shrimp in the description and it's under the \"Tofu,Vegetables\" section.  I got home and found that they had thrown in minced spicy pork with loads and loads of oil.  I'm not a vegetarian, but sometimes I don't feel like eating meat.  If you are vegetarian, make sure you let them know. I think they would be really nice about it and accommodating. But, double check.  Even though my meals here haven't been perfect, I still like the place. The staff is super nice and I'll keep coming here for takeout. A little bit of Chinatown near Yonge and Bloor!"}
{"text":"This is always the first spot I come to when I'm in TO. Dumplings are phenomenal and very authentic. Chive, Egg & Shrimp or Lamb are my 2 favourites but you can't go wrong with any. I usually get them steamed but they are really good panfried as well."}
{"text":"Their food is awful, worst Chinese food I got. When I pay, the waitress just randomly gave me a price, $30 for 2 dishes. I asked coz I remember the price on the menu was 7 to 10 for both dishes, she was like\" it's tax\". so I calculated in front of her with the price she gave me, there is still $3 gap. Finally, she told me she added the tip already. so she just randomly increased the price WITHOUT TELLING ME. Disappointed. :( would never come again.   The table besides me got the wrong dish, but the waiter is like, it's ok, try the new dish without trying to solve the problem or giving discount. The guy ended up pay for the wrong dish."}
{"text":"The service is soooo bad, not polite at all. I used to love eat food at this place, but NOT anymore. If they keep treating the customers like that, I have to say they will lose all of them!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a dining experience this restaurant is not for you. If you want a bowl of wonton soup, where the wonton are good and the broth is delicate, take a large container home and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great dumplings! Toronto is well-covered from the west end Dumpling House to the east end Dumpling Queen.  They also have delivery here on just eat so hear ye, hear ye students! Buy dumplings and use the extra cash on your inebriations!"}
{"text":"This is a chinese restaurant specializing in homemade dumplings. The dumplings are somewhat okay but pricey compared to restaurants in Chinatown due to some \"creative accounting\". The noodle & rice dishes seem authentic but the taste is just not there. Service is below standard I don't even know why they are a full service restaurant. Don't feel guilty if you don't leave a tip.  If you are so desperate for dumplings and don't want to trek all the way to Chinatown, sure, give them a try and hope you don't get bamboozled.  I have to emphasize before paying, insist on seeing an itemized bill.  This business will sometimes overcharge you by either adding an automatic gratuity or coming up with an amount that suits them.  Very dishonest business practice."}
{"text":"I'm not asian enough to go to dumpling shops so this was my first one! I was excited to try something new on top of being suuuuper hungry! The restaurant is somewhat small but can fit a decent number of people given their table arrangements and the lengthy size. It was almost like a long hallway. It was simple-looking and neutral.  I had the Preserved Vegetables and Shredded Pork Noodle Soup along with 2 orders of the 3 choice dumplings (one set pan fried and one set steamed). Food came out in a timely manner but let me tell you, the noodle soup was AMAAAAAZING! I've had a lot of the Preserved Vegetables and Shredded Pork Noodle Soup versions uptown but this was by far the best one I've had! Uptown ones were a lot lighter but here I found it was perfectly balanced and the preserved vegetables tasted stronger. Noodles were made perfectly too. The dumplings were quite good as well although I wasn't a huge fan of the spinach and mushroom dumpling...something tasted off about it. The pan fried dumplings were yummy and not too thick unlike some other places.  Service was not bad and I am definitely returning to try the other kinds of dumplings they have to offer. I want to also try their other dishes and soups too like their hot and sour soup! It's a pretty good place if you asked me and if you are looking to get your dumpling fix and you are in the dt area, this would be a decent pick!"}
{"text":"Dumpling is too salty and not fresh. Couldn't tell much differences between dumplings with different fillings. Heard the other table is complaining about the taste of the dumpling being too salty and no taste of vegetables, the server just yelled back \"why no other customers complain about it? it can't be bad.\"  Ordered two dishes both under 7 dollars, how come the bill is $18 dollars in total?"}
{"text":"I just visitedDumpling Queen for lunch and the dumplings were excellent! I lived in China for several years and the food at Dumpling Queen really brought me back.  I ordered the $7.95 3-dumpling combo where you can choose 3 types of dumplings for a total of 15 dumplings. I chose the shrimp, chive/egg/shrimp, and the spinach/mushroom dumplings - each was delicious. I also had the green onion pancake and it was quite tasty as well for $4.95 if I recall correctly.  The service was friendly and quick, and I even bought two bags of dumplings (15 each) to take home for quick dinners.  I'll definitely be back and recommend to anyone looking for delicious dumplings."}
{"text":"Dumplings are good but the noodle soup was SO BAD. They only take cash if it's under 15 dollars or something"}
{"text":"I  was looking for a late-night meal after a long flight and found this place open after 10 p.m.  The ladies were still making fresh dumplings inside the front window.  I ordered the boiled cabbage and pork dumplings.  Delicious, fresh, stomach-warming and delicate!  Took half home with me for a great breakfast the next morning.  They were good cold, too.  Service was very friendly and the feel of the place welcoming, cheerful, and upbeat.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here a few weeks back after stumbling across it on our way to another place for lunch. It has a fairly unassuming front and seemed like a good spot to try.  I wish it were a tad cleaner on the inside.   Prices were reasonable.  Dumplings: We had the trio of pan fried and boiled. They were all pretty good but when you have them all on the plate in no particular order, we couldn't tell what we were eating until we bit into them. So I ended up eating all of one kind instead of trying all of them.  We also ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein was was excellent. I'm a huge noodle fan and this dish just hit the spot. The noodles were crispy and just soggy enough where the sauce was. Only complaint was there were more toppings than noodles.  Next time I come here I will NOT be sharing the noodles with anyone!"}
{"text":"I walk by here all the time and decided to come in for dinner one day with the gf.  We ordered the onion pancake, pan fried pork dumplings and the boiled shrimp and vegetable dumplings.  They were served up pretty quickly and came out hot.  The onion pancake needed a bit more flavour and was full of more dough than onions.  The pan fried dumplings were decent, and definitely needed dipping sauce for flavour.  The boiled shrimp and veggie ones were a little bland, but the sauces helped.  Service was good and it was nice to see the dumpling queen herself making fresh dumplings by the window.  A great littlw family business located in the heart of Toronto.  I would give this place another shot, the next time I have a dumpling craving."}
{"text":"Decent dumplings with all the fixings. Got the order through Feedback. Quick cooking time and the dumplings are very fresh. Hot and Sour soup was okay...."}
{"text":"In my oppinion, dumpling queen is the king of dumpling places. It has delicious fillings and products for very fair pricing. It's a very central location, better for takeout than sitting experience just due to the limited seating."}
{"text":"they always ask for cash when you order take out. but they never mention about 10% discount when you pay cash unless you ask for it! next time when you pay cash, remember to ask for discount! (don't expect they automatically give you discount coz they dont!)"}
{"text":"Bring a drink or prepare to order a drink. Their water is warm and disgusting. The cups were untouchable.   However! The food was great.   We ordered the Pork & Chinese Cabbage boiled dumplings ($6.95) and Lamb fried dumplings ($7.95). You have the option of fried or boiled for all the dumplings; you get 15 when they're boiled and 12 when they're fried. They were both very good.  The service is non-existent as sketchy Chinese restaurants go and the decor/atmosphere are functional. Kinda like, you don't want to touch too many surfaces, you enjoy the food, and leave. If I ever have another craving for dumplings and I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind coming here. However, I probably wouldn't travel any distance that requires much effort to come to this specific dumpling restaurant."}
{"text":"Like others had said the dumplings aren't as good as before (when it was Dumpling Queen).  We got the pan fried beef dumplings, boiled pork/chive dumplings and a side hot and sour soup. The place is cleaner now so that's definitely a plus. We probably would come back since there is virtually no other place selling dumpling in the area."}
{"text":"Kinda noisy but good food and big portions which are great  for sharing. Bring cash unless you're getting more than $10 worth. Also drink choices are not very many if you want alcohol. Anyways I love the atmosphere. You should try the green beans!"}
{"text":"Please avoid coming here, food is tasteless and salty. Whatever those one start reviews are saying is truth. Just please don't eat here. I did it for you and feel bad for my money and stomach."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. As someone who has eaten dumplings all my life, this place is sub par.   Even before we placed our orders, the menu revealed a flaw. There are NO steamed dumplings. Seriously this is a big flaw for a dumpling place. Steaming is one of the unique ways of cooking Chinese food. In my opinion, the dumpling skin has the best texture when it's steamed.   We ordered pan fried pork/cabbage dumplings and boiled seafood dumplings. Both were underwhelming. The pan fried dumplings were more greasy than I expected. The seafood dumplings might as well have been called veggie dumplings because they barely contained any seafood. I also don't count intimation crab as seafood. At least put some shrimp or fish in there. I didn't taste any.   On top of the lack of steam option, and sub par quality of the dumplings, the value is not even there. I've been to Dumpling King between North York and Finch on Yonge street. Dumpling Queen is about $1 more expensive on all their dumplings AND the portion is smaller. If I recall correctly, Dumpling King gives you 18 pieces per order. Dumpling Queen gives you 12 pieces per pan fried order and 15 per boiled order. You should not think $1 is not much. On a $5.99 item, $1 is a difference if 17%. When you factor in tax and tip it's much more. When you consider the smaller portions its really more like a difference of 60%. I have no reason to come here since it's inferior in nearly every way."}
{"text":"Walked in had mushroom/cabbage as well as shrimp dumplings. Perfectly cooked little shrimpies. Priced well. Taste spot on. Two fried dumplings were perfect for the three of us."}
{"text":"This place must be rebranded or the owner has changed. Not good as usual. They changed the menu and most of the food items but seems to up the price"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here! Dumplings got here fast and were amazing! Definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I waited an hour for dumplings here. Two different people who came after me finished their dumplings before I even received my takeout order. Coincidentally, these were the only two people in the restaurant besides me and the waitress, who acted clueless for 40 minutes before someone came from the kitchen and told her my order had already been sent out. Sent where? Pretty sure she wrapped them up with another person's order half an hour ago.   Of course, I can't really say since none of this was communicated to me directly, but was instead gleaned from the bickering in mandarin going on at the back for another 10 minutes. Then, another 20 minutes spent waiting because they \"boiled the wrong kind of dumplings\". Finally after an hour, I went home with my dumplings.   Let's just say, in an hour, I could have boiled dumplings at home 12 times; and they would have been approximately the same quality."}
{"text":"Great food,  simple service,  350 Budweiser need I say more, the pan fried are my favorite.. Pork and chive all day long"}
{"text":"So this place really deserves 2.5 stars, but since it is fairly new, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and round up to 3.  I'm very critical of dumpling places as I eat quite a bit of them.  I ordered the 3 kind dumpling and had 5 of the lamb, beef and pork with chive and the pork wonton noodle soup.  The noodle soup was okay, nothing special.    As for the dumplings, they were hand made, however all they do is either pan-fry or boil them. I wasn't in the mood for pan fried as it is more greasy and was really in the mood for steamed.  So I ask for boiled instead.  As any Chinese food expert will tell you, the problem with boiled dumplings is that all the flavour escapes into the water whereas steam accentuates/locks in the flavour.  So it was quite disappointing that they couldn't steam them and the boiled dumplings tasted like they were frozen (of the T&T variety) even though they weren't.  I really don't understand how they can't steam it because all you need is a steam basket and it is fairly cheap.  So essentially, all that handmade dumpling effort goes to waste.  I know this is being harsh but their name is Dumpling house so I expected them to be amazing, which they weren't.  So for food I give them 2/5.  As for service, it was very pleasant and they spoke English, which is pleasant (you'd be surprised how many don't speak English for these type of establishments).  I'd give them 3.5/5.  The only reason I wouldn't give them 5/5 is because when they serve you the platter, they don't tell you what is what.  All in all, its not a bad place if you are looking for something to eat, but if you want top notch dumplings, I suggest going to Chinatown or Markam/Richmond Hill.  The lack of steamed dumplings really annoys me."}
{"text":"Love this place! I would give it five stars if it wasn't absolutely freezing in here in the winter (the door is also directly aligned with much of the seating).  They have a great variety of dumplings at a very reasonable price. The rest of the food has always been en pointe and is not overly greasy.   I have been here many times and will keep coming back for the great food and strong service...in the summer that is!"}
{"text":"I came in on a whim since I live close by. The service was friendly and the takeout was fairly quick : under 15 minutes. I had General Tao Chicken. So disappointed! It lacked all the classic General Tao flavours. It was covered in a red sauce but with no salt, garlic, spice, or tang. I feel very ripped off.  I've tried General Tao Chicken from 30+ restaurant's in Toronto.   On a side note: great portion, great white rice, and fresh veggies.  If you go, please go for the Dumplings! Don't make my mistake."}
{"text":"So delicious and such sweet people working there. Authentic Chinese cooking is hard to find but they do it right. Love this place."}
{"text":"Use to love it here and came regularly, but NEVER again!  Use to have the spinach fried dumpling, green beans, and General Tao chicken. Then the service became worse - and it was never their best facet. Then the food became very salty, but when we asked about a change in chef, we were told no.  Then one night we had to walk out in dismay. No half-orders available for the 1st time since after eating there many times and ordering them. Oddly, we were the only non-Asian customers that night. Maybe a coincidence, maybe we were not there target market."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and craving big portions of OK dumplings, this is a great spot. If you're looking for higher quality, spend the extra 20 m to get to Mother's Dumplings.  The texture of the pan fried dumplings (pork n chives) was on point (they were crispier than most) but the only downside was that they were very greasy.  The boiled chicken dumplings were filled to the max and were very satisfying.  Sidenote: CHECK YOUR BILL! The cashier tried to charge me an extra $1/2 which really wasn't nice..."}
{"text":"Well hello, your majesty! it is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance, her grace. My lovely girlfriend and I met your husband, the Dumpling King, nary a month ago (4 stars) and we were most impressed with his royal boiled food bundles, and looking forward to trying milady's own cookery.   We ordered one boiled egg and chive, and one boiled shrimp w/ mixed vegetable, as well as a mixed platter of pan fried (all vegetarian/shrimp).   Your royal servants told us the egg and chive specifically would take quite awhile, and then two minutes later we were served a plate of egg and chive dumplings. I'm not sure if your strategy was to lower our expectations and then deliver way beyond, but I must say: mission accomplished. And i should add that this was no 'peasant's serving' - the egg and chive dumplings were chock full of filling, all of it delicious and fresh tasting.  The second dish delivered were the pan fried mixed variety, and they were served in such a delicately appealing manner that sadly defies a polite description deserving of her royal highness (six-pack abs connected by chocolate snowflakes?) they too were delicious, crunchy, and filled to capacity.  Finally, the boiled shrimp dumplings arrived, and they were as bouncy as I've ever experienced. Top drawer! If you don't reside in a magnificent bouncy castle (which is what I presume) then you certainly cook your dumplings as though you do. Wonderful.  Our meal was accompanied by a regularly refilled bottomless cup of tea, the service was, as mentioned, quick and polite, and we will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food poisoning/upset stomach experienced by both my friend and I after eating here.  I used to eat here all the time.  It's too bad I can't go back after that experience!"}
{"text":"I love dining here, this is a place to feel at home. Every time I go to Toronto I will choose to have my lunch here with some yummy dumplings!"}
{"text":"Now I'm no dumpling expert, but holy trick these were magical!!!!   I came here yesterday with a friend because we were walking down yonge and I was mesmerized by the ladies they had making the dumplings. It was MAGICAL.   Now I kinda know how Brittany Murphy felt in ramen girl, but thats off topic :)  We had the mix ans match plate of fried dumplings for 8 dollars? So cheap!!!!  1) the Lamb were freaking amazing. Spiced with Asian curry I believe. I want an order of this for myself next time  2) the pork n chive...even yummier!!!  3) the shrimp and veg...super good as well!   These are defo some of the best I've ever had other than the soup dumplings from DTF. Those are next level insanity.  Its my goal to be back here ASAP."}
{"text":"i heard this place is like the dumpling house in chinatown... oh but it's really kinda isn't.  the dumplings are smaller, lamb skewers had a lot of tendons and stuff in it, and green beans were soaked in soysauce. it's okay - not great. probably wont be coming here again."}
{"text":"Dumpling queen is so good. I love dumplings. They're amazing. How am I half Asian and did not know that solely eating dumplings for a meal was a thing? The place is super small. The bathroom is downstairs, and the restaurant is narrow with limited seating. The food did take a while to come. The beer was good and the dumplings and beer were EXTREMELY reasonably priced. It is $7 or $8 for an order of dumplings. I've been here a few times and I got the pan fried dumplings because I was under the impression that anything fried is better. This is not the case. I tried my friend's boiled dumplings and I've got to say, I like those better. The pan fried ones are great too but I do like the boiled ones more. The lamb and the pork and chive were my two favourites. This is one of my go-to's in the area. I like eating in here because I like their hot sauce."}
{"text":"The Green Onion Pancake is awful. Don't order it. They put very little green onion in it and the pancake tasted like flour....And cost you 6$. Shame."}
{"text":"Love dumplings? Then you've come to the right place!  They are freshly made to order! It's a small family run shop with authentic Chinese cuisine. The best part is not only are they fantastic, but they're prices can't be beat, pan fried you get 12 for anywhere from 6.95 - 7.95 boiled? same price but you get 15!   I will be returning again and again for these little guys! Lots of options for vegetarians as well!   Give them a try sooner than later!"}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest this place has just \"okay food\". The general tao chicken, and lemon chicken is satisfying, but the dumplings are pretty much the only thing I like from here. I tend to like the lamb or pork fried dumplings."}
{"text":"This place is new so they might be smoothing out kinks.   The bad: service was very slow, my beef and broccoli was ungodly salty, the hot and sour soup lacked character and something in the meal overall I think I was allergic to because I started to profusely sweat and feel ill for 5 mins (my dining companions seemed fine so this was just an aside for people with food allergies). Also the spinach and mushroom dumplings were gross.   The good : the lamb dumplings were delicious, the servers were very nice and charming, tea was always filled and the general tsos chicken was yummy.   My dining companions said they preferred places in spadina like mothers dumplings. I'm just jazzed we have a dumpling place in Yorkville I can go to when feeling lazy. However when I really want greasy Chinese I'll go to new ho king."}
{"text":"The name is Dumpling Queen and the dumplings were very good at all... I ordered dumpling with pork and shrimp. Pretty sure it was just pork dumplings with a single shrimp in each dumpling. I'm actually fine with that, but too bad that the shrimp didn't taste like shrimp at all. In fact, it didn't taste like anything... What's more, when I got in one of the lady was handling dumpling skin and making dumplings bare hand by the front. After taken my order, she took the menu, went back, and resumed her work WITHOUT washing her hands!!! ........ Do I need to say more?"}
{"text":"Three orders of dumplings and they were all superb. Great service and price."}
{"text":"The pan fried lamp dumplings were really great! super juicy and crisp ~ servers were a little slow but very nice. the place is a little small but im here for the food so im not going to complain."}
{"text":"I've probably stepped foot into Dumpling Queen just two times over the 10 years I've lived close by. I wasn't a huge fan of Dumpling Queen but seeing as how they rebranded recently into Meet Dumplings, and as a huge fan of dumplings myself, I thought I'd give it a try again in hopes that a decent dumpling shop has opened by Yorkville. Unfortunately, it's not much of an improvement from Dumpling Queen, but it is still an improvement I suppose.  We ordered two plates of dumplings, one boiled and one pan fried, a plate of yeong chow (or they called it yangzhou, same thing) fried rice, and a bowl of soup. The potions are quite big and it's fairly cheap considering how much food you get. I was pleasantly surprised by their fried rice as it was flavourful, but yeong chow fried rice should have BBQ pork which they didn't have, so the fried rice really wasn't a yeong chow fried rice - more like an egg and shrimp fried rice.  We got a corn soup, which came in a huge bowl but ended up tasting quite bland. It was essentially just a bowl of thickened water with corn. It honestly would've been better if they just got a can of creamed corn from a grocery store and heated it up with some chicken bits.  Now the star of a dumpling restaurant should really be the dumplings, and it was just ok. The boiled dumplings were slightly better than the pan fried dumplings. The skin of the dumpling was a little too thick, so it almost tasted a bit undercooked when pan fried. The pan fried dumplings at the Dumpling House on Spadina are much better. The thickness of the skin also dampened the taste of the filling so you couldn't really get the full taste of the pork and cabbage.   My guess is that any dumpling restaurant will start to have a hard time competing now that many of them have started delivering through third party services so distance is less of an issue. You would have to have a top-notch quality dumpling that out-completes the rest of them in order to survive. Meet Dumplings has the location advantage by being the only dumpling restaurant in the location, but as dumplings make great delivery food items, that advantage is essentially moot.  The restaurant seems to be run by a group of very friendly and hard working people, so I really do hope the best for them. The service was friendly, fast, and attentive and it seems like they are trying hard to stay afloat. Perhaps I shall try again some time in the future to see if any adjustments have been made, but until then, this would not be one that I would recommend unless you have an intense last minute craving for dumplings."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cheap prices and sweet service. The dumplings are filling and very tasty. Their selection is quite variable and it can satisfy the taste buds of any dumpling fan."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday nite. I ordered one serving of dumplings and I waited for 40 minutes for that. I don't know what kind of restaurant in downtown Toronto does that. Like what? I will never ever ever come back here again."}
{"text":"I took the wife here for a quick bite, she is a person that is skeptical to try new things but she sure loved the meat and veg dumplings.   We have come here a few times and order for delivery the food is great and the portions are huge.  The only downside is that the deep fried dumpings tend to be swimming in oil they need to drain them before serving.  Apart from that the service is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best, and service is incredibly slow. You will hear the staff yelling Chinese at each other often, which killed the mood for me.  The second (and last time) I went, I think I saw the staff putting semi-used napkins back in their stockpile. I hope they do not use the same kind of care with food...."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleagues today and we enjoyed pigging out on dumplings and noodles.  I found the food a bit salty but it was edible.  My favourite dumpling was the pork and cabbage dumplings.  Owner was really nice so we will definitely be back for more.  This place is the only dumpling place in the Yonge and Bloor area so definitely no competition for this store yet.  My colleagues liked how the food came out quick and it was pretty affordable.  Can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"We lived right around the corner from this place and ordered from there often. I enjoyed the panfried dumplings; pork and chive was a personal favourite. The boiled dumplings (I think they are boiled). are good too, but maybe if they were steamed they would be better. We ordered a few plates of food once and it was gross. The meat had chunks of something in it (bone? cartilage?).  I get grossed out easily, so perhaps this won't bug everyone. I would just stick with the dumplings dipped in a vinegar and chilli mix."}
{"text":"My go-to place for dumpling. Simple service, & layout, & delish dumplings. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The boiled dumplings were terrific.  We got 15 total which included shrimp/chive, beef, and pork dumplings.  The place could use a minor makeover but if you want good dumplings at a reasonable price Dumpling Queen is it!"}
{"text":"The service is nice and friendly, however the food is really really terrible. Bland and tasteless. Mother's dumpling takes these guys to the cleaners."}
{"text":"Still Bugs Me It has been almost year but every time I pass by it, I still feel sick seeing this restaurant's sign so I decided to write it out here. What happened: new waiter served the wrong dish( which is cheaper than we ordered) to our table, the boss came over and asked if we can just eat it without offering remaking the right dish. We kindly said yes to eating the food that we didn't order.  However, when we checked out, they charged us the more expensive food that we did order but did not get the chance to eat. I did not realize until I got home.  What I suggest you: DO NOTgo there .Don't get fooled by those fake smiles they put up."}
{"text":"I have read the other reviews on this site and have a few qualms.  Firstly, steamed dumplings are Cantonese. Don't complain that they boil their dumplings. It shows me that you don't know the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese style food. Most dumplings from mainland China and Taiwan are done in this style and are either boiled of fried. If you are looking for dim sum style steamed dumplings, go to a Cantonese restaurant.   Secondly, I am not going to be rating them on anything, but their dumplings. Since they are a dumpling house, the rest of their food doesn't concern me and probably wouldn't be stellar Chinese food.   The good news is, their dumplings are good. That is really all there is to say about it. They may not be the most flavourful in the city, but they are solid and well cooked. They have their own style at this place and it is evident.   My only complaint is that I ordered these dumplings and they didn't come with any soy sauce or house vinegar/soy stuff to dip them in.   Otherwise, these are solid dumplings and they hit the spot."}
{"text":"Dumpling Queen is a pretty swanky place. Actually a lot of Chinese people eat here because it tastes authentic and delicious! I like to come here for my dumpling cravings because Chinatown is a tad too far away for me. You can either order steamed dumplings or pan-fried dumplings, kind of like gyoza. Those happen to be my favourite!   I like to get the pork and Chinese cabbage pan-fried dumplings. They come in a set of 12 as opposed to the 15 steamed dumplings, and they cost the same unfortunately. However the dumplings are crispy and chewy, and the filling is nice and juicy. It's a pretty good price- $6.95 for 15 steamed dumplings or 12 pan-fried dumplings, enough to fill you up for one meal.   The place itself is kind of oily and unkempt, but the staff are very friendly! They make the food quickly so that you won't pass out from starvation. It's a family-run restaurant so it's very endearing to watch their children help out. All in all it's a good place for a quick bite, but not a great restaurant to go on a first date."}
{"text":"Oh my god, this place serves delicious food! I had General TSO Chicken and my friend had a selection of four kinds of dumplings. Both was so yummi! And even better: It was super cheap. We paid less then 25 Canadian Dollars for both together, Ice water was of course for free. The size of the meal was so big, that we I ate the leftovers on the next day for lunch and needed nothing else.  The atmosphere is ok... It's authentic Chinese, so not very comfortable. But if you don't care about that and just want tasty food, then you shouldn't have objections to go there."}
{"text":"The waitress tried to argue with me about not leaving tip when the food (I ordered hot sour soup + pan fried dumplings) tasted mediocre and the service were done poor. :( I signaled for one of the waiters that I'm done and is ready for the bill. He just says 'yes' and returns to tending to the table like nothing happened. I then asked him whether he's bringing a machine to me or am I coming up to the counters.. and he just says 'yes' again LOL. I find it funny how the other waitress argued with me about leaving a tip."}
{"text":"Second time visiting Dumpling Queen after raving about it to my wife. What a let down - the \"service\" was non-existent! We waited 15 minutes for anyone to come over and when the server finally did come over she was very impatient, almost as though we were a bother to her for wanting to order food. Anyway we ordered dumplings and drinks, my brother drink and my wife made it to the table in a few minutes, mine took asking her twice for it! Seriously!?  Anyway as always the 2 orders of dumplings we ordered were fantastic! Super moist and soft and juicy and delicious! After finishing those we wanted to order another 2 orders.... After 20 minutes of our server not coming by to do a table check or offer more drinks (wtf), we simply paid the bill and left!  To bad - if it wasn't for the great dumplings I'd never return.  Food 5 stars Service 0 stars"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. They took over 45 minutes to boil dumplings. WTF. would not recommend."}
{"text":"It is no longer dumping queen. Switched ownership, it's now called meet dumpling. Still don't have LLBO license. Don't come, we ordered 3 plates of fried dumnplings and it took 40mins for the first plate to come out and It doesn't even taste good. Skin is too thick and very little fillings. Then 5mins later second plate came out, we finished both plates and the 3rd plate still didn't come out. The store was empty maybe 3-4 other tables taken so I don't know why it takes so long. We ended up cancelling the third plate and just paid our bills, they didn't even apologize or anything. Also service wasn't even good, our tea was empty and never filled. We use to come all the time when it was dumping queen and we loved it, now we are probably never coming back. It's a Shame."}
{"text":"I've always been iffy about dumplings, but this place really helped me figure out that when dumplings are done right, they are amazing!!!  Service was fast and friendly, and I always crave them now! I personally love the pork and shrimp dumplings, and they also have a other items on the menu if you want them and maybe your friend doesn't. I'd like to try the rest of their menu but I'm honestly too hooked on the dumplings."}
{"text":"We ordered the mix of lamb, beef and chicken dumplings.. they all tasted the same. The filling inside the dumplings all looked similar. The taste wasn't exceptionally great, but it was decent.  We ordered a Coors light. When received, there was residue on the opening down to the neck of the bottle. We didn't think they could have served us a leaked bottle.. but they sure did.  In the end, they over charged us. I had calculated in my head that the bill should have been around $20 taxes in. Instead we were billed $22.50. We didn't dispute it.. we paid and left immediately."}
{"text":"People might know \"Meet Dumplings\" as Dumpling Queen. What I thought was a rebrand, I can confidently say that the owner have changed. New menu, new cook, new dumplings, where New does not mean Better for this restaurant.....   My order:  Pork with chive pan fried dumplings- weirdly made dumpling where dumplings peel didn't even wrap the stuffing properly. Taste was average. Decent portion size.   Pork with cabbage boiled dumplings- chewy and soft peel with plain stuffing. Overall super disappointing, shape of the dumplings were ugly too.   The worst part was the Kung pao chicken. Tasted like a collage student's first try at cooking from an unsuccessful recipe. The chicken was not fresh, cucumber and peanuts were not crunchy and sauce was watery.   So to conclude, not worth $36 for a meal."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this place, this me I had a good friend visiting in from New York, we both were in the mood to go for something different, we took a stroll down young street and we found the dumpling Queen, I suggest if you are adventurous and not picky, then get the combination platter it will include seafood dumplings, more traditional style dumplings, both steamed and fried so there something there for every pallet especially if you're sharing, I found the restaurant itself traditional I've eaten at many dumpling place as before, the head chef is the mother and she been putting her love into all those dumplings every day for us to eat, if you're wondering who she is she is the lady in the front window cooking away, I didn't find it though I little hot inside they could use a little bit of better air-conditioning it did feel a little stuffy, but we did come on and extremely hot day, other than that the food is amazing don't miss out"}
{"text":"Picked up my girlfriend from work and the ramen we wanted was closed so decided to eat here as she said none of her co workers willing to eat chinese food with her. The store was small and not fancy so I was expecting much. The service was outstanding and shocking actually because usually at a chinese place I do not expect much from service. The food came pretty quick too and it tasted good as well. I had the trio option for assorted dumplings and my girlfriend had the veggie pot stickers, pretty good and light. We also ordered the hot and sour soup. Kinda spicy but i can take it. But too spicy for some people for sure. Over all would go again for the dumplings and the service. Seems like a happy family run place."}
{"text":"Please do pay attention to your bills!!! They add 15% tip to the total charge without telling you and only show the lump sum amount on the bill.  Dishonest vendor.   Dumplings are all hand-made, taste ok. Don't order the hot & sour soup: the  ingredients are mainly tofu."}
{"text":"Dumplings are good but NEVER try food other than dumplings here....I ordered a Preserved vegetable and shredded pork noodle soup.The pork was so over cooked and I could hardly chewing it..."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to downtown Toronto from the Richmond Hill/Markham area, I've been craving me some hearty Northern Chinese carbs; especially beef noodle soup.  So I was quite excited to see a grandma preparing fresh dough in the window of Dumpling Queen.  My my experiences uptown, usually places that make dumplings also makes their own noodles.  When I got into the restaurant I noticed the distinctive Northern Chinese accents of the servers and chefs (who seemed to be related) so I knew I was in good hands.  OK. So far all signs are pretty promising. Juuuust one little thing: my own dumb assumption. For some reason (maybe it was the cute grandma in the window), I thought that they hand-made all their dough-related dishes (including their noodles).  So I was not to pleased when I got my order that not only were the noodles not hand made but have been over cooked to a level of no return.  They were disintegrating between my chopsticks.  The soup was very soy-saucy and had very minimal beef taste.  I also ordered the family style salad which was pretty tasty but I was too grief stricken over my beef noodle soup to appreciate it.    To be fair this place is called Dumpling Queen and I did not order any dumplings.  I have a feeling that they will be better than the noodles because at least they are handmade from scratch.  I feel bad about writing this review because the people who work here seem to be really nice so maybe I will come back and try their dumplings."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING. First off it took them 2 hours for the delivery, for the amount of food we ordered is ridiculous, it was cold. The food was all terrible. The noodles were partly burnt and crispy mean while the others were soft and DRENCHED in butter or some greasy oil. TASTELESS. Had 0 taste. The General tao was soft, also not very good. I've never had food this disappointing. The proportions were so inconsistent. Im disturbed that this place has the good reviews it has because it does not add up to the service or the food OR the price. we paid 70$!! For the worst Chinese food I think my family and I ever had."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Dumpling Queen. It worked out that I happened to be in the neighborhood for a day-course with a colleague and we needed somewhere to get a quick lunch. We didn't go too crazy, but we ordered the boiled lamb, pan-fried pork and chive, and beef roll. Nothing was BAD, but everything was just very fine. Not fine as in fine wine, fine as in my Monday morning was fine. It was all just a little bland, a little soggy and kind of expensive for what you got. No regrets, I just wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Seems like the kind of place that would give you food poisoning.  Dumplings taste good (far better than Mother's Dumplings), but the dishes are dirty, the floors are dirty, the tables feel dirty, the walls are very dirty. Dirty. Service is blah. Water seemed to have an oily film on the top.  But the food tastes good."}
{"text":"I've tried a few of the dumpling choices here but I always choose to order the pork and chive one because it's the best! I always get the pan fried pork and chive and the boiled pork and chive. Both are definitely worth ordering. It's my favorite place for them, it's the most flavorful and best-tasting.   The dumplings have yummy soup in them and the skin is chewy and delicious :D   I believe the price for one serving is 6.99.   I really wanted to give them a 5-star but it's just there have been 1-2 times when the dumplings were broken. But the staff is really nice and upon pointing it out they just redid it and gave me new ones :)  They also accept all forms of payment. (Except maybe not Amex)"}
{"text":"My 8 friends and I came here for dumplings, and even though we only stopped for dumplings (I was holding a mini food tour), they quickly set-up a table for all of us in the back. We ordered the pork and chive dumplings fried, and the shrimp and vegetable dumplings boiled (apparently they don't steam them). I expected to hate the boiled dumplings but we actually really enjoyed them. Some people even said that they preferred them over the fried dumplings. That's a first for me! The service was great, and we received our food quickly. I plan to return and try some of their other menu options. They have quite a large menu, and the Schezuan section appealed to several people in my group."}
{"text":"Tried it out after I found out about it. I went over, gave my ordered and waited around for it. Dumplings were not comparable to Mother Dumplings or Dumpling King and they were more expensive. While the atmosphere was decent and so was the staff, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I went two weeks ago. I was a regular customer, won't be after this past experience.  I ordered, and waited 25 minutes for my order, the customer service was horrendous, when I asked why my order was delayed, they said it'll be ready soon, I said other people's food have arrived before mine, and their response, \"well, they ordered before you\". While yes, the other people arrived earlier, they added to their order and that was after me.   This wasn't the first time this happened, it happened in January as well - they apologized and offered me a free plate of dumplings - which I did not take up their offer, given it's a family business and I feel bad.  This place was also not clean, one time I came and sat down, and saw a mini cockroach crawl on their wall - they moved me to another table and said it's a small bug. I know the difference between a small bug and cockroach."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cheap and yummy.   It looks small from the outside but it is an ok sized place inside. I have been here  3 times and tried the dumplings and the wonton soup and it was very good."}
{"text":"I popped in here with a friend for a quick bite before a show. We ordered spring rolls which were meh, the pancake which had the smell of rancid oil but still managed somehow to taste okay, and the pork and chive dumplings which were actually flavourful and good. The service was decent and the food came out fast. I won't be back, but it wasn't the worst thing I have eaten."}
{"text":"Since I was here last, Dumpling Queen has been renamed (and possibly taken over) by  \"Meet Dumplings\". I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a pun on the kind of fillings they offer but if not the joke's certainly on me.   Emboldened by the new name  and a broader menu, and hoping for a better experience than last time, I popped in for lunch.   What followed was weird from a culinary and social perspective.   One of my biggest criticisms of the erstwhile Dumpling Queen was the servers' challenges with orders placed in English. I can report that this has not changed, but as before a point here and there on the menu, and I was able to confirm my order of Moo Shu pork over steamed rice.   I love Moo Shu pork. I understand that the version we tend to receive s about as authentically Chinese as I am (which is to say, not), but there's something about crispy pork bits mixed with scrambled eggs and black mushrooms and julienned veg (cabbage or otherwise) that just registers as comfort food.   That's not what I got.   Maybe the version I received is truer to the original. Fat slabs of undercooked pork belly, globs of crusty egg, floppy cucumbers in a clear 'sauce' that made me question my manhood. I sincerely don't want to offend, but it was gross.   Weirder, the soundtrack to my sad little lunch.   At the next table over, loudly, two undergraduate dudes who from what I could glean had previously enjoyed an undefined relationship somewhere between friends with benefits and full partnership were discussing their current relationships...one in very colourful detail, which led the other to offer a series of cutting, passive-aggressive responses while rage-poking at his dumplings. Eventually, he grew so tired of his dining companion's comments that he flat-out asked why the dude had invited him to lunch and pointed out that the conversation was just cruel. I would have wondered the same thing and saluted him for standing up for himself, but I was already out the door-cucumbers congealing on my plate.   So, this was a learning experience if nothing else:   1) Beware of Moo Shu offered by strange restaurants. 2) A new name and a coat of paint don't make up for a fundamentally unpleasant dining experience.  3) Don't hang out with your exes.  4) Every day I'm happier that I got married.  5) When it comes to meet Dumplings, sweep left."}
{"text":"When I'm craving for dumplings during work hours, I will go to Dumpling Queen. It's cheap ($6.95-$7.95 for either 15 boiled or 12 pan fried dumplings) and tasty. Portion is generous. I especially like their egg plant, minced pork rice ($10.95) - it also comes with either egg drop soup or hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad. I ordered the pork and chives pan-fried dumplings, and the shrimp/veggie boiled dumplings. Both tasted fresh with the fillings, but nothing exceptional. Also got the green onion fried pancake, but very unimpressed...it was just fried dough with a shortage of green onions.   Prices are good for what you get, and overall seems like a comfy place to get your dumpling fix."}
{"text":"Delicious Shanghai noodle and dumplings. The fried rice could use little more ingredients though. It's looks like a family run business so service can be little slow at peak hrs. We were served lukewarm tea at first but they refilled with hot tea later on."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious fresh dumplings! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've always eaten take out from this place, so I'm not too sure about the service or experience of eating in in this place. However, every time I come for take out during lunch hours, it's packed and has a small lineup.   I've only really tried two different types of food here, their dumplings and their stir fried noodles. As their name suggested, only go for their dumplings. Anything else, you'll probably end up with a disappointment.  If you've eaten a lot of Chinese food, you'll notice that they like to use a lot of oil to cook. In this place, you'll feel like they took it to a whole 'nother level. Their pan fried dumplings will feel like they were deep fried, or at least the bottom of it. Luckily, they didn't soak up the oil, so the pan fried dumpling always comes with a nice texture of crispiness on the bottom, but with a nice soft skin on the top, and mouth watering juice in the meat. However, if you get their stir fried noodles, oh man..... every bite feels like the noodles were dipped in oil before eating them. It was oily, and salty, and nothing special to it.  So like I said, and as their name suggested, just go for their dumplings."}
{"text":"Stuff your face with pan fried goodness while dipping in vinegar and soy sauce you can not go wrong with trying these favourites at such great prices. We had the combo dumpling, pork and chive pan fried dumplings and by special request, shrimp soup dumplings. I came hungry and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Got the boiled lamb dumplings. Soggy and overcooked. The filling was okay, but tasted too much like msg. Didn't feel like eating more than one.   Friendly mom and pop place with quick service, but the food was pretty terrible. Will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the food.  The dumplings are delicious. I would stick to the traditional pork dumplings, maybe with some shrimp. They are delicious. They are the perfect size and ratio. These dumplings are hands down the most authentic that I have had in canada. They remind me of my father-in-law's dumplings he makes when we visit him in Beijing.  They also have Lao Beijing noodles which are a classic in Beijing, something that's really hard to find in canada. Usually they give you a south chinese equivalent or, the sauce isn't preserved enough. Other than that, I would stick to those two options.   It's a family run place and they are usually there before/after hours. One time, they even opened the resto half an hour early for us! That's better service than I've had in most restaurant in Toronto.  Also, you get great bang for your buck. We usually buy a few dozen bags of frozen dumplings on our way out to cook up on a busy night.   Really nice. Really accommodating. And delicious authentic dumplings."}
{"text":"Service: Its a one man show here. There was only one server, and I swear probably one chef. This was during the lunch rush too. Took forever taking our orders, and took even longer making our dishes. They even missed one of our dishes.  Ambiance: I didn't expect much from the decor, but I the place doesn't look too sanitized.  Food: It was unfortunately that my friend and I didn't get to try their dumplings, as the place is called \"Dumpling Queen\". This was the dish they missed on our order. The other dishes that actually came were really bland and oily."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch a couple of days ago after my girlfriend told me that they've opened shop. It seems to be run by a very nice asian family, and I am all for supporting family businesses, so I said why not!  I ordered their fried chicken dumplings, and my friend got the fried spinach & mushroom. The service was okay, seeing as they didn't really have any other customers to service other than us. The dumplings themselves were not bad, although a bit too salty for my tastebuds. Out of the two different ones that we got, I liked my chicken better, as the spinach & mushroom didn't taste too much of anything really, just spices and salt...  I definitely will be back though, to try out the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"They have great dumplings and prices, plus fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"Came here late night with a friend of mine and we really enjoyed it. Tasty dumplings that ooze goodness!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food. Lovely little unassuming spot to grab excellent dumplings, a good variety of other Chinese dishes. Everything was hot, fresh, quick with smiling service. This will be a regular stop for us from now on."}
