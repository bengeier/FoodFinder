{"text":"If I'm feeling boring (which I do feel quite often), I drag boyfriend here to go eat.

The story goes something like a woman couldn't keep the noodles hot for her husband so she thought genius idea separate the stuff from the soup and it'll stay hot.

So, we order the crossbridge noodle and they bring out a plate of veggies and a plate of meat. I always ask for my veggies (minus the parsley) to be added in boyfriend's bowl. Then they bring out the boiling soup and add in all the stuff. Ta da!

We also order the pork slices with special sauce. Not too spicy (if it was really that spicy I wouldn't eat it) and very yummy.

Go try it!

**pretty sure it's cash only but don't quote me!"}
{"text":"The food is authentic and amazing. It tastes like a home cooked meal! Must tries are the cold pork belly (it sounds weird but it is THE BEST dish), the pancake and the Yunnan Crossbridge Noodle. The soup is so tasty but clear and simple all at once! Be sure to read the story behind the Crossbridge Noodle. The owner is really friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This place is nostalgia for me, coming here since I was at the tender age of 6. However I've only tried maybe 6 items on the menu! Albeit their menu is small. Overall the portions do seem to have gone down significantly since I was younger but considering more dishes are 5-7 doars with the signature at 5.50... What do you expect! 

Their signature is the cross bridge noodles. I've read the story maybe 70 times, and its nice. Dish itself is solid, their noodles are really good. Soup is amazing but some chilli oil is even better. Vegetables are fresh, however, meat choices are odd. It comes with \"normal\" meats such as cha siu, chicken and pork but also ham and roast beef?!

Spicy eggplant is the best eggplant dish I've ever had, period. It's only 5.99 and for the price of a drink at some places you get a plate of crisp yet soft eggplant in a bomb chilli sauce.

Their stewed pork with preserved veg is amazingly not heavy at all considering the use of belly and flavors are always good. Also huge portion for 6.99 price.

Corn pancake is 2.99 and I usually order two because they cannot be beat!

The staff is extremely kind to everyone, its a small family run business! We've been coming in for maybe 10 years so we're friends! Owner's little girl is often there and she is super well behaved!"}
{"text":"Very authentic cross bridge noodle, simple yet hearty.  Delicious yet spicy cold seaweed app, salt and pepper fried pork filets, finish the meal w/ the corn pancake."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. I love the story behind their \"Cross Bridge Soup\" - it's posted on the wall of the restaurant. The soup is amazing - tastes great + a great experience. 

This is NOT the place you go for the ambiance - just great food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"What's Yunnan Cross Bridge Rice Noodle?  Why don't I let the experts tell you instead of me making this into a 30 page essay assignment?  If you like some HISTORY or CULTURE behind your food then take a look.

On to the restaurant, it is situated inside a small plaza that had it's time in the hay-days but NO longer in it's prime.  This restaurant had guest coming in and out filling nearly half the space but don't come expecting fabulous decor or service(Mandarin-speaking mostly).  

The patrons that did fill this place ordered ONE thing and one thing only which was the Cross Bridge Rice Noodle, out of a menu of approximately 50 items.  There were Cold Appetizers, NOODLES, Mains, Soups & Rice, Desserts.

The Cross Bridge Rice Noodle came out in UNDER one minute and has a very well-balanced Chicken Broth with the additions of Quail Egg, Ham Slice, Roast Beef Slice, Sprouts, Chicken Slice, etc...

The noodle is a Rice Noodle that resembles Spaghetti in shape and size but White in color and SLIPPERY in texture.  This type of Rice Noodle are one of my all time favourites growing up in Hong Kong and still continues to be UNIQUE for me.

Aside from the History & Culture of this dish, the combination itself is nothing FANCY but that won't stop you from ENJOYING it like how most people love PHO.  The same that makes PHO popular can be said the same for the Cross Bridge Noodle, the BROTH is star.

There are not MANY places in Toronto with the same dish available unfortunately, so not having been to Yunnan myself I would say this restaurant with THIS dish is A-OK."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on weekend.  Very quiet - only 4 tables of customers.  
Spicy intestine rice noodle was not too spicy but very tasty.  Great value for $7.  Also had preserved veg with minced pork rice noodle.  Lots of veggies and cilantro.  Again - great value for $7. 
We also ordered 2 dishes - double cooked pork.  Bamboo shoot with minced pork.  At $8 and $7 - very fair portion.  
Did not see any dish greater than $10.  Would definitely return again.   Tasty home cooked food at low low prices."}
{"text":"This hidden little gem is located inside a very plain plaza. I ordered the cross bridge noodle which consisted bits and pieces of everything. Two slices or thin pork, two thin pieces of ham, one pieces of salami, beef ball, and tofu fish, quail egg, little pieces of pickled vegetables, peanuts, bean curd, some lettuce, and one piece of chicken. The broth it self isnt over flavoured, it has a nice clear taste. I was sick that day I had this so I thought thr broth was amazing for my condition that day. This noodle is $6.99 and it came out hot and I thought portions were good.  We also got the spicy lamb noodle and it was also amazing, quite spicy but extremely flavourful, kinda sour and kinda spicy for $8.50. Portions were also good. I would def come back and try out other things. Service was efficient and server was nice."}
{"text":"its been a while since we came here
but as usual, we ordered the Cross Bridge Rice Noodle & corn pancakes to share

the Cross Bridge Rice Noodle comes w/ a plate of raw meat (ham, roast beef, chicken, quail egg) & a plate of veggies
everything then goes into a broth
tastes okay; like light chicken soup

the corn pancakes were nice, but could use less oil. I have yet to find another place that makes this dish"}
{"text":"My parents lived in Yunnan for 10 years and this is definitely NOT authentic. That normally wouldn't bother me as long as the food still tastes good. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. We tried a variety of noodle soups and none were great. All of the soup bases were bland. We had to put a ton of salt in even tho we typically eat quite light. 

Worst part is, the woman in charge (manager?) had an awful attitude and no concept of service :/ it was a sub par meal to say the least."}
{"text":"I don't know about other items on the menu but the ox tail noodle I had was really good. The ox tail is super tender and the meat can be easily pulled off from the bone. The soup itself is not too salty. And it's not too busy there (not sure if it's a good thing) but I didn't have to wait and food came fast."}
{"text":"Sadly, inauthentic. My family are Yunnan natives and we came here hoping to try a taste of home here in Canada and were utterly disappointed. We ordered the ?????? (Yunnan Cross Bridge Noodles) and the ????? (Yunnan Fried Rice Cake). The flavours were totally bland, the rice noodles (??) were overcooked, and the soup was lukewarm. Even worse, the noodle soup had run-of-the-mill store-bought meats and ham in it! It was no different than some cheap homemade Hong Kong instant noodles with processed ham and lettuce. 

Authentic ???? is made with piping hot soup, often spicy and very flavourful, which cooks through the fresh thinly sliced meats and vegetables put in it. This is similar to Japanese ramen or Vietnamese pho in some ways. We had to dump tablespoons of hot sauce into our meal to make it palatable. 

The supposed Yunnan style fried rice cake was not made authentically at all - they used Shanghai style rice cake (?? instead of ???and the seasoning, again, was bland and far from authentic. Real Yunnan fried rice cake is much spicier, and uses spicy smoked sausage. This was a thorough disappointment!

Real Yunnan people and Yunnan food lovers, beware!"}
{"text":"Yunnan Cross Bridge Rice Noodle is a fun place to eat especially when your friend trying to share a folklore with you while you go yay yay yay with noodles and corn pancakes stuck full in your mouth.

The soup based is really light chicken broth, just have a hint of favour. I restained myself from adding any hot chilli oil in order to taste the dish the way it is. The meat that comes with it does not make me feel too excited though.... I can just skip that.

The corn pancake ($1.99) is nice for dessert. I just like corn and pancakes so a winning combination for me.. and of course for $1.99 I am happy!

Cash Only!"}
