{"text":"Too, too, too, too expensive.  You can do waaaaay better for the ridiculous price of $27.00 pp.  Really, go somewhere else.  The food is just adequate."}
{"text":"Good variety of food. A little pricy.  Love the taro."}
{"text":"Surprisingly packed on Saturday night (They're pretty empty otherwise on weeknights).   With only two waiters rushing around the whole place, I'm actually really impressed with the level of service.  1. Drinks and condiments were provided promptly after we were seated 2. Since the place is small, the waiter was able to constantly check up on us.  3. Orders arrived fairly quick   So, what makes me return to a hot pot restaurant?  The menu items and the quality of their beef. Sadly, the beef here isn't the best (even for AYCE). It's visibly frozen, and tough to chew on when cooked. I don't order anything but beef, so I can't speak for how good the pork or chicken is.   I ended up eating a lot of tofu, spam, gluten and watercress.   There aren't many hot pot places in North York so this place is worth a try before commuting up to Markham/Richmond Hill.   Tip: 1. 10% Gratuity included in the bill 2. $2.00 more on weekends  3. They have pork bone soup base!"}
{"text":"Youre better off going somewhere else. You have to pay extra for the freaking broth! The service is also horrible - whenever we asked for more food (AYCE), they tell us \"are you going to finish all of this?\" I get it, you dont want to waste food but we would not order unless we couldnt finish it. They made us feel as if they were doing US a favour by eating at their restaurant. Dont like the atmosphere either."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food quality is also terrible for how much you pay. My friends and I decided to try this place as we were nearby and the reviews (at that time) was 4 stars. I can't believe people are giving this place 4-5 stars. There's a reason why no one's here on a Saturday dinner time. The quality of their meat are what you would expect from a cheap hot pot place.   They have 10% cash discount, but the whole table has to pay in cash. Even if you do split bills, if one person is paying with card then no one gets the discount.  Also, be aware of the bill. They include tip in the bill (even for 2 people table..) but won't tell you."}
{"text":"During the winter, I basically crave hotpot all the time. I was super excited when Hot Pot on Yonge opened because it's within walking distance of home.  Atmosphere: Maybe it's due to how cold Toronto's been this year, but they are always busy. Hotpot does involve open pots of boiling water so the restaurant has a tendency to steam up. Your clothes and hair will smell like hotpot after. There are large tables to accommodate bigger groups and they take reservations. I usually speak Mandarin to the servers as I find it's easier to communicate.   Service: Each time I've been it's super hectic and the servers always seems overworked. Everything manages to get to the table quickly though and the correct order.  Food: The selection is pretty standard, a lot of fish balls, vegetables, lamb, beef slices and a seafood option that includes 1/2 lobster. The serving size of each order is reasonable and you don't have to worry about ordering too much at a time or not enough. The menu is AYCE and comes in Chinese and English. All in all, it's a good hotpot restaurant and is on par with the ones uptown."}
{"text":"For once I encounter a hotpot place that has great customer service! A young woman served us (assume she's owner/family) and constantly kept checking up on us during the late hours of the weeknight.   The beef was really good - along with the dipping sauces. I don't have hot pot a lot but I won't be going to Richmond hill now to have hot pot.  Would come again!"}
{"text":"The price point of this restaurant is what attracted me to visit. At $23.99 a person for a week night for AYCE hot pot, this was a major incentive to binge considering most other hot pot restaurants start at $30 and up.   We picked the vegetable broth and preserved egg broth. The basic broths were just that, basic and bland. The vegetable broth was a touch better and had some tomato flavour which lent the broth some depth. After adding more veggies and meat into the broth, the broth actually became quite tasty and I ended up downing it toward the end of the meal.   The selection of veggies and meats were less than other hot pot restaurants , although they did have beef tendon which I have rarely seen elsewhere. Their fried dough fritters stuffed with fish cake were also quite good.   Another plus was that there was unlimited plum juice, and the waiter/owner was very diligent in filling out glasses as soon as they were half empty. Overall the service was on point; the waiter was polite and pleasant throughout our meal.  However a concern of mine was the type of  hot pot stove they use, which I have heard can emit radiation...   In general I would say this is a decent hot pot place if you are craving it."}
{"text":"This place just opened and I decided to check it out.  Being a big fan of chinese hotpot, I usually have to go up to Markham or Richmond Hill to get my fix so I was undoubtedly happy to see this place open up.  Upon entering I was glad to not only see a clean and modern looking interior, but also that it was full of patrons.  The food itself was pretty good; the ingredients were fresh and they weren't stingy with them either.  The service, while a bit understaffed when we went, was quite courteous and helpful, better than most hotpot places I have been to.  The selection is pretty standard, but the prices were fair.  All in all, I hope this place makes it because I would definitely enjoy not having to drive up north for hotpot anymore."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night, one server (which could be the owner as well) made it not attentive enough. Saw twice that as some eating utensils were put back into the clean pile after they were dropped accidentally onto the ground as she was preparing for the new tables...   We went in 9ish, and at around 10:50pm she came to use and said that it was last call. So we rushed in our final orders after a new friend came to join us half an hour ago. Then at 11pm, we witnessed another couple walked in and she would sit them down and whispered to them that they had an hour of eating time. (Meanwhile, she told us it was last call just 10 minutes before then).   Before we can ask her why she would told different customers different info, 3 other groups of people came in, and she sat them all down to serve them.....  Quality of foods was barely ok, some veggies we ordered were a bit rotten and dry. Seemed like those bulk order off the specially discounted foods rack....    Given the above, we will be happy to rate it no stars vs one star."}
{"text":"I came here with my cousin for some winter hot pot action last night.  The first thing I noticed was how quick the service was, which is great. Especially since we ordered two rounds and needed that second round in, cooked and eaten before my stomach knew what was happening.   The food itself was not bad, but not the best I've had. I liked their variety of vegetables and the fact that the servings were appropriate considering how many people we were. I've been to a couple of other places where they give you a giant order, no matter who's there. Then you end up eating a pound of beef, when I'd rather have just a small portion of many of things.   I agree with Karl, the lamb was the best item we had. The hot chilli soup was deliciously spicy and flavourful, though I was missing the Szechuan peppercorns.  The place filled up by about 7pm, so be there early.   Being that it seems to be the only Chinese hot pot restaurant in North York, I'm happy that it's decent. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Went here for hot pot with a group of friends back in December - exactly what I needed, and what I expected for a -15C day with wind chill. Even on a weekend night, got a table for 6 right away and was able to place order for soup bases before my friends got here so it would arrive at the same time as they would. They didn't hold back on portions (we got a -lot- of food) and everything went perfectly smooth. Waiters understand both Cantonese and Mandarin (which is great because my Mandarin is non-existent) and usually responsive. Pricing is competitive to a lot of other hot pot places uptown and midtown - only disadvantage is that it'll be packed by 7, so make sure you go early!"}
{"text":"What I loved about the staff here was that they were all extremely efficient and fast with all of our orders and requests.  Once we needed something and asked, the staff would literally get it to us right away.  It was so impressive (and rare) to see such efficient service that was attentive and caring.  I loved it!  They also cleared empty dishes off of our table almost immediately when they saw that we were done with the plate.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is an AYCE at a price of 27 bucks a head. In comparison to Morals Village, I'd say the broth at Morals is much more flavorful...however! Hot Pot on Yonge gives you more generous portions of meat and the service is a lot more attentive. But to be fair it was a Wednesday night and they were not really busy at all (only 2 other tables) I have read previous reviews that this place has good service regardless.  I tried the satay broth which is spicy but not too much, and we also got the clear broth. I highly recommend ordering the pork kidneys. I love this part of the pig. When cooked right, it has a slight bitter taste but really..hm I'm not sure how to explain it. It might be one of those hate it or love it kind of things. It's just got a really nice interesting texture.  At Morals. they give you slivers. Here, they give you a big generous slice of it. Same with the tripe, bigger pieces are given.  I would give this place 4 stars based on portion sizes and service. I would have liked the broth to have more taste, but guess you can't have everything? I would still call this place a decent hot pot joint, recommend to anyone in the Willowdale area looking for some hot pot."}
{"text":"+Good service and food comes quick. +They serve chrysanthemum drink instead of the plum drink that other places serve -they get you hooked on it and you'll have to pay if you want more.   +free WiFi - 4 people per pot  - not enough strong fans. Felt like we were steaming our faces at a spa"}
{"text":"The food is just so so. But that cup of tea which is free is good. The service is not that good."}
{"text":"Do not come unless you want to be SCAMMED.  Came here on a Saturday night. It was empty. Food was meh but service is just horrible.  When the bill came, the waiter passed us the machine without giving us the receipt. We paid and later realize a 10% charge is already included in the bill. When we ask why didn't you let us know, he just shrugged his shoulder and walked away.  You get 10% off when you pay cash. My friends and I were splitting bills. One would think the bill with cash will get 10% off and the other with credit card wouldn't no. NOPE. I guess logic is not applicable in this restaurant.  HORRIBLE. Do not come."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a hotpot place to go to and I have found the one! The $26.99 for adults is all you can eat. Includes some seafood like mussels and squid. Also, all you can eat enoki mushroom! I find that restaurants are generally cheap when it comes to enoki mushroom. Food is fresh. Meat isn't frozen.They also give you this deep fried dough fritter stuffed with shrimp paste as appetizer.. yum! The tom yum soup has coconut milk in it, which I am not a big fan of and if you're the same, you can ask for it without coconut milk and they will do it for you. There's a variety of food and also a variety of ingredients to make your sauce.  The place is clean. The place is a bit small so I can imagine that there is a wait time during prime hours. I felt a little rushed when I was seated and I was waiting for my friends to arrive before ordering."}
{"text":"It's about $25 per person with tax and the automatic 10% gratuity. But there's lots of variety on the menu and the lamb is superb. Service is good. Despite the odd sound of \"chinese herb jello\" you should actually try it. The only thing I found was the menu is a bit confusing."}
{"text":"HotPot on Yonge is a delicious place to escape to after a long day of doing nothing (Saturday). I'm a huge fan of their soups, the serving sizes are large enough to fill you up, but small enough to not leave you feeling bloated.   It's a super laid back place, and these guys have their process flow down to a science! The friends that brought me here told me to get the lamb with a soup appetizer. I'm not the most educated on spices, but whatever they put in their lamb is hella good! To top it off, the food is very reasonably priced. How can anyone say no to succulent lamb with a soul-ful soup for under $15??  The only reason this place doesn't get a full 5-star is that it's a little cramped. Getting a large group of people in here is troublesome.   TL;DR: Great food, fantastic service. Not really for super big groups ..a little cramped."}
{"text":"Four of us decided to try this place out. It's small compared to those in Richmond Hill/Markham, but if you're able to get a table it's pretty good. The service is very fast. The broths are yummy. We had the spicy chilli chicken - it's loaded with spices and chicken and very spicy. We enjoyed it. They take away the plates just as fast as they bring them to you so it's a good trade off. I'd recommend this place to others but defiantly make a reservation, it fill up quickly."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  I've always walked by this place but never had the chance to try it until recently.  This is a good place for hot pot in the neighbourhood. The service is quick and attentive. As other reviewers had mentioned, they have a system going on, so even though it gets crazy busy in there, everyone gets served in a timely manner.  It's a very casual restaurant, bright, with lots of steam from the pots, so it gets very hot when you're eating in there.  The selection is abundant. Lots of veggies, meat, starch. There are a few seafood dishes you can order, but not too much if you're looking for primarily seafood.  The broth options are good. You can pay extra for special broth, but we just stuck with the clear broth and satay which were both free. I would recommend getting two different broths to try different flavours. They also top up the broth every so often when they notice that you're running low. Mm..I love having a bowl of noodles in hot pot broth!  Since it was just the two of us, we didn't have to order twice. We ordered the lamb, beef, taro, udon noodles, napa cabbage, shrimp (with shell), tofu, and some other stuff. You can also order sauces from a list to go with your meal. The thin slices of meat and soft tofu were so delicious. They also serve you some sort of iced tea and my cup was always filled!    It was definitely very filling and satisfying if you enjoy hotpot.  It was $28.99 each on a weekend. Oh, and if you pay in cash, you get 10% off. They also charge you a 10% service fee, which I assumed was in lieu of gratuity.  All in all, great place for hotpot. I would definitely come here again when I'm feeling something warm in the winter."}
{"text":"Their tom yum broth is amazing. Service is super quick and friendly. The menu is incredibly diverse as well! Love this place."}
{"text":"Decent hot pot at Yonge and finch. We got the clear broth and satay broth which were both delicious. Service is good but they didn't bring out some of the items we ordered. They also put 10% tip into the bill so my friend accidentally tipped an additional 10%. Overall pretty good"}
{"text":"It's okay.. nothing special.. I'm not a big fan of the hot pot.. it was just nice trying it.. only thing is on the bill it came $59 for 2 people. And when I asked how come it's too much. They said that they add the tip to it.. so be careful because they will try to take double tips..."}
{"text":"We want something hot and spicy for a rainy day so we choose this one. The place is small but looks cozy and has nice decor. We pick satay and tom yum goong broth (plus 3.5$) and try 2 types of dipping sauce (0.99$ each). They give us free dough fritter with seafood paste (i guess it's shrimp) which tastes amazing. The cold lemon tea is also free. The staff here is surprisingly efficient, attentive and friendly although she looks a bit tired and never smiles. Meat is fresh and comes out with generous portion, we also try some pork skin with funny texture, pork kidney (tastes good within no more than 2 minutes cooking). Dough fritter is the star here, i can't find it in Celebrity hotpot in downtown.   This place is quite pricey but it worths our money: flavorful broth, fresh meat, free drink and dessert, great service. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yay, review #50!  With my recent lack of hotpot visits recently, my girlfriend and I decided to try Hot Pot on Yonge - though this review is fairly late, since we went multiple months ago.  They function in the same way many other All You Can Eat (AYCE) places do: you write down on the piece of paper what you want and they bring you your food.  They also have regular order-type food, but we didn't have that.  Most of the food we had tasted fresh and, with the strange assortment of food I usually eat at hotpot, this place was pretty good.  I had the pork bone base and the pork bone meat itself was actually really good.  Holy geez, I've never seen a pair of waitresses work as hard as the two that we had.  They were constantly moving around making sure people were happy, refilling pots / water, cleaning... you name it.  The restaurant was in very good condition, likely in part because of those two.  They always brought food when we ordered it and were pretty quick in doing so.  The service was easily the best part about this place.  The place is a little small and was starting to fill up when we were leaving so going early / making a reservation might be an idea here.  I believe if you pay cash, you save 10%, even if the place is a little more expensive than i would have liked (I think it was roughly $27)."}
{"text":"An all you can eat hotpot place.  Quality of the food is good.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Decent amount of food choices.  Some surprising positives, they give you cold lemon tea with your meal which hits the spot for this kind of meal.  They also include a bit of dessert with your meal which is a nice touch. It was not crowded for a Saturday but I think I know why.  It is a bit on the pricy side.  After the meal it was about almost $40 per person.  The price of being on Yonge.  We were not rushed and service was on the better end of things.    10% off if you pay cash."}
{"text":"Nice small place. Service is good. The menu is good. Full menu as a big hot pot place. The menu has all the main things you get with hot pot. Worth it. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Loved the hot pot, great service, value for money, meat was good quality."}
{"text":"Really clean and nice decor. Does both soup noodles and hotpot. Meat, vege and others are the freshest i've had compare to Made in China and Mongolian hotpot. Only 1 waitress but she is really quick, we barely had to wait for anything. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were famished on this cold rainy Sunday morning. In search of a fast solution while walking along Yonge St, we came across a hot pot restaurant displaying: \"ALL YOU CAN EAT.\" It's not weird to have hot pot at lunch at all. Hot Pot not only fills you, but it also warms you... so why not. We were the only ones eating in the store though...   I quickly got to ordering all the condiments that they would bring to your table so that you could make your own sauce mix. We got a dual pot and followed it with a whole ton of meat platters.   Service was great and the food was satisfying. The broth wasn't as flavorful as Mongolian Hot Pot but I'll enjoy unlimited lamb slices any day."}
{"text":"Hot pot is a great option, especially on a cold night. Hot Pot on Yonge is a great choice, with fast service and good portions. However, it's a bit on the pricy end."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out as we were looking for hot pot locations on yonge. The food was surprisingly very good and probably one of the best hot pots I've had. Specifically the meat seems to be very high quality. The price is alittle high at 26.99 for adults but I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"AYCE! Great service, selection and price. The spicy satay broth is just the right amount of heat and they let you get creative by bringing you as much sauce as you need to create your own.   We went as a large group (made a reservation) and they were able to accommodate us easily. I liked the food and experience more than the little sheep."}
{"text":"Place was empty when we came in for a very early dinner. Our hotel was nearby in this primarily Asian hood. It's not a neighborhood I would seek out but if staying at a hotel nearby this was a great meal. Note for reference they do not serve alcohol but plum juice comes standard.   We sat at a table and there's a boiler plate in the center for the pots. They recommended the \"all you can eat\" pot. It comes with a menu and you receive little pencils & a piece of paper to mark off which meats you'd like and a separate order sheet for sauces.  There was a language barrier but their system with the meats & vegetables translated really negates any issue.   We highly recommend the all you can eat pots.  - pick your broth (2) be sure to pick the flavors included in the \"all you can eat\" if that's your plan - pick your meat, vegetables, seafood & noodles  - pick your sauces   We had the following sauces, all authentic and delicious: garlic, red bean curd, oyster, sesame oil, flowering garlic chives (very pungent), & chili paste.  They'll refill at your request.   One large bowl, divided down the center with a divider for two broth options. We ordered preserved  egg & parsley broth for the seafood base and pork bone broth for the base of the meats we ordered. The broths themselves were loaded with flavor but not overly salty.   We ordered shrimp, mussels (only 2 large are served & are frozen), Chinese parsley, watercress and fish balls. We also had the black fungi, so good. My husband are the century egg that came with the broth. Loved it.   For the meat we used the pork bone broth and ordered, beef, pork, fungi, egg, broccoli, Napa cabbage, and black fungi. The meat is sliced impeccably thin so it cooks quickly. It's very fresh unlike the seafood which is all previously frozen.   After I finished my husband ordered the tripe. I'm not a fan but he was happy and the serving was substantial. He also had the Odon noodles which was a small serving but he enjoyed them.   We really enjoyed this place. My husband could not stop reminiscing about his childhood meals. He said it tasted like his grandmothers cooking, quite the compliment.  The restaurant is quiet and in a college area of town but would definitely feed a hungry crew.  They also include an herbal jello or mango pudding at the end for the dessert.   Again, I wouldn't seek it out if you were staying downtown because it's a trek but if you're in this neck of the woods, it's a very authentic and substantial meal."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, I recommend the tom yum broth! It was flavorful not too spicy. All the meat came out promptly and the staff was easy to talk to and very attentive.   The restaurant was clean and very nice. The only complaint is that some of our food was not brought out, this may be due to the Chinese on the fill out sheet not corresponding with the menu or a mistake on our parts but the staff were very friendly to quickly bring us anything they or we missed out on.   The price was a bit high, costing around $61 for two adults, but on a Sunday the restaurant is practically empty and I expected to pay that much for an all you can eat place. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants hot pot and doesn't want to trek all the way to Markham. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"It is a complete rip-off and food is very mediocre. My friend and I went there one night, we didn't order anything with extra charge, and if ends up $70 workout tips! That's crazy. Too many hidden costs, please be aware."}
