{"text":"Great food, great prices.  Friendly people.  They are remodeling (looks great inside) and now have poetry on Thursday nights and play music on Sunday afternoons.  Might be the best food for the price in Charlotte.  Check it out."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time here. Our waiter was nice and the service was quick. It was also kid friendly even though reggae music was playing in the background. It was also a really good place to go for Jamaican food and being a Jamaican family we really enjoyed it. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Jamaican food."}
{"text":"My sister and I took our vacation to Jamaica a couple weeks ago, and we've been dying for some jerk food since we got back. We found this place because someone we met in Montego Bay actually recommended it, so our expectations were high....but they were met! Had the jerked pork with Mac and cheese and it was great. Service was also good, Patricia was super nice as well as the owner. Only thing missing was the festival. Will definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"I had brown chicken with gravy. I enjoyed the taste because it was salty and not too salty. Also, the Mac and cheese complimented the chicken well.   The food was delivered fast and I would definitely come back again to try the other foods that I have not tried."}
{"text":"Had the red snapper with sweet potatoes and plantains - the snapper was ON POINT!  Decent size servings, good food, friendly service, YUP, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place used to be good, however I did not get good service or good food this time.  Bad thing is I talked this place up to my girlfriend and it was her first time, and my last time!  I have not been there in over a year so maybe they changed cooks.  The ox tails where awful the cabbage hard and the plantains where mushy.  The waitress didn't even bring us water to swallow down that' nasty food.  My girlfriend didn't even touch her jerk chicken or macaroni and cheese..  There was a restaurant full of people and only one waitress, who clearly was trying her best, but it was a lot for her to handle alone..Then we had to pay 15.00 each for that dreadful food. Never again.  Be aware"}
{"text":"Food is great....WHEN they have, that is. Came on a Saturday around lunchtime and they did not have any sides except the collard greens (which is not exactly a Caribbean dish). On another occasion, placed a phone order for 2 dinners and arrived 20 minutes later only to be told they never prepared it and I would have to wait another 15 minutes (forget that they tell you it will take 15 minutes when you call in the order).   Right now I've been standing waiting for 5 minutes on the order I called in 25 minutes ago which I was told at the time would be ready in 15 minutes. There are 2 other patrons in the restaurant and 2 people working the counter/serving. So it isn't an issue of understaffing.   The ONLY reason this restaurant is still in business has to be because competition for decent, relatively authentic Caribbean food does not exist in Charlotte.   It is such a shame because I love the island-like, Caribbean feel of the restaurant and the food is really good, but you have to have a lot of patience to deal with them and definitely not be hungry when you decide to dine at Mama's Caribbean. Too bad they choose to limit themselves in this way."}
{"text":"I will not be back to this restaurant. I placed an order for pickup last Thursday for myself and a co-worker. I had the small jerk meal and my co-worker had a side of collard greens. The chicken was hard, dry and cold. It wasn't fresh.  It was pulled from the fridge and put in the microwave. The beans were hard and rice chewy. The collard greens were bland. Very disappointing. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is one of worst restaurants I have been to in years. Food quality is terrible. The service was very slow. Luckily menus were already on the table so we didn't have to wait for that. The waitress showed when we were about to leave so we decided to order. Food quality was terrible. I ordered Jerk pork (Caribbean food so it should be a staple). I had to ask for a knife as this was the hardest piece of meat I have come across in years. I could only cut one of the seven pieces of meat, and it was all fat that I could not swallow. Remainders were like pieces of rock. I gave up and ate the plantains which were decent. If you go here, I highly recommend the pizza at the place across the street."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Their Jerk Chicken is, hands down, my favorite Jerk Chicken/Meal of all time.  Everyone is always super friendly and welcoming and the restaurant is clean. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I love this little place! It's nestled in the storefronts along Plaza Midwood and pretty easy to overlook unless you're really hungry. We stopped here last Saturday and it had a few people in it. Just like the previous review said, there was an older woman doing all the cooking and a young woman who served as waitress and bar service. I had the macaroni, which tastes nothing like the stereotypical box stuff, instead it was really spicy and way better than any Macaroni I had tasted before. My uncle had the wings, which were also really good. The drink menu is terrific, with sodas and fruit drinks that are beyond the expected. Really good, check it out."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Took 20 mins to be asked to place our order.  When we finally tracked down a waitress and asked basic questions about the menu (e.g. does the roti have potatoes?) the waitress said she didn't know and made no effort to find out.  The \"roti\" was a horrible mess of some kind of non-roti type of bread that was way too hard and think to be called anything but a pita.  No AC and it was 95Â° degrees today, so we were doing some extra sweating from the jerk sauce.   It had a 95 cleanliness rating, not horrible, I guess, but certainly not stellar.  Can't think of any reason to visit this place again."}
{"text":"The small jerk chicken was amazing! It came with red beans and rice along with some dynamite sweet potatoes! Certainly coming back for more taste of the Caribbean..."}
{"text":"One star for the food ,the food is great.. Don't really know where exactly to start.. The resturant itself is in a fast growing location,the food is great but the service and decor is so poor it make u not want to sit in..just order the food over the phone and pick it up really quick and go go go.I came to eat at the resturant yesterday because one of my coworker recommend but I didn't know I was walking into such disgusting place,the waitress are rude,unprofessional,loud,dirty and worst of all they don't look over 18y/o not to mention they have a full bar(don't u have to be 21+ to work at the bar?) just unprofessional and tasteless. The decor is stain and unattractive,the broken glass on the door had tape on it(had to laugh at that and shook my head)first time seeing a something like that (really tacky),inside the resturant is very dingy with stuff hanging from the ceiling and advertisements/wannabe artist art on the wall and ceiling high speaker box with no music playing ,the inside was kinda dark and the stage (I guess) look like a storage area it was really dirty I felt like I was in a horror movie..the paper on the glass make the place hard to find and the writing outside the door look like somewhere skaters hang out. This place need a lot of improvement need a makeover,Resturant makeover!!! Mamas Caribbean Grill NEED you.asap"}
{"text":"After seeing the negative reviews on this restaurant (be sure to read the filtered reviews also) I decided to give it a chance b/c everyone has different opinions on what is good. MAN, did I make a BIG mistake! There is only one way to describe this restaurant....sketchy! Looks dirty from the front. Looks dirty once you go inside. The food is sub par! I haven't had a lot of Jamaican food in Charlotte. But, I have had it in DC, Chicago, Atlanta. I love Jamaican food. The jerk chicken at this place tastes like someone just grilled chicken and let it sit in some jerk sauce for a bit. Worst of all, I caught the server putting his fingers in between his toes while sitting at the table watching the news. He went straight from that table to the kitchen picked up a togo order, and came back. I saw him the entire time. He did NOT wash his hands after picking his toe jam. Excuse me while I go regurgitate...."}
{"text":"A Jamaican friend took me to this restaurant for lunch today.  I live in the area, but for some reason had never eaten there.  I guess because of where it is located it is kind of obscure if you're not actually looking for it.   I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  I ordered a shrimp dish and my friend got the lunch special which REMAINS $4.99! ( I see it was the same price in 2010 according to a previous  review.  Amazing!)  There really IS a \"Mama\" and she is the sole cook.  She is a very nice older woman with strikingly attractive features and a wonderful lilting Jamaican accent. Our waitress was a  nice young American girl, who seemed to have a genuine almost \"family\" type relationship with \"Mama.\"  We felt very welcome and comfortable there.  It has the kind of relaxed environment that you'll enjoy when you just want to get away from the rat race for a tranquil respite.  The prices are good, and  our meals were delicious.  The Jamaican tea had just the right amount of citrusy sweetness to satisfy my sugar cravings, but  in a more healthy way than drinking a soda.    I'm looking forward to eating there again, and would recommend it to  anyone who is in that area and wants to try a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know a lot about Jamaican food but the jerk chicken I had tonight was excellent albeit, very messy. The place looks a little sketch from the outside and the owners kids were in the front screaming the whole time but the food was too good to complain."}
{"text":"Perfect.  Absolutely delicious, can't say enough.  I was desperate for really good Jamaican food after leaving Florida and my favorite spot in Sanford.  We literally stumbled on this little gem in the center of Plaza. The Brown Chicken was amazing, just like I remember and the plantains...oh my, like candy with just a hint of fried delicious crust....oh yeah.  The man had the jerk pork, also perfection....just enough heat to make you notice but not uncomfortable.  They have Sorrel which I didn't get to try but for will next time.  Staff was awesome, place was clean.  Great little spot."}
{"text":"Wonderful carribean restaurant! Food was authentic. Service was fast and friendly and priced just right. I had the oxtails rice and cabbage."}
{"text":"If you go, remember telling them how hot you want your jerk. The cook seems to like it very hot!!!! Nice simple place! Have a red stripe and ask for reggae music!"}
{"text":"Two stars are for the waitress and Mama. Unfortunately not the food. Not the worst I've had but definitely disappointing.   Where do I begin? This was a recommendation from a friend of a friend. She said it's better than Caribbean Hut over on Tryon street (which is far from me). I thought great....there's  nothing like having a favorite restaurant closer to home. So I met up with three girlfriends. We got there on a Saturday around 12:30 PM. Turns out the restaurant doesn't open up till 1 PM.  Fine..we'll just stand outside and talk for a few. 1 o'clock comes around and the young lady who's the hostess/waitress opens the door. Before we even sat down, she begins to tell us that they have no brown rice..just white rice. They also have no curry chicken, no brown stewed chicken and no black beans! I mean seriously... you are just opening up, and it's a Saturday and you don't have all those menu items?  Come on now!! That alone should've been a red flag but we were all gung ho for Caribbean food.   We were the first ones there so we sat down at a table and was brought over menus.  I already knew I wanted oxtails and my other friend knew she wanted oxtails also. The other two looked over the menu but only took a minute or two to figure it out. One ordered jerk pork, the other fish. So we sat and we sat waiting for her to come back to take our order. Now, remember the place just opened up. It's really not that busy. But there  were a few people at the bar getting to go orders. After waiting possibly 15 minutes, the waitress comes back and takes our orders.  At this point of time, she was the only waitress there. Maybe as the day gets busier, they have another one or two. She was nice. She seemed kind of cold when we got there but warmed up later. Finally our orders arrived. I think it was Mama herself who carried them out. She seemed like a very nice older woman.  I had ordered plantains for an appetizer, but they didn't arrive until after the entree.  They were fine but plantains are plantains. It's kind of hard to screw those up.   Now I love me some oxtails, and I was so looking forward to ordering another order or two to take home, but these weren't worth the wait or money. Usually the oxtails I've had at Jamaican restaurants have been so well seasoned and fall off the bone tender. These were just OK. I found the white rice kind of mushy.  The sweet potatoes weren't good and definitely from a can. I knew as soon as I saw them, they were from a can. The collard greens were nothing special. My friend who ordered the fish seemed to like hers. She wanted dessert, but guess what?  They didn't have any dessert.   After  all is said and done, I really wanted to like this place but there was nothing there that would make me want to go back or recommend. I think I'll stick with the other Jamaican restaurant.  It may be further from me, but definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"We arrived around 12:45 today, a Wednesday. We were the only people in the restaurant, which should have been a red flag. The server told us to sit wherever, and brought us menus. We both ordered the small jerk chicken with Mac and cheese. Literally 3 minutes later, the food came out. That's when I knew it was microwaved. The rice was barely hot, the peas never arrived, the Mac and cheese was gross and also not hot, and there was very little chicken- definitely not enough for $9. The jerk sauce was essentially gravy with jerk seasoning that had been simmering in a pot all morning. It had a burnt flavor to it. The server had an attitude the whole time and had more attitude when we asked why the food was microwaved. The only good part was that the chicken was hot. Still, the food did not meet even low expectations and the service was horrible. We definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"I've walked by the front door on my way to browse stores nearby in Plaza Midwood and have thought a hundred times of stopping in. A friend of mine and I used to always talk of stopping into Mama's. Four years of playing \"we should do this\" later, we stopped in. And it was pretty good.  There's a lunch special was $4.95 for a curry chicken, but we opted on oxtail and Caribbean jerk chicken. The best way to describe the oxtail was being like a chewier pot roast, and pretty nice with the plate's included rice and beans. I know wanting to try someplace out for years builds a lot of hype, so my expectations for the jerk chicken might have unfairly been a little high. The spice mix Mama uses for the chicken is great, with enough punch to brighten up the poultry that's a bit dry. If you have trouble picking side dishes (I can be indecisive, or maybe not), opt for the collard greens instead of the sweet potatoes. The portion is bigger, and the flavor is fuller. On that note, portions are plentiful-the small size will fill you up without making you feel like the Goodyear blimp.  Some of the other reviews have mentioned cleanliness and service. When we first came in, we did a lot of \"taking in the sights.\" The sights were a gigantic DJ booth and a wall of speakers, for the music they have on the weekends (that created even more of a mythical status for Mama's). The place looks a little grungy, but since the plywood outside wasn't a problem, I didn't have a problem with the floor and tables looking a little messy.  A lot of folks swung by for take-out orders (I'd like to try that out) or even just for a chat. There was one guy explaining his plan for fixing all the world's troubles as a small group of people gathered. We were leaving as he was starting to speak; now I wish we had stayed for it all."}
{"text":"I had a couple chicken patties because they were closing and had sold out of the beef. I don't know how the rest of the food but has an islander who also lived NYC for years I've been use to the bad island food in Charlotte. So I was refreshingly delighted to find good patties and very warm service even though they were closing."}
{"text":"I have not had good West Indian food since I moved to Charlotte until I ate here. And that's a 7 year timeframe. I gave Mama's a 4 for that reason, though it'd be more like a 3.5 due to service. I ordered a few items that weren't available and then asked for a recommendation... which wasn't available either. But the curry goat is always a good choice, and my personal favorite. The portions leave you full and the prices are reasonable. I will continue to recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Truth be told I was on my way a HIGHLY rated Gastrolounge, down the street, but on a Friday night it looked like a Mardi Gras Frat House from the outside and I didn't need drama.   On my way back to the car I was looking into the windows of the shops, and there I saw a direct portal to the Caribbean.   I was on the phone with with my wife. I told her, I was gonna go in and I hoped I didn't get stabbed.   Ordered a drink. Sitting at the bar. Still isn't here.  They are CRAZY overwhelmed.   Phone rings.    There's a man drunk man saying to the bar keep that another man has a knife. (No, I'm not kidding.)  A customer calls and the bar keep sets the phone down. She didn't want to 'deal' with them. Later I hear the busy tone.   Drunk people drama in the restaurant.   Still no drink.   But the bar keep make HERSELF a drink.   Food comes. It's not good.   I'm wasting my time.  I should have gone to that Gastrolounge.   ***I Really hope this was one big comedy of errors or this place is not gonna make it with service and food like this. ***  I wish the owners luck and hope this review helps to refine their customer experience."}
{"text":"Just no. I ordered the brown stew chicken with rice and peas and macaroni and cheese. Some of the blandest chicken I've tasted. The rice and peas were the same. The macaroni and cheese was like some type of experiment. They put curry in it. Who does that? I'm all for creating a unique experience to make people come back, but it didn't taste good. I tasted macaroni and curry, not cheese.'  I also tried the patty, o_O. The patties you buy at the grocery store that you put in the microwave tasted better than this.  I'm about to try Austin's, hopefully that's better."}
{"text":"You may like this place, If you are Jamaican.   The owner has brought in the third world feel, complete with bathroom doors that won't close at all.  Place is a pit.   And the food isn't anything to write home about either (maybe write home to Jamaica.)   I ordered pork, and it was pretty good.  The sweet potatoes came from a can.  The rice was nothing great.  Plantains were good!  oh yeah,  I pointed out the beer I wanted, and they were out, so I asked for something else, and all they had was warm beer! The music is so loud you can't hear the waiter, or your spouse.  Must be how they distract you from the run down atmosphere, and warm beer.   I won't be back.  Ever."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if I wanted to try this place after reading all the bad reviews. I only wanted plantains. They were actually really good and made fresh. The customer service was really good! As soon as I walked in everyone spoke and was really friendly.  I had I good experience, I'll go back and possibly try other things from the menu"}
{"text":"Their Beef patties are frozen out of a box, but they are still good. If you ever have a craving for a beef patty and a ting(Jamaican sprite made with REAL sugar), this is the place. I will note the place looks like its closed. They haven't replaced the piece of plywood covering the broken window in over a year..."}
{"text":"Genuine employees, tasty food, relaxing reggae music, great drink prices and the best vibes."}
{"text":"We just moved to Charlotte and are so excited that our daughter found this place on Yelp! We enjoyed the friendly environment and great food.  Everyone was pleased, even my picky four year old!  My husband had oxtail and curry goat.  I enjoyed roti with curry chicken.  My daughter loves the spicy escovitch fish.  My youngest had sides of rice, macaroni and a bit of curry goat!  My teenager opted for a more simple meal of a beef patty, plantain and coco bread!  We will be back!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Im a fair person, but I'm also honest. this restaurant was terrible. as a fitness fanatic, i was extra disappointed because i picked this place for my cheat meal which i only allow myself to indulge in once a week. therefore i take my cheat meals very seriously! it had an unpleasant odor when we walked in. i don't have a great sense of smell so i didn't notice the odor but my husband did. he just didn't say anything until after the fact because he knew i was so excited about trying this place and he was too. once we were seated, the server never brought us water. we had to ask about it. she finally brought the water with meals. in other words, we sat there that whole time (prior to them bringing our meal) with no water! as for the food, it was not fresh. the beans amd rice tasted like uncle ben's, the yams tasted canned (or if they were from scratch they certainly weren't fresh), and the meat was gross. again im a fair person. im not fussy about food. i just like GOOD food. so for me to bash this place it has to be really bad. ive had good Jamaican food so i know what it's \"supposed\" to taste like. for example, stir it up (Jamaican restaurant in ATL's little 5 points area) is fantastic....local, quaint, homemade, fresh and AUTHENTIC. is mama's edible? yes. is it good? no."}
{"text":"This place serves up Jamaican soul food that's the most authentic in town. And by \"authentic\" I also mean that the restaurant keeps close to its Jamaican roots: the service can be slow, it can take a while to get your food, regardless of how busy (or slow) the place is, the staff keeps the heat on even in summer, and the place looks a little grungy. It's good eats, but sometimes I wonder about the place."}
{"text":"Yay! This place has never let me down. I went in, there was new staff. They were friendly but seems busy. I ordered jerk chicken with mac & cheese, and cabbage, 3 chicken patties, and 3 drinks (mamas tea and sorrell). They were out of chicken patties so got veggie. We waited awhile but I talked with the staff while I waited.  Got the food and I have to be honest I didn't get a picture but I crushed that food. I usually do white meat but they no longer serve it so had to do thighs. The jerk chicken tasted very good and had tons of sauce. The mac and cheese was okay and cabbage really good. The veggie patties were good, although I miss getting the chicken patties. The drinks were great. I love their juices, they are a must try. I will be back to the restaurant. The staff was friendly. Good portions of foods. The food was tasty. I really enjoyed eating there."}
{"text":"What's with all the 4 stars?  Jamaican me crazy, mon!  I've live walking distance away... been meaning to try this place out for 4 years.  Tonight I finally got my chance.  I've had the real deal in Jamaica and this took me back.  The jerk chicken is perfect.  Just enough spice to keep things interesting.  Rice and beans included and the small comes with an additional side.  I got 2 small jerk chickens, one with mac and cheese and the other with sweet potatoes (or yams?)  Both were great, but I'll be getting the yams next time.  If ya cravin' real Jamaican jerk chicken, no problem mon.  Ya found it here."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some good jerk chicken and stumbled upon this hole in the wall Caribbean restaurant on Central Ave with a friend.  I ended getting the small jerk chicken plate with rice, peas, Mac n Cheese, and collard greens for $9.  The server warned me that the jerk chicken was spicy and I told her that was fine. She then took it upon herself to come back again and make sure that i was okay with the heat.. I told her yes once again.. she didn't bother my friend about spiciness.. so the consensus was that it was because I was white.  Atmosphere: It was rather dreary and there were more flies in the restaurant than there were people.  It only took 10 minutes before our plates came out and the server looked at me and said \"have fun..\"  The jerk chicken was spicy, but in the best possible way! It was moist and fall off the bone perfect. My friend loved it too, but he was the one that was struggling with the heat; he ended up eating it in intervals. The rice, peas, and collard greens were bland. The Mac n Cheese was alright, it tasted a bit old.  3/5 because the jerk chicken was good enough to endure some underlying racism."}
{"text":"Well after reading some reviews I thought I would try this place. I thought the safe thing to order would be the Jerk Chicken. They give you PLENTY of food for the price. There is a descent beer selection, but no hard alcohol. When I walked in though, I thought someone had died; there were only 2 people waiting on food; the man working behind the counter started my visit off by yelling at someone on the phone. He then began to talk to me and he was a very nice guy, I believe someone on the phone was screwing with him.   I then asked him about playing some music b/c there were some sound boards up in the front; he said he forgot to turn the music on b/c he was reading a book. So the overall experience was questionable. I took the food to go and was  pretty good, but I'm not going to be running back just because of everything I witnessed."}
{"text":"Tiny place across from Fuel Pizza.  Mama is a remarkable older Jamaican woman who does all the cooking.  Her very sweet granddaughter is learning how to be a waitress. There are four or five tables, a small bar with imported and domestic beer and booze.  Up front there are speakers and I am told that they have an open mike night.  I ask them how they would feel about me singing Danny Boy or Vintage Hank Senior.  He said \"bring it on\".  This place has a ways to go to iron out some of the kinks. Please Please some one give them help with a web site. The food? What we had ( three of us)  was absolutely fantastic.  The best Jerk Chicken I have ever tasted. (very spicy)  Curry Shrimp (Very large portion) very spicy and delicious.  We also had rice and beans, collard greens the best steamed cabbage that I have had in some time,  and boiled bananas and yams.  These are not yams as in sweet potatoes but some Caribbean variant.  There are a number of call ahead specialty items (Callalou, Fry Dumplings among others.   Something called Roti, Oxtail, Curry Goat and many other fascinating items.  My friend who bummed around Jamaica for a time assured me that this was the real deal.  I hope they iron out some of their problems so that they remain in business.  The clientele when we were there was mostly Jamaican.  I loved every thing I tried and will certainly go back soon. Oh every thing is available as carry out and they advertise a $4.99 lunch special."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant about a week ago and was thoroughly disappointed. After reading the reviews, I was really expecting a nice dinner out. First of all, it's a very small establishment. Don't be fooled by the pictures you see online like I was. The service is what killed the whole experience from the start. I don't know if its a cultural thing, but the wait staff was terrible. Not personable at all. The beef patty and the jerk chicken wings were pretty good. My main meal was the curry chicken. It was nothing to rave about. The rice & beans that came with it tasted like they had been burnt in the pot they were cooked in. Or as my friend, who joined me described, \"they tasted like an ashtray\". Disgusting right?! They did have a live band playing, and they were good but the place is just too small to enjoy your meal and listen to music in. We couldn't hear each other talking at all. And again, it's a really small place, so we should've been able to. I consider myself a foodie type person, and I don't see myself ever returning to this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding Caribbean food!! We tried several dishes and everything was outstanding.. Jerk chicken, brown stewed chicken, curry chicken and veggies.. We have 2 small girls and they loved it also.. Our waitress was zahra and I don't have enough space to write a review about how awesome she was both in service and being sweet w our girks.. She learned their names, referred to them every time she came to table, and she asked for hugs after we were done and the girls talked about her a lot.. Please do yourself a favor and check it out.. We will be back soon;)"}
{"text":"We ordered stew chicken and curry chicken with Mac well the mac and cheese was spoiled it made the whole up its a wrap won't eat there again now I know why I stopped before"}
{"text":"I have lost all hope in Mama after some less than stellar experiences but my BF insisted that he wanted Jamaican and since Mama's is only down the street why not?  So I get inside and I am halfway greeted by a friendly yet drunk fellow at the bar. The cashier?, waitress?, chick behind the bar, gives little to no notice I'm even there. I hand her my card, gives me my food &&I'm out.. I already know not to expect so much in the service dept.   When I get home I check my BF food and I am disgusted by what I see. A half jerk wing/ thigh, a sad attempt a macaroni and cheese shells edition, and rice and peas (see picture)   I couldn't see how can an establishment that prides themselves at being authentic Jamaican cuisine allow a dish to leave the kitchen like this. Where was the passion? Where was the love of the culinary craft?  On a positive note, although the food looked completely dissatisfying my BF who was dying of hunger and who eats pretty much ANYTHING completed his entire meal without much complaint. When I asked him how it was he replied \"I'm still kinda hungry, but it was straight  \"  Hmm perhaps I have too high expectations.."}
{"text":"It's not the best Jamaican food it is quite forgettable bet I guess it gets the job done"}
{"text":"Dropped in this evening. The fish stew with red snapper was tasty. Really loved the collards and sweet potatoes. Would go back for them alone. Server was helpful and food was quick considering move was made to order."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the lunch here today, a small plate of goat curry that came with rice and collard greens.  It was my first time eating goat, and the curry it was cooked in was delicious.  Although it was a small plate, the amount of food they give you is more than enough.  So order the large plate only if you are super hungry, or if you are a big eater.  Service was friendly and unobtrusive.  This restaurant is definitely on my favorites list."}
{"text":"Grabbed a Chicken Roti from here. Wanted it in a wrap but didn't come that way. Food is good and worth the drive for me from South Charlotte. Had a lot to choose from on the menu. Live band was getting ready to play but couldn't stay. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I would first like to say the owner is the nicest lady ever. The food is horrible. Im not sure what Jamaican or Jerk Chick lover would like this place. It's basically chicken with a gravy sauce.  Do not go here for Jerk Chicken if you have had real Jerk chicken in Jamaica. This is all the way bad. But if you want to support a nice older lady then that is ok. Just don't go for the Jerk Chicken"}
{"text":"Utterly a disappointment. I've wasted money on food before however, this was the hardest mistake to swallow. The rice was burnt, the sweet potatoes lacked flavor as well as the greens. Mac and cheese was over cooked and lacked seasoning as well. The curry chicken neglected to have seasoning. They forgot to add my chicken pattie and coco bread to my order.  Mama was sitting near the kitchen and it was a total misrepresentation of her establishment. This is one of the FEW places in Charlotte to get authenticity and it failed the people miserably. This is the McDonald's of Caribbean food. Horrible. No substance. No soul.  I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a couple of friends. This was my 2nd time eating here. Service was great. The food was good. I had a veggie patty which was so good and seasoned just right. I  had the veggie plate with rice and peas cabbage and mac & cheese. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Nice and quiet. They give you a huge plate of food and they have a nice selection of food, considering the prices they should. The service is good, the guy serving us was very nice. I got the curry chicken, collard greens and macaroni and cheese with a beef patty and i was in heaven. my hubby got the jerked chicken, cabbage and sweet potatoes and he was a happy camper too. Overall we were pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero. I would. This was the worse food I have ever had in my life. If I wanted unseasoned canned vegetables I would have went to target. And my food was cold to the touch. The jerk chicken, the collard greens and these disgusting canned sweet potatoes were all cold. I asked for a side of jerk sauce to pour over my cold rice...miraculously that came out steaming... After sitting with a cold plate for 30 minutes. The waitress never returned so I went to the bar to pay for our meals.. I was given the 1 minute finger while she answered the phone and took an order for 15 minutes. I asked someone else to process my payment. They told me to wait until the other girl got off the phone. Oh ok. STAY AWAY. Thank goodness it's Super Bowl Sunday and I'm headed to a party later or I'd surely starve."}
{"text":"There was no one to great me and my friend when we walked into the restaurant. Our waiter was sitting down and then she noticed us. She grabbed some menus and stood there for a few minutes while we looked at the menu before walking away. She came back moments later but didn't ask if we were ready she just stood there and my friend ordered then I told her what I wanted. The food came out quick and we didn't get our water until the food came out. She gave us bottled water and we were confused. She decided we would have bottled waters and not tab. I was OFFENDED. We ordered jerk chicken mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. The food was plated nicely and good although everything was spicy. OVERDOSE ON GHOST PEPPER AND SCOTCH BONNET PEPPERS. The waitress never asked how our meal was or offered us any more water. There was no service Im shocked especially at a place with linens and such you would assume there would be someone to take care of you. She gave us the check we paid and she didn't wait until we left before grabbing the signed copy. Instead she came over and asked if we were finished so she could take it. Never thanked us for our service. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"I ordered curry chicken withe rice and peas along with cabbage. The taste was good but the wait was like over a half hour. I recommend to call ahead."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. I love Jamaican food. This was such a drag. The atmosphere was fine - the place is kind of a hole in the wall, with plenty of character and I have no problem with that. Kind of dark, cool stage area up front and cute little bar in the back.  Sort of felt like walking into someones house, and I like that feeling. We sat ourselves and the server was nice. No complaints so far. I ordered brown stew chicken and my partner ordered jerk chicken. Rice and peas and macaroni and cheese. Now, jerk chicken is grilled after being coated with a dark jerk spice marinade, if being done super legit, its grilled over coal. What arrived looked like it came out of a crock pot. Imagine if you ordered a flame grilled burger and someone brought you a sloppy joe type thing in a bowl.  That was definitely NOT jerk chicken. I'm surprised they were trying to pass it off as such.  It was sort of bland, mushy. My brown stew chicken was more legit, but was still bland. The stewed chicken was dry, almost hard in the middle. Really weird. Where's the scotch bonnet heat? Rice and peas was pretty good, the mac and cheese was unmemorable and sort of yellow and grainy. I hope they turn it around, but it's evident that someone here just doesn't care. Sad."}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken platter with rice and beans and mac and cheese. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and is spicy but only on your lips. Once you eat it there's so much flavor. I've never gotten any heartburn from their spices and with jerk chicken that's sometimes hard to find. I've been going here for years and it's always been constantly good food for good prices."}
{"text":"Terrible food, I was sadly disappointed! I had curry shrimp, which on the menu states \"jumbo shrimp\", I got medium shrimp that u get cooked frozen in a bag from Walmart....furthermore, it had no taste... Stew chicken was ok... Don't waste your time or money, chef can't cook!!"}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken with collard greens and  mac and cheese. Just ok, probably won't go back.  It wasn't bad, just nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"We got some food for take out and it was pretty good.  They were out of beef patties but the chicken pattie was delish!  Curry shrimp was good, but Caribbean Hut still has the best.  However, their jerk chicken was spicy and tender.  They messed up on one of my sides, gave me yams instead of cabbage...so be sure to check your food before you leave if you get it to go.  I will be back for those patties though, they are addictive!    I am giving them one star because I actually came back for the those beef patties on Sunday and they were not even open on time (I came early on a Sunday at 12pm and waited an hour)...now that's TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Trash, the service was absolutely horrible, the food was under seasoned and bland and the Mgt tried to argue us down about something the was clearly wrong with one of our dishes instead of simply asking \"Would You Like Something Else\" from the start.  If your looking for authentic Caribbean food, I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic food! Great service too. Came in 15 minutes before they were closing and they took care of us like kings and queens."}
{"text":"This place definitely has the best Curry Goat around the downtown NC sides. I loved every second of it. The food came out super quick and the waitress was very attentive. Sometimes they run out of stuff like beans , which is not good if you're looking to order Jerk Chicken. Otherwise it was a good experience and I enjoyed it a lot !"}
{"text":"Before sitting down ask what is available. We got there at 8 pm on a Saturday night.... Took them at least 15 minutes to even come to the table and acknowledge is. In fact, we had to go up to the bar to ask for menus while they attended to other duties.... The restaurant was not that busy.   When the waitresses come to the table, she started by listing of all the items that they did not have available at the time. No word of a lie, they had four entrees left on the menu.... Only for us to place our order and then for the waitress to come back 10 minutes later to tell us there was only enough to make one of our orders.    At this point, we asked for the bill (we had ordered drinks with our entrees) paid and left. Whack! Other things to do on a Saturday night and then sit, be ignored, and waste time.  PS the fork given to us had dried rice in it and the napkins placed on our table were dirty. Yuck."}
{"text":"This Caribbean restaurant is definitely serving some authentic dishes. The jerk pork and curry chicken was delicious!! Cabbage and peas and rice took me back to Jamaica. This place is a must try and we will return!"}
{"text":"I have been craving Caribbean food for the past two weeks and this place hit the spot.  The space is cozy and comfortable.  The service was good considering there were 20 of us....  I don't think they are use to large crowds.  The patties were yum and the food was extremely flavorful.  I would definitely visit again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Brown Stew Chicken is crazy!!!!!! Never had anything quite like it and the Mac & Cheese is so cheesy, it's incredible!!!!! Yummy!! The service was okay but it's Monday so I won't hold it against them :D"}
{"text":"A little know area for me visiting Charlotte but the food was amazing... Friendly service and a great selection of Jamaican food. Will be back again ."}
{"text":"It's really  a 3.5 star.   As you would expect,  the food is very reasonabley priced. Overall the quality was good.  Some of the vegetables were obviously canned and little had been done to enhance the flavor and texture. Don't expect much for atmosphere or service. Good, not great.  I'd give it another try to experience some other flavors and give it a final judgment."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and will keep coming back. I love the authenticity of the flavors. I always seem to gravitate to the curry goat. I've also had the jerk chicken and it's just as wonderful. I plan on trying the oxtail next time !!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for authentic Jamaican food. Went there a couple times and tried the oxtails and the curry goat. Amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Best Caribbean Food in Charlotte by far. Nice price, huge portions and great music. Very authentic and good service."}
