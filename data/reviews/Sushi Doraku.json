{"text":"We have visited this restaurant may time before but will not be returning. My guess is that business is not doing very well so they are cutting back on servings. We ordered the Sashimi Combination which is fairly expensive but have never seen such small slices of Sashimi. The meal was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is very good for both sushi and service! The sushi they serve is always delicious and the service is fast and efficient. The decor is pleasing and they play very nice mood music, I would recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Chef made me a special which was divine. Couldn't be happy with our choice!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had a first-time encounter here for my birthday.  Food was well prepared in a nice ambience, with convenient access.  Wife has gluten intolerance, and they accommodated her needs nicely."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi in the area. Very friendly and great service. My favorite roll would have to be the Spicy Tuna Fry."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time today and the sushi was really good! I wouldnt say it was the best sushi ive ever had but the price was very fair. The service was very friendly and I will most definitly be returning."}
{"text":"We use to live right down the street from here and sorely miss our favorite sushi place! Every time we're in town we try to stop here. The chimichanga roll (no rice....deep fried, delicious and keto-friendly) has been my go-to, but we've taken to trying new rolls each time and have yet to be disappointed. This time I tried the Fire roll and it was presented and tasted unlike any sushi I'd had before. But it was awesome and you should definitely try it."}
{"text":"The service was good.  The waitress was attentive and nice.  She even allowed my son to bring in his food from next door (he doesn't do sushi yet).  The fish was very fresh.  Some of the best I have had since moving to the NW Valley.  I had salmon, ahi, and yellowtail nigiri all were buttery tender and perfect light flavor.  I also had one roll that was real good that included salmon, ahi, yellowtail, crab stick, masago, and asparagus wrapped in cucumber instead of seaweed. It was a great combination and the cucumber made it has this super fresh sensation I loved.  I will definitely be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Ordered pork Katsu curry for $15. It was aggressively average. A little overpriced but was a larger portion size. I didn't leave hungry like my friends who ordered sushi. Sushi was too expensive per roll for me. I did try a few pieces off my friends plate. Don't get volcano or doraku #7. Vegas was alright. You get 12 pieces of fish in the chirashi bowl. For $20 I passed.

Service was a little slow and needed to ask sushi chef questions about their menu. Definitely needs more training.

The pork katsu curry just made me want to go to a LOL Hawaiian bbq. Don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Excellent Li'l place.. stopped in for lunch. Spicy tuna and the tuna and yellowtail very fresh and tasty. Great bar service as well.. will be back when I am out this way."}
{"text":"First time coming here and hated it. The waiter only came twice to the table. One to take the orders, and the second time to drop off the drinks. 30 minutes roll by with no refills or food, i had to get up and ask for the refill myself. We were outside and he never bothered to look over so we couldn't even get his attention. Then the other waiters started helping us picking up his slack. Our original waiter wasn't even busy all he did was walk around to \"check\" the tables. He wasn't cleaning, serving or anything, I don't plan on coming here again, ill just go to the squid ink across the street for better food and better service."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a lazy Thursday afternoon, decided on the spider and geisha roll, absolutely divine! The geisha roll in particular was fantastic! I would've ordered two of it had I known ahead! Very few customers so service was super fast. Place is nice and clean with a mellow ambiance, it's a nicely hidden hole-in-the-wall place so it feels private, great for a getaway or romantic date!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Chefs Sean and Martin are great people and make some great sushi. Edison the server when I was there was also very friendly and helped me pick some great food when I was indecisive. It is a smaller place but that just means they are more attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"Great sushi, excellent service, zero complaints. We went there because we walked out of Squid Ink across the street due to bad service. The waitress at Doraku made up for it 100%, very genuine, personable and prompt. 
The crazy avocado and garlic edamame are delicious. So is the sushi, though I wish the baked lobster roll would not taste smoked. 
I would recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Peoria!!!!!! Every roll that we've ever gotten has been amazing, and their ramen is awesome as well! Service is always very friendly and patient!"}
{"text":"Had the bento box.  Good for peripheral food on the new community area.  If it was downtown/ biltmore area it probably would've come in at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Solid sushi spot on this side of town.  Always fresh and delicious.  Our go to spot!  We are regulars, love the basic spicy tuna rolls, as well as the specialty rolls.  They are ur go to last minute dinner.  Love their gyoza, garlic edamame, philly bros roll, very fresh sashimi.  We love the yellow tail and ahi."}
{"text":"We've eaten here numerous times, but more often than not get take out. They have a fairly large selection of sushi rolls. My favorite is the Sunset Roll, but we also haven't tried anything we haven't liked.  Everything is always fresh and packed full of all the good stuff, not just rice with a spec of fish. 

If you are tired of all the sushi places on this side of town that have menus full of California Rolls topped with various sauces, then you need to stop in to Doraku!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were planning on going to Squid Ink but decided to try something new instead. We were pleasantly surprised! The service was excellent, our server greeted us right away, we never ran out of tea or water, and the food came out quickly. We split a chicken bowl, spicy tuna roll, and a tootsie roll. The tootsie was my favorite and my mom loved the spicy tuna! The chicken bowl was delicious as well. All of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. :) We paid 20 for the meal (not including tip). Absolutely a great experience, we will be back here often!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken and beef bowl. This was literally all the meat we got in the beef bowl. Before posting we wanted to confirm if it was right or maybe a mistake. They confirmed this was all they put usually. Hahahaha. I would make a joke , saying I think I'll bring my own meat next time, but unfortunately there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Had the Dragon Roll, Caterpillar Roll with Miso soup.  Great food, Katrina was our waitress and she was amazing.  She brought my son a happy birthday dessert, because she overheard us speaking about. Will definitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We eat there twice a month usually between 6-7. We sit up by the sushi bar and George is excellent at making us awesome sushi. It is reasonably priced and good portions as well. It is a good change of pace from the hustle and bustle sushi places."}
{"text":"I genuinely dislike writing poor reviews, but this one was earned.

The service was friendly, but the sushi is not that great.

I ordered the Sushi Special #1 (chef's choice) + order of Ala cart Unagi.  This combo comes with salad and miso soup.  The salad was tasty, and the miso soup is about like what you would expect.

When my main course came out, I was surprised that the Chef 'selected' Unagi as one of the sushi pieces.  He _knew_ I also ordered Unagi ala cart.  So why not choose an alternate?  This leads me to believe there is no real thought put into the \"Chef's choice\".  It probably doesn't even vary seasonally.

I really enjoy Octopus, but I was almost unable to chew the piece I was served.  The Nigiri sushi was \"inexpertly\" assembled.  The amount of rice and wasabi included varied _wildly_ from piece to piece.  The salmon was 'flopped' over a sad 'half-sized' portion of rice.

I could go on, but I think I made my point."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service. We were in the area and stopped to look at menu, and decided to give this place a try. The staff is extremely polite and attentive. I ordered the ramen noodle bowl with veggies, and was happy to see that they used a variety of delicious vegetables. They even finish off your meal with a cute orange peel treat. Will be definitely be coming back, and have already recommended to family and friends!"}
{"text":"This place used to be Fresh Wasabi, which was meh. Now it is AWESOME! We had to stick to cooked rolls because I'm pregnant but I can't WAIT to come back and try the real stuff in a few weeks after baby is here! Service is great, food very fresh! Much better than the other option across the street."}
{"text":"We came here to have a birthday dinner. We bought a cake from Cold Stone Creamery because it was just a few stores down, and we had to ask the ice cream store to hold it until we were ready to serve because the restaurant didn't have room. 

The food came out fairly quickly. The appetizers came out first. The squid salad seemed sort of small for the price. Then came the rolls and sashimi. The rolls were pretty good, but the tuna sashimi, specifically, wasn't very fresh. We added the hamachi kama, and this one hit the mark. It is typically grilled and therefore less fishy, but this was the opposite. Overall, sushi doraku was ok...but not quite worth the higher price tag."}
{"text":"Had high expectations of this place based on the reviews. Was deciding between Doraku and Squid Ink across the street. The wait staff was accommodating and friendly, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this place.

Cons:
1) The wait for food. It took over 30 minutes to even receive our first dish! The restaurant wasn't terribly busy and we were already really hungry. 
2) Serving portion. For about $12 / roll, the sushi portions were very meager. Expected more.
3) Taste. The sushi was okay. Definitely had better tasting and fresher sushi before. The most disappointing item was the \"ramen\". First, it wasn't advertised to be spicy, but it was. Secondly, this was NOT Japanese ramen. It was a pack of Korean Nong Shim Shin Ramyun that I could have bought and prepare for under $1 from an Asian market. They threw some meat inside and called it \"ramen\". They charged $8 for this. 

Should have went with the other sushi place across the street."}
{"text":"Great sushi,  nice and quiet little place. We'll be back for sure to try more of their special concoctions!"}
{"text":"This place was really good.  Great happy hour. Fantastic service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The signature rolls here are delicious and very large.  The standard house rolls are also very nice and are an easier bite size. Both are great. They have fresh wasabi available for a little extra cash. The dining room is small so get there early if you don't want to wait.  The servers are friendly."}
{"text":"We have recently moved to the area and my husband loves sushi. Me, not so much. Whereas most sushi places only offer sushi or a few other things, Sushi Doraku offers many other options such as bowls, fried rice, yakisoba and Ramen. We went for lunch today. I ordered the tempura bento box. Miso soup, salad, 2 tempura shrimp, 4 tempura vegetables, edamame and 8 pieces of California Roll (which my husband devoured) for 13 bucks. I think that is a steal.

My husband got 3 different rolls. One was covered in hot Cheetos and tomatillo salsa. It was very unique.

The server was very friendly and attentive. Since we live in the area and my husband loves sushi and I can eat other things, I see us becoming regulars."}
{"text":"Ordered some sushi to go so didn't experience the service. Was a small restaurant with not many tables. Sushi was ready within 10 minutes of my call in. Decent portion size for the price. Good flavor but could not tell the difference between my salmon and crab so that was a little weird because I eat sushi often and those two have distinct flavor differences. I'm only in the area on vacation so would probably try a different location for sushi next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and it was actually really good! The sushi had a lot of flavor and their chicken fried rice was delicious. I would recommend this place. The staff was very inviting as well!"}
{"text":"The food was good. We had the green mussels, 2 teriyaki kids dishes, and 4 different rolls. Fav roll is the geisha, unique and wrth the 11.95...the other specialty roll we got was tiger in the ?? The ground spicy tuna is what brought the flavor down a bit. Not a fan of ground seafood. Overall, nice atmosphere and decent prices. Will be back"}
{"text":"Bad, real bad, michael jackson bad. As yeesus would say.

Tried this place out recently.  I tried an eel roll.  I cant remember the name of it but it was tiny, the rice was too sticky, and the roll completely fell apart.  The rice was so over cooked it was literally sticking to the chop sticks.  Couldnt have been much worse if they tried.

Also tried the miso soup.  It tasted like it was based off concentrate.  

The asahi beer was good.  I wish this area could get just one good restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my teen son the other day for lunch. It was on the way home, so why not. We were hoping they served bento box. This was a Tuesday afternoon, around 1PM. On the window they had the menu which was nice as we could see what they served before we even sat down, it sure beats being seated and looking through the menu to find nothing, then leaving. We've done this before. Anywho, seen they did offer bento boxes so we happily went in. 

Upon walking in, there was a screen of some sort separating the entrance from the seating area. The hostess/waitress was friendly and said we could choose any seat. We were the only ones there for the time being. She was quick to offer us a drink, as well as give us menus. Didn't really examine the menu, but we both ordered a bento box. Mine was teriyaki chicken, son's was teriyaki beef. We also ordered 2rolls, toosie and tuna.  Those were 2 rolls for $7.50 

First came out our bowl of miso soup. That was hot and delicious. Then came out our sushi rolls. Very tasty, nice presentation. I believe there were 6 pieces per roll. Last came out the bento box. In each box there was a  green salad, 3 pieces of tempura veg with sauce, edamame, and our choice of spicy crab roll or California. I chose the spicy crab. That was very good, not too spicy but enough kick. My chicken teriyaki came on a bed of cabbage? The chicken was diced, some tender, some tough. Overall the bento box was good. The only thing I noticed as did my son as he said it first was that the box didn't come with any rice. All the other sushi places we have eaten at always serve a scoop of rice. Being Asian ourselves, rice is a staple. Oh well. Customer service was excellent. Our waitress was sweet, prompt, and attentive. 

Not sure if I'd return as the prices were a bit high. I believe I walked out spending around $50 after tip for 2 bento boxes & 2 sushi rolls. I've been to similar places that were less $$."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were very good, my husband and I got a few rolls, our favorite was the sunset roll, it had lemon slices on it..  the service was ok.  They would not give us ginger until the food came out along with our Edamame.  All of it came at the same time. Every time we asked for ginger, it was just a couple of bites.."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local susi place.  Lots on the menu to keep us very satisfied.  Service is always nice and fast.  Food is fresh.  We have been going for years.  We tired other local sushi places and nothing comes close.  Check out daily specials too.  Our children love it here too!"}
{"text":"Better and cheaper than Squid Ink across the intersection...fresh, priced right, great food. Go here for sushi in N Peoria!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, great environment, killer prices for the value! Highly recommend the \"Tiger in the Jungle\" roll, and chefs choice sashimi plate was delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good that I'm writing the review before I leave. Sushi Doraku had the best sushi offerings I'm the north valley, very good reverse happy hour (7:30-9 pm) deals, and a great service minded staff. speaking of their sushi rolls, they offer excellent diversity, including creative sushi rolls I haven't seen anywhere else, like their geisha roll that has mango sauce on it.

This will be our new go to sushi bar."}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour and had the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Cucumber Salad. I must say that it was very good. The two gents working were very helpful and attentive to my needs. The place is clean and modern. 

My total bill came to $8 and I was stuffed. What more could I ask for on a Monday afternoon in Arizona. Gives Blue Sushi in Omaha a run for their money. Get here from 2 to 5 PM and go home with a happy belly."}
{"text":"So fresh and staff is wonderful, my fav place in Peoria! The rolls are fresh and so yummy and the chefs are so kind and welcoming!"}
{"text":"The food = 5 stars. My wife and I eat here whenever we get a rare date night and want some quality sushi. This is not fancy establishment which is fine by us. It appears to be a small business owned and operated by a family. The reason for the four stars is that for some reason when we got our ticket there was an extra beer on their. I only had one and the ticket had 2. I would hope it was an honest mistake but I am glad I noticed. That said, we will return here again. I highly recommend the Green Mussel and Monkey Brain from the appetizer menu. Both are favorites of ours."}
{"text":"Cute little place! Got togo the other day and it was delicious. It looks a little small when you first walk in but the food is great! They made sure to cater to my allergens and were super nice about it. Will def be returning!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Poke was best. Excellent variety of rolls. No grilled chicken or salmon teriyaki which was disappointing. Only offering was pan fried. Edamame fresh and well seasoned."}
{"text":"This place is great! Been there twice now and wasn't disappointed either time. Had the yaki soba bowl first time and the katsu curry this time. My friend had a ramen bowl each time. Great flavor, large portion. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband, two boys and I tried Sushi Doraku for the first time tonight. We were pleasantly surprised! We love sushi and finally found a go-to spot near our home. The sushi was fresh and delicious. We ordered the edemame, gyoza, ramen, chicken yaki soba, kid's chicken plate, a crunch roll and a salmon tempura roll. All of our food was fantastic! The service was great and they brought us an adorable and yummy complimentary dessert to finish. We will definitely be visiting here often and are also looking forward to ordering take out!"}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding cliche, this little sushi place is a diamond in the rough. It sits in between a Cold stone creamery and a Dunkin Donuts but a chain restaurant it is not. Across the street is the ever so popular sushi restaurant Squid Ink, but trendy and over priced this place is most definitely not!

I come here at least twice a month by myself as a special end of the week treat. I sit in my usual corner booth while I again go over the menu for a deviant of the usual sushi rolls and salads. I order a glass of Chardonnay because it's Friday after all and maybe a squid or cucumber salad for starters. Sometimes I get crazy and have the sushi chef pick something unusual for me. They never fail to impress. 

I know sushi. This is extraordinary sushi in an unpretentious atmosphere with friendly service and unbeatable prices. Happy Friday my friends! 

My special recommendation, try the Tuna Tataki Salad!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great ownership... we have been going here since it was fresh wasabi... the new ownership is very nice and very attentive to their good customers. Awesome group of people"}
{"text":"Order anything BUT the ramen here. I was so disappointed when I ordered their ramen only to find out that it was instant ramen with a flavor packet --no toppings, no extra things to level up a cheap instant noodle pack."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour menu, good food and service.  Good selection of non-sushi meals for people who don't eat sushi.  There are other sushi restaurants nearby and we were glad we chose to eat here."}
{"text":"Sushi was tasty and overall satisfying. However, All the sushi tasted the same. We ordered 4 different rolls and could barely tell a difference between them. Great happy hour prices though."}
{"text":"Small very average sushi restaurant that also offers some other Asian Foods. We tried a variety of sushi and some were better than others. The non-traditional Fire Roll was the best of what we tried. The day we were here the rice wasn't too sticky and much of the sushi fell apart.

 We also tried the Korean Fried Chicken. It looked very good when they brought it out but when we went to eat it the chicken inside was almost cold and was dry and chewy. I wouldn't recommend getting the Korean Fried Chicken here.

Service was average......

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Awesome little sushi place, the atmosphere is nice and the sushi was delicious.  Tried a few different rolls and some yummy miso soup ! Definitely will come back ! They also have awesome happy hour deals !"}
{"text":"Small sushi joint tucked away in North Peoria. Cool little spot that great for small groups (is a tiny restaurant). Owner was attentive while serving us and the man making the sushi rolls (young white guy) made great rolls! Rainbow rolls were my favorite, the spicy yellowtail was par to anywhere else and I did not enjoy the fried shrimp roll (not my cup of tea). Nonetheless, great service and good sushi. We will return in the future."}
{"text":"Best Sushi by far we have had in Arizona. The fish is so fresh and tasty. We came on a Sunday which they have reverse happy hour all day. The food was amazing a priced right. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Stop by after work on a Monday, it wasn't busy. Ordered the \"Monkey Brain\", Fried avocado rolls and their chicken udon. Love the taste of the monkey brain, which is fried spicy tuna and mushroom with a really good sauce. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I love it here. 
Being a long time veteran, I do have my biased opinion but for good reasons...

Reason 1) Sean, the chef, is very creative with his rolls and there are always new and upcoming rolls written on the neon blackboard behind the sushi bar. Do not expect to be wowed by simple tuna or yellowtail rolls which come a dime a dozen these days. Be adventurous and order the Fire Roll, the Second Climax Roll, the Geisha Roll, and the Tiger in the Jungle... You get my point. 
Reason 2) They serve uni. This is a delicacy and you must have an open palette to appreciate it but it's always fresh. Typically at pricey seafood restaurants, like the ones I frequent in California or Seattle, I have to donate an arm and a leg to get this uni which usually is served artistically in the halved sea urchin \"shell\" but the portion is so small that you feel like crying because you were just robbed. But here at Sushi Doraku, I can enjoy tons of it when it is available (since they only serve it fresh). 
Reason 3) It's not a chain. It's actually local! 
Reason 4) The staff is super friendly. Yes, there are days when they get busy and sometimes service is slow those times but that can happen anywhere. They typically go out of their way to make up for that if you give them the chance. 

Our next door neighbors, my hubby and I just went there early this week to celebrate one of their birthdays and my hubby's birthday. They were so excited because they let me do all the ordering. They were surprised because they've been to Doraku a couple times but they said going there with us was like going there for the first time because we ate food they wouldn't usually order and they loved it. The best part is that this little sushi restaurant is only minutes away from our house is always are go to if we are not cooking Blue Apron meals at home."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat for dinner on a Sunday night while out shopping for a new car and had some time to kill. So glad we decided on Sushi Doraku! We ate a little early (about 4:45pm) and there was only two booths that had people in them. We decided to sit at the sushi bar. I had a spicy salmon handroll with cilantro and the sweet shrimp w/heads. My boyfriend had one of their signature rolls (can't remember which one) and everything was GREAT! My brother and his family live close to this restaurant so I let him know how much we enjoyed the food and service so they could also visit. Next time we are on that side of town it's certainly on the top of our list to eat at!"}
{"text":"The sushi here was decent. It's hard to get top quality fish in Arizona, so I realize our sushi restaurants will never be as good as those with ocean access. Even so, the sushi here was lacking a bit in flavor. The standard rolls (Cali, Philly, etc.) were all very good, and exactly what you want. The service was very attentive, and the restaurant was nice and clean. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"The geisha roll was really good it was sweet and spicy. I also ordered the fire garden it was really spicy and came with jalapeños on top of it. The food was good but service was terrible.  The restaurant was about 25% full and I had to flag my waiter down for everything including to remind him I haven't received my appetizer or the miso soup(we received our appetizer after our entrees were finished being eaten). I wouldn't recommend someone to come here for dinner because of the lack in service. Poor service ruins the experience and also ruins. the meal."}
{"text":"Great place!! Sushi is good and they have excellent serves. I've been here 5 or 6 times now and I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We like this place a lot.  All of the important points of a sushi place are here...  Good fresh fish, very good construction, good service, some unique rolls, and a reasonable price.

They have a few house rolls that are fun.  They vary them and post them on a board behind the sushi bar.  Be sure to check that.  My favorite is one with tempura-battered jalapeno and a few other spicy items in a roll with tuna.

Service is always prompt and friendly.

Be sure to ask for the fresh wasabi (costs extra, and well worth it)."}
{"text":"Lunch Tempura Bento box was just perfect. I wanted the veggies and didn't see this originally and Mi-Jung pointed it out.  Thank you, right size and a delicious lunch. Customer service was outstanding and food great.  I will come back."}
{"text":"The sushi is very fresh and very well prepared. The selection is as good as any other sushi place and the service is 2nd to none. Highly recommend this place for all sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Excellent sushi and very good service and happy hour.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try out this place as we were looking for a decent sushi place in this area. It is located in a strip mall and is on the smaller side which makes this place even better to me. I'm a fan of the places that aren't huge and feel more homey. While this place does not beat our favorite sushi places, it is definitely worthwhile to check out. 

The sushi was good tasting and they were good size roles. We got a California roll, Doraku #3 and a Philly Fever. They were all great. When we go back, however, if I get the Philly Fever again, I will get it with crab inside instead of the smoked salmon. I have never been a big fish fan, which is weird bc I loved sushi, so the salmon inside was a little much for me. If i sub the crab inside, it will be perfect. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food for Japanese style, but unacceptably slow service. They had one server working the restaurant during the 6:30pm rush on a Thursday night"}
{"text":"This place was oddly empty at lunchtime. The prices are decent and the sushi rolls are fresh but the menu is pretty generic. Nothing spectacular; just 'ok.'"}
{"text":"Jasmine was sweet and very helpful. The sushi and appetizers were okay, not fantastic but I will return they love Yelp and treat their customers with a lot of respect."}
{"text":"First time being here, they messed up my order and then got upset because I asked for it to be corrected. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and was pretty disappointed. Got a salmon roll, spicy scallop nigiri and a freshwater eel roll. 

The fresh water eel roll was NOT good and tasted rotten so we spoke up and said it was bad.....but the sushi chef (who seemed to be the owner) just argued and said it was good and fresh and there was nothing wrong with it. It was very uncomfortable and although he did take it off our bill, we shouldn't have been made to feel bad about not liking rotten sushi.  

The other two things we got were fine. Nothing special.....but not bad either. 

We were the only ones in the place and we most likely won't be coming back. There are several MUCH better places in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The service is AMAZING!! The food is to die for... the jalapeño poppers are my favorite! The happy hour is so good! we always order a ton of food"}
{"text":"We wanted to dine here several times before reviewing. In short, we really like this place. Freshly prepared rolls, nice selection, reasonable prices and outstanding service. Each meal ends with a complimentary \"dessert\" - just sliced oranges with whipped creme and sweet topping - but a really nice touch!"}
{"text":"I called ahead to place my order and the service over the phone was super friendly. I arrived to pick up and immediately fell in love with the space. The one thing I've learned about sushi restaurants is that when there is too much focus on the decor and \"branding\", the food often becomes an afterthought. Doraku doesn't try too hard and that's a great thing. The interior is quaint and cozy with a beautiful little bar toward the back. It's very much reminiscent of the long standing hole-in-the-wall spots of larger cities. The feeling is warm, inviting and definitely a good place for a date. 

I ordered the Sunset roll which has fresh lemon on top. Doraku removes the rind from the lemon (unlike other places) and I feel it removes all the bitterness. The avocado salad is straight forward and just delicious. 

The only complaint I have is that I live almost an hour away."}
{"text":"Stay away!! My daughter and I ate here yesterday and both have been violently ill --- I'm sure we are experiencing the symptoms of food  poisoning ---food was tasty but not worth the risk!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The sushi is well crafted with creative blends of flavors in the rolls.  I just had Doraku #3 - yummy!  My daughter loves the shrimp tempura roll - her standby at any sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"We arrived around 7:15 and they were not busy. Happy Hour starts at 7:30 so they got busy and only one server did not cut it. She was nice but couldn't keep up with 7 tables, then 8. The sushi chefs (2) couldn't keep up either. Waited almost 45 minutes for our roll. The tuna sushi was not good as it had some kind of gristle in it and I couldn't eat either piece. The chicken katsu was horrible as well, super thin, cold, just didn't taste freshly prepared. Avocado salad would have been really good if it wasn't downed in salad dressing. This is not our first time here but it very well may be our last. Too bad since Japanese is usually my first choice and there's nothing else nearby."}
{"text":"Great tasty sushi! Perfect sushi! Taste so ono!!
Great service! If u want good sushi come check them out!"}
{"text":"Great food good service.  This place is for people who like sushi, not \"Oh I'll have a Calf. roll.\""}
{"text":"We love this little joint!  My family and I eat at this restaurant very frequently.  The food is great and we actually prefer the smaller, more quiet, atmosphere.  We try to visit during Happy Hour as the prices get a bit better.  I've never had a problem with the service, but did recognize that English may be their second language.  I will definitely continue to eat here and highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan as it is more of a true Sushi restaurant vs the other one in the area that is just Trendy Sushi. I have always had great food good service and it's nice that they are close to the house."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 rolls to go. They were: California, Las Vegas, Doraku #3, and the Shrimp Tempura.

The biggest stand out to me was the Doraku #3. The combination of all the ingredients along with the spicy mayo and eel sauce was excellent. I assume those are the in house creations (hence the name). It is nice to see such a delicious roll created by the chefs there.

The California and Shrimp Tempura were pretty standard from what I have had before. I am no sushi expert by any means, but they were good. The Las Vegas was overpowered by the fried outside. Now, it is under the category of \"fried roll,\" so I expected it somewhat. However, I which the flour coating was lighter so I could taste more of the contents inside the roll.

Overall, I was satisfied with the meal and the price of the rolls. Next time I decide to get sushi, I am going to dine-in to check out the vibe in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Very fresh and lots of flavor. Service was good too. I would definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is very small and is a little pricey but they have some of the best sushi.  If you have ever been to Fresh Wasabi you know the sushi is great.  We always get the climax roll & viva Las Vegas rolls which are my favorite.  I usually have my wife order all the rest since I am good with just that roll.  It is a little casual place for lunch and I think they have some specials but I never order them.  Don't come with a big group but its not a bad quick date place since the food is so great."}
{"text":"After my not so nice review earlier this year regarding their price increases, I started going back several months ago and found that the portions of food being served (especially the size of their rolls) had substantially increased.  I'm now visiting them for take out several times a month.  Same delicious food, only more of it.

The staff has always been pleasant and I have had a chance to meet the very accommodating Owner.  They still suffer from rather slow service at times needing another sushi chef when two won't do.  Like many other food service outlets, it's very difficult finding employees...and keeping them.

If you live anywhere near the Lake Peasant/Happy Valley Road intersection and like Japanese food, especially sushi, you owe it to yourself to try this place.  Food is just excellent."}
{"text":"This place is has the best sushi. I love coming here for happy hour and getting appetizers, salad and sushi, on top of that happy hour prices are great. The service is also awesome & the owner is super nice! Definitely try this place out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for a long time and knew fresh wasabi but never ate here when it changed. I have been missing out! They were amazing with my two year old and I will be back very soon. The sushi was good and the put a good portion of fish in the rolls."}
{"text":"Local fav! The sushi is so good and we just discovered the Ramen bowls. Wow! I don't eat them because it's chicken broth. But my boys are in love with them. Tad bit spicy but that's what makes them so amazing. I need to ask if they make a vegetarian broth. Comfortable little place that is always welcoming you in to stay as long as you want."}
{"text":"I've always been hesitant with ordering sushi as take out, but Doraku settled my fears. Not only was the sushi fresh tasting, but the pieces were fairly large and even better, the menu selection was outstanding. They categorize their sushi with speciality, fried, maki and they have their traditional. 

Favorites here are the Tootsie roll, No Name Roll, Unforgettable and Caterpillar. 

They have reverse happy hour where certain rolls and drinks are at reduced prices later in the evening. Dine in only. 

Next time we are in town, we will definitely take advantage."}
{"text":"Today was the final death nail for me at Sushi Doraku.   Since being a customer from Day 1 I have always been happy with the food and the service.  Over the last 12 months both the food quality and service has been downhill.  From fish that is frozen, stale or still with bones in it I have continued to give them the benefit of the doubt due to location.  But after tonight being told that it would take more than 30 minutes for a take out California Roll I'm done.  Unfortunately Doraku has become nothing more than an afterthought for the food or their customers."}
{"text":"Always have loved this place. However I walk in on Thursday at 8:40 and was refused service because we close at 9. Needless to say I won't return."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to go to, until the service went absolutely downhill. The tipping point for me came about a month ago when I waited for fifteen minutes for a waitress to notice me and to take my drink order. There were two waiters working, and only three tables with customers. The two were too busy talking in the corner to notice my party regardless of the amount of times we tried to get their attention, so we brought our business elsewhere. 

Additionally, a time before the tipping point, my girlfriend and I ordered the salmon skin here once, and it came with a citrus-y type of dip which was excellent. When we came back another time, the dip they provided was different. We asked them if they had the lemon dip from the other time to which they rudely replied that \"this is all we do here. You're thinking of somewhere else\". I don't know, maybe it's just me. But that answer really rubbed me the wrong way. Now we do go somewhere else and don't plan on returning. There's better places out there. Just find them."}
{"text":"Vegetable Tempura was crisp and not greasy. $5 for big beers and not happy hour!!!  Great service very friendly and very clean restaurant.  We will be back for sure!  Complimentary dessert is fun as well, nice touch."}
{"text":"All I have to say about this place is FINALLY. I have been combing the entire valley for decent sushi. If you follow me, you'd know I eat a lot of sushi (and tacos). I've liked some places, but have always found something lacking. Today I have FINALLY found the best sushi in the north west valley. The sashimi was fresh, clean, tasty, huge. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and I always want to love a local neighborhood establishment.  Sushi is not an inexpensive meal and there has to be a reasonable balance of freshness and expectation especially when you live in the desert.  I've been to this restaurant a half dozen times trying to find that balance but my conclusion is its just not there.  I've had nearly every menu item and sampled different times and days.  However quality and service have just been on a downward spiral.  So my final visit last week was my last.  Bones in my Hamachi...really?  Wasabi so cut down that a spoonful wouldn't have even been enough to bring even a mild heat. Teriyaki so overcooked as to call into question whether the kitchen cared at all what was being served.  So while I've made excuses over time for short staffing, new chefs and nods to a local business,  I painfully waited 15 minutes to pay my 80 dollar bill for the last time.  I'll spend a few more minutes and drive to Tokyo Lobby on Bell and 59th where I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"We attempted to visit this restaurant on a Sunday evening. They only had one waitress on staff. She told us that they didn't have room to seat a party of 6. There were a ton of available booths and a bar with more than 6 seats so we sat down. After 10 minutes she hadn't brought us menus. We got up and left and will not be back. There is a great sushi restaurant across the street called Squid Ink- go there instead and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you post you are open until 9pm then why would you turn down a party of three at 8:40 on a Thursday night? I can understand closing a bit early on a dead night but there was two other tables with customers. Make up your mind do you want to be in business or not. Here is another suggestion! Don't leave your front door wide open if you need to close early. Mindless!"}
{"text":"I got the veggie udon bowl for happy hour, and it is so delicious! The prices were very reasonable and the sushi is good too! They have a pretty big menu with a lot of really interesting specialty rolls!"}
{"text":"The food is always really good, but we feel it is overpriced.  To be fair, we come from Hawaii where Japanese food is on every corner so the restaurants have to be competitive or no one will eat at yours. For the two of us, with no drinks, we end up spending upwards of $50 and that does not include the tip. The service is pretty good, the actual restaurant is cute. Just wish it wasn't so expensive. :)"}
{"text":"Always good sushi here. One of my favorite in the area for both creative sushi rolls and nigiri."}
{"text":"First and last time here.. problem 1... your paying double for every sushi roll ...over priced for the size of sushi..I payed 13 $  for the sushi roll in my pic .. I try different sushi places every week so I know my sushi and I know good sushi ...problem 2...sushi is nothing special here for the price it's OK but I left hungry and not happy..sushi rated..3.5 out of 10 .....PEOPLE who say this sushi is bomb I'll tell you now they don't know good sushi .it's OK not bomb....problem 3...horrible service.1 lady for the whole little restaurant not a good call ..i know this place is small but at one time every table needed something and she couldn't do it alone the sushi chef had to help her so please hired someone and stop being cheap ...like your sushi roll 6 pieces for 13$ is robbery ..and they tasted like the sushi I could of got at frys. ..taste ok not great...F.Y.I if your gonna get sushi in this area and you want good sushi I recommend  squid ink ...you'll pay 13 to 15 $ a roll but the sushi is way better and more pieces and they close right across the way from this place ..."}
{"text":"Friend referred us to this restaurant and it has the most amazing sushi I've tasted in the Phoenix Metro Area! Highly recommend the Salmon Mango roll, the cream sauce on this was light and full of flavor paired with the Pleasant Bomber - warm sake and Japanese beer... Excellent combination! Not to mention, excellent service from the staff... We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here. We love this place. Unfortunately we came in on a Friday evening at about 7:30. The place was busy but there was one 4 person high top available and nobody was waiting. We were told that since it was only two of us we could sit at the bar or air outside in the 60 degree weather but not at the high top.My husband and I are both 6ft tall and sitting at the bar was not an option and I get cold easily. We left and I don't know if or when we will return. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"good sushi but it's over price to expensive I order fire roll just to try taste  good but I am sorry too small to expensive"}
{"text":"You know.. I don't normally complain about sushi as it is one of my favorite types of food. But this place.. Holy Shit.. 

Service- fucking trash
Sushi- fucking dirt trash
Billing as expected- im done..

This place is small and they didn't have a lot of people when I came in. When we got sat down we were given 2 menus for 5 ppl to share.. like.. you dumb? Took them like 15 minutes before they came and took our order thats a big nono.. I'm here like a starvin marvin and they have the audacity to come back to check on their guests 15 minutes later?!?? My god..

I ordered the byaku #7 or whatever bull shit, the volcano roll, and the enhanced las vegas roll. Sorry i didnt take pictures cause it was so ugly I didn't want to break my camera. The #7 had hardly any fish in it and its wrapped with the longest string of cucumber.. the volcano roll looks like glazed orange yam wrapped with seaweed. TRASH. The enhanced vegas roll tasted better of the three but it was cold... like da fuck? 

Billing.. ask for my check and it took them another 15 minutes to retrieve it. Then they go and fuck my my bill by adding beer when I clearly did not order it. They had to do voids and what not and that took another 15 minutes.. I was there for 2 hours but realistically only ate for 15 minutes as the remainder of the time i was waiting..  jesus christ. 

Side note: their chef is running around filling water, taking away empty plates, going in and out of the restaurant, and cashiering.. what the fuck are you doing?? I have never seen this organization before. This is a crime for sushi chef to be out doing that stuff at a sushi restaurant. You need to get back there and start cranking out food. This is probably why the food is so bad. 

Final thoughts? I rather eat the Mediterranean food next door. This place was rated $$ Thats a understatement..  $$$"}
{"text":"I came for lunch today, and I had a craving for Tuna Tataki. The tuna was almost cooked through, and tasted like smoke. Awful. There was loud jazz music playing, and someone in the back kitchen was banging on something incessantly. I finally got it to go, couldn't take the noise anymore. I then picked apart the salad. So, I paid $20 for a bowl of lettuce. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good sushi. After living in Japan for 4 years my hubby and I have a tendency to end up at sushi or Japanese restaurants for date night. We are new to the Peoria area and decided to give this place a try. We were there on a Friday Night about 5pm and were able to get seated and our food pretty quick. The place had a decent crowd, but nothing staggering. The sushi was good. We split the Smoked Salmon, California Roll, Caterpillar Roll, Booty Booty Roll, and Gyoza. It was good and filling. Price was decent it was about $50 for all we got. The food came out as soon as it was ready and was fresh. We will probably be back to try out some ramen and curry."}
{"text":"Very good sushi menu and excellent quality food. Great service. Wine list is very limited (one white house, one red house etc) and could be better but beer selection is good (Asian and domestic). Will definitely be back.

If you do decide to do a better wine list, please include an oakey Chardonnay like Sonoma Cutrer!"}
{"text":"Been to several amazing sushi joints throughout the valley. This one is basic and average. We ordered crab, ramen, a few sushi rolls and several appetizers. Food just didn't stand out. It wasn't terrible food but none of it was great, either."}
{"text":"If you have never visited this gem of a place you need to! Great local sushi and I've tried quite a few places!!! Amazing staff. Amazing food! Great prices. A must if you love sushi! 

The happy hour prices are decent! The sake bombs.. well they speak for themselves! 

This is my favorite place!"}
{"text":"Have lived near this place for years and recently checked it out. Sushi was probably the worst sushi we've ever had. Not worth it, at all."}
{"text":"Had high expectations given the reviews. Oh well. Food was ok, not great but just ok. Service on the other hand was terrible. We ordered miso soup and edamame along with our sushi order. The sushi came and never got the soup and the edamame came when we were finished and ready to leave. The edamame was over cooked and tasteless.

No one came over to see if everything was fine. We were ignored. We'll I'll be ignoring them from now on and will try other places."}
