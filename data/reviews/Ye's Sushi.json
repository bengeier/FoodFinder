{"text":"First time visiting this place. The only good thing about it was the decor and overall feeling. Large and spacious with a nice ambience to it. But it stops there. Salad bar is a joke. Dressings look like they have been there for weeks. The service is God awful. You ask for cutlery and they dump it all on one's lap basically for you to pass around to your party. Then you order using their dirty ipads. The food arrives out of order from when you ordered it and some dishes never show. They take a very long time to show up and the place wasn't even busy. The best part is they dump all the food at one end of the table for you to grab and bring over to where your sitting and to pass around to your guests. You can't even tell who ordered what bc they just dump it in one spot. The sushi rolls fall apart and the quality is garbage. The dessert looks like it came from a frozen package and your refills on drinks...well let's just say you better nurse that one and only as they never come around to ask if you need more. Overall take your money elsewhere. The sex shop next door would probably serve you better over this place. Go to KB Sushi. Winston Churchill and QEW in the theatre Plaza. That place has the best Sushi and service in town, using the same iPad idea."}
{"text":"good taste, service is ok and free drink is attracting. good taste, service is ok and free drink is attracting. good taste, service is ok and free drink is attracting."}
{"text":"A well deserved one star to say the least.  They closed at 10pm and we walked at 8.55pm, we were quicky sat and told right off the bat last call for food was 930pm. Once seated we ordered as fast as we could multiple times on the iPad and began to eat, now there were no issues with the food but the service not only was it unprofessional but disgraceful to the rest of the food service world. I placed my food order well before last call but still did not receive everything ordered when I asked a server I was brushed off all he said was \"yah it's coming if tour still hungry\", out of 5 missing items 2 came but not the quantity we ordered. I asked a server for cutlery and she scoffed at me rolled her eyes and left. Fine I asked someone else, he was cleaning a used table and handed me a fork (there were 2 of us) now was it too much for me to Burdon them for FRESH   utensils. As a matter of fact my entire experience here made it seem like I was Burdoning the staff with my patronage. I am an avid diner and this is the first time I have ever felt this was, hence the review."}
{"text":"I love the pressed sushi. If u come for dinner, thats a must try!
Tuesday speical is a great deal for dinner"}
{"text":"Like all others, myself and 3 other friends decided to try Ye's Sushi for dinner on a Tuesday based on recommendations from other friends. I agree the decor is great and the salad bar was good as it included things like crab legs and mussels. The dessert area was good for its soft serve ice cream. However, all your usual desserts that you can get at any all-you-can eat sushi place where it would be served it to you, was also available. I guess maybe it's not a bad idea to go and walk up for my dessert after eating so much food (which by the way you will feel like your forced to eat). I comment on this below.

The sushi and food itself is nothing out of the ordinary and I found not to be as good as some other places I've tried.

I would also like to warn you that should you leave at least one ounce of food on you plate, you will likely be charged for this. God forbid I leave just one last salmon roll that my poor stomach couldn't handle.

They made us feel quite uncomfortable when they saw that we had left quite a bit of pad thai on the table. The pad thai was sour and there was no way anyone was going to force us to eat that. The waiter was rude and told us that he would get his Manger when we complained about the food. The manager never came. The waiter then told us that the manager had walked by our table several times looking at our plates. And trust me, that was clearly noticed as the manager AND the waiter hovered around us like vultures making sure we were eating EVERYTHING! Super awkward! We asked the waiter what their process was with guests that don't eat all their food, and he laughed and replied \"I don't know.\"  

The waiter then told us that they will not charge us for the extra food \"this time\" as if we should be grateful that they didn't force us to eat their sour pad thai and last salmon roll. No one should have to eat that!

Overall, not pleased with the food (same old, same old, and not even that great) and we definitely did not appreciate the service. 

I'm giving this place 2 stars (which I think is being nice) simply because of the crab legs, mussels and soft serve ice cream. 

I will not be returning to this place and would recommend others to stay away."}
{"text":"We went this past Sunday at 12 PM, it was not busy. The meat dishes we ordered all came out cold. We then ordered, Broccoli Beef, that was disgusting, had the meat been velveted? Told them to take it back. We ordered some dim sum, that was overcooked and rubbery. So, we thought we would start again and ordered 6 dishes, the manager came over and told use that we ordered too much at an AYCE restaurant, for 3 adults !! The sushi was edible but seemed to lack something. Yes Sushi is definitely a No Sushi for us."}
{"text":"Always my best choice for family party. Many dishes and good taste. Especially roll's and mutton I didn't see at other buffers."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Mississauga! Service and atmosphere is always great. The fire grilled options are my favourite and keep us coming back. Dessert options are one of the best I've seen with fresh fruit, jellos, creme brûlée, several ice cream options. I've brought several friends and family here and they've all loved it as well. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"When I first game here over a year ago the food was delicious. It became a favourite of mine until recently. In the past few months I've noticed that the food quality was getting worse and worse. A week or so ago my mom and I decided to go there to have supper after we weren't able to find a parking spot at Mandarin which is across the street from it. That visit turned out to be our last. The food while edible certainly wasn't the quality it once had been. The seaweed salad which is one of my favourites tasted fishy and off. The teriayke beef didn't taste at all like it was supposed to and the meet was shoe leather and grizzle. We both felt sick after eating there and while the staff are very friendly we will not be back. Sorry guys but the food is not worth what they charge."}
{"text":"It was a very nice time to spend in this wonderful restaurant and I really want to be in this restaurant again and taste all those food again"}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi I've been to so far. Nice clean place, there is an Ipad menu that is very comfortable for the technologically inept (like me), salad bar, dessert bar with self soft serve ice cream for the kiddies, great selection, yummy food. Sushi is the one food all my kids agree on despite the age and this place does not disappoint.  Good salmon sashimi too."}
{"text":"First off I don't know why everyone else is saying this place is 2 stars and just commenting on how the seaweed salad or udon noodles are mediocre. The sushi to me, tasted wonderful. It's the best fresh tasting sushi I've had so far for an AYCE. I've been to other AYCE all around Mississauga but YE's sushi is by far the best so far. Seaweed salami and udon noodles are okay, but what do you expect for an ayce sushi? What's important is the sushi itself and that's beyond wonderful. THey also serve sweet shrimp when he you don't normally get at other ayce places so that is a bonus. The interior decor is modern and nice, it's an IPAD menu ordering system which is great. Service is quick and prompt and the staff were attentive. You even get wet wipes at the start of your meal to clean your hands before eating which was unexpected. I've been here twice and I would continue to go again. If you go on a Tuesday, there is a discount promo which helps save you a few extra bucks!"}
{"text":"Went there for an a la Carte dinner and it was fabulous. Sushi was phenomenal. Went back for an all you can eat and was not up to the same quality. Was pretty annoyed. The facility is top notch. Great artechitecture lots to look at. They did not have a liquor lisc when I went so can't comment."}
{"text":"I'm really not picky when it comes to food. What I ask for is fresh/ close to fresh food and I'm fairly satisfied even if the flavour is a bit odd. I'll give as objective an answer as I can.
Environment was good. I went with my wife on a Tuesday night for dinner so not many people (Tuesday night is extra cheap for dinner. Though not by that much).
I enjoyed browsing the salad bar, along with shrimp, mussels and crabs (very similar to what you see in Mandarin, which is actually right across the street from this place), dessert, a lot of ice cream hard and soft (Wife's favourite)
The salad and seafood were not that fresh. Shrimp was a little soggy. Mussels were okay but the crabs were dry.
The selection's bigger than 168 and moon sushi. I typically like ordering the stuff that I have not tried so I was fairly surprised that there's quite a variety aside from the other AYCE.
Food came pretty fast. However the fried stuff, oh the fried stuff.... A lot of the fried stuff were not fresh. 100% re-fried. You can tell from the extra oily smell, the extra brown breading, the calamari was completely shriveled up and as hard as rubber, just shrunk up inside a huge fairly hollow casing of the brown breading. Some were okay like the tempura but I guess those get ordered more frequently as well.
The sashimi and everything else were okay. Ice cream was good (the hard were a little too hard). Nothing else to really say.
I wouldn't want to come back though unless I'm here for AYCE sushi + AYCE mussels and shrimps."}
{"text":"Will never come again! 

The sauce they use is Kikkoman. Can you image they put salt into the soy sauce? The reason they did that, everybody can see the purpose. The fish is not taste like fresh fish, so disappointed, will never come again."}
{"text":"Everything was ok the decoration staff and service but the food is terrible. Me and my husband we both got sick after eating their food. We couldn't eat much even though e got all you can eat special because we felt dizzy and nausea.  I don't know why maybe it was dirty or something but definitely it is not a good place to eat"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and there are a lot of options for anyone to eat! If you're vegetarian there are a few options however my friend wasn't happy with them. The price is good and I believe that I got quality food for what I paid for. The waiters are friendly and even if they're not serving any waiter will help you which is great when you have a table full of food with more coming on the way and you need someone to take empty plates. 

I recommend this place if you like sushi, Thai food, Ramen and more!"}
{"text":"Ye's Is A No's!!! 

This is the worst Sushi Place in Ontario never mind Oakville. I only gave it a one star because I couldn't give it a no star! If you love crappy food, crabby servers & non existent service you'll love Ye's .... excuse me because I have to run to the bathroom ..... that's how bad the food is here. 

Note ..... I'm not trying to be malicious but this place really sucks & why at 7pm on a Sat it's half empty!"}
{"text":"Good food although they've reduced their menu items for AYCE which kinda sucked.  Their torched stuff is good but rice heavy.  I like their creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Hey, the place had a great atmosphere and better selection of sashimi than Heart Sushi. I'd like to say that the shrimp tempura was really good, but some of the servings were relatively smaller than expected or overpowered with too much sauce. 

The presentation overall of each dish were amazing but as you continue to order each item, they seem to taste to similar to one another, not really having a distinct taste to itself. I believe it was the orders of grilled dishes and the maki rolls to which I meant. They did had a variety of cuisine not locked to Japanese such as Chinese, Thai, and Korean.

I'm glad at the variety of desserts they have to offer with the choice of black sesame, green tea, red bean, and ginger ice cream, but I also noticed that these ice cream taste lighter than the ones you can purchase from the supermarket.

All orders can be placed using the ipad."}
{"text":"TLDR: if you don't want to honor coupons, then don't put them out.

Some friends went the other night and said it was good.  Gave us a $6 off coupon they used. When we went to pay and gave the coupon, our server was \"oh sure let me go apply it\", but the minute he mention it to the manager, the manager was visibly upset.  Started just spewing excuses as to why it couldn't be used and ended up with \"you have to print it out\". Really??  In 2015, and with a web coupon your store put out, one of the stipulations to claim it is you have to print it out prior to going? ! 

When my wife pointed out that wasn't written anywhere, he seemed to have given in and looked at the coupon but noticed it was expired and says \"it's expired\". My wife opened the wrong one and while she's trying to find the current one, he repeats it's expired and runs off.

After a few moments we find the current coupon, give it to the server and he goes off to find manager guy again only to return and say now it can't be used because it wasn't printed. He was so embarrassed and apologetic because everyone knew the manager was grasping at excuses to be a sleaze about it.  I was going to just take it out of the tip but that wouldn't have been fair to a good server.  I just hope sleaze manager didn't pocket the tip instead.

All I can say is for $6 on a $100 bill they lost everyone at the table as customers and probably everyone we know.   

The food was ok. Not amazing by any means but not terrible either. 4-5/10"}
{"text":"Was a little worried at first since looking at previous reviews, but for an all you can eat sushi place, everything was done really well I think, they don't make your sushi with a crap load of rice like some other places.  And their flame torched sushi thing that I forgot was awesome, definitely much better than most other all you can eat sushi places in Toronto or Mississauga.  I can only think of one or two other places just as good or better but are much further away.  The ambience is awesome there and the desert bad is wicked, even has creme brûlée.  Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Rice was just mushy and vinegary. Fish tastes like it was dethawed. Deep fried stuff was okay, but we didn't really come to a Japanese all you can eat for that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. Salmon sashimi is one of my favourite things about sushi, and they definitely get it right. They don't have any salmon avocado Maki rolls (another favourite) available on the menu, but when I asked, they were able to custom make it. There are a lot of options but the menu is listed somewhat randomly--similar categories aren't grouped, but isn't really that big of an issue. The salad bar and dessert bar are definitely something unique and the iPad menu has more variety in Asian style dishes (thai, curry, etc). They also updated the iPad menu so that you can order the food yourself instead of having the server come by every time.

Our main server, Eagle, was extremely nice and helpful. We had a lot of weird requests, but he was always able to accommodate them and was friendly the entire time, despite us asking so often."}
{"text":"Someone from the food inspection industry should check this place out.  

Horrible dinning experience....  to bad because it's a nice place and I have been there before and recommended to many others.  A little on the pricey side BUT that's not the issue.  So we were there tonight (wife, 3 year old, 7 year old and myself) for dinner....already charging more for a weekend rate.  We sit down, order and my wife grabs some salad... to start.  She comes back to the table and she is about to eat a Cherry Tomato only to see that it is 3/4 covered in green/blue/furry mold.  She was completely turned off (her first time their) and didn't want to try anything we ordered.  I convinced her to try a chicken skewer that we got for the kids.  She bit into it and it was chewy and hardly cooked.  Suffice to say she didn't want to eat OR try anything else and she actually left she was so disgusted.  The waiter came by and I showed him the Mold...he apologized which was nice (expected but nice).  Shortly thereafter the manager came by and said sorry.  I told him my wife really didn't feel like eating anything after seeing how bad that was (remember she has also left now) and he proceeded to tell me that he apologizes and that they are very busy and that the tomatoes were from Costco and he will take 10% off our bill.  LOL LOL  What restaurant would do this... especially a buffet whereas she hardly ate anything because she was turned off by the disgusting food she almost ingested.  Am I supposed to be thankful now.  It's not like she ordered some prepared meal... it takes nothing for them to say...don't worry, we are terribly sorry, no charge for her.  It's not like we wasted anything either.  So instead.... I got the $85 bill for 1 adult and two kids that ate steamed rice and uncooked chicken (kicker to all of this.... they are all in a washroom right now at home) glad I stuck to the sushi.  They need to get their Customer Service worked out and moreover just plain old fashion courtesy.  Do what's right, handle things properly AND stop the CASH grab.  It's not like they are running a cheap dinner whereas they need to count every penny.  Awful move Ye's....  shameful.  Someone from the food inspection agency should check this place out OR Canada Revenue (save % if you pay cash)   Hmmm  thinking I will avoid this place for a while and see what happens."}
{"text":"SUSHI LOVERS BEWARE.

Let me start off by saying this place doesn't deserve any stars, though I actually would've been fair with a 2 star rating until my boyfriend and I contracted food poisoning shortly after eating here. I usually take restaurant reviews with a grain of salt, though I regret not seeking out the opinions of this place before dining, since I can attest to what many others have said. 

After frequenting many other sushi joints in nearby areas (Prince, 168, Moon, etc) we were excited to try this place out, seeing as they were somewhat new to the area. We were unfortunately loured in and fooled by the swanky interior/exterior, which look quite stellar and modern - their food quality, unfortunately, is not parallel with their outward appearance, to say the least. It's evident where their earnings are invested.

We arrived for an early dinner, around 4:30pm. Greeted and seated promptly, and surprised by the delivery of an iPad menu - a nice gimmicky touch, which I've enjoyed the use of at other restaurants. Plenty of buffet options, though we found the organization of items and lack of food descriptions very confusing and off-putting, which ultimately led us to order less food than our usual sushi outings. 

THANK GOODNESS we ordered less!!! Not saying I'm a sushi connoisseur or anything, but you know the sushi's bad when the rolls are falling apart and everything is either bland or extremely tasteless - even the WASABI (gritty and no spice whatsoever!!) The hot dishes were severely overcooked as well, with the meat being very chewy and tough. Service was quick and attentive, but all the food delivered was overwhelmingly underwhelming. The regret was real after the first few bites. 

Last note - what AYCE sushi restaurant has a walk-up salad and dessert bar? Found this quite bizarre, considering you had to retrieve your ginger from there as well, which they declined to bring to your table with the \"wasabi\" (again, strange). Items looked sketchy at best - random small selection of fruits and some questionable looking shrimp sitting in ice. Not impressed. The desserts were unappetizing as well - Japanese cuisine with soft serve ice cream?? More like melting as soon as it touched the dish. Just seemed inappropriate. 

Needless to say, I will never be returning and will discourage anyone from dining at this \"establishment\" EVER. From my sushi experience, I have never encountered issues to this degree, let alone food poisoning. Back to my sushi faves!!"}
{"text":"What a horrible horrible service. They are not attentive at all. Young people who do not know how to properly serve the customer. Food is good and nice selection buy because of the service, I'm not going back. Too bad."}
{"text":"I tried Ye's when it first opened. I loved the interior design; however, the taste of some of the food was off putting. The desert section was terrific. I liked the soft ice cream machine with a choice of syrups. My soft mango ice cream with white chocolate sauce was a treat. It was also  nice to see cheesecake in the desert section. Unfortunately, I do not go to Japanese restaurants for the desert. For now, I will continue to use 168 which is a short distance away."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. The sashimi and rolls where awful. The food was brought out one single item at a time. The appetizers where interesting and a quite a selection. However not enough for me to come here. Never again. Drive a little further for something better."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times but today was quite disappointing to say the least. 

-quality of the food was lacking. Items that are supposed to be hot were warm or room temperature. The fried tentacles were slightly soggy, not crispy.
- One item never came and when we asked about it, we never got an update, we just never got it
- some items took long to arrive. I ordered har gow (shrimp dumpling), it took at least 10 minutes and when I got it, it wasn't even hot. 
- our server wasn't enthusiastic or really cared about serving us. When we told her about the missing item she just said \"ok\" and walked away. 
- we ordered deep fried banana and deep fried milk pudding....it took 15 minutes...we were still finishing up some food so at least we weren't waiting with absolutely no food. When we got it, the banana was good but the milk pudding wasn't. I found it to be dry and I usually love that dessert  what a bummer!!!"}
{"text":"fantastic service! got seated right away and I love the idea of AYCE and the self serve desert. the food came out quickly and it was super delicious I loved my experience here. 

the interior design is really cool too. I like how it's decorated but it was a little too dark.. almost unwelcomly dark when I walked in. but it wasn't that big of a deal.

great for group dinners, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. A definite contender for best sushi in Mississauga. Their fire hand pressed sushi is certainly one that will keep u coming back for more. Service was also excellent. Overall a wonderful sushi experience."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere AND food! They have a great selection of food at lunchtime, all at an affordable price. I was quite pleased that they offered a build your own salad bar that also had fresh fruits, and ice creams! My only complaint would be they rice to fish ratio in their sushi is off; a little too much rice for my own liking. Otherwise, delicious! Would highly recommend the steamed pork dumplings (shao mai). They were moist and flavourful! I also couldn't get over the huge dessert selection! Unlike most AYCE sushi places where you're torn between the *difficult* decision between mango or green tea ice cream, Ye's offers cheesecakes, creme brûlée, pastries, egg tarts... the list goes on! I needed a second stomach for that! Definitely not my last visit!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I love the fried rice and sushi, and also the ice cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost. Nothing is fresh. They pre made their rolls and so the rice is really hard especially the spicy salmon roll. The shrimp tempura within the roll is soggy and you know it's been pre made."}
{"text":"The environment is nice and on the quieter side. I personally think here is more expensive on the value provided. The all you can eat options are not that many and the varieties are less than other places."}
{"text":"It's worth to go this sushi restaurant. We used to go to 168, but found its a bit too small and noisy. This place is huge and food is tasty as well."}
{"text":"It's a good place for sushi or buffet lover. I like their decor and IPad ordering system. Service is fast,food is fresh, quality is better than Mandarine, my opinion only.
Anyway, I tried their sashimi and grilled beef etc, not too special,but to be honest, above average. 
May come back."}
{"text":"I want to be very specific why I have given this AYCE restaurant only 2 stars.
 
When my wife and I walked into Ye's Sushi, our first sight was the bar showcasing several bottles of liquor displayed on plexiglass shelves. Turning left, we were very impressed how large the restaurant is. Immediately we took notice of the asian modern décor: Large, red illuminated circles dividing each of the tables in the centre row. Incandescent light fixtures resembled lanterns suspended at the top of both side walls painted red which gave the place a darker ambiance feel.
 
After we were seated, we were told how their restaurant works: Ipad ordering system and if we wanted salads or desserts then we just need to walk to the back of the restaurant. After we made our choices, we decided to check out their appetizers and plan our desserts. We were equally impressed with both the salad bar and dessert station.
 
We brought back our salads and found that some of our food had already arrived. Presentation-wise the food looked appetizing. All the salmon and white tuna sushi all lined up neatly on a stone marble serving tray. But as soon as I picked up a salmon sushi, it completely fell apart on me. I thought nothing of it and tried to pick up another. Again, another fell apart. Then my wife noticed that her sushi started to fall apart on her too. We also decided to try one piece each of the Fire Grilled Salmon Sushi and Fire Grilled With Tuna Sushi. Again, they both fell apart! The experience of having to pick up small morsels of sushi rice with our chopsticks completely overshadowed our appetites. On top of this, combine the sour hollandaise dressing with the dry texture of the grilled salmon and tuna sushi was sort of a recipe for disaster. 

Their spicy salmon rolls were not spicy at all. It did not have the taste of what you would expect from the usual spicy salmon roll. I ordered their TYK soup which I think was their Tom Yum soup. Do not order this as it is just a terrible tasting broth with uncooked veggies. Not worthy of taking up my camera space.
 
The only good part of the meal was their Crème Brulee and soft serve mango ice cream. Flavour and consistency was just right. It was good enough that I asked my wife to grab me another.
 
I have to say that our dining experience here was just awful but their service and salad/dessert stations are what really saved Ye's Sushi from a 1 star review. We will not be coming back here anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  Had an ok lunch today.   Ok service, ok food.   After I paid the bill i realized they charged a premium charge.   When I questioned the hostess she giggled and said Valentines Day holiday charge.  I was surprised, I
Said it's not a holiday, she giggled again.  I work at a company nearby and we will not be back, 200+ employees.   At minimum, a restaurant should have to disclose an up charge for a calendar date.  Valentines is not a holiday last I checked, especially over lunch with coworkers."}
{"text":"Been there so many times. But last time we went, husband and toddler got food poisoning. Had diarrhea right after we came out. Would try it again. That might be a one time incident. Service is good. Food comes relatively fast.

The dessert needs to be improved. Waffles are hard. Egg tarts and cream brulee doesn't taast very good. Cream puffs were hard as well. Dessert bar needs improvement."}
{"text":"This place is a very hit and miss kind of place. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not. One time we came and the sashimi tasted AWFUL. And then another time we came (birthday party) and the sashimi was really good. I don't know what's going on, but it's not consistent. The service is ok but slow on refills for drinks.."}
{"text":"I love trying new sushi joints, and this happened to be a big one that opened close to home!

The exterior and interior are superb - probably the best from any sushi restaurant I've ever been to. However, the service was terrible. 

First of all, they ask you to specify if you have allergies - which I did (shellfish). So we asked the waitress to put the shrimp dishes in a separate plate.... and after a minute of going back and forth trying to explain this to her, we gave up. Maybe they should train their staff a bit more on dealing with allergies? That could go a long way, especially since they specifically ask to list your allergies.

Anyways, that aside, once we ordered our food on the iPad, it took over 30 minutes at times for the waitress to come to our table. This was unacceptable because it wasn't even busy! There were maybe 3 other groups there, and over 90% of the restaurant was empty! They did have a lot of workers, but when we got up to look for them, we saw about 10 of them eating at a table... should you make sure the customers are fed first?

The dessert was also a mess, since they forced us to get it before are final round of dishes came out - because they made us wait 30 minutes to come by and take our final order.

I was very unimpressed with Ye's, and will not be back. We went on a Tuesday evening when it was quiet... Imagine how much worse it would be when it is busy!"}
{"text":"Tried this sushi joint that opened up recently as its close to home. Went for the all you can eat lunch and was sorely disappointed with the quality of food coming to the table. The soup broths were awful tasting, the sushi rolls had minimal fish and even the quality of fish was disappointing. The prep and presentation of the food wasn't great either. I wouldn't return, ever."}
{"text":"This AYCE sushi restaurant was a big disappointment. 

Pros: The decor and self-serve salad and dessert bar are fantastic. They have a large selection of items and the sushi rolls are good. My favourite dessert, green tea icecream was good.

Cons: The soy sauce was SO SALTY. It was the Kikkoman brand that other sushi joints have but it definitely tasted different. I asked for the low sodium soy sauce (the green bottle) and even that was extremely salty. This put a damper on our entire meal because we were mostly there for sashimi and sushi. There were many dishes we tried that were not very good including kimchi beef ramen, squid balls, and beef udon noodles. The dim sum tasted like plastic. It was served in a plastic dish, unlike other places where dim sum is served in a wooden dish. Regarding dessert, the chocolate soft serve and Mango mousse were not great.

I tried Ye's out of curiosity but I am definitely going to stick to 168 Sushi or Heart Sushi for AYCE."}
{"text":"Its nice, good environment!!!!!! Better 168 i think! Quiet i like!! Clean! Good music"}
{"text":"Updated review:

Bumped my rating to a 5! Check out the dinner menu changes which include beef tataki and salmon tataki  (imagine lightly seared and seasoned sashimi), salmon salad, and seafood sunomono, saba roe sashimi, red tuna sashimi, just to name a few.

Previous review:

Enjoyed a Saturday lunch here. Our second time here as a group of 10 (including 4 kids).  We opted for the lunch menu (e.g., no sashimi) but the dinner menu is available all day if you want more selection.

I like the self-serve salad bar. My personal favs are the mango salad, crab salad, and mussels (appears to have replaced the peeled shrimp). Ditto for the self-serve dessert bar. For example, you have a choice between soft-serve and scooped ice cream. My only nitpick was the so-called egg tart.

Ordered our dishes via iPad. The number in parentheses tells you how many pieces per order. Simply tap to add and later confirm. Food was very good. No disappointments here.

Service was friendly and prompt. It did get slower as the restaurant got busier, but that is to be expected. We got everything we ordered (more or less) -- the iPad doesn't indicate what's been delivered vs queued. In any case, we left satisfied with that can't-eats-no-more feeling."}
{"text":"What's not to like, the place is cozy it has a good ambience spacious and clean. The staff are friendly and the food is good and they also have a salad and dessert bar an added bonus."}
{"text":"I Have gone to the Ye's chain in Waterloo and was noT impressed with the sushi there but was willing to give this location (whether associated or not) a try as it had just opened and may win me over. As I was down the street on my way there, I called to ask when last call was as it was 915 already and I know last call usually is 930 at most AYCE sushi restaurants. They said if I got there before 930 it was fine. 2 minutes later as I was pulling in they called me back saying even if I knew what I wanted (I know my order by heart as it is the same at all AYCE restaurants) I was not allowed to order from the AYCE menu, but if I wanted a la carte they can make food for me then. I reiterated it was before last call and they said it doesn't matter. How is it OK to order from one menu and not the other when it still is before their designated \"last call\". I didn't even make it through the door and they already turned me away with bad service during their stated running hours. I now will not go here or even try to go here ever again."}
{"text":"To start off, the decor looks great and the ambiance is nice. Just from that, we expected some solid Japanese food - unfortunately that did not happen. 

By reading these reviews you probably know there's a salad and dessert bar at the back of the restaurant. Our waitress failed to mention this and we only found out when going to the washroom near the end of our meal (we were seated near the entrance) 

The selection at lunch was fairly limited, service ridiculously slow for AYCE (we got our taro chips 30 minutes into the meal), sushi rice was FALLING APART, and our torched sushi was way overcooked. 

Regardless, their fish tasted fresh and some of their bizarre maki rolls were tasty. Definitely not planning on coming back, but not the worst place to go if you're really craving sushi."}
{"text":"Popped in here last night for dinner. The dining room is full of clean spacious booths. Ordering by tablet was easy and relatively quick. The portions are small, so order many each time. I ate mostly sushi/Japanese, but there was only 5 types of fish. They seemed fresh enough. The grilled mackerel was fishy, so not so fresh :( Overall, the quality and taste was okay at best. 
At almost $30 per adult, it's expensive when you are forcing yourself to eat mediocre food just to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"My friends n i tried this new restaurant for the first time.. My friend told me that the place look like the restaurant in macau. The music was up to date and the food was great. I love the desserts that they have. We didnt had a chance to try all of them because we're so full already..

The green tea, red bean and the chocolate ice cream is to die for! Btw, they have ice cream machine with more than one flavours.. I only tried the chocolate with chocolate syrup.. They had four different flavour of syrups also.. 

Oh the salad bar is one of the highlite for me. I tried crab, seaweeds and Mango salad. The mango salad was the best.. One of my fave
 
The service was fast too. No waiting. So thats one part that i like.. The food servings was great. Just enough for individual.. Our experienced eating in this restaurant was awesome..  I guess this will b added to my fave place to eat.. 

Price: its a bit pricey than other sushi restaurant.. But its ok for us because we had a good experience and good food. 
Im sure my friends n i will definitely coming back in the future.."}
{"text":"Finally opened!!

They did a great job with decor.   They put in spacious tables as if to provide you with room to expand as you eat.  Nice decor and darkly lit as if I'm in a trendy nightclub with hip music to boot.

Typical order from an iPad deal.  A scrawny selection of Chinese and Thai that won't satisfy your craving.  \"The rolls stand out as the best items on the menu as well as the sushi and sashimi.   The photos of fried rice look alarmingly like the same bowl of fried rice with slabs of chicken or beef on top that make it chicken vs beef fried rice.  The Shrimp dumplings were ok.  They also have a serve yourself salad bar and dessert bar.  Salad bar has greens to let you make your own Caesar salad, plus ready made seaweed salad, kimchi, crab salad, Cold peel and eat shrimp and mussels in shells as well as jello and chunks of fresh fruit.  Tempura was freshly made but greasy.  Sesame balls were good. Ho fun noodles were greasy, salty, and didn't resemble the picture at all.  

Dessert is also help yourself. They have a soft serve machine as well as green tea, ginger, red bean, and black sesame ice cream along with a selection of lacklustre desserts.  Fried milk was a greasy ball of deep fried custard which was heavy and not appetizing.  Stick to the ice cream and fruit at the salad bar.

Service is pretty quick and friendly.  At $25 pp on a Monday night it's not bad for what you get..."}
{"text":"worst ayce experience?food is not fresh and not well- prepared? will not coming back for sure.pls dont visit"}
{"text":"Very disappoint how quickly downhill the quality has gone in 1 year.

The food and servive is now very bad.

Food wise, 

1) I found  fish bone in my sushi, which should never happen if they got their salmon sourced from a licensed manufacture (I worked at a sushi restaurant before) some restaurants cut cost and buy unsafe NOT sushi-grade brined fish for sushi.

2) the tetaki tasted of a chemical, and not like the first time I tried it.

3) we ordered 8 pieces of sashimi, apparently nobody can count in the kitchen as our whole table only received 4

4) the kungpow shrimp, had about 3 pieces of tiny shrimp and the rest of the dish was ALL VEGETABLE just for filler

5) we ordered rolls but constantly they brought extra rolls that we didn't order, if you don't finish them they charge you extra

6) we waited an hour for our desserts to come, we ended up leaving because it took too long.

7) they spent no effort plating our food, most of it was just arranged normally with no garnish, we spent 35 dollars on each person.

SERVICE

was also horrid, most of the staff could not speak English, the buffet seafood area was rarely stocked with crab legs we had to wait the whole meal just for someone to restock it! 

I will not come back to Ye's sushi anymore and would not recommend it to my friends/family."}
{"text":"Came to Ye's Sushi with two friends for lunch one afternoon after much anticipation and excitement for the all you can eat sushi. Upon arrival there was no one at the front desk to seat us. No big deal right, so we just waited and figured it would be a couple minutes for the host/hostess to come back. We waited for 25 minutes, and in this time not one person came to acknowledge us or to put our name on a wait list or to let us know how long the wait would be. Although, many of the workers would just walk by and avoid eye contact?? 

Overall, Ye's Sushi has the most horrible customer service i've experienced and was essentially the biggest waste of time"}
{"text":"Decent food, but service is lacking...Got flack and judgmental stares for ordering food (admittingly, we were starving that day and did went a bit overboard)....did not appreciate servers pointing and speaking chinese behind our table (fyi, WE UNDERSTOOD AND CHOSE TO SPEAK IN ENGLISH)...food was decent in quality and is reflected in the price for sure...worth a try at least once. The selling point of the restaurant is the decor, ambiance and automated ordering system. Pay a bit of respect towards your patrons and perhaps this restaurant would have a winning chance."}
{"text":"Second time here! This place always reminds me of the fresh seafood I get when I'm in Vancouver!!! 5 star no doubt!"}
{"text":"Came here for my sister's birthday.  

Likes:
-Very good, urban design.
-Self serve salad and dessert bar with soft serve ice cream
-Rolls are pretty flavourful.  

Dislikes:
-I feel this is reminiscent of 2010 AYCE sushi.  Heavy on rice, not enough rice vinegar on the sushi.  
-All the fried food was either too oily, burnt (chicken wings and beef short ribs were horrible).
-Service isn't the best. Everyone seems rushed.

Verdict: It's not bad for a first time sushi AYCEer, but there are much better places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when this place first opened. When I went tonight the service was bad. Waited at the door for 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged us. When we were seated the table was so sticky and dirty. 
The server was bad to. She took our drink order and after that never came back. She was calling across the dinner room at another server. Very young girl seemed like she didn't event care to be working. 

As we were eating we noticed that there were cob webs everywhere. It's was so dusty and dirty. With the air moving in the place you could see the cob webs move. Honestly it was so dirty. I would never go back. This place used to be good now it's just dirty with poor service. Not worth the money what so ever!!! STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"New AYCE sushi restaurant on the Oakville Mississauga border! The restaurant is spacious and tastefully decorated. Service was very friendly and quick. However the food is below par. The sashimi was fine but some of the nigiri was poorly constructed - it practically fell apart when I picked it up. The dim sum dishes were a disappointment- the dumplings had barely any filling and were very bland. I really like the small self serve salad bar that includes the seaweed salad, mussels, shrimp, crab salad, etc.  And there's also a dessert bar. It's worth a try since they have such an extensive menu but I will give them some time to settle in before I return again. For $26.99 (weekend dinner) I expect better food - even for an AYCE restaurant."}
{"text":"First off I have to say I enjoyed the food (whatever food that actually made it to our table). . What ruined the dining experience was the complete lack of service. Our server dismisses our concern with our missing order not arriving even after an hour wait, and it never did arrive.  We were forced to get our desert before all our food arrived, which is what I would assume, is a tactic they use to get you out the door without the food you are paying to eat. Even though the food quality was great, I didn't enjoy the sub par service and will not return. I'd rather eat at mandarin across the street."}
{"text":"If you ever wished that you could enjoy all you can eat sushi in Mississauga with an awesome salad bar (complete with mussels and shrimp) and a night club-setting, this is the place to go! Okay, maybe you're not looking for that specifically but it sure is an awesome AYCE Sushi joint imo.

I noticed on the weekends they play Top 40 music but on the weekdays, it's light, Asian-themed music (I'm not a fan but it sure beats listening to \"Panda\" while I'm trying to enjoy some spicy salmon rolls!) 

The selection is great if you're looking for sushi, dim sum and Thai-inspired dishes. While you're waiting for your dishes, which isn't a long wait, you can go to the salad bar and dig into some tasty starters like shrimp, mussels and seaweed salad (my fav!). All of the seafood is kept on ice and I've never seen it melt so that's a good sign that they're keeping it fresh! 

It's obviously more worth it to come for lunch ($14.99) on a weekday but I don't mind dishing out the $24 for a weekend meal just because the food is so bangin'. 

I love the atmosphere and everything is always clean. 

I've had good and bad servers here but it's progressively getting better and better so that's a plus! I love it when restaurants get better with each visit, don't you? 

They always accommodate me and my baby (9 months) so don't be afraid to bring the kids!"}
{"text":"It was a really nice place compared to most all you can eat places I have been to. The bar made the difference! My waitress brought me one wrong dish but other than that I can't complain! I love the decor of the place!  they have an aquarium at the front I love aquariums!"}
{"text":"I think the quality is too poor compared to how much it cost. Don't think I will visit this place again... ordered several stuff but just got one dish in 30 mins of waiting. Eventually got tired of waiting then just decided to pay and leave."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the quality of food and service here - wish there was an option to give less than 1 star here. Servers are abrupt, food is barely passable. Pictures below should be quite explanatory. They try to pack so much rice in each bite of sushi with minimal amount of fish to make customers full faster.

Btw - there is a sign by the door saying if you give 5 stars on Yelp, you can get a free pop on them. No thanks, I'd rather pay for my own drink and never come back here. Take the \"5 star reviews\" on this page with a huge grain of salt.

To Ye's - rather than bribing your customers for positive reviews - maybe take a different approach by not trying to rip them off with subpar quality food, and you'll naturally get better ratings. People pay for your food here, you should reciprocate by showing a minimal degree of decency and integrity in the food that you serve to them."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because my kids live the soft ice team bar and waffles.  But it's going down hill.  Even though they had added sashimi to the menu and a few more rolls, the quality is going down. One of the salmon hand rolls had a sliver of salmon.  The service is going downhill also. They keep messing up at least one order every time I come.  Today the empty plates just piled up even though several servers were walking by. 

This place needs an onsite manager in the restaurant at all times to manage the staff, the chefs and the food quality.  Otherwise, this place won't be the success that it can be."}
{"text":"Greatly decorated place. The service was nice, the food arrived fast, the selections were okay but very limited. Some food were great and some were just too bland. Maybe a bit more rice vinegar for the sushi? And less rice on the sushi roll to be able to taste the flavour? Overall, its alright. Id go again if my friends ever asked to go, but i wouldn't choose to go if i had another choice. 

And by the way, some waitresses did not ask if i was done with a plate... Which i got sad about :( 

Recommended:
- cheese cake
- grilled salmon sushi
- green salad chipotle
- cheese wontons"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant in the town. Great sushi and excellent service! Strong recommend!"}
{"text":"Came all the way from Markham for a toddlers birthday dinner. Decor looks cool.There are crabs legs, cold Mussels and salad at the buffet table at the back. Food are so so. Nothing extraordinary. The hi-light was the service. We asked more than 3 times to clear out the empty plates which are loaded on our table, we even spoke to the manager about it and still no one came to clean up. They said they were short staff, but on a busy Saturday evening? I doubt I will come back as AYCE sushi restaurant are everywhere which I may better spend the $30pp. My stars are given for the crab legs and sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"I go more often than I should, mostly because it's location is good for me, they have IPAD ordering, they have a cash discount as well. 
Sushi is fresh well prepared, options are not bad for lunch (no sashimi) but all the standard rolls, sushi pizza, veggie maki, tempura, fusion foods such as noodles, tempura, grilled etc overall a pretty good mix. Service is prompt friendly and they bring tea, the items and have a salad bar option as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. 
Good pricing. Close to home. 
Seating was comfortable. 
Staff was very polite. Many choice of deserts."}
{"text":"The food quality is okay. The order is made through iPad, but they forgot some of our orders. The staff is rude. When we waived the hand, the waiter just said wait wait and never come back. The other one came here said we are making, should be quick. Later on, when we complained, the staff said we forgot your order and it could be technical issues. So disappointed about the service."}
{"text":"Came here last night to curb my sushi craving but didn't want to drive all the way to Oakville or Burlington for my favourite places. It was fairly quiet but it was a Sunday evening. The staff is a bit abrupt, it was a bit odd but they were efficient so hey no time for pleasantries but I get my food in a timely manner. 
My mom ordered a Mongolian meat dish, I ordered the avocado sushi pizza, the crunchy veg rolls and the yam rolls. The sushi pizza was very good but I picked off the seaweed salad and left it for my mom as I am not a fan. No sushi pizza has come close to the one off of Burloak. The spicy crunch rolls were very good, the yam rolls were meh. They had too big of pieces of yam and the tempura batter was not fully cooked. My mom's dish smelled amazing and she loved it. They didn't provide wasabi or ginger we had to ask, perhaps they are used to people only coming for all you can eat. So overall it was OK, good prices, quick service, nice atmosphere by the way very cool inside. I think it would be a good all you can eat place but all I can eat is a pretty pathetic amount so I never do AYCE."}
{"text":"The food is bland. It's horrible to be hungry and love sushi and come to a place only to be disappointed. 

When we tried to talk to the manager about our dissatisfaction, he argued with us and kept saying, \"we have over 200 items on our menu\". 

Don't bother paying $27 for dinner, all you can eat. It's a huge loss."}
{"text":"Lots of varieties of sushi. Love the idea of ordering from iPod menu. Everything was very fresh and tasty. Beautiful modern restaurant. Friendly and polite customer service."}
{"text":"I have driven by this sushi place so many times but usually I hit my usual joints when I am in the mood for sushi , today I decided to drop by with a friend for some sushi lunch , the place is stunning inside gorgeous decor very clean , and staff was very friendly and attentive to any need I had ...

The food was just fabulous I have been to many sushi places in mississauga but as far as the variety and amount of different selection of sushi I think Yes Sushi beats them all...specially for a lunch menu ...apparently they also have a lot of sea food on weekend dinner menu 

Highly recommend great food overall best lunch place sushi in mississauga oakville area"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food and great look. I was far more impressed with presentation than food quality, it's not exceptional but not terrible."}
{"text":"Well last night I went to YES sushi ....
Walking into the place I thought WOW!!!
It's really nice ! , very modern , very sheik !!
The place looks amazing , definitely  a place you'd love to bring your special Date , your woman or man or even friends or family to impress !! 
So we sit down 630 pm on a Friday evening .
It was kinda funny they were playing country music at 1st pretty loud I felt like I was in a sushi place in Nashville ..then it switched to EDM so i felt like I was in a club in downtown toronto about to throw down some sushi with some Guido from Woodbridge ! They have
Nice tablet Menus as most modern AYCE places now have ...we are greeted by a nice waiter very friendly .
We put in our 1st round of orders ...
It's now 710pm so 40 minuets we get 1 dish ..
It was the wrong one lol 730 pm we get the 2nd dish wrong one again .....740 pm 3rd dish ..guess what it was a right order ...woohoo......sashimi ......great right ! Well it was the smallest pieces of sashimi I've ever had in my life and to be honest not the best . We were shocked ......anyways its now 750 pm we get another dish ...guess what ...wrong dish again ...but i didn't care I was so hungry at this point i woulda started eating my shirt ...so i have to say , they were busy .
But that doesn't give any excuse for the poor quality of sushi - food and other waiters service,  servers to constantly mix up orders is unprofessional...I heard the table beside us say ..\"I didn't order chicken \" lol.. was kinda funny at this point .
All the servers looked very young like under 18 to be honest ..maybe there's your problem ..but then again if maybe they were trained better they wouldn't screw up orders everywere .
But then again I'm sure the cooks and sushi chefs aren't under 18 ..well I hope not . So what ls the deal with the poor quality food ? I dunno .....
Needless to say .......i won't be back which is very sad because the place is beautiful . Very disappointed in the quality of food .
I have to mention our server was a nice guy it's a shame everyone that brought the food was lost and reflected poorly on everything .

Whoever wrote this place is one of the best sushi places in mississauaga has definitely not been to any other sushi places in mississauaga or in fact anywere in this city !! 

For $26 a person I recommend somewere else and if there's a lineup have fun waiting hours for your food .
In the end ...

{"text":"First time here. Give it a try. Reviews looks good. Why not. I live close by. Trying the food now and will give after thoughts, hang tight hang tight"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice now and the same results.  I'm never going back again!  First off, the place looks decent based on decor.  But don't let that fool you because that's about the only thing they have going for them. The food is very mediocre compare to something similar like Spoon and Fork Plus.  The service is horrible!!! Both times we were left without anybody who could competently answer our requests in english.  Out of 5 servers on the floor only one spoke english.  The rest looked like chinese refugees who just came out of a container.   The server we had kept insisting on food we didn't order.  Wasabi had to be kept out of sight.  Napkins were in short supply.  And that \"call server\" button on their ipad does not work, maybe because of english difficulties.  
When it was time to pay, they gave us a bill that we gladly paid and put a 10% tip because the service was shit!   Then the unthinkable happened.  Our server came back and said we had paid the wrong bill because ours should've had 2 extra pop.  The server didn't even own up to the mistake and said that it was my mistake instead.  I couldn't believe it so I insisted to see the manager.  The \"manager\" was a young chinese dude who knew nothing but to bow and smile.  Kept on insisting it was their mistake but insisted I pay the $3.61 for the drinks they missed on the initial bill.  At this point, I just wanted to get the fuck out of this hell hole.  If I was running the joint, I would've swallowed the few measly dollars as a lost from the drinks instead of pissing off the customer who will never return here again."}
{"text":"My wife and brothers family had a great time. Food was good and hot. It was served quickly and we left way to full! We have been several times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is my most visited restaurant of 2016.
I love this place.
It's my favorite.

Dinner menu has a few extra items than the lunch menu. I've done the dinner once. It's mostly additional meat items like octopus balls and bacon wrapped scallop type things. I personally prefer the lunch menu.

Presentation is tops.
Selection is terrif.
Ambiance I dig.
Like I said, my favorite.

50% off on your birthday too! :P"}
{"text":"All I can say is .....$16.99 for lunch, all you can eat.....fresh fresh fresh!! 
The hubby and I just happened to need lunch in the area. Mr eagle eye saw their sign and thought it could be worth the stop. 
And boy was it ever.
Everything we ordered came in good time but was also cooked fresh. No leftover pieces here. Sushi was great, and I'm not a huge rice fan but theirs was cooked to perfection! And they had bbq eel on the lunch menu!! Surprise!! 
Dessert was a self serve, other than their deep fried milk and deep fried banana. They have ginger ice cream too. The only other place I had that was in New York city a few years ago. Bonus!!  So if you're in the area make sure to try them out. I don't think you'll be disappointed!!  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I was a dissatisfied camper! 2.5 stars. 

Upon entering this new sushi joint I was super excited, the decor was very grand and there was a lot of empty tables since it's still new. We ordered the usual tempura, sirloin steak, tuna and salmon sashimi, spider roll( my fave roll but not my fave here), fire torched salmon and tuna sushi, chicken wings and the list goes on. 

Salad and dessert are not on the menu. You have to go to the front and pick your salad and dessert, buffet style. Also it's worth mentioning that this place has an ipad menu! But no description on the menu items like some sushi restaurants do. The sashimi were fresh and my fave. The rolls we're super big! Too much rice! The crispy bits on the crispy salmon were far from crispy, they were stale! The eel fried rice had 4 pieces of small eel, super disappointed about that! The spider roll was not a light crispy soft shell crab! So sad. Their flame torched rolls were pretty good! And I mean only the salmon was my fave. When it came to get dessert the waffle was so chewy and not fresh, and some of the ice cream we're so hard from freezer burn, but I like that they have soft serve and creme bruleé. 

The service was pretty good, and fast which was expected since the place was quiet. Overall this place has it's ups and a lot of downs. They definitely need to improve a lot of things for this place's rating to go up and be well known."}
{"text":"I grabbed some take out on a Saturday early evening. It was not crowded when I arrived but quickly got busy within a half hour.
I ordered yam tempura sushi and veg pad Thai to go and my order was ready within 15 minutes.
I had several errands to do before I could eat so the pad Thai was all clumped together by the time I opened it. They stuffed the container with a large amount that was enough for 3 servings. The sushi was 8 pieces and tasted good. The pad Thai was rather bland.
It was a convenient stop on the day I went....not sure if I would go out of my way to go eat there."}
{"text":"I was invited here tonight by my cousin Elie.
It's been a while since we had sushi and the three of us where all entirely in the mood for it.
I'm rating this place 8/10 overall for the great value for money. At 30$ for all you can eat menu choices, you can't find a better deal in Ontario.
I like the system and the service was really friendly and good also. The quality of the sushi/sashimi was also really nice. On the salad bar they had fresh crab legs which none of us touched because it's lot of work. They also had a desert bar which had limited but good choices to include: ginger, red bean, green tea, and black sesame ice creams. The ice creams where really good and my cousin really liked the cheesecake.

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Nice deco, but horrible food. Never had all-you-can-eat sushi like this! Do not come if you treasure life :)"}
{"text":"Came here once, and I'll say it's the last time I'll ever go in there. When you first walk in, the look of the place is really high end and classy. It's definitely got that \"WOW\" factor to it. We went on a Wednesday night, and there were lots of available tables, however we had to wait a good 10 minutes before we were seated. We got our ipad and started ordering, looked good so far. After we ordered, we went to the salad bar which was good. We ended up waiting for at least 30-40 minutes before we started seeing food on our table. And half of the food, was NOT good. (I'm not a picky person either, I will eat a lot of things) but when the chicken and meat we were ordering came freezing cold, we were totally turned off. The sushi rolls were alright, probably the only thing I enjoyed. Service was extremely slow, food came out slow, half of our food that we ordered never came. It took us complaining to the manager to get better service. And the dessert bar, don't bother. All in all, there are much better all you can eat sushi places."}
{"text":"I came here by just searching through what to eat. I was surprised that the a lot of the reviews are bad. But I decided to give a try. 
But I like it . The selections are great! I mean tons of different food ! Let's go for sashimi, fresh, and they have tuna , which I do like tuna! It's a big point for me! 
Sushi nigiri are good! I like the seared sushi, tasty sauce on top! The natural fat of the fish and light sweet Japanese mayo, nice incorporated! 
The seared sushi roll is also really yummy, creamy , rice ratio is good? 
Hit food are nice as well, I didn't taste a lot of the hot food because I am more in to sashimi and sushi. 
But I will say watch out for the Chinese dish like mapo tofu and sweet and sour stuff , I don't recommend! 
I love the bacon and tomato skewer, really nice combination, the fresh taste of the tomato can take out the greasy taste of the bacon! A bit sour and salty and a pitch of chilly power to add the heat!
Don't recommend the ramen . I don't usually try ramen in AYCE because I know it's going to be disappointing. That goes to all the AYCE places. 
I will go back ."}
{"text":"Average selection. Certain food items seemed over cooked- nice looking restaurant for large groups.  Did not meet my personal food expectations unfortunately!"}
{"text":"How come there is no 0 star!!!! Ok fine I will give this star to the service. This is the worst sushi I have ever had. The taste was awful. First of all, when you use your iPad to order, do not pay attention to how the pictures looks. Because it is nothing like the picture. Second, do not go for anything you never see before. Because it will turn out to be disaster, such as eel and cheese...ehhh don't even think about that again. Third, always offer more because they will not give you all you ordered. Forth, they add some kind of creamy sauce on top of most sushi which makes them become some wired food. I definitely will never go there again and won't recommend anyone I know to this place."}
{"text":"Been here many times, and their Ayce sushi is among the best I could find in the GTA, bar none. Highly recommended, worth the drive."}
{"text":"It was the worst food in the history of cooking. And we threw half out. The chef should be fired because it was disgusting. The noodles gave a whole new meaning to the word sickening. You guys should stop paying people to give good reviews cause clearly this place is a disaster!!!! If I could rate this 0, I would.

I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE...EVER!!!!!!! Waste of money!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  iPad ordering, salad bar, desert bar, spacious, great interior design. 

Great for the family or to bring a date. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My kids love it!

The food is similar to what you can find in similar places but there are some items that make this place better (Dim Sum)"}
{"text":"Worst sushi restaurant ever!!! Soups are tasteless. You just feel like you drinking hot water. And the sushi itself \"sashimi,rolls,...\" tasted nasty!!!! I think it wasn't fresh as it had the weird taste. I eat sushi a lot and i know how the real fresh one taste like. So bottom line, Ye's is the worst!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool concept. Ye's is an all you can eat sushi place and every table has an iPad for you to place your orders on. 

Food- the selection here is HUGE. They have soooo many choices, even Thai and dimsum. The food itself was pretty decent. I would recommend the pressed salmon sushi and the wonton soup. At the back of the restaurant they also have a salad bar(v limited selection) and a dessert bar(subpar). I did not like the Creme brûlée and the egg tart, they did not know how to make it right. However, the ordered food was all pretty good. 

Service-maybe it was because it was a busy hour but the ordered food did take some time to arrive at first. The servers were nice though.

Ambiance- I love the decor. It's very stylish and the restaurant feels very roomy with a high ceiling. 


Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Terrible service on a Sunday lunch! The staff doesn't pick up our dishes, even when we fully put it aside because we're done and just continues to deliver new items. There's no description for most of the items on the menu and the staff can't communicate whats in the food. Waited over 1 hour for our the first order of spring rolls! Don't order the spring rolls, their greasy and contain chicken in it! No mention of  the chicken too!  Won't be back ever again!"}
{"text":"Ye's sushi is ayce sushi combined with Mandarin (but better quality food). The self serve salad/dessert bar is the main differentiator between Ye's and other GTA sushi spots. 
It definitely cuts the waiting time because you can get food as you please.

Service is really friendly and the restaurant itself is massive and a really great place for celebratory group dinners. Their food is comparable to Heart Sushi but Heart always takes the cake with the sashimi!

I can't remember the exact prices, but I remember the lunch ayce price is pretty good!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Sushi YES
Order from a tablet YES
The 4-5 Rings in the middle remind you of Halo videos games getting that Samurai armour YES
Tempted to jump over each ring to get the armour unlock  YES
Alright now down to the food small portions yet tasty so order more if you like it.  I've order a lot with 4-6 ppl noticed that some orders didn't come thru so I just  reordered and made sure they came thru this time.  The salad bar and dessert is in the back so help yourself.  The place is nice new and big.  The food doesn't look like like some of the pictures so they should work on that. Price wise not bad definitely doesn't hurt the wallet under $20 per person.  Only drawback not baby seat friend most of the booths already fairly tight hard to eat comfortable if you small kids aren't comfortable in their seating arrangements.  Good place to eat with friends and enjoy the ambience and the sports on TV. I've been here 3 times and I can see myself going here when I need that sashimi fix again.  Check it out if you're around that area"}
{"text":"I went to Ye's Sushi for the first time and the customer service was terrible. They didn't give me the correct quantity of food when I ordered it from the ipad. I told them they gave me the wrong quantity and they asked me to reorder it again from the ipad. Other sushi places would happily say sorry and give me my correct amount of food when I addressed it to them but the workers at Ye's Sushi didn't seem to care about their customers and the restaurant wasn't even busy.  Food was satisfactory."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a Sunday and we although we were super excited to try it out, let's just say it was a big disappointment. 

I will start off and say that Ye's Sushi is quite big and has a very appealing menu as they had a lot of options that other AYCE sushi places don't offer, but don't be fooled... 

The sushi didn't really taste fresh and the fish is cut very thinly and they pack a lot of rice in their sushi and rolls! I mean, I would say their torched sushi and compressed sushi were probably the best, but everything their sushi and rolls were pretty bad. In terms of their kitchen dishes, I couldn't think of anything bad to say, but also nothing to rave about it either. 

I will say that they had a pretty good dessert selection and they had cones and a self serve ice cream machine! (As you can see, I'm super hyped about the dessert at an AYCE sushi place, that should tell you something.. ). I don't think I'll ever be returning back to here unless they make some serious changes."}
{"text":"Overall it's not bad except for the line up.. We waited for almost an hour. Food is yummy.. Love the red dragon roll and green dragon roll..."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for the waitresses.  Although I can understand why some customers get upset after waiting long.......why don't you just reorder?

To speak for the wait staff, some of them difficult to speak English....Ye's had a policy where they expect their wait staff to show up 11 am......but if it is slow, they would not pay the staff between either 2pm or 3pm......then ask them to come back 5pm or 6 pm.   So basically some of the unfortunate staff members end up devoting all their hours to Ye's sushi.......working from 11am till 930pm, but only get paid six hours depending which staff member.   So sometimes the staff gets a break between 230pm to 530 pm, don't get paid during that long break.....think about it. If your employer required you to work 11 am till 930 pm, would you be loving customers if you only got paid six hours. But a few fortunate wait staff did not have to go through that.  I'm just saying, some of the wait staff got treated ok, but others did not get enough hours even tho they devoted lots of time.

I can understand why some customers don't tip as the meal can be expensive enough......but you should give at least a little bit....even if it's a few dollars.  Every little bit helps. If your unhappy with the service but the waitstaff did try, maybe give at least a few bucks.

And as for people constantly ordering sashimi.....it's impossible for a sushi restaurant to constantly give that much fish without going out of business. Maybe order a mixture of fish and other stuff like appetizer. If you really are a sashimi fanatic, just go to T and T supermarket. They have plenty of cheap sashimi. Don't depend on a all you cam eat buffet to give tons of sashimi. They can probably give few orders, think about it...an all you can eat sashimi? I don't think so unless the owners want to file bankruptcy.
      I'm serious, if your looking for tons of raw fish....T and T has those sashimi dishes for super cheap.  I'm assuming that is why people go to all you can eat places. To get a deal, otherwise they'd just go to a regular sushi place ( not all you can eat)
     Another tip......if a restaurant is about to close..,....just return on a different day. If it's super busy, return on a different day. They are not going to say no to your money. Just a little common sense. If you want your money's worth don't go when they are trying to cram all customers in there nor when they are about to close. And maybe go during lunch when it cheaper."}
{"text":"Yummy food and excellent service!!
Best buffet place yum yum yum

And the service is awesome
Tempura da bomb"}
{"text":"The décor here is really nice. However, we came at 6:30 on a Saturday and it is not busy at all. There are barely any desserts out which suggests to me it is often not busy on Saturdays which is kind of a problem. 
The food is OK. I can't t complain, everything was decent but not stand out at all. Bland I guess. I won't come again, I was hoping for some wow factor based on previous positive reviews. I'll go back to kanda sushi (Queensway and hurontario) which has awful decor but amazing food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We normally go to 168 Sushi down the street and thought we would give Yes Sushi a try.  The atmosphere is very nice - in fact I would say even nicer than 168 Sushi.  They have the same ordering system - on the tablets.  Our servers were nice but never cracked a smile. We were very excited to try the food. The menu looked great, with lots of options.  The food however was not so great. Everything was bland and not very tasty. The quality of the sushi and of the other foods like Thai and Chinese was low end.  We couldn't eat some of it. 
Even my girls who love the desserts at AYCE restaurants  were not impressed with the cakes offered.  They were all stale. They do have soft serve frozen yogurt, which was good and the traditional ice cream flavours.  We did enjoy that. 

While the price is a little bit less expensive than 168 sushi I would not come back or recommend.  We say NO to Yes Sushi."}
{"text":"Huge place, very sleek modern decor, full bar.  The food came pretty fast and the salmon sashimi was amazing.  Love this place and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love their sushi, especially torch sushi
My kids and I can here at least once a month. 
The reward program will help to get some discount!"}
{"text":"Ye's  is a family fav for us. Something for everyone. The iPads make it a little less personal but good is always fabulous."}
{"text":"if you're down for fancy, modern looking sushi restaurant, this is the place! They have few creative menus and I don't know where else in a sushi bar that has salad, pizza and desert bar!"}
{"text":"Terrible, why were the noodles mushy??? Were you trying to make congee with them??? Fire the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"I can see why some people give this restaurant 5 stars. It looks great. The deserts are better than most Japanese restaurants, and a lot of the menu items look interesting. Unfortunately, most of the food is bland and does not taste as good as the vast majority of the AYCE restaurants that I have eaten in. If the food was better, this place would be busy. 

Frankly, I am not convinced that this place will survive as there are better AYCE  restaurants nearby in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The food was really good,  but there was so much waiting even though the restaurant was almost empty. The servers were polite, but the wait between each course was ridiculous. We waited over 30 minutes for food in a relatively empty restaurant. 

Also,  there was no way to see which dishes had arrived and which were still coming. Some dishes ordered were missing - it was like the servers were guessing which table ordered the food. Too many concerns with the ordering system when you consider that you place your order directly on a tablet. 

There was little or no communication on the dishes, we were unsure what some dishes were as some pictures just did not match the plates. This can be very problematic when someone has an allergy at the table and we  cannot identify the dishes. Labels would go a long way! 

I would go back for lunch/dinner during the week for the tasty food and beautiful ambiance. 

However, I will pass on a weekend trip until they improve their wait times and the pictures look exactly like the plates. I cannot imagine waiting an hour for some dishes and having my order mixed up!

Lots of room for improvement with the service,  but worth a try for the food and decor."}
{"text":"Love how spacious this place is. Love the open salad and dessert bar. Like that they use the ipads as well. Overall the actual food is just average sushi. I'd go for the ambience rather than food."}
{"text":"I went to Ye's AYCE sushi Resto last night because two of my co-workers raved about it.  Bottom line...not impressed.  I've been to Heart sushi, Prince for all you can eat and this one pales in comparison (the aforementioned are still not my absolute favs either).  Here's what I did like about Ye's: attractive ambiance, great service, sashimi was very fresh, rolls were ok but not the tastiest, miso soup was pretty good.

The cons: any of the meat dishes (ie: General tsao) were over battered, very little meat.  The beef dishes had cheap cuts of rubbery meats used, the pineapple rice was plain disgusting, soya sauce must have been Dollarstore grade because it was so salty, wasabi was underwhelming, the rolls were ok as mentioned above but nothing special.  I had a spicy salmon roll and it was full of fried pieces of tempura and very little salmon.

I would save your $$ and make a trip over to D'ai Ichi Sushi which is in that same area (Winston Churchill and Dundas St).  While it's not all you can eat, it's bar none my favourite sushi place in Mississsauga.  You cannot beat their freshness on any of the items I mentioned above.  While it's not AYCE, I would much rather pay a bit more and enjoy all of my food!"}
{"text":"Very slow. Place was not even packed. We placed orders and didn't get any for 30 minutes. After making it known to the waitors... attention to the table was not made urgent. They said to reorder everything but only to wait longer and not receive anything. Fire grilled sushi was not the best. Definitely not worth it. Ended up leaving."}
