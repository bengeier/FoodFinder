{"text":"We have been ordering takeout from here for months. The food always arrives fresh and HOT. We like spicy and theirs tends to run weak but its always fast service. Never had an issue."}
{"text":"Food was good. It's a lot of soy sauce, very flavoful. It's my first time here, it won't be the last. I think it's one of the best Chinese fast food in east Mesa. I had a moo goo gain pan with hot and sour soup! It was cooked to order. Yum'"}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Chinese take out. If the wontons or egg-rolls taste like old oil I never order from the place again. The wontons and egg-rolls were perfect!  The girl who took my order spoke clearly and I understood her and she understood me.    I ordered for delivery. It was great compared to the other delivery Chinese food places around the area, the food was hot, they packed it very well and actually separated the dishes with pieces of cardboard and double bagged it...but they are a bit timid with their spices and I like my Kung Pao chicken to make me sweat a little.  Great job Green tea!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered takeout from here after having it recommended by a few people.  We ordered the teriyaki chicken, lemon chicken, and egg rolls.  The teriyaki chicken was just okay, and the lemon chicken was dry and flavorless.  It came in the form of a chicken breast with a hard crust that fell off in one giant chunk.  My husband even joked that maybe we ordered off the healthy part of the menu because it was so flavorless!  The egg rolls were delicious, but we barely touched the rest of our meal.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, not sure, but we will most likely not be going back."}
{"text":"I just found a maggot in my food here!!!! Stay the hell away from here !  I immediately called the waitress over and she took the plate away before I could take a picture and unfortunately after eating almost half of it. She came back and said the chef would comp that plate only because they dont have those types of problems and dont know how that happened. As I was sitting there thinking about what just happened I asked to speak to a manager. She said let me get them, I heard a lot of yelling in the kitchen in their own language and she came back and said they were gone. I advised her that I was going to call the health department and she then said the chef would completely comp our entire meal."}
{"text":"Was craving crab puffs so my fiancé went here for dinner. Let's say I was very disappointed in them almost no filling, bland, lacking flavor. It would have been one star but they did save the meal with there wonton soup, it was good not amazing but ok. I think next time I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I could? I'd leave 0 stars.  I ordered dinner delivery one evening and luckily for me I wasn't terribly hungry - they arrived 15 minute shy of 2 hours! on top of that, the delivery driver had the audacity to knock on my door expecting a tip.  When I called to check on my order, an older lady answered the phone and sounded extremely pissed that I even called.  The service was a joke, and the food? even worse.  I got lukewarm dishes and had to end up throwing out most of it due to it tasting so bland!    I do not have the desire to give them a second chance nor visit their physical location.  Their food may be good at some points during the day but for the most part? their food is a wasted opportunity to gain more customers and their customer service is a complete train wreck.  There are plenty of decent, well established Chinese food stops in the area. I suggest skipping this one."}
{"text":"Fresh and served hot?Taste is also phenomenal ! Very authentic and fast too which is a plus."}
{"text":"Horrible service and management. Came in the restaurant at noon on its first day of opening and got seated at 2pm. That was okay for us because there is nothing that they can do with not enough seating for the first day, and my friend really wanted to try the food here.  After an hour and half of waiting on the seat an waiter came and told that our order sheet was lost, despite that we did ask a few waitresses to see what's happening with our order while before that.  Almost nothin else came for another 20 min until my friend went up to the desk and waited for our food in front of the staff.  Total dining time: 5 hours. Despite that we packed most of our food instead of eating there.  4 stars for the food it self, negative stars for the service."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 5 times.  Everything I've ordered is pretty tasty. Tonight I had kung pao chicken   W fried rice and won ton soup. I loved it. My mom had Lemon chicken although the breaking and sauce are good we thought the long patties is somewhat different than the norm  nugget.  Overall you get fresh food for not much money."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb at a great price. We green tea all the time. I have not been disappointed yet. Beef and broccoli is excellent!  Orange chicken awsome. Everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"I just went there and ate . The food was delicious . It's a very good place and it is also clean . I think that's the only chinese restaurant I'm going to be eating in mesa for my whole life!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to order from here on a weekly basis for delivery , until one time I had a bug in my food. The worst thing is I didn't notice it until I had already been eating. I was so grossed out I called immediately, but the lady who answered the phone was just argumentative. Instead of apologizing she went on to say how that has never happened before, almost like I wasn't telling the truth. Now my husband and I ordered from there on a weekly basis why on earth wouldn't we be telling the truth.? We were so upset by her response, and the time it took to get our money back from them for our meal, that we boycotted the place for months and months. They never even offered to give our money back for my husbands food, only mine. We both felt that was completely unprofessional. It was the least they could have done. To be honest we were getting pretty turned off by the place anyway because everytime we called the lady was very rude and short on the phone. Since it had been so many months, almost a year now, we decided to give them a second chance and went into their location to eat. The same lady who answers the phone was there and served us. She was very unprofessional, non friendly, and the place didn't look customer friendly at all. Stuff all over the counter in the back, terrible lighting, and the bathroom definitely needed cleaning. The food tasted great though. Then we decided a few weeks after that to have delivery to our home. The lady on the phone remembered me or somehow put it in the system. Instead of saying welcome back we missed you she just said \"Oh you are ordering again didn't you have problems last time.\"  I should have responded with \"Say, great memory this time can you make sure there aren't any bugs in my food, and you're welcome for my business.\" we will never order from here again they lost a very very good customer for life. In the restaurant business word of mouth means everything that is something this establishment needs to understand because none of my friends or family will ever eat here again. This place needs friendly service on the phone and in person, with empathetic people who understand business and how you are supposed to conduct yourself. If I owned a restaurant business and somebody ordered from me on a weekly basis, and then had an issue one time I would have handled it as if that person meant everything to me. They are clueless."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating food from here, so I hope it's just today's cook. This place is a typical Chinese take out / dine in place. Limited seating. Pretty dusty. Now to the food, the important part. I ordered chicken fried rice and general tso chicken. Very basic, so how does a place that supposedly ( according to the menu) specializes in this dish mess it up? The rice is without a doubt bland and had zero seasoning. It's as if the chicken was boiled then cooled and mixed in with the rice without any seasoning at all. Then the actual general tso chicken was bland despite having a decent amount of breading. Everything just seemed a bit under cooked. It's not expensive but I would at least like some typical seasoning to be added for taste. This was the first and will definitely be the last time I get food from here. Hopefully your experiences are better than mine."}
{"text":"Very badly organized. The number waiting system is not in order so it's hard to gauge the order. Also, they can't tell you how long it will take or how many tables of similar size are in front of you.   Although their ad says first come first serve, it is misleading. They let in some \"reserved\" tables and leave some tables empty."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice seats that my friends enjoyed as it is quite private and makes the dining experience better. The tea pots are very aesthetically pleasing but don't hold much and hey are extremely heavy, not so user-friendly. The staff was to the point but nothing special. The food is good but menu is somewhat misleading, as they put dessert items in the normal menu section and it makes it difficult to choose wisely.  Overall good experience but the little flaws bring t down to 3 stars."}
{"text":"First and Last visit to this place. First indication was the dirty, smeary front door.  Hostess was about as friendly as a rattlesnake.  Food was mediocre to poor. Prices were very reasonable.  I had the Mongolian Beef Combo Plate.  Was not spicy and mostly undercooked onions.  Husband had beef lo mein combo plate.  He was not happy.  The pu pu platter ($10.25) had a good variety of items but the deep fried prawns were doughy.  The décor needs a facelift. All in all a poor restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant can go either way. So 3 star it is! It's definitely spicy, everything's got a bit of a kick.  My favorites and what I would order again:  Thousand year old egg and tofu. They make it like a layered cake, alternating layers. The flavour is really good. And I like how they've made it really differently.   Oyster pancake. They make it really crispy here (ie oily) and it's also packed with flavour.   And here's what I would order only once:  Skewers. I ordered these really spicy skewers but they were cold? And not that impressive.   Pork short ribs. Not worth it   And Chinese sausage on rice in a bamboo tube.   There was a bit of a line up on a weekday."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The prices are a little more expensive than your average Chinese restaurant, but the food is delicious! My favourite dish here is the pork belly and also the salted egg yolk chicken wings. I love the pork belly because they serve it on a hot skillet and it's very hot while eating the entire dish. I also love salted egg yolk anything so when it's on chicken wings I love love love! Another delicious dish but simple is the steamed egg. All I need is a bowl of rice. I believe that they take reservations with parties of 6 or more. I would recommend making a reservation because it does get busy."}
{"text":"If you are a heart patient or suffer from severe coronary disease stare clear of GREEN TEA RESTURANT In Mesa. Had a craving for Chinese food and if you look close at the pic this is way to much grease for one person to consume in one sitting, I'm  sure that the Health Department would issue a sitation. SO MY SUGGESTION TO THE OWNER WOULD TO EIRTHER FIND A NEW COOK OF CLOSE THEIR DOOR. Damn wish yelp had a ZERO RATING AND BELOW CUZ THAT'S WHAT THEY DESRVE!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service.  Average food at best if you're really patient.  This is the second time we went to Green Tea.  The first time they had just opened and once we figured out that we were to seat ourselves we waited for nearly 10 minutes for someone to come to our table.  This place wasn't very busy at all with a couple tables eating and about 3 people waiting for/ordering takeout. We scanned the menu and determined what we wanted within a few minutes.  5 minutes after that nobody had returned to the table to take our order.  Within that time I saw two couples waiting to order take out walk out.  We figured we'd do the same.  Not wanting to judge too quickly we decided we'd give them another chance.  This time we wanted take-out. We had some shopping to do at the nearby Sprouts so we placed our order prior to going shopping thinking this would insure us food when we returned.  We arrived 25 minutes later only to find that they were just starting our order. After another 15 minutes (40 minutes total now) we finally were given our order.  When we arrived at the house we discovered that they had not given us any rice.  Zero rice.  We called the store to see about coming and getting our rice and the person on the phone could not understand a word we were saying.  We kindly told them that we were very dissappointed and wouldn't be coming back.  It's unfortunate that they aren't able to recieve the feedback due to the huge language barrier.  The food they did provide us was average. We ordered typical dishes such as Kung-Pao Beef, Orange Chicken and Garlic Chicken. Did I mention we didn't have any rice?  This place really sucks.  Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Came here for a family holiday dinner. Booked in advance and got seated right away at the circular booths.  Food was delicious and well presented! Certainly lived up to its hype.   We tried a variety of dishes, my favorite was  1) BBQ pork - juicy and crispy at the same time, very flavorful 2) The congee - not your usual congee, there's this slightly crispy texture and savory taste which makes it quite addictive 3) Stuffed chicken wings - chewy shrimp paste in the inside, nicely flavored on the outside. Good balance of meat and seasoning  We were so stuffed in the end but would be interested in returning for the above dishes and try the dessert as well. This place rivals the hype of Mabu generation, which I enjoy visiting as well.   Love the decor, ambience and food. Service was good during our visit, but can see how it could be chaotic. A great place to bring friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They deliver super fast and they have the best soups. I eat here at like once a week."}
{"text":"Very disorganized seating system. Did not stream customers based on table size and no record of the customers in line. The lady at the reception has been very patient with all the questions but could not give an accurate estimate for wait time or what table they currently called."}
{"text":"WORST FOOD I'VE EVER RECEIVED!!!!! This place has horrible customer service and the food is NOT good at all. Their \"breaded chicken\" is all bread and oil and NO chicken. Their sweet and sour sauce tastes similar to water and I just bit into one of their crab rangoos to find absolutely NO filling. Save yourself the trouble, money and stomachache. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with our meal. Good soup, good entree and plentiful; enough for a second meal. The price was very reasonable and the delivery was prompt."}
{"text":"I am undecided about this restaurant as there are some good and bad points:  Food: Stuffed chicken wing was very tasty but also very expensive! They are $8 EACH wing, and minimum 3 wings per order.  Honestly my own  fault for not reading the menue details, but I ordered based on the photo and thought it was $8 for 3 wings. Granted, the wings were much bigger than I was expecting.   Honey Fried Fish is basically the shanghai style smoked fish. Marinate was good, portion looks big, but fish was very hard and had more bone than meat.    Fried Rice Cake with shredded pork: good and similar to Shanghai restaurants.  The served in bowl left much sauce and toppings to the bottom.   Service: expect a wait since it's new. We didn't get served any tea the whole time we were there.  Good thing we had ordered Taro with Milk drinks, but still surprised they didn't give any tea.   Interior: nice wide booths, tastfully done asian decor, clean.   I think I will come back to try other dishes, but holding off on recommending anyone right now.  Edit: so I came back for lunch so I can give this place one more try.  Sorry to say it was disappointing. The fried stuffed tofu puff with mayo pineapple/watermelon was good but the pumpkin with sticky rice was so bad.  It took over 35mins to arrive vs my other dish was much faster.  Very bland dish, literally all you taste is sugar and there's nothing in the sticky rice, it's literally just plain sweet rice in the pumpkin.  The pumpkin wasn't even properly scrapped inside and still had seeds inside. Maybe they should classify it as dessert."}
{"text":"today is their opening day and they offer 50% off for all items, so huge line-up and waiting time are expected.  i am just suprised to see the first 6 reviews are all 1 star by pissed-off customers due to long waiting time.  To be honest, is it fair to give the restuarant bad rating on its opening day just because they waited so long? why didn't they leave if they hate it that much.  i think these people were just using yelp to release their anger and not being reasonable.   i ordered 9 dishes (because 50% off) today and i like most of them."}
{"text":"Quick service and generally liked everything we ordered. My favorite is their house special crispy chicken. Super flavorful and tender. Sweet and sour spareribs were also delicious. The spicy chili/peanut chicken was also flavorful, crispy and not too too spicy which I like.  I've been here three times already and have still never tried their green tea pancakes... They always seem to run out of it. Oh and their brown sugar mochi is also delicious! Very soft and chewy, definitely would recommend this. Overall good experience, good food. I'd be back."}
{"text":"Toronto was attacked by ice storm! Luckily for us, we didn't have to line up to get in!   Wasn't very hungry, so decide to snack their famous dishes!  Duck soup were very flavourful yet not too oily!  Watermelon juice were refreshing!   BBQ chicken were served on hot iron plate with a candle underneath to keep the warmth. In fact, it was still lukewarm when we finish dinner.   Waiter were very friendly and helpful as well.  It is little bit on the pricy side. But it has a member price fro every dish. So, discount for royal customer are available!"}
{"text":"If you want the best chicken wings in town and the most amazing, fresh, flavorful Chinese cuisine at a reasonable price, this is THE restaurant for you! A family owned and operated business, they focus on quality cuisine instead of empty window dressing. The only down side is when the youth are providing service on the weekends--the food quality remains exceptional, but the weekend service is not nearly as attentive as during the week. This is our \"go-to\" restaurant for all cuisine Chinese!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves more than the 1 star ratings that I've been seeing on Yelp. The main reason for the low reviews is because most people have been commenting on their experience from their 50% soft opening day, which to be honest, doesn't provide an accurate representation of their food and service.  I personally really enjoyed my experience at Green Tea Restaurant. The first thing I would like to mention is their beautiful interior. Everything is imported from China, even the bricks on the walls. The design and pieces in the restaurant give you an authentic feel and great experience which is different from other Chinese restaurants. There is a variety of different seating, from 4 person booths, larger circular booth-like tables, wooden 4 person tables, and even a lovely VIP room. Inside the VIP room are beautiful blue pots lined up along the ceiling.   I had a variety of dishes, ranging from the sweet and sour pork ribs, assorted skewers, boiled chicken and pig tripe with white pepper in broth, barbeque pork, fire shrimp, pea sprouts in golden soup, green tea pancake, and the bread temptation. The sweet and sour pork ribs, soup, green tea pancake, and bread temptation were my favourites.   The sweet and sour pork ribs are very different as it has a glaze. This is great for people who enjoy sweet foods. For dessert lovers, you have to try the green tea pancakes and the bread temptation. The green tea pancakes are best when they're hot as you can really taste the toasty sesame seeds and the warm taro puree in the inside. The Bread temptation is really nice because it's simple and light. It's basically a bread block with some butter and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's definitely a good option if you're going for the brick blocks without all the syrups and sauces from other restaurants. The bread is also sooo fluffy!!  Overall, this restaurant has great options, about 80 items on their menu. It's a good place for families to dine in and if you want tasty Chinese food, you really get the quality and presentation. I will be back again to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I decided to visit this place since my friends recommended this. After a long day at work and extremely hungry, I was not ready to wait for more than thirty minutes for a table.  When my friends arrived, they suggested I check out the menu before leaving for another restaurant.  The food was quite unusual and I haven't had most of the food on the menu before, so I decided to wait.  I think the wait was around 30 minutes.    I liked the traditional decor and each seating area are semi enclosed; however, there were couple of tables with high pitch noise and volume which was extremely distracting.  The noise level was almost unbearable for me.   Furthermore, with food at this price range, I would expect better customer service, but I was a little bit disappointed since most of them did not seem like they want to work there.  I wouldn't say they were rude, but I could tell that they did not care.  There were couple of dishes that we didn't finish and the servers did not have the courtesy to ask before taking our plates away.    The chicken wing stuffed shrimp was $7.99 each and was extremely sweet with too much honey and too expensive.  BBQ fish was really unique with good aroma, but lacked seasonings.  The pork stomach, chicken and pepper soup was quite nice, but fried rice was mediocre.  The sliced beef with ox tongue in chili sauce was way too spicy, but with good seasoning.  Overall, I have mixed feelings about the food.  The overall experience with food, poor customer service and atmosphere was not really justified for a pricetag of around $45 per head."}
{"text":"Waiting for an hour to get a table, make sense that it is still a new place and people would love to try. Food is just so so, the sweet and sour pork ribs is a bit overcooked, assorted skewers and green tea pancakes is ok, but can't say it is delicious. Only the baked mushrooms with cheese really impress me. Don't give much expectation or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We live very close to this restaurant and will not be going back ever. It is unfortunate that I had to give them one star in order for me to complete this post. The customer service is terrible. We ordered our food through online delivery. The food arrived in twenty minutes as we live across the street. I ordered Szechuan Shrimp and some sort of chicken dish was delivered. I called to let them know of the mistake and had to argue with the owner for five minutes as they insisted that we ordered the chicken. Finally I told her that I could print the receipt from online. Finally they asked if we wanted the order next time, or if we wanted them to deliver the correct item. We asked them to deliver what we had ordered. They delivered the correct item thirty minutes later without apology and they asked for the other incorrect dish back as though we were trying to scam them.  The dish they delivered was a shrimp dish and contained only four small shrimp. They were clearly put out by having to correct their mistake. There are too many places to go to dinner, I do not understand why they would think it is ok to treat customers this way."}
{"text":"This place has got to be kidding.  I specifically drove to the location and explained that I did not the standard rectangle like shaped beef in my beef and onions.  I asked was the beef fresh, not frozen and did they get it frozen and processed.  The lady lied directly to my face and told me that they only have non frozen, fresh meats.  I got home and was horrified and not only that but the fried chicken wings (also frozen but expected) were actually \"horribly spoiled\"  I mean these wings after frying were GREEN in color!  I called back immediately and they sent another batch over to my home down the street and these wings were so small you would need a magnifier to see them; moreover, THEY WERE BURNED BEYOND RECOGNITION AND BLACK.  I called again and this same lady told me that they were going to tell the company where they ordered the product that it was bad!  Not my problem as a customer and she actually tried to sell me other food with more lies.  Last time I go back there.  I also noticed someone wipe their nose and commence with handling food in the kitchen right before my very eyes.  Just Nasty!"}
{"text":"Just went here on Easter long weekend because a few friends at he gym said it was worth trying for ourselves.   If your are looking for value, then this ISN'T the place. We had 4 dishes (bbq pork fried rice, bbq pork belly on a hot plate, bbq fish on a hot place and spicy skewers) for 2 adults and 3 kids and the bill, including tip and taxes, came up to $80+. Portion size was small/medium at best.   Luckily my kids weren't too hungry and as for taste, felt there was a lot of seasoning.  Servers were polite, but I had to ask for everything (ie. more tea, another place setting as we were at a table setup for 4 ppl, etc.)  I would go here again if I wanted something a bit more unique and I wasn't paying, but for the price, I'll try my luck in one of the many other chinese restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"My sister got a couple of rolls and salads on Oct 31. She said the fish was old and smelly and salad was wilted. She ended up with food poisoning. Stay Away!"}
{"text":"Went at an early dinner time (5:30) and it wasn't busy at all. The dishes we got were really good and the staff was really attentive. Definitely get the fried vermicelli noodles (more like a glass noodle) and the mince pork eggplant. Definitely would come back. But a little pricey."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 30+ times. Quality ingredients, excellent taste, super fast delivery and great value. Have never had one bad experience. And the lunch specials are crazy cheap and generous portions. We love this place."}
{"text":"This place literally serve you BBQ pork meat at the price of premium steak.  And this is nothing like the green tea restaurant from mainland China. The original Green tea serves you dishes in smaller portions but all are so delegated made and tasty. This so called green tea in Toronto serve you food with quality on par with something you would get from a food court such as Panda Express but charge crazy money. So all in all to summarize, the food sucks, and the price is even worse. Avoid at all cost"}
{"text":"I'm picky with Chinese but I love it. Very authentic and excels you what I've been looking for for being close to home! Amazing beef fried rice and I love the wonton soup hits the spot for sure !!!! Thank you for being so quick too!"}
{"text":"Very salty, overpriced, dont try it. It's newly opened so people just want to try it out, but honestly it's worth nothing to try a restaurant like this, I would rather go eat McDonald's"}
{"text":"The food is good have eaten here a few times. I would suggest getting your food to do though"}
{"text":"Heard and saw the crazy hype when it first opened. Tried once on a sunday evening and it was so packed i didnt bother. Came here after work at around 530pm and there was more then sufficient seatings available. Once you step in , the decor makes you feel like you've entered a historic chinese restaurant. The food is quite expensive and each dish has a membership price & a regular price. To my surprise all three dishes were delicious & was hot! Very flavorful- maybe a little on the saltier side. Great variety of food choices and service was good. My mom ended up paying 20 dollars for a 2yr membership card so we can eat here with the discounted prices. 20 dollars is def worth it if you come here a couple of times w a group of people - this meal alone we saved approx 5 dollars. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a place like this.  Great Asian lunch specials!    One soda and one FRESH brewed iced tea First they served a great Miso soup. Then we got a nice iceberg lettuce salad with a tasty dressing. Then we got our main dish.  I ordered the: 2 sushi rolls of my choice                                                     friend ordered: Asian beef with steamed rice  Sushi was fresh and put together well (not loose and falling apart).  I recommend the eel and cucumber roll.  Very good!  My friend liked his meal as well.  He even poured his left over sauce over the last of his rice he liked it so much.  Total bill 15.95.  We added a 25% tip to that because the service was good, just a little hard to understand (she got everything right in the end)."}
{"text":"If I can give this a negative I would. What is the hype of this restaurant?! We made RSVP for 12 people at 6pm. When we got there, we were told we have to use the VIP room and we HAVE to spend $300 dollars to use the room. This was not mentioned on the phone nor they advertise this anywhere on their website. For paying the VIP price, we did not get VIP service. We often had to flag them down multiple of times before they would even acknowledge us.   Food: They are horrible. I thought they were known for their green tea mochi, which tasted like dry bread. Nothing was worth the money. Sure the prices are fairly decent, but I rather go somewhere else that actually taste so much better.  We pretty much ordered a different variety of food choices, and none of them were good. We must have ordered at least 12 dishes. You know, because they made us spend the $300 in the VIP room without the VIP service.   To be honest, I think the only thing I can remember that relatively tasted good was the rice. But then again you can't mess up on that.    Overall disappointing experience for the price range and quality."}
{"text":"i love this place fresh food organic items need to try it, if you want quick service and nasty food, go to panda express they have a cafeteria line to serve the herd if you want fresh food some of the best in my opinion"}
{"text":"The prices at Green Tea Restaurant are quite high for a Chinese restaurant considering that most Chinese restaurants offer cheap to moderate prices for shareable plates.  Their menu also indicates a \"regular\" price and one for \"VIP members\".  Apparently their VIP card is $20 and good for one year (don't quote me on this).  We paid the regular price since we didn't buy or have a VIP card.  After placing our order, the first dish arrived so quickly!  This was the Stir Fried Lamb on Sizzling Hot Stone Plate.  This was indeed on a sizzling hot stone plate!  The lamb was sizzling so loudly when it arrived at the table!  The hot stone plate was heavy in weight and it kept the dish warm right up until we left the restaurant pretty much (an hour later).  There were substantial slices of the stir fried lamb mixed with lots of green onions and chives.  If you like green onions and chives, this is definitely your dish.  I adored the seasoning of the lamb slices!  It was so well done and cooked.  It was such a savory dish to my liking.  I ate so many of the slices.   The second dish to arrive was the Steamed Pumpkin Stuffed with Sticky Rice and Mixed with Honey.  This was such a unique dish and I've never seen it anywhere before.  This was more of a dessert since it was a sweet dish.  The steamed pumpkin's \"lid\" was lifted open to review the sticky rice inside.  You could use the spoon to scoop out the sweet pumpkin flesh along with the sticky rice to eat together.  It was a really homey and comforting dish!  Although the sticky rice was plain in flavour, the sweetness of the pumpkin enhanced it.  Our third dish was the Assorted Mushroom Baked with Cheese.  I had been curious about this dish since seeing it on the menu last time when we were waiting for a table.  It turned out to be a not-so-authentic Southern Chinese dish as I'm not sure if authentic Southern Chinese dishes from Hangzhou actually use baked cheese in their food?  Even if they do use cheese, I highly doubt that they use American style cheddar and mozzarella cheese in their dish.   This was essentially what it was.  There was a layer of assorted mushrooms (king oyster mushrooms and other types) with a huge layer of cheddar and mozzarella cheese baked on top of it.  While the amount of cheese that was used was ample and generous, it wasn't the best dish since it seemed a little out of place in a restaurant like this.  As a cheese lover though, I definitely loved the huge layer of cheesy cheese that stayed warm throughout the visit too.  The service here was good.  A server kept walking over to our table to check on us to see how we were doing without interrupting us.  Even when we weren't able to log into the free wifi network, the server followed up with us.  Alas, the free wifi network didn't work no matter how many times we tried to input the password.   While I enjoyed the food and flavours here at Green Tea Restaurant, I think their prices are very high for elevated Chinese food (unless you get the VIP card and split it with a lot of people when dining in, I guess).  Their interior is gorgeous and all imported from Hangzhou, China!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise inside judging from the outside. My gf and I went here on a random week night. We ordered the fried fish with honey and soy sauce, some Chinese veggies, and fire shrimp. The fried fish was cold in a saucy platter. Not sure if many would eat it by itself but we preferred eating it with rice or veggies. Nonetheless, pleasant flavour comprised of a fried texture fused with sweetness. Watch out for the sharp fish pieces though. In terms of the fire shrimp, it was great! Came with live flames lol Personally, I'm not a fan of any food requiring work to get meat but this was worth it. After removing the shell/skin, it was goooood!  Overall, nothing blew me away taste-wise. It was decent food, ok prices, with a cool atmosphere. Would I come back? I'd say yes. I think I gotta try their other specials like grilled pork and chicken. Saw some people order them. Looked delicious. Next time!"}
{"text":"The fire shrimp was not spicy at all.  Too much sauce and not dry enough. The bbq pork was sooooo fat that we can only eat three slices. When we tried to flag the staff over to let them know, they tell us that the meat is like this. When I walked by the next table, they were not as fat. Anyways, overall disappointing experience for the price range and quality.  I think the management should stop pretending they care when they actually DON'T. I flagged two waitress down to advise them of how fat the bbq pork is, and after scrolling down I saw someone else mentioned that the bbq pork was too fat, again they will respond the same telling they will improve. Disappointing left, right and centre."}
{"text":"Went there with high expectations because its good reputation throughout China, but it disappointed me, long waiting time with the food served does not even worth the price, they can make much better than this, I am not sure if that is because of the food materials, anyway I won't go there again unless they make a large improvement."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to the delectable dishes of Green Tea when I was invited by Yelp to come check it out. I left impressed and remembered this was a good place to bring family cuz I knew my traditional 'rents would love the food and the feel of this place.   HOSPITALITY 7pm on Father's Day. Knowing how popular it is, I tried calling the night before to make a reservation for 4. I was informed that unfortunately they only take reservations for 7+ guests. I persisted a bit further over the phone and they were able to help me by putting my name down for said time, but will have to arrive 10min early to confirm my presence. When I arrived that day, I was handed #26, but indeed saw that my name had already been written at the #18 spot, so I was given that number instead (they were calling for #15). For the 7pm peak hour, I heard murmurs from the crowed that it was a 40min wait, but I only waited for 10min. Very accommodating, I thought. Appreciate it.  FOOD I reordered signature dishes that highlighted my night from the past Yelp Event:  * Dongpo Pork * Fried Chicken Wings in Salted Egg Yolk * Snow Pea Shoots  Additional orders that I really enjoyed: * Steamed Pumpkin with Sticky Rice  (quite unique, refreshing, sweet & savoury) * Braised Bamboo Shoots (sweet, crunchy)  I advised my table against the * Bread Temptation - it truly is a temptation - bc it looks nice, but not great to eat at all as it is nothing but hollow brick with scarce condensed milk inside. Don't disappoint yourself. You're better off getting a swirl from an ice cream truck :/  OVERALL IMPRESSION Contrary to the 2.5 star rating at the time of writing, I was pleased with the waiting service; their speed and methods. The food is so enjoyable, I did not care about the price point on this special day because I knew I was getting good food. My parents left satisfied and happy which is all I wanted that night. Will return or good food."}
{"text":"this place is in the same mall as sprouts on higley and southern i think it just opened It seams clean with a friendly but a non knowledgeable wait person I started off by ordering a iced green tea to be informed the do not have geen ice tea?????she brought me the lunch special menu but did not offer me the regular menu so i thought the menu she gave me was all the offered i had the 2 rolls spicy tuna and cali roll miso soup and a salad for 795 when i finished i ask her if they had pot stickers ...she repeated back to me pot sticker i said yes...ah dumplings, she said back to me dumplings ....yes ....she said no we have cheese filled wontons ...no thanks i said .so in a minute of brilliance she brought me the regular menu 1st item on menu under apps .......dumplings the owner/mngr who has not gone over the menu with his employs came to my table and asked me what i want i said the dumplings he then pointed to the picture and said these are the dumplings???????I KNOW ....so off he went to make them when she brought them out 7/8 minutes later she came back within 45 seconds and sir don't eat them there not done yet..........WOW REALLY i then informed them they may keep there dumplings and wished them good luck in there business pursuits all that said i will give them another try the food and the  regular menu looked like some good options"}
{"text":"So I checked out Green Tea Restaurant today for the first time. I have a few things to say and I'm not gonna sugar coat it.  Service- We walked in and woman behind the counter was nice but than became a total jerk. She didn't thank us, She was very rude and no personality what so ever. Than when it came time to pay just got more rude.  Environment- The restaurant seemed clean when we walked in but sat down at both and the menus were so gross. They had not been cleaned in months maybe even years. The table was clean, as was the silverware.   Price and food- The food was HORRIBLE! I ordered the \"curry chicken\" and it was mostly veggies maybe 4 or 5 small pieces of chicken was in it. I ended up taking some of my mom's from her. She ordered sesame orange chicken and they bathed the chicken in the sesame seeds.   The only good thing about this place was Wong Tong soup. but one bad part about Wong Tong soup was the Wong Tongs were stale and not crunchy at all.   1 star god i wish I could give this half a star. I will not be eating here ever again  Also it says free Wi-Fi on the window but they are really stealing it from the Taco Shop on the corner next door."}
{"text":"I guess everyone's experience is different so I can only base my rating on the experience I had... I was very pleased with the flavor of my food. I ordered the Kung pao chicken lunch with fried rice and the hot and sour soup. What surprised me was that the fried rice was a Pork fried rice and not just egg like most of the other places around here. The Kung pao chicken was also very flavorful. I would have to say that my service was good as well. I'm glad I decided to give this place a try after reading all the negative reviews so I could make my own decision."}
{"text":"this is a very popular chain in china, and i suppose this is why it has such a large crowd in toronto. the reviews however are pretty accurate, most of the food is average at best, and definitely not worth the price you pay, and also not worth the wait times. of the 5 things we ordered, only the duck soup was really decent. the pork belly was flavourless fat, placed on a hot plate that was not hot. the lotus root was too hard considering that the dish is supposed to be softer and sweet, the eggplant is too oily, although the taste is generally okay. the spicy skewer pot doesn't have a lot of flavour outside of just pure spicy.   overall they can do thing average not great, and definitely not amazing, so i don't think its worth the time and effort to go again or try. The service is spotty at best, as it is pretty hard to flag down a waiter to get their attention. I think they really need to improve on flavour and portions of their dishes, as most dishes portions weren't that big, but most of the problem is just it wasn't that exceptional. it is the same food you could eat at any other restaurant for much lower price, and no aggravation.  i wouldn't recommend anyone waste the time to try it, as it is nothing special. the ratings reflect how disappointing its been, considering this is a really popular place in china and seems to be much better in china"}
{"text":"very bad service. Won't go again!!! We went there according to its famous reputation in China. However, the dishes was very disappointing. We ordered pepper fish head. It cost 29.99 for that dish. But it just came only half fish head with just bone but no fish. Can you believe that? 29.99 for the price I could definitely go to red lobster to get a main dish. So not worth it. The boss there is crazy to set the price so high.   Trust me!! Never ever order the pepper fish head,people!! We also ordered bacon bamboo rice. It's not the kind that I had in China. Just plain rice with few pieces bacon on top. It cost 9.99. So crazy!! Overall, we have three people ordered 4 dishes  spent 85bucks total. We finished all but not feel full. Dish very small. The manager charged the tip by himself. I gave him 100, give me just 10 back and said to me tip is not included. I complained to the manager about the fish head. He didn't feel sorry at all but argued that I'm just not lucky enough to get a big fish head. It's so ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE  Ordered online delivery.  Food arrived hot and fresh and was good.  The delivery speed was outstanding as well, about 25 min from online order to front door delivery.    However, ran into an issue where we were supposed to receive a complimentary egg roll with each order over $25.  We did not receive our egg roll which left one of our party not receiving one.    I phoned the restaurant, and explained our issue.  The woman who answered the phone stated in a condescending tone that because not everyone wants a free egg roll, (really?) customers need to request one when they order online!  I explained that no where on their site do they say that.  The woman replied again that customers who want the free egg roll need to ask for it and refused to resolve the issue.  Wow, are you kidding me?    When you offer a complimentary item for qualifying orders, you should automatically include it or at least provide instructions on your website for your customers that if they want the free item, they must request it.   It's unethical and as a result, is poor customer service to your patrons."}
{"text":"Very unorganized! Some servers don't know what they are doing. Terrible attitude! We ordered BBQ pork, it was all fat, barely any lean meat. It is super greasy, oily and disgusting. I asked the waiter if I can change it to something else, he asked the manager and came back saying no. I went up to the counter and talked to the manager. He basically blamed me for not advising the waiter what I dislike. The menu is unclear, it only says barbecue pork, didn't specify it is pork belly meat. In the end, he agreed to change the dish but continued saying it was my fault. Not impressed with this kind of service. The green tea pancake was not good. The lamb and beef was not bad though.  Reply to the owner's comment: the burner was barely adding any heat to the dish. We waited for at least 20 minutes and the fat and grease was going nowhere. I tried one it was just super greasy and not crisp at all!  If it supposed to be crispy then the dish I got definitely had a quality issue. You should not blame your customer for not liking super fatty meat!"}
{"text":"We came to the Green Tea restaurant to see what the hype is all about. Apparently, this chain restaurant in China always has long line-ups and seems like they wanted to recreate that hysteria by offering 50% off on opening day. Well seems like they got their wish, but judging by the number of initial 1-star reviews, looks like the cooks/staff weren't quite ready to handle the large crowd on their first day. Restaurants have soft-openings for a reason...  I've been here twice already and overall am quite satisfied with the food quality, taste, price, and service. Here is a summary of what I've tried so far in my two visits:  - A01 BBQ pork ($16.99). This dish is over-rated. It's quite fatty, but not nearly as tender as the typical char-siu you get at a place like Skyview or Dragonboat. Would skip.  - A03 Teppanyaki Green Bass ($22.99). This has got to be the smallest bass I've seen, and it's quite pricey. But the fish is crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and tastes very good. Recommended.   - B01 Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs ($11.99). The pork ribs are quite meaty and covered in this wonderfully balanced tangy and vinegary sweet and sour sauce. Absolutely delicious! Highly recommended.   - C12 Fried Tiger Shrimp with XO Sauce ($23.99). The shrimp was nice and plump and the XO sauce was quite light and not spicy at all. Good but nothing special. Ok, but would rather get two plates of the S&S ribs instead of this.   - C20 Deep Fried Boneless Chicken Wing Stuffed with Shrimp ($7.99 each). Only taste shrimp paste and not much chicken. Ok, but not great. Would skip.   - C24 Braised Beef Brisket with Tomato and Potato ($17.99). Lots of tomatoes and potatoes, but not much beef. The quality of the beef brisket isn't that great either. Would skip.   - C36 Sauteed Eggplant with Minced Pork ($13.99). Super soft and melts in your mouth goodness. Really nice black bean sauce that isn't overly salty. This dish is awesome! Highly recommended.   - E01 Green Tea Pancake ($11.99). One of the only dishes with green tea in it. Comes warm with taro paste inside and coated with sesame seeds. Very tasty. Recommended.   This restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a really nice atmosphere. Depending on where in the restaurant you sit, you may not get any cellular reception (may have something to do with all the metal decorations used as wall partitions). The servers are all friendly, patient, and helpful in explaining the menu. The food service is also quite fast.   My only complaint would be that the green tea is served luke-warm (both times we came). Also for a restaurant with green tea in its name, I was expecting to see some innovative green tea inspired dishes, which the menu is lacking. I'm also not a fan of the whole VIP card thing where you get a slight cash discount if you buy the $20 card. It's yet another card to keep in your wallet! But, since I like the place and plan on continuing to come back, we got the card and already made up the cost in savings. Great restaurant addition to First Markham Place!"}
{"text":"I went with my fiancé for Sunday lunch. We were really surprised about the price they charge for each dish!   We had green tea BBQ pork, the thousand year egg with tofu and wonton in Chicken broth. The food is nothing special at all. But the total amount is $40 something. The wonton in chicken broth has a lot of msg(Monosodium glutamate), and green tea BBQ pork is nothing related to great tea at all, it does not have green tea tastes! Moreover the presentation of thousand year egg with tofu is really unique but you can just make it at home nothing really special.  However, the restaurant has a really elegant traditional Chinese design from the lighting fixtures to the furniture selections.   The waitresses are being really friendly and polite. I am really surprised about the quality of the service here! Because usually Chinese restaurant has a huge issue on the customer service. I would willing to give 2 stars for this restaurant for the customer service but they need some improvements on each dish."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new to try and came up upon this restaurant on the blogTO. From the photos and review we decided it was worth a try. Green Tea restaurant is located in FMP which can be very busy, especially on weekends. Get there early for better parking.   We called in to get a reservation for 6:00pm for 6 people. When we got there we were told that they don't take reservations for less than 8 people!  There was already a bunch of people waiting in the doorway and the restaurant was full. I told the lady that I had called at 12 that afternoon and was told that \"6 people at 6:00 was fine.\"  I also said that I spoke to a guy since the person who answered the phone spoke Mandarin and she handed me off to a guy. Well, she then said, \"You spoke to a guy?  There's only one guy that works here. I'll check with him.\"  Luckily that guy confirmed that he did take our reservation and we got the next available table.   We took the advice from the blog and tried the pig stomach soup which was very flavourful (but super heavy on the white pepper).   We also tried the sticky rice lotus which is a cold dish and was quite tasty and sweet.   Two \"signature\" dishes: crispy chicken and bbq pork (not the typical Cantonese style) came on hot plates/grills that kept the meat hot. The chicken was crispy and came with a few dipping \"sauces\". It was a hit with the kids. The pork was more like pork belly that was salted?  It was too salty for my taste.   In Chinese ?????? literally translates into \"My super vermicelli\" was super yummy!  The kids love noodles and the name just drew my attention.   For dessert we just had to try the giant bread with ice cream on top. I've never seen this before and so we were enticed to give it a try. It is this giant loaf that takes 20 mins to make after ordering so plan ahead if you decide to order it. From first glance it just looks like a loaf that has been hollowed out, re-stuffed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it. Our party looked at it and decided that it was best to take the ice cream off and divide the insides. A closer inspection revealed several layers of \"cubed\" bread with a sweet butter melted on it (honey maybe?). Anyhow, it was delicious!  Overall I would have to say that given the food taste and quantity, I find it quite pricey for Chinese food. The bill for two kids and four adults came to just over $100 (before tip).  We did not buy their $20 \"membership card\" which gets you the lower price for all the dishes ($2 each dish). The service was so-so as we had asked for a communal pair of chopsticks and they never came, extra sharing bowls which also never came and we had to help ourselves to them from the shelf. For the dessert, it only came with two forks (for 6 people) and so we had to ask again and they gave us plastic forks! (Remember every plastic fork you've ever used is STILL out there somewhere!) We had to ask for the bill twice as the kids were getting antsy (past their bedtime).   We originally planned to make a decision in the card after we tried the food. We didn't buy it. Not sure if we'll come back?"}
{"text":"My parents and I decided to try this place out on recommendation from a friend. My expectations were low given the average ratings on Yelp.  The things that we ordered were BBQ chicken, seared eggplant, and fired rice with BBQ pork. BBQ chicken came first with the half chicken on a elevated hot plate where the burner would keep it warm. The chicken itself was nice and tender.   The seared eggplant was surprisingly good considering that I am not a big fan of the veggie. The sauce though was a bit too salty so advice is not to let the eggplant swim and soak up the sauce.  Lastly, we had the fried rice which was more for carbs than anything. It was not too large in portion and it was just average in my opinion. Overall, it was a good experience with excellent service. Keep in mind that most of the staff are more comfortable in Mandarin. The restaurant was full during the Friday lunch rush so make sure you call for reservations or arrive early."}
{"text":"On vacation and was looking for some fast Chinese food to take out. Didn't have time yelp.. But, ended up here. I wish I did yelp before heading inside here.   Was greeted by a 12 year old boy playing his gameboy or something like that? Then, we approach the counter for a menu and were greeted by a not so friendly 20 year girl. Probably the owners daughter?   I place my order for 6 people.. And spent about $60 worth of food! Then, I saw a coupon for free sesame chicken if you spent more then $50 dollars. Bought it to the girl attention and she got a bit rude.   The food wasn't all that. It was a bit bland. I wish it was more authentic, and not so chewy. They provide you with a lot of meat.. But, not enough rice for 6 people, a tiny portion! The inside of the restaurant was a bit clean and it was empty? Who knows? But, the reviews on here are definitely true.   Food- 2 out 5  Service- 1 out 5 Cleanliness- 3 out of 5"}
{"text":"Roach in the restaurant! And server stepped on it and just pushed it aside, nasty!! Never again!  She didn't even apologize or mention the roach."}
{"text":"Very nice place with excellent service, good decor and ambiance.   As per suggestions here we ordered the Sweet and Sour pork lion and was absolutely delighted-great!    We also ordered the Peppered Chicken-strange name but tastes great!  It has a nice kick to it so dang be silly and drink the soup base.     They have a VIP card that will grant you the privilege of paying the lower price on the menu.  The cost is $20 which is typical for this concept.  The nice thing is they let you put it on your bill but the two year expiry date is silly in my opinion.  We bought the VIP card and will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most comfortable chinese cuisine I have been to. While other chinese cuisine slam their dishes with oil and greese, this is a place where food is taken seriously.  Service is not too fond. We called our server several time for one thing and our drinks came after we were full. I guess the staff is still new and the sense of organization is not strong yet."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out right next to the Sprouts I shop at. The first time I went, I had the chicken and vegetables. Nothing too great, but good. The second time I got the moo goo gai pan. Not only was it the most tasteless chinese food I've ever had, but the most tasteless dish I've ever had anywhere! Blah! I'm not going back. The dishes are very cheap price wise, so in this case you get what you pay for. The restaurant could also use a deep cleaning. These average chinese restaurants are a dime a dozen. They've got to put some flavor in their food. I hope they read their reviews and can make changes. Hate to see anybody lose their business."}
{"text":"I have been going to Green Tea for a decade at least.  I believe it is the best Chinese Food I have ever had.  It is a restaurant seating a fair number but I always pick-up via take-out. They use quality food and it does not taste overly greasy. The egg rolls, spring rolls, Chilli Chicken, Beef in Black Bean sauce, chicken balls and noodles are my typical take-out order.  The chilli chicken is nice and spicy and my favourite dish.  The chicken balls are full of meat and not greasy like most Chinese restaurants. Lastly, the owner is tremendously friendly and outgoing. Love it."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Chinese place out here in Mesa for a long time. It looks like we found it.   We have ordered twice from here and both times the food was on time and was very good. We have tried their orange chicken which is as good or better than anywhere else I have had it, their chow mein which was better than I have had it anywhere else, their Tofu which was again delicious and finally their Kung Pao chicken.   You get alot of food for a good price and it comes hot! Try these guys out and hopefully you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Must Order the Fire shrimp!!! It tasted amazing! Great family place with children. The prices are average around $20-$30 a person. When you order, the food comes quickly. Great alternative family Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Fancy! And cool decor!  Host was nice, and servers were friendly.  Clean and very nice atmosphere.  Food ==== Signature fried Chicken: - Crispy skin - Juicy meat - Kept warm by a hot platter that somehow did not drive out the chicken ... - Tasty!  And loved the selection of dipping sauces with exception to the pumpkin sauce.  Pumpkin sauce had no flavour :(  Lotus Root: Yum! But it's expensive!  This was a sweet & cold dish.  It made a nice appetizer but boy was it expensive for what you get.  Dipped Skewers: The sauce was good, the skewers seemed fine but somehow it didn't come together.  It's the sauce didn't have enough time to really get into the skewers?  Maybe it's dipped to order?  But the inside of the skewers are a bit bland and the sauce is suppose to make up for it but it's not like you can double / triple dip the sauce so it kinda drips away and you're left with skewers with insufficient seasoning.  Would we come back? ================= Yes!  They have a huge menu and I definite want to come back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"Semi new restaurant at FMP thought I'd give it a try serving Hangzhaou dishes of southern China the menu has two prices to get the lower price you need to get their  VIP card.  Sat. lunch before 12 no line up service was prompt server reco some popular dishes like duck soup and stir fry lamb.  All in all the food was good but pretty expensive for a Chinese restaurant even at the VIP pricing."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad (Chix fried rice & pork gyoza). They charged me for a large rice for take out  and only got a small, at least I hope it wasn't the large!  I think there might be a bit of a communication issue here. Also, Japanese or Chinese but not both please."}
{"text":"The service was good and the environment was fine, but that's about it. However, I would never go back to this place again. The food was just wrong. We ordered 5 dishes (including dessert) among two people, didn't like any of them."}
{"text":"Despite what you may think of the low ratings on yelp, this restaurant is packed every day. I don't feel it is right that some of the ratings were given not for the food but because some people couldn't get a seat or table during the restaurant first day opening. Since the grand opening, the restaurant has actively worked on improving on service and sitting people effectively.  Green tea wanted to create a word of mouth buzz but in the end, it didn't even need to offer 50% on opening day as people have been flocking every night, even willing to wait over an hour for a table!  Green tea is expensive compared to other Chinese establishments and their dishes are not very big. However, not much restaurants offer hangzhou cuisine, something you don't see often in the GTA.   I been there twice with a group of 9 people. Each time, we ordered about 9-10 dishes to share. A lot of dishes I enjoyed while others were nothjng special such as the bread with ice cream. It was literally just toasted bread and ice cream! I have yet to try everything but so far so good but the dishes size could be bigger.  Cost with vip card came about $20 to $25 per person. Vip card is $20 and is good for two years. I think it is totally worth it. The card each time helped me and my friends saved $20 off dinner.  Parking can be a nightmare at fmp so come early or park far.  The Restaurant is well designed and is very pretty. Lots of 2 to 4 people tables and only four big round tables that can sit up to 10 people.There are big private room at the room at the back but need to spend a minimum of $300 to sit there.  Don't be reluctant to try this place."}
{"text":"Lovely place that's close, tasty, and reasonably priced.  Not to mention how easy it is to order off the yelp app."}
{"text":"Poor service, food was definitely not worth the money. Way overpriced! And waitress was not accommodating in terms of changing our order when we just ordered about 1 minute ago. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service. Something for everyone on the menu. The wait isn't so bad, and it's worth getting in on the hype around this chain in China! Favourite dishes are the pumpkin sticky rice and thousand year old egg tofu."}
{"text":"Great take out, sweet staff. Very delicious Egg Foo. Also killer egg rolls. And it is all next door to my house."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend at 1pm and was  surprised there wasn't any line up like the previous weeks.   The menu was very interesting and I'm glad they have pictures to show what the food looks like.  Here's what we ordered: Signature bbq pork: tasted like chasu that you get at other bbq places, but more expensive.  Fried rice: didn't like this, way too oily and no other meat with the rice. I wouldn't recommend this to elderly people. Fried oyster pancake: this was surprisingly good. Big chunks of oyster and crispy dough (although also very oily).  Green tea: considering it's called Green Tea restaurant, I would expect their green tea to taste better. But it was very bland and tasted like it's been in the pot that has been constantly watered down.  Overall this place is ok. They do have a lot of interesting items on their menu that make me want to come again. But it's definitely overpriced and very oily for elderly customers."}
{"text":"11:13 placed order 12:40 table is still empty After seeing people who ordered later than me already have the food,i went up to the front desk and ask for my food. I am not the only person who got frustrated with this terrible service.  Food is very average. There are more restaurants which have better food and also serves food within a reasonable time!  Tip: how to get ur food? Just go to the desk and showed ur angry face to one of the waitress and make ur complain. Your food will be ready within 10min!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is the place's great atmosphere. It's very clean. You're greeted by friendly service, who are happy to serve you; they were glad to take our photo. Other than the electrical cord hanging on the floor below my seat, the setting was agreeable.  Which is why it was a rather profound disappointment to be served with food of fluctuating quality. The pork was too dry and stiff, and the lotus roots a tad too sweet, while the rice cakes were surprisingly good."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place.  I came here twice. First time it was great, I came for dinner and while I had to wait a long time and the food was on the pricey side for Chinese food, the food tasted great and we could taste the difference in quality. The ppl place was super packed but we got our food quite quickly.  First time we ordered, we had: sweet and sour pork - ok Fire shrimp - so fresh, and flavorful, outside is crispy and inside is juicy Signature BBQ pork - Steven liked it, although it was a little salty for my preferences Lotus root sticky rice - cooked to perfection, nice big chunks, and could taste the flower honey  After a week I came again, it was because I wanted to take my mom to a nice Chinese restaurant for lunch. It was way less busy this time, there were many empty tables. So there really shouldn't be any reason for a decrease in quality since the chefs wouldn't be rushed. Yet this time, the food quality dropped. I wonder what (if there is any) quality control is used here?  This time we ordered, we had: Fire shrimp - it was soggy this time and the insides were noticeably not fresh (the texture was not succulent and reeked of seafood that's been left out for too long). What happened???  Stir fried wood fungus with Chinese yam - this was our first time ordering this dish, but they used the cheap kind of Chinese yam. Given the quality of this restaurant I experienced last time, I expected them to use the proper type of Chinese yam, but seems like they will still try to cut costs wherever they can. A little bit of background, the good quality Chinese yam will have the texture similar to a boiled potato. The cheap kind will be crispy in texture and be slightly slimy. And no, stir frying would not change this difference.  Lotus root sticky rice - the pieces were noticeably smaller this time yet undercooked (the root was still crispy). How did they manage to undercook smaller pieces of the same thing when they have more time to prepare???   Needless to say my mom and I were very disappointed with our visit. I don't want to gamble on the quality of the food here again."}
{"text":"Good decor. Good service. Food was ready very soon. However the taste is mediocre, and the price/quality ratio is rather low in my opinion. I'm a native Chinese but was disappointed by this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food from Green Tree. I typically get egg drop soup and cashew chicken both of which are really good. I gave them 4 stars because I wish I would have received more rice with my large cashew chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick-up. Menu has a large variety of options... we ordered a ton of sushi rolls and they were all very fresh. Also the miso soup is to die for. Ordered some steamed dumplings, they were really big and good too. Overall, would visit again... but bring lots of money because they're a little on the pricy side!"}
{"text":"I love the food but the owners are very Rude. I made a mistake on my order called back to see if I could correct it and she told me no the order is on the way. Well I live 2 minutes from the restaurant and it's been 30 minutes and still no food. I over look the rude attitudes because of the food but this has really made me not want to go back. They do not care about the patron."}
{"text":"Green Tea is a popular chain from Hangzhou, China, serving regional specialties such as dongpo pork, sweet & sour fish, and fried meat dishes. Lots of bold flavours; dishes are on the heavier side. Décor is pretty nice, in ancient China style.   Cash, Debit & WeChat payment accepted.   The menu has pricing for members and non-members.   I had:  - Chicken soup - very good, but very strong on the pepper. I prefer the stewed duck & bamboo - Wintermelon - Pork ribs - good sugar & vinegar sauce, meat is a bit dry though - Salted egg chicken wings - absolute fav. skin is crispy, meat is so juicy & moist. Each piece is covered in egg yolk - may be too much for some"}
{"text":"Good service, serving in minutes. Great taste but it is a bit pricy."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here a few weeks back and I have to say it was amazing. I've been getting tired of the Chinese restaurant near my house and wanted to try something different. I ordered through grub hub, which was very easy and convenient. However I didn't enjoy the rude phone call I received from the restaurant wanting to know what apartment number I lived in - I live in a house. In very broken English she was yelling down the phone some address which wasn't mine. I corrected her and the food showed up about 15 minutes later. The rude lady on the phone was the only reason why I didn't give this review more stars."}
{"text":"I am very impressed by Green Tea restaurant. We have a group of 3 people, we dined at the restaurant for lunch on a Tuesday. No need to make r serration if you come for weekday lunch. We ordered 4 dishes, all of them are at least 8/10. I have eaten at Green Tea in China. I am surprised at the consistency of the flavours of all the dishes, they taste exactly like what I had in China!!!! Braised pork belly is superb, 10/10. It was really tender and full of flavours. I think it is cooked in low heat for at least 5 hours. We also order the \"spicy numb chicken\", 8/10, very tasty, they use the pepper that numbs the tongue, very authentic!!! Another dish we had was organic cauliflower, 9/10. My dad and I really love all the food we had at Green Tea. We got the membership card, we will definitely come back very often! Another thing to note, they serve food very fast!!!!!! Faster than any sit down restaurant I've ever been to. Also service was very attentive!"}
{"text":"My mom was excited to have a Chinese restaurant nearby, where she can go, or have delivery. The restaurant was at the west end of the Sprouts complex. The outside window wording was strange to me \"Cook fresh Eat Fresh\". Hmm, ok. The interior was cold, empty and lacking vision. It seemed haphazardly put together. A south bar served no purpose, and held several ripped up cardboard boxes with condiment packets. There was a flyswatter hanging on the wall behind it. Classy. There was a table and a few north booths. What looked like an old menu board above the cashier counter was wrapped with paper panda photos. The chairs squeaked like crazy, and felt like they would fall apart at any moment. I ordered the lunch orange chicken with lo mein for my mom, and a small egg drop soup for myself. At $10, it wasn't bad. The order came out very quickly. But, I was the only one in there. I also made note that there was no health department grade posted in the restaurant. The lady at the counter was very short with me and unfriendly. She did allow for the noodles to be substituted for rice, which was nice. My mother loved her food. She likes very plain Jane food, and said that it was great. My soup was like sipping on whisked egg yolks. It was hot, but had no flavor. There weren't large pieces of egg, just small pieces like it was beaten before it was dropped into the water or broth. While my mom will undoubtedly order from here again, I won't."}
{"text":"I am still waiting to see if if crooked dump closes down, rude service and dishes are watered down with plenty of veggies and NO Meat, the ole bait and switch!! Don't waste your money here!!"}
{"text":"I've been mislead by its name; I thought it serves food and tea with matcha. LOL   Our server told us that this restaurant is a very popular chain in China serving fusion Hangzhou cuisine.  Our server is friendly and cheerful; and the service is excellent.  Nice décor with dim lightning.  We had the barbecue pork and fried rice cake with shredded pork.  The barbecue pork is made from pork belly; the lean and fat portion is pretty good.  Rice cake is delicious.  There are two prices for each dish; the red is membership price (Membership is $20 for two years).  *They don't take reservation except for groups of eight or more people*"}
{"text":"Very poor seating arrangement on the soft opening day.  It could have done better if the lady use a paper grid system to show how many people for each waiting number.  We asked her what is the next waiting number and she randomly call a number she is unsure of.  Nobody know what's going on but just wait wait and wait.  Some got very frustrated and end up leaving.  Upon us leaving, we saw a few empty tables but the server unwilling to assign people to those tables.  I am not sure if the restaurant try to create hype (a crowd outside the door) but does not want people to seat quickly  because of the special 50% off pricing on the soft opening day."}
{"text":"Green Tea Restaurant is a recognized brand with over 50 locations in China. In fact, it is common for guests to be waiting in line for up to 2-3 hours in order to get a table. Specializing in authentic Hangzhou food, Toronto is getting its first Landmark Southern Chinese Restaurant.   We got to try quite a few dishes and I would say 2 must get dishes would be the Barbecue Pork and Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs. For soup, a good recommendation would be the Boiled Chicken and Pig Tripe with White Pepper in Broth. Finally for dessert go for the Bread Temptation or for something more traditional  try the Green Tea Pancake.  Price is not set yet but you're looking at approximately $25 per person."}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE PLACE I HAVE EVER HAD. Before I went vegan, gluten free this was my favourite place. I had been eating there for over 10 years. The food is jaw dropping amazing. When I was a little girl, I use to say I wanted them the cater my wedding when I was a grown up. I've always loved the food."}
{"text":"I think 2 stars overall is a little harsh for this place. It's certainly no 4-star dining, but I found the food to be overall decent here.  Green Tea Restaurant was my second dinner stop in my 3-week trip back to the GTA. My parents have been here previously and did acknowledge that the December 8th reviews were accurate in terms of organization and speed, but apparently they got better as time went on. Some teething issues remained though, including their weird numbering scheme when waiting for a table.  I had the barbecue chicken, bread temptation, beef temptation, fire shrimp, and the deep fried boneless chicken wings stuffed with shrimp. I liked the beef temptation and the boneless chicken wings, but nothing else really stood out. The fire shrimp wasn't anything more than shrimp skewers unfortunately.  Service can definitely be improved, but it seemed better than the grand opening reviews. Not sure if I'll return here...maybe if future reviews showed a marked improvement in the food quality and service."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday afternoon. No workers in restaurant, except a child playing in one of the booths. Stood at the counter for 2 mins and no one came out to greet me. I should have left but I was hungry. I grabbed a menu and sat in one of the booths to wait. 5 mins, still no greet. Mind you there is a bell on the door when I came in.  I asked the playing child if anyone is working, she ran to the back and finally someone came out. 20ish year old girl and first thing she says \"do you know what you want\".  I said, 'finally ...someone comes out to greet' with a smirk. She did not seem amused or bothered and proceeds with taking my order. I asked for iced tea and shrimp in garlic sauce.  Ok....this is why this restaurant gets one star.  As she walks away, she takes the napkin in her left hand and blows her nose till she cleared all her boogers. Not once did I see her wash her hands. After she blew her nose she got my drink and was holding it close to the lip of the glass with her left hand. 3 mins later she carries out my food holding the lip of the plate with that same left hand.  Of course I mention the nastiness I just witnessed and told her it was disgusting. Do not eat here...ITS GROSS!!!! **I left to eat a sprouts sandwich next door. Everyone there was wearing gloves and hairnets**"}
{"text":"Despite the not so great reviews me and a group of friends still want to give this place a try. And luckily we did. I think this place deserves a higher rating. Price is definitely not cheap. But at $23.50 a person with vip pricing, I think it's fair. Food is delicious even though the portion is not as big. We didn't try any dish with fish so can't really comment on that. Otherwise the meats and vegetables are pretty good. Tips: make sure to reserve a table first, if not it's a pretty long line up. Also the vip card is $20 but last for two years."}
{"text":"Service not the greatest on a Thu evening. Had to get up n get the menu myself n tea hasn't been served yet.  Have they forgotten us"}
{"text":"Pros: Dishes you can't find just anywhere  Cons: Super long wait times Value not there  Green Tea Restaurant is a popular chain in China that's made it's way over to Toronto.  If I've been told correctly, they specialize in cuisine from Hangzhou.  I remember passing by the day they opened and the line up was ridiculous.  Finally had a chance to try it and give my take on it.  First off, they do reservations.  I highly recommend getting a reservation.  If you don't have one, be prepared for wait times of more than an hour easily on the weekend.  I remember seeing someone waiting when I arrived at around 6pm, and still seeing that person waiting at 730.  That's nuts.  If you read my reviews, you know I don't think anything is worth waiting that long for.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  There are 4 round tables in the middle which can probably seat about 8 people.  The sides are lined with booths that fit 4, though you can probably squeeze 6 if you tried hard enough.  There are some very small tables for 2.  I don't recommend coming here for 2 honestly.  You will most certainly get the small table and they don't have much room.  You put 2 dishes on the tables and there's not much room for anything else.  There is also a private room but there is a $380 minimum charge to book the room.  Looking at the menu, they have some unique items I have never seen in other Chinese restaurants.  I do like how they have pictures of a lot of their dishes.  We chose a number of dishes to try as this was our first time.  The dishes come out pretty quickly after you order which is nice.  They were all prepared fairly well and tasted just as good.  My gripe is the portion sizes didn't seem to fit the price you were paying.  Dishes range from $10 to $30 here.  You can easily spend hundreds of dollars here and still not end up full if you're a big eater.  If you like trying new things, give this place a try.  Just book a reservation in advance.  I was OK with this place in general.  With the prices though, I don't see myself coming here again anytime soon. There is a VIP card for $20 a year which lets you save 2 or 3 dollars off the regular price but even then I still think the prices are not worth it."}
{"text":"Even though I gave them my address and cross streets, the delivery guy was completely incapable of finding where I live. An hour after I ordered, I got a call telling me that the order had been canceled. If you can't master the major cross streets in a 2 or 3 mile radius, you have no business passing yourself off as a delivery restaurant."}
{"text":"They aren't the nicest here but their food is super good. I'm from the east coast and they have the most authentic east coast Asian cuisine. My favorite is the pork fried rice which never disappoints. I saw that some people had issues ordering from Grubhub. I usually use eat24 and my experience is always great. Usually about a 20 minute time for me to pick up my food and it's always hot and ready for me when I arrive. I am seriously confused as to why this place has such a low rating."}
{"text":"If something doesn't taste good to you then you have your own tastes, but I can't help but feel some of the other reviewers here have skewed expectations on what their food is \"supposed\" to taste like.  Can't comment for everything on the menu but everything I tried here was really delicious. I went with my family and we got the recommended pork chops, a very large steamed fish soup dish, pea sprouts (??) and the mochi. The flavours are all simple but well done. The pork chops have a lot of bones but this isn't a problem to me when it comes to Chinese pork chops. They were the right mix of crispy and chewy and had great flavour in every bite. The fish soup was expensive but amazing. Pea sprouts were solid, hard to mess up there but good for such a simple dish. The mochi is not supposed to have anything in it and is sweet and simple. (It's like Korean injeolmi/)  The service is honestly great if you can speak Chinese - staff are very sociable and eager to explain menu items.  It's definitely on the expensive side but no more than your average Italian or other European cuisine restaurant in Toronto. It may or may not be worth the long line-ups - maybe try and check it out during off-hours if possible."}
{"text":"The kung pao chicken and shrimp was very good normally however the wait time for dine-in is a little excessive they seem to have most of their business come from take-out."}
{"text":"Ya food is just average. Although I think it's just new store hence the disorganization. Hopefully things get better for them soon. At least we were able to get some good Bingsu at cups right beside it after dinner.  Restored my mood hence the 1 star."}
{"text":"The chicken pieces had lots of gristle.  Service was good, as were the prices; but, we all were totally disgusted by the chicken. (We spit more into our napkins than swallowed!) We did enjoy the egg rolls and the wonton soup."}
{"text":"My first impression was that this place was really nice.  Kind of rustic traditional Chinese decor.  Tables of 4 get to sit in semi private stalls while parties larger get a nice circular bench around a table.  All around very nice place.  Green Tea Chicken, has no green tea in it, but its a name like Nando's chicken.  Crispy skin, always warm as its on a hot plate.  Comes with different dipping options, very good.  Not mind blowing but good.  Beef and Tripe in spicy sauce (cold app).  This was pretty good though the sauce had a bit of sourness to it.  Not what I was use to but still good.  Fried fish in honey sauce.  This one you have to watch out for because it was not what i expected.  I read the English and thought I was getting as it says, fried fish but its more accurately...fried and dried fish mixed with sweet sauce, its a cold app, and it has tons of bones which you are expected to actually chew through and eat.  Was it good? yes, its pretty good but it was unexpected.  I have a feeling that if I could read name in Chinese I would know what to expect.  So watch out, this would freak out those who have never seen bones in fish before...you know who you are.    Service was great as they were very courteous and took care of my leftovers that I took to go.  A bit on the pricy side, expect to shell out at least 25 even for a lunch but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This is my go to delivery spot. All comes hot and in a timely manner. Food is always tasty as well."}
{"text":"This place has some descent dishes but also some not so memorable ones. The \"grilled sea bass\" was a little misleading as it was either pan seared or deep fried first, then plated onto a grill for serving. Peanut covered moshi was boring. Pig stomach soup was good as was the stir fried lamb slices.  Service was pretty good, no complaints here. Food came at a steady pace, and servers were responsive and well trained.   Dining room was full from 8pm-930pm with the occasional short wait for a few.   Not bad but not great"}
{"text":"Had a small meal of Shanghai noodles and beef and brocolli. Noodles were very good but a bit salty, and the rest was very good. The place was empty and service was good. Good price as well."}
{"text":"For the amount of food you get and the quality of how it's made, the food here at Green Tea Restaurant is overpriced and not worth it. We ordered the Steamed Lotus Root ($8.99), Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs ($11.99), Fried Rice with BBQ Pork ($9.99) and Mochi in Brown Sugar ($7.99).   The Steamed Lotus Root is a dish of 9 lotus root slices that are slightly sweet. It arrived lukewarm and if they expect you to believe it's $1 per slice then that is ridiculous. The flavour is one-dimensional.   The plate of pork ribs is underwhelming for $11.99 because you don't get that much. The flavours are about what you'd expect, but it's more bone than meat. For some pieces it's just the bone and no meat; not sure what happened there.  The fried rice is literally just one bowl of rice turned upside down on a plate. The presentation is sloppy, and you get more vegetables than meat.   The Mochi in Brown Sugar ($7.99) was eight clumps of mochi dusted, with enough brown sugar syrup to dip four of them in. The mochi is plain-tasting and doesn't have anything inside. It was very tough to eat with just the mochi. This was starred as being recommended on the menu, but I don't know how that is possible.  Overall if they reduced the prices for each of the dishes we ordered by $3 then I'd say it's worth it. At the end of our meal, the ladies' washroom also began to overflow and water began to leak out and into the restaurant. The washroom floor was covered in water, and our table was the closest one there. So that didn't exactly inspire confidence either."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in tonight's service. We have eaten here a handful of times using both carry-out and delivery.  Tonight I placed an order through Grubhub. (The Grubhubapp is fantastic, by the way.) Delivery from Gree Tea in the past has usually been pretty speedy. Tonight...not so much. My order was placed at 6:25 PM. I received a text at 6:44 PM stating my food was on the way. I live about 1.5 miles from the restaurant so I was surprised when 7:20 PM rolled around and still hadn't received our order. (The estimated delivery time was 7:05 to 7:15.) At 7:20 I called the restaurant to inquire about our order. I was rudely told that they are busy and it would be delivered in 40 to 45 minutes. I asked if she meant an ADDITIONAL 45 minutes to which she responded \"Yes.\" When I told her that that doesn't  make sense since I received the text stating that my food was already on the way  over 30 minutes ago and it's already 5 minutes past the originally stated delivery time. Then she told me they were heading out the door with my food as we speak. I confirmed that she said the food was on the way NOW. She said \"Yes.\" So I said \"Ok.\" Then waited another 35 minutes for the food to reach my door 1.5 miles away from the restaurant. I can understand that they can be pretty busy on a Friday night. A simple  call to say \"I'm sorry but we need some extra time for delivery\" would have been appreciated. I could have given my kids a snack to hold them over. We had waited so long that I LITERALLY told my sister to take Mc D's orders and went back to my bedroom to get ready to run out to Mc D's to grab dinner. Then at 7:50 the doorbell rang. I was simply going to write the money off as a loss and never order from Green Tea again. I still won't order from them again as they have demonstrated that they couldn't care less about the service they provide. Oh, and my order was wrong!"}
{"text":"Good: 1. Portions - Decent sizing on some of the dishes. 2. Honey garlic spareribs - Probably the best I've ever tasted.  I don't normally like honey garlic but the sauce here is perfect over garlicky and well seasoned chunks of spareribs.  Neutral: 1. Veggies with fried pork belly - Was expecting actual slices of pork belly here but it turned out to be chopped up pieces of crispy pork belly sprinkled over vegetables. It was an interesting addon to a rather mundane dish.  A little on the saltier side.  Bad: 1. Fried rice with BBQ pork - Not great.  Small dish and nary some pork to be found.  The pieces are so microsized the rice might as well be vegetarian.  Hard pass on this one.  Worth it? Probably not.  Dinner for two was close to $50 after tax and tip and that's a little steep for inconsistent Chinese food.  If quality goes up, I would consider coming again."}
{"text":"This place is just ordinary basic Chinese take out The only good thing is their hot n sour soup. Which is great.  However the restaurant struggles with the easy part of running a restaurant, which is friendliness and hospitality.  The management is very cold and borderline rude, personally I like to help small local family run businesses, but they have to be kind I. Return.  I used to go here once or twice a month because I lived next door...now I don't think I'll ever return...despite their tastes hot n sour soup."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick, service was fine, prices were low... That's the only reason I give them two stars. The chicken was chewy and tasted like a freezer even through the breading and sauce. The rice had a TON of onion in it. I like onions more than most people and I still thought it was far too much. Also, the portion of rice was tiny."}
{"text":"I don't understand the low rating, cause I quite liked what I ate.  Green Tea offers Hangzhou cuisine.  Its offerings were most suitable for communal sharing, so we ordered 1 fried rice and some dishes to share.  The most memorable was the braised pork (???).  The colour was a beautiful deep red.  The big piece can be broken with chopsticks.  The fatty part was transluent, and the lean part was not dried like wood (????).  The sauce leaned towards sweet.  I would prefer the meat to be a bit less greasy, but it would be a demanding request.  The fried chicken wings were moist, and the skin was crispy.  The appetizer was not too expensive, so it was a good sharable.  The fried rice had a deep colour but not strong in favour.  If you don't like salty fried rice, this would be great for you.  Personally, I would order something else next time.  There was one more dish that I completely cannot recall what it was, so chance was it wasn't special.  Green Tea offers an alternative regional cuisine in First Markham Place, and may I say in Markham.  Ordering the regional specialities will be my recommendation. The pricing is relatively high, so there is no point in ordering things you can easily get in other restaurants anyway."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here today and really enjoyed it.  Kung Pao Chicken is one of the best in Mesa.  Service (Emily) was friendly and quick.  The inside was nice and clean.  Conveniently located in the Sprouts plaza.  Good value. Portions for the price were great.  Will be coming back regularly.  PS - Found out that new owners bought this restaurant two years ago and are no longer serving Japanese food, only Chinese."}
{"text":"Very rude waitress. Told I if I wanted  home make mustard and sweet and sour sauce I had to ask for it. Got home with mustard and sauce and wife just got off phone with same girl. Told her there was only 1 shrimp in Egg Fu Young. First and last time. Beware."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I went in with no expectations last night. It turned out the food are pretty  decent. The waiting time was about one hour. I was not big fan of the honey fried fish it was super dry. I love the stuff chicken wing, the waiter did mention min 3 orders $8 each (yikes). My favorites are the wings, pork belly chicken soup was super tasty, we had 5 people and we had to pack it to go, also the spicy live fish. We ordered 11 dishes ( way too many). Total is $200 after the membership card.  One thing I really did not enjoy is their tea. It has no taste. We thought we were having hot water until we saw the tea bag in the pot. Also they should not let people cut in the line just because they are friends.  I saw the waitress gave her friends the next table.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This place has always been tasty to me. I always get the Beef Mein Feng or the General Tso's Chicken and have never been disappointed. A lot of people complain about the lack of customer service and all I can say is I do not agree. A few co workers and I order their food at least once a month and they are ALWAYS on time or early! They even call me to let me know they are there waiting. I call my order in for takeout sometimes on the weekend and the front end lady has always been sweet to me! Maybe because I have been giving them my business for so long but I have to say they are sweet, polite, and very generous! I will continue to go there!"}
{"text":"No 50% off today. Waited 30 minutes for a table at around 5pm, and 40 minutes for the first dish, and over an hour for the last dish. We didn't leave, because we already waited that long. Schedule three hours in total if you want to eat there. Service was OK. They were trying hard. Food was different than most Chinese restaurants around. I like their green tea pancake, and stone wok congee. Green tea grilled pork was cold, and not thin enough. Overall, different food, sloooow service."}
{"text":"???????? ????? ?????????25? ????? ??? 25+......... ??????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came here to meet a long lost friend. First time being here, really like the decor and the booth on the sides of this place. We had their signature chicken which came in a hot sizzling plate, a pan fried vege and duck soup. The chicken was my favourite, with the different dips we were able to eat it many ways. All in all, it was a very nice eat out place."}
{"text":"I've visited a couple of times now. I like it! It's Greentea Restaurants first foray outside of China! Lucky us!!  Location: In first Markham place on one of the outside units   Parking: First Markham place parking lot.......  get someone to drive you, you don't need that stress in your life  Decor: This place is so nice. I was told everything came from China. It's pretty, elegant. There are tables, round booth for large groups and regular booths with lots of privacy. Perfect for date night!!   The Goods: So I've tried a few dishes.   My favourites? -pea shoots in golden soup. You get your green and yellow vegetables just like the Canada food guide says! And it's delicious! -the crispy chicken,. That crispy shiny skin. So good -the porks: The bbq and the sweet and sour. The sweet and sour is my fave dish if I had to pick one -green tea pancake. The only items on the menu that have green tea!! It's stuffed with taro -the brick bread. I've never had it before it's so soft and buttery.Mmm carbs  Ok one thing that was odd-they had skewers of meat but they are served chilled. I've never had that before so I'm not sure how I feel about it.  Staff: Everyone is so nice. Service was on point. I'm used to being a little ignored in restaurants in the neighbourhood. Inotice with subsequent visits that everything is starting to fall into place and the rhythm of the restaurant is coming together!  I'll be back. I'll be the one in the corner eating a loaf of bread!!"}
{"text":"The waitress is very rude and doesn't have any customer service manners, I ask for the menu she broth it and slap it on the table, then I ask for jasmine tea and very rude said, if you want tea, first read the menu and see what we sell, didn't answer yes we have or no we don't have jasmine tea. I ordered shrimp and she brought chicken, I told her I didn't ask for chicken and she was arguing with me for awhile telling me Yes, you ordered it!, the place is dirty and she is RUDE. I will never go there again. No wonder why the place is always empty."}
