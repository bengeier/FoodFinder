{"text":"A very classy O'Club with good food and a great bar. Make sure to stop in the Check Six for a few drinks."}
{"text":"Really enjoy their salads, HUGE! And really cheap! 

Return factor? YOU BET!"}
{"text":"I've been to the O Club a few times including the squadron's \"Dining Out\" dinner.  Dinner was average. All very well done and good service.

Nice big spacious venue. I was here recently for a special Mass and refreshments were served afterwards (pastries, donuts, coffee, juice).  A very convenient base venue to use for your next event."}
{"text":"$5 buffet on Wednesday. I had a chicken wrap and it was one of the best ones I've had in a while. Better than the commissary even. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to my former Colonels' retirement ceremony and it was renovated nicely."}
{"text":"Was out at Nellis Air Force Base for a conference and we ate lunch at The Club one day.  I've been on quite a few military bases in my life, but have only eaten at a few O-Clubs. The Club here at Nellis is a very nice facility with great service...and great food to go with it. 

I wasn't tremendously hungry when we came, but I ordered the Reuben and it was really quite good.  Not as good as the Jewish delis back home in Jersey, but good enough.  Looking around it seemed like a big thing to order was a salad...I say 'big thing' because the salads were BIG salads.   

Pretty simple to review this place - Good food, good service, good prices.  Can't go wrong..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my coworkers and boss yesterday. The place was decently busy. I opted to go for the sandwich (deli and wraps) place inside so I cannot speak to the hot food section provided in the main part of the club. The Reuben sandwich I had was good and definitely filled me up. It was a little slow moving through the line but that is what happens when you have 2 people making the food to order as you walk through (similar to a subway). The lady at the beginning was humorous and totally kept cracking jokes and entertaining those of us in line (whether that was her intention or not). All of my companions enjoyed their food as well. The place wasn't spectacular or anything that I would crave and have to come back for but it was a good place to grab a quick bit on base."}
{"text":"We heard the Club had a $5 buffet on Wednesday's. It is only $5 if you are a Club member, otherwise it is $10.95!  Food quality is comparable to a hospital or school cafeteria. I had grilled chicken, dried out and cold. Green beans that were very greasy and seemed to be a mix of canned and frozen these were fairly warm. Carrots that were frozen with a greasy sauce and Luke warm. The salad bar was the best part of the meal. The so called buffet was actually one entree and two sides with a small salad plate. Hubby had a taco salad with carnitas and a coke for $9.95. Taco Bell would have been a better choice. The separate sandwich line would have been a better choice. Never again."}
