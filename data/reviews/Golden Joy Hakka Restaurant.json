{"text":"Excellent food and very clean establishment. A great value as well , would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love this Hakka restaurant. The crispy beef is amazing and the people are very nice. The rest of the food is great too."}
{"text":"This order was from Feb 17th 2016.

First takeout experience was good. The person on the phone was friendly and communicated well. 
The chili chicken: was ok-I got it dry. My hubby really liked it. I may try it wet next time. They don't coat it in flour or batter it's just chicken not fat. Portion is small but decent for 2.
The Beef fried rice: was amazing barely any oil and salt which we would rather not have an abundance of anyway.
The chicken chowmein: was good and generous portion, the ony thing was this had a lot of oil. I had to drain it on paper towels. But, willing to give it another try and ask them to use minimal oil. 
Take out was packed well and on time. 
RATINGS OUT OF 5
FOOD 3.75
COST 3.75

RESTAURANT DON'T KNOW I DIDN'T PICK IT UP.
Compared to other places around here they are a step above. I would have given an additional half star  if I could in terms of food. So all in all 3.5-heading higher."}
{"text":"I can see why this place got an originality award. They have some very original dishes. It's not that spicy.
Service is quick, it's a small place with just a few tables (maybe around 8 tables).
Everything tastes pretty good (we ordered around 8 different dishes), and they don't skim on ingredients. Their fried rice is actually very good. I didn't find their house sauce all that amazing in terms of taste, but it was very fragrant (in a good way). Prices are low. I noticed a lot of people doing pick-up/takeout. 
If you enjoy hakka, you should give this place a visit."}
{"text":"I came in with my mother on a cold rainy day. The waiter wasn't around, so the cook came out and helped us out with deciding what to eat. As a vegan he accommodated to what I felt like eating (spicy garlic broccoli no salt), very odd but he did it! He was very helpful and kind. He even came back out to check up on us even after the waiter was back. 
Needless to say, we come here almost every week now and I still order the same thing, and now he remembers my order!
Not to mention the price on everything is dirt cheap. Great place to eat if your in the mood for good cheap Hakka cuisine."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant as it was a good halfway point between us and some friends, and because of the great reviews on Yelp. Worked out really well! Thanks Yelpers! Between the 5 of us, we ordered a variety of dishes - since we were not too picky, we took the waiter up on his suggestions, and everything was excellent. We were the only diners, but the place was busy with take-out orders. The waiter was very attentive (despite the fact that he was busy) and even offered to take a group photo of us. Thanks again :)"}
{"text":"For such delicious lunch specials under $6, you really can't complain. Great flavour and portions. Service wasn't bad either considering how cheap the food is. Try the chili chicken and chicken pakoras."}
{"text":"Friendly owner. Good food. Fair prices. Probably the best Hakka food joint in the area. Highly recommend people to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Everything I've had here is pretty good. My favourite is the lemon chicken and the soups are pretty good (tom yum & chicken corn)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. I've been looking for something like this in the area and though there are quite a few Chinese places around, I've always been disappointed by the taste and quality of the food. I saw this place on yelp and since it had 4 stars, decided to give it a try. We ordered a noodle dish, lemon chicken and a dinner plate that came with sweet and sour chicken, rice and chicken wings. The noodles needed a little salt but once you added a little soy sauce to them they were wonderful! The lemon chicken was awesome! I tasted it without the sauce and couldn't stop eating it! The lemon sauce was a little disappointing though. It was very runny and didn't have much flavor. Good thing the chicken tasted so good without it! The sweet and sour chicken was great as well. They use white meat which I prefer when ordering chicken that is breaded like that and the sauce was tasty too. The rice was good as well, nothing special but better then in most places I've tried. Again, a little soy sauce made a big difference in taste. Their wings might be good but by the time we got home and unpacked the food, the batter was pretty soggy. I tried to crisp them up again in the oven but it just made them too dry and overcooked. I recommend having the wings in house or if you're going to take them home, ask to have them packed in a separate container and poke some holes in the top to allow the steam to escape. Overall I was pretty happy with the food. The portions are large and price is reasonable. I'll definitely be giving them another try!"}
{"text":"we order a take out from this restaurant and I would say the food was packed very good to keep it warm and tasty.

I was highly recommended to order chilli shrimp and it was indeed a good choice....The food was hot and tasty and they had used large shrimps plus these shrimps were not breaded and can be enjoyed properly. The secret to get large shrimps is to order dinner menu and not lunch as the lunch one has smaller shrimps.  The quantity was quite good and I could not finish it in one go. 

Decent food---lot of choices on the menu! and they have halal meat options stated on the menu."}
{"text":"Found restaurant through YELP. Since it had excellent reviews we gave it a try. 
What a great value. Excellent food. Very large portions. Go for the dishes which have their name associated with them. 
We were a bit confused if it is an Indian or Chinese Restaurant. Our friendly host shared with us that it is a Chinese Restaurant prepared Indian Style. The give away where the fortune cookies. 
We really enjoyed the Indian Style food. 
Well done and thank you YELP for guiding us there,"}
{"text":"Nothing is golden about it! I was really happy that finally found some good place near by. Right now I am feeling like giving less than 1 star. Ruined my evening. Thanks very much!"}
{"text":"I usually come here when I'm upset or down about something. It's my local soul food place. Portions are generous.  Fast service.  I really recommend the Chili Chicken and the Bombay Chicken, dry (without the gravy).  I always order the dinner plates which come with rice as well for under $10. The rice plates are generous too for less but I always order the larger size.  For the price, portions and taste, I give it 5 stars. 

My parents are regulars here too. And Micheal and Peter treat them well also."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Old food. Very stingy. No taste. Small portions. Inside the restaurant stinks. Cooks are miserable due to not enough customers. Avoid. Don't know where they got these photos but its no where close what you are getting"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and fresh. Great value and portions. The Hakka main staples like chii chicken & hot & sour soup is as authentic Hakka Indian as it gets. Love the Hakka fried noodles as well. Can't go wrong with the crispy beef either. Highly recommend this little place."}
{"text":"Good value / prices.. 
Not sure food quality was good enough for return visit. 
Chicken corn soup very good."}
{"text":"Really delicious meal! My family and I were in from out of town and decided to stop by the restaurant after reading the reviews on yelp... And we were definitely not disappointed. This is one of the few times that Indian Chinese food tastes fantastic :) The portion sizes are huge and the prices are very reasonable. I would recommend the chicken sweet corn soup, the Hakka noodles, the chili chicken (with gravy), and the vegetable manchurian. Delicious meal with great service!"}
{"text":"Work nearby and definitely worth visiting to get your hakka fix. The chili chicken is crispy, flavourful and not too oily. The Manchurian rice is super tasty and well-balanced as well. The decor is a little dated, but charming in it's own right, and the service is inarguably welcoming and hospitable. One of my favourite spots in the area."}
{"text":"Decent food, I'm still looking for a amazing Chinese spot near me :( I had their general tao chicken with fried rice and it was okay not the best. If your in the area trust you gut feeling lol"}
{"text":"Convenient location from my place. Not crowded when I went so food was served fast. Price is good. Food is flavored and seasoned not too overwhelming with salt or msg. Crispy chicken is really crispy."}
