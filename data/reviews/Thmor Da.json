{"text":"Thmor Da is the type of place that people swings by after buying their groceries to grab a quick bite, since it is attached to the venerable  Pan-Asian market Kim Phat. The food is usually quite acceptable for this type of restaurant, they also go crazy on the menu by adding a few more elaborate dishes.  Last time I went there with my family, we ordered a Shrimp Tom Yum, a Loc Lac Beef and tomato rice, a shrimp Pad Thai, a beef chow fun smothered with gravy, and a Thai beef Salad.  The Shrimp Tom Yum, while being ok, was underwhelming. The Shrimps were decently sized and there was an acceptable number of shrimps in the soup, but the Mushroom were canned.  THe Loc Lac Beef and Tomato rice were quite tasty, decent wok hei in the rice, a sweet and salty tast to the beef, it was an acceptable plate. Same with the Pad Thai, tasty, albeit they got the order wrong and gave us a small order instead of a large.   The Thai Beef Salad was downright horrible. An overload of bell peppers, probably because they were out of anything else, it was absolutely flavourless. The beef they used was whatever they had left over from the previous service, was a chewy, overcooked, carbonated mess.  We were still hungry and not willing to move, so we ordered the Chow Fun, it was acceptable. They bumped it an extra size to smooth the Beef Salad affair over. Didn't work.  While I do understand they want to distinguish themselves from the other Asian restaurant in the area, if you cannot produce a solid plate of food, take it off your menu or don't serve it that night.  stick to the noodle and rice dishes people."}

{"text":"3.5/5 but because the woman serving us were nice I'll bump it up to a 4.    Thmor Da is a sweet find for me as it can close the loop on a Saturday afternoon food shopping activity with a pit stop in here!  The restaurant is attached to Kim Phat grocery store.  A crazy busy Asian market in MTL.      Menu offerings are your typical Chinese and some excellent options of your basics:  Rice dishes, Soups, Chicken, Noodles, Pork, Beef, Fish, Lobster, Hot Pot, Quails and Duck and Vegetables.  For me this is a pretty complete menu.    Starting off I ordered a HK Style Milk tea and what they brought out was a hot bubble tea with boba.  Not what I was expecting (a bit sweeter) but not bad none the less! 3/5.    For dinner I ordered a #27 Crispy noodles with Beef and Chinese broccoli.  Serving size was good with a nice Cantonese Chow mein brown sauce which wasn't too salty but was nice to soften up the noodles.  Meat portion was adequate and the gai lan (chinese broccoli) was crisp and fresh.    Ordered some food to go as the food was yummy! I ordered a Cantonese Chow Mein #28 and a #93 Thai Beef.  The woman serving me asked if I'd like the noodles separate.  They know how to serve takeout!  I had a taste of the Thai beef and it was nice and spicy!  My wife ate a bit when I got home and she said her lips were on fire.  I told her I was proud of her!  Good job Cheri I said!  Spicy food is good for the soul!    Will definitely try more as I come back.  Pricing and serving size is generous and Asian inexpensive!   For me I can become a regular at a place like this as price and quality seems good!  They have a lunch menu, serve General Tao chicken (for the Quebecois) and it appears they charge $1 extra for takeout.  Don't be scared however as price is very reasonable!"}
