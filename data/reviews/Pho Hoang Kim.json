{"text":"Situated in the Golden Gate Plaza, the restaurant is right where the former Xe Lua Vietnamese Cuisine  with its iconic pho train store sign used to be. Having been to predecessor restaurant a couple times in the past, I can tell you that nothing has really changed.   The renovations and furnishing are exactly the same, and the menu is almost identical. But then again, most Vietnamese restaurants serve up similar dishes anyway.   Despite the large size of the restaurant, it was practically empty when it came to customers. Perhaps it gets busier during lunch or after-hours, but it was actually kind of scary to be the only two people in the entire restaurant eating when we went.  \"Grilled Pork and Spring Roll Vermicelli\" ($7.25) : The vermicelli that they serve here isn't the traditional thin ones, but instead the more common thick ones most Chinese-owned Vietnamese restaurants use. I didn't mind it too much since I actually like this type of noodle. The bowl was  really hot when it was brought out to us. I wonder if this means it was pre-made and microwaved? The meat was tasty, but nothing else to commend about here.  Small Sized Special Pho ($6): For a small sized pho, this was actually really big. Often times you will get a large bowl that makes it look like there is a lot food, but is really just filled with soup. Here, the bowl is a reasonable size for a small, but is packed with noodles and meat. Really good deal for $6. In terms of the quality, I have a more reserved opinion. The soup was saltier and oilier than most places, and you can actually see the layer of oil floating atop the soup. The quality of the meat wasn't that much better -- it was relatively tough and chewy. I had this one huge blob of tripe in my bowl, and it was a real mission to eat uncut. In general, not too impressed.  Overall nothing too memorable about this place. For about the same price I'd definitely rather go down the street to Time Square and eat and Kim Po. Better food, nicer environment, and most importantly, there are other people there!"}
{"text":"This Viet joint has replace the Xe Lua that moved out to Bayview and Major Mackenzie.  The quality of food from then to now has dropped slightly, however the quantity and pricing still mean that it is an affordable late lunch/early dinner.  They provide the option of thick or thin noodles for the Pho, but they seemed to provide a random mix for the Bun dish.  Definitely do not come here expecting gourmet viet food, but if you are looking for a quiet meal this is the place to go. Judging from past reviews it sounds as if they have improved slightly, which is always a good sign. They moved to proper tea cups and they have improved their plating time.   Still no lunch specials though =("}
{"text":"So for my first pho restaurant on my quest for pho in toronto, I decided to come to a new place that I haven't been to before.  Pho Hoang Kim was the place and it had recently taken the place of an old Xe Lua (train pho).  On the outside, well... and inside it's pretty much the same thing.  Forget renovating when taking over another restaurant... why not just use everything the other place did?  That's exactly what Pho Hoang Kim did.  I ordered the Pho Pilgrimage special (special pho + fresh shrimp rolls) and waited as I got the food.  The wait was ridiculous!  I mean I didn't really mind that much at first, but then it got to the point when I was kinda getting impatient.  It was a saturday afternoon and they had 2 people working... total.    When the food finally came, the first thing I did was taste the broth.  It wasn't really well balanced.  Kinda tasted like they used a bunch of salt or MSG to even it out (ie. didn't take the time to get it right).  The next thing I had was the rare beef.  I have a feeling they cooked it already and then put it in the broth.  Other than that, the brisket wasn't stupendous.  One thing that did impress me was the beef balls they had in it.  I really like beef tendon balls, so it was right up my alley.  I think they were the best things in the bowl.  Second thing about the bowl of pho that was disappointing.  The noodles were actually chinese rice noodles.  I mean, this is kind of a big deal.  To give them a bit of credit, I've actually bought them before.  They say \"Vietnamese Rice Noodles\" on the package, but trust me... they are chinese rice noodles.  What's the difference?  They're basically the same noodles as the ones you get at the mandarin... you know, the thick ones that are usually soy sauce coloured?  The only difference is that they are cut to about 7mm wide.      Now on to the fresh rolls.  I think I could have had better fresh rolls from McDonalds.  Why you might ask?  In the fresh rolls were 3 ingredients (not including the actual wrapping); there was shrimp, rice noodles and lettuce.  That is all.  WTF?  It's like they copied a McSnack wrap and decided it was a good idea.  Now I'm really not that big of a stickler for restaurant that isn't 100% clean, but I think this place crosses the line.  Here's a nice little list of what I found:  oily floors, napkins that lived on the floor, eyebrow hair in the soup, steel wool in the soup.  BRUTAL!  Heath and safety board please come here and have a field day.  I'd hate to say this, but I really can't wait till this place closes down and a new place comes in.  Seriously, how did this place even make it this far?  Maybe it's cause they didn't really renovate?  =P"}
{"text":"Late Night at 2 am or is it early morning?... Pho Hoang Kim is the Only Pho place in the RH area still opens!   We ordered Pho and Bun Bo Hue with no expectation and both were good.  I don't mind coming back again for a hot bowl of noodle after last call on weekend since they opens till 5 am!!?   Seriously, one of the best drunk food at an affordable price!  Extra Stars for staying open so late....."}
