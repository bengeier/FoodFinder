{"text":"Great staff who recognize their frequent customers, burrito is straight up satisfying. My favourite burrito place although burrito boyz is a close second"}
{"text":"Amazing! Burrito is huge and very filling! Was pleasantly surprised they have vegan option too! They have may topping choices as well as whole wheat and white flour tortilla of course! Prices are cheap too, don't miss out! Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"ordered a steak burrito, came cold on the inside. lettuce isn't a good burrito topping, it's just cheap."}
{"text":"Nasty, nasty, nasty!  Don't do it! The food was gross! The fish taco was microwaved and smelled awful. I almost puked in the restaurant. Everything is dirty, floors counters, tables. The chips are worse then dollar store brand and tasted like play-do. Worst experience eating out ever."}
{"text":"Would rate this restaurant 0 stars if I could... Service was very mediocre. Almost seemed like the guys working there didn't want to be there... Food was also very bland. I'm normally not picky when it comes to food, but it just seemed like everything we ordered didn't have enough spices or wasn't really fresh. Will not return..."}
{"text":"Food is terrible, had the burrito bowl and I should have know the  quality of the food was going to be questionable because the window where they prep the food is all covered up so you can't see anything. 
Beans were overcome, salad was old, chorizo was really any sausage and chicken was bland. Overall not great food , would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I had an urge for a taco salad in a crispy taco shell, so I stopped in at Bar Burrito and ordered their taco salad with chicken, with a side of nachos and salsa, to go. I grabbed a couple small containers of their fresh salsa from the self-serve station before I left. When I got home and tried the nachos with fresh salsa I found (or smelled and tasted) that the salsa was off. It smelled like it was pulled out of the garbage. It was anything but fresh. So I had to toss it. I moved on to the salad and found that the taco shell bowl was stale. Not only stale but really bland. I couldn't even tell what it was made out of. So I basically ate the actual salad out of the bowl and tossed the rest out. I was so unsatisfied and I don't think I can bring myself to try them again."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos. The veggies didn't seem fresh. The fish was delicious and perfectly cooked but very scarce in the taco. Portion did NOT match the price. Save your $$ and go to chipotle"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place I wanted to order a naked burrito bowl according to their website when u order online it means no taco shell bowl. They tried to serve it to me with the bowl I told them I didn't want it. So what they did was just dump the salad into a takeout tray without the effort of remaking it. When I got it I did not think they put anything but salad in there. The taste didn't impress me either. For a 1st time customer I could not believe the lazy customer service they had. I will not come again. And that is saying a lot.  I usually give a place 3 chances.  One to think of it they didn't even provide cutlary for take out. .. disgusting service if I could vote zero I would"}
{"text":"Not sure if the management changed or not but it's not like what it used to be. The ingredients are not fresh as before (tastes like canned salsa), the 'extras at no charge' are rarely ever included when requested - why even have a sign for the extras when it doesn't even get included most of the time, and just the overall burrito itself has not been the same. 

I ordered a naked burrito on-the-go, so unfortunately, I wasn't able to address the issues there. 

So disappointed :("}
{"text":"I used to come here for their taco salad, which was a pretty decent, fresh salad served on top of a fresh and tasty tortilla. Now, however, they serve their taco salad on a gross and stale tortilla that inedible. Very disappointing. 

I've also tried their fish taco, which was OK, but nothing special. The fish didn't taste all that fresh and was soggy. 

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Bland Burrito is more like it. I mean they're not the worst things you'll ever have and are certainly more than edible. But that's about it. Having tried both the veggie soy and the bean and cheese (I'm a vegetarian) I can safely say these are among the blandest, most dry burritos I've ever tasted. I had to add half a jar of salsa / burrito sauce just to make the things palatable. The ingredients are fresh and the burritos are technically well made. The flavor just isn't there.

And no, it's not just the veggie options. Family members have had the chicken, steak and fish burritos and had the exact same complaints. Burrito Boyz, Mucho Burrito, Taco del Mar, Fat Bastard Burrito and pretty much all the others are more interesting choices. If I didn't have those as a frame of reference perhaps I'd think Bar Burrito was just fine but as it is, they just don't quite make the grade."}
{"text":"Ok , so I gave a new burrito place a try this evening ! 
Sadly , not what I was expecting.
What was I expecting ? 
I suppose a bit more like some of there competition .
I won't mention any names but you all know who that is ! 
Anyways I got a naked steak burrito ,
It was fairly small as it was in a taco bowl .
Not much portion at all ...in fact I was still hungry when I finished it . 
Quality wise it was the same ..just mediocre to be honest and that makes me sad ......
The prices are about the same as there  competitors just not the same in quality by any means . 
Quality  -- 6 out of 10
Quantity -- 6 out of 10 
Service --  7 out of 10"}
{"text":"I came for lunch on Sunday.  The fish tacos did not use fish filets (it used to) but they used fish paste cake instead.  Absolutely unacceptable.  My boyfriend had a pork burrito, and he said it was okay.  

Business seemed slow for lunch, so they might have lowered the quality of the fish.  Sad, but it is called Bar Burrito not Bar Taco, so I am not lowering its rating until I can try more things.  I just recommend against the fish taco or fish burrito (assuming they use fish paste cake as well)."}
{"text":"A nice cozy place. 
The guys over the counter and kitchen are nice and friendly. 
The order is cooked fresh in front of your eyes. 
The food is good, and the price is reasonable, in sync with most of the other Mexican food joints. If you want a good quick bite with fresh ingredients, but nothing fancy... it's a good place to head for."}
{"text":"I came here about 1:00 on a weekday and I was worried that it would be extremely busy because of the high schools in the area but it turns out the students must have been just at the end of their lunch breaks because they weren't inside Bar Burrito when I went. I came here to grab a before work snack to hold me over till my lunch break. 

I ordered a Large Chicken Burrito with no lettuce and no tomatoes I asked for it spicy and the man behind the counter kept telling me how spicy the hot sauce was I love spicy food so I was insistent on them making it spicy. It was significantly smaller then other burrito joints I've been to but it was tastey. The chicken was well seasoned and toasted and the salsa was awesome but onto the hot sauce I ate what was supposed to be insanely hot without any water. Im not sure if my taste buds have just died from years of eating overly spicy food and maybe it was actually spicy to the normal person. So don't trust my opinion on spiciness but none the less it was a tastey burrito and although it was smaller its probably the amount I should eat but since i love to eat I could have gone for more but I was satisfied after.

I will probably be back here again before work and I recommend it to others who love burritos. Ive noticed not all Bar Burritos are the same though so this location in particular is good but I can't say that for all of the Bar Burrito locations."}
{"text":"Expensive as hell for shit food. And they ain't even Mexican. Their all straight from china town. A lingling there and a lingling there."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the fish tacos. I often get the three hard shell: fish, steak, and chicken. They are very small, but very delicious. The price doesn't reflect the portion, but the taste makes up for it. They used to give free nachos with the order, now you pay for them separately...tsk tsk burrito man, bad business choice there! Happy eating"}
{"text":"In the daytime the owners work so don't go there because they're mean with the portions it totally sucks ... if I go in there and see the wife or the husband I'll be turning around... fuck that bitch"}
{"text":"Good food, tasty and priced well.  I'm not 100% sure what prevents me from rating it 4* (and I pretty much NEVER rate 5*), but yah...perhaps I need to mix up what I'm ordering? !? We'll see next time."}
