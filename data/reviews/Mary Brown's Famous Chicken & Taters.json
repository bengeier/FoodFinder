{"text":"This must be the worst Mary Brown's in Canada. DO NOT GO!  I asked for 2 mini Mary's. When I opened the boxes I soon realized that the chef just cut two pieces of chicken in two and put them on the buns. When I called the store to see what the issue was, the Owner informed me that this is how they make them. When I said that I would confirm with the Corporate Head office, he told me \"sure, they will give you coupons you fuc&\"  Very disappointing. This Mary Brown's is not keeping it honest."}
{"text":"Next time you decide to get Mary Browns, don't. I would recommend even going to McDonald's over this place. Instant regret when you enter. Not only are the customers depressed but so are the employees. The \"taters\"  were dry, crunchy, over salted and over cooked to the point where ketchup made no difference. The chicken was \"ok\". You will rethink your life after eating here."}
{"text":"Horrid experience. We even sent in a comment card it was so bad, and we never do that kinda thing. Will never go back, the worst service around."}
{"text":"Worst service ever will not go back.  I walked in the store 45 minutes until close. The store didn't have the pieces of chicken I wanted. Chef in the back said it would take an extra 20 minutes to make, and I said I'd wait.   Seemed aggravated from me simply requesting the types of chicken I wanted. Made a small change to the order and chef throws his hands up in the air and says I could just take the 4 pieces of chicken that was already sitting there and that I didn't want. Never mind the cashiers' attitude.  All in all the service was beyond poor...ended up walking out."}
{"text":"There needs to be more Mary Brown's in the city. The chicken was well seasoned with a crispy batter but less greasy than popeyes and KFC. That's a big plus!!   The fries were thick and tasty as well. The chicken isn't cheap as 13 pieces cost $21.99 before tax and medium fries are almost $5. Worth it for the quality.   The website can improve by listing the prices.  I'm not sure if they deliver."}
{"text":"First visit; M.B.s was new to us, being from the States. Gave a try as it was close to our hotel. Two meals, about $20.  2-pc. chix meal looked good but both chicken & taters were virtually flavorless. The pulled chix sandwich however was quite tasty. Sides: slaw was fine; macaroni had a hint of spice but otherwise as bland as taters. Settled for Pepsi drinks but no ice available! Servers were very pleasant & helpful, but overall the visit for us was not worth it."}
{"text":"Easy eating: not salty or spicy, or greasy. Has exactly the right moisture content. Also has drive-through, and they're on Skip The Dishes. Way better than KFC ever was or could hope to be, or Chicken on the Way. The only drawback for me is it's a Pepsi place. I prefer Coke, or variety/alternatives. Staff were great, and the service was fast. I stopped on my home for take-out and hardly noticed the wait."}
{"text":"Fast curteous staff. The Big Mary is delicious. Parking is a bit of a mess but worth the trouble"}
{"text":"Since I am not generally a fan of fried foods I never thought that I would ever go here, but we were starved and it was the best of the options still open.   We ordered a share plate for $15.99 which included 3 tenders, 3 pieces of chicken, some taters, gravy, dipping sauce and two sodas.   The first surprise was that taters are not tater tots but wedge fries. They and the gravy were okay but we only finished half of the medium size that was given. I could take them or leave them going forward.   The second surprise was that I loved their chicken tenders. They were battered real slabs of unprocessed white meat chicken and maybe it was my ravenous state but I thought they were moist and tasty. If I return, they would definitely be what I would order. They also give you they option of about 6 dipping sauces. We tried the sweet & sour and the chipotle and both were decent.   I was a little less impressed with the whole pieces of chicken. I found the batter a little thick and ended up peeling most of it off. The chicken itself was moist and tender.   Bonus points for having cans of diet Dr. Pepper!  My expectations were pretty low and I was pleasantly surprised. I am not sure how likely I will return, but if you like fried chicken you could do a lot worse. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The portion sizes here are about the same as KFC and the prices are as well.  I can't complain about anything. Its fried chicken fast food. You get what you come for.   You can't beat a chicken sandwich for under $3 on Mondays. Fast and friendly service to boot."}
{"text":"We ordered food to go and when we got home and opened our containers we realized the entire order was incorrect. None of the sides were right, the wing flavor was wrong, and our daughters order was completely missing. Chicken was tasty but we will never order to go from here again."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at Mary Brown's before and spontaneously stopped in this afternoon.  I had to yell for service after a minute or so as the staff were in the back and didn't hear me come in.  The ladies apologized but the one who handled my transaction had an awkwardly cold attitude for the first few minutes.  The front of her shirt was absolutely filthy.  I don't know if they have aprons and if not, they should invest in some.  At least it could be removed for front-line work and would save someone from looking like they were butchering chicken and repulsing the customers.  She finally made an attempt at small talk as I waited for my order.  However, she lead the discussion to a negative subject and just made me want to leave.  I tried the Pulled Chicken Sandwich.  Not sure what to think of it.  Some of the chicken pieces were dry and I don't know if I'm a fan of the coleslaw on it.  The buns are not super high quality so the sandwich got soggy rather quickly.  The taters are good, I'll give them that.  The seasoning used on them is such that you don't really need ketchup or anything else to dip them with as they have their own flavor.  A small order was plenty enough for me.   If I ever return, I'd likely go to another location and try the Big Mary, which is what the cashier recommended."}
{"text":"It was take out night and the old man was craving some fried chicken.  The chicken was ok, but I thought it could have been spiced a little bit more.  The fries were meh and found some of the bigger wedges to be quite undercooked.   This isn't a place that I would seek out to get again and it is probably a meal that I would pass up for something else."}
