{"text":"Very good food! I expected everything to be soaked in curry, but it's not. Everything was very fresh and flavorful, and the only spice was the green sauce I had them put on my chicken tikka.  The potato mixture is delicious, too. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Sigh, I had high expectations with this going in right in the heart of Strongsville. 

Pros:
-No lines
-Location

Cons:
-Food was cold
-Extemely expensive, $23 for 2 small bowls and small drinks.
-Atmosphere is a miss, trying to be chipotle modern but just comes across as bare, empty with an echo.
-I like indian food, but this tastes more like frozen leftovers from the indian cafeteria style in the mall.

Lets just say you don't have to look far if you want more value and fresher food, Chipotle is across the street."}
{"text":"The suburbs can have heavenly food?! I expect to see a second one of these downtown Cleveland in the next year-- the execution is phenomenal. The owners are a ball to spend time with; they're friendly and rightfully passionate about the food they're making. I try to make the pilgrimage out here as much as humanly possible. 

Get the brown rice bowl with garbanzo beans, okra, and lamb meatballs(the lamb will make you happy cry). Also get your paws on as much of the chutneys as possible and use it to spice your meals for the rest of the week. 

A master designed the flavors here. It goes above and beyond anything you'd ever expect in the price range and is truly a scalable idea. IMHO, the next chipotle. It's time we embraced more diverse street food."}
{"text":"My husband picked up take-out here on Friday night. We both had a roti roll and I also tried a veggie samosa. My roll was vegetarian, paneer (cheese) with spinach and veggies added on, along with mint chutney and rice. The flavors were really good, and I was happy with the spice level, as I like really spicy food and was worried it might be a little bland since the fillings are not made to order. My biggest complaint is the roll/filling was not very warm, and we live less than 5 minutes away. The rolls were both very stuffed, mine to the point of splitting, so it was challenging to eat as well. The samosa was very small (less than half the size in comparison to the size of samosas I've had at other Indian restaurants), the potato inside was pretty bland, and it did not come with any chutney, which was disappointing. We will go back, but eat inside this time to see if that helps with temperature issue. My dream would be if they added dosas to the menu, but I think that's a long-shot."}
{"text":"I just moved to Strongsville OH from AZ literally 2 days ago and Bhelwala was literally my first adventurous meal out here. No regrets! Great experience! 

Like what the fellow yelpers said below, this is an indian fast food restaurant in chipotle/subway style. You choose your carb style or whatever it's called (rice bowl, salad, or roti wrap) first, then you move down the lane to get your choice of protein (veggies/chicken/lamb), complimentary toppings (potatoes OR garbanzo beans), sauce  (spinach/tikka masala), MORE veggies (more like toppings), and MORE sauces (chutney, hot sauce with garlic, and yogurt raita). Extra 99 cents for okra, just FYI. 

The service was GREAT! They really cater to your needs and are extremely nice. They will let you sample the sauces, too!

My rice bowl was surprisingly good and I will definitely be back again! It was really flavorful and I highly recommend getting both the hot sauce and the yogurt."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner last night and really enjoyed the entire experience. The staff was very friendly and did a great job explaining all of the food. We have eaten our fair share of Indian food, but it was nice hearing everything explained so well for those who are less familiar. The dinning room was laid out nicely and well decorated.

The food was delicious! We both had a Roti Roll. I had chicken and my wife had the lamb meatballs. Both were tender and flavorful. All of the other ingredients were fresh and added great flavor. I think the amount of options is just about perfect. Plenty to choose from without being overwhelming.

This will be on my short list of lunch break eats. 

If you haven't tried Indian food, I think this is the perfect place to start."}
{"text":"Welp this is one of my new favorite places. Love everything about this place. The food is incredible, seems really clean. Staff has always been helpful every time I go in. The ordering is confusing but the staff is great to help you along. 

Only tip would be that the food needs salt. Took some home and added salt and it was the best meals I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"Delicious and truly unique! Bhelwala has a Chipotle vibe; customize your meal - the way you like it. I had a chicken tikka masala rice bowl with the coriander and mint chutney. I would have liked a little more spice, so I will try the red chili and garlic next time. I really liked the freshness of the veggies. I'm already planning to return with my beau. I think Bhelwala will really open the door for people who might not usually venture to try Indian food. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall with fabulous home cooking.  Had the beef and veggies with rice. Delicious! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Indian food. The owner walked us through what each component of the dish was, and was very knowledgeable and friendly. Also gave us very generous portions! I've tried Indian food prior to coming here, but if you've never tried it before, this would be a great start! I only wish there was one in Louisville!"}
{"text":"Great food and very personable service. It's a chipotle-sequel take on Indian food. My wife and I both had excellent meals. There was a good amount of people for later on a Friday night and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Glad to have another good food option in Strongsville."}
{"text":"As an Indian, did not liked the food. It would be more suitable to American folks. Here nothing tastes like the great Indian street food.
Would prefer Chipotle more.  
Highly disappointed with the taste, not advisable to people looking for the Indian taste.
Ambiance and Hygiene is good."}
{"text":"Great offering for a nice healthy meal.  Friendly, helpful staff.  It's like an Indian version of chipotle."}
{"text":"I tried bhelwala on a whim tonight, I'm so glad I did! this is absolutely amazing. I got the chicken Tika I believe it was, I love it. the man who helped me was amazing and I'm thankful that I had him to help me! go try this."}
{"text":"Love love love the pani puri! The staff was really friendly and walked you through the options. Wish they made fresh naan, but their garlic naan isn't half bad. Their chicken Tikka is delicious and the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"I love coming here. As others said, it's similar in concept to Chipotle (bowl, wrap, etc) but Americanized Indian food. I'm not as concerned as others about \"authenticity\", it's good, you can get things as hot or mild as you want, the chutneys are good and the naan is excellent with a side cup of whatever chutney you like (I'm a huge fan of the cucumber one) The coriander mint is good with a little bit in the food (it has a potent kick) and the red chili garlic is way too hot for me (I'm more a medium heat flavour preference) but if you mix the red chili with the cucumber, it tempers a bit and really good on the naan. I also like that the food reheats well (something chipotle for example does not one bit reheat well) because the portions are pretty robust."}
{"text":"Great indian fast casual spot in a convenient location on pearl road in strongsville.  easy to find.  Great staff that helped me figure out my order as a first timer.  Very approachable dining experience with indian food.  Fresh, tasty ingredients.  Lots of seating inside and well decorated.  Perfect portion sizes.  I will pass on the word to my friends to visit this place!!"}
{"text":"Convenient way to enjoy a quick Indian meal. Food was fresh & tasty. Staff very helpful w assembly of bowls, wraps etc. By all means, go!

Sadly... Closed"}
{"text":"My first time here and I thought it was great! Everyone that was working was super friendly! I went in after looking at the menu online and already decided what I was getting, but the girl at the counter insisted I try everything! So glad she did I tried things I might not have ever tried and it was all flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"So happy to have an Indian food offering in my town finally! They can be costly but its worth it. The food is amazing and very tasty. The people behind the recipe's know how to cook. And thats the kicker here. I love it."}
{"text":"Chipotle but with Indian food! You pick roti, rice, or salad then your meat, veggies, & sauces. 

Highly recommend! The staff was super sweet and helpful too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fast-casual Indian food that unfortunately totally missed the mark the night we tried it...overall a disappointing experience, and I had such high hopes after a few glowing reviews from friends who had been there.

The naan we ordered was taken out of a tray and reheated on a flattop giving it a somewhat soggy/chewy consistency instead of that charred/crisp outside you'd normally expect.

The samosa we tried was baked (not fried) so it was kind of mushy, but the potato and spice filling was tasty.

Our Paneer Tikka roll with Palak (Spinach) Masala was tasty and is something I might try again.  The chicken Tikka Masala was okay, sauce was not as flavorful as I expected (too much rice in the bowl relative to the meat and sauce combination).  The lamb meatballs with Palak Masala and yogurt riata was the best dish of those we sampled, although it had a distinct Greek (not Indian) flair to it.

I'm pretty sure I'll give this spot another try as I really want this place to succeed, given the lack of interesting (and diverse) eating spots around town."}
{"text":"The staff was really nice and the food tasty.  I'll probably go back, but I like a  near by Indian restaurant better and go there.  This place and Indian version of Chipotle."}
{"text":"We had a very good meal with exceptional service.  I wish they were a little more adventurous with their spices, but I understand that they are trying to appeal to a wider American audience.  The staff was very patient with us and even replaced my son's apple juice when he spilled it, no charge.  We will definitely go back and work it in to our regular restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Tried Bhelwala for the first time last night. First, the staff was very helpful and even offered tastes. As others have pointed out they seem to be modeled after Chipotle which is a good idea. I do like Indian food and was excited to try this. I was a little disappointed in the taste as it lacked the Indian spice I am used to with other Indian restaurants. I think I is good for Americans who want to try something different but not too spicy. I will probably come back and give it another try but will not rush in."}
{"text":"Danielle and i got a light dinner here tonight and it was really good. Danielle had a Chicken Tikka Masala rice bowl w/ sauteed veggies and fresh veggies. i had a Chicken Tikka Masala Roti w/ rice. I wanted no other toppings but the woman preparing our food insisted on sending veggies and various chutneys home w/ us to try. I tried them all (she left out the cilantro and cucumber ones because i'm not a fan) and I tried them all and they were really good. i also had a samosa which was pretty good as well. they were nice enough to offer us coupons for our next visit and also let us know that they will soon have sugar free chai :)"}
{"text":"What a lovely place. I had plenty of samples and liked it all. but I ended up going with a rice bowl with the meatballs and they are amazing. be sure to check this place out and bring friends. I enjoyed this experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Always had a great experience. The employees are always kind & helpful. The samosas are awesome. Every time their food hits the spot."}
{"text":"So I've been meaning to check out this place for a while and since I was in the area today, I decided to check it out.  It is located in a strip mall off Pearl Rd in Strongsville.  Walking in the decor is modern and clean- it does remind me of Chipotle and has a cool quote from Gandhi on the wall.  The server was very friendly and generous in her offerings of samples.  She was patient in explaining how the system works which I appreciated.  

Ultimately, I got two entrees to go- rice bowls with Lamb meatballs,  paneer and chicken.  I tried each of the sauces as well as accompaniments and got a samosa to go.  Overall, it was decent.  It seemed like flavors might have been toned down a bit for American tastes.  Would've appreciate some stronger spices since that is what Indian food is known for.  Lamb meatballs were delicious and numerous. Chicken was a little bit overcooked.  I wish they were more generous with their rice. My wife and I finished the meal not quite full despite having the tasty and well made samosa. 

Overall, I'd come again but not make a special trip out to Strongsville to go here.  If I was a local I'd probably be back more often.  Ultimately I think that I liked Flavors of India a little more,  especially their buffet even though it costs a little more.  Hope this place succeeds- we need more of these kinds of restaurants in CLE."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food was great both times. The first time, they took the time to walk me through how to order and all the different ingredients. The second time I went, I had my son with me who is 2 months old. I stopped to get lunch to go after doing errands. They saw offered to help me carry my order to my car since I had my hands full. Not many places offer to do things like that. 

Stop in and try it. It's quick and everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and I was so excited for this place to open up.  I also love small businesses and I would rather spend my money at a small, family-owned place such as Bhelwala, than a large corporate diner, like Chipotle's.

So why did I only give 3 stars?  

PROS:  
1) Food was tasty
2) Service was friendly
3) Restaurant was clean + pleasant
4) Free wi-fi

CONS:
1) Portions were small
2) Food was pricey
3) Naan wasn't very good
4) Rice was mushy
5) Food was barely warmer than room temp

I have to say that I came on a day that Bhelwala was having trouble with their rice cooker(s)  I don't know if they have 2 separate rice cookers, however, there was no brown rice available and the white rice wasn't ready until 20 minutes after opening.  The white rice was bland and pretty mushy, almost like porridge.

Since the rice wasn't ready when the restaurant opened, the four customers, including myself, waited patiently.  None of us wanted to be pushy, so none of us waited AT the counter.  Instead, we all sat at tables, waiting for a signal when the rice would be ready.  The owner/manager Chris was very apologetic and kept thanking us for our patience.

It was upsetting when a fifth customer walked in, went straight for the counter (because he didn't know that the rest of us had been waiting) and the Bhelwala girl just took his order, letting him order ahead of all of us.  She should have said, \"Sir, these people have been patiently waiting, so if you don't mind, I'll tend to them first\"

Anyway, we finally got to order.  The Bhelwala girl was very friendly and helpful in describing the various meats, veggies, sauces and whatever else you could pick to add to your order.  It was nice that she took the time to explain all the items.

I ordered the chicken and my husband ordered the lamb meatballs.  While the meat was tasty, it wasn't very hot.  I'm referring to the food temperature.  Everything felt only a little warmer than room temperature, and this was just as the restaurant opened.  (We dined in) We also ordered naan (bread) which was bland and did not have a great texture.  I've bought better naan at Costco, ready-made.  The portions of the food were pretty small.  The bowls were just over half full.  We still felt hungry after our meal, and we are not big eaters at all.  

We ordered the 2 entrees, one piece of naan and no drinks and our order came to $23, which seemed like a LOT for such little food.  We could have gotten more food at Chipotle across the street, with drinks for less than that.  We also could have gone to our favorite Indian place, Jaipur Junction, and gotten all-you-can-eat Indian food for under $20 total.

I understand that the issues with the rice cooker(s) might have made a significant impact on the food we received.  However, the food being lukewarm, the portions being small and the overall price of the meals weren't impacted by the rice cooker problem.

Again, I love small businesses and I feel a little sad posting this review.  The owner/manager seemed like a very nice man and I hope this business is successful for him.  He did offer us a coupon for a free meal (to compensate for our wait) so perhaps we will give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and this concept. First, remember that this isn't any more \"authentic\" Indian than Chipotle is authentic Mexican or Piada is authentic Italian. It is similiar in taste profile, but I wouldn't compare this to my favorite full service Indian restaurant. However, it is super fast and lets me get a quick taste of Indian when I don't have much time. 

The spice levels vary with what you order. One dish was very mild. Another was \"I need more water\" spicy. I liked both, but I always prefer spice to no spice. They let you taste the items and sauces and you can even ask to have a bunch of sauces on the side so you  an decide which flavors you like. And the staff has been friendly and willing to offer suggestions. 

It has a \"chain\" feel to it but it's a single, locally owned location. I'm sure they hope to open more. I hope they do well. I love having something different in the 'burbs."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've never really tried Indian food before coming here so I can't compare to other indian places, but from the moment I walked in It was a great experience. Its a fast casual restaurant with a set up like Chipotle for ordering. I walked up and the employee was super friendly and explained the menu and how to order to me since it was my first time. I had the rice bowl with potatoes, chicken, Tikka Masala, yogurt sauce, and some vegetables. Then I had the hot garlic sauce on the side(gamechanger, but super hot so it would be too much if I got it in the bowl). Food tasted great and was pretty healthy."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place and was not disappointed! Fast, informative when I had questions, and - most important - delicious! Added an order of the Naan to my bowl and practicality inhaled it. Good deal for the money too! Big bowl and 2 orders of Naan for about $10 - can't get much better than that! Definitely going back and recommending to my friends."}
{"text":"indian chipotle, was oh so good! my bowl at chipotle is always literally pushed to the extremes of being filled up, the pictures i saw for this restaurant they seemed as if they were small portions but I still went and went i got there i actually did get a lot of food, you just have to ask for what you want or ask for more (no extra charges on the regular items)"}
{"text":"This place is to Indian food what Chipotle is to Mexican street food, and what Piada is to Italian street food. You order at the counter, where you will see a menu of three basic choices to start with; roti, salad or rice bowl, and then you choose your fillings and toppings. I went with a brown rice bowl topped with pav bahji masala, a spicy mix of veggies in Indian spices. I added the potato mixture (you can also get chole, or channa as it's also known), and then you have options of cooked and fresh veggies and sauces. I tried both the tamarind sauce and the mint chutney and both were excellent. The food was fresh and tasty, and the service was helpful and friendly. A nice place to stop for a quick and healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I am Indian and also born and raised in Strongsville so when I heard an Indian restaurant was opening in Strongsville my interest was piqued. Finally got around to checking the place out today and was not disappointed. The place is worth checking out because they took traditional Indian menu items and served them in an non-traditional way. I got the chicken tikka and had it in a roti which was wrapped like a burrito. Even put some okra and other veggies in there. The red chili spice was not \"Indian spicy\" but it was good. Had a samosa on the side. There are many different options so you can mix and match, so I'll be back. I appreciate the attempt at fusing Indian food into a fast casual restaurant. I wish they had some South Indian options, so hopefully they develop some in the future. The owners were there and seemed like good people. And finally, I got some chai at the end and I think even my mom would approve. There isn't a similar restaurant on the west side of Cleveland so it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Concept is good based on chipotle , but the food  has no flavor . Spice level is zero or can say suited to American taste buds .chipotle or Italian food has more flavors .
In the name of street food they just hav 2 options CINNAMON bhelpuri (I guess Americanized ) and  samosa chat  only 
Again the chutneys r watery  , salt less  and flavorless 
 Paneer tikka  was more like paneer cooked in tomato and yogurt 
A small  bhelpuri cup for $3.50  pricey food huh ! 
Coming to Indian place and getting pita bread as naan and wheat tortilla as roti  was big turnoff 
 The portions r small , so If ordering rice bowl  for 1 person than be prepared to order something else or u can remain hungry .

In an all I was here to have some street food And all I got was cinnamon flavored bhelpuri  and  choley chawal .

Next time I'll prefer going to chipotle rather going to bland indian food .
For me it's a big NO NO"}
{"text":"This was SO GOOD. I love Indian food but have to confess I do not know about all the different options out there and what they all taste like.
THe girl behind the counter gave me a taste of EVERYTHING before I created my bowl.
Very clean, good food, will go again.
Reminded me of CHipotle style ordering, but with Indian flavor
Indian spices are healthy, so I will go again"}
{"text":"I was very excited for this place to open. I went the first day and was greeted and served with much friendliness and a knowledgeable staff. I am a big fan of Indian food, and this was tasty! I even decided to go here for my birthday dinner :)"}
{"text":"Our first experience at Bhewala was fantastic.  The man who led us through our menu options was very helpful.  We ended up with a brown rice bowl with lamb meatballs & Okra.  It was a substantial portion of which the left overs are going to make the perfect lunch tomorrow.  
I've left out the most important part of my review - the food was delicious!!! The meatballs were great, vegetables perfectly seasoned, all of the wonderful Indian spices you would want to have shined through, and the condiment sauces really let you personalize your dish.
I can't wait till the open more in other local cities."}
{"text":"Don't let the Indian part of the name fool you. Excellent food every time. I love chipotle but this is my new favorite. Definitely a good alternative as it is served chipotle style. I suggest getting the sauces on the side and just the tzatziki sauce on the bowl itself. You can definitely adventure in the sauces if you get them on the side. The food is always fresh, I stopped at random times of the day and was never disappointed. The food overall is definitely organic. Everything has a perfect seasoning. I have yet to use the salt shaker.  You don't have be feel adventurous as many ethnic places. This is definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and served hot.  Got the Chicken Tiki Masala bowl with brown rice.  Many various options available and the staff are helpful in assisting with recommendations and tasting.  Can't wait to return to try something different."}
{"text":"Definitely fast and the quality is good. We had bowls with lamb meatballs and naan bread. Staff was very friendly and quality decor and menu made it look like a much more expensive chain."}
{"text":"Keep it simple stupid
Stupid keep it simple
This place is great, fresh food and quick service. It's like chipotle but only better try it you'll love it"}
{"text":"So excited to have this place close to home. My wife visited India in college and she got me hooked on Indian food, and this is the first time I've had authentic Indian flavor in a fast casual setting. The Chipotle-style Indian food concept is awesomely done here. I had the chicken tikka masala bowl and added the tamarind date chutney, and the flavors really popped. Also tried some sides and chai tea, and it was all quite good.

Also, props to them for letting customers choose the spice level they want - I enjoy Indian flavors and a little spice, but I wouldn't enjoy authentic Indian (read: extreme) spiciness, so this was perfect. If I wanted it though, I could have had it.

We'll definitely be back for more tikka masala rice bowls! Hope this place sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Warm atmosphere. Awesome concept. Two thumbs up. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Walking into Bhelwala, you can instantly tell it follows Chipotle's fast-casual formula. You go down the line ordering rice bowl or wrap, then you select your proteins, veggies, and sauces. Even the layout and the industrial-modern decor of the interior is Chipotle-esque.

If you're unfamiliar with the process or the food, the employees are extremely helpful and more than willing to let you sample everything prior to ordering. The customer service was the best part of the experience. Everyone was friendly and genuine, and you could tell they put a lot of effort into trying to make this concept work, which makes the next part harder...

The food. It isn't good. I'm not an expert on Indian food, but I've tried enough from several places to know what *I* at least like, and sadly this place misses the mark. I was able to try the chicken tikka masala and lamb meatball with spinach masala. Both were bland, room temperature, and just way overpriced for what you get. And the naan was pretty obviously of the prepackaged, store-bought variety, just reheated on a flattop grill into a dry, stale disc.

I really wanted to like this place, but it unfortunately misses the mark where it matters most: the food. I love the excellent service and that they brought a different concept to an area that is otherwise oversaturated with tired ass chain restaurants, but I can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Two stars for trying to Americanize indian food but if you want true indian food try elsewhere.

Food was bland, like something you would get out of a box. Its almost as if the owners are afraid the public wont like true indian food. Shame on people who have never had indian food and think this is it.

This tastes as indian as taco bell tastes mexican."}
{"text":"Ok it brings me back to my fav cuisine Indian n street Indian food is no match to any cuisine for me :-) ...

So for this restaurant positives :
Good location
Clean place 
Nice ambiance
Food is well prepared 
Staff is very warm and friendly 

Shortcomings as I won't say they are negatives: 
It's not close to real street Indian food
It's like Indian chipotle 
They should also offer a original bhel Puri as many non Indian people coming will not know what all ingredients to put in their dish.
Should def expand on menu 

Will I visit again yes only if I'm in the area !"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Bhelwala. I try something new every time. The staff are very friendly and helpful. You can control how much spice you'd like by adding sauces and chutneys based in your own preferences. Not sure which sauces or toppings to add? Ask for a taste and they'll be happy to offer a sample. My latest favorite is a half-paneer/half-lamb meatball brown rice bowl. Don't forget the maggi sauce."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!!!! It was our first time to Bhelwala and the excellent staff walked us though every step of the prices and they were more than happy to let us sample anything we were unsure about it. I highly recommend checking them out!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was really friendly and happily walked us through the ordering process. It's set up like a Chipotle, where you choose a base, a protein, veggies and a chutney. Their recommendations were spot on. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"5 stars for the original idea alone!
We were in Strongsville for a skating event and the name caught my attention.  We are vegan which is not the easiest in this mediate area.
Their menu fully denotes Vegetarian, VeGan and Gluten Free... And where there was not a vegan sauce option, they made one for us!!
Everything tasted fresh.  The spices and chutneys were very flavorful, with the right hit of tang and spice.  The service is stellar.  And the price is amazing for both quality and quantity!
We sent a few skaters over and they liked it as much as we did.

3 choices: wrap, bowl or salad, then the sky's the limit of fillings, toppings, sauces and chutneys.  I really enjoyed the chick pea wrap with the coriander mint chutney and tiki masala!"}
{"text":"It is wonderful to finally have an Indian restaurant in town.  Chicken tikka rice bowl had an excellent flavor and texture.  It could have used more sauce, but will request more next time.  The chutney and breads were good also.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great concept.  Think Chipotle but Indian food.  Exactly the same idea.  The food was great, the staff was terrific.  It's different than an Indian buffet.  You choose sauces and that had me wondering if it was too many different flavors in my bowl but it turned out fine.  I got the chutney on the side and even that went with the main courses I chose.  I also ordered a samosa.  Less than fresh but you couldn't make them from the order or people would be waiting around forever.  It was still good and I really liked it with my tamarind sauce.  

I really liked the choice of material for the bowl.  Cardboard is biodegradable.  I wish the plastic picnic ware followed suit, however.  They also serve the chutney in plastic and there's no place to recycle there.  It's not enough to deduct a star.  They made an effort here but could do a better job.  Try this place, it's a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed Imdian foods for many years. The food here was ok but nothing special. I have had better. The one striking thing is the food is way overpriced."}
{"text":"I think this place will do great in its location in Strongsville. There isn't anything like it really and it provides nice fresh food. The employees were so helpful and informative. The lady explained everything to me and let me taste before making my bowl. 

I took my bowl to go and was eating my naan on my way home. The naan had little flavor and was a little too soft for my liking.

The lamb meatballs were absolutely amazing and I love how they have okra, veggies and different sauces to choose from.

It's not my favorite Indian place but it does satisfy the craving for indian food."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious!  I love the different options!  Anyone can eat here - vegetarians, meat-eaters, spice lovers, and people who cry at the smallest piece of a red pepper flake!  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  We have tried a lot of recommended dishes and haven't tried one that we didn't love!  I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Bhelwala's was fast, convenient, and filling - I had enough leftovers after stuffing my face for a second meal later in the day (or for my husband to steal...grrr). If I lived nearby this would be an easy to-go repeat. The food and options were tasty; I loved the paneer (they gave me a lot and I was sooo excited about it) and the Tikka sauce was good as well. I wasn't a huge fan of the naan, but they don't bake it in house- which is normally the draw for me anyways. It's priced a little high for the concept. I think, but for the amount of food you get I can accept that. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and quick to provide samples and answer questions to those apprehensive about the food/combinations - my mom and brother really appreciated this. 

Anyone writing reviews complaining that this isn't authentic Indian food, please quit. It doesn't claim to be. Appreciate it for what it is and take the time to USE YELP and find what you think is \"authentic Indian food\" in CLE. It's great that you can walk in, get a quick Indian fix with less than $10 and 5 minutes of your time, which would be unheard of somewhere that is \"authentic\". Great place!"}
{"text":"Great service, even better food. Should be a single $, not $$. Don't be afraid to try something new and check this place out."}
{"text":"Chipotle for Indian food.  I wasn't impressed.  Service was nice, but super slow.  I'm not sure there is a way to fix that either because unless you know what all the sauces are etc. it needs to be explained.  

I had the chicken tikka rice bowl.  Naan.  Had a couple sauces on the side as well.  And a mango lassi.  The chicken was overcooked and dry.  The rice was mushy.  Sauces were bland.  I enjoyed the naan.  

I like the concept, but it didn't work for me."}
{"text":"An amazing concept, great food and service, can't ask for anything else. I look forward to visiting the restaurant again. This restaurant is a must try!! There's nothing like it in the area. Make sure to try the Chicken Tikka Bowl!!!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I was unsure about Indian food. I'm a picky eater but wanted to try something new. Soooo glad I did!
Like others said, this is similar to chipotle or piada. The staff is super helpful and explain what everything is as you go down the line. The girl helping me not only said what was in each item, but informed me of her favorites and allowed me to try a small spoonful first.
This was a great experience and so yummy. I may be back tomorrow!"}
