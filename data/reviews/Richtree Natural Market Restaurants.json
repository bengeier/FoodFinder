{"text":"Great place, with a wide selection. You really can't go wrong with whatever you pick. It has something for everyone. It's more expensive than most places in the mall, but the quality more than makes up for that."}
{"text":"Not enough choices of food. Everything was made really dry. Wish there were less \"popular\" choices of cuisine like burgers, steaks and seafood."}
{"text":"I've been there as a reunion of friends a couple of weeks ago.
Actually it is a very good place for gathering and reunion party.The decoration is fantastic and i really loved it.
The good thing for a group is that every one get a card and can order whatever like beverage,different kind of food and every time they charge your card and at the end every one can pay her own bill separately.
The verity of food are limited and the quality are medium.
The server are not friendly!I had to wait to order a beer in the bar part for 15 min because no one was there.
The prices are reasonable but don't look for a very special food there.
Just a good place for group."}
{"text":"Tried to go for dinner last night and the place was closed. Sign in window shows place is For Lease so unlikely to reopen!"}
{"text":"Pay card system is awkward. Employees are rude and will question you if you want to leave like you are shop lifting. Food and drink is expensive and quality is not that good. Tables are not clean."}
{"text":"I didn't know what I wanted one Saturday evening and I asked the staff member at the pizza station what all the pizzas were. Then I asked her \"which one is better?\" Just to get her opinion. With quite the look on her face, she responded: \"Good question, let me know when you're ready.\" and walked away. Then I said: \"I was just asking you for your opinion.\" And she responded from far away: \"Yep I can hear you.\" SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RUDE! I couldn't believe my eyes and ears. I will NEVER EVER EVER go there again!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place but it was a huge let down. They had lots of choices for fun but few looked appealing. Ending up getting the hangover burger. It is a burger with egg, mushrooms and peameal bacon on it. The burger meat was terrible, it had no flavour to it at all and the texture to it was like it was boiled to cook it. For a $15 burger I expected a lot more, I would not go back and wouldn't recommend it with so many other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Couldn't agree more with the previous few posts - this place is OVERPRICED with LOUSY SERVICE and they have the temerity to charge a 10% gratuity for self-serve!  

Stay away - instead, patronize a local family run restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved the look and feel of the restaurant, but the food was so horrible!  My brother got steak and potatoes and he said the potatoes were at least a day old - and he's not a fussy eater. I am on a raw food cleanse and figured the salad bar would be a safe bet...NOPE!  There was virtually nothing that wasn't cooked!!!! Potato salad, beets, chick pea salad, cous cous...they had a coleslaw that I was going to dig into until I tasted it!  It tasted seriously \"off\" - but the gril assured me it was just my tastebuds!  All I could eat was plain lettuce, a couple of sad looking tomatoes, a bit of cucumber (not much there) and olives. So crazy!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.

Having visited the old Richtree at Brookfield Place several times in the past, we expected something similar here.  But this location is a noisy, drafty place, not unlike an airport cafeteria, with bad music blaring loudly.  It's as if the management deliberately designed the space to maximize 'turns'.  Well, we ate our meals, and quickly 'turned' ourselves out of there without coffee or dessert."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch with family. This place hasn't changed at all. The people that work there are still not the friendliest. The food there is still pretty bad. 

You walk in and they give you a blank card. You go to each station and you give them your card where they scan in your items that you have decided upon. It is a fantastic idea. The one downtown is amazing...but this one...not so much. 

My experience:
I went and got a small plate of \"pick your own salad\" bar. The potato salad was not seasoned, the pasta salad had way too much red onions in it...should i go on? For the main I went to the pasta section. The lady that was there was rude. She was just standing there, not cooking another customers dish and she told me that she was busy and to come back in 20 minutes. I walked around didn't see anything else I wanted so I went back in 25 minutes. She looked at me like I was annoying her. I ordered my chicken pasta in white sauce. I asked if I could have more vegetables in it instead of pasta and she said no. I told her that I would pay extra if needed. She said no it was against policy. I stood there waiting for her to finish making my dish. She didn't start working on it until she noticed that I was still standing there after 5 minutes.  I guess she didn't want me to watch her make my food since she told me to go back to my seat and she would bring me my pasta.

I went back to my seat. Sat there for 30 minutes waiting for her to basically warm up already cooked pasta, in a sauce that is already made, with chicken that is already cooked and mix it in with veggies that need to be sauteed. 

Do i need to say anymore from this point on? Paying for my bill was one of the most painful things I've had to do in a long time...not coming back to this location...ever."}
{"text":"When you walk in and see the \"plastic jungle/forest\" decor, it's a perfect indication of what the food is going to be like.... not good, but not bad enough to be offensive.  Until you pay, that is.   The prices are closer to fine dining but the food is closer to glorified high school cafeteria fare.

The only reason to go here is because it's at Bayview and York Mills, and there aren't many other choices nearby.  But this is car-country, not walking-territory, so drive a little further up Leslie and go to the Keg for about the same price."}
{"text":"I used to love this place cause they have some pretty good food.

But there is this one worker that was very disrespectful towards me. The other day I went in to grab something sweet since I was having a bad day and this guy just makes my day a thousand times worse. 

The other workers helped me get what I wanted at the end and were really nice but no body should be treated like that and I refuse to return there ever again. 

I don't feel like the food is even worth it anymore. Lets be honest there are plenty of other stores that are way better at square one."}
{"text":"I went to the Richtree Restaurant at College Park for lunch. It was extremely disappointing. I had the seafood paella which was definitely not fresh. Ingredients of low quality and tasteless rough rice. I didn't eat much of it and still ended up with stomach ache that stayed with me over 2 days! My husband had the burger which wasn't as harmful but definitely not special and not quality meat at all. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"This Richtree is unlike what used to be the Marche. The first thing that I notice is the price here is expensive. Not only is it expensive but more money than the other Richtree that I visit like the one in downtown Brookfield Place. A 12 oz juice costs $5+. The dessert crepe $10.45. Those desserts being displayed look a bit stale. The Bouillabaisse is not seafood based soup but tomato paste with seafood dumped in. The Farmers crepe with the sausage, ham cold.  The desserts displayed have no cover and bugs are flying over the top!  A tea costs $3

The cook did not know how to cook. May be they are servers as well as Cook.  An order of blended blueberry banana orange juice  does not have blueberry taste as only 3 or 4 blueberries are used. The server has to try the juice herself before giving it to us. No good.  She has to make another one. 

It really likes street market, not Richtree!"}
{"text":"I bought at Ramen in Richtree Natural Market Eaton Centre  the Pork Tonkatsu Ramen at $10.99 plus tax.  This is the worst ever Ramen I have tasted in GTA Toronto.

The soup is no way pork stew soup.  It is water with a lot of salt and msg.  The noodle is not good quality Ramen.   4 pieces of pork is ok but not tender at all.  The vegetable is Chinese broccoli but already with flowers open - old ones.  The egg though acceptable is not comparable to Ramen available nearby downtown.

With that price and quality,  highly NOT recommended"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best spot in downtown to eat healthy lunches.
I go there when I go shop to my favourite winners and it is also very convenient because it is just upstairs my subway station.
Recommended!"}
{"text":"The salad bar is a complete rip off. $10 for a TINY plate, it's like they are discouraging customers from making healthy choices"}
{"text":"Had the hard tacos which comes in 3's. Had a choice of chicken, pork, or beef; I  got one of each. Came with all the fixens: guac, salsa, rice, beans, grilled vegetables, mozzarella, and corn salsa. 

Beef was the best, with the most flavor. Chicken and pork were fairly good. A note for next time to get the soft tacos at they were bigger and fit more inside.

Paid $11+tax with a bottle of water. Very good value. Will definitely eat here again next time I'm at the mall."}
{"text":"This place has become a joke. We ate there last week and my wife and daughter both got food poisoning from the seafood. They both were treated for salmonella and were in pain for days. I complained online only to receive a call from the manager saying that he had never received such a complaint before so it wasn't his fault.

The food quality is mediocre at best, the prices are high and the service is nonexistent. It's such a shame because we used to enjoy going to this chain but will never set foot it in again."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place a lot about 7 years ago, but everything about it has gone way downhill since then. I wouldn't come back here unless it's for a crepe or something. It's empty at 7pm on a Friday for a reason..."}
{"text":"Thanks to this place, I can' afford lunch , The food  is okay and the prices ridiculous. To think I can get a foot long sub at Subways for $5.00.
Way too expensive that it ruins enjoying the middle grade product produced by this place."}
{"text":"First time to take my daughter to this place, I used to go there quite a lot in the early 2000, but then, we didn't go as we found that their price is a bit too high but the quality of the food does not qualify with that. 

We had a kid's pizza and a Grilled Salmon today. 
My daughter couldn't finish the kid's size pizza, even though it's kid's size, it's till too big though. But at least, she enjoyed it and ate 2/3 of it. I found the salmon was well grilled and I love it. It was served with stirred fried rice, which is pretty good, but not as good as expected. 

We didn't have any space for dessert (TOO BAD) , but surely they are very attractive and we will surely try again next time. (for just dessert!)"}
{"text":"My first time in Toronto and my friend brought me here. She knew I would love it. She knows me so well. 

All sorts and types of cuisine-sushi, Italian, seafood, sandwiches, omelets...all made to order! I must have walked around to each section, contemplating whether I wanted omelets more, or some fresh sandwich/ quiche and soup. Being on a weekend, this place was busy. Line ups at every stall. 

In the end (probably about 15 minutes and lots of debating), I finally settled on a bouillabaisse. Yes, a bouillabaisse here. I suddenly had the craving. And so I place my order, and wait patiently as they gather up the ingredients to my dish. 

After about 10 minutes or so, the cook opened up the pot, and it was all ready! Large pieces of fish, mussels, clams.....in a piping hot tomato soup base. It was a big portion too! 

The dessert section here was awesome. Sadly, I was too full to try any of it. Love the whole concept of choose what you want to eat, all cooked to order. Some prices are higher than usual, and others seem more reasonable. 

For what I paid for this, and the deliciousness of this dish, I want to go back here now!"}
{"text":"Walking around to grab your own food items... that's one way to work up an appetite.

It's like a nice-looking, non-subsidized cafeteria for professionals.

Instead of tater tots you have rosti.
There aren't any chicken fingers, instead there is roasted, curry, or jerk chicken.
Who needs a jello cup when there are chocolate covered strawberries, crepes, and delicious cakes.

This is probably my favorite lunch spot.

I'm a big fan of their soups.  
The squash soup is sweet with cinnamon and spices.
The lentil soup has curry powder which warms you up in the winter.

I'm an even bigger fan of their salad bar.
I can get a small salad for $4. Cheapest and best salad in the area for lunch.  Kale, lentil, corn, beets, pasta, potato, carrot, they have a few items to choose from.

And if I have to bring a coffee cake anywhere, the cakes from here are always a hit.

Yay, Marche! Er.. Richtree."}
{"text":"You're craving ramen. You're in the Eaton Centre. You see the sign at Richtree Natural Market and consider pulling out your wallet at the ramen station. 

Don't do it. Walk away. Get something else, anything. 

I got the Tori Taitan Chicken and the meat was gross. Overprocessed slab of (boiled in bath water?) meat. Broth was tasteless. Noodles were blah. 33 cent instant noodles would be better. 
."}
{"text":"We bought 2 muffins and a custard square last Sat at Richtree. The muffins ($1.99 not cheap) was so horrible with lot of baking soda and no taste at all....causing a strong bitter taste in my mouth. It was my 1st time to throw a muffin away. The custard square tag said with strawberry. But after digging the whole block of custard, there was only 2 tiny pieces of strawberry inside!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite when you don't feel like \"fast food\" or going to a \"sit down restaurant\" ... as far as food court food goes, this place is pretty damned good."}
{"text":"I like going here to sit on the swings and have a coffee and mango muffin. It's nice when it's not busy. Sometimes they are understaffed and it's hard to get what you want without waiting for a long time. Sometimes the place is filled with screaming kids.. so it's sort of hit or miss depending on when you go."}
{"text":"I've walked miles out of my way to get a coffee and muffin here. They have coconut muffins, which are unusual and I love their machine coffee. The workers are friendly too. The seating area is never crowded and is a civilized place to enjoy your food. They have free wifi. You can also sit outside in the courtyard with an umbrella. Richtree is a civilized oasis in a hostile world."}
{"text":"My first visit, truly I was looking for another place that is no longer here i discovered. I was up for a big breakfast but here has a small selection. Cheap prices and quick service in a market area that as shops the offer a big variety. In the specific case of the Breakfast spot in the Market, i give my 3 stars, not exciting."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Toronto and my bestie's 4th (maybe 5th, she's kind of obsessedd) time so it wasn't  our first time checking out the yumminess that Marche/Richtree Markets has to offer.

     I went for the Rösti Potato with their special sausage of the day which to my pleasant surprise happened to be veal, rawr =).  Rösti is apparently a traditional Swiss dish that consists of grated (sometimes raw) potatoes that are lightly baked or fried and then shaped into a round patty like thing using a frying pan that measures between 1-6 inches (probably 8-12 inches in America since I apparently live in the land of obesity and fatass-ness). Sometimes people use other ingredients like butter, herbs, seasonings, bacon and/or cheese but this depends on the region...the particular rösti that I enjoy in Toronto uses no such ingredients, just plain good ol' yummy potato and the sexy veal sausage which was insanely flavorful and featured a lightly crispy skin =).

     My best friend opted for Richtree's seafood savory soup/stew concoction and what I believe was a slice of cheesecake...but don't quote me. She did scarf it down and left no crumb behind so my guess if that it was really tasty."}
{"text":"We got breaded tilapia and it was semi translucent on the inside. Raw fish seems like a health hazardous when consumed. They recooked the fish but didn't really acknowledge the associated risk."}
{"text":"The service at this place is not very good. The staff look tired and not interested in working there. Not cheap either so one would expect at a smile right? The food is borderline passable in general with the soup being quite tasty however their seafood section leaves something to be desired. This restaurant needs a lot of improvement and new management!"}
{"text":"The food is certainly overpriced, but the food is decent and the ingredients are fresh. I would recommend the crepes or the make-your-own pasta station."}
{"text":"Can be hit-or-miss but some menu items (like the rosti, the fresh stirfrys, and the desserts) are comforting and well prepared. 

An slightly more expensive lunch option despite being self-serve, but the people who work there are always very friendly. 

The morning deal (coffee and muffin) and evening discounts are great value."}
{"text":"The Richtree Market vends itself as the Eaton's Centre's answer to Movenpick's Marché, but is a wolf in sheep's clothing. After some particularly bad sushi (I should know better than to get mall sushi, really) I gave their \"authentic\" Mexican \"food truck\" a go. My burrito was completely bland, no trace of picante, lime or cilantro... authentic say whaaa? It is of course noisy there due to its location, but I was also redirected from two different cash registers to pay for my meal the second time - which really should have all been open given how busy it was; they get some of the Bay Streeters for lunch."}
{"text":"$11 mediocre smoked salmon sammiches...

$10 mediocre tiny quiche-and-salad combos....

$Unknown-but-certainly-overpriced juices...

$Tip for fast-food dining....

Do not want.

Cheesecakes and crepes are the redeeming graces. And even those are overpriced."}
{"text":"This past weekend, my parents (who are in their 60s and reside in Winnipeg) were visiting me in Toronto. We chose to go to Richtree because it seemed like a convenient location for me (who resides downtown) and my aunt and uncle (who reside in Thornhill). Another decision factor in selecting a restaurant was that we were organizing our plans rather last minute and did not have any dinner reservations. Richtree seemed like a logical choice because it is a casual atmosphere which does not require a reservation. 

One frequent complaint from those of my parents vintage is that most restaurants that they have frequented in the past have noise levels which are uncomfortably too loud for their taste. Add to the fact that my aunt has some partial hearing impairment, meant that noise level was a concern when selecting a place to dine. My concerns regarding noise level were validated upon setting foot in the restaurant. As a result of the open concept nature of the restaurant, throughout much of the evening, I felt as if I was straining to hear the conversation at the other end of the table. While the food itself was adequate (I ordered a regular pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers), my overall satisfaction with the restaurant was significantly negatively affected by the high levels of ambient noise. Thus, it is unlikely that I will visit this restaurant in the future and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone else who is looking for a quiet dining experience."}
{"text":"Oh no! Don't go here!

I recently was dragged here with a friend because it was the only place open for a late night coffee. I ended up wanting a juice and had to ask an employee where their \"juice bar\" was located, since they advertise their freshly squeezed juice. The lady pointed towards a mini fridge with 2 juices in plastic containers about a size of a cup, which is quite a good amount...BUT NOT FOR 6 DOLLARS?! Also, it was obvious that the juices had been sitting there for a while. I decided to skip that and just go for a plain reg. coffee. As I go for checkout, I ended up paying $5 for a REGLAR COFFEE! The resto is not only overpriced but they also charge you an additional fee for serving and waiting on yourself apparently. Such a turn off.

Besides this fact, the actual resto needs a complete tear down. It's very old and very dirty. Don't go here, it's a complete waste of your money!"}
{"text":"I will still call this Marche's, and this is one that I have not been to. Located in York Mills Centre, it's probably one of the smallest ones I have ever been to. I wanted to go to the one right in downtown where the Hockey Hall of Fame was, but that one was closed due to renovation. Everytime I come back to Toronto, I always have to at least come here once and have my picking of all the fresh food in this market style restaurant environment.

Probably due to size, I was actually let down a bit by the selection of food the time I went. I ended up having a mixed omellette, and the mushrooms were not that fresh. And this location didn't have raw shucked oysters. Other than that, the experience of coming to these places is real good, as where I'm from, if something like this opened, I think it would be a great success.

Hopefully next time when I come back to Toronto, my experience here will be better, I don't doubt it."}
{"text":"I was debating between two or three stars.  It's an A-okay place for breakfast / brunch, because the pastries and coffee are decent and the swing chairs add a nice weekend fun touch.  That says three-star.   

But the food is.....so middle-of-the-road unimaginative and unchanged over the years.  The same Rosti dishes, pastas, meat grilling station doing the same thing and fish fillet cooked the same boring way, not sure if a few pseudo Asian fusion-y dishes are meant to jazz things up, certainly not kicking up the excitement level for me.  Given Toronto's culinary breadth and depth, this place becomes an afterthought or not-thought-of-at-all too easily.

I hope this place sticks around and find ways to improve as it is a convenient location.  More energy, more imagination, please."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Marche, before they changed it to Richtree. Pricey if you are comparing it to food court food, but well worth every penny. Farmers Market feel, amazing food (Highly recommend the Smoked Salmon and Rosti, Quiche, Baked Ziti, Oven Pizza, and the Muffins are deadly delicious)"}
{"text":"Such a great little spot to go for lunch if you work in the area. The patio is cute and tucked away in College Park and has $5 pints. The best deal in the mornings is a coffee and muffin for $2.89. The muffins are baked fresh (the coconut is my personal facourite!) and the coffee is more like an americano. It's made fresh from an espresso machine. Really good quality and lots of deals (2 for 1 meals after 5)."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the middle of Eaton centre that usually gets overlooked. I got some of their savoury crepes and they were good. There was nothing too special, but it definitely it better than some of the stuff you get in the lower level. Lots of vegetarian options as well. Not a lot of seating, especially during lunch hours it gets packed."}
{"text":"You have lots of healthy options here and prices are decent. Certain things are not as good so choose wisely. Overall its alright"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for their for 2 for 1 end of day sale which happens after 5pm. The food is really underwhelming but for the prices I paid, I can't really complain. I've walked around during lunch time and their food looks a million times better. Their lunch prices aren't bad but somehow I've never managed to pull the trigger when I worked downtown. 

I've had pizza and boxed pasta. The pizza were terrible. Massive slices of non-fluffy bread. It's what bread tastes like when it's not fresh. The toppings were flavorless. The pasta was alright. Definitely not the best pasta I've had and it's best described as edible. Some of the pasta pieces were \"hard\" since they've been in the heater all day. The sauce is also more gooey since a lot of the water has evaporated, leaving a very thick sauce. 

Of course, my complaint is not valid since I'm getting their end of day stuff at 2 for 1 prices. I'm sure it tastes at least slightly better during the day. The value to taste ratio is very good and it's very likely I'll return again and again when I'm really hungry and if I happen to be around between 5-6pm. I'm simply not picky."}
{"text":"I miss working downtown and being able to get their fresh coffee and muffins each morning. Then indulging myself in their pastas. It's like fast food but with natural ingredients. 

I've never been sure why Marche rebranded itself to Richtree, and I'll never understand it - I will always still refer to it as Marche, especially if it maintains the green and white stripped colour scheme, and decor as if you were in a market. 

Here's a condensed version of what you would find at their flagship on Front street. All these 'Richtree' (i.e. Marche Express) establishments still contain the same variety (which is not a lot) that the larger Marche also has (which is why I don't really understand the flag ship store). 

You have Pastas (2 types daily + 1 oven baked), Salads, Rotessirie Chicken (4 different flavours!), Bakery+Coffee, among others. One thing is for sure, they make all the food from scratch each morning - there's no processed food here. 

Prices are cheap enough to justify not bringing your lunch every day. 

Today I got a Half Chicken (two 1/4s) with rice and veggies (ask them to pour gravy on from the other chicken flavours) $9.50 (a quarter chicken meal like this is $7). 
I've always been a big fan of Marche Chicken - the skin is crispy and salty the way it should be. 

Payment after you gathered your food is easy, except seems crowded and hard to maneuver. 

Snag a seat, and there's also free water for you as well."}
{"text":"I love their salad bar, which offers beet root salad, pasta salad, Greek salad, couscous salad, corn salad, bean salad, lettuce salad, etc. A small salad which costs $3.79 would fill me right up for lunch. 

I've tried their jerk chicken, but I'm not a big fan because it has a sweet and spicy taste. The sweet taste threw me off, it tasted good, but... Not what I was expecting. 

Had their muffins, it's pretty good, not too sweet and freshly baked daily.

They also have an end of the day sale, where it's buy one get one free for several different items including the small salad, muffin, juice and desserts."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service at the Rosti station. My wife and I were keen on eating there earlier today but the employees at the rosti station were busy doing their work without realizing the presence of customers. I can understand how busy they can get but it was only after I asked them on how long will it take, I got a 14 mins wait as a reply from one of the staff and nothing beyond that. I didn't even place our order and she didn't even bother to check whether we've ordered or not. Eating out is not always about the food, the service also goes a long way and I will neither dine at such a place ever again nor will I recommend it to anyone else. Food court stalls that are busier offer better customer service."}
{"text":"There was 2 for 1 crepes. End of story."}
{"text":"I passed by this place a lot, they have a few locations. I finally went to the Square One one with my work team and I must say I wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped. When I finally settled on a meal, a beef fettucini alfredo, I was told they don't have any more beef and so I had to choose something else for the pasta. The team seemed nice but clearly very tired and unenthusiastic. The pasta was a bit bland and the alfredo sauce was watery and there wasn't much of it. I was starved so I finished the portion, a decent size. My workmates mostly had rosti dishes, the ones with the smoked salmon liked it but admitted the rosti was a bit cold and the plate overall a bit dry. Another of my co-workers had the rosti with the bbq chicken which he loved and said the sauce made the dish much less dry. What really disappointed me though was that they closed their waffle/crepe dessert section early. After we finished our meals we all headed to the crepe station and we were told it's almost closing time so the station is closed. That's just it...it was 15 minutes before closing and no one came to the dining area to let us know about last calls, they just closed off early. What's the point of having operating hours if you're not really fully operating within them? There was also no signage to say certain stations stop production/close earlier than others so we just felt a bit short changed in our experience. If it was maybe 5 minutes before closing it would have been less of a surprise but 15 minutes is a solid chunk of of an hour. If there was signage that would also be okay, but the dining areas were full so it was unexpected. That being said, the employees did seem exhausted so we felt for them."}
{"text":"I've had the food here and it's fairly average and quite pricey.  However, it looks fresh, it's clean and has that upscale market feel.  I don't really like the entrees here.  

So why the 3 stars instead of 1 or 2? Their muffins and coffee!!!!

OMG! These muffins are freshly made and 10X better than Timmy's (try the mango coconut or the peach) and they give you a medium sized coffee, all for only $2.29!! This is cheaper than Tim's!!  Love this place for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Prices are outrageous, staff are rude,except for nice hostesses, and best food is the squash soup, chicken and Caesar salads. We once saw a cockroach crawling through the pasta! Beautiful restaurant though."}
{"text":"IT'S NOT FRESHER JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE THEM MAKE IT IN FRONT OF YOU.

We have been to other Richtrees before without incident. The food is always mediocre, the queues long and the food overpriced but our daughters enjoy going station to station so periodically, we go.  

We went to this one in North York for the first time ever at 11:45 recently. We entered and no one welcomed us in nor asked us if we are familiar with the Richtree concept. We wandered around and had to sit ourselves down, get our own cutlery and colouring books.  It was confusing because we didn't know which tables were truly available and which were left empty because someone had stepped away.  Turned out that the colouring books were used. 

Most of the stations were not opened yet for lunch. Only the breakfast omelette station was truly opened. Only by 12:00 was the pizza station just getting warmed up and the Italian sandwich station opening up. We then were told the pasta station would not open until around 1pm as they were still serving eggs at that station. The kids were starving so we caved and got them the only available lunch item - the pre-made Italian sandwiches. We asked to talk to a manager and waited and waited. Some guy eventually showed up and started to put the blame on us saying that he cannot accomodate one client for lunch when everyone else is eating breakfast. Again, it was past noon! Never again."}
{"text":"Thank god they did everyone a favor and shut down. This place probably won the second place in bad service after Boston pizza. They were always short staffed and therefore had to get other chefs to take over stations/booths they didn't belong to, and hence they didn't know how to properly make the other station's items. There was this one time the french chef had to take over the pasta booth because there was no one to do it, and he made my beef fettuccini wrong 3 times. I told the manager every time yet the manager offered absolutely no compensation, not even an apology. I ate my food an hour after all of my friends had finished their meal. I was so mad i emailed their company that night but they never replied. That manager should definitely be demoted, he had the whole place running like a circus."}
{"text":"Richtree is a good place to go with groups or if you're just grabbing something on the go. Right at the corner of Bayview and York Mills, it's in a shopping plaza with heaps of parking spots. It's conveniently located close to the 401. I like the layout and the cafeteria style - you go to stations, order your food, and bring it back to your table. Just make sure not to lose your card. The best thing here is the pizza as it's made in a \"wood oven.\" Their crepes are pretty good too - after 9:00 PM, you can get a second plain crepe for 50% of the original price. This place is \"safe\" as there's something for everyone.

Good for: groups, pizza, crepe"}
{"text":"I haven't been ages and it seems like the quality of food has gone down a bit. The cesaer salad that I loved was way too salty and the lettuce was old. The smoked salmon rostti and crepe were still good but not as amazing as I remembered it to be. However, services is superb all staff are very nice."}
{"text":"This chain has gone downhill, but this location in particular.  They opened 2 hours prior to our arrival and all the breakfast items weren't ready yet. 

The woman who served me at the first station made it seem like she was doing me a favour by not charging me for toast, which I pointed out the sign read \"comes with all breakfasts\". She continued to inform me it was of that I could have toast, but she still usually charged extra.    

Then off to get a coffee.  There was a sign saying at this time you could get a coffee and a muffin for 2.79. So I ordered a coffee and a muffin.   When I went to pay, they were billed separately.   Apparently you have to ask for them to come as the \"coffee and a muffin\" special.    

This will be my last trip to any richtree."}
{"text":"Came here for a small meal Sunday afternoon. I've been to Richtree a couple times over a year ago, but haven't been back since their renovation. 

They have plenty of choices - sandwiches, pasta, tacos, baked goods, etc. You walk around to the various stations, order/pickup what you want, and then pay before seating. Richtree is definitely more expensive than regular fast food places in the mall, but it does taste fresher too.  

I ordered the rosti with fried tilapia - they were out of tilapia unfortunately so I just had the plain rosti along with sour cream. I've only had rosti a few times so I'm not an expert, but it's essentially a European dish of pan-fried shredded potatoes. It was tasty, especially after seasoning more with salt/pepper. Reasonably priced at $5. 

My friend wanted a fresh fruit juice but for some reason, what they had available wasn't cold. So she got a veggie sandwich only (contained cheese, red pepper, and spinach) which she enjoyed but felt was overpriced at $10."}
{"text":"Tried the Butchery's Cajun pita $8.99. Chicken meat taste good but meat is quite hard. The rest of the family tried the Ramen one and was ok meaning basic fast food quality so it is nothing like the authentic restaurants. The soup base with miso tastes better though. Good atmosphere on a Sunday."}
{"text":"This area is dangerous. 
Every time I'm driving through it, I immediately crave a Rosti! 
Check out today's craving"}
{"text":"Richtree is a conglomeration of just about every type of food you can think of. It's sandwiches, Asian food, breakfast, dessert...

Just stopped in for a beer at the bar and some classic Canadian poutine. It was good and salty, as expected. The beer was a vanilla stout of some sort but quite good."}
{"text":"This is a great concept. I love the idea of being able to go around with a card but then pay at the end. You kind of feel like a millionaire temporarily. Just temporarily though, the prices are a lot when you check-out at the end.

Everything looks A LOT better then it tastes...The best thing there was the pizza and crepe. Dessert was horrifying and would never order again. My GF had to switch her cake.

My pasta was absolutely overpowered by garlic flavor and was something I can make at home in 2 minutes. I doubt I will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Not much of a variety of food to choose from.  Food wasn't too bad but could be better.  The decor was the only interesting thing I really liked about the restaurant.  I don't think I'd go back.  This was chosen because it was convenient for a certain person who was a part of our group."}
{"text":"Here's what I ordered:

3 eggs over easy - got it burnt to a crisp and the yolks were all broken
An order a sausage - swimming in grease and they charged $4 for 2 sausages 
Fresh mango juice - it was sugar water. Maybe the water they use to mix was fresh.  
Latte - the coffee has no taste and I think the milk the used was a little off

Threw everything out and Had to go over to Tim Hortons across the hall. Got a coffee to wash the bad taste in my mouth. 

I usually try to find some positive thing to say about any place. I just couldn't find any on this one. The staff seemed overwhelmed and lost somehow. 

Sorry.....this is the second Richtree I tried and I think I'm done."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place has become better or worse since they changed from Marche. Everything is still the exact same. You still have to pay way too much to eat here. The food is still not worth what you're paying. Not even close. The serving size is still ridiculously tiny for how much you're paying. Pretty much. You pay way too much for if anything, average food that you can get elsewhere. I do have to say that the muffins here are a blessing in disguise which is probably why I bump them up to a 2 star. Do not eat here. Spend your money on better restaurants."}
{"text":"I generally like Richtree restaurants (see my other reviews for other locations) but this location is just absolutely brutal!

Maybe it's our fault for heading in at around 11 p.m. but dear god it was terrible. We get there, have their food has already been removed (they're supposed to stay open until 2 a.m.) and the ones on display are almost rotting. We sit down - and usually this is when a waiter notices and brings us utensils and napkins - but we get NO service until we ask them and they only bring us napkins... okay no biggie. Let's order some food!

I go to their chicken stand and wait there for almost a good minute thinking that the person taking care of the stand is probably just cooking something up but nope no one is there (nor is there anyone at the sushi stand beside ours) yet there are 5 employees just walking around making jokes with each other. So I ask one of the employees if he can help me, and he just goes to the back grabs a plate and just literally scoops a heap of their honey garlic chicken and dumps it on a half scoop of old rice and hands it to me... great service. (Oh not to mention that walking past their fish stand, they just had frozen fish in their plastic shrink wrap packaging on display... what the hell? I could just go to dominions next door and get the same thing for a couple dollars.. why pay so much here?)

As for the food itself... possibly one of the WORST foods I've ever had in my life.. the chicken was pretty much ALL just bone chunks and the sauce was soo sticcky from sitting out in the open for so long and I couldn't take it... okay maybe their dessert will be better?

We go and look at their cakes, my guest asks what kind of cake a certain one was and the guy just looks at it and swats his hand and a good 30 - 40 fruit flies just disperse into the air.. and that leaves us noticing that the cake now looks COMPLETELY different haha so we decide to have some fresh made crepes, can't go wrong with that right? Well turns out when we order a crepe we get a waffle... I was so pissed off that this point I didn't even want to say anything else and just get out of there as quickly as possible!!!

Regardless I'm not going back to this location ever again.. it was a great place when it used to be Marche but now it's just downright awful! (Not to mention that we paid almost $25 / person for this SH$TTY MEAL!! AARRGGH)"}
{"text":"I like it here.  Sometimes i come in and get potato rosti to go.  That's really what i get here most of the time.  Their desserts look soooo good.  I always think I want a crepe or waffle, but I never quite get to it.

Conceptually, I don't like the idea of getting my own food and seating myself and paying a gratuity, but when you get it to go, it's not a problem.

Their pizza here is good too."}
{"text":"I don't know why I love Rich Tree so much but I always do

(always fun memories)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has relocated to the lower level at Square One.
I used to love going here, but since the move, all I can say is, \"I won't be back!\"
Half the good stuff they used to carry is gone. The pasta was way better upstairs!
Really gone down hill! 
Won't be back again, ever. 
With all the new choices around the Food Court, I know where I'll be going from now on!
BTW, the pizza slice I had today, because I was with others was terrible. Cold! Instead of tomato sauce it seemed more like a marinara sauce. Awful!
(UPDATE: my daughter was sick after eating the chicken .......... Food poisoning???? Really, not good anymore!)"}
{"text":"The steak we got was undercooked, and it tasted burnt.  All I could taste was charcoal from the grill because the cook seared it continously on the same spot that had a high flame.

There was barely any seasoning

From a food safety standpoint, the raw steak was placed on the same surface as one that used for cooked food.  I saw the cook place the raw steak on the mat, use a knife to cut the package, took the steak from the package with the same tongs that were used to grab cooked burgers from the grill.  This plastic cutting mat was the same one that was used where cooked roasted chicken was placed lying flat before it was cut.  

Even though the steak was medium rare, it tasted burnt.  All I can taste is burnt charcoal hours after this meal. 



An unpleasant meal and I won't be back.  Disappointing that this meal was $17.99 plus taxes."}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Richtree in square one when it used to be above the food court but have never actually dined in at the new location. I am a frequent buyer of their freshly squeezed orange juice though. It's so damn expensive but soooo good! I only drink my oranges freshly squeezed lol.

Today the BF and I decided to lunch here instead of the food court because there seemed to be \"healthier\" options. Everything looked so good! I decided on a chicken stir-fry and he got a burger with fries. Everything is made to order right in front of you. The stir-fry has a good chicken to veggie ratio and they don't fill the bowl with too much rice. I also enjoyed everything they put in the stir fry. Onions, carrots, broccoli, peppers and I think they use kale? The sauce options are, spicy Thai, citrus teriyaki and I can't remember what the third one was lol. I got spicy Thai. The sauce was a bit too salty and I think that's my only complain regarding my dish. My bfs burger was a little burnt so the taste was a bit off. However, he still thought it was pretty ok. Fries were delicious and they give you a great portion. Not stingy at all. 

I thought what we got was priced reasonably and is on par with what you would pay in a food court. Maybe even cheaper. Quality is great for what you pay, so I think it's worth it. I will for sure be coming back to try other dishes and of course for the orange juice!"}
{"text":"Lunch with mum after work :) it was amazing the food is awesome and great sitting areas and I will keep coming because the food is amazing and it's fun with family and friends !!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for a few years mostly because I enjoy the pseudo-European garden atmosphere, the unique seating and the crepes. The prices have certainly increased in the past little while however. I love plain crepes with chocolate and caramel sauce; I ordered this delectable dish last night and was very surprised to see that a ladle of batter and two squirts of sauce cost $7.29+tax! The apple one is a dollar or so more which is more reasonable considering they put almost two apples worth of slices in there, but ask for a strawberry crepe with a scoop of ice cream and you done been robbed at almost $20. That sort of thing just makes me angry. I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't 2-for-1 crepe night. The service was certainly lacking; I can understand that it was after 9:00pm on a Wednesday night so they probably don't expect a lot of customers mid-week but the employees who were working were just disinterested. There also didn't seem to be enough staff as there was nobody manning the coffee station (the most obvious thing for that time of night) and the two ladies doing the crepes looked overworked and totally unenthusiastic. My husband waited in front of the dessert bar for 8 minutes for a slice of cake. Since it didn't appear that anybody was going to help him and the crepe line was showing no sign of letting up I finally asked the girl at the front door (who was just occasionally handing out cards to a dwindling number of customers are well as running over to the coffee station from time to time) to help. She obediently went over to serve up the cake and that was settled. The servers clearing the tables were mostly cheery and efficient, but I feel overall that the service used to be better. I agree with others that the food isn't anything special; the only thing I usually eat is the rösti. They have started selling some organic snacks (jelly beans and nuts) but they are very expensive. The restaurant has about 5 small tables outside but the patio area faces the parking lot.  It is generally a nice place to gather and the food is decent, but just don't expect too much."}
{"text":"The restaurant is not so great. I would give it to out of five stars because first of all it is very noisy second of all they charge an extra 10% off service fee. I have the smoked salmon, And it was basically just three slices of very thin salmon with some potatoes on the side Which costed $12. Only giving it two stars because they are a variety of food from different cultures and there are many choices for you to pick from"}
{"text":"When you visiting Richtree's Market place, you have to expect the following things: 

1. self-service
2. so-so to ok food

If you go in with those expectations, you'll be fine. Marketplace offers a plethora of choices in terms of food stations, and you just go up and take a look at what each cooking stations offers. To the front, you've got the coffee stand, the bakery, sandwiches, juice bar, pizza bar, soup/rotisserie, next to the pastries/crepe/waffle/ice cream stations group in the front half of the restaurant. Then to the back of the restaurant, they've got the pasta/stir-fry bar, with the Rosti, seafood and Grill. 

Most recent visit, I was with about 10 other people and we were there from 7 to almost 11pm, which was fine, but you can tell the staff didn't want to be there. But the good part about that is that they do pretty much leave you alone, except to clear up your dishes off the table. Cutlery, plus trays, and water is all self-service. 

This visit, I ordered their special prime rib burger with fries, which was surprising was pretty good. Plus they cooked it according to how rare or not rare you want it. So for about 8.00, it wasn't bad and it was served with freshly cooked fries. The pasta and their steamed mussels, I would recommend skipping out on. Likewise most of their other stuff, but their desserts are ok, as well as their \"fresh bread\" if you are ever there during mid-day or in the morning.

Free Wi-fi is offered.

The minuses can and may or may not be limited to kids running around, which may or may not be to your perference; grouchy-faced employees; not exactly efficient service for your food; I think the BF's pasta took longer than it should have and it apparently wasn't that good. The portion was generous, but it is hard to choke down if it doesn't taste good or like anything.  The set up the place is kitchy, and different, but it hasn't changed in 10+ years, when it first opened as Movenpick Marche, before the dispute.  

The gimmick is deceptively simple, in giving you a card and you give it to the people manning th stations to swipe if you want something, and everyone gets one, when they walk in. The dangerous part is that you can end up paying more than you might want to, so keep track of what you order."}
{"text":"I hate to say that I am very disappointed in myself for not being able to set more time to visit with my cousin.  She had planned to take me up to the CN tower restaurant for dinner when we met downtown in Toronto but a second showing for our film proved to be a schedule changer and we had to have our meal in a more quicker place and not necessarily fast food.  

We have not seen each other in person in almost 18 years since her firstborn and now here I am visiting Toronto for the first time in many years and had to rush our dinner.  Truly, she looked great and definitely always a reflection of her mother's looks.  Truly wonderful and might be a good reason to revisit the city with Brian next time.

The restaurant she picked was an interesting place.  A concept not necessarily new.  A food card is provided and you went to a station to choose your food and the cost is added to your card and you wait for the preparation for your food.  The prices are pretty high but since its CDN (Canadian currency maybe not so much).  This was popular in a restaurant in Chicago years ago but it works well for a quick fresh meal.  My cousin got her shrimp with rice and I ordered the AA Sirloin steak well done (which took longer but worth it) with fries.  Truly the food itself was good, my cousin and I shared stories which contributed to a great dinner despite its brevity.  I tasted the rice and it was good and restaurant worthy.  After we finished our meal, it is not over until you have dessert.  She had coffee with tiramisu and I had the fruit tart with the café au lait.    

Being the visitor, my cousin paid and I will not forget the memories, the conversation and although hurried because of the schedule changes.  Nothing was worth more to me than being able to sit and talk with her about me, my partner, her current life.  It was not enough time but the place she took me allowed us to be ourselves without the pretensions of waiting for service and looking for a view.

When we review places, we try to let our friends know the perfect spot, the great service and most of all the value of the experience.  I am giving this place the most stars possible because of a good memory that shows me that the gap of time can be surpassed with good memories of the past, the present and the future."}
{"text":"2.5

Pros:
Large seating area

Cons:
Everything is pretty much meh

It is what it is.  That's basically how I describe Richtree in general.  If you've been once, you know exactly what to expect any other time you go.  Richtree has stayed the same from the first time I went years ago all the way up till now.  It never changes anything drastically.  It will never ever surprise you, but at the same time, it shouldn't ever disappoint you because you have no expectation either.

This location at Bayview and York Mills is probably the most quiet location.  It's got a large seating area where sound doesn't seem to travel real well, which is a good thing.  You can easily have a quiet conversation where at the other Richtrees, it could be more difficult. 

When it comes to the food, you know what to expect.  It's the same things they've been serving all these years.  They might add a special here and there but that;s about it.  You have the rosti, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, and desserts.  At the very least, mostly everything will be prepared fresh to order.  

Service is hit or miss depending on how busy it is.  I've never had a terrible experience at Richtree.  But like I said, I've never been blown away either."}
{"text":"ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK! Arrived at Richtree restaurant in Square One to find it closed!!! HORROR! Richtree is the only place within the mall where we can eat healthy (same goes for Toronto Eaton Centre).  BUT not to worry... they are re-opening at the other end of the mall, in the new expansion, on November 15! Can't wait! Apparently with new menu... got to go check it out... in the meantime i guess I'll bring snacks sigh..."}
{"text":"Over the years, we've often come here for brunch or desserts, but it seems that the quality of the food keeps going down the drain.  

The rosti used to be my favourite.  The pizzas here are decent but I can't say too much about the rest of the menu.  The only reason I came back recently was for the 2-for-1 crepe special.  Even then, I found it disappointing; the chocolate sauce might as well have been squeezed out of a bottle and the strawberries I ate were tart.

Don't expect the waiters or the busboys here to acknowledge your existence.  Tthe crowds here make the place feel stuffy and the atmosphere here just feels stiff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend, he works in the mall, so he was able to tell me what's good and what's not.

He recommended either pizza, rosti, or mussels..

I went with the sausage rosti with sour cream. Potatoes were cut on the spot so it tasted pretty good! Sausage was pre-cooked and has been sitting for a while.. nothing special at all..

Buddy got 1 pound of mussels, the cream sauce was excellent and the fresh mussels always taste better the frozen.

Didn't get a chance to try their made to order wood oven pizza.. but I would imagine it's pretty good.

Bill came up to $25 including the built in tax and tip - we did a get a 10% discount cuz buddy worked in the mall.

Would come back to try their rotisserie chicken if it was the right time of day and would also want to try their pizza.."}
{"text":"Brunching with my father and brother in law to be who are both not so adventurous eaters, my fiancé recommended Richtree. it is very much like a fancy food court where you are given a card to scan when entering. When you place your order, the service person at the perspective counter swipe your card and you are to pay when leaving the restaurant. 

It was my first time dining in this chain and was excited to see what it has to offer especially after receiving my maid of honor's raving recommendation of smoked salmon with potato cake (which I wasn't able to find). I ended up running lapses between stations before deciding on roasted chicken crepe. My fiancé and father in law decided to try their steak and the brother went with the pasta of the day. My roasted chicken crepe was lacking flavor. The only seasoning they put was salt and pepper on the chicken. . I smothered my crepe with sweet radish from the burger section and Tabasco  for some kick. For the taste and how it was made, definitely not worth 13 dollars. 

My fiancé, his brother and father in law all enjoyed their dishes. Steaks were well cooked and pasta had a nice flavor. However again for the price - over 80 bucks for 4 just ok entrees? I think I prefer more dim sum in Toronto instead."}
{"text":"I already paid for the ramen when i read the reviews (too late...)

I agree that you see the big word RAMEN and the pictures seems good. It's 24.84$ tx in for 2 ppl.

The broth is tasteless. The spicy tori tattan is not spicy at all. Thank Sriracha for its existence, it saved a bit the flavour of the noodle.

They pan stir the meet first.. it was chewy..
Egg was tasty and pre-cooked but im okay with it.
Ramen was okay.
Chinese brocoli .. haha!

Well, I will not come back, but I had worst asian food experience. I agree that my less than 1$ instant noodles is probably tastier. I would give it 1.5.."}
{"text":"I still like the atmosphere, but I think the quality of the food has declined. It doesn't seem worth the high prices anymore."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. The bill came up to $17. Probably the worst lunch I've had in a while. The bacon wasn't cooked properly and the pretzel bun was soggy. I paid $4 for the fries and it didn't even cover the bottom of the box. I will never go back there again. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"SADLY, they CLOSED down!!!  Strange given how good they were and how busy!!

Come once per month with two friends. Food is ALWAYS very good - pasta dishes, salads, sandwiches...have never been disappointed. The dessert and coffee are fabulous!  price is so good for what y ou get.  Atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming."}
{"text":"I usually like Richtree. Love the ones downtown. This one was a little lacking. The Sushi was great but they didn't barely give any soy sauce with it and the rest of the food was lacking. Not bad, just not great. 

They seemed friendly and relaxed but that doesn't make up for the lack of tongue enjoyment."}
{"text":"First time in the store. Place looks very clean and organised. Wandered around looking for some breakfast. There were many different  sections of the store offering everything from fresh oven baked pizza, stir fry, gourmet sandwiches grill etc. I decide to try the breakfast rosti combo with bacon. It came with 2 eggs cooked to order. Rosti is basically hash brown. The man making the food name is Prianyk for short was not very friendly nor helpful. I should not be made to feel like he is doing a great service. He should have stayed at home. I mentioned this to the cashier who just kind of shrugged. It has put me ti a bad start of my day. First impression is a lasting one. There are equally nice food to buy at SQ 1 that would have nicer staff."}
{"text":"Proof that my eyes are often bigger than my stomach, Richtree seduces me with the promise of abundant food prepped by staff in natty neckerchiefs. It all looks great, even if the actual dining experience lengs itself to lowered expectations. 

Located in the basement of College Park, tucked away from the main food court, this Richrtree has an exotic, almost hidden vibe...until you realize it lies under 17 stories of civil servants, lawyers and the occasional CBC radio host awaiting a bail hearing. the space itself feels a bit shabby and worn. The staff are...there, ready to spoon your requested itsems on to your plate with cafeteria-lady enthusiasm, and punch your ticket so you can pay. 

it's a bit underwhelming, and I sometimes need to remind myself that Richtree is the result of a bitter corporate divorce that resulted in original parent company Movenpick leaving the country for a while to cool off...(I think they're back now, further downtown). The Richtree concept retains some of the original's charm...coffee is stil made fresh by the cup, in a machine that looks like Optimus Prime and your Keurig got it on to Big Ears Teddy's chagrin. I can still get my oversize hashbrown on at the Rosti station, and the muffins are still delightful greasebombs in flavours Tim Horton ignores.

 But the ice cream isn't made in house (Movenpick's Sundaes were a sght to behold), and the plates are sometimes skimpy and I feel like a pest rather than a guest.  

Classier than the food court next door; well suited to the demands of the takeout crowd, and the Rosti is in fact as good as ever; darkly crisp on the outside and fluffy inside, well-paired with schnitzel or sausage (assuming you get there before they run out). 

Truth be told, it's more of a 2 star than a 3 star place...but it's close, and I don't have to go outside to get a good hot lunch. 

Works for me."}
{"text":"Great place for desserts, especially their fresh made crepes where they make it in front of you. Great place for students where each person is responsible for their own bill by having their own card. A nicer alternative than good court."}
{"text":"I just went back this past weekend and would update the grade to at least 3.5.
The atmosphere is great for a neighborhood that has little else going on in the close vicinity. The \"garden\" seating area with the high ceiling is particularly pleasant.
 I noticed at least two factors that give this place an additional boost:
1)There were two ladies chatting/gossiping in the seat next to us when we got there with only two teas. They sat comfortably without being hassled during the two hours we were there. Having moved to NYC, I somehow find this very very appealing!
2)There is free wifi.
So basically it is an awesome spot to chill with friend or your laptop/book, knowing you have tons of great choices in everything from salads to desserts.

Regarding the food: The juice bar is recommended. Bruschetta was great as always. The Smoked Salmon that came with my Rosti, was better than the Rosti itself. As for dessert, the Crepe a la strawberries & bananas with Choc sauce was delectable, if a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for breakfast.

Richtree is quick and doesn't have a ridiculously long coffee line like the one the forms daily at nearby Tim Horton's.

Although the regular food here is not as good as March's (the better market-style restaurant in T-dot), their Cafe au Lait and Whole Wheat Bagel are good.  That's pretty much my regular daily morning bread & butter.

I've tried the Rosti here and it was just okay.  The oven baked chicken was decent.  The sandwiches are alright.  Again, if you want better market-style food and don't mind a leisurely meal, I recommend Marche, which is right next to the Hockey Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"Hmm, not sure why everyone's complaining about this place. The food is made right in front of your eyes and you know exactly what's in your plate. Yes, the price is high, and yes they have a lousy fountain where you can fill your glass with water, but they make good crepes and their latte is also very good. I am fan of their decor and secretly wish I could swing on the swing like a kid when nobody's watching."}
{"text":"I love going to Richtree for breakfast. The smell of bakery items fresh from the oven, fresh ground coffee beans, fried eggs... mmmmm....They used to have a coffee and muffin special before 11:00am, but I think they got rid of that. A freshly baked crunchy-on-the-outside, moist-on-the-inside muffin (the mango coconut is my favourite) and a medium coffee is around $3. There's seating nearby and plenty of highchairs, perfect for moms like me who like to go out with the little one :) For lunch, I like their rosti (pan fried shredded potatoes) served with their ever-changing accompaniments - I had the curry chicken once and it was delish! Sometimes they have smoked salmon or sausage, it changes every day. If you want, you can have the rosti on its own, served with sour cream. If you're at Square One and are looking for some place to eat, don't limit yourself to the selection in the food court, head on over to Richtree! Maybe I'll see you there ;)"}
{"text":"I lived in College Park for over a year, and this Richtree was on my way out of the building, so I've consumed my fair share of muffins.  If you're there early, fresh-baked muffins are a treat! Their coffee is not bad but the staff there don't always know how to make all of their cafe menu offerings properly.  I recall a few very unholy americanos. . .

There is a variety of grab-and-go items like fresh-squeezed juice and yogurt parfaits which are fine. Their other items (rosti, crepes) are solid but expensive.  The ambience is basically \"mall food court with cheesy German music playing\"--the outdoor courtyard tables would be awesome to sit at in the summer if it weren't for the pigeon mafia swarming all about.  

Richtree also has some nice half-price deals after 5, so if you work or live nearby and have no interest in cooking dinner, it's a cheap way to enjoy salad residual sandwiches and salad bar choices.

Richtree is adjacent to a veritable hive of grease and villainy in food court form, so it's really your most conscionable choice if you're setting on eating in the building."}
{"text":"I can't contain myself... this restaurant gets my first official \"Are you f***ing kidding me?\" 1-star rating.  I want to waste my time writing or your time reading this review so I will leave you with three points:

- Double americano and a bowl of the purple gook (muesli) - $9.18.  Including the \"service\" charge - the \"service\" not including carting my full to the brim coffee 3/4's of the way through the restaurant.

- The only possible reason to go there is to get the coffee and muffin for $1.98 deal, sit at the best seat (whichever that is) for hours on end, drinking the free serve yourself water (with a new cup each time), and choke the free wi-fi torrenting movies... (yet to try all this but its on my list).

- I was here at 7:30 am or so... its empty... looking for a newspaper, guess they don't have any, so I sit down to \"enjoy\" my food.  I noticed a reserved sign on maybe 8 of the tables... AND underneath that sign on a couple of the tables are fresh copies of the newspaper????  So I see an older well dressed woman come in with a coffee, make herself a piece of toast, and go and read the paper at the table.  What is this? Very very very poor man's Rosedale Golf Club???

GAH!!!!"}
{"text":"My review is for the \"Street Eats\" Restaurant. I came in here today looking for a good place to eat. I saw a burrito and I thought why not, It looked really good and fresh so I obtained said burritto. What I didn't want was attitude with my order and a skimping of the beef. The lady picked up a tong full of beef and 3 times, she took out the beef. There was literally less than a palm-full of shredded beef. When she wrapped it, she just wrapped it so messily and almost didn't care. I then paid for it and all I had was a $50 note. I honestly didn't see the tiny little paper label that said \"We don't accept $50 and $100 bills. When I received my change, the cashier whom I believe is the owner of the restaurant gave me attitude as well and told me \"next time we won't accept $50 bills and pointed to the sign. I said \"Oh crap, sorry didn't realize. she just looked at me and turned away then turned back to the next customer. When I got my burrito, although the ingredients were fresh, the burrito was BLAND. It was like there was no flavour at all. I had to go get hot sauce from \"The Pink Bowl\" which gave it some flavour. That was a good hot sauce btw. It had a good spice. But how does a burrito place not have hot sauce, dumbfounded I tell you. 

And $11.54 for a burrito without a drink that tasted like feet, come on.

I then saw a dude's pizza and wished I got that instead. 

I probably will never come back to this place again.  The establishment really needs to change their attitude though as it seemed they were cold to every customer, not cheerful. And don't bring up that it's the lunch hour rush because it wasn't that bad. In addition, change your ingredients or add some flavour. 
The chinese lady who took the first part of my order had a better pleasantry to her than anyone else in that place. 

Also, the guacamole was just plain avocado and the house guacamole is $1.50. If it's a matter of adding garlic to the house version, and charging and extra $1.50, seriously that's the dumbest business sense I've ever heard of. Why not make 1 generic house guac and charge $0.50 to $0.75 for it.

I give this place a 1 star because of the burrito flavour and the attitude."}
{"text":"Horrible patio etiquette by sales staff. I bought a salmon sandwich which was great, but nearly got kicked off the patio, because my 70 year old mother was eating a Timmies soup. Never had an experience like this. And the manager's attitude basic attitude was \"too bad so sad\" . Good job Richtree!"}
{"text":"In need of a restaurant idea in the area, I suggested my friend to hold his gf's surprise party here.

I love the RichTree downtown and I've been here once before so I knew it'd be the ideal place for multiple guests.

As you walk in, you are given a blank shopping card and there are several food stations around the restaurant. There's a station for salads, oven pizzas, crêpes, pasta and etc for all types of foodies to enjoy. As you are purchasing a meal, the staff will load the cost on your card which you pay for on your way out.

As I came here tonight, I was really excited however was quickly disappointed as I was eating my meal. My food wasn't as flavorful as I last remembered. My cheese broccoli soup was pretty bland but thank goodness my delicious pepperoni thin crust pizza saved the day. 

What I do like about this place is the decor, the friendly and efficient service and the variety of food. Perhaps next time I'll only visit the downtown location to avoid any food mishaps."}
{"text":"I loved the decor of the place. The meatballs were good but kind of cold. My dish was okay but my boyfriends lasagna was very flavourful. There are lots of options to choose from. Nice spot to go in grab whatever your taste buds want, eat and head out!"}
{"text":"Can i just say YUM! The meat crepe was just delicious with the roasted pepper sauce. I also had the mango smoothie which was just right (kinda wish it was colder) but overall good meal. My boyfriends roasties were cooked well too. Love coming here. Such a cool and easy vibe."}
{"text":"Ok you all have to agree here that their muffins ROCK! The croissants are SCRUMPTIOUS.. Oh dear.. I just wish they had a non-mall location since I deeply dislike sq1:p But for those fresh, warm croissants I am willing to accept the location. Everything is freshly baked on the spot and as another Yelper said, it is just much more decent than plastic cutlery and Styrofoam plates in the overcrowded food court. Overpriced? Maybe.  But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I went for a quick breakfast here with a friend. It's set up like a market with different stations.  So many selections. You choose your food and they ask for your card. I had a good vegetarian omelette and cafe latte. It's pretty quiet and you'll enjoy a good conversation while having breakfast. At the end, you hand your card to pay.  I'll try lunch or dinner here next time."}
{"text":"We are regular Marche customers down town, so last night we took some out of town guests to this location merely because of proximity. Both me and my daughter ordered the mussels I got mine in the tomato sauce whilst hers was in a white sauce. We are both suffering from terrible food poisoning this morning. Quality control is definitely questionable and I don't think I will be going to this particular location again. I would recommend staying away!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of Richtree.  You get a card, and then you go around to the different stations and they give you your meal and you slide your card, then at the end, you go to a register and pay for it.  Simple, right?

Well, it gets a little more complicated than that.  The prices are a little more than what I would like, even though my mocha cappuccino was ginormous, it was still almost $5.00.  The small fruit plate was almost $3.00! I wanted to try the salmon omelette, but that was almost $10.00 so I settled for a veggie omelette.  I could tell that some of the people manning the stations were new, since there was a lot of confusion going on.

On the plus side, they do have a lot of offerings, and everything is pretty fresh.  There's fresh pasta (made right in front of you) meats, home made pizzas, fruit, desserts, waffles, crepes, everything.  The service is minimal, and when Joe and I paid we noticed that we didn't have to include a tip.  We though, hey, that's cool, until I noticed there was a service charge.  ::Grumble:: I mean, all they did was clear our plates.  But I think it was only like a 10% tip or something like that.  

Also, this particular location is GIGANTIC, I went to find the bathrooms, and the restaurant just seemed to keep going and going.  I don't think I would be in a hurry to come back here honestly, but I think it's a great place for families that have picky children.  There's even a clown that comes and visits."}
