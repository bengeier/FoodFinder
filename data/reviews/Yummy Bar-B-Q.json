{"text":"The owner is racist and rude as hell. Good luck you guys having food when the owner is in good mood."}
{"text":"Forget fast-food hamburgers. No adjoined Taco Bell/KFC for me! Just give me YUMMY! 

The food appears to be fresh (unless of course they have the biggest imaginable vat of spicy stew or bbq meat back in the kitchen) and is great value. My favourite part about Korean food is the banchan. Several different pickled beauties, on separate plates... all for me! Daikon, sprouts, kimchi, tofu. 

I'm not sure if the man who runs this Yummy knows a lot of English, but when we ask for our food to be \"Korean Spicy\", he flashes this impish grin and does his darndest (or what I would like to believe to be).

Don't expect to be brought your food, drink, bill... nada. Yummy Bar-B-Q is pretty much completely self-serve. Personally, I like to see where my beverages are coming from and to fill my own cup, so it's not a problem for me. They call out your order when it's ready and you pick it up at the counter. No nonsense! 

Portions are awesome, and you get about a tonne of rice to go with your meal (especially the BBQ lunch specials)."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm wary of everything in this dingy mall, but my friend works around the corner and insisted this place was good.  And oh my god, it seriously was.  I love that the banchan came with a giant hunk of marinated tofu--I can't get enough of the stuff.  The portions were large and the food was very tasty, but I've got to dock points because we ordered just as the place was closing and so had to take our dinner to go and eat standing over a garbage can in the mall.

That part sucked."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years.  Its inexpensive, good sized portions, very tasty, and good fast service.  

The restaurant itself has changed owners in the last few years, but there hasn't been any drop in quality or service.  The soups are wonderful on a freezing winters day.  Really hearty and filling.  The bbq is always delicious, and can be made as spicy or not as you like.  The tofu stew is really good and filling.  If you like squid or seafood etc. they have this as well, and various vegetarian fare.

The menu is somewhat small but obviously it keeps the prices down and the food fresh.  Its a good spot to stop and eat when you want something fast, filling, very tasty, and nutritious."}
{"text":"If you want the best Korean BBQ in Toronto you need to come here. It's definitely not the ritz, but I come here for the food, it's amazing. Pretty reasonably priced and the staff are great. It's family run and has been around for at least 20 years! I make sure I come here every time I'm in TO. I live in Edmonton and can't find anything like it there, so I've been craving it for 6 months! Nothing like jones-ing for something you have to travel 3500 kms for! Lol Bottom line, you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Happen to live upstairs...but that is for a future review.
Went here with a friend when we were hungry despite it's sketchy Chester-fried Chicken neighbour.
We got a cheap lunch special (11-4pm) and were pleasantly surprised! It's not like your downtown Korean food over a pit or anything, but it tasted super fresh and the guy was friendly. For 4.50 can't complain. Will go again.

If you have a friend upstairs get take out, or walk to high park, because the seating area is a little dingy and I dislike the Crossways mall for a few reasons.

Anyway, good food!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I've been served SOOOOO RUDE that I still don't believe what happened to me. Never ever try to complain or speak out to the servers or store owner that you are waiting 40 minutes for your food or your food is not well cooked. What you will get is being yelled at or simply telling you to GET OUT or asking you to pay for what is supposed to be free. My friends complained about waiting for their take-outs for almost an hour, they end up being BEATEN by the owner's son!!!!!
I'll never come back and tell me every single one of my friends to not come to this place, ever."}
{"text":"This location of Yummy Bar B Q is the most reliable and has the freshest food and the nicest service of any of the locations I've tried. It is in the Crossways plaza, which is a little mall underneath a big apartment complex. You can sit within a chained off area in the hallway of this mall. As with the other Yummy locations there is free barley tea and water available. The meals are very cheap and come with kimchi, a piece of tofu and some pickled daikon radish. If you are looking for good cheap korean food and find yourself at Dundas W and Bloor, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food here is alright. It's certainly Yummy. We had a bibimbap, beef dumpling soup, and spicy rice cake. I think I eat Korean food so often that it has become hard to impress me. Bibimbap is almost universally good. Song Cook has my vote on best bibimbap because they have 7 vegetable types and use very fresh ingredients. Yummy's had 5-6 different vegetables and a nice egg on top. Good enough for me. The beef dumpling soup is delicious and very good portion. Taste is light enough to my liking and doesn't taste like msg. My only complaint is with the rice cake. I thought they added too little fish cake and noodles but it's not a big deal to me. Taste is just like any other generic restaurant's rice cake (it tastes good).

The atmosphere is your typical mom & pop feeling you find in Korean restaurants. I generally don't care about atmosphere so I'm being neutral here. I like to pay for good food, not the atmosphere. 

Overall, the food doesn't really stand out. It's highly edible. While there's nothing special about the food, I recommend this place if you're looking for great value. Some items are as low as $6.50 and their prices INCLUDE tax. So it's a bargain considering the portions and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Due to the more unique Annex location than the Korean Grill House/Made in China empire I was hoping this would beat those in quality and execution.  Sadly it didn't live up to the chain location's standard which should've been easier to beat.  

They were super stingy on Kalbi Korean short ribs, even though listed on the all you can eat it didn't even show until requested and the first time was a stingy amount of weak cuts.  Good thing I just keep requesting them.

Similar to other Korean BBQs the seafood quality is super low."}
{"text":"For the love of God, is all that for me?

One of the drawbacks to being a decent cook is that when I go out, there's often a little part of my brain that's analyzing what it is that I've given my hard-earned cash for to eat.   When a resto cuts too many corners or does it too brazenly (say, by mixing milk with the already-cheeseless bleu cheese side to buffalo wings... God...), sometimes it'll make or break whether or not I go there again.  Because, you know, when you love to cook, you notice that kind of thing.  

But then there are those places that completely surprise you, places where you can't help but smile when you compare both expense and expectation with what it is you've received on your plate.  Such was my eye-opening, palate-happy experience with Yummy Bar-B-Q.

It isn't a feast for the eyes, and the truth is that the slightly beaten-down look of the place kept me away for a while before I finally crossed the threshold.  The sloppy, hand-scrawled signage along the walls and the intimidating enclave that hides the kitchen from the dining area definitely kills any sense of ambience making this a date-worthy joint... but the food.... whoah.

I was grabbing a fast lunch during my workday, and was stunned to get a fabulously spicy mountain (mountain, I tell you) of chicken, stirfried veggies, and nutty Korean rice for about five bucks.  Yeah, you read that right.  And for another buck or two, I could have added tofu and traditional kimchee to my plate, even though what I already was looking at was enough to feed two.  

Similar lunch specials are available with beef, pork, squid, shrimp, or simply vegetarian.  Dinner entrees feature a variety of barbecued dishes (all of the above meats plus charcoaled mackerel), plus the noodle, rice, stirfry and other dishes that might expect from an Asian resto.  No entree is priced above twelve bucks, making this ugly but delicious spot a choice locale for the budget-conscious, spice-loving foodie.  

And they serve beer.  Ooo."}
{"text":"Fair priced, fast service, and good food.  

Yummy Bar-B-Q's only drawback is it's setting. 
The option to dine in is there though it feels very much like eating in a food court. 

Last night was my first visit. 
I ordered their BBQ (pick 2) They had a wide selection to choose from.
I opted for beef (spicy) and salmon. Everything was very good, it was served with rice, bean sprouts, kimchi, bean curd, and macaroni salad. I was surprised with how good the macaroni salad was.

I will certainly returen"}
{"text":"This place I would say is on the low end in terms of quality Korean food in the area.  Its not too say they are that bad, just that there are better options for Korean nearby (just head West a few more blocks and you start seeing them).  There are a lot of dishes to choose from and the prices are cheap, and the food is decently good and filling.  

I also like the self serve tea and water stations, I tend to drink a lot of liquids and sometimes feel guilty for asking for more tea at places so having a self serve station suits me.  I'd love to see that at more places!"}
