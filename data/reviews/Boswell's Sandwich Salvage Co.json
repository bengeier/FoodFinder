{"text":"I've tried numerous items on the menu and every single one is delicious and made with fresh ingredients.  I love the interesting options on the menu, there aren't many place around here with such good vegetarian options.  If you want something different, like a fresh sandwich or quiche, this place can't be beat.  My only issue is the price, but you really feel like you get what you pay for, so I'm willing to pay a little extra."}
{"text":"I'm so sad this restaurant closed! It became our new favorite go-to for dinner when nobody felt like cooking. They had the best reuben sandwich I've ever had, ever! They also had delicious goat cheese and sun dried tomato quiche. I mean amazing, not just good! Come back Boswell's...come back!!!!"}
{"text":"O.k., o.k. We had to stop in and try this place just to see what all the hype was about and if any of it was true. Can you say OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is the real deal and I can't say that I, nor my taste buds, have ever had a sandwich as good as these are. Yes, we have been back and it is just as good and we will be back again and again as long as our stomachs don't explode from the massive amount of food you get on the plates they serve you. Hot dog they call them here but they are the largest hot dogs I have ever seen and cooked to a plump juicy temp with an awesome bun. The burger is a 1/2 pound which we ordered well done and yet it came out so juicy and full of flavor. The cook has his stuff together here. I might just have to forgo the diet and head back over there tonight.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Everything that I have ever eaten at Boswell's was FANTASTIC.  Very tasty.  I was very disappointed to hear that they will be closing tomorrow :-(  I wish that their was something that I can do to keep this restaurant around as they have an awesome product!  We have to support our local businesses so that they stay around.  Swing by Boswell's and let them know what you think of their sandwiches and maybe just maybe we may be able to convince them to stick around :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Boswell's a few times now, and each time I've really enjoyed what I've ordered.  The space Boswell's is in has gone through a few different incarnations over the years, and Boswell's is the best establishment by far.  They have a variety of sandwiches and burgers, as well as salads and soup.  It's not often that I crave a sandwich, but the Grindhouse is definitely craveable!  Though not a vegetarian myself, I'm intrigued by the vegetarian options on the menu - there really is something for everyone.  I'd love to try dessert, but I've never been able too - I've always been too full after finishing my meal!  The only reason Boswell's gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  Sandwich prices are $9-ish, which means we'll probably only visit for dinner...there's no lunch menu that I'm aware of.  In any case, you do get what you pay for - these sandwiches are worth the price!  We'll definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"On the quest to discover a new restaurant,  we wandered into Boswell's.  The exterior is completely unassuming but once inside, it's hard not to like the decor.  It's a cafe with comfortable seating, metal and brick walls and a bar with beer and wine.  The menu is a mix of sandwiches,  salads, burgers and hot dogs.  I had the meatball and the roast beef.  The meatball was huge and requires a fork and knife to eat.  It's very filling.  The roast beef was amazing: cheese, rare and just good.  Fries were great too.  The staff was amazing, giving us fruit and crackers for my son.   Definitely a place we will be returning to"}
