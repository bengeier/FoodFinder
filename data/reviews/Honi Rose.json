{"text":"We eat in this Persian restaurant each time we visit Montreal. The food is fresh and the service is excellent. The restaurant is off the main shopping road. Very reasonably priced. The only problem is that in this short street where this restaurant is located there are three Xrated massage stores. A little eye sore...but since it is off the main road you have nothing to worry about. I think in Canada the Xrated places are legal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant closed...it served amazing Persian food...hope it reopens!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch. Our meals came with tasty lentil soup and my friend had an entree that had rice with saffron and cranberries and chicken. She liked the chicken but wasn't too crazy about the rice. I got a dish that came with rice and Lima beans and lamb shank. The lamb was great and the rice was flavorful, but I wish it had more Lima bean. The waitress was kind but not very knowledgeable, perhaps because she was new. I will give them four stars though because they do know how to make good food."}
{"text":"Tips:
1- The eggplant appetizers are superb. Try them with the freshly baked bread.
2- The Kabab selection is great and authentic.
3- They put some pita bread, butter and onions on the table before they serve the food. You're not supposed to eat that onion with the pita bread! The butter is to mixed with rice, Pita bread is for the appetizers, and the onions to be eaten with the Kabab"}
{"text":"C'est sur le conseil d'un ami que nous nous sommes retrouvés dans cet établissement de restauration iranienne.

La décoration n'a rien d'exceptionnel. Le service est correct. Pour les amateurs de riz, je vous conseille de tester le riz iranien. Sa légèreté et son goût en étonnera plus d'un!

Manque de chance, le jour où nous avons mangé le système de paiement par carte bancaire était en panne. Cash only donc..."}
{"text":"Came here while I visited Montreal. It was a very great restaurant. Pita and salad with sauce was good. A variety of kabobs, and rice came to the table and it was pretty good. Compared to some Persian restaurants in Toronto, this is pretty good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good and authentic Persian food. I find the rice to be a bit heavy and easily filling but the meats especially the koubiddeh are all very good."}
{"text":"By far the best tasting Koobideh i've ever had. I'm not Persian but i'm obssesed with Persian food so i eat it a lot. Their soups and eggplant are badass too. 

They're a star short for the lack of alcohol. I know it's a religion thing but it takes away from the experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal and decided to try a new Persian restaurant.  We've had Persian food before both in Montreal and in our home state of NJ.  However, we don't find many Persian restaurants in NJ so it continues to be a craving.

This place is clean and comfortable.  The service and food are both great.  We were hoping to enjoy a drink but found out it was BYOB.  After spending a little time in this family owned restaurant, we no longer had the urge for a glass of wine.  Instead, friendly conversation with the staff was enjoyable.  It was quiet the night we visited.

I would recommend this restaurant and would visit again the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Persian food so I had no idea what to expect.  The service was really good especially considering we were a large group.  The food itself was also another high note of this place.  To start I had a lentil soup which was pretty good.  I also tried the gheymeh which is a veal shank stew.  It was loaded with lentils and seasoned with saffron and overall really good.   The meat was very tender.  

As the other poster points out they don't serve alcohol here which is a bit of  a downer but I do understand that the owners do it for religious reasons.  Apart from that though this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks it has been close for weeks. Unfortunately IT IS OUT OF BUSSINESS"}
