{"text":"Tried their Groupon deal. Poke was good, staff Matt was super helpful and friendly. Tried his recommendations Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Discovered this new, nearby location of Soulfish Poke thanks to a \"New Hot Restaurant\" push from Yelp. And they're right! Fresh, delicious and generous servings of everything included in the 12 oz bowls we built. Yes, it's a bit pricier than another new poke spot we tried recently, but I don't mind paying a little extra for awesome sized servings. These were MEALS. I had the lighter mixed greens as a base and my husband had rice, and he brought home leftovers. Friendly staff and a clean, \"Green\" atmosphere... perfect! Looking forward to indulging our fish cravings here often."}
{"text":"Fun new spot to try! The worker who assisted us was very helpful and friendly. Will definitely be coming back. The ahi tuna was really delicious and you can mix and match as many toppings as you like. Cool new way to build a poke bowl!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Great and friendly staff. Anyone stopping by should defiantly get the Passion Bowl, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Yet another amazing poke bowl at Soulfish Poke! This place just does it right.  The ingredients couldn't be fresher, every bowl is utterly delicious, and I'm not mad at the fact that it's also healthy for me ;)  I would say that I'll definitely be back, but I've already gone back! But...I'll definitely be back anyway.   Keep making me those delicious poke bowls, Soulfish!"}
{"text":"When  we walked in, no one was there. After a minute of saying 'hello' the worker came out talking. I thought he was talking to me, it turns out he was to talking to someone on his phone, so we had to wait for him to finish. Service sucked and poke sucks. The rice was cold, i wasnt expecting that. Not worth my money. I will never come back even if its closest poke place from where i live."}
{"text":"After a long day at work, I was craving for some seafood/sushi and I immediately thought about giving Soulfish a try because it's literally 2 mins away from home. I ordered the Passion bowl, substituting the tuna for some salmon on a bed of COLD, HARD, INEDIBLE brown rice. I enjoyed the fish, but hardly anything else. The seaweed salad was just okay and so were the sauces. My bowl was definitely missing something, don't know what it was, but I wasn't blown away. I would rather drive down to To See Roll or Jaburritos for my \"sushi\" fix. Sometimes the best things in life aren't always convenient."}
{"text":"Horrible! the \"ceviche\" was raw grey flavorless shrimp and the spicy tuna had a questionable texture like it had been cooked part way. It wasn't seasoned properly so it wasn't spicy or salty AT ALL.  Brown rice was too hard--and I eat brown rice all the time. It should be firm and nutty. Not difficult to chew. Very dissappointing overall. Took two bites and the rest went in the garbage."}
{"text":"Taste and quality-wise I personally prefer Soho not far away, but the customer service here is definitely better. They weren't stingy with fish/protein portions, although my fish had lots of cartilage or whatever the white stuff is is that makes fish chewy in some parts and hard to eat. The ingredients seem fresh and they let you add toppings without making you feel like you're inconveniencing them. So, summary of my experience is good customer service but just okay in taste. Maybe I'll try something different next time."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and I mean SUPER friendly. It instantly cheered up my day coming in here. The management did a fantastic job in hiring and training their staff. 5 stars to the staff.  The food is tasty and was fresh enough. I love the concept of healthy and sustainable eating. The restaurant is quick service, but is decorated well and inviting. We came in with a groupon and my only complaint would be the cost. Wihtout the groupon, it would have been rather expensive for a quick service spot. I get it though because they use expensive ingredients.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine invited me to this new joint as she wanted to eat healthy, but I wanted something tasty & filling. Well, it checked all three boxes as it was soooo damn good. There were loads of choices for ingredients. Anyone can find a cool mix that will suit your tastebuds.  The service was fast, yet they took the time to explain all the additions b/c I didn't know anything abt poke. Their suggestions compliment the fish and helped me build an awesome bowl.  I ate there, but it's also on my weekly drive by list to take home b/c it's so quick & healthy.  I'm done w/ Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is still in business.  Now a chain of poke places trying to cash in on the poke craze but without knowing what they are doing.  Walked in at 5pm to be greeted by nobody.  I don't mean that nobody said hello there was absolutely no one in the store.  I waited a couple minutes and left.  I'd stay away at all cost. Right around the corner is fish and bowl and real mom and pop place with sashimi and poke bowl specials."}
{"text":"Not a lot of selections and rice were undercooked, kinda grainy, crew was very nice though... And great location."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious. The devise is great. The place it's self is pretty and organic looking."}
{"text":"There are many other better poke places around that gives larger portions with more selection. I liked that their fish was covered and stored cold. It seems more sanitary to me than other places where the fish is uncovered. It was slow on a Friday night and one person was working. Decor was nice and I liked the one in henderson but that was back when there weren't many poke restaurants around."}
{"text":"When ever you get invited to a pre-opening you kind of expect them to not really be ready for actual customers.  Not at SoulFish.  I'd literally eat here for lunch and dinner as often as possible.  I'm dedicating a portion of my life to eating healthy and just taking better care of my body over all and it is so challenging to find healthy food that is delicious. Not anymore!  Love SoulFish!"}
{"text":"Love poké of all kinds. For the price the portions are small, protein choices are limited and the ceviche tasted weird, like sour and fizzy..? They ran out of greens and the scoops are tiny. This place is not in my top 10."}
{"text":"Shocked to see all the good reviews.  They were completely empty Friday at dinner time which should have warned us.   Out of shrimp ceviche, out of tuna.  The salmon was cut soooooo thick I could barely chew it.  No gluten free dressing options made for a super sad bowl.  Really pricey for what you get.   Be aware, the crab is imitation crab! No tap water available.  Overall really disappointed."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and overall, I am pleased. I walked in and there was no one there, but the gentleman immediately popped out of the back. I told him this was my first time and he thoroughly explained to me about building your own bowl. I ordered a large with white rice and spicy tuna and ahi tuna with kimchi, onions, furikake and nori to top it off. Overall, it was very good! The kimchi was a little sour for my taste so next time I'll leave the kimchi out. It's a nice restaurant with a pleasing Hawaiian vibe. Will I be back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Went to the Durango and Warm Springs location. The parking lot could be iffy at times but it's worth a little inconvenience. The poke bows are very fresh. Their preconceived bowls are great but you can also create completely from scratch. I love The Passion Bowl!  Staff is more than happy to tweak your order to suit your preference. My only complaint would be the limited availability of the Raspberry Miso sauce (I'd heard it was amazing but although it is still on the menu it has unfortunately been removed)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a good place to have lunch and after reading mostly good reviews, we decided to give this place a try. There was one review I noticed stating that they had found a hair in their food which I chose to ignore and figured maybe it was a one time mistake that wouldn't happen again.  This place is extremely over priced for the small amount of fish that they give. $10 for one choice of fish that doesn't even fill up the entire scoop. Their sauce choices are very limited and while the menu says that they offer furikake, the worker said they do not have furikake and instead, added some black sesame seeds and 2 full sheets of nori. Receiving my food I was very disappointed but did not complain as it was my decision to give this place a try. My boyfriend opted out and we went to Jersey Mike's Subs for him. While I was eating my bowl there, I noticed a LONG strand of hair that was noticeably cooked with the rice. The worker had little to no hair so it could not of been his and had to have been from whoever made the rice. I immediately went back to to show the worker my contaminated food and he did not seem very surprised. He offered to make me another bowl and began grabbing a new bowl but considering the hair must have been cooked in the rice and this had happened to another customer before me, I was not going to chance it. I asked for a refund, left, and definitely will not be returning again."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my apartment and I noticed it a couple months ago and was like, hm, I love poke. I gotta come here sometime.  So I walk in around 1pm and I'm greeted by the worker right away. I tell him it's my first time and he immediately starts walking me through the steps of how to order (simple enough).   I ordered a build-your-own with a base of white rice, protein choices of ahi tuna, salmon, and crab, and topped it off with sriracha mayo, sesame seeds, and furikake. I hurried my hungry little self home so I could devour this food in peace.  Overall, quality of fish was good. I was very impressed with the salmon - fresh and tasted great. The imitation crab, however... tasted like it had been sitting in some vinegar-y type sauce, which made it taste different than regular imitation crab found at most sushi and/or poke joints. As for the ahi tuna, I'm kinda wishing I didn't get it. It was just meh to me. I enjoyed the salmon best. The sriracha mayo compliments it so well.   I don't recall what size I got, but my bowl (no extras/drinks/etc) cost about $16. A little pricey.   Will I be back? Possibly. But I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"We had purchased a groupon for this place and wanted to try it out. So last Saturday we went to the location on Rainbow. Before hand we looked online and on yelp to see what time they were open til. On Saturday night at 7 we arrived to the place only to find the place completely closed.  Mind you everywhere we looked and even on the door said that they were open til 9 pm. No sign no nothing explaining why they closed early. It wouldn't of been such a big deal if we lived by the area. But we live on the other side of town. So my husband called around and someone at the Warm Springs location answered and said that they would accept our groupon at their location. It's was more or less 5 mins away. When we got there the place looked closed. The lack of light led me to believe that.  However the open sign let me know that they were in fact open. There were no customers when we got there. There was one guy working there. He was really cool and talkative. He explained the menu to us and was helpful. I ordered the Buddha bowl and my husband the passion bowl. My bowls base was greens and my husband's traditional. Rice. The fish was good. The sauces were good too.  It wasn't bad tasting. But to us the portion sizes were just extremely disappointing. I found myself still so hungry afterwards. I figured since I ordered greens as my base I'd get more that just a handful of greens or if you can even call it that.  Honestly i have had better poke bowls else where. I really wanted to like this place. This location inside is beautiful. I love the decor. But sadly it didn't reach my expectations as far as poke bowls go. I definitely won't comeback.  I wouldn't recommend it to my family or friends either."}
{"text":"I tried to visit this location today because I had a Groupon but it appears to be closed.  No sign and phone goes to voicemail.  I've eaten at the Henderson location and loved it, I was excited to see a location open closer to Summerlin, but I'm not gonna haul my ass to Henderson for a poke bowl.  REFUND!"}
{"text":"Got invited for a soft opening kinda thing for lunch today and it was a great experience.  First of this is a nice clean designed and simple looking place, it feels welcoming, open and inviting walking in there.  The menu is simple and refreshing, and the food was the same, the bowls are put together from some standard options in a like built your own style and it works, i like every bit of it. The price point is there, not to cheap and not to expensive, good lunch value.  The staff was super friendly and overall i would definitely recommend giving this a try."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot!!  So fresh and delicious!!!!   The guy behind the counter was friendly and the food was healthy, and so yummy!!!   If you like sashimi with extras....this is your vibe.  Great ZEN decor as well."}
{"text":"Good poke, yummy options, just wish we would have gotten what was on the menu. Ordered a Sutra, and there were citrus segments instead of mango in our bowl.  Will definitely try it again tho."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The poke bowls are amazing. This is my new favorite go-to place. I have already been there twice since I discovered it. They have many different poke bowls you can buy  or you can create your own. They are all freshly made and  you can customize it anyway you want. The employees are all very nice. Check this place out! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Stopped in today with my work colleagues for a treat.  What a great concept and staff.  I would highly recommend having lunch here.  It's healthy and delicious!  Thanks Greg!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch at soulfish poke with buddies from work. Had the Buddha Bowl. Best lunch I've had in a long time. Fresh, healthy, flavorful!  High recommend you check this place"}
{"text":"Love the food, the gentleman behind the counter was extremely nice. Fresh ingredients and proteins. Good size portions, love the build your owns. Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The new manager Kimo turned this place around. Good quick service and food. Healthy too; I can stay on my diet without guilt. The place is really clean and is hidden in a corner, so it is a shame not many more frequent the place. I went in due to a 2 for 1 coupon and will keep coming back"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were great and both times I've been the only one in here.  Man December is such a slow time for all restaurants!  But it's nice to not feel hurried through a line especially when you don't know much about poké bowl building.  They are so nice here and explain it all.  They have some of their signature bowls you could order but I like to make my own with half rice half greens as a base.  Your not eating 100% poké so if you get all rice as a base, well rice is dry so expect that and get some extra sauce on the side.  You get to choose your sauce so if you get Orange citrus Yuzu and it's too sour then maybe next time get a different sauce!  I get a little siracha mayo and sesame wasabi and it's a good amount of sauce for me.  They fish is very fresh and high quality.  I love my little bowls of healthy deliciousness!  I get the 4oz scoop of protein and it's a lot and the cost is about $10 which is about the price of a sushi burrito and it's just as super good!  I think this place is way better and faster than the skinny fats in the same plaza.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty fish, great sauce options, and wonderful service!  Jalyn was very helpful for our first time there.  So many combinations to try.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This tasty gem has found itself a 3rd location in the Las Vegas valley. I love the first 2 and the 3rd is no exception. Same great feel as eastern and warm spring with a twist of the mural on the main wall.  All fresh ingredients and easy line ordering, makes for a different combination every time. Eating heather has never been so fun until I discovered the 1st location. Friendly staff takes time with each customer to customize the prefect individual bowl. Easier and faster than sushi perfect when flying solo for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Great selection of topping and proteins (Fish & Seafoods).  Very fresh!!  Great sauces!!   Jalyn was awesome with all the suggestions!!!"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon for 2 pokes and 2 drinks.  It was our first time having this and the server was very helpful in helping us put our meal together. We each created our bowls. I got salmon and the boyfriend got the spicy tuna. The server filled the protein to the top of scoop and was not shy of adding extra seaweed salad to it. Overall, the food was very filling and we left the place very happy. Will come again the next time we come to vegas."}
{"text":"Great quality and quantity for your money. Fresh fish and clean bowls for those of us that food conscious. Definitely a new favorite to Rhodes Ranch neighborhood"}
{"text":"As the owner promised, two more opened in SW area.  Yay points!  This one is located in the Rainbow Sunset Pavilion, diagonal from Bonchon; at the foot of the Hakkasan office building.  Why I like the woodwork in this location better... couldn't tell ya'.  But they preach of environment.  They're GREEN and this day and age we know how important that is for our earth :)  A large salad Artisan bowl has 8oz. protein.  Currently only ahi tuna and salmon are avilable; no albacore yet.  But don't get bummed out cuz these pieces are so chunky!  Still new so very clean.  Gloves are worn in food prep (great!)  Electronic pay is available with ability to mail your receipt (green environment).  Erwin helped me with my dinner tonight - service with a smile.  No reasons to shun ;)  Get your poke face on gagaaaas!"}
{"text":"With these poke bowl places popping up everywhere, i was really hoping this one was good since it was closest to me. Sadly it wasn't. First i went on a Sunday afternoon and the place looked dark inside like it was closed.  (open sign was not turned on.) i figured i walk by and have a look and then go to Robertos or something. i peeked inside and it was open. There was one guy ordering and one table occupied. I told the guy behind the counter how it looked like it was closed and he shrugged his shoulder and said no we are open like he didn't care and annoyed with me when i was trying to help him out! Of course he was not very nice taking my order either.   i customized my bowl and the rice was hard and cold. My sauce was too sweet. So overall i was very disappointed.  i will be driving further to else where."}
{"text":"Well with all this poke bowls so called popping all over town you think one would change how they do there version but dont sell a product and then you run out or ask me if i want a differe t kind of fish They have 3 locations already wow"}
{"text":"Just picked up 2 poke bowls and was disappointed. Although the tuna was fresh and 8oz gave you tons of protein, the white rice was hard as a rock. It tasted like it was refrigerated and not reheated. I also didn't like the fact that the protein was not placed behind the glass where you can see it rather behind a silver prep station so you couldn't see what you are getting until it's already in the bowl. I will not be going bac"}
{"text":"Fish was ok not the best. Toppings were a decent amount of choices and was fresh.  I order the Sutra but customized it anyway at no extra cost except for a couple items that were an up charge. Like avocado , smelt egg etc.  it is a straight forward ordering menu. Didn't have any side orders so I couldn't order anything for the baby no kids size either.  Use a groupon which came with drinks that's a great buy. Groupon is only for the 4oz but only a 2.50 extra charge for the 8oz. bowl.  The owner seem caring enough to walk around and see how we were doing and explain to us his concept. Which was nice."}
{"text":"Was excited to have an earlier night off and finally try this place. The door said they close at 9. I pulled in at 8:40 to see the lights were off and the door was locked. Maybe you should adjust the closing time. Not sure I'll be back here seeing as they're many other poke places in the area I thought about trying. The girl inside wiping the tables didn't even look up when I tried to open the door."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because I live in the area and received a buy one get one free coupon along with other coupons.   I order a poke bowl over rice, cucumber, avocado, seaweed salad (up sale was $1 more), tempura topping & ginger. I don't remember the sauce the gentleman made for me but he recommend it. My free bowl was the same thing, just over a salad instead of rice. Omg I was so excited on this buy one get one free coupon, I had lunch and dinner.   When I got home and ate the first bowl, it was soooooooo dry :( I was very disappointed. It has no flavor at all. I even tried to save it by dipping it over and over in soyu sauce but it was still gross. I maybe took 2 or 3 bits and couldn't do it. I tossed it in the trash along with free bowl #2. It was a wasted of money.     With there being so many poke bowl places popping up in Las Vegas, I wouldn't recommend this place. Me being from Hawaii, this place is not even close to how a poke bowl should taste.   I give them 1 star cause the gentleman that helped me was friendly & helpful but over all if the food don't taste good then, customer service can only go so far."}
{"text":"pricey for what they give you. JaBurrito offers similar and beyond dishes with 3 x more items in a bowl for under $11. This would be compared to JaBurritos bowls that are under $9! Its fresh here and I give it that. But I can get both fresh and more at JaBurrito."}
{"text":"We were invited to a soft opening for our company to try Soul Fish today, let me tell you how awesome that marketing strategy is!  Our office is directly behind Soul Fish and office eats out A LOT.    First off, I love the decor very clean beautiful colors compliment the wood framing in the entire restaurant.  The kitchen behind looked very clean and already well kept.   Second, the workers were great. Asked how are day was going, asked about our job, & lastly he made me his favorite poke bowl.  I love when employees are engaging and know what they like.    Last, the food was extremely good.  I loved the poke bowl I had with rice noodles, spicy tuna w/ sriracha mayo, seaweed salad, tempura crunch.  It couldn't have been more flavorful and everything went so well together.   Thank you for having us and we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean inside but food is very bad !! Not only fish ... Rice and noodle was not good too."}
{"text":"I was expecting amazing things since the reviews were so high. However, I was very disappointed. The crab meat was weird like it's been sitting out for awhile and just tasted the funny. The salmon was not fresh at all. I was afraid that I might get a stomachache due to the lack of freshness. They didn't have ponzu sauce so they told me there was yuzu sauce. The sauce didn't help cover up the old fish. On the plus side, the avocado was huge and great! Customer service was great but then again I was the only one there. They offer promotions such as free scoop of protein since the price is reflected upon how many scoops you get. Overall, with all of these poke places popping up this place is not my first choice."}
{"text":"Rice was hard, flavor lacking in all their sauces, and amount of fish not worth what they charge. There's better places in the nearby area that are cheaper, more generous with their fresher food. Definitely not eating here again :("}
{"text":"You hungry for a bowl of light, healthy food at $13?  Poke!    Monkey do:   $12.50 8oz Bowl:  Ahi tuna & salmon over brown rice & quinoa, topped w/mango, pineapple, edamame, wasabi peas, cucumber, tobiko+ $1, avocado+ $1   Dammit I wish read the sign. Seaweed salad is a dollar extra too. Really?  They should pay YOU a dollar to take that junk off their hands. Come on!  You want junk?  Go to Costco. Forgiven, but I wish they could roll it up into burrito. Monkey eat with hands.   Honestly, I like the choices here. Plenty of protein from fish, edamame & quinoa is pretty much what keeps me coming back on the way home. Never a line, clean restrooms and plenty of seating with outlets below. Oh and don't forget:  plenty of protein = plenty of gas. Plan ahead for that dentist appointment or carpool.   Monkey shall return. Follow at your own risk."}
{"text":"I've been to many poke places and this one is ok. Price is too high for just 1 scoop. You can get 3 scoops of different kinds of protein at other places for the same price. However, the flavor was on point and so was the service. I had the salmon with spicy garlic sauce and it was good. Hopefully they lower their price or add an extra scoop. I'd definitely try it again"}
{"text":"Too delicious..I'm addicted..going to try all the locations..and all the variety of bowls..can't wait..my favorite place when I want a taste of poke"}
{"text":"First and last time here! I don't even know where to begin! Place was empty at lunch time (now obviously I know why!) and the worker was nice but unprofessional. Food was horrible, I had to toss my entire meal, and so did my friend. The ahi tuna smelled and tasted very strange, I only ate like 2-3 pieces and I am really worried about getting food poisoning. Don't come here unless you want to get sick and waste your money (btw it's very pricey!)"}
{"text":"This place is great!! I'm new at this whole pokè bowl thing so they make it super easy for you when you have no idea what you're doing. The people were super friendly and explained everything to me. Portions are great, I opted for the smaller amount of protein I think 4oz.. and I was still full.  The seafood tastes super fresh, the place is cute, good vibes at the store, as the wise Arnold Schwarzenegger once said, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Love this place! I had the shrimp ceviche and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Such an unusual mix of ingredients like Thai - Mexican combo. Whatever - it was delicious. Everything seems very clean. Clean and fresh ingredients. The decor us very  nice, simple and again clean. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the worst place/food I've ever eaten in my life! And I'm not a picky eater love sushi and fish. But literally spend 35 on two bowls and two drinks and had to throw both away! Not to mention I got sick after eating it"}
{"text":"First time here, the place was empty. Waited about 3 minutes till someone came out. A guy came out- unfortunately it was not a great first impression. Asked him how this worked because it was our first time there. He briefly went through the process then asked what I wanted. Picked my base, then picked my fish, thought a little more of what I would want- he didn't seem too happy to be waiting on me. After all was said and done, paid for my food, took it to go- Didn't even get a bag. Then left. All in all it was a bad first impression, didn't feel like he was too happy we were in there ordering food.   Got home, started eating- not bad at all, it was pretty tasty. After a few more bites it didn't start to taste so good, maybe it was just me? Then took another bite (I had salmon) and bit into something hard and pokey- nearly choked on it, luckily I caught it before it went down my throat. There were 3 pretty long pieces of salmon bone in my food, one of which was loose and the other 2 were still attached to the salmon meat. --I was pretty livid. It just topped off my first and LAST experience here. I wasn't expecting to pay over $12.00 for rude service, and almost choking on food..."}
{"text":"This place is solid!!!!!!!! Delicious, reasonable priced and everything is so so fresh!  The service was quick and friendly. I had the spicy tuna with rice noodles and a number of their delicious fresh sauces! They have lots of veggies and items to make the bowls your own. 10/10 would eat here again"}
{"text":"After seeing the Henderson location appear on Eater frequently we were super stoked to see a location open in our neighborhood. I rushed over and ordered a to go lunch for us. I ordered the Passion (ahi) and Zen (salmon). The salmon bowl was delicious and fresh, and the citrus was a nice surprise. Unfortunately the ahi I got for my husband was not fresh; he couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Soo glad that I found this place it was DELISH!!!! Service was perfect Matt thank you for your help my bowl was perfect and congrats to you and your girlfriend with the baby coming that's exiciting!!"}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty. Flavors were bland if that. The only thing pleasant was the girl behind the counter.  This try on a new concept but I'm definitely not a fan"}
{"text":"After seeing a lot of thriving poké restaurants. This chain stuck out as one of the worst. This place takes away the art and flavor of what poké actually is. The fish that's used in these bowls are disguistingly maintained. I found myself gagging everytime I took a bite of the salmon. The rice was nearly uncooked and served cold. The sauce was nothing special and didn't make the almost-horrible bowl taste any better. As a previous resident of Hawaii, this place is NOTHING compared to what I've had. I will NEVER return to this establishment. There are many other places I've fallen head over heals for but this is not one of them. Also, any other poké place would be cheaper I might add.  I also found a hair in my bowl which was the cherry on top of the situation."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time of night (around 8pm) or because it was a boring Tuesday night complete with the VP debate on which presidential hopeful's foundation is more crooked (even though the question was about North Korea), but Soulfish Poké was not busy at all when I arrived.  There was literally just a couple at the counter completing their order, while I went about taking photos of this pleasantly decorated casual dining restaurant in the same plaza as SkinnyFat's SW location.  Even the normally packed parking lot was sparsely populated with just a dozen or so cars, probably all belonging to employees working at the restaurants that are still open.  So the guy holding down the fort alone had plenty of time to walk me through the ordering process. As this is my very first time at one of these Poké Bowl restaurants (which is the hottest restaurant to open at the moment in Las Vegas) I seriously thought I was done once I narrowed down my pick to the signature combos on one of their boards, but Matt, yes the guy mentioned in many previous reviews and tips, informed me that I still need to pick a base before the rest of the poké bowl could be assembled.  So for \"Passion\" (their most popular item) which consists of Ahi Tuna, Green Onion, Ginger, Sesame Seeds, Seaweed and Sesame Wasabi Glaze I overcame my past negative experience at Whole Foods with sushi roll made with healthy brown rice and decided to give Brown Rice another shot. Maybe it was the sauce, or the Tempura Crunch add-on, but this turned out to be really good. Definitely recommended for first timers or anyone overwhelmed by the billions of potential ingredient combinations and temporarily incapable of formulating a timely decision.   Spicy Spirit (Salmon, Jalapeños, Cucumber, Pineapple, Mango, Sriracha Powder, Teriyaki) was my second poké bowl, which I customized by opting for the recommended Quinoa and Mixed Greens, and sauced with Sweet Chili Gochujang Sauce (instead of Teriyaki).  It was simply delicious. The heat from the jalapeño slices was good, but eventually exceeded my Scoville Heat Units (SHU) tolerance limit.  The Quinoa on Mixed Greens combination made this truly a Poké Salad that is tasty and healthful.  Was it worth giving Netflix a break and getting out of the house?  Is the election process rigged?  Is it a bad idea to provide taxpayer money to build a Las Vegas stadium for the Raiders?  Does adding good vanilla ice cream to a good apple pie makes it just that much better?  Yes. Yes. YES. Yes.   It was definitely worth getting out of the house, driving past Desert Breeze Park, avoiding the peril of potentially running over any preoccupied Pokémon Go players that might dart out of the shadows, and the occasional bad drivers.  This would also be great for those looking for healthy alternative to break the doldrums of having to eat the same weeklong menu of a typical meal prep routine.   Oh yeah, no fountain drinks offered, but they have cans and bottles of beverages in a small fridge, as well as brewed teas to go with the rest of your order.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the second Soulfish Poké location I have visited in the past 24 hours. Today just happened to be their official grand opening, and just like the other location on Durango, it is not busy at night until I was about to finish my food (at 7:25pm). I practically have the entire restaurant to my self (the illusion is complete since the only customer is seated behind me all the way in the back, but he might be a reporter there to speak to the owner).  Service was plain, being a new place with new employees that are still learning the menu and the ropes, it is what it is. Pretty sure in a week he will be brimming with knowledge and personality just like Matt).  The owner(?) Edwin R was friendly bough to ask if I wanted something to drink, which I politely declined. I drank a lot of tea all day.  Anyway, love their decor. The artist they pick to work on the art incorporated into all of their locations did a great job.  There are plenty of seats and tables, but maybe during the lunch rush the situation will be different.  Parking lot is small, and not many open spots considering the neighbors in the same plaza.  Tonight I tried a large Zen (Salmon based Poké bowl) made with Edamame, a lot of Jalapeño, Green Onion, Orange Segments, and Orange Citrus Yuzu Sauce on a base of Rice Noodles. It was just alright, I barely tasted the Orange Citrus Yuhi Sauce, and overall it tasted dry. It is caused by a combination of not adding enough sauce and me ordering the Rice Noodle base, so the experience fell short of the amazing one I had last night.  (But being the official  day 1 of operation, I am not going to be too harsh but actually a bit more generous about my rating.)  Just keep in mind if Rice Noodle is selected as the base, ask the staff to be more generous with the sauce, since it can definitely absorb a lot of the sauce leaving the overall Poké bowl tasting bland and dry.  What's good? Fresh ingredients, order made pretty fast and it is healthy.  I will drop by again in a few days to check out their Buddha Bowl and Sutra (I am going to pass on the tofu-based Dharma, which will cater to the vegetarians possibly vegans amongst us).  Okay. Back to finishing my Poké bowl which is surprisingly filling, a compliment to the portion size considering I normally orders two entrees just for me)."}
{"text":"Great place for Poke' The food is amazing, We have to come back here for more, Matt the man who greeted us"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon and was excited to try it but the results were horrible. Ordered two bowls for myself and my boyfriend. He ordered the Buddha bowl which is supposed to be spicy tuna cucumbers etc etc. the tuna was ahi tuna with spicy sauce squirted on it not real spicy tuna I ordered salmon with spicy mayo both fishes (tuna &salmon) were not fresh at all tasted like it was frozen then thawed out and sat on the counter at room temp  The spicy mayo and soy sauce could not cover up the taste of unfresheness and the choices are very few. The fish and cucumbers were at room temp when I bit into it which is not good for sanitary reasons  Save your appetite for somewhere else and do your stomach a favor"}
