{"text":"I came to South Philly steak and fries and had a very poor experience.  First and foremost the cashier input the wrong sandwiches.  I ordered a chicken Philly with pepper jack and another chicken Philly with American.  It wasn't until the line cool Raymond was halfway through making our order that we realized we got overcharged.   After notifying the cashier she refunded us after waiting for 5+ minutes.  She then failed to notify Raymond that he was making the wrong food.  So we told Raymond that it was supposed to be a chicken Philly not steak.  He argued with us and replied that it was not wrang in that way.  He then argued with the cashier as well saying she entered provolone instead of pepper jack even though he was incorrect.  Overall very unproffesional.  In addition,  Raymond had the grill pulled out, and it looked as though the grill top hadn't been cleaned or scrapped in hours.  By the time our sandwiches were remade our cheesy fries were soft/cold and the cheese became gelatinous.  Poor service, poor communication,  poor quality of food.  Will not order here again."}
{"text":"4.99$ just to make it a meal?? Plus 7.95  for the sandwich. Wow!!! And to top it off bread was really dry and the skimped out on meat. Jesus!!! Never again! Stay away from this place and save your money!"}
{"text":"Staff ignored us as we waited at the counter. Someone finally walked up right as I was preparing to walk- in retrospect I wish I had. The girl taking our order was uninterested in helping and rang us up for the highest value of everything before we could say what sizes then seemed annoyed to have to change it. She didn't ask us about the options (type of meat and cheese) and seemed annoyed again to have to bother with us. In the end we  shouldn't have bothered specifying since they paid no attention to our requests. Food was mediocre and the cheese was not noticeable. Asked for a cup for water and was given a tiny Dixie cup (the kind for rinsing after brushing your teeth), I mean I get it you want people to spend money on soda- but come on now."}
{"text":"Customer service is unbelievable. We came here on Mother's Day and were appalled by the attitude of the workers. My 3 month old son is allergic to dairy and his mother is breastfeeding - so we asked for a Philly cheesesteak and requested to have cheese on only half of the sandwich. The cashier proceeded to ask the cook about the order and she replied with a loud and snarky, \"Yeah. I'm not doing that.\" Because apparently it's too difficult for her to put cheese on only half of the meat. As we were walking away, we saw the other workers giving us dirty looks and clearly making comments.  Needless to say, we took our business elsewhere, sharing our experience with everyone we know and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bad bad too much high prices i Old meat very old fries all driy beware"}
{"text":"South philly. Was the worst dinner I have had in a long time. Here I was expecting a hot steak sandwich, but what I got was a warm sandwich that the cheese was hardly melted. The bun was stale and I was told they were out of onions.  When we asked for ketchup they were out of that too. I went to the vendor next door for ketchup. I don't know how they stay in business"}
{"text":"We had ordered two burgers, one came with one inch sharp metal piece. Luckily, my friend did not get hurt from chowing down. The manager has bad attitude and frighten about to call security when I was trying to communicate with him the incident. Poor management, poor food safety awareness."}
{"text":"I went to this place on Sunday and I have the worst food I have ever had anywhere and I have ate a lot of Mall food the bread was stale I had their new sandwich the American Philly which they were out of American cheese there was hardly any meat the lettuce that tasted pretty there was no kind of sauce whatsoever and they were out of mayonnaise packets and hardly any meat and the bread was awful I waited 20 minutes for this piece of crap and with the sandwich and a drink it was over $11 I will never go here again don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Really should have consulted yelp before going there.... The sandwich was ok at most though definitely not tasty but the fries were the most disgusting ones I ever got in the U.S. Soggy. Greasy. Just bad.  Should have chosen the salad & wraps place next counter which did look quite tasty on other tables.  Not that I could not have been warned before. If I'd had consulted yelp in advance."}
{"text":"I ate at this establishment on 12/17/17.  While I was waiting in line to order, I noticed a young man carrying a tray of bread behind the cashier.  He turned quickly and one of the buns fell off, to which he said, \"F**k this sh*t!\"  Not the best way to leave a first impression, but I ordered anyway.  Three soft drinks were out of order and one of the speciality teas wasn't available.  So we settled for water and a non preferred soft drink.  We ordered mozzarella sticks and they were out of marinara.  The cashier didn't seem excited to be working (no greeting or smile), but the young ladies who were cooking and expediting food were working hard.  It took 20 minutes to receive our food, but it was hot and fresh.  Morale didn't seem very high and I couldn't tell who, if anyone, was in charge.  I won't be back due the above events and the $56 bill for 3 people to eat.  That's almost $20 a person!  We could've gone to a nice restaurant for that price.  My hope is that management reads this and finds a way to build morale and keep up inventory.  Bringing the price down would be a big plus as well."}
{"text":"While Waiting for my food to be ready the cook was scrubbing the counter with soap. He never changed his gloves or washed his hands. Saw him grab the bacon with his hands and put it in the microwave. I had to ask him to change his gloves and make me another cheddar bacon fries. Please be careful when you eat here."}
{"text":"Decent food court option: it's pricey like airport food, though. $8+ for a large sandwich, $4 to add a small drink/fry, $6 for a regular drink/fry add-on. It gets pricey fast.  But on the bright side, the cheesesteaks are actually pretty tasty. Your choice of cheese, several combinations of mushrooms, peppers, onions, etc. You can also customize fries and add cheese, gravy, chili, and other toppings. Not a place to hit on a diet."}
{"text":"Where's the beef? Not in my sandwich. I ordered the mini cheesesteak....but this is ridiculous. My iced tea was $5. This mall food court is pretty slim pickings, but skip this place!"}
{"text":"Having lost a bet earlier in the morning which required me to buy lunch for my partner, this was not where I had intended to bring him.  You see...I like my partner and the last thing I would want to do after loosing a bet would be to buy him a meal which possibleycould have destroyed his lower intestine.  More on that later......  The intent after loosing the bet (and consorting with the oracle that is yelp) was to visit a food truck that according to the information provided to yelp was supposed to be open and located at the Las Vegas Outlet Mall.  This was not to be.  After parking and walking, and walking while following the dot on my smartphone, said food truck could not be located...excitement led to frustration  After calling the food truck with no success, it was agreed upon we would ask the local courtesy patrol if the food truck was indeed located somewhere about the premises.  Contact was made with a very nice gentleman serving in said capacity. He directed us to where the food truck to was supposed to be.  More walking.  Alas, it was not there.  Frustration turns to sadness.  We walked back to ringmaster of personal protection and property preservation to seek an alternative.  He spoke very highly of South Philly Steak & Fries located in the food court.  Sadness turned to trust and away we went. Now..food courts sort of freak me out like clowns do for some people but having a \"local\" tell us it was good, we headed on over.  NOTE TO SELF AND OTHERS PACKING A SMART PHONE LOADED WITH THE YELP APP,  ALWAYS CHECK IN PRIOR TO ORDERING.  BETTER YET!  DO YOUR RESEARCH PRIOR!!!  The line was negotiated with ease.  There was no one there.  The order taker offered no real assistance and was simply a button pusher.  I ordered up a Philly   cheese steak with mushrooms and cheese.  \"Disco Fries\" containing provolone cheese and gravy caught my eye and so they were also ordered.  My partner ordered up a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  Both meals combined thus settling my debt came to $30 and some change!  FML.  We sat down in the food court area while our meals were being prepared.  The sounds banging off the walls reminded me of the acoustics in a junior high cafeteria.  I must say there were was a lot of interesting people to watch.  This is when I checked in.  Damn!  Having now seen the rating of SPCS&F and already having earned my \"Maverick\" badge, I knew there might be a high probability the meal might suck.  Trust turned to doubt.  There was some conversation about the price paid for what was a relatively simple meal.  I deduce the inflated prices are to pay for the six employees behind the counter yucking it up.  Our number was called and off I went to retrieve our meal.  Taking a look at the tray, I felt like the jackass character of the cartoons of my youth.  My disco fires looked like frumpy octogenarians square dancing.  The Philly was so soggy it could have either been cooked in a microwave or steam room.  My doubt now turned to regret.  Over inflated prices with subpar service in a food court turned my regret into a nightmare."}
{"text":"1st off, if I could choose NO STARS, I would!  The guy that was making the food kept the SAME pair of gloves on the ENTIRE time he was making all of the food. Here's how it went: My son orders a cheeseburger, the guy who took the order puts on gloves, puts the buns, and then the burger on the flat top. The next employee comes over. Puts on gloves, grabs two more patties, puts those on the flat top, THEN grabs the buns, then grabs onions, peppers, and mushrooms. THEN grabs two meat slices for a Philly sandwich, puts those on the flat top, grabs the bun for that, turns around and touches the touchscreen, and then something else on the wall (buttons). He then turns around and grabs fries to put in the basket for frying, tossed a couple of baskets of fries already frying, then grabs 3 chicken strips, and puts in, and then touches the touchscreen again. He then turns back around, flips a couple of burgers, places the weight back on them, and then proceeds to flip & chop up the Philly meat and place the cheese on it. He then grabs the bun for the Philly sandwich, and proceeds to fill it with its contents, wraps it up, and grabs a tray, some napkins, and serves it to that customer. He then grabs three more trays, along with a small stack on napkins for each tray, and the receipts to go with them. He then turns around, and continues to flip the remaining burgers, and check the buns for those burgers as well.   Now... Keep in mind: NOT ONE SINGLE TIME DID HE CHANGE HIS GLOVES OR WASH HIS HANDS.   Before he even attempts to touch my sons food, I ask him not to touch the food. He looks at me like I'm crazy, and I ask the other guy, who has just recently put on a pair of gloves, and who had grabbed my son's bun and set it on the wrapping paper to be completed, to please finish off my son's burger. He states that he's trying to complete other orders. I explain that he (pointing to the same glove wearing guy) has not changed his gloves, and proceed to tell him everything that he has touched in the few minutes that I've been standing there watching, and so Mr. Same Gloves gets an extremely pissed off look on his face, and goes to change his gloves. When he cones back, I tell him my son wants lettuce on his burger, but he proceeds to close the burger, and wrap it up. At thus point, I'm beyond... Well, just BEYOND everything, and he hands the burger to me and says, \"Here.\" My son gets his burger,and says, \"Mama, where's my lettuce?\" To which I respond with, \"Boy, I wasn't going to let that man touch anything else that was going to go in your body. Just enjoy your burger.\"  NEVER EVER have I seen SO much cross contamination in an open grill/flat top place in my life.  NEVER EVER going there again, and I recommend that no one else does either if they value their health."}
{"text":"Horrible. Avoid at all cost. Cold cheese on a Philly cheese steak!?!?They did not allow the cheese to melt all the way through.   The bacon cheese fries were cold to the touch.   The fried pickles tasted like old oil."}
{"text":"The picture looks good but in reality it's not as good!  I ordered the steak one and it was soooooo salty and burnt!!! It would have been good if it was not over cooked and over salted!"}
{"text":"First the bread tasted stale, hardly and steak on my sandwich and the cheese tasted like craft singles yuck! One good thing there fries are great."}
{"text":"Service and variety of choices was good. The basic cheese steak was not very tasty at all. They need to season the meat. Even the roll could have been a better quality. Just the sandwich with onions and cheese is 8 bucks. I have tried Charley's Steaks at another mall and those are really much better.  I really wanted to like this place, but maybe if things change, I will return."}
{"text":"Where to start... 3 lady cashiers too busy talking to properly take your order.  Had to repeat it 3 times . Then She was still talking and filled the drinks only 3/4 the way full     Manager came out the back and instead of fixing the problem, started gossiping with them.  Very very poor customer service for the premium price for there food. Recommend starving before stopping here as it will be a less painful experience."}
{"text":"Very good cheese steaks sandwich! Soft and delicious. It's located at the food court of Las Vegas North Premium Outlets. Not many choices there, this South Philly Cheesesteaks & Fries I consider the best compared to 5 other food stalls in the same building. Well, be careful it's addictive!"}
{"text":"We are asking for a combo but they charge me separately  n the french fries overcooked the french fry is overcooked. Spend time & money will never go back again well now we're go back again will never go back again?"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews first. Food wasn't that great and to top it off it was 31.19 for two people!!! Way overpriced."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Was sandbagged with a $27 bill for a steak and fries bowl, and sandwich. Careful when ordering!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food at an unexpected place. Express service, great taste. Don't know why the current review is so low. Fantastic break point in a long shopping"}
{"text":"I hate hate hate writing reviews like this. This is the type of place that I would hesitate to even think of trying again & it was all due to service.  I came here with my parents yesterday after getting some cards at an event to try a free cheesesteak and drink. We disclosed this to the cashier who said very loudly and extremely rudely, \" we don't give free food here.\" We kindly mentioned they were received at an event the day before at thier mall and asked to speak with a manager if possible. While the manager listened better, they said that all parties had to be present. We nicely said that my mom was sitting down with my daughter (18 months) and nephew (1 yr old). My dad asked if it was really needed and my mom waved as she could tell something was up. That seemed to have sufficed. They rang us up for the fries we ordered and we left.  We will not eat there again due to the lack of customer service. It was rude and embarrassing. I totally get that it may have been a communication issue, however there are ways to handle it that don't make guests feel bad. The real shame here for them as a business is that my parents frequent the mall with the kids about 2-4 times a week and would have likely gone there often had they treated them well."}
{"text":"Not impressed and I was really looking forward to trying it.  Got a cheesesteak with onions and mushrooms and cheese sauce.  The vegetables were al dente and needed to be cooked much longer.  The cheese sauce was under the food and not on top which I prefer.  The cheese sauce also was not tasty.  The best part of the meal were the fries and the vinegar they have available to put on top.  For two cheesesteaks, one fries and one disgusting sweet BBQ order of chicken wings the bill was $27.  For a food court meal!  Ick!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, reading through the other reviews I don't think people know how to adjust expectations... You are in an outlet mall aka tourist trap...you are in Las Vegas aka everything is overpriced...you are in s food court, you really expect gourmet food or halfway decent service? Lmao. Oh by the way, have you ever had a cheesesteak from the places that originally created them in philly? They are horrid.  I got the #4 which is cheesesteak with onions, mushrooms, peppers and went with provolone cheese.  Did not get fries since the sandwich is plenty of self punishment already...  On to the review, 5 stars, - 1 because it's overpriced,  -1 because it was an average \"stereotypical Philly cheesesteak shop\", -1 because the staff is not great...-1 because peppers on cheesesteaks are supposed to be HOT peppers not red and green peppers ikr? +2 because people watching in international tourist traps is superb, especially in the nice shady outdoor seating area.  You want lunch, not many other options, it's fine. Better than the subway next door at least right?"}
{"text":"Worst lunch place in SHV.  Waited for about 20 minutes for a sandwich and fries.  The cook was working hard, but the girl behind the counter only cared about what was going on on her phone.  She wouldn't help him at all even though he asked multiple times.  The wait alone would make me skip this next time.  They use the term fast food very loosely here."}
{"text":"Ok this places those not even deserve one star this places is trash just like the costumer services they don't even understand how to make an order right they are rude people they messed up in my order like three times and they gave me an Attitude about it i will Ricoh menu to spend you're money some where els instead of this trash restaurant Believe me"}
{"text":"The steak sandwhich is dry the meat tastes closer to jerky. The dries are pretty decent but not great. The serving size is generous and the service was friendly. But the price does not match the quality and poor taste."}
{"text":"It's a food court location at the outlet mall for overpriced sandwich. I decided to stand in this long line and after getting to the cashier was I notified they ran out of steak.   How do you run out of steak and a philly steak establishment. Why did they not announce it to the line. I did not want chicken since that was the only option. So, I left after wasting 20minutes of my life that I'll never get back and went hungry standing in another line at the food court. From what i saw other people were eating, the sandwiches did not even look that appetizing at all. I should have listened to the yelp reviews. Good luck if you're going to eat here!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here for loaded cheese fries because we wanted a snack to hold us over until dinner. It seemed OK at first, but the cashier struggled to get our order entered, and we had to keep repeating what we wanted. When we did finally get our order and got it over to the tables in the food court, we found out that it had been both entered wrong and as a result made wrong.   I had to go back to the counter to ask for the side that should have already been with the fries, and had to wait in line to even get someone's attention for help even though I already waited in line and paid for my food the first time. While I was standing in line waiting, I noticed that the same cashier made mistakes on two other peoples' orders. The food itself was very good, but the service was frustrating. I would be willing to go back and give them another try because the food was good, but hopefully they can get their service up to par."}
{"text":"Over priced menu for subpar food  12$ for a cheese steak sandwich and over cooked fries   pass up"}
{"text":"Food was hot.  Soda syrup on Pepsi needed adjusting. Fries were not bad. Had a mini steak and the bun was almost steal. Got a 3 because of the fries.  The wait line was dirty with trash. I was here at an off rush time and should not be that messy."}
{"text":"I have never submitted a Yelp review before, but after paying $18 dollars last night for the worst meal I have ever had, I thought it only fair to warn others.  Walking through the food court with my daughter we pass South Philly Steak & Fries.  It smells good and there's a crowd so it must be good right?  Wrong!  The cooks had no idea what they were doing.  One kid had been standing there for 20 minutes waiting on chicken nuggets.  Finally 15 minutes later our order arrives.  It was the worst tasting Philly sandwich I have ever had.  Bland, with no taste and the lettuce was soggy.  Also, the fries were burned.  There was nothing redeeming about this dining experience.    I agree with Jon K.  I don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"I've waited longer for my food at this place than I ever have at a restaurant. I watched two people get there food before me that ordered after I did.  The cashier, which I think is the manager Zach? Was wearing a villa pizza T-shirt while not helping the cook who was by himself besides the other guy standing watching everyone."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. We got the steak bowl over fries. It took a looooong time to be ready. Fries were good (lots of them, and lots of bell peppers and onion but not much  meat.) Over $16 for a bowl, a side of fries and a soda."}
{"text":"Went to the outlet mall in search of a cafe that was nowhere to be found. One of the mall's finest recommended Steak and Fries and raved about it. I guess you can't blame a guy for talking up the very place he is paid to protect, but this place was not good. At best it was fast food quality at restaurant prices in a food court.   They were not busy by any stretch, but had six cackling employees behind the counter carrying on like geese in heat. Their mating calls could be heard echoing throughout the food court.   The food took too long and my bacon cheeseburger was just \"middle of the road.\" The fries were decent, but only warm. I was expecting hot, fresh fries. No such luck. Lunch for two was thirty bucks! There were a few other options inside the food court but you might be better off leaving the property for lunch if this place is any indication of how the other eateries are.  Only two stars this go round. The service, food quality and price all combined to make this a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"You usually can't expect much from a food court.  However, this place is probably the best option at the village.  Each sandwich is made to order.  This makes for some longer wait times, but also ensures you get a hot and fresh sandwich and fries.  This also makes for higher prices.  I ordered the chicken cheesesteak with fries and a drink.  At $14 it is a little much for food court food.  You can get a meal at Red Robin for cheaper, so I'm not sure how long this place will last.  However, the flavor made up for the cost.  The bread on the sandwich was fresh, the meat was tender, and it was one of the best chicken cheesesteaks I've had in a long time.  The fries were also pretty good.  With the limited options in shv, this is definitely the place to try if you don't mind spending a few bucks."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I paid 11 for a nasty philly that I threw away after the first bite. The customer service was horrible, rude people working there."}
{"text":"Worst Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had! Not sure if it's the seasoning on the beef or the beef but it has no flavor and very bland. Waste of $10! Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has the chance to be great, but unfortunately it just isn't there right now. We wanted a snack to hold us over during the in between time of lunch and dinner, so we headed over for some fries to share. The cashier seemed confused about how to ring up our order. It was clear that this was truly the case when our order came out and was incorrect - so upon checking the receipt we noticed it was rung in incorrectly.  My husband headed back up to their store front to let them know that it wasn't what we ordered, and after a wait to get someone's attention, we finally had the correct one.   Sadly, the food didn't make up for the service and being ignored to fix the initial error. The cheese was luke warm and the bacon really didn't have any flavor.   Overall: C- Poor service and just mediocre food. There are plenty of other options in this food court, so this place is a future pass."}
{"text":"I chose to eat here after seeing \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" at the IMAX in 3d yesterday. A  steak sandwich with mushrooms sounded much more appetizing than any of the other vendor choices in the food court. The roll was toasted the way I like it and the sandwich tasty, also like I like it.  I would have given 5 stars had the employee I asked for napkins actually spoken instead of just pointing to the girl with the napkins and that girl had actually placed them on my tray with a smile instead of tossing them at me like she hated her job."}
{"text":"So I recommend you take your money elsewhere. They completely forgot my order and didn't even make it after waiting 15min for just a standard philly. They skipped me by 10 numbers and when I brought it to their attention they made it in 2 min. No consideration or anything for messing it up. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Love this place know that it's under new management! Everything is fresh and is made exactly how you ordered one of the Best made to order place! The crew all work as a team and the managers help with everything you need! All and all a great place to eat and a great experience!"}
{"text":"I won't be as harsh as the other reviews that I read on Yelp. The Philly steak was decent they could have let the cheese melt a little bit longer. The price is ok for food courts. I don't know if I was just starving or what but it wasn't as bad as some of the Yelp reviews. I don't know if I'll come back but as of right now it wasn't as bad as everyone is making it seem"}
{"text":"I thought we would try South Philly Steak & Fries. As we walked up to the cashier she stood there staring into space for about 1 min before she even acknowledged I was standing there waiting to order. She finally acknowledged me with a rude tone can I help you. I ordered our meals and when she handed me my drinks she only gave me one, I said to her we had 2 and she replied no you only ordered one (which is incorrect, I ordered 2). After getting the order corrected my total for 2 sandwiches, 2 fries and 2 sodas was $27. I was shocked on how expensive it was. I walked over the gentlemen making the sandwiches and he kept giving me a dirty look as he was slamming the spatula against the grill. So I asked him if something was wrong and why he kept giving me a dirty look, and he replied rudely to me I'm just doing my job as he laughed. After he continued to give me dirty creepy looks for no reason I had enough, and decided I would not be giving my money to this business, so I politely asked the manager for my money back. He asked me what happened and never once offered a apology for his workers disrespectful behavior. I will NEVER do business with this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. The service on the other hand was absolutely terrible. Both workers present seemed like they did not want to be there. Don't expect to have friendly service."}
{"text":"Utterly DISGUSTED when I saw an employee stand over the onions, peppers, and mushrooms and COUGH right over them. The girl standing next to him looked like it was no big deal. I asked for a manager. The manager came and said she would dump them out and add new vegetables...don't think she apologized. But the big question is did she really dump them out and clean the buckets like she said? GROSS!!!! Never going back! Hire people with home training that know how to cough covering their mouths with their sleeve and not into a bucket of food!"}
{"text":"This is a new Philly cheesesteak restaurant in Arizona Mills Mall. It looks like it replaced Great Steak and Potato which used to be one of my favorite quick service restaurants in AZ Mills. Arizona Mills is doing a big food court overhaul and this seemed to be one of many new restaurants.  I was not impressed. I got the buffalo chicken philly, which is what I always used to get at Great Steak. It was extremely salty and the chicken was like deli slices instead of an actual chopped up chicken breast. It was drowning in sauce and so salty I downed two waters afterwards. I realize that I should not expect a ton from a quick service restaurant in the mall but Great Steak used to make this sandwich so well and this was no where near the same quality. It took about ten minutes to get one sandwich which wasn't too bad. Overall, bad food. I will not be back."}
{"text":"VERY disappointing service! Long wait to order, long wait before food was even started, long wait to receive food. Order buffalo chicken sandwich and fried pickles. Sandwich had no buffalo sauce and only a little meat. I had to BEG the guy to put the sauce on because he kept saying I said no sauce. (I didn't want ranch or blue cheese) Cheese wasn't melted. Pickles sat on counter the entire time. I paid $11 for food I'm too upset to eat. I will NEVER order anything from this place again... EVER!"}
{"text":"Too damn slow!!! Waited about 6 minutes in line. Then another 15 minutes for my food. Then my order was WRONG!!! The was a first and only time for this place."}
{"text":"Save your $! Skimpy on the steak, not the most flavorful, and they wanted to charge me extra for LETTUCE! Are you serious. I spent $25 for me and my child. Better steak sandwiches elsewhere at a better value."}
{"text":"The loaded Philly sandwich was delicious and they prepared it very quickly on a busy Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Don't come here hungry for breakfast.  Cause they do NOT have their sh*t together.  Stood in line while the guy tried to figure out how to work the register for like 30 minutes.  It was between the Chipotle style place the next stall over, or this place.  And neither were moving people through the line.  With a hungry toddler, you can imagine how fun THAT was..waiting to just order food.    The food was mediocre.  We ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches - one with sausage and one with steak.  Honestly, I could have made the same thing at home. And better.  So save your money and eat before you arrive (which we intended on doing, but every restaurant in the area was packed)."}
{"text":"This place is OK. I have only had the Chicken Philly sandwich and it has been really good each time that I have had it. My husband ordered the bacon ranch fries and by the time that he received his food, it was cold. He then had to take it back so that they could remake it. He said that his food was actually good after he received a fresh hot order. So it's a thumbs up for me but it's not the best that I have ever had either. So if you are in the mall and looking for something decent to eat, this place would be good if you order the Chicken Philly sandwich. One thing that I was not happy about is the fact that they are a bit over priced. My regular sandwich and my husbands Bacon Ranch Fries ended up costing us over $14, which is a bit ridiculous to me. So if you don't want to spend that much or more for two people to eat, I would say look elsewhere because it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Cashier (guy with glasses, no name tag) gave my 9 year old daughter attitude when she asked questions. Charge extra for pickles on her hamburger? Really? Since when isn't that a standard item on a hamburger? Just overall rude man ... Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Food was average."}
{"text":"Food is good. Better than Charlie's in my opinion. But sadly you don't get enough food for what you pay for and on top of that the service is fucking slow and awful. Definitely don't come here for quick food."}
{"text":"Horrible HORRIBLE customers service.   And that is just to start. Was here on May 25th, 2018, at approximately 228. The female at the register had the worse attitude, so I thought. When we came across the cooks they were even worse! I ask for jalapenos and with attitude, because says \"we don't have jalapenos, were not Subway.\" So I asked for lettuce and tomatoes. They told me they have at that it is an extra charge. Never EVER coming back here! $40 for 3 meals!! Fries were good. Sandwich is NOT! bread is soggy and the sandwich is flavorless."}
{"text":"Had never eaten here before and asked a question to the cashier.. She responded by saying \"this isn't subway\" and was rude the whole tome"}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but it seems they have hired new employees since my last visit.   The cashier took forever to ring up the guy in front of me, and when it was my turn to order HE ANSWERED HIS PHONE and talked to them for a few minutes before asking if I was going to order.  Obviously if I was standing in line....  15 minutes went by after that encounter and my mini sandwich and fries were finally done.  They wasted my entire 30 minute break. Now I must eat on my time, unpaid."}
{"text":"Old  cashier dude with skin disease is not only slow and rude but steals. Did not give change and refused when confronted.  Owner/management please control your staff and don't hire people who shouldn't be employed in customer services roles if they can't do their job properly."}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch while in Concord Mills.  Ordered the small philly cheesesteak value meal (includes fries and drink).  Requested no onions.  This was close to 11 am, so there was no line.  Preparation time was to me unexpectedly show.  The person that took my order had a name tag labeling him as an assistant manager. He carried on some polite small talk as I waited for my order.  The employee fixing the food was a male with very long dreadlocks (halfway down his back).  Not all of his hair was tied in the back. so 95% of his hair was not restrained under his hat.  Made me question the sanitation of the meal preparation.    Speaking of meal preparation, they included the onions that I had requested to not be on the sandwich.  The food court has many food options.  I would advise trying them and avoiding this one."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, eat somewhere else. The food is over-priced, prepared poorly, and the service would have to vastly improve just to suck. A major issue with this poor excuse for a food stand is the fact that it is owned by the same group that owns the \"vendors\" on either side. Frankly, none of them seem to give a damn."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday...really busy day and all of the eateries had lines and only a few seats available in the dining area. This was the first and last time I will ever order from this one. The cashiers line wasn't too bad. I had 3 people ahead of me and about 3 more that had placed their orders and were waiting. The cashier spoke in short hand (just kidding), however if you were not aware of the menu, you weren't given much opportunity to make up your mind. It's best to know exactly what you want, even if you've never been there before. The area behind the counter wasn't very spacious and there were about 5 people working. (Your cashier, 2 cooks on the grill and 2 people bagging the orders and preparing trays). There was a lot of clanking and movement on the grill, leading you to believe there was a lot of cooking going on. Well, I ordered Fries and Steak sandwich (no cheese). My fries were hot, however had so much  oil that I could have used the excess to cook something else. My steak sandwich was lukewarm... and that's being kind. I didn't not want to deal with the crowd and then trying to find a table. I ate my heart-attack on a plate, even though I was full. I was completely dissatisfied.  So, Thanks, but NO THANKS."}
{"text":"OK food. Nothing great, mall food  Good food a hold lunch if you happen to be at the mall. Rain forest cafe has much better food but does cost more. Staff friendly and looked clean. I would go back.  I had the Phily finest cheese steak meal."}
{"text":"Really over priced. This is my first time eating here and it was over 30 dollars for two people. The man who took my order accidentally charged me for 3 sodas and when he realized the mistake,  gave me back the extra money and threw my receipt away,  I'm sure there were other pricing mistakes. It was 2.50 for a large soda that I didn't even say that I wanted. They didn't ask about any specifications on my order. Also,  the menu that constantly changes so you can't look at the price of things, didn't include a price for drinks. Don't go here."}
