{"text":"Now located in the Wyndham Garden hotel. We ordered a fried chicken meal with French fries and chicken strips for our kid. It took about 20 minutes to get our food. The chicken was tough and bland and the fries were raw. It's like they forgot to do the second fry. The chicken strips appeared to have been prepackaged and frozen. The dining room was very dirty. There was food stuck to the walls and there was an actual pile of dirt on the floor next to our table. A PILE OF DIRT! I do not recommend this place an in fact suggest you avoid."}
{"text":"Our experience was not the best unfortunately. Truth be told, we got there late, just after 8pm, on a Saturday, though we did call prior to make sure they could accomodate us and were told they could.  They were short staffed (2, the chef and one server) with having a catered event and the chef had been there since 5am and was exhausted.  We actually felt bad for him having to cook for us.  Food was just ok - steak cooked to order but was pricey for what it was.  Just wasn't the experience we were hoping for.  On a side note, the town of Gifford was struck by a tornado last year.  I'm not certain the number of homes that had been leveled, but the rebuilding process if is full swing with more then 43 homes already rebuilt.  We were told that after the tornado, Bibs stayed open for 3 days straight in order to assist in feeding those who either lost everything or were there serving in recovery efforts.  For that, this establishment gets a tip of the hat."}
{"text":"Oh My!!!! The real deal! From the fried chicken to the enormous hamburgers, it is a great little eatery. Leave room for pie."}
{"text":"Great fries, hamburgers are excellent, and the chicken good to. Folks who work there are friendly, and provide good service."}
