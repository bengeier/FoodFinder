{"text":"As soon as I walk in, it is a very vibrant and inviting space. Roland quickly greeted me and was super helpful in explaining all the options I had. As someone who doesn't drink coffee they offer a great selection for an alternative. I ended up choosing the matcha green tea. I have had a lot of matcha in my past and the one served here was very smooth and not gritty. They go through a whole process of actually serving matcha the way it is supposed to. I enjoyed my tea with a delicious biscotti while admiring all the great art work. I would definitely come back and it is such a great and unique idea!"}
