{"text":"Lady Yelper that FTR'd Hatam feels uncomfortable in Persian restaurants?  Now you know how Dudes feel stepping inside Cosmetic stores, Yoga studios, Spas and Nail salons.  I'm more adventurous nowadays, but years ago I keep 1km radius from those dropzones.  Vaziri Kebab ($10.99)  Bademjoon ($6.99) Doogh (Mint, Soda version $ 1.99) Istak (Pineapple $1.50)  Polo overload for sure while my Friend quit after what she claims to be 2-mountains(?) of Persian Rice.  Her Food vocab is work-in-progress.  To speak the same linguo, I had the other 5-mountains.  Not to speak of the Raw Onion/Radish/Parsley I chowed on.  I was fully loaded leaving Hatam, to my surprise.  Definitely value-added.   3.5 *Star*  Kebabs showed signs of flame-marks and came with the usual suspects(Butter, Roast Tomato).  Nothing out of the ordinary except I've realized now Persian Stews aren't my go-to except when it comes with tender Veal Shanks.  The Bademjoon of Eggplant, cubed Veal, Tomato sauce and Capers didn't entice me as much as Britney Spears on Persian Television.  That casual dressed staff dude knows that we're SMART just from the orders.  Flattery got through to my Friend, except she didn't realize I'm the one who chose all the Food.   Dude calls out the order to his Dad at the back like my Persian Friend did at home to his parents.  I'm feeling the Persian-ality."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the food and the prices! I go there a lot! Im getting hungry just thinking about it! :)"}
{"text":"I would never go there. I order kebab and don't get me wrong I've tried in a lot of placed. Meet did not look fresh for me and pita they brought seemed to be from Walmart or any other store. Number two onion they brought me... It killed me, basically onion cut in 2 pieces and served with meat. Does not seem to be restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Not much to say, kebabs made me and my husband very sick.  They get one star for being nice to us when we were finally ready to order, but the greeting into the restaurant was very cold, not welcoming at all.  Even the customers gave us dirty looks walking in."}
{"text":"3.5 star   Hatam Restaurant is located in the Village of Richmond Hill.   I am here surprising NOT for their lunch specials.. though they do have for $5.99 for take out only!! But I love staying in and enjoy the ambiance and the services... and I don't mind paying a little more for that, instead of eating from  Styrofoam containers! BTW, those cushion seats looked so comfy... my Yelp friend was like shooking his head when I dashed over and sank myself into one of those!  The menu has all the standard Persian offerings of kebab and stews, which are all priced reasonable with big portions!   We decided on:   Vaziri Kebab ($ 10.99)  - one skewer of Koobiedeh and one skewer of Joajeh Kebab  - Both nicely seasoned and really tender   Bademjoon ($ 6.99)  - Seasoned eggplant and veal served with rice cooked in a tomato sauce with capers  - Veal was disappointing tough and with not much flavour. when I think of stew, I expect the meat will be soft and tender...   Doogh ($ 1.99) and Istak Drink ($1.50) were great to wash down our Persian lunch...   Hatam Restaurant's friendly staffs made me feel comfortable and I really enjoyed their hospitality... Now I think I might be brave enough to go into a Persian restaurant by myself?? or Am I ready?"}
