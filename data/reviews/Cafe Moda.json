{"text":"It's really dark inside because of the \"club\" feel.  I wish there was more lighting than the little candles they put on the table.  Also, the music is really loud, so I wouldn't bring a date here.  You literally have to yell to each other if you want to say something.  Also, you have to put up with the karaoke divas.  Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're not.  It's a risk you have to take.  The dance floor was dead, but that's because none of the music was hype.  Lol.  Aside from all that, the food is really good!  They make hella good sisig.  Also their crispy pata is good too!  I tried their pancit a while back and had no complaints.  There's not many places to get sisig in Vegas, so this place can satisfy that craving.  Good food, just some things you have to put up with.. ^_^"}
{"text":"Very cool place .  music food you cant go  wrong. I wish there were more places like this in Vegas.  All you stuffy  critic's can go to lame ass pts.."}
{"text":"Love this Place..Friendly people, Love the Kareoke and Dancing... Abit too Loud for Dinner but dont mid..:) Dont know if for Family outing ;never been here during the day, but Great for  Late night weekend....Food, Dancing, &Karaoke"}
{"text":"Food is really good at this place but the service sucks so bad. Female servers are horrible and need more training. We waited for a to go box for half hour plus if I don't even go to the bar to have our check she won't even remember it. We were done eating at 9 pm and didnt get it leave by 10ish. And I think it will be more wait if I don't go to the front to check it. Horrible service I ever had. I wouldn't come there again even if I like the food."}
{"text":"The food here is so good.  If you are going to try one thing here, please try the sisig.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!  Their sisig is not the typical one that you would get anywhere else.  Sisig is supposed to be various pork meats (I'm not even mentioning what cuts of pork it is) with peppers and spices with a side of lemon, served on a sizzling platter.  Their version is what I would call chicharrón chopped up into smaller pieces.  But nonetheless...it saves me time from picking out the \"bad\" pieces of pork, and instead lets me enjoy it instead.  Their sisig, or whatever is should be called is delicious!!!  It can get \"ghetto,\" depending on the night you come in.  It's pretty much hit-or-miss.  One night, it was \"tango\" themed.  Pretty cool watching the couples dance formally.  Some nights it'll be middle-aged women getting their groove on.  Not a pretty picture.  But other than that...nothing like good food and cheap entertainment from the karaokers to get the night rolling."}
{"text":"Good food but customer service is slow and unorganized.  Had a Togo order that I called in and it took over an hour!"}
{"text":"5 stars!! This late night cafe is the go-to spot after clubbing all night long. Not very pretty on the outside and not a whole lot better looking in the inside, but what I like about this place is the SISIG, the Resident/house DJ, and the fact that I feel like I'm truly at a late night club in the Philippines.   The food is deliciously pricey, but that's okay when you're splitting the tab with your entire party. I suggest getting the sisig!!   The DJ is the best spinning DJ ever, and no, I'm not kidding.    In between all the food, drinks and music... KARAOKE is obviously not ignored. this part of the cafe makes it feel like home.   Every time I'm in LV I make sure I visit this place."}
{"text":"The people here are nice. The environment is fun and the DJ is pretty decent but only plays EDM and Latin music. There's a lot of items on the menu that they don't actually serve. Literally everything I attempted to order from my drink, appetizer, entree, and even my dessert ended up being something they don't actually serve even though it's listed on the menu. The food that I did get to try however was tasty and worth the fairly cheap price. Not a bad place to go but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"The first Filipino establishment I visited in Las Vegas.  Nothing particular stands out at this place. If you've been to a Filipino Restaurant/Karaoke place before, you'd find the same things here.   The food was ok...and the service was prompt. It was pretty dead for a Thursday night though."}
{"text":"The food has got to be the best filipino food I've had in Vegas!  Sisig dish is the best sisig anywhere, hands down!  So crispy and yummy! (i had to edit this and say the sisig is BANGIN'!!!) Ask for extra jalapenos.  Filipino breakfast dishes are so good, especially with garlic rice.    The atmosphere... well, I think the food and entertainment alone make up for it.  Fun laughs and fun times guaranteed!"}
{"text":"If you like ballroom dancing, then this is the best place for a party.  Had a party last week, great time, good food, lots of fun."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this but for some reason every time we come here service sucks so bad, it's like all the sever don't want to serve you at all, not even a friendly stuff"}
{"text":"Scale 1-10,I give them 1/2.Due to the special occasion from our 20th Anniversary celebration with early reservation we did,they made it double booked in one small place.I think they take advantage on us because all of us is from out of town.also unfair from the other group.And the food is not that good scale of 1-10,maybe 2.Another thing busy weekend,with party reservation, men's restroom broken.Its good I always bring my sanitizer in my pocket.The date 8-15-09."}
{"text":"While Cafe Moda isn't as popular as it used to be a couple years ago, it's still pretty full on the weekends.  The crowd is a on the older side and there are often parties set up there.  You can eat and drink first and then either karaoke or dance to whoever's singing.  The dance floor is a decent size and the dinner tables can be large enough for a good-sized group.  The restaurant/bar is located right at the Spring Mountain/Jones intersection across from the 168 grocery market.  There's plenty of parking available in the strip mall.  Since Moda isn't too far down Spring Mountain, oftentimes I'll just head down there after a night on the strip to get some sig sig and beer before heading home."}
{"text":"I took family members, visiting from out of town, to have dinner.  There was a party sitting close to our table, that started getting loud and boisterous.  All of a sudden, a drunk member of the party jumped up on our table, bare-footed, and started dancing around, stepping on our plates and utensils.  The staff did nothing!  I had to request the staff that we be moved to another table and have new serving plates, utensils, etc.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already and so far no disappointments. The atmosphere is always hype and the crowd along with the staff are awesome. I would strongly recommend this place to locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here and the food was good, service is the reason I  gave this place a 4 star. The lady server needs to be always reminded to refill our drinks. We are 25 in the party and I know it's hard to keep up but we were hoping they have more staff to help our server handle a big party. Anyway, the food is good especially the crispy pata. The kare2x oxtail meat is a little tough to eat but the peanut sauce was really tasty.  The lady DJ is very entertaining and she always try her best to make our party alive."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Went her with my husband and dissapointed. I heard the sig sig is to die for but the place has the personality of a wet mop. The filipino band is so unorganized, some black dude named Dan that he was hot singing Lou Rawls with the band. the band members look like they were from 1982. And how can you party and get down after eating sig sig and garlic rice???? 1: You stink and 2: you know all that dancing with the garlic rice and oily foods make you wanna tae!"}
{"text":"Visited this place last night I heard about their SISIG which is a famous Filipino appetizer or you can consider it as a dish. SISIG is famous in Bistros and other clubs in the Philippines. I opened YELP to check out the review about this place CAFE MODA the reviews that I read talks how great is this place and of course their famous SISIG.   It took me forever to find a parking spot which I did not mind because it's a Friday. Then when I was inside it took me forever for the waitress to take my order. Or even ask me what I want to drink. The waiter seems to be interested in attending their regular customers so said to my self maybe this is how things work in this place. And then finally after waiving to the waitresses like catching a cab someone came and took my order. So I ordered the SISIG when my order finally arrive I was kind Off dis  appointed because the SISIG is dry and the taste is not what I am expecting. Although I keep on tasting it trying to figure out why the taste is not good and dry.   And then finally I called the waitress so I ask her is this a chicken or pork SISIG. Since I ordered a pork SISIG the waitress said it's a pork SISIG. So I ask her why is it dry any way all I can say. If you are a regular in this place maybe you will say thumbs up. But for me this place sucks the service sucks.   And for all Filipinos here in Las Vegas try this place and hopefully I am wrong."}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas, and where does our group end up going?!  A freakin' Filipino \"disco\", \"just like the ones in the PI\" my friends told me...  ew.  Granted, it was fun for the first 2 hours, but the folks there don't get sick of dancing to the same rap songs being played over and over.  They serve food, although our group didn't have any.    The good:  No cover. The bad:  being in a filipino nightclub while in Vegas The ugly:  being here for more than 4 hours, nasty people practically having sex on the dancefloor, doing it to Flo Rida's \"Low\"."}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Moda to meet up a whole bunch of guy friends at about 2am on a Friday night.  Located off Spring St, a few miles from the strip.  The place was free, drinks were cheap (wait...did I pay for drinks?), girl was yacking in the stall next to me, LOADS of empty tables, good music which transitioned to BAD karaoking... all this adds to 2 measly stars.    It was a good conversation piece later, I must say."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, first time just to get a bite to eat and found they had karaoke there on a Wednesday night a couple of months ago.  I ordered the fish and chips which was not really memorable.  I ran into a friend that night and decided to hang out for a while.  I'm not sure what I did or who I look like that the KJ doesn't like but he was very curt to borderline rude each time I brought up a slip to sing.  The second time I came here I was dragged in by a friend and same KJ guy was there,  same attitude.  I put one song in and KJ was trying to do background singing over me.  Didn't ask....wasn't even friendly.  OK obviously it was me.  Paying for service and toking is not an issue but I'll be darned if I pay for bad service and then reward on top of that.  To the KJ guy, don't worry, I will never be back to bother you again."}
{"text":"As a customer I came to this place last Sunday  and purchase 2 drinks that costs 16.00 dollars and their customer service is very terrible not friendly and the cups weren't filled all the way to the top. So I tipped the bartender a dollar for their poor service it came to find out that they wrote a 2 over the 1 dollar I gave them to get more money out of a customer. What a rip off especially giving their customers poor service. PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine and dance!!! Very friendly staff and it's so much fun karaoke nights are just the best very nice place for your birthday parties or just hanging out with friends"}
{"text":"One of pretty good place to hang out with friends on Friday night! You can dance, sing on the stage and/or eat, drink on the side...while watch others 'being happy' on the stage :)  One full bar right after you enter this place, then stage in the middle and many tables around! Live is here on Friday (at least on Weekends I think so) ! I love their Filipino karaoke (even I couldn't understand at all), and they also have so many English songs (even issued many many years ago) !  Parking is hard to find because this plaza still has Korean karaoke and Chinese karaoke places + massage + one Chinese restaurant, which open very late...."}
{"text":"With no hostess at the door, we sat ourselves (its a bar too, so maybe its open seating, no ones around to tell us). About 10 minutes later a waitress took our order, and then shortly after we hear \"did you sit here yourselves? These are reserved. How many of there are you? No, these are reserved\" from another waitress, or possibly a manager, we're not even sure. I hardly ever Yelp, but this experience deserves a one star review  for the POOR customer service. There were a million other ways she couldve asked us to move, or at least a \"Wait here please until a table opens.\" For any Filipinos reading this...simply \"bastos.\""}
{"text":"Great little bar in a strip mall in the Heart of China town. Good food and great music. The waitress and staff were very friendly . This would be a great place for a large group."}
{"text":"I was here on Friday, 11/18/16 for the 2nd time with my friends for an early dinner before heading out to the airport.  When we walked in the restaurant there was a bad odor coming from the toilets behind the stage.  We told the server but she did not do anything about it. The restaurant did not look clean and it had a sewer odor inside.    I know this place is popular for the karaoke, DJ and food and I'm happy for that.  The Filipino people deserves a better and clean dining space and I know we the Filipino community can make it a better restaurant for our fellow Filipinos here in the Las Vegas.  I'm making this review to help the owners better serve the Filipino community."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere as an alternative to those huge overcrowded nightclubs. Perfect for locals without the fancy atmosphere. Food was. Or so great though. Ordered the quesadilla and was not impressed at all. If you want a place for the music and atmosphere, it is a good choice."}
{"text":"I like this place plain and simple.  I was dearly missing Philippines  and what better way to be reminded of my friends back home than coming here and chatting it up at the bar all the while enjoying a nice cold Red Horse.  Or two or three.  Bartender recommended the chicken wings.  Granted people come here for the pancet, sisig, and crispy pata all of which I've enjoyed in a group setting with friends and coworkers on previous outings.  Back to the wings, for the price you get a solid amount of wings.  I enjoyed the garlicky onion taste and made two meals out it.  So good. Even back home after reheating the leftovers I was still impressed with the taste.    There's a whole array of people that come here and that speaks volumes of how welcoming this place and the Filipino community is.  Black, Latino, White, Filipino (obvi), Pacific Islanders all gather here, making the mix eclectic for sure and everyone has fun.  I've learned this is the Filipino place to go as even other industry workers come here after their respective places close.  Have always had a solid time here and will keep coming back for that cold Red Horse :)"}
{"text":"My wife is filipino, we like to go to this place for the karaoke/music as well as the food...Overall, not to bad, similar to an old fashioned manilla nightclub you'd find in Philippines...The interior ceilings need repair, especially in the farthest corner to the right by a TV where water is dripping...The men's bathroom has the \"authentic\" tight nasty bathroom appearance with smell...I think this bathroom was picked up from Olonogopo from back in the 80's...Service is a PLUS with waitress's ready to go to work!"}
{"text":"My family came here for dinner and honestly, I don't what all the fuss about this place is all about.  I would be ashamed to call this Filipino food.    For starters, a soda cost $3, thinking that it come with refills.  Wrong!  The sisig was terrible and the kare kare sauce tasted like a VERY lightly flavored peanut water and just as thin!  The bulaklak was even worse!  So much fat on there it tasted like I was biting into bacon grease!  Rice wasn't included, either.  Overall, the food was very disappointing and very tasteless.  We left leaving most of the food on the plate.  It was that bad!  I have eaten REAL Filipino food in the province in the Philippines many times before.  I will NEVER be back to this tasteless, overly high priced restaurant ever again.  To those people who think that this place has great food, more power to you but this is not authentic Filipino food..."}
{"text":"It's a great place to come if you are craving sisig late at night.  Hands down I think they have the best sisig.  I believe you can order it in pork or chicken.  It's perfect with steamed rice and that alone hits the spot.  They have moderately priced drinks, and friendly enough servers.  I almost hesitated to give it three stars because I didn't like the ambience in there.  It feels small and  It's not for me but I would go back for the sisig."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Woman from cafe moda was rude, she made us leave because we did not make reservations. Did not give us an option to wait for a table or politely explained that they dont have tables available."}
{"text":"It's loud here. Don't come here thinking you can quietly eat and actually enjoy your meal. And hopefully you do not get the corner seat which consists of a coffee table and a sofa or folding chairs which is conveniently located behind the blasting speakers.  The food gets two extra bonus stars because it's good."}
{"text":"The main complaint first, then a review of everything else.  I attended the birthday party of a nice married couple at Cafe Moda.  They made reservations for up to 12, but for most of the evening, there was only 9 of us.  To seat us all, they had to move two tables for six side by side.  As the night wore on, a large group of people came in, and wanted to sit together.  The solution of the waitstaff was to move our group of 9 to the table of six.  Without telling us a thing, they began to move all the food down to one end of the table, then tried to have us shift down toward the end.  Well, if you can imagine it, some of us were still eating food, and would have to move our plates to where someone else was just eating...no cleaning the spot, nothing.  I don't know what the extra three people were supposed to do in this scenario, it wasn't explained.  Well, at the time I was raising hell about being moved from a table I was eating at because another group arrived and wanted my space, two more from our group arrived, and then we had 11 of the 12 slots filled.  They decided not to move us, but they did communicate to me, that because I was loud (having to complain over loud music, a normal tone of voice would not be heard) they thought of cashing us out and making me leave, at least.  I'm not sure if the intent was to completely ruin someones birthday or not.  Anyway, they made it clear that I was wrong.  Me. The customer.  The guy that was eating food at a table with my friends.  A guy that was ready to pay the bill for the food, table and service.  To their credit, they did not make me leave.  I was informed that they had to change waitresses because I raised a stink.  Clearly, the customer was quite wrong.  Now to review the rest.  The new waitress was capable and attentive.  The music for dancing was fine.  The place had good energy.  I had fun.  I've had the food on four prior occasions, and while I'm not an expert on Filipino food, I've had enough to know that it's the worst of what I have eaten.  Maybe, somewhere, there is a Filipino restaurant with worse tasting food.  When I find it, I'll let you know.  The portions are large, but so is the price.  A quick word about the sisig...I've eaten it, and it's dry and chewy.  That's not how it is served in the Phillipines.  I'm not quite sure what sisig the other reviewers have eaten, but this is just plain bad.  For the adventurous person not deterred by this review, feel free to eat here so long as you are flexible enough to move with your food to another table if someone else wants take your spot."}
{"text":"this is a very fun  bar located by China Town by Decatur and Spring Mtn    they offer great food, drinks and also have kareoke.  This llace is alot of fun"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Filipino food, by any means. So I'm glad that our server was very patient in explaining what was in each dish. And everything was yummy. Also, she recommended a simple, yet delicious, Blue Hawaiian (blue curacao and pineapple juice).   When we told her one of the people at our table was diabetic, she took the time to look for some low-carb healthy options that he could eat so that he could enjoy the evening as well. She even spoke to the chef and said they could make a special meal for him if necessary . That was going above and beyond for their customers.   The karaoke looked like a lot of fun, although I wasn't nearly intoxicated enough to get onstage :P  man, Filipinos do love some karaoke. After 11pm, though, it turns into a club! Although it is a bit of an older crowd compared to your typical Vegas club, it was so much fun. There were lights, smoke, and awesome music. From hip-hop, to alternative and reggaeton. I loved it. Definitely going back again... just drinking a little more next time. ;)"}
{"text":"Here for the first time and experience is awesome. DJs were great! Great selection of dance music. Karoeke singers sounded professional. Food was good. I'll definitely return and will recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Brief Overview: This is a cool little hole in the wall place that offers music, bar, and dance floor for most of your entertainment needs  Pros: - Pretty good dance floor to bust a move on (I got down with my bad self) ;-) - Great for large groups for parties and karaoke singing (DJ had a good selection of dance songs and oldie jams)  Cons: - It can be challenging to find a decent parking spot close to the cafe on a busy night - The food options are good if you like to eat, but more vegan, organic and/or NON-GMO options would be nice (it's a bar so I guess this to be expected)  Final Verdict: I went here for a birthday party for a friend and had a good time. I recommend it for groups looking for a fun place to karaoke sing and dance."}
{"text":"This Pinoy joint was mad fun. Not alot of these places in Seattle, so I had to just check this place out.   We were there on a night when there was a 70th birthday party going on. So that alone was entertainment enough. We sat at the bar and the bartender made good drinks. He made me a \"bartender's special\" which he says had like 5 types of alcohol. It was good and definitely not watered down. Although it tastes like a fruitified long island.   My other half was stoked that there was San Miguel. The sisig was good.  The lumpia on the other hand did not seem or taste real. It was like store bought ready to fry lumpia. What's up with that yo?   Other than the fake lumpia, this place was fun. Nothing classy about it ... but not too trashy. My friends who are Vegas locals however did warn us that one of their friends got shanked like 50 times ... so .... that kind of put us on some type of alert. We didn't stay too long. But good times nonetheless."}
{"text":"I m not filipino but I luv their sisig, it s so good and I want to say it s the best sisig in town"}
{"text":"My experienced here was not good because it happened twice already all i can say is Be careful in this place the waitresses here are  dishonest make sure to double check your bills after because they will charge you with some drinks that you didn't order especially if you have a large group thats what they're looking for they think its easy when everybody is already tipsy..bad management."}
{"text":"Came to this place with some friends and the host was demanding we order food while sitting at the bar because there is a requirement for sitting. Everyone was at least 45+. The quality and quantity of food was dreadful. The music sounds like a middle school wanna be gangster learned how to use itunes for the first time. DJ kept yelling in the microphone every 5 minutes. Worst experience at a bar EVER!"}
{"text":"Updated review: I came here to celebrate my bday with some friends and coworkers (who I trust, shame aint it? lol). I knew what I wanted to eat, Sisig! The food is delish. Ok, one would think with regular ol soda there would be refills right? Boy, was I wrong. Majoring in culinary arts, that's the one thing I learned in purchasing, sodas are the only thing that really dont hurt a business, everything else? yeah.  Of course I sang a few songs.   Negative: Small dessert section. Charging extra for refills. Oh if you go as a group and have your check split, Dont count on it.   I did have a good time at the place, but its rather frustrating to have an establishment not to bend a lil. I mean what are they, AZ when it comes to the new law?  anywho, I have yet to find a good karaoke asian place on the east side o town."}
{"text":"So if you want a great place to come hang out and have a great time with friends ... this is the spot. My husband, myself and friends love to go out eating, a little drinking and Karaoke. well actually my husband is the singer in the family. I like to get up and sing when I've had a few drinks in my system due to the fact I can't sing. But when you're tipsy you tend to think you can sing and that would be me.. The crowd in this place really don't care if you can't sing and will applaud you as if you're Whitney Houston! It's just an overall great place to come and have a great time at. Yours truly will be that drunken fool who is either singing like a rock star or dancing like a fool!"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and have a drank on, karaoke, Dj with  a dance floor. The staffs are awesome! The sig sig is out of this world"}
{"text":"CON: When we walked in, the greeting was lousy and we thought the place was closed. We were sat in a booth were the upholstery was torn and not taken care of at all. If you are going to run a restaurant, run one professionally. The whole family of the owners were at the bar and were loud. We are eating and all we can here is their conversation yelling back and forth. They also had a baby behind the bar area and they kept trying to entertain the baby all night long. This is not a daycare. The host/waitress of the other table wore shorts as if going to the beach. No uniforms at all. The cooks and our waiter were the only ones in uniform. The Bistek Tagalog I ordered was of poor meat quality and tough.   PRO: Huge place for parties and looks like a nice dance floor. Looks like Karaoke is there as well. The waiter was courteous and nice but that's about it.   Verdict: I will not be coming back. But if you do not care much about the food and want to entertain a large group, maybe bring them here."}
{"text":"Ok atmosphere ... Yeah it needs improvement! But who cares! The food is good here! Plus they got a couple cute workers and the vibe us chill; weather it be karaoke or a club night. For me I just go for the food! Hahaa!"}
{"text":"Awesome DJ & music, drinks are too. Packed dance floor, friendly staff. I have not tried their food yet, but heard it their food taste great."}
{"text":"What? $8 a shot and almost $15 for a drink?! This aint the strip!  Food is good, very Filipino. Actually, it is Filipino! I always get their sisig. Went here during lent and my religious friends couldn't eat pork. Damn it. So tried the chicken sisig instead, it's still delicious and tastes like pork!  2 stars because of the pricing...come on, I consider this place a dive bar. It ain't that classy! Service is aiiggghht. Drinks are aiiggghht.   Still, 2 stars. Don't get stabbed in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Best sisig ever! It's my guilty pleasure. Soooo bad for you, but soooo good! So who cares?!  The bartender is on top of it & super friendly. Love all the staff here.   I love coming here on ballroom night. Which is Thursday's, I think. It's nice watching everyone having a good time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the vibe was very positive but we had a lot of problems. We reserved for a big family but they were also having a party event that was more prioritized than ours. We were served food very late and we couldnt even eat till 10mins past that because we were not given silverware until later on. We understand that they are busy but they shouldnt reserve a party when they have an event going on which filled 90% of the restaurant. The place also smelled unpleasant which we had to get used to. I doubt ill come back."}
{"text":"Ended my early birthday party here at Cafe Moda since we were shooting pool right nearby couple doors down. I never been here before but went too few of the restaurant in this little shopping mall and always thought from the name of more coffee shop. BOY talk about farther from the truth! It more like club at night. They do serve food but really here too dance the rest of the night away or look at other people getting their grove on. My first impression was I know not no strip club so not expect all the glamour or high tech stuff. They still have dg that was playing all the current catchy songs too some old ones. The place is pretty dark dark and if looking too meet someone good luck, You need night vision goggles too find them. Since low ceiling the place can get fairly loud so conversations need too shout in the ear. (really is it that much difference then club on the strip?). The drinks price I thought was fair but too be honest not much of club club person. I believe they take song requests and certain nights they have karaoke most nights?? The dance floor is actually decent size for the small location. Once it gets packed really hard too find table area so want hang out all night best too get there early. Cafe Moda definitely has its own personality and if looking too mix things up get away from the strip club or the cover charge Cafe Moda great choice. I would go get my grove on here again."}
{"text":"For such a small place, they really pack in the fun and entertainment. Every time I've been here it's been a blow the top of the building type of night. The music is on point. The food is delicious. And the drinks are non stop. Every one gets along and it's a great vibe. Lots of fun people and the host is always so sweet. I really enjoy but I do suggest coming in a group, and come early because seats fill up fast. Safe and secure. Fun and entertaining. Food and drink. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Cafe Moda is the most fun place to sing, dance, laugh, drink and eat the best Sisig and yes, extra Jalapenos please! Crispy Pata is as delicious as it should be with a crisp at each bite! The lumpia's are pretty good, garlic fried rice is tasty and as Filipino as it can get and the sinigang is delectable!  This place is also a Filipino Karaoke bar folks, so be prepared to be in a very loud, entertaining venue and with the Nanay's and Tatay's doing the cha-cha and bringing sexy back! You never know, you might just catch a drunken girl trying to do a stage dive into the dance floor after singing or screaming her heart out!!   And here is a big tip....don't let the little Filipino guys or girls intimidate you if you are not Filipino and walking in alone. Yes, Filipinos do stare but mostly because they want to eat you! Just kidding....we stare because we want to know what you are wearing, so smile back and if the stares don't go away....offer them a drink and they just might be your best companion or compadre for life!  :-)"}
{"text":"FUN FUN FUN!!!!  The first time I went to Cafe Moda, I lost my ID somewhere on the strip (which is probably a common thing)... so I didn't get to go in :(  Looked so much fun though!!  This is the second time I went to Cafe Moda and this time I had an ID!!!! There wasn't too many people there which was nice, but the music was so lively and our waitress was kick ass (only to find out she was a great singer!!!!)    There was 5 of us in our group and we ordered: sinangag rice, steam rice, sinigang, sisig, and Crispy Pata.  The food was delicious!!!! I loved the fact the sinigang had so much vegetables in it!!!! soooo yummy!    I felt like I was in my own family party and my aunties are off doing the electric slide on the dance floor.  It was a great home away from home kinda scene.    Guests can request to sing songs and get to go up on the stage and others can choose to sit at their tables and hang out or dance!!!!  Great company, great environment, great overall... Thanks Cafe Moda!!! (definitely brought the singer out in my friend whom I never realized can sing a tagalog song..)"}
{"text":"The service and food are mediocre at best. Waitress unfriendly and unwilling to provide good service BUT had no problem adding service charges. Save your $$."}
{"text":"Very bad service! Very bad food!  Dumbness waitresses I've elver encountered!  Double check your bill before you pay coz they'll charge extra for something that you didn't order."}
{"text":"This used to be my #1 favorite spot to go to for oxtail soup and sisig.    Unfortunately if you are \"round eye\" you're going to not get good service or actually be waited on at all.   Tonight my daughter and I came in. We were seated by a guy who threw down one menu on the table and acted like we were inconveniencing him to seat a party of two.   15 min later.  No drinks, no server, three other tables were seated after us and they all got waters and menus.    Sorry moda but all paying customers even if not big parties are good customers.  It sad because you have the best sisig in town. We have come here on and off for over 10 years but time and time again we are made to feel like we don't belong here so we won't be returning ever again."}
{"text":"WHO: I have seen people of all ages come into this spot, so EVERYONE IS WELCOME!  WHY: the sole reason I always keep going back is their amazing PORK SISIG!! It is definitely ON POINT!  WHAT: first thing's first.... This place is definitely a good time!! Every single time I decide to have my sisig, FUN seems to come and join, lol.  Since it is open so late, I tend to always end up there at night. I still haven't been there during the day, but I believe it just a regular restaurant during the day, but a restaurant slash party at night.  There is either karaoke night and or a dj playing some good music, and everyone dancing on the dance floor.   It's a good place to bring your friends for some good Filipino food!! The food I have gotten to try (explaining these will now be the challenge): PORK SISIG- this is crispy pork with vinegar and a lemony zesty goodness aka MY FAVORITE TOKWAT BABOY- this is also crispy pork with tofu, and vinegar soup, so good with white rice! LOMI LOMI- thick rice noodles with a creamy soup and veggies  I still have to try a few more food when I do crave Filipino food, and also if my mama doesn't cook it, so hopefully I try something else next time.... Hopefully!!! :)"}
{"text":"Ok....came here for my hubby's high school reunion and the person in charge of coordinating rented the place out for a few hours. As soon as we entered I was punched in my nose with a smell of a toilet that smelled of crap! This entire restaurant smelled like a rotten sewage and it made me too nervous to eat anything! The health department should come and inspect them to make sure they plumbing isn't backed up and overflowing in places it shouldn't be. This place just didn't look clean and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Just  had a party with Cafe Moda  for 44 people .I was told beforehand  that since I had only 44  people  there will be  other walk in customers  coming in while the party is ongoing. I booked the party from 5PM to 9  PM since I was told that  other people usually comes in after 9PM. What I did not know  is that they booked another party from 7pm . I paid  for the DJ from 5PM-9PM .Guess what , people from the 2 parties are dancing  on the floor ,It is disappointing  to see other people dancing in your party. No More next time for Cafe Moda."}
{"text":"This place is a club that serve dine ins as well where their sisig is just to die for."}
{"text":"This place is divey, okay for people who dance and do karaoke, AND for groups.  Regulars come here, strangers are not made to feel welcome.  I used to come here for the food before the place was turned into some sort of a dance club.  A Customer Appreciation Party was posted on Facebook today with a free buffet only from 8-10pm.  I had a guest and took him there to savor the food and experience the dj entertainment.  We got there at 8.  We ordered fruit juices (non-drinkers) and waited for the buffet for 45 minutes.  After they assured us the food was coming out, we waited for a few more minutes.  It was obvious the free buffet was a ploy to get new people in, make them wait so they would order drinks which were at club prices.  We were totally ignored by our server, never even came back to ask if we wanted anything else.  I guess they appreciate only regular customers at this place and not new customers who may turn out to be regulars in the future.  This place turned out to be an embarrassment!   Hey, Chinatown is not that far, and that was where we ended up.  If people go to Cafe Moda only to dance and sing, and do not order food, it is probably because the food is no good even when they're free.  We did not stay to find out and we are not coming back, ever!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to verify that the sisig was as good as everybody claimed it to be. I gotta say that they were spot on.   Me and the wifey came on a Thursday night at about 9:15. First thing I noticed as we walked in was the blaring music they were playing and people that were dancing ballroom style. For a second I thought we went in through the wrong door because outside it wasn't marked clearly.   Once we were greeted by the hostess and was led to our table, we weren't too sure if we should eat there or take our food to go. Since we really didn't want to wait til we got home to eat, we decided to tolerate the club style ambiance and ordered it for there. Im kind of glad we stayed because what happened next was really something you cant forget.  We ordered Pork Sisig and Tokwat Baboy. As we were waiting for our order, we were watching all the peeps that were on the dance floor do their thing. Now I wasn't sure if this was a typical Thursday night because upon looking further, we noticed the crowd was a mix of young and old folks. The DJ was playing a mix of fast moving songs from the 60's to today. Didn't matter what he played, everybody on the dance floor did their thing. What really caught my eye was when they played \"Gangnam Style\". I kid you not I swear I saw at least 2 old ladies that could have been my grandma doing the dance like they were Psy themselves! Wow. Dinner and a show!  So we finally get our food. If you refer to my pics, these two dishes alone could have fed at least 4 people so we knew we were gonna have leftovers for the next day which wasn't a bad thing. Of course we had steamed rice to go along with it so if you think we were gonna eat it just by itself than you are so wrong.  Service was mediocre. Our server came by every so often to check up on us but it seemed like forever in between those times.  The food itself was definitely worth it just going there. Only thing is, I think its a bit pricey. The Sisig was 13 bucks and the Tokwat Baboy was 11 bucks. At some other Filipino places, it was definitely cheaper.  So in my opinion, if you don't mind the loud, blaring music and the out of tune karaoke singers, then eating here should be ok for you. Otherwise, call ahead and get your food to go."}
{"text":"are you looking for sisig and crispy pata?  if yes, i have to tell you that this place is as good as it gets in vegas.  you gotta try them!  it's soooooooooooooo delicious here at café moda.  i promise you won't regret it.  note:  they are only open for dinner!"}
{"text":"I just came back from studying from the PI and it felt like I was back in manila when we went to cafe moda. People singing karaoke and feel of the place brought me back to my college days in manila. As for the food, I personally have had better but the food was still good. The large serving size and the prices are fair. Cafe moda is a great place to experience the Philippines in Nevada."}
{"text":"We came for a birthday party and got there before anyone, so decided to order food after a half hour of waiting for the so called waitress we finally got service. Half hiur after that we got our food. Mot before my boyfriend had to walk to the bar to get our drinks.  Our friends arrived and were told prior we would have two tables which never happened, when asked the waitress said she did know what to do and would   I dont know if this is a normal occurance on saturday night but to only have one chef and bartender/ waitress on a busy night is a nono. Get more qualified staff or dont stay open late."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here just out of needing something to snack on. She mentioned Cafe Moda had some very good salt and pepper wings. So we took a drive to get some. On arrival, there were a lot of people in and out of the establishment which was good. It indicated that there is something good going on here. Well, walked in and realized it was a Filipino establishment which caught me off guard. I figured I was in for a treat because there is a lot to rave about when it comes to Filipino food. Then again I was only there to snack on some wings. Upon arrival, we sat ourselves at a booth overlooking the dance floor and watched everyone dancing and having a great time. It was a mixed crowd as far as the age goes and everyone was friendly, randomly saying hi and smiling. And that's kind of where the pleasantries ended. The staff was very cold. The waitress took our order of calimari and salt and pepper wings. The salt and pepper wings are to die for and the calimari was cooked perfect. The only problem was the customer service. I had to flag the waitress down as she was sitting at the bar. Asked her for another drink and she kept reiterating to me that there were \"no free refills\", like i didn't hear her the first time or as if i couldn't afford another cup of sprite. Not sure what that was about. I'm not sure what was going on with the staff but I will give this place another chance in the future. Only because my friend said that The service was good last time she was here. 2 Stars is for the overall customer experience. Sometimes the food can't save bad service."}
{"text":"So Cafe Moda is a tiny little club on Jones and DI off the strip.  The place is kinda crammed with very little wiggle room because of the dance floor and restaurant tables taking up most of the space.  The food features all types of Filipino fare all night long.   The DJ was good and the place was your typical Saturday night crowd in Vegas..... Only reason for a non-five star was the pricy menu.  Other than that Cafe Moda is a great late-night spot."}
{"text":"best karaoke sound system in town!  Sunday through Thursdays are great days to go if you like to sing. Friday and Saturday of you like to dance. they have a club like feel and good people here that work."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, the staff was extremely rude, couldn't even ask for a pitcher of water without an eye roll. NEVER going back!!"}
{"text":"Food....excellent  Ambiance....excellent  Music / singers .... almost excellent   Drink prices....higher than a giraffes ass."}
{"text":"Visited on June 23, 2017. Went with a party of six during the evening.  Atmosphere: Dead, unless you do something about it. The interior of the restaurant is dark but is given another dimension of sensory stimulation with the loud music from the bar and the karaoke from the main dining room. My party and I decided to participate in karaoke, which made things on our personal ends a little more fun. Other than that, the decor and lack of lighting did not make it feel more welcoming.  Service: Not bad The server did her job. We got food in a timely manner, our drinks were refilled when they needed to be, we got more food when we asked. The server was nice, but no true memorable qualities or moments were created that evening.  Food: Authentic! Growing up with Filipino food, the food was pretty legitimate! All the flavors were on point and at a fair value, too!  Summary: Aight If you are willing to get a taste of Filipino food and don't mind an non-responsive environment, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I was taken here a couple of weeks ago and then I was here again last night but what an experience.  This place is a restaurant and dance club in one. The music is a mix up of old and new school and the food is Filipino themed.  I honestly felt like I was in another country and I think that's just because the clientele is mostly Pacific Islanders.  Although on both occasions I've only been here a moment, I know that I did enjoy myself here with my good friends. We danced, ate, and drank and danced some more.  If you're that person and want to try a new experience of food and dancing, you may want to consider entering the world of Cafe Moda and be transcended to a different experience!  :)"}
{"text":"We ended at this place my first night in a recent Vegas trip. Obviously my local friend was the one who knew about it. All I gotta say is craaazzy man. It's a great feeling to stuff yourself full of rice and sisig after a night full of drinking at the club. Food was good, and drinks were cheap. The crowd is majority of Filipino people from young and old. Plus mix in a few black and mexican heads.   Moda is a Kareoke bar first and foremost, but they do play hiphop inbetween sets and people usually get down on the dancefloor. It's a great place if you're looking to shock your filipino friends with something new hahah!  Oh yea watch out for the uncle who wants to be your best friend and the guy who tries to dance with ladies in his dress shoe and white socks =X!"}
{"text":"Food - i was not happy with the food.   Pancit was very salty, crispy pata arrived cold and skin was not crispy, lumpia shanghai was nothing to write about.   All 3 items that we ordered where not delicious; although you cant go wrong on rice.  Karaoke - was great...Journey - Steve Perry - Unfaithfully was awesome!   Thanks Sam!  Dancing - was okay...a lot of line dancing.  Overall, 2 Stars - the food was not up to par but the entertainment was awesome."}
{"text":"We were here with a big group of high school friends for our reunion. Instead of having fun you guys made us lose our appetite. We paid good money and we expected to continue on with the  \"Nice euphoric feeling\" you get when you see old classmates and friends. For starters the buffet style food was not that good and when we asked for the drinks that should come with the buffet , one of your waitress told us the soda fountain was already closed. Then at about 10 pm, some of the people in our group were asked to vacate the tables for newcomers. That made us very upset since that was very rude and we were still enjoying the evening. When we complained to the manager instead of acting like a diplomatic listener, she was acting combative. Couple of years ago, like dejavu the same treatment was accorded us but this time it was my UST college classmates. Profit is not the only thing but treating your customers right. Maybe you should consider renaming your place Cafe walang modo!"}
{"text":"Went here strictly for the sizzling sisig, and it did not dissapoint! However, I was not into the atmosphere. I guess on the weekends it turns into a Filipino disco disco complete with a DJ that mixes songs together without letting them play all the way (so Pinoy). It was dark as hell in there, so I could barely see what I was eating. But you know what, that damn hot, sizzling, citrus pork dish made it all worth it."}
{"text":"For a Cheap fun night we come here.  Drinks are cheap and filipino food is delish.  Random: SUSHI! Filipino food and sushi is kind of good you know!  The DJ, is ok but the karaoke is funny.  It's fun to watch Filipinos (I'm filipino myself) sing Karaoke.  They just make it entertaining.  They always feel like it's the stage of American Idol when in reality they had one too many drinks and one plate too many sisig.  But this is a must stop for me!"}
{"text":"My first time here last saturday for my birthday weekend my friends took me. Had a amazing time ! Good music , food , drinks and Service ! Will def come again ! Im from California and glad i Went. Thanks café moda!"}
{"text":"OK, I've been going to different spots and trying their lechon kawali, chicharon bulaklak, and their sinigang na baboy. Cafe Moda is always on point with these three favorite items of mine. The kawali and bulaklak was freaken amazing! Perfect every time! There is nothing left on the plate whenever we get these niblets of heaven. The last time we ate here, for some reason the sinigang was the best sinigang I've ever had. The chef made it a tad bit more sour than usual and we all looked at each other. Their was nothing left in the bowl when the waiter took the bowl away.   Quality Filipino food here yallz. I'm never disappointed whenever I have a cheat day from the gym."}
{"text":"Despite the rave reviews about the sisig, I don't think I'll ever make a trip back here. The overall \"ambiance\" (if you can call it that) is not very inviting, in my opinion. It's dark, with minimal decor, and \"party\" style tables. The \"bouncer\" there was just chillin' at the bar, and the bartender was just as inattentive to any potential customers coming through the door.  I went on a weekday at about 8 in the evening? The only people in there was a group that consisted of about 4 older Filipino men, I'd say around... hmm mid 30s to early 40s, and a bunch of young girls... somewhere around their 20s? Them,  and a middle aged couple.   Anyways, I was having a good time with my 2 girlfriends, singing karaoke and such. I was stoked because I actually got the couple to slow dance when I sang \"Crazy\" by Patsy Cline. My friend Amber sang a Britney Spears jam, just so I wasn't hogging the mic... well, I was up there for the 3rd time, since uh, there was no one else in there, and our other friend, Maria didn't want to sing, then SUDDENLY, as I was approaching the last lines of \"I Will Survive\" by Gloria Gaynor the \"DJ\" cuts my song off, and decides to introduce one of the girls sitting with the Filipino Mafia, or whatever, saying she has a CD coming out.   Really? Well, whatever... Perfect timing. Just when Amber was about to tip the DJ he cut me off.. NO MORE! Not since he pulled that stunt.   So I sat down with my friends, and we attempted to listen to this girl's supposed skills on the mic, and I have to say, I'm not the best singer, but I was definitely better than her.   I'm giving this place one star, NOT ONLY for the horrible DJ, but for the horrible service, and UNDER SERVICED restrooms, not to mention the uncaring workers."}
{"text":"I was duped!!!! Lack of karaoke. DJ talks too much. If I wanted to go to a club, I'd have gone to one. The food is the saving grace."}
{"text":"There is only one reason to go to Cafe Moda and that reason is the sisig. I haven't been to Cafe Moda to experience the nightlife. I figure if I want to hear some really bad singing I could go to any Filipino party where they have a Magic Mic.   The decor definitely needs updating... when you walk in, it's like you're stepping back into the 80's. There's a dance floor and a stage in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant is rented out sometimes for private parties but they still welcome other patrons even though there is another function going on. The first time I went here, there was a huge family reunion and they were showing videos and a slideshow of that family. It felt like we were party crashers but we made the best of the situation.  I usually order Kare Kare and sisig... both are really good and keep me coming back. If you want to avoid bad karaoke, go when they open, around 5 pm."}
{"text":"Not coming back here anymore we ordered a bunch of food and Diet Coke which the glass twice as small as the water glass asked for a refill and they said there's no refill talk to the manager which the bartender her name Leilani she was the one that pour that soda which was mainly all ice . She said no refill and it cost $3 for a Diet Coke rip off place . Cede de Cebu is much better ."}
{"text":"Stop #3 of our Chinatown Crawl...  Café Moda, I upgraded you, but not by much...I still don't see how people are able to eat/conversate while the music is blasting away.....  It was hilarious seeing a couple of fellow Yelpers(names withheld) get down on the dance floor, and didn't even notice us tucked away in the corner  LOL! Better music selection with more current hits and I hope they got rid of Electric Slide...I surely doubt it though!  ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant/Karaoke/Dance Club in one? Fun Filipino atmosphere where the old folks and young kids can all hang out and have a good time. The place was kind of dingy with dimmed lights and loud music. The dining tables were wrapped around the small dance floor and the only kind of light that was provided were from the candles, disco ball, and the big TV screen that was on stage where the karaoke mics were.   As for dinner, I gotta give it to them and say that it was quite tasty. I was satisfied with everything that was ordered and pretty much licked the plate clean - totally murdered it. We ordered:  Tosilog (pork with fried rice and fried egg) - $9.95 Sisig (shredded pork w/ onions n' mushrooms on a sizzling plate) - $12.95 Sizzling Black Pepper Chicken - $10.95 Garlic Fried Rice $7.95  Service: I thought was okay, not friendly at all, our waitress was kind of stuck-up'ish. We ordered water to start off with and she came back with six bottles of the small 0.5L Arrowhead Bottle water which were at $3 a pop - that's $18 for just water! (This is the kind of water that I can get for 50¢ at 7-Eleven). We flagged her down and told her we wanted tap water (the free kind that comes in a glass), but she told us they didn't serve tap water - which didn't make ANY sense because \"later\" on that night I saw people at the next table over with tap water! And on top of that, I too was able to get water from a different waitress so that totally pissed me off!!!  Note: She quickly gave us our checks before we were even done eating and told us we had to pay because she had to clock out. The rude part was when she came back with our cards and waited for us to sign the checks and see how much we were going to tip her. The next thing you know, she was changed into her hoochie-mama outfit and was on stage doing karaoke! (I guess someone was in a hurry to go sing)."}
{"text":"Went here for a party. They already had all the tables set up with plates and water. I don't really like that. From my entrance intro the building, I already had mediocre opinions on this place. Tap water was disgusting! I don't recommend drinking it at all. I don't even think lemons could save this one! Had to drink soda instead because I didn't want any alcoholic drinks. Food was okay. Karaoke was loud, but people seemed to be enjoying it. Bathrooms were not that great - with the foot traffic, they should at least flush adequately. Nope...  Don't think that I'll return anytime."}
{"text":"Never fails. We come for food and end up dancing the night away. Hahah And this time we even had the balls to sing some karaoke!  LOVE. THIS. PLACE!"}
{"text":"I thought their price was really good and bar foods were actually very good. Mostly Asian and Hispanics here.  But no smoking inside so air is clean and actually fun to hang out with friends and do karaoke. They will play dance music in between karaoke so you can dance as well. Over all experience was very good. Something different."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We went there dinner and karaoke last night and our waitress only had 2 other tables to wait on and she is unprofessional and unattended. She took our and never came back to check on us. She left out our food order and didn't even bother to fix it. When we had more people to join our party, she rolled her eyes at our table and didn't even want to serve us. We had to end up getting our drinks at the bar. From what she told us, she's been working there for 10 years and she's 43 years old with long hair.   Place is so run down. It looks like a crack house. The food isn't good either! Please don't waste your timing going here!"}
{"text":"The worst Bar ever! Asked the bartender for another Cosmo due to the 1st one was watwres down.  Bartender didn't give usbrhe time of day, statwed that ahe put rhw alcohol base was more then enough, we brought the the drink back almoat half full as well. VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, most establishments just simply give you another drink, not this ridiculous place! WORST BAR EVER!  there were about 25 of us for a college reunion, you think that they would juat clnsidwr2one simple request? NOT THIS STUPID EATABLISHMENT!   I REPEAT, THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  MANAGER COULDN'T EVEN BE FOUND, FAIL!"}
{"text":"I would never get tired of going to Cafe Moda. It's always fun to be there. DJ was rockin last Saturday. We danced until we dropped. Always a great crowd, great ambiance and employees are very friendly. Highly recommended for locals who wants to party and of course for out of state people. It's a place that will never be under rated."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times with large parties. My first impression wasn't very good, tried it a second time, again not very good.   The DJ is the best thing about this place. Fun karaoke, good line dancing, good dance floor and tunes. And that's where anything good about this place stops. Comes to a screeching halt.  The food is okay. I have tried several things and wasn't overly impressed by anything. It was edible and that's about as good as it gets. I did enjoy the fried banana the first time I went but it had lingering tastes of French fries and fish so I know the oil needed to be changed.   Drinks. This is a bar but every potent potable I have ordered is either barely drinkable or ghastly. This past time I had a shot of Fireball, that was great you can't mess that up.  Then I had a mango mojito. I thought with a mojito you muddle the mint not chop it up in a blender with your drink. If you are going to offer it, don't be lazy make it correctly. My drink was frothy, and chunky, very unpleasant. It tasted vaguely of mango.  I couldn't finish it since I was picking SALAD out of my mouth from drinking it. I decided to try a grasshopper here. Hands down WORST drink I have ever had. And I've had a lot drinks in my time and This isn't my first grasshopper. It tasted like mint was in it but I have no idea what else was in there but it was absolutely nonpalatable.   The service. I can't decide which is worse, the drinks or the service. Maybe more servers are needed? Maybe better trained servers to handle large parties? I never knew who my server was because she came around so few times. I was just randomly ordering from anyone who looked like they worked there.   One server said she wasn't my server but yet she was at my table??? Do they have sections? My food took so long I got to the point where I was HANGRY and nearly left. To wait that long for mediocre food is unacceptable. Then the owner? Head hostess? An Asian lady with tattoos on her arms, a nasty attitude and a smart looking blazer who has the air of some kind of authority figure asked me if I was with a party. Yes.  Our party had two tables. A lot of our party was up dancing and socializing at the other table. She asked me if more people were coming. Why, would I know? Can't you see I am eating? We have two tables, we can't all fit at one.  Was she planning on asking the three of us to move and to where? (There were many open booths, it's not like the place was so full they didn't have space and after 10pm my understanding is there are no reservations...its first come first serve.) Not very friendly. I don't understand what the point of her questions were. How is everything may have been a more poignant question. Well, actually not very good, but she probably knows that so doesn't ask.  No one asks!   I am not going back there. I will spend my time and money somewhere else on better food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"Came here only cos I was my dad and uncles DD. I wasn't expecting such a live joint. The food is good, I ordered the tosilog. I recommend it. Pretty upbeat vibe. The Dj knows how to get the old folks off their seat."}
{"text":"sisig and sinigang was good but the service sucks and they have NO refills...i know it's a Filipino bar but seriously this is NOT the damn Philippines! quit being CHEAP!"}
{"text":"Not too far from the Vegas strip, live entertainment, down home Filipino soul food... and open late at night! Aside from going to family or cooking myself, I wouldn't go anywhere else in Las Vegas to satisfy my late night cravings for adobo, sisig, sinigang, crispy pata AND karaoke!"}
{"text":"We went with a large group and ordered a bunch of food for 16 people. The food was overpriced and super salty - probably full of MSG. On top of that they charge per soda !!! (No refills - and they only have Coke/Diet Coke & Sprite).  Neither did they accomodate us with our request for upbeat music - our group were the only people in the place.  We will not be back, that's for sure.  Positives: The calamari is super-yummy and we still had a good time as a group"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say...I came for the food and ended up staying for the pure entertainment of watching Lola's on the dance floor... Gentlemen- if you have that Asian persuasion thing going then you might want to check this place out..  It's true what everyone says- it's really dark in there, I had to use my cell phone light to see what I was eating half the time.  It was pretty empty when we arrived at 9pm on a Weds night, even though it was their 7th Anniversary celebration.  We sat down and ordered just as they were starting up the Karaoke session.    We ordered: Ox Tail soup- pretty bland but vegetables and ox tail was good Kare Kare- a stew with ox tail and peanut butter and veggies...sounds kinda gross but was actually pretty good, it comes with a shrimp paste you can add to the sauce to give it more flavor. Mike Bihon- rice vermicelli noodles and thicker udon like noodles stir fried with vegetables, it was okay Sisig- fried finely chopped pork bits/parts brought out on a sizzling plate.  This one was pure awesomeness if you like that sort of thing. You squeeze lemon on it and eat with rice and its a good night...  Well- the karaoke started and I just about threw up my food..not from the food itself but more of the shrieking and how loud and bad some of the singers are...geez...thank god karaoke was ending at 11pm that night..there was not going to be enough shots for me to be able to deal with that all night long...I mean, it was funny laughing at some of these people but some were up there like they were all auditioning for American Idol!  Once the dancing started, that's when things really took off!! They play a combo of hip hop, R & B, house, trance, techno...it was hilarious watching people of all ages out on the dance floor and the get-ups of some of these folks...  Next time, I'm bringing my friends from SF here!  The food was good and the entertainment was even better! I will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool Kareoki/Nightclub Filipino joint where they serve the best Sisig I've ever tasted. Their sisig is not your typical sisig made out of chopped-up pork head but it's made from crunchy pieces of fried pork meat and skin, mixed with onions and their special sauce, served in a sizzling hot plate.   Went here at 2am on a Saturday night and this place was packed.  Waited for a few minutes to get a table but they have a full bar while you wait.  Good place to grab a late night snack and have a few drinks while people watching with your friends.  We even noticed a few white guys and some bruthas hanging out in search of their next Filipina GF or wife..haha.  Place opens till 5am so I was pretty surprised to see a lot of \"uncles\" and \"aunties\" here partying that late! Crazy!"}
{"text":"If karaoke, dancing, Filipino food, drinks, and great company is what you're looking for then this is a great option for you! Located on Jones right off of W. Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown part of Las Vegas.   I've been here a handful of times (both for a functions and just as a drop in to get a drink after dinner) and every time they've been super busy with some kind of party. So normally I have to sit at the bar since most if not all the tables are taken up. Come early if you want a table.   The employees here are a hit or miss as far as friendliness is concerned. If you don't buy drinks or food, they pretty much ignore you, but if you get something, they are always there asking if you want a refill. I don't normally come here for more than just one or two drinks unless I'm here for a party as their drinks seem a bit high for off the strip and their drinks aren't all that strong (mixed drinks like Rum and Coke).  The food that I've had here has been delicious!! I definitely suggest trying the Sisig, Kare Kare, BBQ Skewers, Adobo chicken, Tapsilog, Bihon and Canton noodles, and Calamari. All of these dishes I've tried and have been satisfied with them.   This place is casual, but most of the ladies that come here like to dress up, but they guys are usually just with jeans and a nice top. I don't even think they have a dress code. Every time I've been here, even really late at night, there have been children here, so it's not what I'd consider a nightclub, but they do have a dance floor where you can get out and shake your thing if you want too. It has a family-friendly feel..just like when us Filipinos have our parties at our houses.   This place is really small, so expect it to get very crowded during the weekend and late nights. Parking is also kind of tricky if you don't come early. I've had to park across the street on several occasions and walk over since the parking lot is very limited and it is shared with all the business in the shopping center."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!?! this place is the Shit! After Tao we were hungry so our friend (local) suggested Cafe Moda. The Sisig makes my mouth water as i type this..that good! I was blown away by the music selection. By far one of the best DJ set for Late 90's-2010's. The crowd is mixed (young and old) but everyone got along. No drama. Drinks and food were affordable and staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Great food! Pricey but good.... Fun to watch the people sing. I don't go up and sing so I give them credit lol"}
{"text":"my wife n I usually arrive around 6pm, we sit in our usual booth greeted by Cesar, at 6pm its fairly quiet with a few people at the bar. Every time we eat here we order the Diniguan n the Bulalo Soup automatically w/o hesitation or thinking abt it, so fn good!!!!! the food comes out fresh n hot in a timely manner n not to mention the healthy portions they serve ( i'm abt 5'11\" 250 lbs) I can eat!! so the food is always on point, friendly staff, outstanding service ( THANX again Cesar ) theres nothing negative I can say abt Café Moda 5 STARS across the board"}
{"text":"3am and I can't believe I'm still out and about because I'm an OLD LADY!!!!! (Syke) wow. This place is still jumpin. That's because Filipinos know how to THROW DOWN!!!!   I got a cum shot shot. Dirrrrty yes I know. But a cum shot is just Bailey's & Tuaca. And it was yummy. Basically tastes just like a B52. Man so many dirrrrty, filthy jokes can be swarming right now lol.   Anyway i told my friend to order the chicken adobo because it was one of the \"safer\" filipino delicacies to try and let me tell you....this tastes soooo damn GOOD!!!! Just like Mom's!!!!! But of course my mom'a chicken adobo is the bestest!!!!"}
{"text":"visiting from NY/NJ. came here after club hakkasan with some of my cousin's friends. cafe moda is definitely NOT a cafe. it's a bar & restaurant. i saw on the menu that their sisig is the best so I ordered it. everybody else ordered pancit canton, more sisig, & salt and pepper wings. The sisig was not good to me. it was extra hard and flavor wasn't on point. i'll stick to my sisig in ny and nj. pancit canton was really really good. their salt & pepper wings is crack! especially with the ranch sauce it comes with. the table behind us  came after us, had the same amount of ppl as we did, we ordered way before them and they got their orders before us. smdh"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, not by choice, and I have not ever left this place happy. It's a late night hang out with karaoke, food and alcohol... You always expect, any place that has a karaoke machine, will have people who think they can sing or people that are so drunk that they think they sound awesome. I'd never return if it weren't for the people that we hang out with, I'd NEVER return here. My most recent visit was last night and here's the play by play...   Right when you walk in, it smells like rotten eggs. There's is usually someone there, bouncer type person, usually LARGE and in charge. From watching the rumors, I've heard that they've had to to hire more security due to the \"Fights\" that break out there-- GHETTO. Then you're walked over to your table, keep in mind that the place is so dark. I get it, there's a dance floor and you want the lighting so low to hide the fugly-ness of your patrons but c'mon... You have a bunch of drunktards roaming around in this cramped restaurant, give the place some light!   We were greeted by this grumpy, older Pilipino lady dressed in the most casual of clothes. She took our orders and brought over our food and that's it. Soo the services sucks booty.   So, to deal with the music, karaoke and the dumb drunk people that go there, I drown myself in alcohol, which makes me visit the restrooms more times than I'd like. EVERY TIME I GO HERE, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE RESTROOMS. The first time I went there, there was water all over the floor, which I believe was from the toilets, ew! On my next visit, the toilet was broken and they didn't put a sign on the door to tell you \"HEY! Don't pee in here... Or crap, cos it ain't goin to go where it needs to go!\" This last time that I was there, the locks fricking didn't work in the stalls so I accidentally walked in on someone and then someone almost walked in on me, luckily I was holding the bottom of the door closed so, sorry, no free shows!   Ok, the FOOD. I miss pilipino food, being from San Diego, there is a plethora of this cuisine to choose from. There aren't many selections here in the desert so I was SO disappointed in their food and the fact that good Pilipino food is hard to come by out here. I had the Tapsilog... First of all the rice had no taste... It had the look and smell of fried rice but it was in no way close to tasting like fried rice. The tapa looked like it was burnt to a crisp and-- you know how meat looks like if you fry it for too long? Yep, that's what it looked like, gross and inedible. I was hungry and a little buzzed so I ate it anyway. It tasted like day old meat that they flash fried to pass off as fresh. It was horrible. And, my companions had the Tosilog... And ended up throwing up and having the runs.   The next time that I receive an invite to go to this establishment, I am going to give them a BS excuse or flat out \"HELL NO\".   Gross, gross food."}
{"text":"If I can give this place zero star I would.   Me and a group of friends went here last night for some drinks. We ordered a shareable cocktail but wasn't happy with the taste. There was little to no alcohol in the drink, so we brought it back to the bar to kindly ask for more. When we asked the server for more, a woman named LEILANI claiming to be the manager, confronted us in the most outrageous, disrespectful manner.   Obviously pissed off at us, she told us she was the one who made the drink and there was enough alcohol in it. She yelled at us to bring the drink back and to WATCH her pour how much alcohol she puts in it. Who does that? What kind of customer service is that? Another friend with us that night happened to be a bartender as well at a different bar. After watching her pour the alcohol, like she asked, he advised that was not enough alcohol for the shareable drink we ordered.   This is the worst customer service we have encountered here. We made a reservation for a birthday party here but we decided to cancel after this experience. The owner needs to reevaluate their employees, because they reflect the restaurant as a whole."}
{"text":"Went here with the gf not really knowing what to expect. Had some food and I can say, it's really good. There were an array of karaoke singers doing it up on the mic, the drinks were good and not too pricey. Fun place to go and have a little fun, a few drinks, sing it up, and eat some delicious Filipino food."}
{"text":"The sisig was top notch...also had the combo fried rice--not too shabby. I could do without the extra bass from the speakers and bad dancers tho--I wouldn't go there again at 4am...probably during the day so I can fully enjoy my meal"}
{"text":"Had such an amazing night at cafe moda we was a family of six and  Emily was able to get us a table right away right next to the dance floor which was perfect for us and she was our server and her customer service was fantastic plus she was very friendly and extremely nice and cool very easily to talk to couldn't have asked for a better server she was able to take down our order at a fast paste and got all of our orders correct and she was able to get us our drinks and food out at a very fast paste not only that but she was serving other people as well which is perfectly fine that shows that she was able to multi task which is amazing plus she kept on checking up on us which a lot of servers usually don't do nowadays this is very highly recommend to go to and if you do go ask for Emily becuz she is just fabulous as a person and at doing her job!!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars just for their SISIG! Nothing compares. I was visiting my bff in Vegas in November and we were suppose to go to Body English.I forgot my ID at her house so went back to Henderson to get it and kinda pooped so decided to go to Cafe Moda instead. My bff had been here before and said they had a dj. It was a Sunday night...so they actually didn't have a DJ that night. It was pretty empty (it was around midnight). They did have kareoke. I wasn't even hungry. All we ordered was the sisig because she told me how good it was. It was delish. I ate so much even though I already had dinner. We shared one plate and even had left overs that we ate the next day for lunch. Going to Vegas this weekend and Cafe Moda and their delish sisig is on my must-do-list and it will be every time I go to Vegas. Service was pretty good. And um...the kareoke music was horrible. lulz. But I'm not much of a kareoke kinda gal."}
{"text":"This is a fun little hidden gem in Chinatown, yes we have a Chinatown in Las Vegas! They have both types of  Karaoke good and really, really, really awful. I only had apps but the chicken wings were very good. So I say stop in have several drinks and Karaoke your little heart out! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Leilani is not a model leader, she is bias treating some customer (racist ). Importantly  She doesn't know how to manage this Place. She is suck in customer service specially the commotion last nite ( she did not control the crowd  ) soon? So the people afraid and left.and also the septic gas smell are still lingering around the dj booth coming from the bathroom."}
{"text":"Hang here! Mama Lu will take care of you!  A friend and I came here based on a recommendation from a co-worker last Thursday night. I was a little hesitant to come, since parking at this plaza is usually a nightmare. We found a spot right across from Cafe Moda and walked in. There was a bouncer at the door, no cover, and maybe only 8 people in the entire place. The place is a restaurant by day and a karaoke dance floor/bar at night. Despite the small crowd, I had a blast watching the drunk regulars singing their hearts out on the karaoke machine. We chatted it up with the manager and she told us that everyone calls her Mama Lu. She brought us some Sisig to try with our drinks and it was delicious. She introduced us to the other regular customers and the servers and really made us feel at home. I've decided to make this my friendly neighborhood bar!   A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"Seriously a hidden gem for late night foodies wanting some Filipino comfort food, with an added bonus as it is a \"club\" atmosphere on selected nights with a live DJ spinning Top 40 & EDM! Great environment, a little too loud though; but overall, it's pretty dope + add that Filipino hospitality! This place seriously has a mixed crowd, both young & old, and it has a \"Filipino Party\" atmosphere. Highly recommend this place! If you're coming from the Strip, drive west on Spring Mountain Road & make a right on S. Jones Blvd. - and voila, Cafe Moda is on your right! Come hungry, leave happy! :)"}
{"text":"Im pretty sure everyone knows at least one Filipino that comes here to party/eat authentic filipino food.. and if you dont, you must not have friends. :)  Ive been here for from attending sweet 16's to karaoke nights for some drinks and dancing, thus ive never been disappointed with their service. Some people think its ghetto but i think they are doing right. Theirs lots of booths and tables plus a full bar for all the loners like me. :D  The DJ here has been spinning for as long as i can remember and plays all the good vibe music as well as the new hits that make the crowd get up off their asses. (Wobble baby!)  Drink prices are well.. lets just say they are cheaper than going to a casino nightclub.   I can see this business expanding in the near future with all the locals and regulars i constantly see stop by."}
{"text":"Don't go here to eat, just go to get your Filipino dance and karaoke on, I guess.   I had a $20 certificate (glad I didn't actually spend good money here). Ordered (to go) the waitress' suggestion: egg roll appy and Mike (noodle/bok choy/noodle something). Both were so SOOO greasy that I took a few bites and trashed the rest. Yet another disappointing Vegas dining experience. Also seemed like waitress had never seen the menu before. Amateur hour.   Pass.  BTW, I was tempted by the sisig until I learned it is traditionally made with pig ears and snout (wat?!). Waitress said theirs is made with pork belly. Yeah, I trust her? Pttht."}
{"text":"it was once a good place to go after a hard's week of work. since new manager took ( think her name is lani) it's not fun any more. she is extremely rude and they over charge. bathroom are crappy and plays same song every time i go. food is so and so ok. think twice when you go there. bring extra cash for hidden charges like so called service charge."}
{"text":"Woo Hoo! Came here the other night for a going away party for a Filipino coworker and had a great time. Lots of Beer, Sake, Karaoke and lovely women! We ordered some Combination Fried Rice, Lumpia and Sisig (Hella Tasty). Fun times watching coworkers sing, especially if they are good and the ones that are bad. LOL"}
{"text":"HAHAHAHAHA omg I'm super stoked this place already exists here on Yelp Veg-ass. A very biased 5 stars because I've known the bartender and the weekend DJ for many years now, but still...one cannot deny the invigoratingly predictable what-the-hells always taking place at Moda. From the occasional \"toughies\" pushing each other around on the rocks right outside the door to the regular guy in the shades who ALWAYS warms up the karaoke mic by murdering \"Higher\" (sew lets godder/less make are esscaaay/sew lets godder/izz sasha mistaaaake!) and the number of people who avert their eyes and vehemently DENY that they were there one particular evening when I bring it up at a future meeting (come on, nothing shameful about having the \"sisig stache,\" it's ok, no one's hating and it's dark)....Moda's been a fixture for people craving an edgier spot to enjoy some drinks with their pancit malabon. They once kicked me out for stripping during a particularly emo-tional rendition of Heart's \"Alone.\"  I'm kidding. But it could happen."}
{"text":"For many years my wife and I would frequent Cafe Moda with many of our friends when it was under different management. The new manager, Leilani (the owner's girlfriend) is the rudest person I have met, with zero customer service skills. She is disrespectful, demeaning, obnoxious, just plain nasty. She thought she could be a smart alec with me until she found out I went up one side of her and down the other. After ordering bottle service we were allowed two mixers. So we go through the mixers only to find out she wants to charge us for all mixer refills. Correct me if I'm wrong but when you go to a club and get \"bottle service\" the price of the mixers are included. Not at Cafe Moda. It would have been nice to know this prior to opening the bottle. Needless to say I told them to take the opened bottle back. That's just the beginning. My guests didn't have napkins. We didn't have enough plates or place settings. The waitress was not clearing plates. Not everyone had drinks (not even water). I was bussing the tables and waiting on my own guests. This place is a joke. We were there for my birthday and it felt like I was having a bad dream. We had more people show up than expected and Leilani was not interested in accommodating us. She couldn't care less to have our business. I had to make a decision. I took my group of 30 people over to Bropards across the street and had a blast!!! The manager, Tara, was happy to take our business (and it was big business for a party of 30). Actually Tara used to be the manager of Cafe Moda during the good days, which is why we USED to love to go to Cafe Moda. Not anymore. If you want to be treated like family go see Tara at Bropards. If you want to be treated like a criminal go see Leilani at Cafe Moda. Last night was the last time we will ever step foot in Cafe Moda. And all 30 of my guests share the same feeling. Great job Leilani!!! And to the owner (Bill Carney), I know Leilani is your girlfriend, but she's going to end up destroying your business. Just read the yelp reviews about her. They aren't good!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here when I told her I wanted some sisig - a Filipino delicacy that is somewhat hard to find. She said they have a good version of it here, and also because she wanted to show me how the place is like one of the beer gardens we have in the Philippines. First impression, it's a little bit on the divey side. It was pretty quiet at around 6:30 on a Thursday night. But we were told it's ballroom dancing night, so I got a little excited about that.  We ordered our food - sisig, grilled squid, tokwat baboy, and lots of rice. The sisig was definitely a different version than what I've been used to. Instead of the chopped, salad type texture, it was dry and crunchy. Like chopped pork rinds, instead of the usual pork ears and cheeks. It was still good, albeit not what I was expecting. The tokwa't baboy tasted like paksiw. Too vinegar-y. The tokwa (tofu) better than the pork belly (gasp!). The grilled squid was good, but nothing special.  Because it's ballroom dancing night, we were immediately approached by a few DIs (dance instructor). They're the resident dance partners who are there to teach the newcomers or just dance with the regulars. In return, you can buy them drinks, and/or tip them at the end of the night. For the record, we did neither, as a matter of principle, ha! We weren't there for that long. We danced a few times (cha-cha, salsa, swing, boogie). It was a lot of fun. The DIs know what they're doing. The place started to fill up with more patrons and based on their dance moves, we could tell they were regulars. I wish we have something like this in Reno. It reminds me of home. A little cheeky, but always a great time!"}
{"text":"First things first . stay away. Food and drink services is horrendous. The door and customer service is so poor that I would rather have none at all. The atmosphere deals 1970s do your own. I've heard great things about this place and I put them at a level that they could not even attempt to touch. Stay away and do not come."}
{"text":"went here to celebrate a friend's 40th birthday on the last day of 2010! they had a table of filipino food goodness including a whole roasted pig (lechon)! the restaurant was equipped with a sound system, dj booth, a large dance floor and a full bar! it's a nice place tucked in chinatown of las vegas. nevertheless, i heard the sisig was good here but never had the chance to try it this time around."}
{"text":"This was my go-to place for Filipino food in Vegas. Most of the food is cooked well and very tasty.  My only issue is the customer service and the owner(manager?).   I called Friday afternoon to see if it was possible to make a last minute reservation for the day. Instead of simply saying no, I got a \"It's already 7:00! How many people and what time?\". When I told the manager 9:30 she said \"Oh no the last reservation I take is at 8. After that first come first serve and GOOD LUCK because we're very busy\". Her whole attitude telling me all this rubbed me the wrong way. How ugly.  Well we decided to go anyway because it's always fun and the food is good. But guess what... when we arrived at 9:45, the place was DEAD. It did pick up later but it just pissed me off because of our whole conversation.   Still debating if we'd come back.  (Edit) I just remembered that maybe 2 weeks before the above incident, we were seated at the corner back table. One of our friends moved her chair which unintentionally pulled the lamp's plug. It was too tight of a squeeze for her to fix it. Later, the manager/owner came and had us plug it back in, which isnt a problem at all. BUT she also accused us of hiding alcohol under the table. She even checked.  Come on now, we are regulars at this eatablishment AND we had buckets of beer on our table. This kind of treatment makes me question the worthiness of Cafe Moda. Food's great, entertainment's great, but management can suck it."}
{"text":"So for fun karoke and flavor of food and decent location I'm giving this place a 4 out of 5 because I had some issues with our server but the manager is really friendly and ended up helping me out in a situation that wasn't even mine to get help with I just asked how to spell her name and my server sent me to her to find out lol and the server went ahead and told her I guess either way  Noni is really nice .karoke is fun but if you have a big group or attending saturdays to do it be sure to make reservations ...     This was my first time attending Cafe Moda but it was on a invite from a group I'm in on Facebook. When I first arrived I ordered a soda from our waitress Crystal but she didn't offer me a menu and my soda was all I ended up with . Some of the people who arrived before me had ordered food at which time I requested a menu from the busser . Later on we had more and more people coming and someone from the group was told we could move tables but Crystal stated the manager Noni (her name I think is spelled that way but it's so hard to hear in there ) would not let us have the table but I could talk to her if I wanted ... At that point I had not asked my servers name but I hate that sort of reply where you pass it on to your manager acting helpless or offering a solution ... I asked how to spell her managers name mainly because I couldn't hear and I always ask names for my reviews .. I don't know what crystals deal  was or if she was unhappy with the fact people had requested separate checks  I don't really know .. I'm mainly salty because I would of liked more than one soda and I definitely would of enjoyed some food but maybe next time I can come back and update to 5 stars .  The manager saved the rating by making sure our group was able to get moved to a table and she was really great about explaining the problem which could of been told to my entire group by our waitress and it would of made everyone's lives easier but thankfully the manager understood what the dilemma was and also explained it was our organizers fault about why we were not all allowed to sit together so in turn we got moved to a large table just lost our waitress ... which meant I didn't really get to sample a lot of goodies but I got a few photos of the food folks at my table got .."}
{"text":"Crispy pork belly is the bomb!!! Grilled squid was tasty. I enjoyed the late night kitchen and I love the karaoke scene. This is a place I would bring my friends to."}
{"text":"I was just happy to find out there was a place in Vegas where i can eat tosilog. I didn't know what i was walking into after we left the club to go eat, i was expecting a little restaurant but ended up walking into another club that just served food still. Food was really good and and the drinks weren't that pricey. I didn't see any karaoke singing but the music sure was loud. This will have to be the new after club breakfast spot from now on."}
{"text":"For the takeout I had picked up a few days ago I can say I was not pleased. The rice was burnt to crisp, the pork was fatty with little to no meat, and the soup tasted rotten. I must explore the different Filipino food options here in Las Vegas, but this restaurant is definitely not the place to go. The interior is really ghetto and out of date as well. The lady who helped me was really rude and there was a 15 minute delay when picking up my items."}
{"text":"Whenever I step foot in this place, it's like I'm in the Philippines.... It's interesting.  I've been here a few times to grab a drink and maybe dance a little.  It's funny that you can get some sisig and two feet away there are people getting down on the dance floor.  The drinks are slightly overpriced in my opinion.  But the resident DJ actually plays some pretty good hits... mixed in with a little bit of electric slide and its bound to be a good time (for like 20 minutes, then I'm done).  The crowd is also bit on the older side.  However, if you're looking for a non-pretentious place to just have a quick drink and dance to some good music (especially if your Filipino), this is an OK place to go."}
{"text":"I give them 5-stars because they have an all-night kitchen, they're open late, the waitresses are friendly, though a bit pricey the food portions are huge, the liquor/beers are reasonably priced, the dance floor is spacious & well-laid out, often they have a DJ though sometimes someone's singing karaoke (which I loathe) and even on weeknights it can get festive whereas the rest of Chinatown is dead."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is pure entertainment. For some reason thinking about this place makes me laugh. There's dancing, drinking, karaoke, and Filipino food here. This is the perfect place to be fobulous.   Dancing here is like a never ending Filipino wedding reception \"open dancing\" if you will. Complete with various line dancing and hits from 80s, 90s, and today. Whatever the DJ feels like will get the crowd dancing. Slight annoyance, cool it on the JLO. \"Waiting for tonight\" is not really danceable. It's funny watching the older generation do \"watch me whip, watch me nae nae\" ... So gangsta! Lol.  It is so loud in there you can barely have a conversation with someone across from you. I guess that really pushes you to do less talking and more action. Get your booty on that dance floor!   I can't recall a drink menu, but I would imagine they would have some fruity, island cocktails. Stick with the basics: whiskey/ginger ale and cranberry vodka. Kind of boring, but they can't really mess those up. Drink prices were okay.   Food. Everyone and their momma comes to Cafe Moda for the sisig. It's pretty good here. I don't normally order sisig at other places and I don't eat Filipino food outside of home, so no comparison. I can't say it's the best, but it is comfort food and definitely hits the spot when one is craving the sour, salty, spicy concoction of crunchy, chewy pig parts.   Not much to say about their karaoke, since I didn't participate. It was nice to hear some good voices up there though.   Service can be spotty, but I think it was hard to get the waitresses attention due to the loud noise. Otherwise food came out within a reasonable amount of time.   Late nights and hungry bellies either mean the usual rotation of Cafe Moda, pho, oxtail soup, or steak and eggs. Foreal though!  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 15/100"}
{"text":"Writing a review on this very day after experiencing the infamous Cafe Moda I heard so much about just hours before on a Friday night.  It was my first time and reason of my presence there, it was the meeting point my friend Will suggested before heading out.    Being filipino it just seemed natural to at least try this place once since it's so popular with my race.  Came here at about midnight and the moment I stepped in I felt like i was back in the army stationed in South Korea haha.  So much ladies of the filipino ethnicity being escorted by old white males. I thought the beer prices would match the interior of this place but I was wrong.  Still $4.50 which I thought was still too high for a place that looked like this.  While waiting, I also decided to order something to eat.  Just wanted to kill time while waiting for my buddies. Ordered a calimari.......not that good and the sauce that came with it was some type of vinegar that made my breath funky.  So bad that even the fresh off  the boat ladies didn't wanna talk to me.  I would recommend this place to the older asian generation and any looking to find and older partner to leave with it.  BTW, I joke around half of the time so I apologize if I offended anyone by the fresh of the boat description of this place.  I'm fresh of the boat too, from the Titanic tour of Luxor I experienced with the yelp crew."}
{"text":"You ever found a place that felt like Cheers?  Well, that's what this place is to me.  CafeModa-eers!  Every time I walk in I'm greeted with friendly bouncers, servers, and bartenders who have all become more than acquaintances.  It got to the point where I was there every day just to hang out.  I had graduated to being a local drunk of Vegas and had a favorite bartender, Angel.  I just can't get enough of this place.  I've had to pull myself away from here just because I started forgetting about everything else.  It was a place to escape all realities.    Luckily, they decided to be smoke free, it smells so much better and you still come out smelling like the way you came in unless you've danced the night away and just sweated all over the place.  Not like before when smoking was permitted, I hated the way I smelled after coming out.  The music is a mixture of r&b, rap, and some dance music.  Ordering food is easy as I pretty much like everything they have to offer like the sisig, garlic fried rice, tapsilog, and losilog.  Food is served till late so you can even go to the clubs first and then go to Cafe Moda to eat after.  The best days and times to go if you're looking for dancing and a good atmosphere with young people are Ladie's Nights on Wednesdays/Thursday mornings, Friday nights, and Saturday nights.  But, any other night if you're feeling up to singing, \"Like a Virgin\" it's all a great night for it.  I've had my fair share of Selena's, \"Dreaming of you\" after some Jack and Cuervo."}
{"text":"Late Night Bar Food of it's finest, but the last time I was there around 3am my food was cold, but I still love the place as my friends work there."}

But, FINALLY, I got to try the infamous sisig that my (once local) BFF raves about....and it did not disappoint.  YUM!  The hot, crunchy sisig here is the bomb.com....and that's sober!  I can only imagine after a night of drunken dancing.  It can get a little salty after awhile, but that comes with the filipino deep-fried food territory.  The lechon kwali is also delish and packs a crunch, which I'm all about!    All in all, this place is great for food.  It also is/turns into a club for dancing and hosts karaoke...super random, but I can see how it would be a spot for locals or anyone who is over the strip.  Sketchy area, but I will def be back...for food and maybe a song if I ever choose to come here over drai's one night..."}
{"text":"It took us a while to find something we could eat to order. A half an hour after our order was finally taken our server came to tell us that what we had ordered was unavailable!!!  I was furious but convinced to stay.  What we eventually had was OK and priced OK.  The Karakoe-ers weren't bad but the dance floor was too sticky to spin.  We'll go back if invited but won't on our own."}
{"text":"This place is comically bizarre. The more drinks, the more comedic it all becomes.  I've been a couple times with my coworkers, as they like to dance and drink after work. They get off late, so it's a decent casual venue. The crowd is middle aged.  We once ordered food. The only thing memorable was some fried chicken wings. I'll admit that I don't know much about Filipino food though, so whatever else made it to the table was lost.  The servers can seem a little lost as well.  It's one of those places where if you're buzzed, with good people, and everyone's dancing, then sure, it can be fun. I would never go here otherwise..."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip to Vegas with a group of friends. We had just arrived in Vegas and were hungry. The boys suggested Cafe Moda since they went there the last time and raved about the sisig. So we took cabs to Cafe Moda, which is off the strip. When we got there, there were groups of people outside the door. Inside, we waited to be seated. There was a nice fire at the front and considering how cold it was outside, it was nice to stand in front of it. We were seated withing 2 minutes. It was super dark inside and I couldn't really see other people but there were lots. People were dancing on the dance floor and the DJ was pretty good!  We ordered drinks for each of us (have to if you're in Vegas) and the 2 plates of chicken wings, 2 plates of sisig, and 1 plate of fried rice. My drink was really strong (jack and coke) so it's good to know they didn't skimp on the alcohol. Our food came but they only gave us 1 sisig. We didn't mind though because we got full off the rest of food. Every dish we had was excellent and we polished everything off quickly. We definitely left very satisfied. Didn't stay for any dancing though because we were tired.  The next night, we ended up at Cafe Moda again because we were all hungry at 2am after going to a club. Ordered wonton soup, chicken wings, more sisig, and regular steamed rice. The wonton soup was really flavorful and I thought it was one of the best wonton soups I've ever had. Hmm Filipino wonton soup better than any Chinese wonton soup I've ever had?... yes even though I'm Chinese, I had to admit it. It was damn good! The sisig had too much onion this time because every bite I took had an onion taste... didn't enjoy it as much.  Overall, can't wait to come back to Cafe Moda for the food. It's a small little club too but I wouldn't come here just to dance."}
{"text":"My half-Filipino-ness loves deep-fried pork goodness from this place such as crispy pata and sisig.  Last Friday, my big sis was craving for some sisig.  I've been to Cafe Moda before and have experienced how loud this place gets at night so I suggested we call in a to-go order.  After trying to talk my sister out of eating here, we ended up eating at the bar since the tables were blocked off for a kid's birthay party (yeah, a kid's birthday party on a Friday night).    As predicted, the place was obnoxiously loud.  The dj had a thick Filipino accent and was saying stuff like \"happy bird day (happy birthday with a Filipino accent)...you guys wanna dance IN the dance PLOR?\"    *CRINGE!!!*  The food couldn't come soon enough!  Then the dj started urging people to do karaoke!  OH HELL NO!  The server/bar tender was too busy trying to flirt with every guy there and flipping her hair.  This place is stright up tacky! If I didn't love my sister, I wouldn't have eaten here.  But I'm sure she learned her lesson: call for a to-go order!  But then again, their sisig is the best!  The crispy pata is excellent here too."}
{"text":"This place looks a bit shady at first but wait until you get to try their food! Everything that we ordered is do delish! So far this is the best filipino restaurant for me in Vegas!"}
{"text":"To all filipino food lovers. Do not go to cafe moda. First, the food is too salty and they don't give you enough. My friend had a birthday party here last night and it was the worst birthday she had. The server ROCKY was very rude and unprofessional, she yelled at the 51 year old birthday girl and threatened her.  She changed their agreement because she thought she could make more money. When we asked for the manager there wasn't one.  So to all those people planning parties there get your money back and go somewhere else. You'll have a better time @ Dennys."}
{"text":"Here with friends, DJ is good and has a deep selection of songs to choose from for Karaoke and dance. The food is ok but the service is not even ok. Cannot order a drink because half the time the bartender is missing."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is straight up AWESOME! Whether you're here just to sing karaoke or to come here after the club for late night filipino eats!!   UGH you know its gonna hit the spot after the club! Every time I come here it's always a good time. My mom and her friends always come here and they will usually play clubbing music after karaoke so you can get up on the dance floor for some dancing.  DRINKS: Drinks are cheap and the aunties know how to pour them up!! I've also ordered the huge punch bowl and that was really good. I tend to just order my usual vodka tonic drinks.  FOOD: Don't even get me started with this! I don't know if it's because I'm drunk/tipsy or because I barely eat Filipino but it always hits the spot for me.  ADOBO SINIGANG SISIG BEEF STEAK  All the basic Filipino dishes are legit!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to Cafe Moda, I was a little skeptical of going in based on the looks of this strip mall. For some reason, this place was poppin'! It was a Night Club, Restaurant, and Karaoke Bar in one! The DJ was pretty good (and I'm picky with my DJ's). They have a pretty good sound system. Karaoke, well, it's open to everyone and not everyone can sing. Best thing about this place: SISIG!!!"}
{"text":"We heard so much about this place that we wanted to check it out before a show that night.  What I really like about this place is that the staff is really friendly and very accomodating.  There was some kind of event going on Saturday night and the restaurant was hosting a private event.  The host said that they could squeeze us in.  The put out a table for us and found some extra chairs to fit 6 people in the corner.  I liked that they didn't want to turn away business.  Sisig-pork belly was awesome and so was the sinigang."}
{"text":"Great place to continue the night after a party with drunk friends, especially on the weekends. I always order their bulalo soap"}
{"text":"Reminded me of my mother and grandmother. Filipino reunion for the win! I love courgars!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service is subpar at best. Leilani who claimed to be the owner... was the worst which is a reflection of the lack of customer service. Why go here when there's a place with the same product but  better customer service two doors down?"}
{"text":"\"You guys wanna go to this place that serves sisig until 4am??\"  It was precisely what me & my friends wanted to hear on a Friday night/Saturday morning after being at Vanity nightclub.   Whaaatt?? Sisig? This late at night? Good lawwd.... Yes, pls.   It's on the corner of Spring Mountain & Jones a little bit past Chinatown. It's not the most attractive place from the outside but I could care less. The food was great, the service was good and the music was dope. We were tripping out the whole night on where we were, what we were eating and what we were listening to.  This isn't a family restaurant. It's 21 & over... More like Bayanihan in Los Angeles back in the 1990s. Our friend who's a local in LV now, brought us to Cafe Moda and we're so glad he did. We were seated at a big table near the small dance floor. Yes, dance floor... complete with fog machine and cheesy disco lights. Awesome!   Not too long after we were seated, they brought our table bottles of Red Horse beer and San Miguel beer. Hahaha... Our local friend was familiar with the menu and we let him order everything. My mouth is watering a little bit thinking back on the late night meal we had there... We had sisig which was delicious, served on a sizzling plate and we liberally squeezed calamansi on it to top it off. Yup, mouth still watering... We also had lechon kawali which was cooked perfectly and had the requisite Mang Tomas sauce on the side. I would've been good with multiple orders of those 2 pork dishes but more hits were coming.... We also had calamari, pansit bihon, kare-kare, a whole fried bangus (milkfish), lumpia, etc... All the food was delicious. Granted, anything late that night should taste good but if my still-salivating mouth as i type this is any indication of how tasty our dishes were... well, that should be proof enough.  The music was great. They were playing hip hop and r&b classics. It was a live DJ and he definitely kept the dance floor busy. We arrived around 2am, i think, so I'm guessing there were even more people earlier that night. I heard everything from Wu-Tang, Lauryn Hill, Naughty By Nature, SWV, etc.. So many hits from the golden era of hip hop... And to end the night with their last dance they played Jodeci's Come & Talk To Me remix.... WOW. This is what clubs need to do. Play some damn Jodeci at the end of the night. Everyone would leave the spot so damn happy.... no fighting. Strictly on lovemaking missions. HAHAHA....  Cafe Moda might be too hood for some people especially if you're used to eating on the strip or were expecting a Goldilocks type atmosphere. The place is loud, it's dark, the fog machine is out of control... But the music is on point & the food hits the spot.  Be back to Cafe Moda next time we're in town. Lookin forward to it... Mouth is watering, once again."}
{"text":"LOL!   Come here for late night, pretty tasty authentic Filipino food and if you want to be hit on by the creepy uncles that are old enough to be your grandfathers while the aunties mad dog you while wearing their Cucci, Prava and Louise Booton handbags. It's reminiscent of Lourdes' in National City and Tita's II in Paradise Valley so if those are your jams, you'll feel right at home, Uncle Boboy.   Parking is terrible, similar to Convoy parking in cramped tiny lots. Interior of the bar is more attractive in the dark, dingy and old but serving it's purpose nonetheless. Service was ok and if you're hankering of for a cold San Miguel beer and artery-clogging delicious fried everything, this is your spot.   Music is loud which can be a plus or minus for some folks but the classic jams will take you back to your 80s and 90s heydays. There was a dude singing his heart out on karaoke, possibly auditioning to be the replacement for Journey's frontman. He was pretty good actually, can't lie about that.   Cons: cover charge but nothing outlandish. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"I'm not Filipino, but it didn't matter, went with some colleagues as a 'completed training' celebration.  They ate, I got their too late, but what was left looked REALLY good.  The music was great, but being from NYC (we're not big on Kareoke) it was a little strange and it died out A LOT once the singing started.  Everyone was very nice, even go to dance some salsa!!!  Anyway, had a great time regardless.  Would go back."}
{"text":"So I was in Las Vegas for business.  Yes. Business.  No, I'm serious. Business, you heathens.  Aiight and a LITTLE BIT of pleasure. I mean c'monnn son! It's VEGAS.  So I'm eased in! Cool. Like I am. Chillin'. (Lol RIP Bernie Mac). Just came out the Mark Curry show, which was MAD hilarious! But I really wanted to touch base with my local fam in the Sin. So I tagged the cousin, and she says to meet her at Moda, where another relation of ours works the door. Awww snap! FAMILY DISCOUNT! hahahaha.  So I get in and it's like...being back at Serramonte Mall. HAHAHA! HELLLA Filipino folks! I mean, there were a few other spots of colors here and there, but Manilla was in the building! LOL (hey, I love my PI people! Manny #1! haha).  The floor was packed with some maddd fly females and the occasional dude who has NO CLUE as to what dance to do when the music starts up. I almost was about to call the medics for this one Asian dude who started this weird jerking, body-stuttering motion. I wasn't sure if homeboy was feelin the groove or having a seizure. But tell me why homeboy had like 3 of the baddest ladies dancing around him!? HAHAH! So I wasn't mad though..well not that much lol.  There was this one cute female though who kinda creep'd me out though because no one wanted to dance with her. So she decided to play Go-Fish and just dance AROUND dudes and hope one would turn around and hit their Dougie on her. That was a negative. LOL! This one cat was hittin the Cat Daddy and she got behind him and started mimic'n his movements..but HORRIBLY OFF. She kept trynna edge around so he'd see her and they'd dance, and this foo just rotated the same direction to avoid eye contact. HAHAHAH!! Priceless!  Cousin then ordered hella food! Some beef sigsig, garlic rice, and pork adobo. I didn't eat so I can't comment on the food. But it smelled deiricious! (I know what I typed)  But overall, the place was mad chill. No drama popped off like it usually does at spots around the Bay (I mean, not that I know of. I don't really do the nightcrawler bid. LOL Seriously!) The staff was coo..the only problem was the DJ. He was WHACCCK!! And he kept hoppin on the mic to talk over the music. Wadda doooofus. LOL. So I dropped a star. But still, if you're Filipino or even from Daly City/South City and you're visitin Vegas, this is a decent local spot away that'll make you feel at home and it away from the strip and good for easing into ya evening till the wee AM hours.  Done!"}
{"text":"Cafe Moda is a Filipino Karaoke bar. They serve a variety of Filipino food as well as their own alcohol concoctions. If you order alcohol, insist on ordering a regular drink (i.e. Vodka tonic, Gin and Tonic, etc.) and not their mixes unless you enjoy fruity drinks that are extremely sweet. Although their names for their drinks are interesting such as the \"Piece of Ass\" which consists of Amaretto, Southern Comfort, and Sweet and Sour Mix, the mix itself is too sweet for my palette.  Cafe Moda is located in a really busy Asian shopping center. Parking is really scarce during peak hours so you may have to park really far away from this place. This was the case when we arrived in the evening.  The setup of this restaurant/bar was interesting. It is essentially one big open space with tables setup surrounding a dance floor and a stage. The people who are sitting at the tables brazenly gaze at the brave soul singing their heart out. I was expecting separate private rooms for karaoke like Korean karaoke places but alas, this place is not like that at all.  Our table ordered a variety of Filipino dishes. I don't know what the names of the dishes were, but the Filipino dishes tasted decent. However, I ordered ceviche (a Latin delicacy) and was quite disappointed. Lime juice is supposed to cook the ceviche but instead, the shrimp was actually boiled in water! Stick with the Filipino dishes as they obviously do not know how to make ceviche.   There was a live MC that entertained the karaoke and music portion of the entertainment. Initially, there is ambient music in the background playing the latest dance hits from the club, and suddenly, it transitions into someone's karaoke selection. This pattern continues back and forth. If no one wants to sing, the MC will gladly sing a song to fill the void. In addition, the MC frequently sang duet with other singers too which I though was interesting. I liked that the MC was participating and keeping the party alive.   After a while, the MC lead the group into dancing the electric slide. It was really odd. The only time I have done the electric slide was various company functions. Hence, if you grew up on the electric slide, you would enjoy this. The patrons mostly consisted of Filipinos who love to sing karaoke."}
{"text":"We just wanted to eat dinner. They have a new dress code policy. But why??! They turned away 15 of us.  Not goin here anymore. Now we found #DISTRICTONE. BETTER FOOD AND ATMOSPHERE! Rip  cafe Moda!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service was terrible. The server had an attitude problem and she wasn't welcoming at all. I will not come back here at all. if you're around the area, go to some other restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible! 1 the service is just horrible, our waiter practically ignored us all night with our drinks empty and we had to ask her multiple times to get refills. 2 we ordered our food and it took forever to come out. I mean like 40 min with only 2 tables next to us and others dancing so that has absolutely no excuse for the kitchen to be taking so long to make our food. 3 when we try to pay our bill (which was only 38 dollars) I only had a 50 which is relatively close to the bill and our waiter said they didnt have change in the drawer, I mean its a 12 dollar change!!! What kind of a restraunt doesnt have 12 dollars change in the cash drawer?!?!?   Well thats my experience of this place and it was absolutely fucking horrible. I wish I could put zero stars."}
