{"text":"Great food.great place,owner is so nice and checks on you .started raining and he held umbrella for guests to get inside."}
{"text":"My new favorite place.  The food is AWESOME!  Very creative chef.  I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went back recently and wow has it changed for the better.  They must have gotten a new chef.  I'll go back again and get the boxty and corned beef!!

Great service too!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Each meal for breakfast comes with tater tots and a small fruit bowl. My sisters lox bagel was amazing. The smoked salmon on it was phenomenal. All meals were light and fresh.  Definitely will be going back. The atmosphere is cozy and has an Irish pub feel. Staff was great and respectful."}
{"text":"Cute place friendly service. First time to come here and we will be back good food. We started with the Reuben pierogis very tasty yummy! I ordered the veggie Boxty it was ok the vegetables were not very flavorful they are on top of potato pancakes the pancakes were pretty good but I wasn't to crazy about the rest of the meal. My friend ordered the Sriracha burger cooked well with fries for extra charge. She enjoyed the burger it was cooked perfectly and the fries were good and fresh. The whole experience was good we will be back."}
{"text":"The staff was efficient and friendly. The menu selection was limited with little Irish favorites.   I had the corn beef sandwich better than a diner corn beef sandwich, but not what I excepted from an Irish restaurant and pub.   I'm not sure I would go back.  Maybe one more try"}
{"text":"Great menu, great food. Excellent casual choice to get a drink and food. The bartender tianna makes a great golden delicious, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have visited twice since opening and can't be happier. When we first arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by one of the owners and introduced to our sever who were both top notch ensuring that our experience was top notch. I would defiantly start your meal with an order of Irish nachos or skillet cornbread (I highly recommend doing the upgrade with pulled pork as I could have eaten it as my dinner). When we ordered our meal you can't go wrong with the the bacon wrapped meatloaf, boxties(which are Irish pancakes topped with meat or veggies), adult grilled cheese or ohio city pasta (ours had blackened chicken, broccoli, and a delicious cheese sauce). I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. If your in the neighborhood make sure you stop in you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I had been to this establishment under its previous name. I can't remember what that was, which is not a big deal apparently because Gandalf's was great. It's small so during prime hours there will be a wait. We went to the bar and got a drink while waiting for a table. I ordered a yuengling and it, unfortunately, was skunky. I took it back up to the bar and the bartender seemed to not believe me at first, but it was clear in my opinion and she gave me a different beer for even exchange. I appreciated it! We got sat in the time that was estimated and from there the service was amazing. Jay was our server. She was attentive and frequent, took care of everything we asked for. Between the four of us us we ordered the Irish nachos and cheese and flat bread for apps. The cheese plate was great and the flatbread warm! For dinner we had the Boxties, grilled cheese, fish and chips, and BLT. All the food was great. My only criticism is: as a vegetarian I found the meatless options generic. I got the grilled cheese traditional style, but almost all the salads had meat on them and for having a fun burger selection, it was disappointing that you couldn't get a veggie patty. No matter how you cut it, a growing vegetarian population is becoming a large part of restaurant clientele. So adding a veggie burger and/or tuna melt to a couple meatless salads (or discounted salad when ordered with no meat) would go a long way. I would totally recommend Gandalf's to a friend."}
{"text":"This is a gem. Great food and service tucked into the nicest little town. Free entertainment throughout the week. Taco Tuesday is great !"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on the patio.  I had the chicken sandwich w/tater tots,  hubby had the pork tacos. Both were really good.  We will definately  be back for dinner one day.  Service was good.  Place was clean. Not over priced  either.  Another good place to visit in Valley City."}
{"text":"High quality, consistency, and great customer service. Always a great decision. Limited menu focus on high quality ingredients and made from scratch dishes."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our visits to Gandalf's.  My wife has had a number of different items off the menu and she has always been pleased.  I've tried a few but I must admit I'm addicted to the salmon boxtys.  We love the atmosphere and usually sit in a booth in the bar if one is available.  Their outdoor patio is also very nice.  The service is good and the staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"Another round-the-world food outing for me and my co-workers.  Wanting something from the United Kingdom (close to Strongsville), we decided to head South and give this spot a try.  The restaurant occupies the old Riverstone Taverne (they've moved quite a while ago, I know) and now has a cozy pub-style vibe.

I was looking for a \"comfort food\" item to dine on, so I selected their version of a shepherd's pie.  The meal came with a small side salad, and I chose a unique dressing to accompany it.

The small house salad was filled with a nicer lettuce selection (no iceberg!) and topped with a tangy and creamy white French dressing.  It was very unique and paired well with the veggies in the salad.  The shepherd's pie itself was hearty and comforting with buttery mashed potatoes and a red wine (brown) gravy covering the ground beef and veggies.  It was savory and there was plenty of potatoes to ensure you got some in every bite of the pie.

The other guys all ordered sandwiches and a few ordered soup as well.  Everyone enjoyed their choices and we all left happy campers."}
{"text":"As a local Valley girl who was so excited to see this space occupied so quickly, I popped in here for a quick happy hour drink & snack with another local valley girl. We were so pleased! We sat at the bar & had a couple appetizers & a drink each. My Moscow Mule was the best I have ever had. The food was fantastic! The service was fantastic & the place was super clean! We had a nice chat with the staff as well as one of the owners. The menu is filled with local products & presented in a cute & witty way. Can't wait to get back for another visit. Great, great addition to the Valley."}
{"text":"i wish i could give additional half stars. 
pretty good, though i'd argue some items are overpriced I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and it was good but for $14 the serving size was a little chintzy. Danielle said her Rodeo burger w/ chicken was good but part of the chicken was tough to chew and she didn't finish that part. 
also, many items on their menu have already been blocked out - unavailable for order (the meatloaf and the short ribs, for example). 
the service was good. Jessica was pleasant and took care of us.
we sat outside on the patio. it was a nice night and it makes me question why Riverstone moved from this location to a \"strip\" style location near Drug Mart w/ no ambiance. dumb move on their part but a nice get for Gandolf's. the owner shut off the lights outside while we were still eating for some reason (still an hour before they closed) and Jessica was nice enough to turn them back on for us."}
{"text":"The Patio was great! Live music!
I had the shepherds pie for my meal. I recommend it. It was great. 
For desert I had Berries Foster. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to meet up with friends for a drink or a quick bite. Great atmosphere and the food is out of this world! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Beef stroganoff, shepherd pie and loaded tater tots.   It was burger Thursday and I was in a burger mood but was not disappointed with the shepherds pie.  Tasted the stroganoff, I will be back!   New waitress, Krista, was a blast, made the evening fun and did an awesome job!  Kudos!  Ask for her!  Maple pecan salad dressing very tasty and taking the maple bourbon pecan cheesecake home simply because I do not want to induce food coma!"}
{"text":"Great little spot! We ended up here for a last minute Easter Brunch - the waitstaff were very accommodating and friendly, the food was decent, at the atmosphere is cozy. 

I knocked a star off because my omelette was runny and the table should have been cleaned before we sat down, not while we were sitting at it. Personal pet peeve of mine!"}
{"text":"Food is consistent and the drinks cold. The lamb sliders and loaded tater tots are grand."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were extremely satisfied.  The hostess that greeted us was so nice.  Our waitress Terena was exceptional.  She made our experience memorable.  She had a great sense of humor.  Now on to the food!
We ordered some Stout BBQ wings to split.  They were very meaty and hot.  Then we didn't realize it was $6 burger nite!  What a deal...we ordered a Pub burger and a Cajun burger both with fries.  They came to the table hot and correctly cooked!  Very flavorful and juicy.  The other hit of the nite was the Reuben Pierogies my daughter ordered!  They are out of this world...we all had a taste and can't wait to go back!  Yes...Reuben Pierogies they are as good as they sound!  See my pics too!"}
{"text":"First time and we can't wait to go back!  Two steps in and we were instantly greeted.    Conversation with locals and Terry tending bar was superb.    The Irish Nachos.... like, move over poutine... this has ya beat!   Tasty burgers and always a cold beverage in your glass.  Looking forward to trying brunch very soon!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday, sat at the bar. Bartender was immediately attentive and nice. The place was clean. I got the veggie boxty which came with either a side salad or soup. I got the salad, which was fresh and large for a side-salad. The veggie boxty was really good, tons of veggies with a nice sauce, and the portion was large enough where I had to take half home (tho I am not one who eats large amounts at once). Hubby had the soup and cabbage boxty, and he couldn't finish his either and took some home. He liked both. All the food came out quickly. It was early so I can't say how they'd do with a crowd but we liked it and will go back."}
{"text":"First time visit and my only regret is waiting so long to try!  We had a full 5 top with 3 being kids.  My husband (a former professional chef) had the lamb sliders and I had the veggie boxty plus a cone of fries with the amazing condiments.  Everything was so good that we all ended up eating off each other's plates - that is a VERY rare occurrence...  Can't wait to go back and try more!  My husband was even impressed and he is a tough one to win over.  Many thanks to the kitchen!  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I stopped by again with family for Sunday Brunch. Had the eggs benedict with a side of tater tots. Excellent again!"}
{"text":"Walk a great place. Food was excellent. Service even better. Great relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really terrific service, atmosphere and food!  I highly recommend so much better than the previous owners!  We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with good food, a nice selection of beer, and an awesome outside patio. They have a three season room with heat lamps to use on chillier evenings. Service is awesome, they opened the patio just for my friends and I at 9:30pm. I never expected them to be so accommodating. Their new chef creates some wonderful unique dishes beyond my imagination."}
{"text":"Started with loaded tater tots and a couple beers. The tots were sooo good!!! Bacon, pulled pork, sour cream - yum. 

I ordered the Guinness Beef Stew and my husband ordered the Short Rib Boxty. Both came with a salad and their house made dressings, the dressings were really good and both meals were delicious. 

The menu has many choices and they aren't the typical bar choices! 

We decided to have dessert - even though we were full!! But since everything else was great, we figured we would try dessert! I ordered Berries Foster and my husband ordered Maple Bourbon Pecan Cheesecake. The desserts didn't disappoint! They were YUMMY!!! (The coffee was kinda burnt and nasty tasting)

The owner stopped at our table - it's a Mom and Pop shop - been open 3yrs!! 

GO SUPPORT LOCAL!!! 

We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Gandalf's! We have been a number of times and I have yet to have anything bad. The sandwiches are phenomenal, as are the entrees. The patio is fantastic too! I always bring guests when they are in town because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my visit here. The wings are by far the BEST I have had in the state of Ohio. The French fries are ridiculously delicious.  Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Valley City on Saturday night and they wanted to show us their local.  Came here and was greeted by the owners wife right away.  Very nice place.  Not too many stares from regulars.  Small places and towns tend to look at outsiders like lepers.  Band was playing in front but plenty of seating in back.  Close enough to hear the tunes but far enough from the vodka cranberry housewives screaching \"Wheels in the Sky\" by Journey.  We were welcomed with open arms and when we asked about the boxty she explained her husbands family was from Cavan and they know what good boxty is.  The rebel side of me has a great love for this Ulster county and especially the town of Killashandra.  We all had different stuff and it was all great.  Just enough food.  Pints went down great and were priced well.  Great selection of beers too.  Some to appease the townie folk and some to appease the city slickers like me and Big Red.  Heard their Thurday burger nite is a great opportunity to try some of the many burgers they have for 6 bux I think.  Irish feel in the middle of a tiny town is nice.

{"text":"I love finding places like this!  Tucked away on Rt 303 out in Valley City, I enjoyed a guys night out at this Irish Pub with my three sons, dad, bother-in-law and nephew.  Nice indoor and outdoor seating options are available and the hostess, and our waitress, were wonderful.

To start we ordered the Loaded Tater Tots and the Crispy Calamari to share.  I'm assuming the calamari was good because the kids knocked that out before I could try it.  But the Loaded Tater Tots were one of the best \"pub/bar\" appetizers I've ever had!  Crispy tater tots, black pepper and cream cheese fondue, smoked pulled pork, scallions, crispy bacon...what's not to love!

For my main course I went with my \"go-to\" entree at Irish Pubs, the Shepherd's Pie.  Perfect sized portion, great flavors...I was pleased.  It came with bread and a very nice and fresh mixed greens side salad.  Others had wings, burgers and corned beef sandwiches.  

Beer, wine and cocktail menu has plenty to offer.  Although we did't have desert, they looked really good.  They are also open for brunch on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Great fresh house salad with good homemade ranch dressing.  Pub burger and fries were both very good, also!  French onion soup was mediocre, but overall very friendly staff, and clean and updated interior!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This unique Irish pub would have only gotten 3 stars from me a year ago but boy have they improved! From appetizers to desserts to the music this restaurant/bar has become a personal favorite! 
They have improved their recipes and beefed up their service to warrant five stars!! 
The freshness of everything made is impressive and the service we received was \"spot on\". Terena our server was absolutely the best! 
I can't wait until their patio opens because it as absolutely beautiful! 
Give this place a try .. you'll be glad you took that short drive to Valley City! 
The photos are of the loaded tater tots and the berries foster (which is \"off the charts\" delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Gandolf's. Wow damn good food. I have to say the blackened alfredo is some of the best I have had. To make it even better I suggested that they blacken some shrimp and that would set the bar even higher. Our server was fun and good to us.(Michelle).  Good drink and great food. We shall spread the word and we will be back."}
{"text":"So we stopped here one day after a full day of being out. We found a parking spot and went in. It's a mixture of bar food and Irish and delicious. I really liked the environment and food. It was so good!!"}
{"text":"Definitely has a pub feel, I like this feel much better. I don't think this is a either or for Riverstone, definitely an asset to Valley City. 

Didn't have the food, but will next time - bar is cozy and has a great setup for music. 

Good deal, I dig this place."}
{"text":"Visited with friends for the first time in a while, nice cozy pub feel.
They advertise that a new chef is in house...
Exact same menu items as before, some are overpriced.
The advertised $2.00 taco Tuesday is actually a 3 for $6.00 special.
Tacos were severely under filled... they need to do better to survive in a competitive CLE food market."}
{"text":"This is a great pub!  Great service too!  Perch was awesome and so was the Reuben Perogies! Wow!  Love this place!!"}
