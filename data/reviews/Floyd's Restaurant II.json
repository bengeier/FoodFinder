{"text":"This location is definitely SUBPAR!  I much prefer the Graham Street location -  the food at Graham is better tasting and more consistent. Also, the Graham St. staff is friendly. 

My last two visits to the Milton Rd location have been a disappointment.  People smoking at the entrance. Slow service. Sub par food -- ordered beef ribs, they were bone rich and meat poor (in short, skimpy). The yams were hard and dry on booth occasions. The only salvageable part if the meal was the collards. Not enough to bring me back to Milton Rd. #disappointed"}
{"text":"My first time visiting and the food here was terrible! I ordered fried fish, macaroni/cheese, and yams. Couldn't order any veggies because they are all flavored with pork... Everything I ordered taste days old. If you want good soul food go to The Chicken Box!"}
{"text":"Alot of people informed me about this place so I decided to venture out and try. This was my first time going here and I must say it was OK. My chicken was salty I absolutely hate overly salty chicken  and everything else was ok. This place would not be a top choice place for Soul food. The best thing I could honestly say would be that the carrot cake for my desert was about the best thing."}
{"text":"The FRIED CHICKEN here is anointed! The mac doesn't look that great, but its amazing! Kinda like what \"what mamma used to make\". Very good soul food in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"it seems  that latley the food have been hit or miss..no sweets except on sunday and some of the food is either 2 sweet or salty. and the guy on register was slow. the inside has never been redone"}
{"text":"I love Floyd's now known as Donna K's. best fried fish in Charlotte! Best prices too. Casual dining or Take out!"}
{"text":"Donna K ummmmm  more like Donna No, When FLOYD left he took the good food with him.  The food is not that great hate to say it but its true"}
{"text":"2 stars was all I could give. There was the smell of weed when before I walked through the front door. I ordered a bacon double cheeseburger and an order of fries to go. When I got to my car (raining hard outside) I discovered the burger had no ketchup, mustard or anything on it and there was no condiment packets in the bag. Who does that? Also the girl who took my order acted like I was bothering her by being there. I like to give second chances so I will most likely give them another try."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm from a small town in the south and I haven't had food like this sense I left home. If you have a refined American tastes then you might be surprised by some of the foods on the menu. I will most definitely be returning to get my home cooking fix.  Try the make and cheese and the fried chicken. The stew beef is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Floyd's is interesting. I came here once when I was doing a selling gig of mine during the summer and I came back to try their food. So I came in for lunch for a take out as my brother and as well as a few friends came down from Raleigh wanted to try it out. I ordered the stew beef as well as doubled the side of the mac n cheese.

Let's just say, if you're going to work out or do anything active in the few to several hours dont. Because I was burping that stuff up and it just didn't feel good. But, that's southern food for you. I felt that the mac-n-cheese was a little watery and wasn't cheesy enough. The stew beef was okay, I guess. The problem with that was it was also too watery and it had no flavor. I was thinking that it would give me a punch because, well it's in a stew. 

I think I won't come back here for a while, especially since the aftermath of the meal was horrible. I think when you eat something, the process of eating it and the aftermath is wrapped into one! If you do come here, I suggest you to order the chicken as I heard it wasn't bad. From my experience though, stay away from the stew beef."}
{"text":"Its good not worth the price.  I can cook better and ceaper at home!!!!! I just wish it was not that ghetto, a little more upscale for price.  Trust me I can cook you a vetter meal for half the price.  Just the way it is, I live right up the street by the way."}
{"text":"BEST soul food place ever! when people ask me whats the best soul food place I always recommend Floyd's. Not that trash ass chicken box. Its in the hood tho but everything in the hood is good so their food is totally worth it. I used to be always coming in here wit my mama and they always recognized us! Love the hospitality they got round there"}
{"text":"Best Crocker in town! Hands down!! The Mac & Cheese and the Yams are wonderful, with desserts that are to die for.... Yes the area is urban but the food is worth the value."}
{"text":"The best soul food in Charlotte the fried chicken is great yams are good greens, Mac and cheese, and the lemonade best time to come is during the week because it gets crazy busy on weekends"}
{"text":"Food was sooo good.. 

Exterior- Establishment is in the hood, and I didnt see a name on it but who cares.. Dont worry, your car will be safe!! This place is always packed,

Interior- Nothing to write home about. Booths and cafeteria style tables.. When you walk in they have a condiment stand with a table adjacent to it with local businesses flyers/business cards etc.

Food- Delicious! I ordered the fried wing combo with Mac & Cheese with Dressing. Everything I ordered was so good. The mac & cheese threw me off at first because they do not use elbow noodles , I think they were Penne noodles. Nonetheless it was good. THE DRESSING was my fav part. You can choose between gravy or broth to put on top of the dressing. Choose the broth!!
Chicken wings were fried to perfection and choose the Cornbread over the roll.!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I love the fried chicken really good, the rice and stew beef is excellent, I just wish they had better health practices with their sweets.  I had a piece of lemon pound cake today that I don't think they sold yesterday but instead of the putting it in the refridgerator I think it just sat out in the container it was in and spoiled.  And they sold me that piece today and well I got sick, I took one bite of it and said humm this doesn't taste right well it was spoiled.  So that makes me wonder do they have better practices with their other food?"}
{"text":"Yesssss this is the place for great SOUL food. The yams will make you slap your mama!!! I eat here almost every Sunday & Monday if I don't feel like cooking soul food this is the only option.... the fried chicken is perfect EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting some good soul food.  Bad soul food is what I got.  The fried chicken was okay.  Nothing out of the norm.  But still it was decent, and now for the long list of bad things.  

The location isnt in the best of areas.  But... Isnt that the case for the good hole in the wall places.  So, i am going to overlook that the location is bad, just dont go at night.  

Cleanliness: The place looked dirty in the inside.  But I still wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt since their sanitation score was in the nineties.  

Food: I got the fried chicken (white meat) with collard greens, mac and cheese and an extra side of yams.  With a roll. 

Fried chicken was ok.
Mac and cheese was NOT cheesy enough and it was watery.  This was NOT good Mac and cheese. 
The collard greens had a sweet taste to it. Some people may like that, but I don't.  It didn't taste good at all. 
Yams.... Some reviewers said that it would make me want to slap my mama.  That was a load of B/S.  The yams that I had was the WORST.  Watery and gross. 
And my roll.... Was burned.  

This place needs to shut down.  I realize that some places are a hit or miss.  But, based upon the yelp overall score of 2 stars... I should have known.  But I had to try it for myself. I left this place with a bunch of food.  And when I got home...my trash can received a bunch of it.   Never again......"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed!!! with Floyd's
 The Mac in cheese is made with the  CHEAPEST cheese, the cheese didn't even melt. To Collar Greens is season with too much SUGAR and the Chicken had so much grease I don't know if I should blame it on a new cook; they just don't care anymore.That why I'm disappointed with Floyd's"}
