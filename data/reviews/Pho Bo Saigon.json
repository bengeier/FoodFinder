{"text":"Excellent Pho here, will definitely visit again soon. Our server was very quiet, but polite nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is one if my top choices for Vietnamese food in Brampton!  The atmosphere is nice and clean. My favourite dish is the bun cha ha noi."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favourite pho  place in Brampton!! I've pretty much tried them all and I can honestly say this place consistently is good! The service is not the best but it's pleasant and family owned.  Overall, they are really nice people who try their best.  For $5  you can have a small pho that is fresh and tasty.  I also like their Banh xeo and found their pad thai to be delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Owner is really nice and all the staff are friendly too. Always busy and a lot of regulars. Have frequented this place a number of times. Will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"great food and great Pho. other dishes are also very tasty. the chef is a very nice lady!"}
{"text":"Usually my go to pho place in Brampton when I have a cold or the weather warrants hot soup, but I have had a few concerns/observations as of late.  1st the only server they have is a brooding teenager with headphones on...only one earbud in.  I know u can hear me bro cuz when I ask for a tea while I'm waiting you always comply.  When someone says thank you, normal people usually say your welcome!  This dude usually just looks into space with a blank look on his face...ok maybe your parents force you to work at the family business, but, shit, get a personality, I mean, your in the service industry! At least fake some semblance of a smirk or smile!  The broth and noodles are very good, but that's pretty much it...u only get three small slices of beef!  You might as well call it noodle pho! Not enough beef to warrant calling it beef pho.  I'll still go here when I'm sick, but only on Tuesday's cuz it's 20% off and I'll call my order in to avoid feeling bad for making the server do something! Maybe he wanted to do something great or pursue his passions,and hence, he hates his parents and customers from preventing him to do so.  How dare they! Make him work and help put food on the family table smh.  One star for each slice of beef!  The service at this place is not a reason to avoid, the best pho in b-town hands down, if u want friendly courteous service tho'...although he's getting much better. My moms tone is similar to his moms lol (Asian) it could drive one to wear headphones and long for greener pastures sometimes, so being in similar shoes. Understandable"}
{"text":"4 stars because I love their pho but service is sub par. I usually order an appetizer and pho dish. everything I have tried tastes great. I deal with the shotty service for the great food."}
{"text":"I do not know where to start...long story short, bad across the board. Service was terrible, given the fact that there was only one person working a full dinner service I'm not sure who to blame. Beyond that, I left this place in a state of confusion. When I judge Viet food (more than any other cuisine, being Viet myself), I judge by the complexity of the flavor profile-the depth of the taste, the texture of the food and the ratio between the protein, veggies and carbs. Let's start with the pho...(being the namesake, it is reasonably expected that that would be their specialty, alas it wasn't so), the broth was edible but nothing special you can't get out of a box, the joke lay in the ratio of meat and noodle. I can appreciate cost management but the only way i can describe this as would be stinginess...two-three small visible pcs of thinly sliced beef, does not a bowl of pho makes (I've seen places with garnishes more substantial than that). Same situation with their vermicelli. As for the grilled chicken and pork chop rice, what I got was a blob of very unappetizing textured rice and two pieces of dried grill meat... Lacking any side of greens and soup that would have been much appreciated to cut through the heaviness of the carb and dried meat (a standard at any Viet restaurant, good or bad). What was confusing was how full the dining room was and how this place operates and continued to do so... Through the food was not good by any standards, it was edible. However, I would rather drive a little further to get better food or invest the time to cook at home rather than returning. Definitely one place I won't be coming back for any reasons."}
{"text":"I work in Bolton and live in Georgetown  ... so today (Jan 27,2018) I have a craving for Vietnamese food but did not want to drive all the way to Mississauga. Pho Bo  Saigon was on the way home so I figured why not? Do I ordered Ph ?c Bit, Bún Tht Nng Nem Nng and Cm Sn Gà Nng for take out.  The total price cane up to be $33.50 ... a bit pricy for 3 dishes. The food was ok ... but not as good as what I'm used to ..."}
{"text":"Rating based on food and better service from the staff who also cook since the main server who was cleaning seems to hate his job:   Good food. Delicious broth and a tasty rice dish. If you can put aside any want for amazing customer service from the guy you see running around, the kitchen staff are very nice and helpful   I'd come back for the food definitely. Pork chop and chicken bbq, and the pho with beef balls and rare beef. So good.   Once again. Don't expect 4 stars e"}
{"text":"Food comes out fairly quickly, but drink orders arrive randomly through out, mine came close to the end of the meal, which was ok as they offer free tea so I still had something to drink. I found their meat/protein portions to be fairly small, though quite delicious. They could benefit from offering people to double their meat/protein for an extra $2-$3.  We were told by the server that Tuesday's are 20% off, not a bad deal if you are there on Tuesday. Overall a good experience, food remains flavorful... but room for improvement with meat serving size. I would even be willing to pay for a grilled meat dish/platter only to go with the meal.  8th time I have tried to order the Banh Mi  (A18 and A19) it's never available... a bit annoying at this point."}
{"text":"Place is good. Like the noodles, but there was some spice in the broth that was different, think it was cumin. Satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Well I saw that this place has a 4 rating, so I thought I was going to go in here and have a good experience.  I am not commenting on the quality of the food here because I didn't get to make it that far.  I went in and was seated right away.  I looked through the menu and ordered two items.  After 27 minutes, I was told one of the items was not available.  I thought that was strange because why wouldn't I be notified of that once they submitted my order to the kitchen.  Obviously my order was not submitted until quite a while after I put in my order.  I asked the wait time for the second item and they said it would be another 5 minutes which means that was also not started.  So I said I would eat elsewhere.  Many I came on a really off day but it was off enough that I would not go back.  I'll stick to Pho Peter next time."}
{"text":"Love getting take out Pho from here. I usually get vegetable pho, the portions are good, at inexpensive prices. They are usually quick with take out, about 10-15 mins. The food is always fresh and tastes authentic. My go to spot when I need some hot soup, for those bad colds. It's not your typical chicken noodle soup, but when you add that red chilli pepper to your pho, it tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant as one of a number of sit-down places in a busy and diverse plaza on Bovaird at Conestoga. Tea in a glass for each table occupant was quite welcome on sitting. Tables came complete with bowls for sauces and a plastic bottle of sriracha and other condiments adorned each. Service was slow with one server (eventually someone else emerged from the kitchen) serving a full restaurant for lunch on a Saturday. My order card waited on the table for a while before the waiter collected it. Banh Mi (sandwich) was served on warm and crispy French bread with fresh grilled delectable chicken and pickled veggies. I could have easily made a meal out of a couple of these had I not ordered a pad thai. The house special pad thai is full of assorted seafood, some of which probably wasn't quite right but I'm not a major seafood eater, and was served in an oversized scrambled egg crepe. Nowhere near enough peanut for the entire thing and large enough for two to share. Flavour-wise OK, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This food was amazing, and the service pretty good. The server was very Informative and his bubble tea was to die for! The service is a little bit slow but makes up for it largely with the food quality and the preparation, it is well worth the wait though. There was only one server when we visited and had to serve full tables. Flavor nom nom. I highly recommend this place.  Great place for your emu."}
{"text":"My boyfriends mom found this pho place when they first opened in a viet newspaper. Ever since then, this is our go to place for pho in brampton. The prices are reasonable n worth every dollar. The place is clean, a little bit small but they do have a tv. The business is family run n they're really nice people.  Today I ordered an extra large rare beef and tripe pho. My bf ordered rice with spring rolls n grilled chicken n his dad ordered a small pho. The pho broth is very tasty. The bowl was very big n full wit a lot of broth. They could have provided a little bit more of noodles but nonetheless it was a great meal for a windy first day of spring kinda day."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a couple weeks ago, had one of the best reviews for pho in the area. So I decided to give it a try.. I was a bit disappointed that there was not alot of beef and was very salty. Overall it was okay, and I would give the place a second chance, maybe next time get the smaller size pho had the large and was soo thirsty after eating it. But I have to say the prices are pretty fair and not overly expensive."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time during the family long weekend. We ordered take out and checked out the bakery next door while we waited. The owner brought the food out to our car which was very nice of him. Fried shrimp appetizer was good not too oily. Pho was not very hot but I would go back it was still yummy. We also had some shakes, the avocado and raspberry which are delicious! They offer 20% off on Tuesdays, not sure if it's the entire menu but a discount is always good."}
{"text":"I brought down my rating from a 5 because I feel that the service and taste of the food has gown down.  I really liked the place, pho was cheap, big portion, tasty. Now price is on par with competition, portions are still big, but taste has definitely gone down. When you taste pho you can tell the taste. Now it is either watered down or not enough spices. The first time this happened I thought maybe because there was  a big crowd (still shouldn't be an excuse). But on succeeding visits it  continued to be the same. One time I was the only one in the restaurant and it still tasted the same.   I'm not going to come here for pho anymore. They have a Tuesday deal where you get a small discount. I'll come that day to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Hidden Brampton Gem! I usually have a few other favourites in the city and I can now add this to the list .. Food was amazing service was OK but I'll definitely visit again prices are fairly reasonable as well"}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked in the freshco plaza next to the bakery. It's a small family owned vietnamese restaurant which also serves various Chinese and Thai dishes as well. I usually get the pho ga (chicken pho) but lately find they're really skimping out on the meat. My dad loves their Chinese rice dishes so maybe Chinese food is more their specialty. The service here is pretty good considering there is only one server. Orange slices are given at the end of the meals which is nice. It's not a bad restaurant; food is pretty decent if you're looking for something cheap."}
{"text":"This was my first Pho experience and i'm officially addicted. The atmosphere is very quiet and laid back. The restaurant is very clean and updated. There is options to eat in or take out. The food smelt amazing from the dining area.   The food was excellent. Everything tasted really fresh and the portions are large. I bought an extra large bowl for two to eat, and i probably could have fed another person.   I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"this is an excellent restaurant! I'm so proud to have them in my neighborhood! I'm already planning to have my business lunch hours here! their prices are good. the food is amazing! wide range from appetizers to full dinner dishes. their service is awesome every hostess and server is very polite. what I love is they also suggest dishes you may like to try. I noticed many customers during my visit are regulars! that speaks for itself! my dish was actually customized, I love my spicy food, but I wanted my Pho Hai  to be VERY spicy, it's not easy to satisfy my spicy cravings, but they have!! the restaurant has large tables and small table for 2. a TV on one side for you to keep watch of traffic and news. casual but can definitely accommodate business and large family outings! you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Very small food servings unlike other pho resto. Its good for people like elf. Very slow service too. We asked for water and the server took 45min to give it to us. Ugggh"}
{"text":"The pho is good. They skim off the fat from the soup which is great!   However, customer service is very poor. They are very stingy with the proteins in the dishes for the price they charge.   Tuesdays are 20% off which is one of the positives!"}
