{"text":"Great staff!! Super friendly!! Good food!
Very reasonable prices!  Great place to go watch a game!  Casual!"}
{"text":"This bar is absolute garbage. Waited 30 mins at our table before the waitress told us the back tables don't get service. Then why did you GIVE US MENUS AND TELL US YOU WOULD BE BACK TO TAKE OUR ORDER. 

Now the kitchen is short staffed. We have been waiting for food for an hour. 

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. This place is awful on a lot of levels."}
{"text":"Drinks are cheap because service SUCKS!!! Waited for some one to even talk to us. Finally left."}
{"text":"Not sure so just gave 3 stars. Here't the deal I was thinking of going here and after reading the reviews I am not sure. It would be ideal as I pass by it but the reviews kind of made up my mind. I looked at the menu and the prices are rather high for a dive bar who doesn't pay to advertise on tv like a Chili's or TJIF's. $10 burgers and $6 basket of fries seems at the high end of things considering. The $2 beer sounded good and for a place like this that should be the going rate I am not sure why their food prices are not in check. Very few of the reviews raved about the food either. There are other options."}
{"text":"It was a great place until I met the bartender \"mindy\". I think that's her name. She's a white lady with a short cut that looks like she's about 65. She called the police on me and my friend because she was mad that my friend decided to tip the other bartender and not her. She said \"we share tips\" but she never even spoke to us, so why would we tip you?! Long story short, the police said, \"I wouldn't tip her either if she didn't serve me\" so we went home. But I'll be sure to visit mindy again and NOT tip!"}
{"text":"Great pours, great staff. My favorite after work happy hour spot. The food is awesome and the crowd is always friendly"}
{"text":"So I knew this wouldn't be great but I was a little taken back. It was close to the hotel and had good prices. I agree with a previous Yelper that this is a local spot and outsiders are not very welcome. It's very loud but it looked to have a nice pool table in the back so it's fitting. 

The bartender was pretty nice since I was clearly out of place. She waited on me quickly and managed the fairly full bar like a pro. I ordered a salad, which came out quickly. It was fairly legit with chicken and blue cheese. It was heavy handed on the blue cheese, I didn't think I'd ever say that. The iceberg lettuce was okay but it didn't hold up to the toppings. 

This is a $2 domestic draft kind of place for locals to meet up. It's probably a great spot on a hot day for some cold drinks with friends but I'll drive further from the hotel next time."}
{"text":"This is a great bar if you are not full of yourself.  A good local bar across the park and good folks.  If you're expecting Vegas or South Beach, keep driving.  The food is good and the bartenders are very personable.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Good drink specials food was alright for bar food. Spicy fried pickles were pretty good. It was pretty slow for a Friday night I thought. Lots of TVs, perfect place to go watch a game. I will be returning."}
{"text":"It would be a great place to watch a game if the jukebox music wasn't up so loud. There are tvs at the booths with sound so it would be awesome if I could actually hear it. Too bad - wont be back."}
{"text":"I usually only post reviews when we had an excellent or a horrible experience at a place. Unfortunately, this is the latter. We've been to this restaurant before and have never had a problem. Maybe they were having an off-night, but I hate to say we won't be back because of it.

We came Sun around 5pm for a friend's birthday. Our waitress said she wasn't trying to be rude, but definitely came across that way. Just ordering drinks was a problem. They were out of some of the beers we ordered, and I had to remind the waitress 4 times that someone in our group ordered a sweet tea. When we told her it was our friend's birthday, she responded with \"You're lucky if you get a f**** beer in this place right now.\" We don't expect anything free or special at restaurants, but I've been here for my birthday before and they gave me a super-awesome free birthday shot! Not the case this day. 

She had to come back and ask us 3 different times what we had ordered because she couldn't read her own handwriting. They were out of honey mustard for my chicken tender basket. We asked about a burger that was on their online menu but not in the restaurant, and was told \"I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\" She told us countless times she only works on Sun and hates it there. 

Once she did get our orders, we waited 45 min and still nothing. 2 of the people in our party had to go (for their own birthday party). Our waitress hadn't come back and we saw what we thought was our food sitting on the counter. We went to go ask if they could bag it to go. They hadn't even started anything. So those 2 got their food and left (when they got home to eat it, none of their orders were right.) One of the guys in our party had his burger come out and it was burned. After being there over an hour, the waitress came out and said the chef had erased all of our orders. How that even happens, I have no idea. She said \"He shouldn't be working on Sundays.\" We asked how long it will be and she said he hadn't even started it yet. So we left. They didn't charge us for the burned burger, which was nice but did pay for the 2 wrong orders and beers.

We tried to cut her some slack - some of us have serving experience and know how stressful it can be. But I never want to hear a waitress cussing and saying how much she hates her job. We ended up going to another restaurant. Again, the last time we were here it was a great experience, so we were very surprised and disappointed. We had been talking this place up to our group."}
{"text":"Pros: 1.) 24\" TVs at each booth that can be tuned to the game you want to watch. 2.) The burger was fantastic, as were the onion rings. The bun was nice and soft, and ironically, zero condiments were needed! 

Cons: 1.) Loud. Like, really loud. Unnecessarily loud. 2.) For the number of people that are here, about 20, it took about 25 mins for our food to come out. Not really sure what the deal was, unless our server forgot to put the order in?!? 3.) Service was a solid 3 stars. She was the only server for the whole bar, so I guess she did ok. However, if I were working 10 tables, I probably would not have taken the double shot that a patron bought for her. It def affected her pace. Just one little girls opinion though... 

There was an interesting crowd here. Not sure what else to say about that. Just not the a stage \"sports bar\" crowd, but then again, maybe it is for this place. 

The food was great, but unfortunately, the cons outweighed here... I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The bartender is friendly and gave me an extra lime and a cherry in my drink... it's the little things in life! Food is excellent and a great value, get the nachos. Very yummy. I also love the music here. Give it a whirl."}
{"text":"So much potential....but

The food is terrible, got the order completely wrong.  Asked for onion rings, they had two options plain and Cajun.  Cajun is covered with taco seasoning,  covered would have been one thing but smothered to the point inedible.  Undercooked fries...the place a fail.

The waitress who had 10 years she was holding attach itself to my wet glass, took it off my drink glass and gave change to her other customer 
The guy cooking the food was blowing his nose and not washing his hands.  I was sitting where I could see him do it.

Now for the constant crap music of Nickleback, Ted Nugent and Kiss was enough to make you cry.

So steer clear, don't waste your money, this place is awful"}
{"text":"Love their in house craft brews! The Ipa was inexpensive and very tasty. The food was great too. The best fried pickles I ever had."}
{"text":"Great local hang out!  Excellent prices for beverages and good food!  Pool tables and lots of tvs."}
{"text":"Love this place, great bartenders.  One of my favorite places in Charlotte! I love the staff and the food is amazing, especially the wings.  Blake and Bruce are the best."}
{"text":"Great little sportsbar with many TV's.  Great selection of beers and excellent staff.  Music was a little too loud for me but I still loved the place."}
{"text":"Someone from here reached out to my dinner group about having an event here.  

The place is in the front of an office park across from Carowinds.  It is a bar with lots of TVs and a couple of pool tables in the back. Each of the booths has its own TV.

When I arrived, I mentioned to the bartender that I was with a dinner group and she had no idea we were going to be there.   Nice to see this was coordinated so well....

The place is not suitable for a large dinner group with only the bar, a few booths and about 5 bar tables.    Thankfully we had a couple of cancellations and were able to pull the bar tables together. 

For food, I tried the fried pickles which are described as \"A southern favorite with a little bite\".   These were actually some of the worst fried pickles I've ever had.  They were pickle spears cut into chunks and dipped in bread crumbs.  There was no bite to them other than the pickle flavor and the temperature.  

Then I had the rueben which was recommended by the bartender.  Worst Reuben I've ever had.  It was on pumpernickel bread.  There was little sauerkraut and it was smothered in thousand island dressing.  

I was trying to figure out what another review was referring to in craft brews.  For drafts they only had 3....PBR, Blue Moon and Sweetwater.   Maybe the bottled selection was better.

The only reason I could see coming back here is to watch a game or to play a game of pool.  Stay away from the food unless you've had a few."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be one of those people that wished there was an option for ZERO stars or even worse, but that time has arrived.

I'll keep this'un short as not to offend a patron or employee ... you know, cuz we're all offended these days.

The main reason for ending up at this establishment was my Mother was in town visiting and thought she knew someone who tended bar .... Long story short - they didn't know who that person was. A bit odd for a small bar if you ask me.

The atmosphere was sort of awkward as we seemed really out of place.. Like we ended up somewhere we weren't invited. The \"locals\" definitely don't make you feel welcome!! (Not to mention the story I heard from a coworker about his experience at DGBG) 


We still decided to stay and partake in food and beverage. As it all continued to go down hill...

Not many draft options. The one draft they chose was near the end of its keg life cycle. The 'waitress' stated they were going to change the keg and if it tasted bad she would get them each a fresh glass. That took an eternity, which turned out they were out of that flavor anyway. So, they switched to a bottle option.

She took our order once we finally decided on a food choice. Following the order taking - it also seemed like an eternity - she returned only to say they were having computer problems and the order never ended up in the kitchen. Mmhmm, right... We should've just walked out then! But, my parents - surprisingly - opted to stay.

Way too many minutes later the food arrived. It was okay. That's all there is to say about that.

The check? Yeah, that took an eternity just like everything else that night. I couldn't get out of there fast enough..

Never going back. End of story.

Wait, didn't I say I would keep this short? Hmm. Oh well, at least I think I managed not to offend anyone."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and good food.  Ask for Bruiser just don't look her directly in the eyes."}
{"text":"I actually love this place. The food is regular bar food, the drinks are strong and fairly priced. There is something about the atmosphere I love - it's a charming hold in the wall :)"}
{"text":"I call an endless supply of BS on a place that closes the kitchen before 10pm.  Especially since our group called in to make sure it would be open when we got there.  Double down on that since when I walked in, the first of 8, there wasn't anywhere for us to sit since it was so busy.  Kind of feels like they don't want the business."}
{"text":"Food menu was reduced to almost all bar food and fried food, food is subpar at best. Very local bar atmosphere, in fact if you're not a local you pretty much get treated like you are invisible. Went out back to smoke a cigarette and the atmosphere on the back dock area is out of control. When I came back in, even though I lifted my seat up like all the locals did and left my drink at my seat like all the locals did, they had moved my stuff down the bar to make room for the bartender who just got off work. This was not a problem because there was a seat available and I could still see the TVs at the bar. I went out a second time to smoke did the same thing and when I returned they had slid my stuff down the bar for their friend to sit. This time it was an issue because there was no seat available and the bartender who just got off responded with, \"You can pull up a chair if you want a seat.\" 
Beer is cheap that's the only benefit to the place"}
{"text":"More of a bar than a grill. I went on a Monday night. It had a handful of what appears to be regulars. The food was typical bar food.  No complaints. Nice staff."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I just came on a bad night or if that's just how it is. I came in solo, expected to hang out, meet people, play pool, whatever. Didn't finish my beer before I met someone and we headed to another bar. I'd be willing to give it another chance but not going solo. The bartender was nice."}
{"text":"Decent bar food, typical drinks. Overall not a bad place but if you aren't a \"regular\" then you feel out of place. Bartender was good and attentive and the cook did a good job. Typical hole in the wall bar, not the best environment but not bad either."}
{"text":"This may be the nicest looking (on the inside) hole in the wall place I have been to. We came here twice recently for Sunday football with a friend who lives down this way. 

This place is pretty basic... reasonably priced bar food (wings special on Sundays) and 2-3-4 drink specials everyday. I suppose most people are regulars. They are some loud football fans (ok, maybe just one very loud female patron who would scream and curse at the most obscure game). 

I personally was very happy with their $6 grilled cheese with tomato soup special. Especially the soup. It was savory and creamy. I would just drink a pot of that if I could.

It is a decent neighborhood spot. Probably does not worth a special drive (unless you're down this way for cheap gas). And keep your drink order simple, it is a bar, not a lounge, stick with beer, or something with coke/tonic."}
{"text":"Great simple bar. Servers have a heavy hand which is always welcomed. Food is better than decent for bar food. Cheap drinks, usually a good crowd. I hadn't been in almost a year and they all remembered how I took my drinks. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Across from Carowinds from which we were coming, hungry and tired. Nice friendly place to refresh, table-top tv to catch the olympics on, and bar food served quickly and nice and hot."}
