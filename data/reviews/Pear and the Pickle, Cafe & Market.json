{"text":"I came to this place while hiking on the Three Rivers Heritage Trail.  Now I will warn you, you have to cross a highway and climb a giant hill to get to it.  But it was worth it!  

The place feels like a cozy house to me.  The colors are really cool and there are several different rooms.  Also there are lots of outlets available.

I got the grilled chicken sandwich and it was very yummy.  Also the waiter was very friendly and helpful.  :)

I really enjoyed this cafe; it was just what I wanted!"}
{"text":"We had some major problems with service when we went, but our food was good. We may come back to try again and hopefully give a better rating."}
{"text":"I came by the cafe with family and friends in early December and was delighted! The food was delicious, the staff was extremely friendly and we never felt rushed. Definitely a hidden Pittsburgh gem!"}
{"text":"Pear and the Pickle is one of our favorite spots in town. As other reviews say, it has the best breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh. The food has all of the quality of other fantastic eats in Pittsburgh with none of the pretentiousness surrounding it. The space is nice and relaxing, and the staff has always treated us incredibly well. It's become a regular stop for us, and I would highly recommend heading up to Troy Hill to check it out."}
{"text":"One of the best egg and bacon sandwiches I've ever eaten. (I added a lot of toppings, including tomatoes and garlic aioli.)

Fresh ingredients and made with care.  Mocha was also delicious."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in search of breakfast or a cool study spot. 

I ordered a cold brew coffee and a breakfast sandwich, both of which were fantastic. I was skeptical at first because the price for a sausage egg and cheese was more pricey than what I'm used to, and the bread used was just a regular hamburger bun.  

However, it was really delicious. These people know how to make a good breakfast sandwich. Its definitely not what I was expecting, (two sausage patties and the addition of tomato), but it all worked together nicely and tasted great.

Street parking is also very easy to find, unlike in other parts of the city, which is a nice perk. 

I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I have ever encountered in my life! We were ignored and mocked by the smug barista. After that, I actually felt intimidated by who I assume was the owner. Expresso machine equipment was aggressively slammed while we waited. This was my third time going there and there certainly will never be a fourth."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were passing through town and found this place. We were not disappointed to stumble into this local neighborhood gem. Great food, good coffee and a cozy, eclectic atmosphere made for a positive experience. Highly recommend Pear and the Pickle."}
{"text":"I love this cafe. It has a lot of table space, great food and coffee. I really enjoyed my tomato soup and grilled cheese during my last visit. 

I also appreciate that they carry Millie's and Leona's ice cream sandwiches. It has some staple grocery items, like pasta and even laundry detergent. It's a neighborhood gem. I can't wait to check it out again in the summer."}
{"text":"Bacon, egg, and cheese on the softest bun. Stumptown coffee. Tasty other offerings! Great owners, awesome to have this gem in Troy Hill. Everyone should go.

Update: still awesome. Now with homemade sausage and biscuits."}
{"text":"Wow, who knew a place like this was in Troy Hill? I was inspired to come here by a picture of their breakfast sandwich that I saw on instagram (#millenial). It is like your perfect Pinterest coffee shop fantasy in this place. The coffee was delicious and the breakfast sandwich was amazing, and I appreciated the toys they had to keep my 1 year old occupied."}
{"text":"Pear and the Pickle is a welcome addition to Troy Hill.  My coworkers and I often grab afternoon coffee here in lieu of the office Keurig - can't go wrong with Stumptown. I've tried the veggie sandwich and the bacon + egg + cheese and they were both yummy. 

I also like that they sell cat litter."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. You should drop everything and go to Pear and the Pickle immediately.  The food is fantastic--house-made bacon, anyone?--and the ambiance, from the decor to Bobby's welcoming smile, makes this place a winner.  I'm so happy to see such a great independently-owned cafe open up here."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Beautiful ambiance with several rooms of space. Great tables and chairs for groups or individuals. And the food! The Rialto was soooo delicious! Full of great seasonings and lots of meat and veggies. And the full size is enormous! The granola with fruit super generous too. 
I would even say you get way more than you pay for. Super fresh food. And even out door patio too! Totally will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews about breakfast sandwiches brought us in. The service, house coffee, atmosphere, and market will keep us coming back. The breakfast sandwiches are as good as the reviews say they are! The deli and market of essential items will be great for a quick grocery run after work."}
{"text":"Came here after going to the St Andrews church for a tour, but before our next tour of a funky, hidden German art house that is right around the corner from this place.  

This place has good coffee and giant peanut butter jelly sandwiches for 4.50!   They've got bright, clean ( gender binary ) bathrooms, and a little library for adults and children. The aesthetic here feels hipster, and I love that."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches, great coffee and a fantastic space! It's my go to spot for meeting friends, doing a little work."}
{"text":"Oh my gawd!! So good. Went here for breakfast and their breakfast sandwich is crave-worthy. 

The space deserves mention as well. It is spacious and  cozy. Wouldn't mind spending a good chunk of time here. I will be back fo sho."}
{"text":"The tl;dr version of this review: darn good coffee + lots of windows + reading room/nook. Out once more on the quest to find new coffee haunts around the 'Burgh, I made my way up to Troy Hill to check out Pear and the Pickle. I was pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful area with lots of space and tables of all sizes to choose from. I enjoyed a Stumptown (!!) coffee in addition to a breakfast sandwich, which was made to order on a Mancini's bun with crisp bacon, egg, and a generous slice of pepper jack cheese. Service was not the most welcoming to start (hence the 4 stars), but I did receive an apology for the wait on the breakfast sandwich--though I gotta say, it was just about worth it. The market portion is cute and could be handy to pick up any pantry staples you might be short on. This would be a nice spot to meet friends for breakfast or lunch, and I hope to come back soon to do just that."}
{"text":"Stopped here after bicycling Open Pittsburgh today. DELIGHTFULLY surprised, fresh, fresh food. Friendly, don't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"The Pear and Pickle has been here for 2 years now, and they continue to earn loyal customers. They keep their customers by providing delicious food prepared from scratch. Like the biscuit, egg and cheese sandwiches we bought today. Remarkably satisfying meals served up with a smile. 

The multi-room dining space is clean, comfortable, and welcoming. There are spaces for groups, places to read a book, spots to work from a laptop. 

If you want to get to know the owners, they are eager to welcome and get to know you. Community is present here, and you are invited to be a part of it. 

It's a unique place, and you can tell I love everything about it. The owner was planning on selling more groceries, but is moving more towards focusing on the food and beverages. 

Oh, but the desserts! Make sure you leave some space for the amazing sweet treats. Really great cookies, cakes and pies. 

The only thing left to say is to not put off your visit here any longer!"}
{"text":"brooklyn------D  pittsburgh.  troy hill facade, silver lake interiour.  boar's head, coffee, cool breakfast menu.  all nice touches, super thought through (it seems).  a great choice in a sneaky cool neighborhood."}
{"text":"As time has gone on, I've become more and more selective about my 5 star ratings. In this case, there was no doubt that this is a great cafe, well-deserving of a top tier rating. First, the neighborhood: it's great to see a place like this in Troy Hill and Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is Pinterest-perfect, magazine ready, and comfortable. It was full, but not crowded. Bustling, but not loud. Iron & Wine, one of my favorites, was playing on the stereo while I was there so they get a star just for that. The coffee was quite good and you get a free refill. The breakfast sammie was stellar, really everything you could ask for in a sandwich, but the star of the show was the bacon tho.

All in all, this is the kind of place I'll take people when I want to show them what this town is capable of."}
{"text":"Had the good fortune of stumbling upon this place on my ride to work and I am so glad I stopped. Delicious latte and their sausage, egg, cheese, and tomato is my new pick for best breakfast sandwich in the city. Also I just really love the look of the place. Super cozy. Their decorator did an A+ job. Good music. Good service."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and the food is delicious. I had a breakfast sandwich and coffee and both were made with fresh ingredients and were very delicious. They also have a deli counter with prices that are about spot-on with the grocery stores. 

The space is \"farmer/rustic chic\" and very cozy and welcoming. The space is pretty large with ample seating. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stop #2 on our passport did not let me down! We arrived right as they opened which was good because it got busy super fast. This shop doesn't roast their own, but they brew a good cup of coffee. They also make perhaps the best breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh! It's a little out of the way for us, but worth the trip up Troy Hill!"}
{"text":"A great cafe with delicious coffee and incredible breakfast sandwiches that are fresh and made to order. The place has a real community-integrated vibe and Bobby is super friendly. We are delighted to make this our neighborhood go-to and have quickly become regulars."}
{"text":"Delish. D-Lish. The bread makes a sandwich, this place has awesome bread. Beyond the bread everything else is awesome. Had a turkey sub with pickles, lettuce, aioli, american: awesome sandwich.

Plus the owner profusely apologized for not being allowed to have dogs inside. Which to me is the sign of a kindred spirit. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch and it was delicious. I had the turkey sandwich and my husband had pastrami. They're very big sandwiches and they serve great coffee. Very friendly service. My husband has been back several times and loves it. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"First visit today. My Troy Hill Turkey was delicious. All four other companions loved it too. A welcoming, unpretentious space. Many great conversations. A neighborhood gathering spot. Wish I had one in my anonymous suburb. I would be there everyday. Many thanks."}
{"text":"This place is soooo cute! Many people recommended it and we were in Troy Hill anyways, so opted for a later lunch on Saturday. The spot reminds me of an old country store. I ordered a portobello sandwich, a special for the day. Hubs got a Troy Hill turkey and we both had ice teas. It came out to under $30.

Now, the food was amazing! My sandwich had a layer of pesto that was next to the cheese making for a very mixture. The roasted peppers were quite in as well. Not realizing how liberal the sandwiches were, the 12 inch turkey is large enough for two people. Hubs wasn't able to finish it, though tried he did. They didn't hold back at all on the turkey or greens. Quite tasty.

The people working here are so friendly! They didn't turn people away and let those who ordered closer to closing stay and eat. It's a kind gesture. 

The treats look tasty and I might be back just for those items!"}
{"text":"This spot is great!

I am a huge, personal, fan of Bobby and the staff that work here.

I just devoured some delicious chocolate chunk cookies and my second cup of coffee (Stumptown FTW). I've enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches, as well as a few pop-up food evenings that were quite spectacular. I have always felt like I am tasting quality ingredients, surrounded by a gorgeous atmosphere.

Thanks so much! Nom."}
{"text":"Very cool place, great set up, friendly owners. Tasty breakfast sandwich. They have an espresso machine and teas. They also serve lunch sandwiches which I will have to go back for. They also have a rooftop area where you can sit and enjoy your breakfast or lunch. Sometimes they serve dinner. Love little places in the middle of neighborhoods. Cheers to The Pear and the Pickle."}
{"text":"What a great place. There were 7 of us and we were all thrilled with the great food. The sandwiches and salad were perfect. It is also a great looking place. Bobby the owner and his chef both made us feel so welcome. Next time we are in Pittsburgh we are all going there again. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"LITERALLY my favorite place in Pittsburgh.  My friends and I go weekly to get their delicious egg sandwiches and lattes.  All of their food is so so good, the service is excellent, and the owners are so friendly and delightful. 

Also, they have a burger night once a month which has one of the best burgers in the city!"}
{"text":"This place is so charming and out of another era. It seems like an old fashioned market. There are three different seating sections. The one in the back has seating for 2-3 people at each table. One of the tables is the bottom of an old foot powered sewing machine. The middle section has a book and game shelf and has a larger table with beautiful fresh flowers. 
The front of the store, where you order, has plenty of charm and sunshine. 
The menu is one chalk boards above the counter. They serve breakfast all day. Their hours are short but the food is very good.  I've gotten both a custom ordered sandwich and breakfast sandwich.  They have a really selection of fresh breads and cheeses which I appreciate.  Come here for simple but good meal. They have a wonderful selection of homemade desserts and cakes as well as ice cream sandwiches. 
The fellow behind the counter is all business. Meaning he's not a ray of sunshine but I can overlook it as he has never been rude and the place is otherwise amazing. 
It's so good I've brought friends."}
{"text":"New favorite spot! The best breakfast sandwich in town, IMHO, serving tasty Stumptown coffee to boot in a rustic, cute cafe setting full of refurbished tables and chairs. Friendly staff as well and an overall warm hometown vibe. Plus, plenty of street parking nearby. Definitely check em out, it's well worth the steep drive up Rialto off SR28!"}
{"text":"This place is too cute! Love love the market vibe with cool artwork, flowers on the windowsill, books and games, and good music. 

I got the Reuben (that day's special) and told myself I was going to take half to go, which was a total lie. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed every bite! Definitely made with quality ingredients & love. Also got a house drip coffee which came with a free refill. Yum.

Came here to get some work done, which there is plenty of space to do. I do wish it was open later, but maybe I should just wake up earlier... Had some trouble connecting to the Wifi and they were SO helpful! I've been places before where they're like 'oh well, we're not tech experts!' which I get, but it bums me out when I'm trying to be productive and can't. Anyways, they checked in on me a few minutes after I got the internet password and I explained it wasn't working. Then they fiddled around a bit, came back over and helped me connect to another network. They were super apologetic, understanding and overall just cool. Real people helping real people!! 

Thank you! I will definitely be back to hang out more!"}
{"text":"Owner is originally from Michigan and spent some time in Brooklyn, just about 15 years. Found this gem in a tiny pocket of Pittsburgh's under rated neighborhood, Troy Hill. Perched on the hilltop, this neighborhood has been getting some hot spots. Hipster and locals alike merge here.  

Having lunch and love it. Kitchy and very Pittsburgh eclectic, your grandmother's plates but no Islay's chipped chopped ham. 

Great sandwiches and awesome soup!"}
{"text":"What a darling spot to find tucked away in a neighborhood full of history!  I had no plans to end up here,but thanks to a major back-up on the roadways, and the pouring rain, I opted to take an alternate route.

Thanks to Yelp, I realized I was in the same area Pear and Pickle was located.  Definitely a seize the moment decision for me, so I decided to stop.

What a cozy, and very welcoming encounter you experience as you enter into the doorway.  I love the decor and that comforting vibe it gives off. Too quaint!

One can't go wrong with the menu options they offer either.   Breakfast, salads, soups or sandwiches are freshly prepared.  I like being able to put together my own meat , cheese and topping pairings if I want something other than their signature sandwiches. Coffee and tea is available as well.

Pear and Pickle is a great place to experience on a regular  basis.   Not only did I enjoy my lunch, but I learned a little history as well.   The name Pear and Pickle traces back to the time when there were pear orchards growing nearby, and when the neighborhood had connections with the local Heinz Pickle plant."}
{"text":"Pear and the pickle is the perfect hybrid between a market and cafe set inside the setting of what seems to be have been a house.

The deli menu on the day we went consisted of tuna sandwiches and reubens, and we went with the reubans, while I also got a cappuccino. The reubans were delightful and did not take too long.

There are three separate rooms with space for seating. One room holds a bookcase of books to read and games to play. Furniture and walls are very reminiscent of home--even with cases filled with china/fine plates."}
{"text":"Sneaky pleasant little cafe while passing through. Ole general store feel, with updated atmosphere. Tremendously tastey Reuben mounds of corned beef. My wife had a tuna melt delicious just the right blend of ingredients tons of flavors and with fresh tomatoes in the spring were fantastic. Pickles were delicious. Iced wildssweet orange teas full of flavor."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Troy Hill! This little gem is very reflective of the neighborhood itself-- hidden, adorable and super friendly! The atmosphere is one of the best parts about PATP. The interior is very simple, yet still has a modern rustic feel to it. It's also a lot bigger than you'd expect. There are three separate rooms to eat and hang, a mini grocery store with lots of basic and not so basic items and of course the kitchen. Everything is cooked right behind the counter.

I had a chicken sandwich and it was awesome! Not only was it delicious, but probably one of the biggest chicken sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life. They garnish it with the right toppings! The menu is what you'd expect-- sandwiches, salads, chips, etc. Prices are a little higher, but for the amount of food it's well worth it."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this cafe, I ventured up the hill to give it a try this weekend and I was not disappointed. The space, which used to be an old hardware store, was so inviting. The long wooden counter with fresh cookies and croissants and the menu of items listed all looked and sounded so delicious. My husband and I split a breakfast sandwich and a lunch sandwich and both were so good. Everything was quality and the staff was so helpful. 

The tables available for seating were mismatched with various different chairs pulled up to them, but it worked so well. It was so cute. They had 3 small rooms downstairs, and upstairs led to a neat patio that I will be coming back to sit on during the warmer months! I can't wait to return and try some more delicious things."}
{"text":"So happy to see this cute cafe pop up on Rialto street! Delicious sandwiches and great atmosphere - and who doesn't love Boar's Head meat! This little shop is exactly what Troy Hill needs!"}
{"text":"After hearing many good things about this breakfast spot I couldn't wait to try the breakfast sandwiches. This weekend was my third time back!

The cafe is along a small street, and you could easily miss it if you weren't looking for it. There wasn't a line, but the tables were full. We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and fruit, granola and berries. We had coffee and an americano while we waited for our breakfast. They offer a variety of cafe drinks. We loved the sandwiches. I had mine on a homemade biscuit. The biscuit was a little too much bread for my preference, but still very tasty. The granola seemed to be homemade as well. 

The service there was quick and we really enjoyed hanging at the farm tables. The environment is really inviting and cozy. Along with fresh flowers, they have many books, board games and newspapers available while you are there."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches in the burgh. Delicious bacon, egg and cheese on a Mancini's roll. Deli meats are very affordable and top quality!"}
{"text":"This place is unique to Pittsburgh and I'm glad I finally got to try it. I came here on a Tuesday morning with my girlfriend for a coffee and breakfast sandwich. I kept reading reviews and saw that seemed to be the most popular menu item. 

I ordered a regular coffee the sausage breakfast sandwich and added tomatoes. I questioned adding the tomatoes because they were 50 cents extra? Who charges extra for 3 slices of small tomatoes? Were they organic or were they a rare tomato grown out back? I just don't see the point in up charging for something like that. The sausage on the sandwich was just a regular patty. Nothing I'd never had before. It wasn't fresh homemade sausage, it was probably something prepackaged (excuse me if I'm wrong.) I was not impressed. If you're going to ask someone to pay 6 bucks for a breakfast sandwich then meat should (all) be fresh. 

My total was $10 and some change.

For a coffee and sandwich it was ten bucks? I'm sorry but that's over priced. My coffee was also forgotten about and there was maybe 3 people in the shop. I went up to the counter to get it and the owner went to get some and they were out. He asked if I would just have an Americana and I'm not picky so I was fine with it. 

Who runs out of coffee at a coffee shop when there are only 3-4 patrons inside? 
I'm happy I came to try out a new local spot but I'd probably not return."}
{"text":"I walked up to Pear and the Pickle and saw a gold  pear as their logo and thought... these guys get it. 

The whole place was gold! 

Not literally. 

Figuratively. 

I went on a Saturday morning and got a breakfast sandwich and a cup of drip coffee. I ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese on a brioche (I think) (\"I think\" there is about the brioche, not the type of sandwich as a whole. It's important I make that clear because the sausage egg and cheese was not forgettable. It was memorable. The bun was too. So, don't let this confuse you either. I just don't always know the proper names of breads. It's my fault, not the shop's. The taste...the taste I'll never forget.)(Thanks for allowing me to clarify). 

Best breakfast sandwich I've had in the city. Mark it. 

The coffee was okay, not the greatest I've ever had. It's okay. You also get a refill on the mug of drip. I'll go back to try espresso. 

The inside was incredible and the design style was something that should attract people. It's like Ace Hotel styling. Trendy. Cozy. But artsy. They put a lot of thoughtful work into the space, and I appreciate that in an independently owned business. 

The owner took the time to introduce himself and to give a history of the business, their journey, and their ability to pivot based on customer needs. They started wanting a heavy lean on coffee -  coffee shop that sold some food. But the pivot has occurred where they're a food place that sells some coffee. I think there's still some figuring out to be done there, but you can tell an honest person who wants to improve and add value to a community when you meet him/her. Pear and the Pickle ownership is in that category. 

There are some random groceries sold in the space to pay homage to the building and what it was as a general store. Awesome once you know - yet confusing to see random items when walking in. 

It truly was a great experience. They have a nice deck I want to try once the nuclear winter passes. It's good for conversations, and I'm not sure I would come with my laptop to post-up and work. That would be weird, I think. A breakfast date or a get-together with friends, on the other hand... perfect! 

What's ironic is you'd be in a pickle if you didn't go to Pear and the Pickle...and you would also be in one once you got in there. But the latter is what you really want over the former!!"}
{"text":"This cafe is truly a gem and it's quickly becoming my favorite breakfast spot in the burgh. It's cute. It's chill. It's a great hang-out spot. 

I've been here for brunch and lunch and I've gotten to try their breakfast sandwiches, the tuna melt, and the veggie melt. I don't think you can go wrong here. Everything I tried was filling and delicious. They are definitely serving up some of the best sandwiches in the city. 

Bonus points for offering Stumptown coffee and Leona's ice cream sandwiches. I'm in love."}
{"text":"Just the cutest little spot. Located on top of Troy Hill (yes, up Rialto St) sits the most quaint and warm coffee shop/eatery in the city. It feels like you're transported about 80 years into the past (in all the right reasons); the Pear and Pickle feels like you're joining a friend in their parlor for a coffee and breakfast. I just love the aesthetic, not to mention they retained the original built-ins in what used to be the old home's dining room. And you bet it's stocked with antique place settings.
Onto the food. My gosh. The burgers here were quite tasty. I got the regular burger will all the fixings. It definitely didn't disappoint, especially with Mancini buns-oooh weee!!! Grilled with butter--always a win!
We happened to stop in when Roundabout Brewery was doing a pop-up, so we were able to pair our burger with a delicious beer.
Definitely will return--anxious to try their breakfast sammich."}
{"text":"Really just a lovely place to spend time.  Tucked away on a mostly residential street in Troy Hill, Pickle and Pear has served me some of the best simple cafe food I've ever had.  As I'm writing this, I'm searching the library wall for a new book, eating probably the finest breakfast sandwich of my existence.  The perfect model of a low key neighborhood cafe and eatery.  The details really reflect the spirit of the neighborhood, making this place feel like it's been here forever.  Well done!"}
{"text":"we absolutely love pear & the pickle!  nothing beats a well-made breakfast sandwich, and every element of theirs are on point.  also, you can purchase bags of stumptown coffee while you're here!   they give you a complimentary cup of coffee when you buy a bag.  they are able to do a really good coarse grind of the beans for french press users.  we always end up lingering inside because the environment in the cafe is just so warm and inviting.  definitely a morning favorite!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch - we both had breakfast sandwiches. I had the Egg and Sausage - my husband had the Egg and Bacon. The sandwiches were delicious - hot, cheesy and the breakfast meat was excellent. Very substantial breakfast sandwich - definitely worth the price. The Stumptown coffee is great - no bitter taste like some of the gourmet coffees can have, Looking forward to trying the hoagies - They carry Boar's Head meats and cheeses which are the best. They also have Leona's Ice cream sandwiches - I am going to stop to get a couple of those! Cute interior and friendly staff completed the positive experience."}
{"text":"Super cute eclectic cafe, great quality food & drinks, very friendly staff, the atmosphere makes you want to sit down and hang out for a while. I look forward to coming back and mingling with the locals often. My only gripe is I wish they had longer hours."}
{"text":"Great little hideout. Hip, bright restaurant/coffee shop with good tunes, good food, books, boardgames, and newspapers to enjoy. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I am a lover of sandwiches and this place does them right! Breakfast or regular you can't go wrong. The moment you walk in you can smell and see them cooking on the grill right behind you, often the owners themselves. They have great coffee and teas with house made syrups that are just so good. It's very homey and they have a large selection of complimentary books to read as well as some household items for sale. A nice and thought out assortment of seating, which I appreciate. I am also excited to try a dinner series there this year!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a long time and I finally got an opportunity to do so. It appears to be a reconverted first floor house with a small selection of groceries in the front. They serve both breakfast and lunch here along with Stumpton's fresh roasted coffee. I decided to opt for a turkey Reuben and a small chocolate chip cookie. They do offer an all vegetarian sandwich.

I also went for a spiced iced tea which had a bit of a zing to it. After I ordered I was told to wait until they called me by name. It gave me a chance to explore the place. In the center area is a beautiful dining room table and behind it is a wall full of children's books and games. In the back room were more cafe tables for people who were working. There was also some seating in the front area.

I got my food on a lovely dish you would get visiting someone's house. I ate in the big dining room just to soak in the atmosphere. All the chairs surrounding the table were different. On to the food. The turkey Reuben was moist and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The small chocolate chip cookie I got to go with it seemed dry and reminded me of a store bought brand. Still it is a nice place to check out when you are in the Troy Hill neighborhood. Parking can be difficult since only street parking is available.

They were selling the coffee by the bag and I learned that it was not flavored. It smelled good so definitely want to check that out on my next visit. 

I didn't price the groceries since there wasn't much of a selection. Next time I visit will opt for a breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time.  It's absolutely my new favorite coffee shop in the city.  Beautiful decor, great ambiance and the coffee and food are delicious.  Everyone is super friendly, as well.  They also have games available to play, which is always a plus! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"This little place is adorable! It's got a very Lawrenceville hipster vibe and fast friendly service.  The sausage egg and cheese sandwich was delicious and super filling.  My boyfriend ordered a 6 inch hoagie that was stuffed to the brim with enough meat and cheese to fill a 12 inch.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"What a cute place! Bigger than expected from the outside, and I enjoyed how they reuse older modern objects into furniture. 

Great coffee, and treats to eat. The prices were reasonable, and it's one of the few spots around Troy Hill that's open during the day. 

It was a nice refreshing walk to experience the smaller aspects of a city like Pittsburgh.

Bravo."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and consistent! 
The staff is friendly and helpful. 
In the warmer weather they will have outdoor seating on the roof! I can't wait to eat up there with the view!
The homemade desserts never disappoints and the grocery stock is convenient for we locals who forgot something in the middle of cooking dinner. 
The prices are very reasonable priced for the portion size and quality.
It's great to have such a wonderful restaurant a few blocks from home! 
They are now open on Sundays! 
I have nothing but great things to say about The Pear and Pickle!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Very friendly staff and quick service. The food is fresh and the coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast-sandwich addict, so imagine my delight to discover during a visit to Pittsburgh earlier this week that this pleasant venue has the best bacon-and-egg sandwiches in town -- well, maybe even the state. Nice job. Stumptown coffee, too. A little out of the way but worth the detour, especially for the friendly owner and neighborhood vibe."}
