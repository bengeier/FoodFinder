{"text":"Good food, friendly service, solid atmosphere and very clean!  The food is fresh and authentic and decent value.  Much much better than you would expect in a small stripmall....the restaurant has ambience but seems to have more take out business than eat in and therefore is quiet.  Our only criticism is that service was a little slower than we would expect.  
Enjoy...."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Service has that personal touch and the meals are authentic. Suggestions made by the servers were fresh and tasty. We plan to make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"I had the pad Thai noodles with shrimp and it was very good. The plate was full and enough for 2 people. The restaurant is so clean and atmosphere was nice. The strawberry daiquiri is one of the best."}
{"text":"Eating here last night, the place was practically empty, but there was quite a snowstorm so it was understandable. Service was prompt; not above-and-beyond, but what you'd expect. The inside is beautiful, certainly not what I was expecting.

We ordered mango salad and golden baskets to share for our apps. The golden baskets were small but very fresh and flavourful (I could've eaten a dozen). The mango salad was quite good as well, although the dressing is quite sweet; combined with the sweetness of the mango, it was a tad overpowering. (As an aside, the iced tea had something else added to it that made it taste very flowery; I'd recommend it, although it's quite sweet). 

We shared chicken pad thai, basil chicken and a green veggie plate for our mains. Everything was hot, clean and well-presented. Prices were fair for the quantities, but not great. This sure has potential to become an upscale competitor to Funky Thai across the road, as the food is prepared well and tastes good."}
{"text":"We justed moved here and this was our first Canadian meal :-D!!! We loved every minute of it. The food was amazing!!! The drinks were spot on! And the servers very extremely polite, attentive and very hospitable. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here about 2 months ago. Overall, not a bad spot. It wasn't very busy when we were there and the service was just ok.

We ordered pad thai and green curry chicken. While the food was good, i think it was far too pricey! There are tons of Thai restaurants in the Oakville area- you can get far more for your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"He serving is super slow! We are starving! There is only one table in this place which is us, but we had to wait for half an hour for one appetizer to come, and then waited for another half an hour for the food! The taste is about average among all the Thai places we've been too. I'm sure our experience of the food took a discount because of the long wait.

The owner and waiter are quite polite and seem very nice though."}
{"text":"Second time eating their food. First time I ordered Pad Thai lunch special for take out - it was pretty good...much more the authentic flavours than most of the Thai places I've tried. The second time my husband and I dined in and ordered the mango salad, pad see yew, cashew chicken and a mango juice. All our food was enjoyable...could have used a little more heat, but still good.
The prices are a little more than I usually pay for Thai, but I didn't mind since we enjoyed our food. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. Like other reviews have mentioned, service is slow...but it's friendly."}
{"text":"Great food but slooooooooooow service. Wish they would brighten up the place, it's a bit too dark to be romantic, and it's so dark in the bathroom hallway that it's downright scary. We were a group of 9 and dinner took almost 2 hours on a Tuesday night, with only 2 other tables being served. There was the odd take out order. Thai salad was a waste of time but the tamarind fish delight is heaven on earth. The appetizer platter for 2 was good, and the seafood soup was a little too tangy but had the biggest mussel the world has ever seen. Green curry chicken was tasty and not too spicy or oily. I like how they use fresh bamboo shoots instead of canned ones so there's no stinky bamboo smell. Pad Thai and red curry were good choices too. Highly recommended you have lots of time."}
{"text":"The soup is the best thing ever to make u feel better. And the green curry with rice is definitely worth craving for. These ancient recipe are different delicious in their own ways. The right flavour make the aroma of the food all flow together"}
{"text":"They forgot cashews in my 18 dollar cashew pineapple fried rice, which I got for takeout, cashew nuts are expensive, counting on me not going back to add my nuts. They'd be right, never going back. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Super slow service like real slow
However you can also tell they are genuine people but they are just slow lol
And like other reviewers have mentioned 
The Thai food here is pretty solid

I recommend:
Glass noodle salad, juicy yummy noodles w good sauce
Chicken curry, creamy and loved the heat
Thai vegetable soup (mix your rice in!)

I think they are a bit overpriced in both food and drinks
Each bowl of rice is $2.50
Each curry dish is $14.95

The washroom hallway is unnecessarily dark with no signs at all and one of the stalls cannot even be locked. Don't think the owner bother fixing it.

To me, dining experience should be holistic not just food not just service. It's about balancing. As such I can only give 2.5 stars rounded up. I hope they will improve because the food is really not bad here."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant near my house is very good! They provide authentic Thai food: curry, pha thai, salad, sticky rice mango... every dish is tasty! What's more, their washroom is elegant!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food! Been to Thailand a few times and the food here reminds me of the food I had when travelling! Service is not the fastest but friendly.

Had a very nice experience overall!"}
{"text":"Maybe a Toronto bias, but we really didn't expect high quality, tasty Thai food in Oakville.  Boy, were we surprised!  Spice level was good, one of the best curries we've had in awhile.  Tasty papaya salad and shrimp in one of the dishes we tried was cooked perfectly and very fresh.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Not up to the standard of Funky Thai, needs to polish up some of the recipes, the takeaway I had looked a bit scrappy when opened up and didn't have the \"fresh\" look and taste of Funky Thai meals. Will try it again as it had only been open a few days when I tried them."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place so far. You have to try the Mango Salad. Everything is fresh, smells great and taste wonderful. Also the pineapple chicken curry is my favorite. It's not busy which is great so you get more attention and better service. I like the setup too. Quiet, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overall: 4/5 
Thai Smile is a gem in Oakville. Authentic Thai food with consistent quality, it's a place that Oakville residents should try for sure! 

Taste: 4/5
The menu is extensive with a wide variety of items to choose from. Everything I've tried here has been great! Flavours mesh well together and all dishes come in appropriate portion sizes. I really like that they don't skimp out on the meat in the dishes (like a few other Thai places in Oakville). Some items that I've tried and would recommend: chicken satay, papaya salad, massaman curry, and their pad thai (a must try!). 

Service: 3.5/5
Service can be a hit or miss - with only one table dining in, the food did take quite awhile to be served however the quality of the food makes up for the lengthy time. The waitresses did their due diligence in following up to clear empty dishes,  refill beverages, as well as just checking in. We really appreciated how friendly the staff were. 

Ambience: 4/5
Spacious and clean with lovely Thai-style decor. There were quite a number of ins-and-outs for take-out; less people dining in which means you never have to reserve tables ahead of time. It's a relatively quite and tranquil restaurant, perfect for families or those who like to catch up over dinner (and can hear each other talking!) 

Tips: 
- Thai Smile is a little pricier than other Thai food options in Oakville but the quality is worth it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant seems to do better with take out orders as clearly they don't know what they are doing with customers in the restaurant. We ordered two cocktails, a lichee martini and a Caesar. My daughter after 20 mins did not get her Caesar and I had to ask several times if they are bringing her drink, finally she said we don't know how to make it - fine, it's not a bar so let it go. When I drank my martini, at the bottom there was a big piece of broken class with the crushed ice - I showed them, they apologized. Finally our food came, it was fine but my local Thai place down the street is just as good. When the bill came, they actually charged me for the martini spiked with glass! Never coming back. I complained they said sorry we have to charge."}
{"text":"This my favorite Thai food place after Toronto's Suki Thai. Everything is so tasty and the service is really great. We go here for every special occasion and I've even gone alone for lunch. The decor is authentic Thai and the food is amazing! 

I've had the pad Thai, green curry with shrimp (substituted shrimp for chicken), jasmine rice, spring rolls, hot and sour soup, salmon cakes, lemon grass soup, etc. 

I'd highly recommend the lemon grass soup and green curry. Those are my go-to meals."}
{"text":"Ordered pineapple red curry chicken. It hit the spot but wasn't anything special.  Would come back and try some different things :)"}
{"text":"The place is really nice with a great ambiance. Just be very very careful with their chairs, they reupholstered the top of their chairs and they hammered NAILS from the bottom that literally sticks out and if you put your hand on the edge of the chair to correct your body position a nail will poke your palm and you will be bleeding. It happened to me and my friend and then at the end I called the waitress and said I wanted to tell you something about the chairs, and she said THE NAILS ?? yea we know !! I was literally shocked of her answer. You know and you have taken the chairs out to be fixed putting every customer at risk !! 
Food is not bad at all, don't order beef, it's low quality and even chewy. The sauces have tons of sugar in it.. it makes everything so sweet it over powers the great flavors.
DON'T GO THERE TILL THEY FIX THE CHAIRS"}
{"text":"Given the previous reviews, I can only assume they were completely off their game when we attended 2016-04-09.  The service was brutally awful.  There were only a few tables occupied when we entered and those were littered with dirty dishes and beer bottles yet to be cleared.  There was one server who was obviously not trained.  He finally approached us after 25 minutes of our arrival.  He forgot the drink order and had to be reminded.  40 minutes after our one appetizer arrived(dish still not cleared) I walked up to the bar and asked \"how much longer?\"  He actually asked me what I was waiting for.  He had forgotten to communicate our entrée order to the kitchen.  I spoke to the owner who made excuses about Siamese beef(very thin slices of meat) taking a long time to cook. We arrived at 8:15 pm and did not see our mains until 9:40.  While good food, the wait was simply unacceptable given that there were less than 20 people in the restaurant.  First time I have never left a tip.  There are other great Thai restaurants in Oakville.  I will not be returning to this one."}
