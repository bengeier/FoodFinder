{"text":"Very nice brewery with very good beers! Bartenders are very friendly, music is good, and it's totally affordable. But don't go there for the food. Perfect to have a drink with friends!"}
{"text":"We didn't try any of the micro beers but the drinks were great and the nachos were so crispy! We were here on $2.50 Wild Turkey night so we were happy!!"}
{"text":"Cadre sympathique, bon service et surtout de bonnes bières"}
{"text":"Beer was great, bar in general was great actually but no food. Eat first before coming here."}
{"text":"The decor was nice, but the beers were just okay. I went early in the afternoon, so I don't know what the nighttime atmosphere is like, but I did try a sampler of the beers -- ok. Much better than macrobrews, but much less than what the craft beer world has to offer."}
{"text":"I was pretty jetlagged when I got there. So my impressions might have been altered. I was there on a Saturday night around 9 PM. And there was almost nobody: there was like five people outside and then maybe five people in and that was it. So, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I was too early.

The beer was good. I had the \"mini IPA\": a fully hoppy beer but not as strong as a standard IPA. A little too bitter for my taste but had an amazing floral aroma."}
{"text":"Great brewery. Probably #3 on my list of favorites that I visited. I had the Blond and it was very good. Not many people spoke English, but we were able to carry on a somewhat funny conversation with our bartender.  Giving 4 out of 5 stars because I only tasted the blond and my husband's Red IPA. Both good. I wish I had more time to try the others, and I did not try any food."}
{"text":"Le Cheval Blanc est la brasserie devancière, celle qui a su propager le germe du brassage artisanal à Montréal, voire, à la grandeur de la province. Ce broue-pub vaut bien le détour, ne serait-ce que pour la reconnaissance et le respect, bien légitimes, que chaque bièrophile devrait émaner à son égard. Le rouge prédomine; lanternes et chandelles créent une submersion lumineuse d'autant plus agréable que chaleureuse, rien de trop intime, idéale tant pour les pintes solitaires, que les ralliements augurant une soirées rugissante. D'ailleurs, l'endroit est souvent l'hôte de soirées culturelles : lancements de livres et albums, expositions d'arts picturaux, spectacles musicaux, etc.

La maison propose normalement une huitaine de bières bien distinctes : blanche (fermentée avec la levure originale du Cheval Blanc), blonde, ambrée, noire (stout crémeux à l'avoine, torréfiée), une saisonnière, et quelques créations risque-tout. Je me suis justement pris la Märzen (seulement 4,00$ le verre), une ocre d'inspiration viennoise au nez agréable, mais un peu trop pétillante pour le peu de saveur qu'elle offre. Je n'ai su dénoter qu'un très vague arrière-goût céréalier. C'est loin d'être la meilleure création, mais je vous rassure, la grande majorité des bières a du panache gustatif. La brasserie n'est nullement surestimée...

On y sert quelques mets pour les gourmets tels des nachos, paninis, saucissons, etc. Il est aussi à noter que plusieurs bouteilles importées nous sont proposées. Il faudrait cependant discerner les bonnes occasions des moins bonnes... Par exemple, la Houblon Chouffe (Dobbelen IPA Tripel), une bière de format 750ml, est vendue à 20$ la bouteille, alors que l'on peut se la procurer pour la moitié du prix dans une SAQ du coin...


-On y vend des chandails à l'effigie de la brasserie et des types de bière.
-Bière servie en \"cask\" disponible!!!"}
{"text":"We had the rudest bar tender helping us. She asked us to pay for our drinks before drinking them and stood over our shoulders until we paid. Then she called one of us \"cheap girl\" while leaving because we only tipped 10% due to her being rude and messing up another order (we ordered a can of 7up and she proceeded to pour the can into 7 shot glasses then gave attitude when telling her that's not what we ordered). Not a pleasant experience. They need more polite staff."}
{"text":"For tasty, inexpensive micro-brews in a lively atmosphere - Le Cheval Blanc is definitely worth a visit. My fave brew was their Popeye IPA - full flavoured but not too in-your-face hoppy, just a fantastic balanced IPA. My next was also delicious, a pale ale with Cascade hops from New Zealand I believe. Once again it was a fun bar to hang out, enjoy yummy in-house brews, good music and no TVs! Perfect."}
{"text":"We came here on a friend's recommendation and it looked like a mistake when we arrived as the place was dead.  Nice decor, clean, and friendly service but not very happening for a Saturday night.  Then we looked up at the board and saw Jameson's shots for C$ 3.50 and it all became clear.  US$ 2.70 Jameson's shots in Miami would start a [crap]show that would probably evolve into a full scale riot.   Needless to say we started drinking heavily when we saw shots that cheap.  It might not be the most happening place, but this is a great spot to either start or end your night."}
{"text":"Stopped by this brewpub while vacationing in Montreal. While I cannot comment on the food, I can comment on the beer and experience.

The beer overall was not very impressive but OK. They had a few different styles and we tried 4 different ones. Also, the bartender initially ended up giving us the wrong beer and ended up pouring it down the drain. This is alcohol abuse! I am sure there was a local at the bar they could have given them to or alternatively given us them on the house. The atmosphere was somewhat dead and depressing with the workers more interested watching hockey on the computer.

In summary, better brewpubs in Montreal to check out."}
{"text":"Although I had some green unripe beer here once they have excellent stuff, and this slightly downtown-feeling bar is slightly hardcore but fun. Interesting locals and good unusual CV beers you might not see elsewhere, good stuff. Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a pint (they brew on the premises) and rather enjoyed it! It was winter, so we didn't get to enjoy the patio, but the interior is nice enough, and it wasn't super crowded (on a friday evening). Highly recommend for good beer and a fun bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Montreal pub-style bar that brews its own delicious beer.   Cool retro decor.  Love it!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars

This was one of the many brew pubs I visited on my last trip to Montreal. Unfortunately, it was probably my least favourite. I generally love all beer pubs and appreciate local craft beers but the overall experience resulted in fewer stars.

We had a table towards the back of the pub and it got so crowded. Every two seconds someone bumped into me, backpacks and purses hit me in the back of the head and I  could barely hear my friends talking. The overcrowding also made the pub very hot and uncomfortable. The worst thing was the music - some crazy industrial music that sounded like someone scratching their nails on a blackboard - just painful (and this is coming from heavy metal music fan for almost 30 years).

Given the above, it would be hard to enjoy any beer. My friends ordered a sampler of 8 beers so I tried a few including: Blonde, Imperial stout, Triple IPA, Export Porter, cream ale and Amber. My favourite was the triple so I proceeded to order two pints. I found the other beers to be in the \"average range\". They had roughly 10 brews on tap which rotate. 

The next problem was ordering the beer. Not sure they have enough staff here as it was rather painful to wave someone down (and I have a friend who is very good at this). Once we got someone, the were friendly and language was not an issue - they spoke English. Tourists should feel comfortable here. 

Also odd was paying for every drink right away but I found this to be a common practice at other pubs in Montreal.   

Not sure I would return but if I did, I would arrive earlier in the evening when its not so crowded.

{"text":"Bon choix de bière en général. Trop peu à grignoter malheureusement.

Beaucoup d'espace, grand choix de bières. Bref, un must"}
{"text":"Always wanted to check out this place, thank goodness I did! The overall atmosphere was laid-back with awesome music and beer to go with it. I tried the seasonal beer which was  raspberry and it was the absolute bomb."}
{"text":"Decent craft beers. Food menu isn't very appealing and the items are snack-like. 
Very large space, excellent for groups. 
They only take debit or cash as payment."}
{"text":"Micro-brasserie dans le Quartier Latin
Bonnes bières
J'adore la bière à la framboise maison l'été
Bonne ambiance, lumières tamisées, pas trop de monde mais assez pour faire des rencontres, discuter et s'amuser! On dirait qu'il y a toujours quelqu'un qui est prêt à venir vous parler :) très sympa"}
{"text":"Ambre, Double Porter, Blonde Belge, and La Pèette were all excellent. Our bartender also made us feel welcome despite our inability to speak French!"}
{"text":"Goutez à la bière coco bonheur (IPA crémeuse ananas et coco, pas trop amer) Elle est excellente! Pinte avant 8pm, pas cher. Excellentes bières

Nourriture = petite quantité"}
{"text":"Kind of a David Lynch vibe goin' on. Great place to get drunk before the tragic bus ride back to NYC."}
{"text":"Best beer that we had while in Montreal!  Had the Popeye (pale ale), it was super good.  Staff was also very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Simple brew pub in Montreal. Price is good for what you get. One of my favourite places to grab a pint in the city. I'll never forget the first beer I had here was a curry beer. A pint of curry beer is delicious as it sounds."}
{"text":"We came here because we fell in love with their beer. The place was packed, loud, and poppin! It had great beer, free WiFi, and lots of locals. Good place to try beers, beers, and more beers!"}
{"text":"went here for a couple rounds while in out of town.  got in around 5:30 & got the last 2 seats in the whole place - & the place quickly packed out.  obviously a hopping happy hour spot, & i imagine it's crazy later at night too.  a very open, warm, happy atmosphere for a bar.

no frills brew pub - seemed like about half the beers on tap were house-made, half were other fancy / delicious / snooty beers (depending on your outlook.  we managed to sample 4 different Cheval Blanc brews & thought they were all great.  

unfortunately they don't take cards so i had to stroll down the street to an ATM - bummer.  BUT after striking up a conversation with the bartender about the current student protests, he gave us our 2nd round on the house.  

when we left town we were bummed we didn't get a chance to return - will definitely try to make it back on next trip to montreal."}
{"text":"Le Cheval Blanc, qui a été une des premières micro-brasseries de l'histoire du Québec, propose bien davantage que la blanche qui porte son nom, mais qui est aujourd'hui brassée par Les brasseurs RJ. Le petit brouepub long et étroit propose un bon choix de bières brassées sur place. Si vous y passez, je vous recommande l'Imperial Indian Pale Ale, une bière houblonnée que vous ne manquerez pas d'apprécier."}
{"text":"The sparkling clean, tile-encrusted brewery of Le Cheval Blanc shown to me by the brewmaster after we had a couple of pints, doesn't produce much (its a six barrel system), but it certainly churns out fine beer to the taps of their dimly lit brewpub, embroidered in deep leather red, accented by steel and wood. Six CAD for a pint of a fine IPA (spiked with citron), well balanced, not too bitter, the citrus backed up by a judicious application of Citra Hops. Six CAD for an Imperial of cream ale; rich, filling, warming. 

Me and the brewmaster talk in broken French and broken English about our favorite wines and beers, foraging for morels, cooking large dinners for friends. Music plays softly; a back patio waits for the snow to melt. We go outside and smoke a Gauloise cigarette apiece, swearing against the cold (he in French, I in Arabic).  Its a nice moment; we speak of our beer and food, the failures of both of our nations  (Canada apparently sucks as much as the U.S. these days), of the loves and losses and pains of everyday life in a big city.  He wants to move to San Francisco, I want to move to Montreal. We both laugh at the improbability of either happening. 

I fall in love with the bartender, her boyfriend walks in, they share a lingering kiss. I fall out of love with the bartender.

A quick shot of whiskey (on the house), and I have to move out, my ruddy complexion sophomorically optimistic in the face of a cold too profound for a man from San Francisco to comprehend. The bartender gives me a half-wave and a smile, I fall back in love.

My mustache freezes in the winter air."}
{"text":"Not terribly impressive, but at least our waitress was friendly and the prices were good. My pint and a shot were just $9.50. The selection is minimal, and when we ordered pickleback shots, we got shots with pickles in them. Not sure if this is just a Montreal thing... especially since it may be my fault for asking her for something quintessentially quebecois to drink."}
{"text":"Fun  place  .   belle   ambiance  décontracté  . J'adore  !!!!"}
{"text":"I was so glad to come back here after many years away to see it's twice as big and still retains the design and feeling of this beautiful old brewer's bar. Dim, long bar, raised area in the back, and a great selection of homemade beers including a nice clean sharp IPA and a sour raspberry lambic. Service is busy, don't hesitate to wave them down, food is snacky but fresh and good. Beer lovers should check this place out, it's tucked a few blocks off St Denis and is in many ways the perfect bar."}
{"text":"This place is a go to for me and my friends now. First off the beer (especially cream ale) are delicious and modestly priced $6 a pint. They are brewed there so that's pretty cool too. The music is always good and is magically the perfect level, loud enough to enjoy but you never have to talk loudly to hear each other.

No dance floor, no outside patio for smoking. Lots of seating. 

I recommend this bar for relaxed nights with good conversations not really to get wild, party and cut a rug, but hey, who wants to do that all the time right? :) 

Definely go!"}
{"text":"The beer is outstanding.  The service is outstanding.  What are you waiting for?  Hop on a stool and let's drink!

I'm a fan of the Blonde, a standard but good drinking beer, and the Berliner Weiss, a light, crisp and fruity brew.  I also ordered a sample of the APL, a lager that I couldn't bear to finish.  
 
The bartenders are friendly, and she could see I wasn't enjoying the APL.  Instead I was offered another sample size (samples are $2.50 and generously sized), and I wasn't charged for the original APL.  Impressive.  

A regular pint is only $6, which is totally reasonable for a craft beer bar.

Business was picking up just as we were leaving.  When we arrived (maybe around 7:00 p.m.?) the small patio area was full, but the inside of the bar was near empty.  Nice place to relax if you don't like big crowds."}
{"text":"Read a lot of good reviews about the beers here, so went there just for beer (no food).  The place looked pretty retro, made me think of a 50s diner.  The ambiance seemed laidback and relaxed, but there weren't too many people there.

We sampled 4 beers: a pils, a unfiltered pale ale, framboise beer, and a stout.  The pils was extremely easy to drink as it made me think of candy.  The unfiltered beer was also pretty good.  My friend (avid beer drinker) like both the framboise and the stout, so overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Decent beer spot with a unique atmosphere. My beer had a flaw (diacetyl - buttery flavor) and hubby wasn't too stoked about his brew, either. Just OK."}
{"text":"Super laid-back with tasty snacks and a huge beer selection at a great price. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"In Montreal, you will not find a 100 plus beers on tap. You will find, however, bars that make there own beer. Known as A Micro Brew. 
Unfortunately , I have no sense of taste and I drink the same \" AMBRE \"beer each time I go to Cheval Blanc .... come to think of i, I really can go for a FRANBOISE right now !!! Or a nice tasty CH'FAL DUBLIN Irish Red . Ok , I am off. See ya there!"}
{"text":"This place is the first handcraft brewery that opened in Montreal, and is still one of the best and one of the most affordable.
You don't go there for food : they can sell you panini, olives or nachos, but they don't have a kitchen, so you usually don't take your meal there.  
You go there for the beers!
I'm going to this place since 15 years, and like all handcraft brewery, the quality and the choice of beer may vary a lot from time to time.  But in general, the beers are really good, the bartenders are really friendly, and the prices are lower than then the ones you find in Montreal.  Moreover, it's a really relax place, the music is not too loud, the crowd is sympathetic.  Perfect place to discuss and enjoy good company."}
{"text":"This bar is more of a neighborhood hangout with a great selection of beer. Cheval Blanc is a popular beer in Montreal and this is its home. It is micro brewery with a great selection of beer. If you have never been, I would recommend to check it out."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour la fête d'un ami. J'n'étais pas allé depuis un bout. J'ai bu quelques bonne bière brassé sur place. Leur IPA, une bière en fut et une bière sûre au fruits(framboise). La bouffe est sympathique, rien d'extraordinaire. C'était un mercredi et c'était étonnement occupé et le service était dans le jus. Je ne crois pas que c'était exemplaire d'une soirée normale au Cheval Blanc. C'est vraiment une bonne place à surveillé sur Facebook car ils ont souvent des événements . Un endroit agréable pour les petits groupes."}
{"text":"I've been drinking Le Cheval Blanc Blanche every time I visit Montreal. And, of course, I have to find the source of it. ;)

Le Cheval Blanc bar is in a walking distance from Barri/UQAM station. 

Too bad they did not have witbier and saison framboise when we stopped by, and those were the two we expected to try. Anyway, we did a flight, and they were super cheap. 

Hanging out in front of the bar was pretty amazing to wind down. 

So Christian, this is your next stop when you come up to Montreal."}
{"text":"fantastic beers - OOH the seasonal is full of such rich, spicy flavors, and the cherry porter has a perfect deep & tart balance - good music, and dim lighting. a girl couldn't ask for much more... except maybe get rid of the only uppity french speaker i encountered in my entire 5-day stay in Montreal! we visited twice and loved the place. the staff was generally friendly and helpful, but they must admit they have an odd payment policy: debit cards only, but not Visa debit. when my husband went to pay, he was clearly not understanding this, clearly getting frustrated, but rather than explain things in any other terms or find someone else to help him, the bartender threw her hands up in the air and walked away from him. left him standing there, confused, embarrassed, fuming. while he walked to the gas station up the street (which was out of order) to get cash to pay the bill, i watched her curtly correct another patron's French as he ordered for his 4 friends. how rude! and she repeated herself in case he didn't hear the first time!!  otherwise, had a great time here. just a shame to end on such a sour note. i really wanted one of those sweet t-shirts, but i wasn't about to spend another minute/dime talking to that snippy girl."}
{"text":"This is very much a no frills place but they serve excellent beer and the prices aren't too shabby either.  Expect to pay around $5.50 for a pint and the quality is very high for what you get.  I tried the raspberry beer and I have to say it is one of the better ones that I've tasted here in Montreal.  There isn't much foodwise but the nachos everyone shared were pretty good."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how long Le Cheval Blanc is been on my list but on this trip I finally made a stop and was so pleased I did. I ordered their Double Bonheur IPA, 8% ABV and was delighted with the quality and surprised by the creamy texture and head this IPA possessed. This was and outstanding IPA, Montreal has many great Micro Breweries and this one should be on your list when you visit the city. I am anxious to return and try some of there other beers and ales so stay tuned."}
{"text":"I know my jumping up and down, waving my arms vigorously for attention of a server would have been appreciated one day... and my Yelp Friends would be so thankful that I able to get them their beers at Le Cheval Blanc.

Finding a table or even a chair is not easy. I know it is a Friday night. Everyone in the bar here are looking for a chair..as I viciously guarding that empty chair waiting for the last of our threesome to arrive with 10+ people trying to steal it away.

Picking what to drink was easy as I know I want to do a sample tray. 8 beer of different style all labelled and the beers at Le Cheval Blanc is quite delicious.

We sampled:

- Blanc
- Cream Ale
- Stout
- Export Porter
- Amber
- American Pale Ale
- Triple IPA
- Imperial Strout

Nothing stand out to be my favourite but they all true to their style and were quite enjoyable.

The music here though a little too loud, definitely not a place to chill or talk to your friends! But hey, you can scream at them after a pint of cheap drink or 2?!

I would avoid coming on a weekend...... I just want to enjoy my beer not spending the whole evening trying to get my beer!"}
{"text":"A great bar with an impressive variety of their own beers. I enjoyed sitting on the outside deck an a sunny afternoon sampling a few of the offerings.  All great except one which was brewed with some local herbs and some smoked fish ( I joke you not), which was as bad as it sounds, but I give them points for creativity.  The stout did a great job in cleansing my palette."}
