{"text":"Food still taste great, service could be better. Came here at 8am. 4 tables and me. They seem to have a full staff, cashier, busser and servers at least 4 of them, so why is the guy next to me waving for attention because his coffee cup is empty and I noticed it was like that for a good while. At one point, not one employee was in the front of the house. Oh well, again the food was good but they specialize in red velvet so how can it not be.   Minus one star for service that could have been a little better."}
{"text":"Very overrated.   Pancakes were dense and not hot.  Strange setup with seating right on top of each other. I actually think Denny's has better pancakes than these.  Sorry, I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 more times since my last review.  Here's what I've tried so far:

I love the spinach benedict.  I'm not sure if it's because spinach and mushrooms are one of my favorite vegetables, but I really enjoy this dish.  The spinach is perfectly cooked the way I like it.  I hate it when restaurants overcook vegetables and it's mushy.  I also like the cripsy bacon in between.  The english muffin is lightly toasted and not hard like some places I've had before.

I'm not a fan of the kalua pig benedict, but it might be that I normally don't like pork as much as beef or chicken.  I won't say it's not good but it lacked a little favor and the only thing I've had here that I won't order again.

The honey toast is really good too.  I love the thickness of the bread.  It's simple but delicious.  It's so hard to decide what to eat here because I like so many things and want to try everything, so usually I would order a savory meal and something sweet like this as a dessert.  I know I'm such a pig :-P  Who eats dessert after breakfast/lunch??

I've also had the sweet cream crepes with bananas, which is a nice dessert.  They have honey on the side, but it's pretty sweet as it is.

My boyfriend ordered steak and eggs which I've had a bite of.  I thought it was a really good deal.  It came with 2 eggs, potatoes, 2 pancakes, and an 8 oz steak.  The steak was really tender, but my boyfriend said it lacked flavor.  All he needed was to sprinkled some salt and A1 sauce (which was provided along with 2 different hot sauces and ketchup at the beginning of the meal) and it was all good.  It was cooked medium like he requested, still pink on the inside.

Other than the food, I've never had to wait for more than 15 min for a table but I usually go during the weekdays or past 12 on weekends.  The service has always been good for us."}
{"text":"Omg, the food is amazing! And when it comes with a side of exceptional customer service, it makes the whole experience that much better. Second trip to this restaurant, and I'm not much of a yelper, but the service I got from Amanda today not only deserves a great tip but a few minutes of my day to take the time to thank her publicly. Thank you Amanda for your above and beyond customer service and that smile."}
{"text":"So I finally got to eat here after spending the summer out of town. The server said it was a rather slow morning, so we got fairly lucky. I did my research prior and read most of the current yelps and decided I would try it out myself. We were greeted with a smile and offered drinks almost right away, surprised that someone could be that happy at 730 in the morning. She was attentive and helped us guide our way throughout the menu to her favs, and we decided to order a full stack of red velvet to share and a country Benedict. When the food hit the table about 10 mins later I was amazed. Everything was beautiful and served with the right portions. The red velvet was soft and lived up to every part of the hype it deserves. So as I went back and wanted to review babycakes I noticed some of the more negative reviews and I started to wonder, does anyone address the issues as they sit in the restaurant? When the server comes back to check on your meal do you attempt to have the errors corrected or do u sit here and yelp about an issue you never asked to be fixed in the first place. The employees here seem so willing to help that I can't imagine anyone leaving here dissatisfied.  I'm sure remaking something your not happy with wouldn't be a problem. Take it from me babycakes goes above and beyond with theie service and homemade goodness they call breakfast, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. Service is good. Food is also very good. For guys, sitting and being able to watch ESPN on with flat screen is an added plus! :-)"}
{"text":"By far thee best breakfast cafe in Vegas. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere is friendly, and the service is great. Love, love the different variety of pancakes and the Nutella crepes is my favorite. The portions are always more than enough. Recommending this place to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"I adore babystacks been to pretty much all locations . I was excited about this close location blue diamond but I've ordered take-out 3 times & dine-in twice , only 1 out of 5 visits was I happy with the food, which was when they first opened . My order has always been messed up for take out & I always give them an extra 15 mins from the 15 mins they tell me it will be ready, when dinning in my pancakes we're not as flavorful or sweet as usual & the coffee always seems to taste burnt like it's been sitting around . I order the same thing EVERY SINGLE TIME.. Spam Scramble with egg whites & chocolate chip pancakes & I don't know if it's the cooks at this location but I'm sorry blue diamond, won't be coming back . I am satisfied with the staff always friendly though !"}
{"text":"I'm just a plain pancake guy. It was ok but the plain pancakes are nothing special. If you are going try something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"A unique blend of Polynesian breakfast food and specialty pancakes. My favorite so far are the red velvet pancakes! But I've also had the s'more pancakes and they were good too. I would choose a skillet over an omelet...wasn't too impressed with my omelet."}
{"text":"Really cool place to eat. Good food, great service, and the red velvet pancakes are a must have."}
{"text":"Today, We (me and Kalila) went on an adventure to finally try the red velvet pancakes that everyone has been talking about!

I ordered the corned beef hash (which was a no brainer after the waitress said that it was NOT from a can), scrambled eggs, seasoned potatoes and bacon pancakes. Yes.... BACON pancakes.

The corned beef hash was delicious. Scrambled eggs, good. Seasons potatoes weren't really noticeably \"seasoned,\" but it wasn't bad either. The bacon pancakes are a creative invention, but when it comes down to it, it tastes as if you took a bite of pancake and just so happened to shove some bacon into your mouth a couple seconds later (Don't judge. That's probably a normal thing for people who eat fast). The pancake with or without the bacon though, is really good.

Kalila got scrambled eggs, 4 sausage links, hashbrowns and RED VELVET PANCAKES! She doesn't even like pancakes, but there was no way we were going to baby stacks without getting the RVpancakes. She got them and loved them. They were really good! Kalila was nervous about the \"cream cheese syrup,\" but she loved that too! It tasted like the frosting that comes with toaster strudel. Scrambled eggs, just as good as mine. Sausage links, bomb dipped in maple syrup. Hashbrowns were tasty! 

Everything was really good! While walking back to the car, we talked about how much fun we actually had eating that meal. It was worth the road trip it took to get there."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.  Everything our group ordered was amazing. The red velvet pancakes are better than any I have ever had. We also ordered Kalua eggs Benedict,  sauce was fresh made and delicious. Will be coming back before we head home for another meal and to try some more of their amazing pancakes."}
{"text":"LoVe this place!  This was our first time at this location and we kind of thought, oh no is it going to lose the family feeling with a second Las Vegas location...  BabyStacks did not disappoint us in the least!  

The pancakes are delicious, inventive, genius!  I only wish they would introduce a variety platter of dollar sized yumminess.  

The rest of their breakfast fare is amazingly tasty as well.  Generous portions and totally yum!

The servos was just as friendly as we remembered!

Whenever we are Vegas bound thesis my favorite breakfast!  Ever!"}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned breakfast is the best meal of the day. I love funky spots like this one. I've been here a couple of times and have tried a savory dish and a pancake dish every time.
THE GOOD: the pancakes are amazing! Not only are they cooked flawlessly, but there are some creative toppings. Red velvet, banana fosters, cinnamon bun & s'mores. Hands down best pancakes I've had in years.
THE BAD: service isn't that attentive. There wasn't any sugar on my table and it took almost 10 mins to get the attention of a server. Also we weren't pressed on how we liked our half uneaten entrees. Which leads me to...
THE UGLY: neither anyone I've gone with or myself have ever gotten a savory dish that was good. The Kailua pig Benedict's sounded great, but I was eventually grateful they don't give you much pig. Pretty flavorless. This last time I tried the chili loco moco special. Horrible! Hamburger was dry, egg over cooked and it was served over dry jasmine rice. Why would you ever do loco moco over jasmine rice?
Bottom line if you want pancakes come here. If they had been average I would have given this place 1 star."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas  from Baltimore, Md. We stopped here for breakfast and the food, service and price was awesome. Came back 4 more times during our visit and each time was just as great as the first."}
{"text":"I have been going to Babystacks Cafe (formerly known as Babycakes) for years.  I think they had to change their name because of the Baby cakes bakery, but who cares?  The food is still as good as ever.  
As you can read from previous reviews, the red velvet pancakes are far and away the most popular item.  Don't get me wrong, they're absolutely delicious, but I can only handle a few bites.  I always order them as a side and share them with my hubby.  I mean, come on you can't come here and not get the red velvet pancakes.  I have tried various menu items here with Babstacks providing all of your breakfast staples.  The eggs benedict is always pretty good, and I have been tempted to try the Kalua Prok benedict but haven't had a chance yet.  Rick's adobo fried rice is always a good choice with fried rice surrounded by a warm blanket of egg omelet.  Pour a little sriratcha on it and you are set.  
The service is always pretty good here.  It can get very busy on Sundays when we usually go so be ready to wait (usual time for us is about 20-30 minutes).  But don't hesitate, it is worth the wait.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love babystacks pancakes and my mom loves the red velvet pancakes. The service is good. The people are very nice and the food is really good."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around 1pm, party of 6. Waited less than 20 mins. Had the best experience! Not only was the food amazing, we had an awesome server (Danielle)!!! Everything we ordered was delicious. Great recommendations from some of the locals: adobo omelet, loco moco with kalua pig, white chocolate macadamia pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes. The mac salad and seasoned potatoes were a plus! Loved this place, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Love the concept of having a breakfast place that has the general American breakfast options as well as a few hawaiian/Filipino options. 

Love that you can get a side of specialty pancakes so that you can enjoy your savory and sweet breakfast. 

Generally a burn em and turn em place. Quick service."}
{"text":"Too busy with too much wait time

Food was just ok. This is a classic example of what people perceive as a good place because it was a blind mouse leading another blind mouse

No it was not worth the wait. Next door brunch is just as good.

IHOP is just as good no kidding."}
{"text":"They have some of the best pancakes in Vegas.  

If I get a craving for pancakes, I make sure and go to Baby Stacks. They have locations all over Vegas and are generally located near all the busy city areas."}
{"text":"Yay my search for the best breakfast place has ended, but doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying other places. Babycakes has all the above...great service, clean, great selection of food, and location is not bad. 

My sister and I went here on a Friday morning (10ish), wait time was 15 minutes (not too bad). I heard on the weekends it get really packed which I could imagine since the place is pretty small. So we ordered the Rick's adobo fried rice and a short stack of red velvet pancakes. The fried rice was mMmMm yummy and as for the red velvet pancakes OMG worth it. 

I am definitely going to come here again and try the many different kinds of pancakes they have and other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place...but the service on this location wasn't as great as the other location. However, we didn't have to wait 45 min to get a table and it was on a Saturday around 10ish. Since I was on this side of town and had a groupon for this place...why not? It only took 10 minutes to get our table. Good thing we came at the perfect time because the people started to arrive and the wait was 30 to 40 min. The place was a little bit larger than the other location. 

It took about 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. I ordered the ranchero omelet since I haven't tried it, with the red velvet pancakes. My daughter ordered the LJ's scramble with the red velvet pancake. Her pancake took an additional 10 minutes to come out after we got our food. The ranchero omelet was pretty good with a kick of hotness due to the green salsa. The red velvet pancakes is still my favorite because it's not too sweet...dessert for breakfast is just the perfect way to end your meal or start it. 

Other flavored pancakes to try is the Rocky Road, S'mores, and White chocolate macadamia, Lemon ricotta, and Strawberry. They are all very yummy and will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Long wait! But the food is so worth it.. We waited about 50 minutes to be seated ( table for 4). Once we ordered our food was brought out in good time. And omg we ordered the red velvet pancakes 5 starts, cinna bun pancakes and hazelnut pancakes all were amazing. Vary friendly staff and fair prices."}
{"text":"This place really does have the best red velvet pancakes in Vegas.  Delicious...very fluffy!  And I liked how they have whip cream, chocolate chips and cream cheese to top it of.  The pork adobo fried rice is also really good.  It's wrapped inside a scrambled egg.  The flavor of it is perfect.  

I also got the scrambed spam one time; and it's just okay.  I don't think I would get it again; probably just stick to my favorites.  

I just wished the restaurant was bigger.  Because sometimes we have to make sure we get there early enough to beat the morning people planning to have a LONG breakfast.  Staff is really friendly also (oh, and I have probably mentioned this before in my other reviews; where we have noticed that when a restaurant is not busy it seems like you get bad service.  Bad meaning...slower?!  People hanging out at the back or by the bar.  Well, we had this incident once at BabyStacks since we went early.  My husband was waiting for a refill on his coffee and did not get it until 15 minutes later.  Weird, how that works; seems like a place has to be jam packed for people to keep moving).  Oh welll...still good and the price is alright :)"}
{"text":"The breakfast here never disappoints, the pancakes are always different and good. We have even at the location in Summerlin. Just have to watch what time you come because there can be a long wait at times but what breakfast place on Sunday morning isn't busy."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are so so delicious!  Wish there was a babystacks at home :)"}
{"text":"Holy moly...banana foster pancakes OH MY! I'm not even a pancake fan and I just couldn't put the fork down! Great variety of the good ol breakfast standbys as well but I know what I'm going back for.."}
{"text":"Great family breakfast place and the red velvet pancakes are the best. Love the staff and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"This place had been recommended by several coworkers as they are known for unique dishes.  The first attempt to go was on a Saturday morning at 10:00am...waaay too crowded so we left.  The second visit was last Wednesday with my son. I arrived first but was told I would not be seated as my son hadn't arrived yet..fair enough. When my son arrived I alerted the greeter who continued to seat others ahead of us...not cool. Service was a little slow and somewhat small portions arrived. Total dining time 2 hours 16 minutes...ugggh.  Flipside was the cooks worked so hard and the food was good. I will not return here but may try another Baby Stacks location."}
{"text":"Really good food but every time we try to go here way busy the need to open it up in a bigger place or another one but its worth the wait great food"}
{"text":"Do expect a wait----tick tock---menu looks DEElicious---tick tock---food FINALLYYYY comes. Now portions aren't bad & for the price; good match!!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the food,  the reason for the poor review is because of the service at the front counter. As people have already mentioned, it's always packed here so we always order food to go. Maybe I don't understand what exactly a tip is for but last time I checked a tip is for when you are being seated,  served/waited on... When paying at the counter they give you a tab to fill out for the tip before they proceed with the transaction... At that point I cross out the tip(because I don't feel I have a reason to leave tip due to not being seated and served) and return the receipt to the person at the register. No matter who I am dealing with I ALWAYS get nasty or disturbed looks when I don't leave a tip... Unless the tip is going to the cooks I honestly don't feel as I should be leaving a tip for the person who bagged my food or the cashier.  Maybe the process should be alerted or the workers at the front counter should be talked to about putting on a better face when they are displeased."}
{"text":"The pancakes were very good have to say they are better than original pancake house. Although this cafe is very small but clean.. Staff very friendly and knowledgable.. I def recommend trying it.. Get there early due to limited space the wait could be very long but worth it.."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast place! I have never had anything bad, and the menu is original. Only giving 4 stars as I think their portion sizes have gotten smaller, not always a bad thing."}
{"text":"The only thing appealing about this place is the restaurant name. My wife ordered the skillet with \"chili verde\" and it was horrendous!  Initial cup of coffee was cold. Pancakes tasted like metal. Waitress was rude. Nothing spectacular about this place. Mechanics garage cabinet by register?  Very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Great combination of flavored pancakes and hawaiian/filipino fusion comfort food like adobo fried rice. You better try the red velvet pancake as it is their best pancake with their signature sauce. Short stacks comes with 3 smaller pancakes.  Egg benedicts with hawaiian flavors like kalua pig will be on my list to order next time. Adobo fried rice wrapped in egg is huge for those who have big appetite."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but the two times I've been here was rather disappointing.  The red velvet pancakes was ok, the adobo fried rice lack flavor, 2 eggs, rice and 4 links for almost $9 is a bit overprice. Overall the food and service is just okay. I think the hype got my expectation high."}
{"text":"The food was well worth the wait. We ordered a variety of things and were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for breakfast. Good food, great service, and comfortable atmosphere"}
{"text":"OMG! Avocado Turkey Sandwich is sooo good! I loved it. Thanks Allie , the food server, for recommending it. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars.

Service - 5 stars, during my trip I came twice and had excellent service!

Food- 4 1/2 stars, the food tasted amazing but every time the waitress put down that I wanted over medium eggs they came out sunny side up, I hate when the yolk is extremely runny. 

Try the red velvet pancakes. They are absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy,.
I ordered a omelette with bacon, bell peppers, pepper jack cheese and jalapeños. Upgraded the short stack to chocolate chip. 
My omelette was good. The short stack was just regular pancakes with chocolate chips on top, they weren't mixed in or anything..."}
{"text":"after watching the sunrise at red rock canyon, this was a great place to stop for breakfast!

they have decadent pancakes (red velvet, Cinnabon, s'mores), or if you're feeling lighter, a make your own omelet option complete with a choice of whole eggs or egg whites.

you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Quaint, clean brunch spot that plays great music. The entire staff from the host to busser was very friendly. Our server Vangie (?) was on point. Boyfriend ordered the blueberry pancakes which came garnished with a generous portion of fresh blueberries & I had one of the most delicious club sandwiches ever. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love Babystack's food. Dislike this particular location. Extremely small and the hostess sat a party of 6 ahead of two parties of two (myself included) even though we had been waiting for 20 minutes. Will continue to go to other locations."}
{"text":"I never heard of this place before but I went this morning for breakfast and it look small but there motto get you in and get you out but eh food was very very good I had the eggs Benedict it was the BOMB even the orange juice no pulp btw..... Only one thing the pancakes were the only thing that was disappointing  to me... EVERYTHING HERE IS RECOMMENDED BY ME FOLKS. P.s. No small pancakes lol"}
{"text":"Usually love this place. The wait can be lengthy, but a weekday morning is not too bad.  Unfortunately, today I was in and ignored by wait staff for 10 minutes. This as I watched others coming in, seated and immediately getting their drink orders.  Once I did get my coffee it was lukewarm at best and water with melting ice like it was poured 30 mins prior. 

Finally got to put in an order along with the guest who sat in our lap (sarcasm) with multiple open tables throughout the restaurant.  

Good was good as usual so not completely disappointed."}
{"text":"As an aficionado of sleeping in, I'm particularly sad that BabyStacks is only open until the early afternoon. Their hours are just right for those early risers and those who like to munch for brunch.

Came here once for a quick lunch before work and loved the idea of omurice done Filipino-style. Immediately ordered the adobo fried rice and my food was out in no time. Someone was heavy handed on the soy sauce or I'm really sensitive to sodium, because fried rice was overwhelmingly salty. The egg and the macaroni salad helped tame it, but I was still gulping down lots of water.

That didn't deter me from coming back to try their kalua pig benedict and splitting a stack of their signature red velvet pancakes with some friends. They have the basic eggs benedict on lock. English muffins were toasted well, eggs were poached perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was creamy but not heavy. Love their Hawaiian twist on it with the moist kalua pork! I really liked their fluffy, tasty pancakes, but I'm more drawn in by their savory offerings.

For a weekday afternoon, they seemed pretty busy, but it didn't affect their quality of service at all. The wait staff was always very attentive and friendly!

Normally, I just sleep off my hunger and miss breakfast, but I'd wake up early for this. Willingly."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for breakfast. Diverse menu. I had rancheros.  Awesome. Eggs perfect. Service a give an A."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancake is a MUST! I got this as a side order with the adobo fried rice. The adobo fried rice is also amazing. Definitely one of my favorite places to grab brunch I really hope the branch out here to Los Angeles. I would probably go out here way too much."}
{"text":"Going in with a positive attitude and a smile on my face things quickly changed upon being greeted by the host, or should I say not greeted just asked how many are in the party with an attitude and frown. Not welcoming at all. The wait for a table wasn't bad but the wait for a refill lasted forever. In fact we never got one! Which made it hard to eat the worst French toast I've ever had. All in all, I WOULD NEVER CONSIDER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"The Ricks Adobo fried rice was amazing. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't wait to come back to Vegas and try it again."}
{"text":"Only negative is the long waits for breakfast, but, food is so delicious that it isn't hard to understand why they are so busy.  Whatever you do, make sure you order get pancakes with your order.  Kalua benedict is really tasty too."}
{"text":"My favorite foods to have for breakfast are pancakes or fried rice. To be able to have them both for breakfast was a dream come true. 

My family and I got the adobo fried rice, loco moco, the lemon ricotta pancakes, and a side of the white chocolate macadamia nut, red velvet, and banana foster pancakes.

Everything was so good!

I must point out the red velvet pancakes, they are definitely as good as everyone says they are. Nice and fluffy, and comes with a side of cream cheese syrup!
The only thing I wish they did was actually incorporate the nuts and white chocolate in the white choco macadamia nut pancakes. I was only able to taste it from the toppings they put on top...
Other than that, a great place to have breakfast or brunch at."}
{"text":"I must say this is amazing love the food . So you might wonder why is that I gave it 1 star and that is customer service . The hostess girl with glasses has no sense on how to treat customer."}
{"text":"NOT GOING BACK EVER AGAIN!!! 

The hostess didn't seem happy to be working she would seat all the large parties before the smaller parties of 2-5 this family came in before us and they were ask how many was in their party after everyone who walked in. There were 5 different tables cleaned and ready for their next guests. I was not happy we told the hostess we weren't interested for a party of 2 I guess they were too busy. We went to The Bagel Cafe much better. We were seated at the last open table and the waitress is much better.

Also I have to give 1 star under duress!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Friendly staff, excellent food. Prices... a touch high, but given the quality of food, completely understandable. 

Skillets are awesome, omelettes are great, and the Eggs Benedict options are out of sight (best hollandaise I've had). 

Vegas appears to have an odd approach to breakfast (later openings, no diners to be found?!?)  - at least, it did for us NYers. If you find yourself in a similar predicament, go here. You will be delighted.

If we come back to the area, we'll definitely be back to Babystacks."}
{"text":"A little drive off of the Vegas Strip but well worth a little drive for a more down home comfort food meal. There is a bit of a wait (we were a party of 4 on a Thursday morning and waited 30 min for a table) and it is a little tight. I would say that if there is a wait on a Thursday morning and they close at 2, it is most likely worth my time. The waitress was very nice and easy going. My husband had the club which was something he was craving and he was very satisfied. I have the blackened chicken sandwich and I was very good. The chicken was tender, the lettuce was crisp, the cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was just the right amount of toasted. The fries that came on the side were the ones that you would get at an old soda shop. They were thin but had a great flavor that I didn't need salt for."}
{"text":"Place is terrific.  We were visiting Vegas with friends this past week. We like trying food places and found this great place for breakfast/brunch.  

We went here as party of 12. The service was so attentive and kind.  Food was the bomb!!!  I had the kahlua pig benedict and a hazel nut pancakes.  Had some of my son's adobo fried rice (wrapped in egg) and it was delicious.  My son says it was one of the best fried rice he's  ever had.  I'd recommend this place to anyone in or visiting  Vegas"}
{"text":"My fiance loves pancakes and decided to take her to some place new. Found babystacks on yelp and was highly rated, my fiance loves the red velvet pancakes and the service was great."}
{"text":"Great eats.  This is a small restaurant but the food was awesome.  Everything was fresh.  The pancake was one if the best in town.  The customer service was excellent. Our server was patient and friendly...it was a full house and I had a lot of questions about the food."}
{"text":"Second visit - and glad I did. First visit service was kind of horrible so it distracted from my overall experience. Took family visiting from town on a Saturday morning - a party of 6 and the wait was reasonable.

Everyone raved about the pancakes - red velvet 5 stars, orange something - not my fav but they rated them a 5, banana cream pie ( my favorite!) 

The Kalua pig eggs Benedict - 3 stars, and although everyone raves about them, I wasn't :(. My muffin was soooooo soggy which made the entire thing just a big wet mess. 

Service - improved over last time- but this place really needs to step it up a bit - engage your patrons and discuss the uniqueness of the menu. 

I can't wait to try another round of pancakes!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast strawberry pancakes are delicious. I love the skillets my favorite is the cow boy. Every time time I go here it never fails."}
{"text":"The food was average to slightly above-average.  However, the service was out of this world.  Coffee was refilled before I could ask and numerous free gratuities were offered.  Highly recommend and I recommend also going before 930."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the service left a tiny bit to be desired but it was a Sunday. Recommend to anyone who enjoys a good filling breakfast."}
{"text":"My family of four (two adults two kids) went for Sunday brunch and really enjoyed it!  Don't let the sad shape of the mall it is located in fool you. The atmosphere is really nice, the staff friendly, and most importantly, the pancakes are spectacular!

We ordered two short stacks (3 plate sized pancakes). The kids ordered s'more cakes which had marshmallow pieces cooked into the cake and topped w chocolate shavings and golden grahams. Rave reviews from the younger set. 

Dad and I split the red velvet pancakes. WOW!  These were spectacular. They were moist and fluffy, with a cream cheese topping. Some of the best pancakes I've ever eaten. 

Portions are HUGE!  We split 2 short stacks and one side order of bacon between 4 people and had leftovers. 

Saw some wonderful omlets go by. May have to try one next time. Or the bacon filled pancake. Or the peanut butter pancake.  Bottom line is we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Very small cafe so seating can take sometime if you don't get there right at opening, i've waited up to 45 minutes before. Visually pretty pleasing, very clean, and the staff is as friendly as can be. I have had the opportunity to try many dishes here, my favorite being the Adobo Fried Rice, definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different for breakfast this am. Fantastic! Great food and great service. There was a line (Sunday morning breakfast crowd) but I was able to sit right away at the counter. Got the Kalua pork grilled cheese with a side of pancakes. The sandwich was amazing AND much to my surprise so were the pancakes! (I'm really picky about my pancakes). Def a must visit!"}
{"text":"Got the huevos rancheros and a short stack of pancakes.  The potatoes had very little seasoning everything else was pretty bland as well.  Reminded us of the food that they serve in cafes in Florida.

We thought the pancakes would be good based on what the place is named but they were not too exciting either.  Even the syrup they use is pretty tasteless.  If you get enough butter on them then they taste like butter which is an improvement.

The coffee was good as was the service."}
{"text":"On the lookout for more breakfast restaurants, BabyStacks Cafe sounded great. It really blow my expectations out of the water. The Pancakes were light and fluffy just the way my wife likes them and I tried the Huevos Rancheros which were pretty cool. Kind of like tostadas. The wife tried the Adobo's Fried Rice wrapped inside of an omelette. Will be back. And if the owners are reading this, add the Tiramasu Pancakes permanently to the menu! They are incredibly good."}
{"text":"Food is great if your in the mood for pancakes! It's mostly regular pancakes with the different topping on top but great. I wouldn't order anything else. Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes"}
{"text":"Damn you Rock n' Roll Marathon! Wait, I didn't even run in this years race. . . Damn you discipline minded (that's me). I could have had the Red Velvet Pancakes. I should have had the Red Velvet Pancakes! Actually my heart was set on Eggs Benedict and with my husband participating in the marathon later that evening we opted for a lighter option pancake to share, the original with strawberries and whipped cream. They looked so airy and light melty in your mouthy. . . Ohhh, carbs, how at times I miss thee. . . but not thy body that comes with the gluttony of your empty means. I also had a few bites of the Loco Moco and almost regretted my Eggs Benedict, almost.
Bring a jacket, it gets cold in there. Myself and others agreed unanimously the chill factor was evident."}
{"text":"I ate here on New Years Day.  It seems to be a family-run joint because, well, the whole family was there.  Half were working, the other half were eating and just having a good time.

Normally, this would be quite annoying and a no-no in my book.  When I eat at a restaurant, I don't want little kid(s) running around all over the place.  However, since it was New Years Day, I completely understand why they were there and it didn't bother me one bit.  At times, it was actually quite amusing.  The waitress' son is the funniest, goofiest, little kid, who reminds me of, well, myself now.  Yikes I need to grow up!

With that said, the food was great, and the waitress was friendly.  It's unfortunate that the place is in the middle of nowhere, but in my opinion the drive is well worth the quality of their breakfast."}
{"text":"I almost hate to post a great review because then everyone will find out about their great breakfasts and it will be even more crowded!  But setting aside my selfish desires to keep this a wonderful secret, this is one of my favorite breakfast go-tos.  The food is outstanding.  I love the adobo fried rice omelet, the kalbi beef ribs and garlic rice, and of course the red velvet pancakes.  They don't split checks, which is annoying, and there is often a wait even during the week days.  But I keep returning because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say; now I can come to Vegas and get my fave dish I eat at Eggs & Things in Hawaii.  Our server Cassandra was awesome as well as was the comfortable dining experience.  If your ever in Vegas visit Babystacks"}
{"text":"So happy this place has a location close to home.  I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, but too lazy to drive.  This place is great!  service is decent and I like the atmosphere.  Everyone talks about the red velvet pancakes which I did try, but I think the best pancakes are the banana cream pie.  A must order."}
{"text":"Pancakes galore!  Inpsired by cupcake flavors.  And they really do taste like the cupcake flavors.  We experienced the red velvet, macadamia nut, and cinnamon buns pancake stacks.  My favorite was the red velvet followed by the cinnamon buns.  Additionally, I tried Kalua pig eggs benedict for the first time here.  It was very tasty and with runny egg yolks too.  Cool menu items indeed.  However, prepare for the one-hour wait..."}
{"text":"i ordered the country fried steak.  this was cooked perfectly!!  it was perfectly crispy throughout and the gravy was yummy.  i always order the gravy on the side so it keeps its crunch. i would definitely order this again.

being the fatty that i am, i also ordered a side of red velvet pancakes.  they were really yummy, though ive had better.  i really like the cream cheese syrup.  it was light enough to eat with every bite of the pancake. yum-O!

i also had a sampling of the lemon ricotta pancakes. again, their lemon cream cheese syrup was yummy.  the pancake itself was very light.  

definitely a place to go try.  they have sooooo many varieties of pancakes.  i will definitely go back to try them all."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Small but not too crowded on a weekday. Service was decent and the Red Velvet pancakes and Kahlua Pigs Benedict are very tasty. The menu selection is pretty wide for those who are looking to steer away from the norm. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS is more appropriate in today's visit to this location. We were looking forward to this breakfast BUT got a server name SHAWNI who got to our table with a sour face with no good morning greetings whatsoever. You felt right away she's not friendly figured having a bad day already so I let it go.  

She took our order with attitude, fine ... she punched our order on a kiosk annex to us literally few feet away and I had to make sure the order we got had the famous red velvet Babystacks pancakes. So I asked , \" Excuse me could you please check the pancakes we ordered are the red velvet.\" She didn't even come address us back to the table just her head turned and said with an attitude, \" you got the buttermilk so do you want the red velvet? With such contemptuous attitude ... really?!?!? and came back to our table flailing her hands to us and said \"next time you order you need to say you want the red velvet.\" Are you effing kidding me?! I let go of her attitude initially but this time I couldn't and shouldn't let this one go!!!! I had to ask, \" are you having a bad day? Cz you are not friendly at all from the get go? If we were first time customers and not know the difference it is your job to explain your menu & any upgrade.\" I had to ask for a Manager because she was just plain RUDE !!!!

Is this what this place represents? Are their employees not trained properly on simple customer service?!?! 

A manager name Blanca came and tried to appease us, but it was too late, our morning already ruined what supposed to be a good birthday breakfast.

It was VERY DISAPPOINTING to get a HORRIBLE server because they are the forefront of the establishment and gives you a negative vibe of the place. Customer Service is so important and this SHAWNI so lacks of it and shame goes with the management as well to tolerate and keep people with no business waitressing if they don't want to serve then they shouldn't be in hospitality job!

CUSTOMER SERVICE breaks or makes a business and I highly suggest to the owner of this establishment to work on that and make it a priority to train their employees well.

NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AND DEFINITELY MAKE SURE TO TELL PEOPLE & FRIENDS TO GO TO THE BUFFALO LOCATION instead who has excellent customer Service and much better tasting food than this Durango branch."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Terrific variety of pancakes.  I wanted to try them all! The group ordered 4 different types (lemon ricotta, carrot cake, mocha chip and bananas foster). They were all outstanding!  The cream cheese syrup was delish.  The carnitas skillet was pretty good, could have used more meat and it was a little dry, but overall, yum.
Service was great!!! The wait was not nearly as long we thought it would be, especially for a Sunday morning.

Wish I lived in Vegas because I would definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  Wait staff very friendly and food was wonderful. Our first time here. We split the country steak and eggs with pancakes upgraded to the red velvet. Potatoes were seasoned perfectly. Pancakes we're sweet and rich but not too much of either. Steak and gravy was yummy. Perfect sized meal to split between two. I think we just found our new fav breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative breakfasts, with fun and energetic staff! This is my weekend spot, and the closest thing to a neighbourhood restaurant I've been able to find since relocating out here. Try the Huntington omelet with s'mores pancakes! Everything I've had so far is delicious.  Be forewarned, however, come early or be prepared to wait- this place gets PACKED on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait!!!!

The strawberries are amazing

and the red velvet rock every time and the carrot cake was good but in a showdown-- red velvet wins!!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were very good!  Looking forward to trying some of the others as well.  The Rick's Adobo fried rice was good... but it was a bit bland and missing something."}
{"text":"I went here for a red velvet pancake fix. I usually go to Grand Lux Cafe for them, but decided to try this local place. Pancakes were delicious! I still prefer the ones from the Grand Lux cafe, but these are a very close 2nd. I also got a veggie omelette, which was good but not amazing.  I was impressed by the variety on the menu. I would definitely come back again to try other items on the menu and have the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded. The seating is jammed right next to each other it's uncomfortable to have a conversation. That is if you can hear yourself speak in the first place. I've tried three times to eat here and always leave because I can't stand to be packed in so tightly with a bunch of strangers. Not private at all. Horrible atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Got the build your own omelette with seasoned potatoes. Good service. Somewhat of a long wait because it was sooooo busy. Will definitely return when in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"I don't love the atmosphere, it's not very cozy but the food is great. I love the Hawaiian selection here. Definitely would recommend the loco moco."}
{"text":"Food was good for the most part. Customer service needs work. 

I was really excited to try out Babystacks for the first time and it all started out looking good. They had a good selection of pancakes and it was so hard for me to decide which one I wanted, especially since they don't come with any meat. We ended up going with an entree and upgrading our side to a baby stack so that we could try out some flavors. 

The adobo omelette was tasty and a good sized portion. The red velvet pancakes we got as it's side was also really yummy.  They were moist and the cream cheese syrup wasn't overly sweet. All in all we were very pleased. 

Now our second entree was ordered later (since I couldn't decide what I wanted) and ended up coming out just as we finished our first dish. We were severely disappointed this time around. 

The chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes were alright...they didn't taste too bad, but they were pretty dry. The two pancakes instantly soaked up all the syrup we poured on them and texture was dry, sticky, and all wrong. Not enjoyable at all, but at least they didn't taste disgusting. 

Then came the baby chick skillet. The eggs we ordered over easy were cooked perfectly, but the entire dish lacked flavor. The chicken was microscopic because we literally found one piece that was smaller than the potato cubes. And to top it off, I found a piece of hard packaging plastic in my second bite. 

We stopped eating and brought it to our waitress's attention. She took the plate back and somebody else came out to talk to us about it. This lady inquired about where we found the plastic and when we told her, she  said that was weird because everything in the dish is freshly made and not packaged. That's exactly what I thought, but there is no excuse for foreign objects to be found in food and it wasn't cool how accusingly she spoke to us, as if we were the ones who put it there. 

Then they tried to give us a 20% discount on the meal instead of taking the skillet off the tab completely. This was very upsetting considering we only had three bites in all and left the rest of the dish untouched (including that tiny piece of chicken that was only found after thorough inspection). It was only after my boyfriend insisted they take the skillet off that they proceeded to do so. We still tipped our waitress $5, but I left extremely unhappy about how they handled the whole situation."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My first time coming, everyone was so friendly. Food was great!"}
{"text":"We arrived at about 11 and it was full they told us to wait for about 20 min & we actually waited for about 10. Our Server was really friendly. I think her name was Christi. 
I ordered the chicken fried steak with season fries and over easy eggs. Delicious! The gravy on the chicken is one of the best I've ever had. BUT They got three stars because we ordered a side of Strawberrys for the kids pancake & never got them. That was a big fail. Also my husband ordered over easy eggs but one of them was just really uncooked. It had all the clear goo stuff coming out. It was kind of gross. She apologized and gave us another one."}
{"text":"1pm on a weekday, no wait! Loco moco with garlic rice is DELICIOUS and the red velvet pancakes as the upgraded side is the perfect amount. Pass on the mac salad. Nice spot to check out away from the strip for a bomb meal at a much nicer price."}
{"text":"I was bummed out about this place.  Service was slow,  and people seated after us got their food before us. All around me people were enjoying their meal,  so I was hopeful. I got the red velvet pancakes,  my mom got the rocky road pancakes.  They took a long time,  and when we finally got them,  they were cold and dry. The rocky road pancakes had barely any syrup on them. The Portuguese sausage was lukewarm and ok, but not great.  We were starving, so we ate it,  but I won't be coming back. Oh well,  we tried it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Red velvet pancakes worth the visit. Love the Hawaiian selections in the menu."}
{"text":"First time here with hubby and it's one of the best breakfast we had. We ordered the adobo fried rice and the skillet chicken (it had spinach, potato, cheese, herbs) both dish was amazing! Recommended and the staff is so nice.."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  If I could I would highlight underscore make the word amazing stand out more. That is how good this place is! I found this place a few years ago before a trip to Vegas, and let me tell you this the only place we come for breakfast.  This is our first stop when we come to Vegas and our last stop before we head home. This place is worth the drive all the way from Cali. Everything we have tried we have LOVED! I have mentioned this place and brought our friends and family and they keep on going back to babystacks. Their specialty pancakes are to die for from the red velvet to the peanut butter and jelly. They are all amazing. And who would of thought to put carnitas in an omelet?? Everyone is so friendly and very attentive. If you come to Vegas make sure to stop by Babystacks you will NOT be disappointed and you will want to keep going back (just like me )"}
{"text":"Pancakes are light and fluffy, perfect. Eggs came out perfect as ordered hash browns crispy. Excellent service 
I will be back"}
{"text":"Babystacks is located across the street from Sprouts and I noticed the now open sign a few weeks ago. I love breakfast joints, and though there are several awesome diners in Henderson, the idea of a breakfast spot specializing in pancakes was appealing. I finally got to try it out this morning. 

All I have to say is BEST PANCAKES. EVER. Seriously. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes and my fiancee ordered the carrot cake. The carrot cake pancakes actually had pieces of fresh carrot in the batter, and both plates tasted like moist cake in pancake form. Both were also served with cream cheese syrup, which was amazing. I usually don't order pancakes for breakfast, partially because I hate store bought syrups. Babystacks makes all syrups in house and all batter is freshly made. 

I know some people in the reviews complained about the portion size, but I was actually grateful that the portions were reasonable. I got a short stack of pancakes, and as much as I loved them, I personally couldn't have finished my plate if the pancakes had been ginormous. I hate food waste and appreciate when food is high quality and a normal portion size, not crappy quality in giant quantities. For me, I left pleasantly full, not overstuffed and sick. 

I also thought the food was a good value. For two plates of pancakes, a side of bacon and coffee, our check was under $20. Again, I'm not really sure why some people are complaining about the food being overpriced. 

There are a lot of breakfast places in town, but Babystacks has done a great job of setting themselves apart with a gourmet pancake menu. I will definitely be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Giving this business one star because they refuse to seat incomplete parties even when there are over 10 tables open. I am on here all the time so I asked for the owner as I was attempting to have a business meeting, the hostess told me the owner was there. Blanca (who is not the owner, just a waitstaff) comes out and presents herself as the owner. They precede to tell me that they are not allowed to seat people even with 10 tables and the bar open. Know at this point I was less upset about the seating and more about the lies. They still refuse to give a phone number for the owner. What kind of business owner does not give a complaint number?"}
{"text":"Place is close to where I live so breakfast here is very convenient. My wife and I eat here about once every few weeks. They have gotten our to-go orders wrong multiple times. They have one dish that has spam with eggs and spam in the eggs. I am not a huge stickler, but they seem to get this mixed up themselves when preparing it. Food is good and hostess are nice."}
{"text":"So this place is amazing my server was great and the food was delicious ...Red  Velvet pancakes people ...."}
{"text":"love baby stacks! highly recommended. small shop with great taste. never disappoints."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast menu! I get the red velvet pancakes or white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes. Only down side is there's usually a long wait. I go about once a month!"}
{"text":"Tried this breakfast place after jogging and ordered OJ, Coffee and their Adobo Fried Rice.

*OJ was served cold with pulp and quite refreshing
*Coffee was standard, just enough to wake you up
* Adobo Fried Rice with hash brown, hash brown needs seasoning, the  Adobo Fried rice however, was flavorful.

Service was pleasant.

I will return and try the pancakes next time."}
{"text":"We ordered the adobo fried rice, corn beef, and red velvet pancakes.  Everything was delicious.  The atmosphere was very inviting and had the feeling of family.  The wait time was pretty long but it's what's to be expected for the food!  We will defiantly be coming here again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Best breakfast indulgence in town.  Prices are reasonable and the food and service is terrific. Typically you have to expect a wait, but we go so often we know when to beat the rush.  My favorite is the Cinnabun pancakes.  I typically have my breakfast entree and take this as my desert snack for a little later.  SOOOO GOOOD."}
{"text":"Its my first time to eat here...  came in with my family and was mentioning to them about their other locations.  Big disappointment was the food... ordered loco moco and their hamburger patties was hard as it was just heat up from being frozen!  Second i was not aware that my sister ordered a apam and egg slider and was asking if theres pancake or rice that comes with it... waiter said no but can order it as a side order! Well my sister got a side order of rice.  When her order came in, sister was surprised to see the slider egg and spam, she said she didnt know its a small sandwuch.  Well my sister is visiting from Saudi Arabia and theres lots of food here that she didnt know.  The waiter told her after putting her slider order that the side order of rice will follow!  I got annoyed that the waiter did not even explain to my sister what a slider is... that you dont eat it with rice!   Thats very disappointing!  I cancelled the side order.  Third, my sister is visiting from outside the country and always trying to connect her phone to wifi everytime she has the chance!  She was given a password that doesnt work.  I went to the counter and the guy told me its their wifi sometimes it work sometimes not! I told him its not the wifi its the password... He seems not to care on what i said!  #neveragain #saynotobabystackshenderson"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The red velvet pancake served with cream cheese syrup is just amazing. They are crispy from the outside and fluffy and light from the inside and with the cream cheese, the combination is deadly.
Do yourself a favor order the full serving which comes with 6 pancakes...  

We also tried the spinach Benedict. It was average not bad at all. But after having the pancake, I did not feel like eating it at all.

Come here for the pancakes, there is generally 15-20 mins of wait, but the pancakes are worth the wait."}
{"text":"We are from Arizona visiting over Thanksgiving and went based on the Yelp reviews. We found the food outstanding, the service outstanding and the price outstanding.  My son had the red velvet pancakes, my wife the Eggs Benedict.    As the Dad I really liked the \"Senior Breakfast\" for those of us that are 55 and up!"}
{"text":"All I can say is I \"LOVE\" the Adobe fried rice omelet. I sometimes just get the rice with eggs on the side instead of the omelet and that is delicious."}
{"text":"I went here because a friend said... \"oh, you have got to try this place, the pancakes are to die for...\"

So I did!  The red velvet pancakes were OUTSTANDING, the service was fair (he messed up my order), and the rest was blah...

So we know the pancakes rock, but the Kailua Pork Benedict  and garlic rice almost made me PUKE!   My friend said, get the garlic rice, get the garlic rice...so I did... ugh slap me hard with a tire iron... it was mushy and tasted like garlic.  SO WHAT!!!  The benedict came with cabbage, ick, ick, ick... there was not enough pork to provide a different texture from the muffin.   It was DISGUSTING PERIOD!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with all the other 5 star reviews!!! This place is top notch Breakfast and Lunch cafe! We were greeted and sat down right away we had a drink orders taken by Ariana she was great and polite! We did need a couple of mins for ordering food. Since, there is a lot of good food to choose from! I had the loco moco with spinach and mushrooms added to it! I had medium poached eggs, which were perfect! Everything was very delicious the macaroni salad tasted homemade which it's a plus!! I also ordered a baby stack the white chocolate macadamia very delicious! My sister in the other hand went the healthier way and had the Veggie Skillet with avocado added and subbed eggwhites! Finally eggwhites that are white and not burnt! She ordered a babsystack as well the famously known red velvet which are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came to meet a friend from across town. A sign on the window stated that they only would seat complete parties. I was fine with that until a party of two arrived, telling the host that a third person would be joining them. He sat them anyway. I asked to also be seated so that I could have some coffee while I waited. A hostess refused. I pointed out the inconsistency but she still refused. My friend and I will meet elsewhere."}
{"text":"i'm a bit torn about writing this review, but after reading the recent ones, i feel like i have to chime in, too...

we were visiting vegas from la this week and wanted to eat at some off-the-strip (read: cheap) places. babystacks actually reminded us of cici's cafe and ninong's cafe here at home in that they offer lots of crazy yummy creative pancakes, plus homestyle classic filipino dishes and are small family-owned businesses. unfortunately, the similarities end there.

red velvet pancakes, hazelnut pancakes, and banana cream pie pancakes were all fantastic. we liked how you could get just a short stack of 3 instead of 6 - who can really eat 6 pancakes anyway? the banana cream pie ones, especially - the banana slices in between each pancake plus the banana pudding on top... wow! the chicken adobo fried rice omelette dish was really good, too, and I'd definitely order it again.

now the reason for two stars: the corned beef hash was spoiled. like totally rotten, could smell it before tasting it. whoever cooked it should've been able to tell it was no good. we eat out (for breakfast, especially) all the time and this is the first time we've ever been served spoiled food. EVER. the worst part was that when we told the waitress that the corned beef hash tasted off, she didn't even seem surprised!!! she just asked if we wanted something else. only when she brought the new dish of bacon and eggs did she apologize. it was all quite shocking, actually. or maybe the sugar/carb high had us all foggy and unable to react faster. she did remove the dish from our bill without us having to ask her to - which was cool, but again, she didn't seem too fazed or apologetic about it.

when the hostess (who i'm guessing is the main proprietress?) asked us how everything went as were paying, i didn't have the heart to say anything about the corned beef. i certainly hope the waitress did, though, or at least brought it to the attention of the cook! after she took our plate away, i kept an eye/ear out to see if anyone else ordered it, but no other orders came out. 

so, two stars with reservation because the pancakes were so good, but really should be one star for serving spoiled food. thankfully my senses are in overdrive from the pregnancy hormones so that it only took one tiny bite to know the corned beef was bad, which i promptly spit out anyway. future customers, beware! or just stick to the pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! There was a good breakfast atmosphere, the portions were big, and the food was DELICIOUS! For the quality of their food (at least what I had), their prices are VERY reasonable. I had an adobo fried rice omelette and white macadamia nut pancakes. The omelette was HUGE and being Filipino, I can say it tasted very much like adobo. The pancakes were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! I'd have liked bigger pieces of macadamia (they were tiny little slivers that you almost missed), but I'm just someone who loves nuts, so that's only my preference. If they tell you to wait a while, do it. It's COMPLETELY worth it."}
{"text":"I think I would rate Baby Stacks higher if I could ever get in there to eat again!  I have stopped in on weekdays and weekends at various times and have been told the wait is going to be from 35 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.  What!? So I leave.

The last meal I had left me wanting more Baby Cakes - but not for the pancakes.  They have a FRIED SPAM breakfast eggs and GARLIC FRIED RICE that hits your salty taste buds just right!  Fry my spam crispy like my momma used to!   Get the upgrade on the rice - you'll love it!"}
{"text":"We tried this breakfast spot on our way to the mall one morning and we weren't disappointed. It's a bit disorganized at the front but the food and service was good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to go to weekly meetings at this Mimi's location and I loved it from the start. The food is ALWAYS great, I'm in love with the Buttermilk Spice muffin! They employees are always really nice and the food always turns out amazing!"}
{"text":"Me and a couple coworkers came here after a busy graveyard shift. Our server Miley was amazing.  They had a special pancakes called cookies and cream that were delicious. The banana cream pie pancakes just as delicious. They carrot cake pancakes were like eating a fluffy piece of carrot cake. There was 7 of us and only a short stack of pancakes make it out of that place. I will be back here"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast, red velvet pancakes are the best. The biscuits and gravy need a little more gravy so just ask. Coffee has gotten much better, used to be very better. The only bummer is the new menu doesn't have a senior breakfast anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everyone is so friendly and helpful and the food is amazing. Best pancakes of my life!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not.  We had to ask for silverware then ask for replacement silverware because of a dirty set. The server did not appear to enjoy assisting her customers. She leaned over my plate of food 3 times to pass food to my husband instead of walking to his side of the very small table. My eggs were burnt but my French toast was good. The other 3 people in our group enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"BabyStacks needs to open in the Bay Area!!

I ordered one of the specials, Lemon and Strawberry Pancake.  It was a lemon pancake topped with strawberry drizzle, whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  Served with a side of house sweet icing.  How could I not get this... I LOVE Strawberries and Lemon!!!
My husband got the Kalua Pig Benedict.  So much on his plate that he couldn't even finish it.
My daughter ordered the Red Velvet pancakes which was perfect!!
Her boyfriend had the B.Y.O.which again was such a huge portion that we had to take the rest to go!!
The bacon was crispy, they Portuguese sausage was good but the seasoned potatoes  lacked the seasoning.

Service was just ok but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Hey, it's a Hawaiian Denny's!

I've been here more than enough to know that this place, this specific location, is the worst. Every time I come here, I have to wait 20-25 minutes. And every time I come here, the hostess responds rudely to me when I return to ask if a table has opened up.  Last time, convo went something like this:

Rude hostess: \"I called your name already.\" 
Me: \"I heard you say 20 minutes and it's been 20 minutes.\" 
Rude hostess: \"I said ABOUT!\"

Woman, I'm not deaf, and what crawled up your ass? I always arrive before or on time. That's the point of setting a timer. Duh. Besides, there's no reason to respond to customers like that. Damn. 

I've tried to order take-out from here to avoid the long wait, but from what I've been told this location doesn't do that on the weekends....or so they say. I showed up on a Sunday for brunch and saw a few customers walking out with take-out. WTF?

I feel like the food isn't up to par like it used to be. I was hoping Lola Cora's Corned Beef Hash would be like a taste of home cookin', but it was dry and unbearable to eat. The Adobo Fried Rice...meh, unimpressed. The Country Fried Steak is pretty good, and the Red Velvet Pancakes aren't bad. 

What doesn't suck about this place? The waitstaff is great, and I've never had an issue. Rock on, waitstaff."}
{"text":"Big portions, tasty food, long line.  Looks family friendly with dishes large enough to share with the kids.  Breakfast came out lightening fast.  The banana stack pancakes is awesome!"}
{"text":"There is not much else to say other than Babystacks is hands down AMAZING. I come here at least once a month, if not more. I am never disappointed. Service is always on point. Clearly, all of the employees enjoy working there because they are always in a great mood. The food is also freakin awesome. I've tried so many things on this menu and have never once been disappointed. One of my personal favorite breakfast foods is biscuits and gravy and Babystacks has the best plate of biscuits and gravy that I have ever had. 

If you want an outstanding breakfast, go to Babystacks."}
{"text":"One of our fave cafes in Vegas! I see a new flavor....Salted Caramel Pretzel Pancakes?!? Should I? Hmmmmm...yep, I did that!! They were really good!! Warm,chocolate pancakes drizzled with caramel & sprinkled with pretzels & white chocolate chips! The service is always good & everyone is hospitable."}
{"text":"Great! 3rd time. First at this location. Service was wonderful. Cowboy omelet delicious. Red velvet pancake. Dessert!! These places are great!!!!"}
{"text":"Last week my friend & I had brunch here. It was pretty busy for a Sunday, but we were seated within 5 minutes of her waiting & me just walking through the door. They were waiting for the full party of 2 to get there. A little silly, but whatever. I wanted food. 

I was pretty indecisive about trying a new type of pancake, but my friend convinced me to try the banana cream pie pancakes. I had the country fried steak with an upgrade to the banana cream pie pancakes for $1.50 more. My friend had the Portuguese sausage & eggs with garlic rice with an upgrade to (I want to say) rocky road pancakes. (I was distracted by my own food I don't remember. Fail. :/)Both of our entrees were delicious! I loved how crispy my steak was & the gravy was savory. As far as our pancakes.. both tasted exactly as they are described. Definitely some good stuff! 

Whenever I want red velvet pancakes I have to go to Babystacks. Now, I have a new favorite: banana cream pie pancakes! YUM!!"}
{"text":"Didn't wait long to get seated which is a big plus considering a lot of the reviews about waiting. Loco moco was flavorful. Adobo omelet was so so, I found myself adding hot sauce to add more flavor to it. Breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage didn't have much sausage in it so all I tasted was the potatoes. Out of the three specialty pancakes ordered--red velvet, white chocolate, hazelnut--the latter, hazelnut was ah-mazing! Would definitely come back for stacks of those deliciousness! Red velvet was moist but was too sweet for my buds, next time I don't think I'll slather the cream cheese. The whit chocolate is nothing to rave about..just plain pancake with white chocolate chips on top. Atmosphere was cozy, friendly staff, and fresh food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with pork and im not ordering it ever again there was not enough cheese in the sandwich it wasn't gooooeey enough! It was basically just a pork sandwich thankfully i ordered 2 dishes including the adobo fried rice which was the bomb will order that again! Great service! I sampled everyones dish n they were all great especially the garlic fried rice so would of rated 4 stars..."}
{"text":"Average 
I had the omelette adobo which tasted more of pulled pork with rice with a side of Mocha Chip Pancake. 

From the picture the pancake look appetizing, but it's just a regular pancake with chocolate syrup.
I guess my expectations are just higher from Yelp's 4 stars rating"}
{"text":"Hawaiian Philippine breakfast fusion.  Place is small service is great.  Unfortunately didn't get to try one of their specialty pancakes, just got the regular pancakes.  Had the Kahlua pork Benedict and a Santa Fe omelet.  Guess I need to get the specialty pancakes to make the food experience better."}
{"text":"The salsa is amazingly good...the place totally feels locally owned.  Everyone was really nice.   The baby stacks were a little on the bland side."}
{"text":"Service is spotty but food is really good. I've like everything I've tried. Always a wait to get a table but I only go on the weekend so I expect that."}
{"text":"Super friendly server and tasty pork adobo omelette. Nice spot to have a relaxing breakfast."}
{"text":"Today I ate at a restaurant called Babystacks Café. Excellent experience I'd say 9/10. Friendly staff on top of a welcoming environment, combined with high quality food provided an ideal first meal of the day for me.

Hashbrowns 10/10
undoubtedly my favorite part of the entire meal, they were cooked just enough so that they were crispy but not to the point where they would be burned. I ended up getting a second order because of how good they were.

S'Mores Pancakes 8/10
I enjoyed these throughly although I do wish they had provided more marshmallows with them. Nonetheless, the short stack I purchased was more than enough for me, it was cooked well and not burned, and very flavorful.

Overall I would definitely return to this restaurant and I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Service was great!  Steak and eggs were cooked exactly as ordered and the corned beef hash was a-mazing"}
{"text":"Can't get any better for Sunday breakfast! Red velvet pancakes is a culinary sin :)
Adobo fried rice omelette was good too.
+++"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pancakes, ordinarilly, but the ones here haunt me with their deliciousness. I haven't tried anything I didn't like. The omeletes are always perfectly prepared. If you want to go here, be aware that the secret is out. Trying to go here on a weekend at 10am will yield a 45 minute wait. And that's because it is worth it. The seasoned potatoes are excellent, as I've had them other places where I did not care for them. Try the red velvet pancakes. I'm not particularly a big fan of red velvet either, but I will order these any day of the week. 
I'm personally impressed when I find a restaurant that makes me like thing I don't ordinarily enjoy. Eat the red velvet pancakes!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I think this may have been the location of my old favorite thai restaurant, Jasmine Thai...tear...but I digress.

It's a small restaurant -- and for 3 on a Saturday morning (11am-ish), the wait was awful.  There's not a big wait area inside and it was too cold to wait outside. Thankfully, we finally got in at the bar counter.

I did the BYO omelette, which is cool cause you can add one of the specialty pancakes for, like, a dollar or two.  I added the lemon ricotta pancakes.  

The omelette was good but I found myself adding a ton of salt and pepper.  The pancakes, however, were awesome!  The cream cheese syrup was SO GOOD.  I literally ate everything off the my plate, scraping off the last bit of the butter, which is rare for me.

Definitely try the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, delicious breakfast food, offering strange and wonderful pancake flavor combinations. The lemon ricotta and cinnabun pancakes were both amazing, and as part of a breakfast combination it was plenty of food for around $10. The bacon was thick and crispy, and the Portuguese sausage was awesome. Seriously, go here."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are the stars of this small cute breakfast and lunch place. They are not too sweet, have great chocolate flavor and super tender. The spinach eggs benedict were also very tasty even though the eggs were a little overcooked. Definitely a must go place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a total of 2 times (and almost a 3rd if I had of stayed today) each time I have came with friends or family the taste and quality of the food has been great. The proportion sizes were nice for the price asked and the restaurant has always smelled great from the good food. 

The complaint I have is each time there has been long wait times you should practically eat before you come. They say right from the start 30 mins to 45 min wait (which is some how a secrete code for an hour plus). I heard great reviews so each time I waited but it always left me with a tinge of angst before eating there. 

The last and final straw for me was today when I was told the 30 to 45 min story from the hostess who to me makes a poor hostess (absolute horrible attitude for paying customers willing to wait an hour) after I wait the entire 45 minutes (I was counting). I asked how much longer before I'm seated (party of 3). She said there are 2 people in front of me. 

After 6 parties are seated before me including 3 different parties of 3 I go to ask what gives. She sharply replies your coming up, internally my wheels are moving and I'm resistant to let this go! I ask her to explain what makes the other parties of 3 any different? She replies out of frustration and ask do I want to put a high chair at a bar. 

Even if that is the case it has been an hour, as my family was being seated we looked at each other and thought we can not spend our money here today or any other day for that matter. Considering we waited an hour to eat just to  leave is a good indication of our level of frustration. Perhaps the hostess should go apply at the post office or DMV where you are not required nor expected to have a bearing on good customer service. 

Sunday is a very relaxing day that I enjoy and I can not spend it at a place that had bad service and good food or vice versa for that matter. I'll pay extra for both they fall short here in the service and wait times.  But I can not discredit the food (every time I have eaten here was delicious) as it is the only reason for the 2 stars."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the Red Velvet pancakes are to die for.  The turkey bacon tasted a bit odd to me but the regular bacon was thick cut and yummy. If you are looking for a quick meal this is not the place to go. The service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Oh man.  My wife and I ordered 3 short stacks of pancakes (Red Velvet, hazelnut, and Cinnabun) and a Piglet Skillet.  The food was amazing, and we ended up taking some of the extra pancakes home for breakfast the next day.  Might have gone overboard on the number of short stacks we got, but it was definitely worth it.

There was a long wait for parties more than 2 or 3, but since it was only my wife and I we got seated right away (got lucky, I guess...).  Only down side was that they were pretty expensive (after tip our bill was almost $40 for breakfast), so this won't be an \"every other week\" place for us, but more of a \"once a month/every 6 weeks\" kind of place for us.

4 Stars for this breakfast establishment.


PS--We would pick this place over IHOP if that is any help in comparison of food quality."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this earlier and I'm very happy that I did. Ordered the corn beef hash (first time in my 34 years of life) and it was so damn good! Upgraded to the garlic rice which was phenomenal and saved the buttermilk pancakes for last, those babies melted in my mouth. Definitely visiting this spot again. Service was fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"So much ado about nothing.

Could over 250 people who raved and ranted about how great Babycakes Café was be sadly mistaken?  You bet your sweet little buns they could!  After reading so many reviews from ecstatic foodies about how fantastic this restaurant was, I braved the over 18 miles drive to Babycakes to get some of their \"famous\" fare.  On a Saturday morning, we waited 50 minutes to be seated.  Hostess Lindy needed some serious lessons in customer service.  She called my name and motioned for me to follow her. She slapped the menu on the table and left without a word. Granting that it was a busy morning, a little courtesy would be much appreciated.  I guess, she was doing us a favor by giving us a seat in this unbelievably busy morning.  Waiter Preston was attentive and cheerful.  He was patient in answering my questions about the dishes and the restaurant operations in general. 

Now on to the food recap.  I had the Portuguese sausage and two over easy eggs, paired with two small red velvet pancakes.  Nothing special with the sausage and eggs, no garnishing at all.  Eggworks' version of this dish was more acceptable. Anyway, really, how could you mess up commercially bought sausage and fried eggs?  The RVP - what's so special about red colored pancakes?  They were fluffy like the way pancakes should be.  The special sauce was simple condensed milk. If anything was added, it was beyond detection.  Verdict:  Entrée was acceptable but nothing exceptional.

Hubby had the in\"famous\" adobe rice.  Since we were told the Filipino owner developed all the recipes, I was hopeful I would be enjoying some nasty good adobo rice.  Since I read the reviews I knew that it would be served wrapped in scrambled egg like an omelet.  Japanese often serve omelets in this fashion so I did not find it strange.  After the first bite, it was clear I was headed for disastrous disappointment. The adobe, which I assumed was pork, was shredded and did not taste anything like Filipino adobo. It looked and tasted like reincarnated kalua pig mixed with soy sauce and nothing else.  What a shame to call this dish \"adobe rice\".  It was clearly a misnomer. Verdict:  Entrée was crap and an utter waste of money.

Conclusion:  There was so much hype about this restaurant.  It was not worth the drive and definitely not worth a second trip."}
{"text":"best breakfast place in Las Vegas .. !! awesome environment!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love ! I have heard so many great things about this place and finally stopped in to try it out! Our waiter was great! Helped us out a lot, we had so many questions about the menu but she was very patient with us. Food was great, pancakes were delicious. I will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"This place just opened up and I gotta say it has really good food. The red velvet pancakes taste like heaven in your mouth. The \"king Joey jalapeño burger is really amazing. I love spicy hot food especially burgers. Breakfast and lunch have a good selection. For the place just opening the service is really good. Babycakes is most def a must try. Also they offer free wi-fi. What!"}
{"text":"Delish! What a gem. The lemon ricotta pancakes tender and huge. Dh an DD both had the sausage biscuits and gravy also yummy. People next to us were fawning all over some red velvet pancakes that looked tasty. Gotta come back and give them a try!"}
{"text":"My gf and I love Babystacks she actually introduced me to it. I was born and raised in Hawaii so going somewhere with local 808 influences are always a plus. 

We basically go to this location because it is the closest to our house. We avoid sitting at the bar  because they tend to forget about you there. Both times we sat there we literally waited 10 minutes just go get drink orders. 

We have had a nice Asian girl (who is pregnant) twice in a row now and she is awesome! I have never had to ask for refils. I wanted kalbi and eggs and she checked to make sure it was ready instead of just telling me no they didn't have it because it is not listed on the menu. 

I usually get the Portuguese sausage and eggs with garlic rice or the chilli moco with Mac salad."}
{"text":"I ordered ahead for pick up the first time I was put on hold for 10 minutes and nobody picked up!!! I hung up and called a second time and finally got some service put my order in and they said it would be about 30-35 minutes!!!! Totally understandable... I live about 20 minutes away anyway showed up and they didn't even put my order in or nothing!!!! It's like they didn't even care or anything!!! Never going back there again!!! Didn't even offer me a free meal or anything for there mess up!!!"}
{"text":"My brother and the rest of my family demand to come here every time they come to Vegas. It's a cut above everywhere else pancake. If they killed some chicken and waffles (hint hint) I'd never go anywhere else for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I loved the food. The cookies and cream stack is outrageous. The service was excellent, even with a party of 8."}
{"text":"Not just small, but crowded! Regardless of how the food is, this is my first and last visit. Small shoud be cozy and not chaotic!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafe's to go to! Food is always amazing and service is phenomenal.  Must try the adobo special and red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"I'll be coming more often! I heard so many good things about this place and I finally decided to come and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! Red velvet pancakes are to die for."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Let me first say that I have gone to the babystacks on buffalo too many times to count and I love it. The food was always exceptional, as was the staff. I didn't like how cramped it was, however, so I was happy when they built this one. So let me tell you why I despise this location. The first time my fiancé and I went here he ordered a coffee that had been forgotten for a good 20 minutes so we had to request another and didn't receive so much as an apology. Then I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes, which I've had many times, without pecans because I am allergic. The waitress said oh okay no problem. Guess what came on top of my pancakes? Yep, you guessed it, pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I  am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing, hospital going allergic. The manager came by to apologize and promise me that my pancakes were being remade and she would supervise. They finally come out after my fiancé was done with his meal. I start eating them, and they are pretty darn good, then I just decide to flip my pancake over and what do I see?!?! Another freaking nut on the bottom of the freaking pancake!!! Are you kidding me?! At this point I'm almost in tears. This is my life, like it's kind of serious. The waiter kind of laughed and took them away again. I'm sorry, is the possibility of me becoming seriously ill or even dying funny to you?! The manager gave me some bs and just kind of danced around it. I don't really know all I heard was wah wah wah. I wasn't just some disgruntled customer who didn't like something. This should have been taken a lot more serious than it was. Needless to say I will never set foot In this building again. Their pancakes are pretty freaking good, but not good enough to be my last meal!!"}
{"text":"visited this place per a friend's recommendation.  it was spacious, bright, and airy.  our waitress was pleasant and very friendly.  

they do specialize in lots o' pancakes, which is awesome.  i had the coveted red velvet pancakes.  maybe my expectations were too high, but the pancakes were really dry, and i couldn't taste any flavor in them, almost like they were stale.  the icing that came with it was unbearably sweet.  i had a better time stealing food off of my bf's kalua pork benedict.

i wouldnt be opposed to coming back and trying out other items, they have quite the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. We had about a 30 min wait (Saturday brunch time) and then the hostess called our name and asked if they counter was ok or if we preferred a table. My husband said \"do you have a table\" and she looked around and said \"uh, no.\" Guess we'll take the counter then! After that the service was good and food came out quickly. I like that the omelets came with pancakes and you have the option to upgrade to one of the crazy flavors. I got the red velvet because of all the reviews and DANG! They were great. They're popular for good reason. The omelet was fine, for some reason they put the cheese on the outside. Whatever. The hash browns were really good, maybe a little soggy but I was into it."}
{"text":"I'm so excited literally never had these feelings about a restaurant before so I apologize if this is frantic. We are waiting for our food now--holy cow it just arrived!! Okay I'm going to eat it now. Stay tuned yelp! Dangggg it looks gr8"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I'd give 100 stars of I could. The food is amazing! The Red velvet pancakes are soooo yummy! The servers are so friendly! Everyone should try at least once."}
{"text":"The pancakes here really are the best! I always come here when I have family or friends In town and it never disappoints. They offer a huge menu so there's something for everyone. They do get busy on the weekends but the staff are always hustling and getting the food out in a timely manner. If you're looking for a unique breakfast spot with amazing food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great food HORRIBLE waiting time!! I seriously don't understand why doesn't the owner spand this location. You literally have to wait 45 minutes to an hour just to get sited, and top of it hostess  sits people in the order they want not as first come first serve."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and there will be a long wait on weekend but it is always worth it. Both their sweet pancake dishes are their savory omelettes, etc. are delicious. This is my favorite breakfast place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Not bad. The Red Velvet pancake was pretty good but, perhaps we've had too much expectations on it. The Portuguese sausage with garlic rice on the side was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Best Red Velvet pancakes. Something about it is just so so good. I've had my fair share of red velvet pancakes, and this place by far makes the best.  I've had a lot of things on their menu and they were all super duper good. A must place to eat for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much! Walking distance from my home. GREAT food with a twist, Spam & eggs very good, pulled pork Benedict outstanding!"}
{"text":"Quality food good selection of pancakes. Have had the bacon pancakes, few breakfast skillets, and there lemon pancakes all have been wonderful."}
{"text":"Really great specialty pancakes and love the authentic (I THINK its authentic, but I am just a silly white girl lol) Hawaiian/Asian food options. The \"Rick's adobo fried rice omelet is one of my favorites and the red velvet pancakes and bananas foster pancakes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok was in Vegas last month rolled in here about 20 minutes to close on Sunday.  I used to wait tables you are a jerk if you do this and stay long after the establishment you are bs'ing in has closed. Now I told my friend we weren't going to be a jerks like that.  Despite us rolling in the girl who took care of us was really cool about it.  I told her upfront we would tip her well.  This is a Vegas must if you don't leave the strip to get here you are missing out big time.  I'm not even going to get into it all's I'm saying is I was impressed and this is a foodie breakfast heaven! Carry your a$$ on over there."}
{"text":"Just tried babystacks cafe and the food was delicious. My daughter kept give  me this look of satisfaction as she eats the cookies and cream pancakes while saying mmmmm soooooooo good. The presentation of the meal was beautiful and the taste was very satisfying for your palet. Also on top of that our server Melanie was very polite and very knowledgeable of the food and gave good recommendations for our meal. On top of that she always had a beautiful smile every time she came to our table which made my meal experience more pleasurable. Then the hostess was polite and very accommodating always letting me know my table status. Overall my visit to babystacks cafe was wonderful and can't wait to come back and with more new customer for them."}
{"text":"I am so happy babystacks opened up on the east side.  I was driving all the way to Durango for those biscuits and red velvet pancakes,  and it was worth it!!  Luckily that's no longer necessary.    Stop by Sunset & Stephanie to enjoy all they have to offer.   Expect a super long wait on the weekends, go before 9."}
{"text":"Amazing Pancakes!
Must try the Bananas Foster, Hazelnut, and the French Toast with the Spread!

Omelettes not that great but then again that's not what they are known for!"}
{"text":"This location is very small and is always packed on the weekends. Our last attempt to eat there had a 35 min wait and quite frankly their food in general isn't good enough for that long of a wait, but if you're a huge pancake fan this is the place to go and may be worth it for you to wait. I'm not a pancake fan but I did try their pancakes on 2 occasions, the carrot cake pancakes come with a cream cheese syrup and was delicious, as is their red velvet pancakes but both are super sweet and are more of a dessert to me than breakfast food. I like this place because it has a Hawaiian fusion menu and is good for a change up in breakfast every once in a while. The loco moco is good but not the best I've had, could of used a bit more gravy. The kalua pig benedict completely lacked flavor and the portuguese sausage is extremely greasy but tasty, Ricks adobo fried rice is just okay, nothing I would ever order again."}
{"text":"My wife and i went to the Babystacks on N. Buffalo. I had the best mexican omelet of my life...covered with a layer of Jack cheese and filled with yumminess. My wife had the red velvet pancakes. They were perfectly sweet. The staff was awesome! They were attentive and genuinely friendly. We'll be going back very soon."}
{"text":"What do you do when you are waiting for a table for two and there are 5 tables of 2 and 3 tables of 4 empty? Well, the explanation was the kitchen was backed up. Not good enough. They still could have seated you and gave you coffee, especially to the customers who were standing. I left, so I can't rate the food."}
{"text":"Always delicious and service is pretty good too. Never have had a bad experience or item that I ordered I didn't love. Definitely a place I recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite breakfast spots. My go-to meal is the chicken adobo omelet, it's a must try! The only downside is that it's small and if you don't come early enough you'll have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"My son begs to come here.... So, it is rare... But when I have time to be alone with just my son, baby stacks is our breakfast date.... He ordered the delicious moist red velvet pancakes and I got an omelette with the most amazing ricotta lemon pancakes.... They used to put more ricotta in them, but still good.... The wait to get in is always long...., but worth it.... Suggestions.... Go back to the original ricotta recipe and have a better coffee selection menu.... See you in my next date with my son...."}
{"text":"Their pancakes are great, especially the red velvet. If you're not a pancake person, their cookie crumble french toast (I think that is what it's called) is just as great as their pancakes, it might be a little too sweet for my taste. The huevos rancheros and seasoned potatoes are good."}
{"text":"Worse service. I walked out!!!  First of all parties before ours were being seated first but it wasn't until we waited 30 min for 1 of party  to get her food while we were waiting still waiting for the rest of the food to arrive.  I noticed people that were just being seated getting their meals when I finally went to front counter to ask what was going on.  I was told by the Hostess it just depends on \"how the kitchen gets the tickets.\" Is that a concern of mine or management?  I guess what really made the situation worse was the lack of care for the situation. Not even an apology after waiting almost an hour without food. Guess the fact that this place has so many customers who cares about upsetting & losing 1 customer.  Since this is not my first bad experience at this restaurant, I certainly will not be back nor will I recommend it to anyone else unless you have hours to spend waiting to be seated, to get your drink order and to finally eat."}
{"text":"Baby stacks is fantastic. I would give them 5 stars but they do not offer fried rice, which is what I'm used to when I'm in Maui. They do have Portuguese sausage and fantastic pancakes, along with many other Hawaiian treats. The service is phenomenal and I've yet to have a bad me on the place."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating to eat breakfast at this place but after having some HAIR strands on my eggs, it just ruined my appetite and my experience. I will never go here ever again or any of their other establishments.  Me and the wife just stood up with disgust facial expressions and excused ourselves, my wife felt bad because she can see that I was really disappointed...."}
{"text":"NOT YOUR TYPICAL BREAKFAST or LUNCH CAFE...

Because we had a huge party of 8 people we were able to order FAMILY STYLE and just pick from an amazing variety of dishes from Babycakes Cafe's delectables!  =P Below is my description of the following items...

-**Red Velvet Pancakes
-**Cinnamon Bun Pancakes
-Country Fried Steak & Eggs
-**Kalua Pigs Benedict
-**Honey Toast
-**Wheat French Toast
-Rick's Adobe Fried Rice 

(I added an \"**\" by the items that I've never had before and were special.)

So let me just describe how our meal went down...

From the light texture of the Red Velvet p-cakes and the full and savory flavor of the airy homemade whipped cream (Never had anything like it! I don't like whipped cream, but I really like this one...A LOT!)  that accompanied it, to the special of the month (at the time that I went June 2011) - Cinnamon Bun Pancakes (Whoa!), HOMEY Country Fried Steak and Eggs, the Kalua Pig Benedict (which was my FAVORITE!!!! If you like the smokey flavor, then get this! I've had salmon eggs benedict before, but the flavor of this thing just BURSTS forth like no other.) We also got the Honey Toast AND the Wheat French Toast. Both HIGHLY recommended. If you LOVE HONEY then get the Honey Toast, and if you really love cinnamon and the whipped cream from here AND a crunchy texture, get the Wheat French Toast. See, the Wheat French toast had \"cereal bits\" built into the bread that added an extra level of crunchiness, yum yum! Rick's Adobe Fried Rice was also on our table and was devoured within a few minutes.

These are just some of the things we ordered which were definitely NOT your typical breakfast/lunch items (except country fried steak and eggs). If Babycakes Cafe were located in my neighborhood back home I'd definitely be a regular. =D"}
{"text":"oh my goodness...i think this has to be one of the best breakfast places i've ever been to...ever...and definitely the best in las vegas...so far each time i've been the food has been excellent...have yet to try the red velvet pancakes...just so many good things on the menu it's hard to decide...and the staff is super sweet!!!  can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is overated, told them service was bad, lousy food was cold, manager came over and was just as rude as server, if you don't want complaints do it rite, the first time. If you want a great meal go to the egg and I or cracked egg where they care about there customers and feed back. To big for there bridges horrible food, horrible service, horrible managment!!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best variety of specialty pancakes in Vegas!  
We have tried just about all the pancake options, and find the Red velvet, bananas foster, and the cookies and cream are our favorites. 
Eggs are always great, hash browns over the seasoned potatoes, if you don't want all the excess salt etc. 
Service has always been friendly, fast, and accommodating.  Good prices"}
{"text":"Don't know what the fuss is about here. Breakfast with co-worker and it was ok, not delivered hot and was very bland. Server was very good though."}
{"text":"If you really want to grab breakfast I was just going to this place. But I would suggest just get the pancakes because they are the star of the show. The eggs are good but not great compare to the greatest of the pancakes. Family friendly as well. The nice warm atmosphere. I definitely will be returning to enjoy more pancakes very soon."}
{"text":"A little disappointed, definitely didn't live up to the hype. Service was absolutely perfect, 5 stars for service. But food was just ok. I actually didnt like the pancakes they had a weird bitter taste to the batter and the banana flavor tasted artificial. I had the lemon ricotta before and didn't care much for those either. 1 star for coffee. Worst cup of coffee I've had in years. The awesome waitress brought me a fresh cup and it was still disgusting. How can you be a breakfast place and have gross coffee?"}
{"text":"You know you're a true foodie when you look for the best restaurant for a particular dish, and this place does Red Velvet Pancakes THEE BEST. EVER. The cream cheese frosting it comes with is literally the icing on the cake ;) a MUST order for sure!

Also, the cookie butter French toast is amazing. How could anything cookie butter not be amazing?! GET IT!

The white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were alright. And the kalua grilled cheese wasn't as flavorful as we were hoping. And the steak and eggs were standard. 

Seems like the breakfast entrees are pretty regular but I can't wait to try some of the other pancakes! This place gets 4 stars because the red velvet pancakes and cookie butter French toast are out of this world delicious! And the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes, adobo rice, oh so good, it's like orgasm in my mouth. Small place but food is YUM! The food is great but the hosts are not doing well with their tasks. It's annoying to wait in line to be seated only to see 3-5 empty tables empty. Come on! Why don't you sit them right away so they can at least look at the menu. It only takes a minute to ask for their drinks while you guys wait for a server to become available. This establishment could accommodate more people if they are efficient. Sorry I've been here few times and that's always the case. If only their good is not good, I wouldn't bother coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and visit here often. The service is always fast and friendly. You can't go wrong when you order their red velvet pancakes, the best you'll ever have! If you don't have a sweet tooth they also have amazing skillets, my personal fav is the babychick."}
{"text":"Large portions not huge, which is good.  Portugese sausage, hash browns, and eggs was what I ordered, it also came with a small stack of buttermilk pancakes.  Hashbrowns were good.  Crispy on the outside and cooked through.  Yolks were nice and runny.  Portugese sausage was, meh.  Not Purity so, oh well.  Pancakes had good flavor but were a bit gummy not \"light and fluffy\".  Gravy from the chicken fried steak could have stood a little more cook time as it still had that flour taste.  The steak part though had nice flavor and was tender.  The red velvet pancakes, which I tried, was meh.  If they improved the texture of their pancakes it would be a really winner.  We'll see."}
{"text":"I would honesty go here every morning for breakfast if it wasn't so crowded but it is so worth the wait !! This place is so yummy"}
{"text":"I had found BabyStacks on Yelp and wanted
To eat there on my recent Vegas trip. I know it's off the strip but I knew we could take a lyft or uber there. However sleeping in everyday was not going to get me there. Since today we are catching a flight to Oakland, I decided we could eat there in the morning. I ordered the Banana Cream Pie pancakes and they were delicious. I could have used some more whipped cream but they were really good. I also ordered a side of hash browns and omg there aren't words to express how good they were. The hash browns were the perfect combination of being crispy and soft without being burnt or undercooked. If we weren't in a time crunch for our flight,I would have ate a lot more. Hope to come back again!"}
{"text":"Found this place today and decided to give it a try since it had pretty good reviews... Very impressed!!! Great variety of foods and great service!!! Loved it!! Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"I wish I could live even closer and I'm only about 3 minutes away! This place is amazing. I'm a big coffee drinker and even their coffee is good. This time I tried the carrot cake pancakes and they were delightful! My partner had some French toast nutella and honey butter thing and I didn't know if I should trade or just eat BOTH!"}

And that is pretty much what it looked like. Unappetizing and bland, it wasn't worth the $10 I paid. With all the 4 and 5 star ratings I see here, I must have caught this cafe on a bad day. But no excuses allowed.

A place better avoided."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very accommodating. Cute open place. I had the kalua pork benedict, it was different and delish. 

They also have a good kids menu, although the chicken tenders could be more bite size for younger kids

Overall it was good."}
{"text":"First of all, the atmosphere is very inviting and welcoming, especially on a hungry morning. I ordered a orange juice, but it was pretty bitter so I asked to switch it out for an apple juice, which the waitress happily did. For my meal, I had a build-it-your-own omelette, with cheddar, chicken, tomatoes and green onions. It was kinda dry, and had a little less chicken than I expected, but the hash browns it came with were pretty on point. The pancakes it also came with were also hella bomb, so next time I'll try a pancake item. If you're into fruit, the strawberries were juicy and ripe.
All and all, it was a pretty positive experience. The waiters could be a little more attentive, but I'd give it a whirl if you're in the area, looking for a good breakfast, and it's not the weekend, because then you'll be waitin a helluva long time, ya dig."}
{"text":"I had a great time there with my co workers while waiting for our meal. The food was great. I want to go back."}
{"text":"It was nice to find a Hawaiian cafe in the area. I go to Hawaii quite often since my bf resides there so I was stoked to find a place to feed my Hawaiian food cravings in Henderson/ Vegas area. Service here was superb. The workers were absolutely sweet and accommodating. Food was great-- as if I were enjoying meal in Hawaii. Lol.

Btw, their red velvet pancakes are to die for. So fluffy and flavorful! I highly recommend ordering it."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes are really good. Not too sweet, fluffy like pancakes should be. My parents got spam and eggs with garlic rice. They liked it. The adobe fried rice looked tempting too. Good menu selections. Service is fast. Came here on a weekday and there was no crowd."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the food is always delicious. You can tell by the morning rush they get. Great customer service. I was greeted by Echo who was very friendly and was fast in accommodating my party of 5. There Red velvet pancakes are the most popular, and I can see why. My server Cassandra was also speedy and kept the coffee coming. This place is great! I will definitly be back."}
{"text":"The overall appearance left much to be desired but the food and service were exceptional! Carlos took great care of us!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were BOMB! This place is small and you will probably need to wait a while for a table, but it's sooooo worth the wait. Definitely will go back!!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there.  Awesome food and service.  Looking forward to going again.  We went on a Saturday around 1:00pm.  I am guessing there may be a wait for peek breakfast times."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here Saturday. Walked in about 8:45, still lots of tables free. But by 9:15 the place was jamming and folks waiting for tables. Server was prompt & friendly.  
   We did not have to wait long for the short stack strawberry pancakes and lemon pancakes. Great light textures and flavors.  Twice our coffee was just warm but the third time was just right. This was our first visit and we are coming back for sure!  Anxious to try crepes and some other items.  The menu has several varieties of pancakes and egg dishes, including the chocolate chip pancakes I plan on trying soon.  
   My only complaint was acoustics....it was so loud conversation was hard to carry on."}
{"text":"It is hit or miss with this place. Sometimes I get really good pancakes, other times not so much. I usually order the peanut butter and banana pancakes. Sometimes there is peanut butter in them, other times there is not. The red velvet everybody raves about is good. Pretty sweet. It is like you are eating dessert for breakfast. I think they definitely need to get a bigger space. The line can be really long. Quick service is a plus. I will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff!
Clean environment!
And YUMMY food! I will definitely come back to this location!"}
{"text":"I found Babystacks on Yelp and after reading the reviews and drooling at the photos, my friend Alana and I decided to head over there to experience the hype.
The restaurant is pretty tight, as in it was a little small. We arrived around lunch time so there was a good amount of people when we arrived. We were seated, however, right away which definitely deserves an A+. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive the entire time. Food came out pretty quick so A+ for that as well.
On to the food... first the red velvet pancakes.. was I expecting red velvety battered goodness? Yes. Did I get it? No. They were pretty much pancakes with red food coloring topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with mini chocolate chips. Nothing mind blowing. The cream cheese syrup tasted like the icing you would find in a store bought cinnaroll can. Once again, nothing special. For me, total fail to the excitement I had before I actually tasted them.
Now on to the saviour of this review... the adobo omellett. It was a hefty size. I was expecting more egg than filling but thankfully I was wrong. It was chockful of yummyness! The rice tossed with the adobo sauce and shredded chicken were delightful for my taste buds. The creamy side Mac salad was a great addition to the dish.
All in all I had an ok experience. I chose 3 stars based on the fact that I was expecting to have my taste buds blown away... but all I got was a fizzle. Maybe red velvet TASTING pancakes are like the loch ness monster... just a myth."}
{"text":"I like this littl restaurant!!! I recommend it!
If you love pancakes this is the perfect place!! Good prices! I been wanting to go everyday!! Hahaha
So if you're in las vegas stop by! Located on stephanie and sunset"}
{"text":"Long Wait? Why not looks like a cool spot packed w cool people.
Fourty minutes crammed into a cashier section to taste some nasty ass artificial butter spray in the pancakes or artificial sweetener- 
Lemon ricotta pancakes? Sounds AMAZING LIGHT & Fluffy.. Got greasy thin pancakes that tasted like Duncan Hines lemon cake batter thinned out to form a pancake- artificial tasting nastiness- RICOTTA? Wha? No visible traces of such an ingredient??
Sons chocolate chip pancakes looked great tasted like fake butter & sweet & low-
Hmf omelette.. First ingredient seasoned sausage? More like the fool in the kitchen got a bit excited using a gang of cilantro & green onion w hard to find \"sausage\" -omelette dry as f*ck
Bathroom out of order made it all even better
No espresso - am I wrong to need it?"}
{"text":"The food is always great and the service is great as well.  The only reason I cannot give five stars is every time we stop in for breakfast we get stuck by the massive sun blinding windows.  The window tint does little to help and this could easily be fixed for a small investment.   We love this place but look else where at times because of the deadly sun.  Please fix this buy some shades for the windows.  I bet the money you save in a/c would pay for the shades in a few short sunny months."}
{"text":"The food and plate for breakfast was warm at best. The server apologized and replaced with a hotmeal. The other people in the party were done while I was still eating! I will never go back there! This was not my first cold plate there."}
{"text":"The food is a-ma-zinggggg. The Red Velvet pancakes & cinnamon bun pancakes will keep you coming back. The Skinny chick was quite a delightful omelet however I think I garlic overload by the time I finished it and I love garlic so that says a lot.

I was glad to experience this place on a weekday when there isn't a 3 hour wait. The restaurant is small so it is a little awkward that you can see everything from the runner station especially if you sit right by it. Food execution is great & the service is good so I give it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes. They really sucked because 1) I found a hair in it. GROSS. 2) They pretty much consisted of buttermilk pancakes topped with a couple of white chocolate chips. According to the menu, there's supposed to be white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts in the batter, but there definitely were not. Pretty disappointing/disgusting experience."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes and kalua pork eggs Benedict.  That's the recommendation.  Excellent."}
{"text":"BY FAR the best pancakes I've ever had! 

As I'm not a huge pancake person, its hard to find one I love. And I LOVED the Orange Creamsicle pancakes. They were delicious. The coffee and hashbrowns were also great.

I wish I knew our waitresses name (she was smiley and wore glasses) because she was the friendliest person we met in Vegas! 

I would definitely recommend getting off the beaten path a little and visiting BabyStacks!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Wait was long. Their coffee is great! But the pancakes were mediocre. Red velvet pancakes were just regular pancakes with food dye and chocolate chips. The cinnamon roll pancakes were regular pancakes with a pinch of cinnamon sugar on top and (what tasted like) dominos cinnastix icing drizzled on top. The hash brown were a little mushy and bland. The place is pretty clean. Very noisy. Overall I could have made a better breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I had the red velvet pancakes with a side of turkey bacon, my husband had the smore pancakes and my in-laws had some omelets and the carrot cake pancakes.  The reason for coming here was the different types of pancakes...we were all satisfied!  The cream cheese syrup was amazing.
We'd highly recommend coming here, but try to get there a little early.  We arrived about 8:30 and were seated right away, but on the way out there were some people waited to get a seat."}
{"text":"Has the ranchero omelette and it was awesome!! The wife had the country fried steak and was one of the best I've had. Will be back"}
{"text":"Put us in a corner and lots of unhappy looking employees. Our waitress is the only person that's smiling.  Ordered the fried rice with side order of red velvet pancakes and hash browns. They also serve Pepsi here so I ordered a strawberry lemonade which is bleh."}
{"text":"My wife liked it but I was certainly not impressed with the service. We went there twice and it never got better. Long wait and longer wait for your food which was mediocre. How hard is it to make eggs and pancakes? When My wife suggests going there again I always suggest that the service is better at Ihop, and so it the food."}
{"text":"I had a friend recommend this place the next time I went to Vegas and I am so glad I did.  My wife had the red velvet, my daughter had the carrot cake pancakes.  I had the Huntington omelette.  We shared off of each others plates.  I truly feel this was the best breakfast ever.  The restaurant is small and there can be a wait.  We went at around 10:30am on a Thursday and just missed a rush.  It was the perfect meal before heading back to SoCal."}
{"text":"I recently went to this location and seeing there was room at the counter, asked if my wife and I could sit there.  The hostess told us to wait until she could check to see if anyone else wanted to sit there first.  She then got busy taking care of customers paying their checks, then seating guests at tables but ignoring us.  No one else was seated at the counter.  After many minutes of being ignored, we left.  This hostess never smiled or appeared gracious towards customers, whether taking their names for the waiting list for taking payments. Definitely not good customer service!"}
{"text":"Feels like a nice home cooked meal. Everyone was real friendly. Food is affordable and their selection is bigger than normal. Definitely a place to try if you live in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"The cinnabon pancakes are off the hook son! My family loves this place. Go early to avoid the looooong wait. This place gets stupid busy on the weekend."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I was blazed but the red velvet pancakes are one of the best things I've ever had in my life. Everything else we ordered was good too. Prob the only \"casual\" breakfast spot ive been to in vegas that actually made over-medium eggs the way i like- No runny whites (yuck) Highly recommend! Seating isn't very cozy but it works.."}
{"text":"We had a mediocre visit.  On my first visit, the coffee was weak. It took longer than usual to get our coffee and water.  The banana pancakes did not have a robust flavor.  My husband liked his omelette.  The cafe is loud because it is an open room. Our experience was just 'meh'.  However, I would go back again to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Loved this place and would definitely go back for more! Tried the cinabbun pancakes, and classic eggs benedict, which was really good! Others in my group ordered the red velvet pancakes, spam scramble, cookie butter french toast, adobo omelette, which i got to try a bite of each. It was so good to the point the we ordered to go and brought it back home to california! The wait wasn't long, and service was not bad at all."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! From out of town so wanted to try a local spot and this place did not disappoint. The pork eggs benedict and banana pancakes were delicious! Only downside was the long wait to get seated."}
{"text":"BabyStacks is like IHOP on Zippy's.  The Portuguese sausage is perfect.  Lots of good local dishes, and lots of Aloha."}
{"text":"A-mazing pancakes. I'm pretty sure we were eating red velvet cake for breakfast. They have over 15 unique flavors of pancakes and I look forward to going back and working my way down the line up. My husband got the mexican omelet and it was also delicious. There is a reason there's a wait to eat here. 

Our server, Jacob, was super. Service with a smile and some friendly banter. Our coffee cups were never empty."}
{"text":"Finally I made it to Babycakes Cafe, and I want to kick myself for letting it take so long. It was delicious!! I love the location because its not too far from me, the service was excellent, and the restaurant itself was super cute!

I had a short stack of the red velvet pancakes, and they were simply put PERFECT! They were just enough to satisfy the pancake/desert craving I was having. I also tried the bacon pancakes and they were great as well. Then last I had the zesty chicken omelette and Oh my it was super tastey!!! All in all one of the best eating experiences ever and I will be returning soon Most Definitely!!"}
{"text":"Quick, inexpensive, delicious breakfast!! They have plenty to choose from and the portions are generous. Location and parking are convenient!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service. Babystacks pancakes are absolutely delicious, I think tried most if not all ;). Loco moco and corned beef hash are my favorite. 

A little patience especially during the weekends will go a long way, they can get very busy. It is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there last week and oh my gosh the Cinnabun pancakes were so good! My boyfriend got the hazelnut pancakes that weren't as delicious but still just as yummy. Deff go!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on Friday, Veterans Day, 11/11/2016. The restaurant was very busy but the host seated us within 15 minutes of arrival. Our waitress was really good and give her a 4+ stars.  The food....taste--2: the Lola's Adobo Fried Rice had taste --better than the Sunset Location; but still lacked the filipino Adobo flavor.  I ordered the corned beef--total disappointments I don't recommend anyone to order! My nephew ordered the loco moco; it was ok but the gravy was salty. I recommend the cooks watch the heavy hand, let us add more salt I'd needed too!"}
{"text":"Great pancakes.The downside is that their traditional egg breakfasts are really sub par. Also a bit pricey for breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my \"thing\" and I struggle to find great breakfast spots in area neighborhoods. Heard about Babycakes a while back and finally tried it this morning with another breakfast lover. The menu is phenomenal. I'd go back with a large group - preferably after running a marathon so I could indulge guilt-free! This is a breakfast and lunch place but I was all about breakfast.  The menu featured any kind of egg item imaginable - many omelettes. Eggs benny. Etc.  And this place is a carb lover's dream come true. Pancakes. Waffles. Crepes. Combos. I tried an egg combo with poached eggs and turkey bacon so I could enjoy bites of two different types of pancakes - banana and also peanut butter. (Go with someone you feel very comfortable with so you can share and sample, as I did today.)   The peanut butter pancakes (studded w/chocolate chips) were outstanding. So good that I was content after a few delicious bites. I'd love to try the cinnamon bun pancakes (a special this week) or the mac nut pancakes. The menu also featured carrot cake pancakes, s'mores, lemon ricotta and many others.  Side items include everything imaginable plus some more unusual items, like garlic fried rice. The eggs benny varieties were also impressive!  Kalua pig eggs benny, for example. Loved the inventive and affordable kids menu , which features a grilled PB&J.  This places gets really busy on weekends so trying it for the first time during the week is a good idea.  Was worried the hightop tables would be uncomfortable but the leather barstools were great - they also had some lower tables.  I loved that the combos are so inventive and that the menu was so extensive."}
{"text":"There's always a wait bc it't so good.  The nutella crepe and red velvet pancakes are the best!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I don't get the hype about this place. I read the yelp reviews and got excited because it's close to where I live and I've been looking for a really great and convenient breakfast spot... but after my two experiences here, I will never go back. Even if it was across the street from my house and offered free breakfast, I would never ever go back. It is that disgusting. 

How do you mess up any egg dish? That blows my mind. I had a denver omelet and it was mostly egg, hardly any cheese or peppers, and just had maybe 10 ity-bity bits of ham. Other than the loud-mouthed waitress who had no manners, what I noticed the most from this visit were the cheap crappy plates and tableware. Never seen anything so cheap in any restaurant ever in my life. I felt dirty using them.

On the second visit (yes, I stupidly gave it a second shot), I had steak and rice, and both were absolutely inedible. HOW DO YOU F UP RICE?!! The rice was hard and dry. The steak was like the meat I would imagine you would get in prison. It was tiny, round, and charred to the point where all you could taste is charcoal. The meat was so hard that the cheap flimsy fork wouldn't penetrate it. 

But that's not the disgusting part. 

I reached for the steak sauce so I could try to choke this charred crap down and nearly dropped the bottle. The bottle looked like it's been used and refilled for at least five years without being cleaned in any way. The opening of the bottle was so clogged with nasty, crusty old sauce, I'm sure the sauce that was left in there would only trickle out. Not that I wanted to use it after seeing that. Then I reach for my straw to drink the nasty water and the straw was stained with what looked like blood O_O. I quickly dropped that too, completely appalled. I waved the waitress down to get another straw, and she grabs another from her dirty apron and throws it on the table and guess what?... it's stained and crusty looking too! 

At that point I decide I'm done. I didn't eat, didn't drink and I just wanted to run out of there as fast as I could. I grabbed my stuff and paid and got the hell out of there. I didn't raise hell or demand to speak to a manager because... how do you tell someone everything about their establishment is repulsive and they should be shut-down. I'd be embarrassed to even have to say that to a place of business. They should be ashamed. Yelpers beware."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, unlike anything we have had before. Fresh food, friendly fast service. And not a far drive from the strip, and good price."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Banana fosters is da bomb!  My only complaint is that the place is too small so it doesn't take many patrons to create a long waiting list."}
{"text":"Had to visit this place just because of the red velvet pancakes. My buddy and I thought to share red velvet pancake while we ate other dishes we ordered off the menu and it was amazing. Thought it would be too sweet but NAH IT WAS AMAZING, not too sweet but juuuuusst right. How genius to make a cake into a flat pancake form."}
{"text":"Nice original breakfast place in Summerlin. Pancakes were great. I had the lemon ricotta (light with delicious lemon cream sauce) and my son had the chocolate chip (lots of chips). The egg skillets we had were okay, not great. On the dry side. I'd come back for the pancakes next time were in Summerlin."}
{"text":"the food is amazing but i am mainly writing this about one of the hostesses they have working the front. 

We came in yesterday (sunday 3/18) around 10 of course it was packed, we were greeted by 2 hostesses, 1 of which didn't really smile at all, the other had a huge smile on her face, she was the cashier, her name was Jordan. Cashing people out wasn't the only thing she was doing, i saw her running food, bussing tables, seating people and cashing them out. If you want a hostess she's one to have on your team, she was amazing, and i didn't see a flaw at all in her work, i'm sure there was and if there was i never saw. 

we've come in a few times and have been greeted by her and i just think she's great. never rude, always has a smile on her face, friendly. she's someone they DEF need to have out serving people."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Red velvet pancakes were the best pancakes ever. The lemon ricotta pancakes were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Ya know, this was my favorite place in Vegas until today. We are frequent customers but I won't be back to this location after the way I was treated today. My husband and I are celebrating our 15th anniversary and this is where I wanted to go for lunch. I ordered my usual, rocky road pancakes. When they came, they weren't right. They had chocolate chips on them instead of the normal marshmallows. I sent it back and was sure to be nice to the server...after all, it wasn't his fault. 25 mins later, I STILL hadn't gotten my pancakes. My husband had eaten his entire meal while I sat there and watched numerous tables get their orders. I've worked in restaurants, the common practice is to fix a customer's order before working on new orders. I complained to the manager and all she could say was \"there's a health inspector here and she's not letting us work.\" Really? Because other people have gotten their food, no problem. Then she offered to take it off my bill. Gee, how generous of you...SINCE I NEVER EVEN GOT THE FOOD! I walked out extremely pissed and will not be back"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding! I eat so much Im having a hard time breathing! And its totally worth it! 
  I wish they would open one in LA"}
{"text":"Customer service was phenomenal. We got banana foster French toast which had a great sauce except for the whip cream which was gross. Got carrot cake pancakes, very dry. Also got Cinnabon pancakes, they were good."}
{"text":"We walked in the morning and were immediately sat. The service is amazing! Austin was very attentive and quick. We ordered the Mexican skillet and Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice! Absolutely amazing and will be back for more! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered a skillet with rocky road pancakes. Bombdotcom. I will return to try their bananas and cream pancakes. Friendly customer service. No complaints."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!! By far my favorite breakfast joint. My husband and I love getting any of the babystack pancakes of all flavors. I get the Mexican scrambled egg dish and it's so good. The nice thing is it's the same at every location. I've always loved the staff as well."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast. Beware: come here early, or you will have to wait a long time. It's hard to find mom and pop shops like these nowadays. It's a little far from the main strip of vegas, but it's mainly freeway driving, so it wasn't that bad of a drive. Probably took us about 15-20min to drive from Mandalay Bay to the restaurant. 

They are known to have really good pancakes...and they are! 
I had the red velvet pancakes and they were delicious. I recommend this one. We didn't get to try the other ones, but there were some that sounded really good. 
My boyfriend got the kalua benedict. He wasn't a fan. 
We recommend going there to eat the pancakes."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a drive from the strip if you're visiting, but worth the drive for those delicious red velvet pancakes. Also had Cinnabun pancakes; red velvet better.  Small dining room meant a wait for three of us.  Parties of two were seated almost instantly."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Went here with my roommates and we loved it!!! I got the strawberry lemonade pancakes w/ a side of Portuguese sausage and it was delicious. The pancakes had the essence of strawberry lemonade so it was not overpoweringly sweet or tart. Paired perfectly with the cream cheese syrup. They were cooked perfect (fluffy but with a cake like texture).Everything we had tasted FRESH. Great service as well. Thank you Valerie! We will be back."}
{"text":"Have not eaten here and wouldn't. Walked in early on a Sunday morning and had to exit as quickly as we entered. There was plenty of seating available but the odor of grease was so nauseating we had to leave. My husband kept smelling his clothes hoping the odor hadn't stuck to him."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Fast and super sweet waitress. Food was amazing! We got the build your own omelet and Mexican skillet. Fantastic! Upgrade your short stack to one of the amazing choices. We got banana and bacon and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Can we say delicious?!  There isn't one thing I've had here that I haven't liked. The garlic rice taste just like my mother-in-laws and that is my favorite anytime of the day. 
The locations are a little small but the wait is never too long. Recently opened location by my house is convenient but I would go to any of them just to get a taste of heavenly goodness."}
{"text":"Great food, great options and great service. We were heading out back home and finally came across a great brunch spot! Thank goodness for this place! We had the huntington omelette and the ranchero omelette they were perfect. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is delicious. Its a ma and pop feel. Great service. Every person so far has been very nice and quick."}
{"text":"This location is quite busy but we were able to get in without a long wait. Service was fast, friendly and attentive. Very large menu selection, maybe flip a coin to help you decide."}
{"text":"Portuguese Fried Rice with the eggs over east is a must have! Hazelnut pancakes are perfect. The fluffiness of the pancakes are so good."}
{"text":"Yup the Adobo fried rice and red velvet pancake delivered. Both were so good!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hideaway spots for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I probably past this place on several occasions without thinking twice.  They got all types of pancakes from red velvet to carrot cake.  My favorite thing to order has to be kalua pig eggs benedict because I'm a sucker oozy eggs and salty pork.  This place is small so expect a wait up to 35 minutes at least!"}
{"text":"Every Sunday there's always a long wait (20-30 mins) so we always opt to go elsewhere... This time we stayed and it was so worth the wait!!!!! The service was fast and the food delicious. Our server remembered exactly what we ordered and how and didn't forget a special request. 

I had the Loco Moco which was superb! Only change I would made would be to have 2 egg yolks because I love over easy eggs and the yolk mixed with the rice. If you're not big on gravy, ask for it on the side although it's delicious! 

Had the German chocolate pancakes- so sweet, chocolatey and yummy. Paired with chocolate milk :P"}
{"text":"Very good food. I had the loco moco it has  rice, beef patty, egg and gravey. All of it very, very good. And don't pass up the red velvet pancakes. Come hungry and leave full. :)"}
{"text":"best adobo fried rice in town!! good service by Valerie and others....great food esp the rice parts ..hahah"}
{"text":"Food's OK.  The staff wasn't that attentive, often the employees would huddle up and talk among their peers and forget about customer service all together.  When you try getting the waiters attention. They have this smirk on their face like they don't want to be bothered look.  If you the employee is or was having a bad day, then please don't pass that negative energy onto the customers."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I had a great visit here I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and when I took my first bite I heard Angeles singing!  Yes they are that good, lemony creamy goodness in every bite.  My husband had the egg breakfast with spam he was doing the happy dance. The waitress was very helpful and friendly sorry I forgot your name or I would have given you a shout out.  The hubby also got a side of pancakes Instead of the potatoes which were light and fluffy (cinnamon bun pancakes) and cooked to perfection. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This BabyStacks is my favorite one in town. The wait always seems shorter, the food is always on point, and the service is always quick. I've never run into any issues with them."}
{"text":"I have been to this Babystacks two times now. I assumed that my first time coming was a fluke and that maybe they were understaffed that day, but today I returned to find exactly the same scenario.

When we (party of 2) arrived, there was only one person at the front counter ringing people out and no host/hostess. We stood there for about 2 minutes until another patron walked in front of us and signed herself on the sheet. As she was finishing up, someone else walked up and took our names down. We asked if the counter was first-come, first-serve or if you also had to wait for that. The host told us he had to ask the other parties on the list wanted the seats or not first. He never asked anyone and the seats remained empty, along with several other empty 2-person tables. About 10 minutes into our wait, a group of 3 guys came in and sat themselves at the counter. Nobody stopped them or even glanced their way. 

When we finally got seated, they seated us and the party before us, which was also a group of 2, in two separate 4-seater tables. There were at least two smaller tables on the other side of the restaurant, and I am certain they were already cleaned, because we watched them clean them. Why seat us in the bigger tables and perpetuate the incredibly long wait this place always seems to have?

The only saving grace of this place is the quality of the food. It is very good. If it wasn't, nobody would wait as long as you have to at this place. However, they need to make some serious changes to the way they send out orders. 

When we finally got our food, about 20 minutes after we ordered, neither of our sides were included. They were going to be a few extra minutes. After we had both completed our main breakfast, still no sides. I got chocolate chip pancakes (which are just chocolate chips on TOP of pancakes, by the way) and the other person got toast. When they finally came out, the toast had definitely been sitting out. The first time I came, the situation was exactly the same, but the waiter had apologized and said the kitchen was behind. Understandable, but apparently their kitchen is ALWAYS behind. They seem to need more staff.  

All the while, I never got a refill. The table behind us was seated after us, had their order taken before us, had paid, left, and been reseated well before we were able to leave. 

This location really needs to learn how to manage their volume. It's never NOT busy. They need to staff accordingly. 

Speaking of staff, everyone is very friendly and nice, but it's not enough to make me want to go back when there's Rachel's Kitchen in the same parking lot and a plethora of other breakfast joints just 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"The menu itself is no joke and neither is their food! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and these guys nail it. Probably my favorite place in Vegas to serve eggs benedict. The price is a little higher than average but the kind service makes up for it. The place is a tad bit small so may feel crammed at times with the layout. All in all if you're an early riser go check this spot out!"}
{"text":"We live super close to babystacks so this is our go-to place for breakfast. Service is always super nice and the food is always amazing. There is often a wait, even during the week, but it's never too long. The place isn't huge but it's so worth the wait. I always get the Kalua pig Benedict and last time I went I swapped out the English muffins for Hawaiian sweet rolls and that was one of the best decisions of my life. Seriously tasty. All them pancakes are good, so it's their Portuguese sausage. We go often and love being regulars. A must go to place for off the strip breakfast. Love all the Hawaiian options here. My kids kids love the s'mores pancakes and the special pineapple pancakes are my fave when they have them available."}
{"text":"Great pancakes and everything is pretty good. Servers are always nice and on point. The wait is a little crazy on weekends, so be ready to wait an hour or so."}
{"text":"Disappointed....we sat before a party of 7, they received their food before us. (There were 3 ppl in our party)We waited 35 minutes for our food and when I received my Benedict it came with HAIR in it!!!! The waitress brought me a new one as fast as she could but, No manager came AND I had to pay for it. I heard great things about this place.....I was so bummed I didn't feel the same way."}
{"text":"This place is great. The specialty items are really creative and tasty. I love the carrot cake pancakes. They taste like a mild carrot cake and they come with cream cheese syrup. The french toast and crepes are also good. The regular breakfast items, like omelets and eggs, are like an average breakfast place. My only complaint about Babycakes is the wait. I have pulled into the parking lot and left as many times as I have been in to eat. They are almost always busy, which is a great thing for them and a good sign of the food. Just go with having a 15-20 minute wait in mind. It is well worth it."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Sooooo good. Hubby and I took the kiddies and we all got something different and there wasn't a bad bite in the bunch. Seriously, red velvet pancakes are to die for. I am drooling now just thinking about it. PANCAKES PLEASE!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 4 times and 3 of the experiences today were poor. Seems as though they take no pride in their work. I ordered a club sandwich with avocado today and the avocado that was put on the sandwich was completely brown and foul. I was so shocked that I asked the waitress why anyone would even consider put something like this on someone's food...it made no sense to me. She did offer to have it remade but I didn't have the time or desire and just left."}
{"text":"Great pancakes !  The pancakes come with all your eggs and the service is quick and friendly.  Such a great find for those traveling through town.   I had the hashbrowns with the sausage links and banana pancakes and eggs.  I wish we had this place in California."}
{"text":"So in love with their red velvet pancakes!!!!!!! Breakfast heaven for sure!!!! Go! This is a place I would take everyone I know for breakfast never disappoints!"}
{"text":"My only issue with this place is that it is quite hot in the restaurant and the service was a tad bit slow. But the food is worth it"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a short wait, but we didn't mind because we have heard great things about this place. All of the food on the menu looked great. My husband I ordered omelets and pancakes. When we got our food, my omelet was not correct. I asked for no peppers. I flagged down our server and let her know what was wrong. She immediately ran to the back and within 5-10 minutes I had a new omelet. I didn't mind waiting because the omelet was great! The only negative part of our experience here was cashing out. We were at the register for a little over 5 minutes before we got cashed out. The host told us it would be a minute, but it took a lot longer than we expected. Overall, we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Babystacks was amazing. Friendly and helpful staff, delicious food, reasonable prices! Ate there and loved the food so much that i ordered a separate to-go order for later! Highly recommend everything! Friends and i had the: lemon ricotta pancakes, red velvet panckes and hazelnut pancakes. Cream cheese syrup is awesome! Also had the loco moco and adobo fried rice stuffed in an omelet. Are you drooling yet? Yum!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is amazing !!!. The Red Velvet Pancakes are to die for. They give you a cream cheese syrup for it. This is a must go to place.  Be prepared for a wait as it is a small place but so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Another regular breakfast spot for us. Tasty tasty pancakes with oodles of options. Great for pancakes and simple breakfast items. Only concern is that at times service can be a little slow."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back to Baby Stacks!! I decided to stop in for breakfast with my best friend that is visiting from out of town. We both agreed that this is a great place for breakfast! The pancakes were honestly some of the tastiest pancakes I've ever had. I ordered the hazelnut short stack with strawberries...wow! They drizzle Nutella with whipped cream and chopped hazelnuts on top! Plus the fresh strawberries made it even better! Every single bite was delicious..I actually finished the short stack! I don't think I could ever order a full order though! A short stack is perfect! I ended up ordering two different sides of potatoes, the hash browns and the breakfast potatoes. Both were good but I will probably stick to the breakfast potatoes next time! I spent about $14 for a short stack with strawberries and two breakfast sides and was not upset about it. Like I said I can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Really good eggs Benedict and Reuben!  The atmosphere is low key and fun.  I would recommend this place for a unique breakfast place."}
{"text":"Small portions.  Disorganized but friendly staff. I want to like you but you need to improve on portion size and organization"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm a sucker for great food.  I came to this place because I have a friend who lives in Vegas and she said it was to die for.  This place is a good 10-15 minute drive away from the strip. We arrived around noon time on a Tuesday but were still in the mood for breakfast since we didn't eat anything beforehand.   The place was filled with people but thank goodness there were still a handful of tables available so we didn't have to wait.

I did decide to yelp the place to check out the popular food items. The same two menu items kept coming up:  RED VELVET PANCAKES and the ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE. So what do we do?  of course we order:

*RED VELEVET PANCAKES 
*ADOBO FRIED RICE

We decided to try both entrees and it was a big hit.  I've was a little apprehensive about ordering the red velvet pancakes because I have ordered them before at other places and they just don't really ever live up to the expectation of my favorite Red Velvet cupcake at Sprinkles but to be honest, it was pretty darn DELICIOUS.I loved how the pancake had a crisp taste on the outside but was also fluffy in the inside.

I only had a few bites of the ADOBO FIRED RICE OMELETTE but from the couple of bites, it tasted YUMMY.

Service  was great too so  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is so delicious!

-Cookie and Cream Pancakes are amazing!  -Also tried the Kalua Pig Benedict and that was very tasty.
-Adobo fried rice was good (per husband)
-Service was mediocre, our server messed up our bill because it was split.
-Didn't bring out the kid's meals first and my youngest got his meal last."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast joint in Las Vegas! The staff is really friendly even though they're always ridiculously busy! There's always a wait period but it's worth it! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"A $10 meal is a fair trade to finally be rid of Babystacks in my restaurant wheelhouse. My family and friends have suckered me into eating here so many times. Simply an epic fail on making over medium or poached medium eggs. Service is always polite and personable even when missing the mark on attention to detail."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped for a quick bite. I settled on the Portuguese sausage and eggs with potatoes and upgraded my stack to the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend got the pig blanket omelette (not sure if name is correct) with hash browns and upgraded his stack to a special stack they called \"orange dream\". Now I'm not a rookie when it comes to Portuguese sausage so I must say that these were pretty good. Juicy, crispy on the edge but not overcooked. The eggs were eggs. Nothing extraordinary but still good. Now the breakfast potatoes, bland with no seasoning not even salt. They did come out hot so I'm sure I could've sprinkled salt on them but I didn't. Ketchup did just fine but I'm pretty sure I'll be getting the hash browns next time around. The red velvet pancakes actually tasted like red velvet and they were good. I remember my first visit when they were called babycakes and their red velvet pancakes were bleh. The kitchen must have finally perfected the recipe because they definitely are worth going back for. Now, as for my boyfriend I can't say that I tried his omelette but I can say he finished it all, so that must be a good sign. His orange dream pancakes...OMG they are to die for. Anyone who reads this, please do yourself a favor and stop by for an orange dream stack."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place after the consistent glowing reviews. I ordered the sweet crepes with bananas, my daughter got chicken fingers. Her food was very hot and mine was cold when it arrived. Waitress never came back to refill drinks until I got up to pay check. I just missed all the craze.... It's like an ihop to me"}
{"text":"The pancakes are inspired by cupcake flavors so why do people complain about it being \"too sweet\"? it's a panCAKE. Do these complainers want it salty or something!? The pancakes are delicious and has just the right amount of sweetness! The servers are friendly and knowledgeable about what they sell. No complaints here! They are \"The Best of Las Vegas\" for a reason and definitely worth the wait! Oh yeah, try the Loco Moco or Adobo Fried Rice if you wanna be in a food coma for the rest of the day :)"}
{"text":"I preface this review by stating that my main complaint, and the reason I shall never return to this business is based on one policy (well and other than the pancakes I find there food to be underwhelming).  Babystacks, at all locations, has a policy that they will not seat any customer until their entire party arrives. Under certain circumstances I could possibly understand this but I was so appalled by my experience this weekend and their response that I just can't go back there. So the first time this happened to me was approximately two years ago at the Rampart location.  I was meeting a friend there for lunch, they were busy, there was just two of us. She was literally about five minutes away. I went up to the counter and they refused to seat me until she arrived I was told \"we don't seat large parties until every one is here\" to which I stated \"two people is a large party?\".  By the time she arrived there was a wait, although there wouldn't have been had they let me be seated. But we waited and ate there.  

Two years pass... till now, I admit I went back once about a year and half ago since then  friends wanted to go there. Last Friday I went there to meet a friend and her daughter who is 18 mo. old. It was about 10:00. There were a couple of people in the restaurant but it was not busy by any means and practically the whole place was empty. When I got there my friend was waiting, with her 18 mo old in hand. She didn't have to say anything to me I knew why they handn't seated her but I inquired of the host nontheless and was told we don't seat parties until everyone has arrived. Bad business policy, no one in the restaurant, you have a mother with a toddler (who anyone with kids nows is hard to do in a restaurant in the first place) and they are not busy by any means. I complained and the host asked if I wanted to talk to the manager, I said yes and this other female walked over. I thought she seemed pretty young to be a manager, maybe around 20 but it could happen so I proceed to tell  her I thought that was poor service. Only to find out (after I finished talking to her for about five minutes) that she wasn't the manager either and the entire time she was smirking without apology which again just made me more livid. By the time I finished talking to her and was told she wasn't the manager I was just too disgusted and tired to discuss this yet a third time with a party. In my opinion they should have a little common sense, if there is no one in the restaurant and it is unlikely there will be a rush of people i.e. it's not a weekend morning then why upset your customers by making them wait. So what if I went in and said it was a party of one - was seated right away and then hey I \"run into\" a friend who wants to sit with me - what then. This won't happen as I am not going back. 

Okay enough of my rant - you get the picture. I will not be returning, nor will my friend who promptly left with me.  As to the food, the pancakes are good, however the rest of the food is just \"meh\" to me. They do have fresh brewed tea. Their potatoes are frozen, I asked and the waiter when I previously dined was refreshingly honest. So it's not like there is going to be a hole in life by not going back there. So from there we went over to Lulu's - which leads me to my next review..."}
{"text":"Good quality food. They don't serve large portion sizes but they are extremely flexible with substitutions. However,  you will leave satisfied.  Great service."}
{"text":"Restaurant looks nice & clean , the hostess & the server was very nice . Food was amazing, great pancake & I love my Crepes"}
{"text":"The food is amazing Banana Foster pancakes are the best ever as well are the skillets. BEST BREAKFAST PLACE IN VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Just went to this place for my first time and the food was great. I had the bacon pancakes with potatoes, egg whites and sausage links. I tried the banana cream pie pancakes that my friend had and those were amazing good and surprisingly not super sweet at all. I recommend this place. It's cheap for the amount you get and it's fresh. Hope my review helps! Note: there are two Baby Stacks Cafe's on Buffalo, so make sure your going to the right one if your meeting someone for breakfast or lunch :-)"}
{"text":"Upon walking in here, they have multiple signs saying they won't split guest checks. So I mentioned to the young woman that I might need a seperate table from my friends if that was the case. She seemed genuinely confused and started looking around for two seperate tables beside each other. The food I got was amazing. lolo Ricks adobo and the Nutella and banana crepes. I had to ask twice for two seperate to go boxes. Food was great but the service definitely left a slight bit to be desired. They were nice....just not super on top of things. I will definitely be back to try some of their other tasty looking menu items."}
{"text":"I have been looking on yelp for new places to go and eat, being that we are fairly new to the area. I seen the pictures of all the different pancakes and had to come and try for myself! AMAZING! I had steak and eggs and banana cream pie shirt stack Great food friendly staff and decent prices ! We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Overpriced for low quality food.  Went there for buttermilk pancakes and got flour, water and sugar. The kahula pig was bland with no flavor. Coffee was watered out. If they were once four stars the management has cut corners to drop them down to one.  Felt ripped off and hungry when I left. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"I had to update my previous review! Although my star rating hasn't changed (still 5/5) I wanted to change my comment of referring to the wait staff as mediocre. My boyfriend and I have been regulars here almost every weekend (it's THAT good) for the past 10 months and the service has been excellent. I love this place. It's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Probably the most real food I've had in Vegas.  Generous portions, hearty food, great price.  There's always a line, though, so be ready for a wait.  (It's worth it!)
Oh, and get the house's special garlic rice, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"We heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it. The menu looked amazing and we came hungry. I ordered kalua pig Benedict and my husband ordered adobo fried rice with Mac salad. Both were not good at all! The kalua pig Benedict was kalua pig and CABBAGE Benedict...totally gross no taste from the kalua pig and the English muffin on the bottom was soggy from water...if it was soggy from like a tasty liquid that would've been different but it wasn't. The adobo fried rice was junk. If you are from Hawaii and know good adobo fried this was not even close. We thought aloha kitchen AFR was junk this was worse. The Mac salad was DISGUSTING to say the very least. It had no taste and the macaroni tasted old. It was like soaked (not boiled) macaroni in a watery white substance. I gave this one star because we also ordered the red velvet pancakes and although it was a little dry it did taste good. We also got a side of zippy's chili which was about an ounce for $2.75 that tasted good (like zippys chili) so our bill came out to $47 and some cents and we were Very Very disappointed to have to pay that much for such a crappy meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot, red velvet pancakes are amazing. All the food is good, pancakes are great, havent tried the crepes yet. The one downside was the gravy for the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy are just, eh. Its not horrible but I've had better.
All in all, I like it for breakfast, and them red velvet pancakes, makes me want to be a fat kid."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I got corn beef and hashand it was like eating cat food. My friends toast came out burnt and 20 minutes after we ordered. The butter on the toast was just a squeeze butter. The chicken fried steak was absolutely horrible. It was just bread. Then to top it off as we were checking out the hostess didn't understand the fact that I wanted to do half cash half card. She just charged it's all on to my card. Every one was VERY disorganized.  I've heard some great things about this place. But my experience was very shitty. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a guilty pleasure.  Went for breakfast with the family and we ended up passing food around the table the whole time.  All that could be heard from our table was \"You have got to taste this!\"  The red velvet pancakes made me feel like I was eating dessert for breakfast and so did the carrot cake pankcakes.

Prices were excellent and I will defintely go back.  Our plan next time is to order different pancakes and just pass a cake around to everyone at the table.  Kinda pancake buffet style."}
{"text":"This was my first time there ever.  It really bothered me that they won't seat you unless your entire party is there.  It was so empty inside.  It was an okay breakfast place.  It's pretty normal.  They had pancakes, and omelettes and other normal breakfast item.  I ordered the eggs and sausage that came with pancakes and seasoned potatoes or other items.  I paid $1.50 upcharge for the specialty pancakes.  What's the point of going to Babystacks to get regular pancakes.  I ordered the s'mores which were really good.  They have white chocolate chips, marshmallows and little bits of graham cracker shavings.  I usually like to have toast with my eggs because I like to dip my bread in the yolk.  

All in all, it was normal for breakfast."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this little cafe strictly based on the Yelp reviews. We are so happy we did. Although the wait was a bit long, we are used to waits from other happening spots like The Bagel Cafe, Hash House-a-Go-Go and The Omelet House. So, 20 minutes wasn't too bad, if I was starving, yes, it would not have been good. 

The cafe is little, and there were a couple large parties that definitely slowed things down a bit. I'm not sure if there is a best time to come but it was worth the wait.

We had the red velvet pancakes (to die for), the honey french toast (deliciously large and savory) and the s'mores pancakes (divine!) 

We also shared an omelet with cheese, bacon and sausage and potates. 

The former Becker restaurant is closed - maybe they can take that place over so there's more seats and less of a wait - just a thought :) 

Overall, we were very happy and full! We would definitely come back again. The cafe is quaint and you feel like you are at a local's spot, which is always very nice. This is definitely a once a month treat because I can only imagine how many calories are associated with food that tastes so heavenly! 

Yay Babycakes!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast with the best service. The place is small and fills up fast but the wait is never long as service is prompt and tables are quickly cleaned.  everything on the menu is good, wether you want healthy or comfort food this is the place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Babystacks for a couple years now and I finally made it down here. It definitely lived up to my expectations! I got two half stacks of pancakes because I couldn't decide on one flavor: the carrot cakes and the caramel apple pancakes. They were both amazing! The pancakes were fluffy and perfectly cooked. The rest of the family loved their food too. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Prior to opening this location, we had experienced Babystacks only once before at the location on the other side of town.  That experience had been pretty damn amazing, so we couldn't wait for this location to open up.  And now that it is open?  It's hard to convince my wife that we don't have to eat here every single weekend.

The best selling point of this place are the various pancakes they have, almost all available in half-stacks or full-stacks.  These range from Orange Dreamsicle pancakes to Banana Cream pancakes and everything in between.  The absolute best that they have are the Cookies and Cream pancakes, which are to die for.  I'm not sure why they are on the special board and not on the permanent menu yet, but do not miss out on them.  

Everything we've ever tried here has been great.  We've built our own skillets before, we've tried the Kalua pork sandwich - it's all turned out well.  The service is typically good and the wait times aren't too long, though it can get fairly busy on weekend mornings.

Seriously though.  Get yourself some cookies and cream pancakes.  You know you deserve it."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, waited almost an hour, they were calling names of people that came in after us. Pretty bad that we got better customer service at McDonald's than there."}
{"text":"Wonderful! I'd been hearing good things and decided to try it for myself and was not disappointed. The red velvet pancakes, chicken fried steak and even the hash browns were better than any I've ever tasted. Fresh ingredients with the right amount of seasonings paired with great service made it a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Get the red velvet pancakes and Mexican omelet. Trust me on this one! Best I've ever had and I'm a foodie."}
{"text":"Oh this place seriously has the BEST pancakes EVER! My favorites are the red velvet, banana fosters and carrot cake. It's one of the best places in Vegas for breakfast, it's always busy so be prepared to wait but it's usually not too long. The breakfast burrito is a must, I usually modify it a bit, but it always comes out delicious! The staff is friendly and always on top of things."}
{"text":"We love the food here :) yum yum yum :) Can't wait to go back. The only bad thing is the place is so small..wish it was bigger so the wait wouldn't be as long. Hopefully with their success will come a larger restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is worth their long wait. It's a small place and the food is great so what do you expect? Everything I've ever had here tasted great and the servers are always sweet as pie :)"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes and the Rick's Adobo fried rice omelette are amazing! This place can be extremely busy on Sundays."}
{"text":"The best pancakes! Love it all! Can't go wrong with anything really, your choice of topping on the pancakes or their delicious omelettes!"}
{"text":"Excellent family cafe. Pancakes & omelets are delicious. Lots of pancake varieties to choose from. Excellent & friendly service."}
{"text":"We were rolling out of Vegas headed back to Phoenix and my wife heard about their Red Velvet Pancakes and had to have some so we stopped in. The place was packed on a Sat. morning but tables were turned quickly so it wasn't that bad of a wait time. I had a chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and smores pancakes-YUM! The wife loves her Red Velvet Pancakes as well. Great food, great service, good prices!"}
{"text":"Its really sad that i have to give this place 2 stars. But after coming here a few times and not being satisfied with their serving portions on the pricier meals i have to rate it mainly on that. If im going to pay $12 for a meal then a $1 upgrade garlic fee then i expect to get a little more than a half cup of rice with my meal. Its seriously like 4 bites and my rice is gone. But i guess i can pay another $3 for another 4 bites of rice...? 
The flavors are amazing. I have had the corned beef hash, the country fried steak, the Adobo fried rice and an omelette. All very tasty. The pancakes are ok. They are not light and fluffy as i would like them but if u pile a bunch of their toppings on them theyre not that bad. The cashier was rude and server was nice. I dont know if i will return again...maybeeeee one last try...."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and quick. Restaurant was clean and had a nice atmosphere. Enjoyed the red velvet pancakes. With the whipped cream and cream cheese syrup? with every bite it was delicious. Crunchy bacon and decent loco moco as well. Can be a wait to eat sometimes but I consider that a good sign of a great place!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from the strip to eat here twice while we were in Vegas. The Banana Foster pancakes were incredible. And if you've never had Portuguese sausage you have to try it. My husband is Brazilian and this is just as good as the sausage we have in Brazil. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome stacks!!!

there was a waiting list but we were sited in no time at all..

service was great..   food was delicious,,  

the skin on the stacks were amazingly crispy - nothing like I had eaten before.


This is definitely on my \"TO GO\" list when I head back to Viva Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Very decadent place. My fav is the Rick adobo fried rice omelette, so delicious. Tasty with a perfectly cooked egg. I was also being a little piggy and had to try their crepe which I'm big fan of crepes and was not disappointed. I will need to visit again!"}
{"text":"This is a must for my bf and me every time we head to Vegas.  As soon as we grabbed our rent a car this past weekend, we came here.  It was around 10am and the wait was about 15 min.  But hey, it was a Sunday and anywhere breakfast spot it going to be busy.  

I ordered the macadamia nut white chocolate pancakes and a side of bacon.  The pancakes come in a reg stack which is 6 or a short stack which is 3.  The three is plenty for me and I usually can only eat two. The pancakes are full of macadamia nuts and sprinkled with mini white choco chips.The side of bacon is three nice, crispy, thick pieces that aren't greasy.  Just thinking about this is making for hungry.

My bf ordered the red Velvet pancakes the first time we went and they were pretty good.  He loved them, but I'm not the biggest fan of red velvet.  This time around he ordered the corn beef hash, which hash browns, and he upgraded his pancakes to the Almond Joy ones.  Man those pancakes were so yummy.  Chocolate pancakes with a ton of coconut in them.  Who wouldn't love those?

The service is always friendly, the food comes out pretty quick despite them being always busy, and I can't wait till our next trip to Vegas so I can eat some yummy pancakes."}
{"text":"Always a long line... so be prepared bit it's worth it in my opinion. I love all the different kinds of breakfasts they offer. Hawaiian, american and filipino.  The red velvet pancakes are amazing, spam, eggs and rice is a winner... haven't had anything bad except a couple times my pancakes were a little tough and over cooked"}
{"text":"I came here once on a weekday and wasn't expecting it to be packed. Had to wait 20 - 30 minutes to be seated. Not that bad. It was busy so I understand. Customer service was very good! Our server was kind and checked in on us every once in awhile to see if everything was okay. It didn't take too long for the food to come out either for a place that was busy. Sadly I was on a budget that day so all I got were nutella crepes. Since it was my first time trying crepes I wasn't sure if there suppose to be cold? I still want to come back and try the other foods on the menu. One day I will!  Food can be pricey but that's basically like any other restaurant/cafe out there. If you love a sweet breakfast, this place has a lot of options for you! The staff is friendly as well so that's a bonus!

Only negative things I have to say about this place is that the tables are very close to one another. Almost as if I was eating with the family next to me haha. And the tables were too small. If there was more room/space in general, that would be great."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, and the service is stellar, what else do you need to say. This is my new regular breakfast place to eat and bring friends and family."}
{"text":"The food was great! The smores pancakes are to die for :) The only negative thing I have to say is the wifi was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Great place. Small and cozy. Worth the wait in line. Much better than IHOP. My husband intrtoduce me to this place recently. Great place but I wish they didn't put this annoying loud mouth girl sitting near us. Why do people think that others want to hear their conversation.? And then she had an annoying laugh"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We entered and waited for over 10 minutes to be seated and not one employee said hello or welcome. They had 1 waitress and 1 cashier. We ended up leaving since no one was being seated although several tables were available"}
{"text":"I got my order to go today boy were they super friendly and fast yum yum. Everyone seems to work together so well it's great to see a business that's run like a family instead of a big corporate dragon. I'm so glad to see a place where customer service is important again"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is great. All around my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. Must try the red velvet pancakes!!!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line first: good breakfast at a good price.

Not a fan of the way the restaurant is set up, making it very crowded. This is the second location, and they opened it because the line was always out the door at the tiny first location, but I'm not sure it alleviated anything. They now have two tiny locations with long waits. Note: a tiny cup of syrup is all you get for your pancakes.. if you want more it is 75 cents per cup! Service is iffy but great food keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"This place has yet to disappoint. Service is great, food comes out hot and fast. Love love the Red Velvet pancakes!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes! Makes me want to drive to vegas just to have Babycakes' Red Velvet Pancakes. Also, the adobo omelet is very good (I think its called Rick's Adobo fried rice) 

Place is pretty small although our party had 11 people they accommodated us.

So when you are in Las Vegas drop by this place for breakfast. It's yummmmyyy!"}
{"text":"Okay. I got here at 12:30pm. Ordered the adobo fried rice which was freakin fantastic. My cup of coffee was never less than half full. It's 12:54pm and I've been finished for about 5min. About to go pay my bill which is another fantastic thing about this place being that it has such low prices with expensive tasting food.  

GO...."}
{"text":"For vacations, I love to browse yelp to look fro great places to eat in the city I visit.  So, for this past winter break I went to Vegas with friends and family.  Before we left Las Vegas, I wanted to try out Babycakes since it seemed pretty popular on yelp and one of their specialties was red velvet pancakes.  Mind you I LOVE red velvet cake/cupcakes/yogurt, so this was a must try.  

My friends and I came at the right time and we didn't have to wait long.  This was probably around 8:45 Friday morning New Year's Eve.  The server was wonderful and friendly.  I of course ordered red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup and a cup of coffee.  It was soft and fluffy like a flattened red velvet cake.  I truly enjoyed the pancakes, and so did my boyfriend (we shared a full stack).  I would definitely have to stop by here again whenever I come back to Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast with my dad. This place is busy but definitely reason to be busy since they have good food and a good vibe. Locals come here for an affordable breakfast that caters to their customers. So many options of food. You will enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"I ate here late one weekday morning after picking up a friend from the airport, so it wasn't exactly primetime for them, but they still had a good bit of business coming and going while we were there. They seemed well staffed for it, although it did take our food a long time to come considering we had a couple eggs a piece, bacon, and pancakes (no steaks, omelettes, or anything too taxing).

Everything was very decent: not amazing, but certainly not terrible. It was plenty good enough, although maybe not up to the rave reviews I'd heard from other friends about the place. My hash browns though; those were awful. I specifically ordered them burnt. Not crispy - burnt. I do that everywhere I go in the hopes of actually getting crispy hash browns. The ones I got were soggy, limp, way too thick, and a bit sickly looking. I would have sent them back if we hadn't already waited so long for our food that we were ready to eat and get on with our day. 

Overall, the food and the service was decent. I would go back with no hesitation if someone I was with wanted to, but it probably won't be my recommendation for breakfast anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! Food is cheap to moderately priced. The restaurant has four locations in the Vegas valley, and they all have the same theme--Hawaiian fusion, with a variety of other foods. A great place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I just finished my food. Great food. Our server Jacob was outstanding! True aloha coming out of this little cafe! Must try! 5 stars for babystacks!"}
{"text":"No real maple syrup, and all the choices they had were overly sweetened and kinda disgusting. So I didn't eat the pancakes. Eggs were undercooked (I ordered over medium and they were still runny). Service was slow - one server for a full restaurant. And everything was cold when it arrived. Hash browns were okay. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and have not been disappointed yet.  The food is great and definitely enough to fill you up.  The service as well is good in the place I would have to say the only downer is that sometimes there is a bit of a wait...But other than that its a great place to go to for breakfast (only times I've gone is for breakfast).  The pancakes they have are very flavorful as well as their skillets.  These are the only things I've ordered so far because there's so much variety just within those 2 things.  This place is a must go to."}
{"text":"White chocolate macadamia nut pancakes, adobo rice omelette...they got some good stuff here. =)"}
{"text":"Good food with prices. Lots of variety. 

If you like huevos rancheros you will like the ones they serve here. I asked for an extra egg rather than the chicken and fruit opposed to potatoes. YUM."}
{"text":"Shortly after my last review a manager contacted me and asked for me to come back and give them another try.  After awhile I finally did and am happy to say the service was much better and the food was super yummy.  We have been back a few times and I always get their egg breakfast and upgrade to whatever pancakes are on special.  I've really enjoyed the bananas foster and appreciate their serving sizes.  Great for sharing with a toddler who doesn't eat that much.  I can tell this is a businesses that really does care about their customers.  To bad they were not in a bigger location as the wait times can be bad especially when you have kids in tow. Which is always for my family."}
{"text":"The food takes foooooooooorever to get to you. The service is pretty crap too. We waited 20 min just to get water and then had to flag down a server to just order food. Then we waited 30 more minutes for the food....
The food is not worth the frustration!!!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in town!! So glad I found this place. The skillets are so delicious, I have such a hard time deciding which one to get everytime I come here. And the service has always been great."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here on several occasions, the LocoMoco is the best I've had on the mainland.  I normally have this when I am in Hawaii.  Go early because this place is popular and gets crowded quickly."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! Caution on the weekends as the wait can be 45 minutes minimum but it is worth it. Food comes out fast and is always delicious!!! Definitely worth a try if nothing else."}
{"text":"Just went back to our favorite breakfast place today, never disappointed. Our server Carlos was very friendly and was on top of everything, didn't have to ask for a thing. Had the country-fried steak, always a winner. My daughter had the mushroom burger  Hot N Juicy. If you go for the first time you have to try the specialty pancakes"}
{"text":"Best place in town for breakfast or lunch, the menu was very eclectic, my daughter had the Banana Foster pancakes, but I had the chicken fried steak, country gravy was perfect and so was the potatoes. The cherry on the sundae was our server Carlos, very friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"We were here in 2014 and it was bad then, thought we would try it again and it has not changed.   The staff is rude, and very slow.  We waited for at least a half hour and when we were finally seated, it was at a table that had been empty for at least 15 minutes prior to us being seated.  In fact there were several empty tables and many people waiting to be seated.  The cashier was very rude and the entire staff just seems to not care if you are a happy customer or not. Food is fine, but just ok."}
{"text":"Love this place.  This has become our go to for a weekend breakfast.

Yes, the wait can be long, but either come early (before 10:00) or have some patience. 

The Rick's Adobo Fried Rice is to die for.  Can't go wrong with the specialty pancakes.  The red velvet or strawberry are perfect with the adobo for that salty/sweet satisfying combo.

The build your own skillets are amazing as well.  Just the right amount of food to make you feel comfortably full.

No complaints with the service, they've always been gracious and accommodating when we've been there."}
{"text":"Food here was ok. Place was really small, loud and the wait long.  I had the Nutella crepes which where huge but just ok. I swear they used 1/2 jar of Nutella in them. Made them sticky sweet. Other pancakes were not really anything special. The service was really good but I'm not likely to be back since I can get the same from IHOP or original pancake and not have to wait forever for a table."}
{"text":"The food is delicious (red velvet pancakes and banana cream pancakes) but while the service was friendly, they were not attentive."}
{"text":"Very great service and a great place to hang out with family! Food is awesome. Gets pretty busy on Sundays around 10am."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Wide variety of pancakes, and I always think it's a bonus when you can order Portuguese sausage with rice for your morning. Chili loco moco has chili like Zippy's, for you Hawaii folks out there. Will def need to try that when I go back. Red velvet pancakes are a fan favorite for a reason."}
{"text":"Will go back again. What a wonderful find thanks to Amazon Local.  Lemon ricotta pancakes were mire than delicious.  Love the menu, food, decor and the staff were great."}
{"text":"You have to the get red velvet pancakes!!! Its worth the wait. I could eat it everyday its just that good."}
{"text":"The Red Velvet Pancakse are more like a dessert than a breakfast item. When judged as a dessert, they're not that amazing. I think people are getting excited over the fact that they can eat breakfast and have it taste like dessert here! haha.  I did love the whole wheat French Toast though. The Kailua Pigg Egg thingy got a lot of positive reviews so I gave it a whirl, not to my liking but probably enjoyable to most. There's a lot of talk about the wait here. I went at 11:00 on a Wednesday expecting it to not be busy because it's a breakfast place. WRONG! We had to wait like everyone else, and yes, even though there seemed to be tables around. Waitress was really good!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet pancakes. The cream cheese frosting/syrup is insanely good. We'll definitely be back very soon.

Oh yea we also had some breakfast foods to go with the pancakes. Good but not as good as the red velvet."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, service was fast, and friendly.

I do not eat panckaes eggs, and haven't for YEARS, not only my did I eat them but I loved them! I had the chicken omlet, and the Lemon Ricotta pancakes. The fresh lemon and cream cheese icing made it! I told my husband, we will be back because there are a few more pankcakes i want to try. He was happy with his plate too, the Loco Moco.
 You may have made me a pancake eater! Way to go."}
{"text":"This place was so bad, from the time we walked in, threw our breakfast, till the time we left.

We walked in, busy and I expected that, didn't take our name down or how many in our party, forgot who was first and going where....it was so freakin hot.

Waiter came over, he was really sweet and funny, but our food came out and it was a train wreck! My friend ordered crispy bacon and it came out soggy, my husbands egg Benedict came out and the biscuits were soggy so we asked for new ones and those were soggy too, his breakfast was so bad he didn't even want to finish it. I got the country fried steak breakfast and I enjoyed it up until my husband decided he wanted to eat the eggs, I don't like eggs, he was so excited and hungry to eat them, he got them all dressed up and ready to eat and then when he went to go take a bite there is a whole corner of a plastic cut off in the eggs.

We ask for a manager and they came over and said that they had no idea where the plastic came from because all their stuff is organic and not packaged, which is bull crap, because when I walked in I could see the shelves with the cans in the back in the kitchen. And I find it disturbing that a manager would say that they have no idea where it came from instead of making us as guests feel comfortable.

It was a bad experience, it was disgusting, we will never go back there."}
{"text":"Maybe I had a bad experiance here... But everything I had was below average (omelete and regular pancakes). I much prefer the cracked egg just down the road."}
{"text":"Food is good, wait time is long due to small dinning room. Only issue I had was two ladies plucking there eye brows in the waiting area, the manger should have acknowledge, made me want to leave before trying out the food..."}
{"text":"The Red Velvet Pancakes and the Cookie Butter French Toast are amazing!!!  Great food and great service!!!"}
{"text":"Don't come to this one.  Go to buffalo.  Managers still need to train their haole front desk."}
{"text":"We walked in this morning, placed our names on the waitlist, and sat in the waiting area.  My partner noticed a squashed roach on the floor. I'm a big Dirty Dining follower, so I tried my very best to pretend I didn't see that  poor unfortunate creature. Then seconds later, another huge roach was crawling leisurely like he owns this place to his dead friend.  We walked right out in disgust. I really liked this place too."}
{"text":"Man babystacks Is just amazing !!!!! :) that guy chris with the glasses and the amazing smile was leaning tables like crazy today I dined in and had a cookie butter French toast and the service was great my coffee was always full Vincent was so nice to us 

I also came backed placed a to go order and that young man with the nice hair is always on the rush and gives everybody a nice smile and attitude 

The place is organized and way bigger than the other locations I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place for breakfast and came across this place. Definitely not disappointed. I got the baby chick skillet with my eggs over easy and I upgraded my pancakes to the lemon ricotta. Deeeelicious. Coffee is also really good. Now we have another place to add for weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"OMG. MY FAVORITE PLACE EVER. Hands down. Favorite resturant in all of Las Vegas. Seriously amazing!!!! I get the piglet skillet & either Red Velvet Pancakes or the Orange Dreamcicle pancakes. Seriously you have to try the Orange Dreamcicle ones.. Seriously the best thing ever. You will NOT regret it!!! Sometimes there is quite a long wait but the food is so worth it..."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The breakfast choices are superior with an addition of rice and some neat choices you usually don't see! The BEST though is the pancake choices! Red Velvet, s'mores, banana fosters yummy, just to name a few! If you haven't tried this place yet - your missing a piece of happiness!!"}
{"text":"Best Pancakes ever!  I've never tried buttermilk pancakes that were this fluffy...  That's why we had to come here again!

And in the meanwhile, we tried most of their breakfast items:

Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly each time (3 orders total).  I prefer the ones with spinach.
Red Velvet pancakes were delicious!  Never tried them before, but now I know how fluffy they are supposed to be.
The omelette was also delicious.
Although my wife didn't enjoy the crepe, I did; and we both agree that the sweet cream inside was outstanding.

Despite going on a weekday both times, we had to wait for approximately 15 minutes.  I can imagine how long the weekend lines must get...  But so worth it!"}
{"text":"I so love breakfast, and their breakfast is always so hot and great...!!! I freaking love love the lemon riattco pancakes and the piglet!!! Severs are always friendly fast and great!!"}
{"text":"I just got home from having brunch here.  My first time.  It was delicious.  I had their French toast with some kind of middle spread.
Since I started my review, I've returned there one more time.
My granddaughter had the strawberry pancakes and she loved it.  I had the same French toast dish that I had last time.  (I'm a creature of habit.)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Something on the menu for everyone. Less then $10 a person. Very laidback. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like to take my grandparents here as there is something for everyone. It's strip mall location suits the fantastic Filipino and Hawaiian-inspired dishes offered alongside creative takes on pancakery. It's just laid back island style made it the best."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place for pancakes. Seriously. There's usually a bit of a wait on weekends, but it's worth it. If you want excellent pancakes, Babystacks is the place to be. I've been here 3-4 times already and I love it. Their portions are pretty big, so if you're not a heavy eater, SPLIT it! Also a tad bit too sweet IMO, but still excellent."}
{"text":"This is the place I go to when I'm not looking for half price breakfast at Sierra Gold or willing to drive down to Hash House A Go Go. Everything I've had here so far is excellent. I would say that they are better at a quick waffle or pancake plate as well as a fast egg plate than HHAGG. The presentation is great as long you don't need fireworks and fanfare to set the tone of your breakfast. If you want rapid service, fresh, hot coffee, and fresh food, then this is the place. While not nearly as expensive as HHAGG, the quality and size of portions are not as great, either. This is a perfect place to meet up for a quick and quality breakfast, with several locations in the LV area, although I can only vouch for the one at Smoke Ranch and Buffalo. If I can't get to, or am not willing to spend the money required to eat at HHAGG, then this is my guaranteed second place to go eat breakfast. It's an easy recommendation for any casual breakfast eaters."}
{"text":"So worth the long wait!!  I was a little nervous that the red velvet pancake was going to be too sweet, but I'm so glad I heeded Yelpers' advice and went for it.  Really moist and delicious, and so unique.  Boyfriend had the white chocolate macadamia pancake, which neither of us was crazy about -- a little on the dry and sweet side.  Also had a skillet, which was very good as well (although it could use a little less salt).  And just as important, the coffee is nice and strong.  A good reason to go back to Las Vegas.  Please open a store in Dublin, CA (we sure could use a good breakfast joint here)!"}
{"text":"The food is so good here that I get babystacks every time I go to Las Vegas. I got the turkey avocado sandwich (sorry if I didn't say the exact name of the sandwich) and it never disappoints. My usual go to is the carrot cake pancakes but I decided to change it up. The fries don't come with that much seasoning so if you like the flavor you should ask for some extra. The sandwich is fresh and especially good on sourdough toast. The meal comes with a pickle so if that isn't your thing then I suggest you ask them to not include it on your plate. Waiting time to get seated is a little much sometimes usually around 30 minutes but can go over very quickly. Food is served around 15-20 minutes. Worth it though!!"}
{"text":"The other Baby Stacks locations are way better than this one! Came in on a Monday morning, so not too crazy busy. The service was mediocre and so was the food. I ordered the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs with Red Velvet pancakes and the sausage was not seasoned or cooked very well. I could literally taste the salt in my pancakes and I even had to get up and grab my own utensils and ketchup. They don't do justice for the other Baby Stacks locations."}
{"text":"Love this place! My breakfast was delicious once again :-) I had the chicken fried steak which is never a disappointment! Fast service and great staff! Plus, the blueberry pancakes were a total bonus too ;-)"}
{"text":"The wait for this place is always ridiculous, they should consider expanding perhaps. The food is good but its not the best in town. Ive had a few of the pancakes and the omelette with basically everything. Good portions and about the same price as any other breakfast spot is."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Waitress with a fantastic sense of humor.  We ate here several times during a week of vacation. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"The food was good; the service and policy leave a lot to be desired. Mind-numbingly stupid staff.

I asked for milk for our coffee and was charged $2.25 for it; that's definitely a first. I asked the cashier if the policy was to charge for milk for coffee. I was told no, the server must not have understood; she continued to charge me instead of correcting it or asking a manager for assistance.

We also asked if a short stack of pancakes could be made into silver dollar sized (kid sized) pancakes. Not for extra pancakes, syrup, etc. Sure, but it's $2 extra. For the exact same amount of batter on the same exact plate. WTF?

Check your bill carefully."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. We ordered the adobo fried office omelet and the red velvet pancakes that a lot of people rave about. The adobo fried rice was just ok. In my opinion, it was a bit dry for my taste. As for the red velvet pancakes, it tasted more like you are just eating cake with cream cheese frosting. It was way took thick and heavy. I like my pancakes to be fluffy and the red velvet definitely does not meet this criteria. I live in the Henderson side, so I won't waste my time driving to Buffalo road just for so-so food."}
{"text":"This place always takes so long to seat you, the service is never on point. If you go, make sure you have a ton of time to wait. On the up side, that food is actually pretty good, if you have all afternoon to wait for it that is..."}
{"text":"A friend and I saw the reviews and thought this was a winner. We both ordered the veggie omelet, pancakes and hash browns. Neither of us use maple syrup, so we both asked for extra butter. It took so long I got up to remind and walked towards our waitress to remind her. The hash browns were cold and so were the pancakes. Our waitress offered to re-do the order. This time the hash browns came before the pancakes,  and were still cold. The omelet itself was good, but nothing special. The pancakes were not light and fluffy. Our waitress gave a \"military discount\" of 10% apologizing that she wasn't allowed to give more. The cashier asked how the meal was and when I told him he too was sorry. So was I - we will never go back"}
{"text":"Okay, right off the bat I need to state that I am a Goin-Out-TO-Breakfast fiend. It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.

I learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.

Their hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.

And that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?). 

So I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, \"Really?\"?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning \"Really?\" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an \"epic fail\". 

I'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.

BS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends, \"Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns.\"

Long after the trendy red velvet thing has passed, people will still love going out to breakfast."}
{"text":"We read all the reviews on the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice omelet and had to try this place out.  I am so glad we did.  I think I experienced a tiny bit of heaven when I took my first bite of the fluffy pancakes.  Definitely a great place for a mix of local flavors, reminiscent of Hawaii.  The staff is also awesome - the aloha spirit lives on the mainland here!  :)"}
{"text":"Best bananas foster pancakes! Friendly service and great food! Carrot cake pancakes and the red velvet are also awesome! Very accommodating if you'd like changes or substitutes. 
I've been there twice so far and received excellent service each time :) the food comes out fast !"}
{"text":"Saturday morning breakfast Decadence!  I'm usually a pretty healthy eater, but when it's time for a treat this place is fantastic!  It was Saturday morning and we were prepared for a wait, but the weather was nice and it was worth it.  The service is great.  Friendly knowledgable staff who make you feel at home.  The red velvet pancakes are wonderful!  Not too sweet.  I had the garlic rice and eggs and it was savory and perfect.  My husband indulged in a Full Stack of the Rocky Road pancakes.  Really good, but rich and he took half home.  A short stack is plenty.  This place is close for us and I look forward to going back and trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Found this place with my wife about 5 months ago...we now go every weekend!! The service here is excellent! Yes there is often a wait but the reason for the wait only confirms my 5 star rating! The food is fantastic and very consistent. My wife enjoys the rocky road pancakes, while I always get the red velvet!!! Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Great food! Staff is extremely nice ! I love the atmosphere and the variety of pancakes that they have on the menu"}
{"text":"This is a Sunday regular for us. The food is absolutely delicious. And the service is nice. It's a bit crowded because they are so popular, but that doesn't bother us any.
Tip: They are very busy Sunday mornings so expect a wait, and they won't seat you until all the members of your pay are present."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything!!!  

The host (a younger male) doesn't smile, doesn't greet you, doesn't thank you, and makes you wait to be helped while he hangs out in the back.. The servers are great, but the host needs training, and manners!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles, I wanted to try some restaurants off the Las Vegas strip that were more reasonably priced, but still delicious. Enter BabyStacks.  Man oh man, do they have the best Bananas Foster pancakes!  Soooo good!  Perfect texture and sweetness.  Service was friendly and pleasant.  I'll definitely make a point to visit BabyStacks the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This eatery has fair prices and good food. That said, I feel that
by comparing this eatery to others in its category (breakfast and
lunch...omelets and pancakes its main orientation) it falls short
of AT LEAST the breakfast and lunch buffets at Gold Coast,
Sun Coast, and Palace Station...as well as direct competitors
Norm's Eggs Café and Mr. Mamas. It is for those reasons
that I rate it 3 Stars, the midpoint between lousy & great."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience, I mean breakfast is always the same almost everywhere you go, but the customer service and their specialties... Right at your service, definitely worth it, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love all the different variety of pancake flavored and the Adobo omelette! Check This place out for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"loved it. The food was delicious, service was phenomenal and the portions were perfect."}
{"text":"First visit today. Service was great - food was fast, hot and tasty despite being very busy. Big breakfast menu and more limited lunch menu. Bananas Foster pancakes were a sweet treat. Hawaiian influenced items like Loco Moco and Kalua pork. Very nice staff. Good coffee! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Holy Wow this place is bomb!!
Make sure you try the Red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup.
Amazing Pancakes. The Ranchero Skillet is great but small portion.
Kalua pork Eggs Benedict made me warm & fuzzy inside. I wanted to go back to bed after this great breakfast."}
{"text":"I come here a lot and this time I was a little bit upset at the kitchen more then waitstaff. The cashier and our server was super friendly and the cashier joked with us. But I ordered an extra side of crispy potatoes and the came out not only soggy but cold, like they were old potatoes. When i asked for them to be made crispier the next ones she brought out tasted like they just refried the other ones. This place used to be one of my favorites and now it's slowly becoming more mediocre."}
{"text":"Yes it's small and the wait can be long, but came here with my family on 7/6/2011 and was not disappointed. The red velvet pancakes were fantastic. Also ordered the Adobo fried rice, which I wouldn't again. But the pancakes would bring me back, and soon. Compared to the awful experience I had the following day at Egg Works on Flamingo, the service here is phenomenal. Definitely worth the drive from West Summerlin."}
{"text":"Babystacks is where its at and is by far the best place for breakfast on a sunday. The worst part is everyone knows it and its long waits to get food
But the wait is well worth it because the food is awesome"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Am not just following the bandwagon, but their food is amazing. My sister who is an extremely picky eater even loved it. I believe I got their eggs and ham, yummy. 
And let's not forget about their pancakes, delicious. 

The only downfall would be the waiting time. I mean if you go right when they open you're good. But if you go a little past their opening time. Chances are you will probably have to wait. But I honestly think it's worth the wait. 

P.S the one of Diamond wasn't as packed and we didn't have to wait at all. 

Please extend your locations to California. Maybe LA?:)"}
{"text":"Got the Kalua pig eggs benedict. It was very good! Wife got the adobo fried rice omelette that was good too. We are definitely going back again to try other items on the menu. We're gonna bring the kids next time.

Finally a good islander spot to eat. They even play island reggae music too!"}
{"text":"I got the banana Foster pancakes and my wife got the loco moco. One of the best breakfasts we've had in a long time. The vibe is super cool, the staff is really nice (our server Jessica), and we both got full for less than 10 bucks. This is my new favorite breakfast spot in town!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a decent weekend breakfast standby when on a pinch, or craving cheap & dirty eats....by \"dirty\" I mean the aftermath of consuming highly processed food. For those who aren't health conscious, there's a line out the door."}
{"text":"Simply a delicious breakfast place. Friendly and attentive staff! Must try the red velvet pancakes! Yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch place!  The Ranchero Skillet is my favorite!  They make their green sauce there and it's amazing!!  Pancakes are really good too. The wooden benches are cute, but definitely not the most comfortable after a while. Try to get there early for breakfast, unless you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"It's okay I come here because the red velvet pancakes. All other pancakes taste like I'm eating baking powder. This location was the first opened so it's pretty small and you will always be waiting. The location in centennial has zero waits. So if you don't mind the drive I suggest that one.  They do have great corn beef hash because there is always way more meat than potatoes. And they cut he potatoes pretty small also try out the adobo fried rice wrapped in scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Been to all 3 places multiple times. Rice always mushy. Mac salad no taste. Pancakes awesome!"}
{"text":"There was really nothing I didn't like about this cafe :) I am very very picky and went over the dining experience in my head afterwards; It was nearly perfect :D We got seated right away, and while it was packed elbow to elbow in there, :) we placed our order as fast as we could figure out what we wanted. The wait was not long enough :P as we didn't even get to finish our argument about what science experiments I could keep in the house :) and the food was delicious and abundant. I had the 2 egg plate (scrambled with just egg whites), hash-browns and a short stack of Carrot (pan)Cakes. They were flipping fantastic, especially with some hot sauce (which they brought without me asking, before my meal arrived). My guest ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which only come in one size (fits all) and I tried some of it and we both agreed they were a triumph of breakfast food. The service was attentive and positive the whole time; except that they didn't bring us our check once it was obvious that we had finished our meals, which I've heard is polite but I prefer efficiency in my dining experience :P"}
{"text":"OMG this place was fantastic!   Well worth the 45 minute wait (we waited next door at the Sierra Gold cassino).   Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict was so unbelievably amazing!   Fresh Holindase sauce.  We tried the Red Velvet pancakes and they were like nothing I've ever had before. So delicious! We will definitely come back before we head home to try more of the pancakes.  This place does NOT disappoint!"}
{"text":"We wanted to eat where the locals eat and this place  was amazing and had reasonable prices.  My husband ordered the carrot cake pancakes...super delicious. The red velvet was also very yummy. Large portions. Friendly staff and fast food service. Next time I visit Las Vegas I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Tried them for breakfast this morning, and we'll definitely be back.  I had the Spinach Eggs Benedict and a sweet cream crepe with bananas.  The crepe was amazing!!  I had a hard time tasting the flavor of the hollandaise, but I'm developing a cold, so that might be why.  The potatoes on the side were delicious and the service was great.  My friends liked their pancakes and everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I will NEVER go back! The first time was ok. The place is super tiny, dirty, and decor is torn. We had to wait a long time till our food came out and when it did I wasn't too impressed compared to all the good things I had heard. I thought I'd give it another chance with the boyfriend this time because he loves breakfast food. As soon as we walked in I regretted it. It was dirty and kind of embarrassing because I had chosen where we were to eat. We got seated by the door and were FORGOTTEN about. No one came by, looked at us, acknowledged us, or gotten us water. They must have clearly seen us sitting there. We were so irritated, but didn't want to drive elsewhere. I walked up to the front counter and explained that we have been waiting 15 minutes and no one has helped us. No one felt bad at all. We finally got a waitress who rushed us and made us feel like a burden. Needless to say it ruined my meal, and frankly my morning. I've never had worse service. Fast food has been better! I don't mean to be harsh, but that is NOT customer service."}
{"text":"Pancakes were really fluffy and sweet. I also loved the Hawaiian/breakfast food combo. I ordered a spam, rice, and mac salad with a side of blueberries pancakes. Sounds weird but its yummy. Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food is good but comes with some baggage. I understand what they try to do by opening your food up before they bag it but I don't feel comfortable with that. I expressed that I don't need them to open the containers and they STILL do it. Smh! After all the theatrics I would expect nothing to be missing like utensils or syrup for my pancakes but that's not the case. Make sure to remind them of what you need to eat your meal. I have tried several items on the menu and they hit on really good quality about 3 out of 5 times hence the rating. I keep going back for convenience. Favorite dish is the honey French toast when it doesn't come soggy. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"This morning the food was really good.  Babystacks was starting to become a hit or miss restaurant but this morning which was around 8am, we had a chance to sit down immediately and was greeted right away.  Bianca took our orders and answered all the questions that I had regarding the menu.  (I always have questions.) The presentation and portion was beautiful and the food tasted really good.  The restaurant was clean and it us reaffirmed this restaurant as a good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Waiting 45 minutes for anything in life is a pain in the ass.  Waiting 45 minutes for probably the best breakfast I've had in recent memory, no problem!  For patrons that may be concerned about the wait, don't be, the time you lose waiting for a table is quickly gained back as the food comes out within five minutes of it being ordered.

Babycakes Cafe is situated within a small strip mall, the wait is long because the food is amazing and the venue is pretty small.   If you don't mind rubbing elbows with hungry Las Vegans and don't get claustrophobic easily, Babycakes is worth a shot.

The menu is plentiful, most notably, Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict and the Red Velvet pancakes which come with a cream cheese frosting.  The pancakes themselves are very light and fluffy with a \"melt in your mouth\" type of consistently.

45 minutes.....worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nice local breakfast place off the strip. Works out well if you're heading up to Mount Charleston. Both types of French toast are good. Get the whole wheat if you like a crunchy coating. It's a small place so come early."}
{"text":"Casual and comfortable resturant environment. Good food, polite and attentive staff.  I sat at the counter, because there was a wait for a table and I was eating alone. Most breakfast come with pancakes or toast. I ordered corned beef hash and eggs with garlic rice vs potato's for a small up-charge. They have a good selection of pancake types.  The staff is cordial and frequently checks in on you to see if you need anything. My server JoAnn did a wonderful job, happy to add this place to my regular eateries. The only negative for me was the coffee, either the water is not being filtered well and or the coffee used is not the best or both- This is an easy fix for the resturant. Being a breakfast place they should have a good quality fresh coffee, prepared with quality water."}
{"text":"-slow service
-food was rather expensive for what you ended up getting
-taste of food was just ok, nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"They do not take reservations and there was a long wait on Sunday even at 130pm. Inside waiting area was full and several more waiting outside. I did appreciate the hostess requiring for everyone in the party to be there before they put them down on the list. 

Then came an unfortunate bad judgment call by the hostess while we were waiting to get seated.  At some point someone left and when they came back  the hostess gave them the next table. Not fair to those that stayed and were patiently waiting.  It delayed our seating as they already were playing Tetris to fit our party of 6.  Six parties that came in after us were seated (3 of them taking the rare and precious larger tables - but not the patrons fault but they felt our pain - even one person advised that we were here way before them)

Had egg white omelet with chicken spinach and mushrooms. Came with potatoes. No cheese but included for same $9.25 price.  Egg whites are $1.25 extra. Senior breakfast well worth it $6.95 for two eggs, side of meat potatoes and 2 pancakes. Can substitute for toast. Eggs were done perfect.  Server came to the table to get drink order right as soon as we sat down. When he dropped off our drinks took our food order and about 10 minutes later the food came out. Everything the way we requested.  Niece ordered abobo omelet. Was better this time. Last time was a bit salty for my taste but was told that's normal (that adobo in general is slightly salty not that is how the restaurant prepares it)

Food 4 stars
Server 4 stars - got everything perfect and technically didn't need anything but never checked back on us
Having to wait longer due to bad judgment and making excuses why they thought they had to which will cause me never to come back  0 stars"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! My husband and I ate here today. I had the red velvet pancakes and he had the banana pancakes. We both ate every last bite! I was also very pleased that the server brought us a sliced banana for my 16 month old son! We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Chill people & great food. The red velvet pancakes are simply amazing! I usually grub on the Loco Moco  but everything here is good. The wife digs the Heavos Rancheros. There is always a wait but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"It was OK.  Food was sort of average.  Mom and pop atmosphere.  I had an omelette and my hubby had the pork benedict.  The omelette was what you'd ecpect, but the benedict had no flavor to the sauce. 

The restaurant looked clean and the decor was nice.  The hostess was very nice and friendly as was the waitress.  The place is kid friendly and family oriented.  The food was not bad but nothing too special.  I read rave reviews about the red velvet pancakes, but red dye in food scares the pee outta me!"}
{"text":"Service great but after waiting an hour to eat, I was expecting the food to be better. I had the Loco Moco with garlic rice. The garlic and onions in the rice were still raw making it's flavor overpowering. Also tried the spam sliders and was underwhelmed. The Cinnabon pancakes were delicious. Maybe the sweets are the way to go."}
{"text":"Even on a Friday at 11 am this small location is packed!  We had German chocolate short stack and bananas foster short stack with sides of eggs and Portuguese sausage. Everything was perfect and delicious. Pancakes came out still steaming. I had never heard of Portuguese sausage but it reminds me of kielbasa - so much flavor. Highly recommend earing here! Flawless."}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast i've ever had.  The red velvet pancakes were incredible and all the food tasted incredible."}
{"text":"The manager here sucks. The waitress put items on our check that we didn't order and when I tried to talk to the manager about the issue she ignored me and made us pay for it anyway. Don't waste your money here unless you want horrible service."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this place for the first time, but I was disappointed. I ordered the Kalua Grilled Cheese with a short stack order of the Cinnabun pancakes. The sandwich had no flavor. I attempted to add flavor by adding ketchup to the first half which was gross and then I added Cholula to the second half which was also gross. Maybe, I'm ignorant to the style of cooking Kalua Pig, but it just tasted like plain meat. The Cinnabun pancakes were served with some icing drizzled and crumbled pecans on top, but there was so cinnamon. I guess I was expecting a cinnamon roll in pancake form. I did get a taste of the S'mores pancakes and those were really good. I suppose I would have to visit again and try another item on their menu."}
{"text":"During a weekend of overeating and trying new places we opted for a brunch and the much talked about, highly Yelp rated Babycakes Cafe. We \"trekked\" across the valley with the anticipation of a 1 hour wait. 

We were quoted 45 minutes, but because there were some larger parties in front of us we were seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Excellent. 

The venue is pretty small but again, Yelp prepared me for that too. Here is what the family ordered: 

Mom: eggs and sausage. She said the link sausage was excellent. 

Dad: corn-beef hash. He also said this was excellent! 

Hubs: biscuits and gravy, side of Adobo Fried Rice. Both were great and bonus the gravy is homemade. 

Me: Mexican omelet. Yummers! The pico, sour cream and jalapenos made it. 

Table: short stack of red velvet pancakes. WOW! Super light, not too sweet. I thought for sure they would be a sugar OD, but not at all. We were all impressed and surprised at how great they were. A must try for first timers for sure! 

I really wish this was closer to home so we could go more often, but I do believe it was well worth the drive and I know we will be back again."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced in my life!! My family and I waited for our food for an hour. An item that was ordered, that required little time was the very last item to come out. While people that got seated after us got there order before we did!! We were sat at a table in a tight spot even though there was many more empty ones as we did go when the rush hour was done. Honestly, I would have just walked out. I hope the employees are ashamed of the way in which they treated us and learn how to be hospitable."}
{"text":"Visited on 7/29 luckily no line. I had the biscuit and gravy with poached eggs. The gravy had a sweet taste to it, off putting. On a good note server asked me how I wanted my egg never been asked that for poached eggs. My hubby had the Mexican omelette. Eggs were over cooked and carnitas had no taste. He also had red velvet pancakes on the side. He loved it. It was fluffy. I didn't like it, it's red velvet should have cream cheese icing not powdered sugar."}
{"text":"How can you review this place? They have over 500 reviews. All I gots to say....you, baby stacks.... you had the pleasure of having me walk through those doors of yours.  And me, leave my money after I stuffed my pie hole with your flap jacks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places to come to.  Makes me feel like I'm back home and he food is excellent.  Can't order one bad thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast here and I see a Yelp sticker on the door so I downloaded the app. The staff is welcoming, it seems they enjoy their job. The art work is really nice at this location also. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We came in here once before and got great service and food so we decided since we were in the area to come by again and sure enough the service was impeccable and the food was great again!!! Amanda is amazing and I really enjoy all of the Hawaiian infused options!! Keep it up guys! You're amazing!!!"}
{"text":"it's so mouthwatering good no matter how sweet your tooth is or not. the food and service keeps you coming back for more .missing there pancakes"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try BabyStacks for sometime, but we finally got over there to give it a try on Saturday afternoon. We were seated at the counter since the tables were full. We didn't mind it. We looked over the menu and the husband chose the Mexican Skillet ($9.95) with Red Velvet pancakes ($1.50). I went with a short order of Banana Cream Pie pancakes ($5.75). Everything was really delicious. The skillet was the perfect blend of savory flavors, the red velvet pancakes followed like dessert and the banana cream pie pancakes weren't overly sweet - thankfully, I was nervous. It was a nice treat. Our server was new and still learning the ropes, but very friendly and attentive. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Babystacks on Blue Diamond twice so far and I have been very impressed with the food and service. The price is also reasonable. The portions are great. Great variety of pancake flavors. Definitely will continue to return."}
{"text":"Great menu, and the Orange Creamsicle pancakes I ordered were very tasty (and original).  Reasonable prices, and friendly staff.  One thing I did notice it things were somewhat disorganized.  I saw lots of open seating, but they were too slow to seat people, even with the 15-30min wait list that was quite long.  What I found odd was the counter seating was not available for walk-up, but rather had to put your name on the list.  I am curious to try other dishes next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. And friendly service. I will definitely stop by again if I'm in the area in the morning. Their hash brown and Portuguese sausage was really good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE we are 2 young african american women in a restaurant who barely had any people in it at 9am we ordered at 910am and watched as every other table that was sat down after us had gotten their food. All the other people in the restaurant were either white or asian and were all served before us. The table next to us who ordered about 5mins before us was served, paid their check, and the table was cleaned and set up by the time HALF of our food finally came out at 950am. I told the server we would no longer be eating there and it seemed like she could care less. She said she would get the manager and we waited for 5 mins before getting up and walking out. DO NOT EAT HERE they discriminate!"}
{"text":"Got to the place around 1015am and it was busy (a good sign). Walt was only 30 minutes. Food was out in about 15 minutes and the selection was great. All in all the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS packed so get there early! It is totally worth the wait, the portions are more than sufficient and the atmosphere is super family friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable place to eat. It's simple and comfortable. The service was great, we were seated promptly and were very well taken care of. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was hittin' it. Definitely going to eat there again."}
{"text":"The location on blue diamond seems is great.  I got the spam scrabble, adobo chicken fried rice and the buttermilk pancakes! The service was great and  food was delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and the breakfast food selection was amazing.    Chocolate mocha pancakes were amazing.    My wife had an egg white omelette that was also great."}
{"text":"Hawaiian style breakfast. Spam and eggs, spam sliders. Not bad at all. Don't come with groups larger than 4. There is only one table for groups 4+ and they will sit everybody else before that one table clears."}
{"text":"I'm still trying to figure out the hype. This was our second time going and my second time being less than satisfied. 

Their unique-ness comes from their huge variety of pancakes (everything from savory, like bacon pancakes to sweet, like Nutella pancakes, bananas foster, etc). 

The good:
The honey French toast was amazing! Homemade whipped cream, huge slices. Delicious. My husband really liked the bananas foster pancakes, the skillet meal, and the huevos rancheros (ordered over the two trips). The sausage patties & links were both good, though I'd only order the patties again. 

The okay: The Nutella crêpes I ordered were fine, but I didn't think anything special. 

The disappointing: Besides being pretty pricey for such a small, home style establishment (the menu is almost a la carte style), the service was definitely lacking. If I'm going to pay $25+ for a breakfast meal for two people, I expect either a lot of food (enough to be VERY filling or leftovers) OR great customer service OR even absolutely fantastic food. This place had none of the above. The entire time we ate, the previous tables' tip was at the table. We reminded the server SEVERAL times to tell the other server. It was STILL there when we left. Unprofessional. The bacon pancakes were disappointing. They boast pancakes filled with bacon. More like, a few bacon crumbs on top and maybe one or two \"inside\" the pancake (laying in the middle of two). 

I don't think we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It was our first visit in this morning.  We went in around 10am and surprisingly were seated right away.  I say surprisingly cause the place is super tiny.  The food wasn't terrible just not all that great.  Me & the fam just stuck to the basics.  I ordered two eggs over medium w/ turkey sausage patties & seasoned potatoes, my husband ordered the mexican burrito & my son had the kid's meal: one egg, one turkey bacon that was burnt to a crisp, seasoned potatoes & juice.  Our entrees came w/ buttermilk pancakes as well, that were too dry & overcooked.  Our server was really good but I wasn't really impressed w/ the place cause 1) Food was bland, I could make better at home 2) Iced tea was super diluted, tasted like water 3) Seating is too crammed 4) Noise level is loud & so annoying 5) The two cashiers at check out were not very efficient, they seemed rather disorganized & confused.   That said, we probably won't be back anytime soon.  Bum deal cause we live so close."}
{"text":"We had stopped at a few places just wanting a great breakfast. The buffet in Palms wasnt even open! (In their defense it was 630 am) so, we googled 'breakfast Las Vegas'. Babystacks, listed 3rd, was our second choice but won out because it was closer and I loved the name.
So, here we are; first in the door and i have my coffee, so far so good. The sweet sounds or reggae make us smile and relax. The places has quickly filled up as i patiently waited my PB & J pancakes and portugués sausage. My cousin and her friend are anticipating equally exciting combinations including garlic rice (yummy!). ... .. ...(insert smacking, laughing, &enjoying here). The ambiance was perfect, the food devine. 
Not that it mattered after an absolutely satisfying meal like this, but the prices were completly affordable. The entire staff was on top of their customer service with pride.  I will def be back next time im in town, which is hopefully Sooner rather than later. 
Ps. \"The bathroom was clean, fully stocked, and very well put together\" -Queen Truthe 
\"The Portugués sausage is.. To die for!\" -Lady Poet"}
{"text":"I love this place be sure to have your entire party there or they don't seat you ... But it's worth the wait I like their unique pancake options and even their toasts :)"}
{"text":"The pancakes were fresh and tasty. Those are what they are known for. 

The rest of my breakfast was merely ok. Scrambled eggs were a bit burnt, not yellow and fluffy. The potatoes were under seasoned and appeared to be the cubed frozen kind. 

Coffee was just ok. 

I may come back to try the pancakes again. Service was quick and the host was super nice."}
{"text":"Kalua pork eggs benedict and red velvet pancakes were both very delicious and creative.  The regular breakfast food like hashbrowns and scrambled eggs were done very well.  Waiting to get seated was a time killer, but once we ordered, our food came out very quick.  Portions are not humongous like Omelet house or Original pancake house, Babycakes Cafe portions are decent and therefore reasonably priced.  I will be back for the Hawaiian, Filipino, American breakfast fusion."}
{"text":"WOW! What a huge disappointment. I believed all of those glowing remarks, but was confronted with a completely different experience. 

The kitchen lacks the talent and skill to create and execute traditional breakfast plates. My omlette was made like a pancake, then folded over in half and topped with sliced cheese. The eggs were cooked like a crepe and tasted thin and secondary. The ingredients did not have any interesting or fresh flavors. The meal tasted processed and assembled. BabyStacks should only focus on the pancakes because the other breakfast items are a fail. A waste of money. 

The staff is adequate and the decor is pleasant, but there isn't anything special or inspiring about this place."}
{"text":"every time I have a trip to Vegas, I make it a priority to stop by here at least once! I'm from California so we don't have this restaurant around where I am. Super delicious food, great menu! The wait can be a little long sometimes but definitely worth it! 5/5"}
{"text":"OMG this place is so good. My friend and I went yesterday for the first time and I really enjoyed it. The wait is long but worth it. I had the sausage and eggs breakfast with a small stack of banana pancakes so good."}
{"text":"This place is a must every time we are in town. The adobo fried rice is delicious and so is the Portuguese sausage and eggs. The pancakes are the best I've had and the service is great. It's not close to the strip, but it is absolutely worth the 10 minute drive. I dream of this place when I'm craving good breakfast. It's that good."}
{"text":"**Found a rubber band in my food!** So 1 star for health and sanitation.

No mimosas,  or waffles. 
Overall mediocre
Tables are really cramped

Although they were busy our server gave great service and apologized for the rubber band."}
{"text":"First eating here and it was so yummy. I had the Banana's Foster pancakes. Delicious."}
{"text":"I waited an hour to seat myself and a friend. The food wasn't too filling either despite the price, but the food tasted good. The service was also fast, which makes me wonder why the wait to be seated is so long.

I got the HM1(FMF) skillet (I don't know what that stands for), which contained seasoned ground pork, bacon, green onion, cilantro, and Swiss cheese. The price was $9.50 and the portion wasn't as big as I had hoped. The flavor was fine, but the portion fell short of what I had expected for the price and the quality of the food wasn't that spectacular enough to make up for the lack of portion.

If you're thinking about trying to place, come between lunch and dinner for a shorter wait time.  It's a nice restaurant in the middle of Henderson, but there's a breakfast place across that street that might give you a better experience."}
{"text":"Forget about Hash-Hash-a-Go-Go! BabyStacks cleans their clock. Everything here has a fresh and bright flavor. PB and ? (your choice) pancakes are solid fare. Portuguese sausage and eggs is spot on. Egg scrambles are delicious. Waffles, while not as varietal as Waffle Cafe are the best in town. Try the strawberry Belgium waffle if you want a light and fluffy well grilled waffle, with fresh strawberries and strawberry compote. This is a spot worth driving to. Make the trip away from The Strip, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast.

Family place run by a hard working, friendly family!

Great food & great atmosphere!

Always enjoy it!

I recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I saw this place pop up on my Instagram feed so I wanted to check it out while in Vegas. 1st stop off the plane, here we are. It was \"ok\"...not nearly as good as the pictures made it look. I thought it was going to be a diner setting...it was more like ihop. It wasn't all the way bad, I just wouldn't come back or recommend it. The service was good though."}
{"text":"A friend of our who lives in Vegas told us about this place. The wait wasn't too bad. We had about a group of 7 and the food didn't take long to come out either. The servers are very friendly. I ordered the Corn beef hash and eggs. Came with a side of pancakes and rice. All I can say if this was great comfort food for me. Food was great and very reasonably priced. Will definitely be back to try the adobo fried rice omelet even though I tried some off my friends plate."}
{"text":"Nice lil' place near me. Staff is nice, and the food is pretty good. Few times ive decided to take my food to go because the seating was bad. Over all service, and food is a high 4 to me."}
{"text":"Came here about two weeks ago and have been trying to put in my review! This is as good as it gets! The red velvet are out of this world! We also tried the blueberry and carrot cake pancake which were also spectacular. Plus, one of our servers, Chris was very attentive and kind. Definitely a go to!"}
{"text":"OMG that was the best French toast I have ever had. We need one of these in Tucson. They put the whip cream on the side which was good. Service is great. Everyone helps each other out. My coffee was never empty. All drinks were filled all the time. . My grandson got the pumpkin pancakes they were wonderful. The bacon is great. We will make this a regular place every time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazingggggg breakfast spot! Two egg breakfast with a side of banana foster pancakes! Amazing food and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Our table got skillets and pancakes. Make sure to get the short stack which is 3 pancakes. The full is six. Red velvet are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Had a short wait, but well worth it. Pancakes were delicious. I got smores and hubby got PB&J. I wanted to try orange dreamsicle, but apparently they are removing that from the menu. Boo hoo."}
{"text":"Before I lived in Vegas, I always made sure to come here whenever I'd visit. Now I go any time I want Hawaiian breakfast, or pretty much any time I am in the area and am hungry. So I guess I come here often. The service is always amazing, and of course the food is always great. I'm from Hawaii so whenever I eat here, it seriously is like I am back home.

My go to at home, and here in the mainland, has always been portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. However, when I bring friends here I always tell them that anything and everything is good because I have never had anything here that I would not have again. Whether it's the pancakes, crepes, meals with rice, omelets, ANYTHING! Also make sure to try their strawberry lemonade. It is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Recommended by my doctor. Great place for Hawaii visitors! Prices are reasonable. Red velvet pancakes are winnah'z . Definitely looking forward to eating here on my next visit"}
{"text":"I was so happy when this location opened! Their red velvet pancake and ricks adobo fried rice are just YUM! Hopefully they can make the place bigger."}
{"text":"This place has great breakfast every time I come to Las Vegas we come here for there breakfast to be specific. They are very busy so I do recommend coming right when they open but other than that this is by far one of the top breakfast places I have been too."}
{"text":"Pure sanity and lovely service, sweet and savory all in one. My waitress, Blanca, was a doll. I had coffee while I waited. Come here to get your mode back after a night of losing. Emerge a satisfied winner"}
{"text":"Would of given it  5 stars but the acustics are hard on the head very loud. But the pancakes top notch great service and nice decor"}
{"text":"agreed to have a little lunch date with my best friend today and drove all the way from summerlin to try this place out. wow! this place has an at-home feel to it and a modern look on the inside that i loved. the menu consisted of many options from pancakes to crepes to omelets. was most impressed with how patient the staff was when my friend chuckled and told me this cafe closes at 3...& it was 2:25! always hate being 'that customer' but the server was a delight the whole time.
10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Two things make Babystacks stand out:

1) unique breakfast options
2) small, delicious pancakes

I thoroughly enjoyed their adobo rice wrapped in egg, Portuguese sausage, and lemon ricotta pancakes. I was worried about getting an unnecessarily large pancake to contented with. Instead, I ordered a modified stack and got two small, thin pancakes. They were moist with a hint of lemon. 

But for me it was all about the rice. The rice was a vision. Inspired. It is the reason to come back to the restaurant. It was slightly salty and well seasoned. 

Hubby ordered the sliders, but wasn't impressed with the lack of meat (spam) in the dish.

I will be back. But I don't plan to try anything new. I feel like I discovered the best dishes (for me) and I can't wait to go back to have them again."}
{"text":"Came here expecting it to be great since I've been coming to this place multiple times in the past and was let down hugely, pancakes didn't have anything in the batter and my gf's pancakes were under cooked and doughy and they re made it a 2nd time for it to be The exact same way with some green stuff in it both times. Also potatoes and her skillet were room temperature and had to ask for it to be reheated along with a new batch of seasoned potatoes that were hot. I don't know what happened here but DO NOT COME"}
{"text":"Babystacks is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. The red velvet pancakes are phenomenal with the cream cheese frosting, and their seasoned potatoes have awesome flavor. This is the only restaurant I have cleaned my plate at continuously. Be warned about the wait though- it's often 30+ minutes, even on weekday mornings, but well worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so drug my brother in for brunch before grocery shopping. The place is nice a little cramped but clean. However service stinks, oeople that came in after us got served before us. Our waiter was nice, but it was slow and he kept dissapearing. I ordered the kalua grilled cheese my brother the mecican skillet with a short order of carrot cake pancakes. It took 40 minutes for our food. It was hot my grilled cheese was great my hashbrowns perfect my brother said his skillet was ok that he had better. We were both done with our plates and no pancakes. We waited 10 more min the waiter came out with them. His apology \"sorry for the wait but at least their fresh\" rubbed us the wrong way. I really wanted to like this place but the service stinks. I will not be hoing back."}
{"text":"If you've been to the original Babystacks (nee Babycakes) off of Smoke Ranch, you know there's a price to pay for amazing gourmet pancakes: the wait can be upwards to an hour. But once you're seated, the food is delish, the service is stellar, and the clientele includes a lot of cute Islander boys.

OK, maybe it's just me that noticed that.

Well, Babystacks has a new location off of Stephanie in Henderson. The food is still delish, the service is still stellar, the Islander boys are still cute...

And we walked right in. **gasp**

I went off the pancake menu (finally) and gave their omelettes a try, opting for my beloved chili omelette. They boasted Hawaiian-style chili, which was even sweeter than a Chicago or Cincinnati chili, but still really good. I added a babystack of S'Mores pancakes. If i had one complaint about the place, it's that I thought adding a babystack of pancakes would get me 2 regular-sized pancakes. Instead, they're mini-pancakes.

Boo your face. If I had known that, I would have stuck with the pancakes and tell the omelette, \"Excuse you, buster, do you know where you're at? I need pancakes and I need them right meow.\"

But I digress. That was the only downside to our experience. Elite Emily had the Adobo Fried Rice, which has been widely lauded elsewhere, and she enjoyed it, though she had the same reaction to her Red, White, and Blue babystack pancakes.

Our server was great, and she kept us refilled with a big smile. The place feels new and clean -- a good thing since it just opened.

I definitely will come back. Carrot cake pancakes, you're next on my hit list."}
{"text":"Food is always great here! We brought our out of towner visitors here and they loved it as well. We ordered the Adobo fried rice, Nutella crepes and loco moco! Each meal was just on point and delicious. Definitely our go to Brunch joint!"}
{"text":"Awesome ! 
Pancakes are bomb. The kalua grilled cheese is fire. Highly recommend the red velvet and Cinnabon ones. I added strawberries to add some tartness on the Cinnabon for an additional fee. I recommend this location because I went to another and the pancakes were on the dry side. Only downside is that there's usually a wait and after ordering it takes a while to get your food."}
{"text":"Get there early. With limited sitting and hungry morning people, you're in for a wait on the waiting list, but it's all worth it once you take a bite off your red velvet pancakes (yum) & the Benedict are superb"}
{"text":"A pretty good Breakfast spot in Las Vegas. We were visting for a few days and since we rented a car decided to grab some food off the strip. Yelp led me to BabyStacks Cafe. This restaurant has a large selection of different types of pancakes, almost any type you could ask for. They have red velvet pancakes, Banana Cream pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, and many more! They also have lunch options too, so just because someone is not wanting breakfast in your group, does not mean you cant come here!"}
{"text":"My meal was OK, but nothing stood out.  I ordered the Cowboy Omelet, which had ham, onions, peppers, mushrooms and cheese.  This was served with hashbrowns and two pancakes.  It was plenty of food, but I think of an omelet as eggs on the outside, filling in the middle.  What they gave me was more like a scramble with the eggs and ham and such all mixed together before cooking.
Both the green peppers and the hashbrowns would have benefited from further cooking.  But overall the food tasted OK.  My service was good and food was prompt, but the coffee was mediocre."}
{"text":"We always come here for breakfast I love that you can get a meal and add 2 pancakes for super cheap!! The breakfast burrito is reallyyyyy good I get it with green sauce and banana cream pancakes my son is obsessed with the red velvet pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast! Definitely having breakfast here every time I visit Las Vegas. Friendly staff along with good prices."}
{"text":"Wow! Rick's adobo rice wrapped with omelette is a bomb!!!! 
The wait is not that bad on a Saturday around lunch time. Food is exceptional! Service is fast!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast to go because it gets so crowded here.  I had the red velvet pancakes and my boyfriend had the carrot cake pancakes.  The side of sausage is tasty too.  I plan on trying some of their other unique creations!"}
{"text":"Loved the blueberry pancakes and French toast. Reasonably priced, good quality food, nice portions and great customer service."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy. So fluffy, rich, and hearty. I've only been here twice but both times have been amazing. It's always busy, which is expected because they're only open until 2 or 3 PM. Service is always good and friendly. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pancakes were good. Service was average. Not a bad atmosphere inside for being on a strip mall. Not good enough to go out of my wag to go back"}
{"text":"Had to wait for a table got no acknowledgement from the hostess at all regarding wether or not a table was getting prepared for me but the waiter made it up with wonderful service and good food will definitely come back again only because the food is worth it not the service"}
{"text":"Saturday visit, created a stressful experience for me.  Not orgianized, service was less than average, my server I think needed a good night sleep, maybe out too late the night before... the wait time was unexceptable.  Now on to the food.... overpriced breakfast with below average food.  Maybe it was an off day but it was my first visit and I think it will take me ...never to come back.  Cold eggs, soggy toast and all without a smile."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. Every creation of pancakes they have on the menu is delicious. This place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious. Dropped by for breakfast with mom. She had the corned beef hash and I had the steak and eggs with a side of white chocolate macadamia pancakes (love that you can get specialty pancakes for a small additional fee). Our server was friendly and helpful. The restaurant is a nice cozy size and has a warm sunny feeling to it. Our food was AWESOME. I'm not usually crazy about pancakes but these may have made me a pancake convert. They were light and fluffy and not too sweet. The flavours were great without too much syrup. My steak was a little overcooked but the taste made up for it. The hashbrowns were nice and crispy. Wonderful meal; I will be back very very soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fried steak with garlic rice and a baby stack of red velvet pancakes.  I have to say it was the best chicken fried steak I ever had. Definitely going back for some more. Red velvet was okay. I still think the grand lux cafe at the palazzo has the best red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Baby stacks has the best Adobe fried rice in town... Amazing atmosphere, n if you love reggae music you will die.  Hawaiian reggae music, great food, just bring some good friends n let the good times roll"}
{"text":"Well my boyfriend & I decided to have breakfast yesterday at Babystacks. I had been there before when they first opened, back when they were called Babycakes. It was a Thursday, mid-morning, and we were greeted right away by a woman who sat us. She was very nice. I ordered the \"homemade\" corn beef hash & eggs & I got the red velvet pancakes. The red velvet pancakes are divine. If you like red velvet, you'll love these. I've had lots of RV pancakes & these are by far the best. The corn beef has looked like a cube of dog food. I've had corn beef hash a lot & this wasn't that great, neither were the eggs which were a strange color. The hash browns were undercooked & bland. My boyfriend got the Mexican skillet which also looked underwhelming & wasn't that great, according to him & he is an authentic Mexican. Haha. The portions were small & it was expensive. The reason I'm giving it 3 out of five stars is for their pancakes, which they're famous for, and our excellent service. Our server (I wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shoutout) was amazing. She was happy, friendly, and very attentive. The service from everyone I saw was amazing. I'll go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and it's always good. I used to go across town on buffalo just to have breakfast there. Im so happy they opened one in this area which is five minutes away .They have the best red velvet pancakes . Portuguese sausage is really good too. The wait is long sometimes ,  but definitely worth it. Service is ok , friendly and accommodating ."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, first off was seated and never greeted by the waitstaff, then a table beside us got seated and they were greeted by the waitress and she took the drink order while we had yet to be waited on or our drink order taken, then the waitress had a attitude toward us when we asked her about it. If this is how you operate your establishment here baby's tacks, this will be the first and only time I will come here.

The food was mediocre ..I ordered the cowboy omelet with salsa, well the salsa didn't look like salsa so I didn't even touch it. The baby stacks pancakes had no flavor to it. Actually none of the food had no flavor at all. If I wasn't hungry I would of sent it all back. This will be the last time I come here..Maria was the worst server I had"}
{"text":"Didn't care for the pancakes. Had the plain and Red Velvet which separated when dipped in the sauce leaving the bottom skin in the sauce. It then turned  pasty in my mouth sticking to the roof of my mouth. Luckily service was good and my coffee was frequently refilled.  

Ricks Adobo Fried Rice was delicious. 

Chicken fried steak was \"ok\" according to my brother. 

Found a number of breakfast places this trip. Unfortunately Babystacks was not one of them.  Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time. The experience was disappointing. I think I would take the long drive to summerlin instead. 1. The place was so busy, we waited 45 min to get our take out order. 2. The pancakes weren't as flavorful. Idk maybe it was just busy. I will have to give this location another try."}
{"text":"I friggin' love this place.  Yes, that is correct, love the place.

BabyStacks is the number one place for breakfast when visiting Vegas.  It is the place I take friends and travel companions when in town and to a person they are pleased with the meal. That is because the staff members are all pleasant, the food is tasty and prepared quickly.  While everything is good, I recommend ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes (there are enough to share with the \"friend\" you met last night, or flew into town with). The coffee is always hot, fresh, smooth, and your cup will never be empty.

Don't be put off by the simple exterior and location.  This place has the feel of a family run restaurant (and probably is) and they make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Oh, and did mention I love this place because the food is oh so good.

So, if you are a Vegas local, give it a try.  If you are a visitor to Sin City, make a tiny extra effort, travel west on Flamingo and turn south on Buffalo.  It is on the corner just south of a drug store in a strip mall.  Pull in, walk in, enjoy. There are two locations in Vegas, but the one on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo is the location I am familiar with."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about baby stacks for some time now and when i found out they had a location closer to me at Buffalo and Flamingo, I decided to finally give them a try.

When i go to breakfast places, I try to steer clear of ordering stuff i can make at home...spam and eggs, Portuguese sausage and eggs, etc etc.  I always try to go for stuff that I can't make or would take too much effort to make.  Pancakes are not hard to make but the creativity that baby stacks has come up with forced me to order them, lol!

We had the velvet pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes and the corned beef hash.  

red velvet pancakes: they were good, not spectacular like most people here say, but definitely good.  They came with a cream cheese sauce and I noticed most people were pouring the entire thing on their pancakes, lol.  Yeah, they were good but all of it was too sweet for me. 

The banana cream pie pancakes were really good.  banana slices, a banana type sauce, almonds and a whipped cream that tasted like it was infused with banana.  If they only added some chocolate too! mmmm.........

The corned beef hash said that it was homemade on the menu but it looked like and tasted like the canned stuff.  I think the best corned beef hash still belongs to Black Bear Diner...

Overall a great experience and we will be back.  We're looking forward to trying the kalua pig benedict, chicken adobo omelet, etc.  

p.s. for any Hawaii Peeps out there, their banana cream pie pancakes tasted exactly like the banana mac pancakes from BOOTS N KIMOS in Kailua!  I think the chef here used to work there or something, lol!"}
{"text":"I'm here a lot. Julie and Cora that work in the front are amazing. They stay busy so be prepared for a wait, but they turn tables fast and bring your food just as fast. I work in the parking lot so I go a lot ... I have not had a bad dish yet. I mean where can you get German chocolate pancakes like this?!!!"}
{"text":"\"Waaaaaiting is the hardest part.\"  

Tom Petty says it best, when he sings the chorus to his song \"The Waiting.\" This also sums up the experience you'll have at BabyStacks.  

There is no doubt that BabyStacks has the biggest selection of creative pancakes in town.  The panacea of pancakes changes often, but expect to find staples like Red Velvet, Lemon-Ricotta, and S'mores on the menu when you dine.  Besides lots of pancakes, BabyStacks also stays true to it's Hawaiian roots with breakfast grinds like Loco Moco, Spam fried rice, and Kahlua Pork omelets.  


The place is very small, and can feel cramped, especially during a busy weekend rush.  If you don't have the sweet tooth of a five year old, you may want to pass on the pancakes, and go for something savory.  On my last visit, I kept it simple, and went with some scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, and toast.  Everything was good, not great, and for the 30 minutes we waited  to get our food, after waiting about 20 to sit down, and another 10 for our coffee, it just wasn't worth it. 


Breakfast doesn't need to be a whole production, and the food isn't good enough to warrant the wait and the potential cramped seating.  

BabyStacks is worth trying, but not frequenting."}
{"text":"Yum!  Order the garlic fried rice with . . . everything!  We've been there twice and everything we've tried so far has been so good, I can't wait to go back -- and we live in L.A.!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet pancakes...  It was yummy!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast this past Tuesday, 1/23/18...spent the night at Boulder Station Hotel/Casino on our way to Arizona to visit family.  We googled places to eat before leaving hotel and decided to try this restaurant.  We were both pleasantly surprised to find that they served Island style breakfast (I was born and raised in Hawai'i, part Hawaiian/Chinese).  Anyway I had spam/eggs with rice and sliced tomatoes instead of pancakes.  Later I found out they had macaroni salad...that would have been the perfect Island breakfast.  My husband had Portuguese sausage/eggs with rice and pancakes.  He said the pancakes were a little dense for him.  The rice was cooked perfectly.    Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and we were seated right away...had to move to another table because the sun was in my husband's face.  Will certainly consider stopping here again on another trip to Arizona."}
{"text":"I went recently for my first time. They have a big menu and great service. I had the omelet with Turkey sausage and it was great. The pancakes are also nice and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great breakfast choices, especially if you're Asian and like having rice options for breakfast.  Awesome service too."}
{"text":"The wait staff was good but the hostess and the man working the register are completely incompetent.  Tons of people waiting empty tables and nobody is being seated!!!  This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Forget Ihop, this place is 100x better!! The best pancakes on the menu are the Oreo ones, the banana fosters comes in second! Go here or else."}
{"text":"This little place is excellent. The omelets were pretty good and the pancakes were sooooooo good! :) Loved this place you should definitely come here. I had the Hazelnut Pancakes and there were also Banana Foster and Red Velvet Pancakes those were also very delicious. AMZING GIRLLLLLLLLLLLO!!!!YAYAYYAYAYAYYAY"}
{"text":"I have been to both locations twice, however I was not impressed.The red vevlet cakes are amazing.  The Huevos rancheros was so so, short stack buttermilk pancakes were rubbery and basic egg breakfast was ok.  Greeters and Server are great!"}
{"text":"Love their breaskfast.   I could eat everyday here since is just less than a mile from my house.  They're  pancakes are divine .  When we have bras fast here we prefer to go on weekdays ,  weekends are just too full maybe an hour or more wait."}
{"text":"I have now found a new spot for my occasional \"Cheat days\" at Babycakes Cafe. If it wasn't for Yelp I wouldn't have ever known this place existed. Obviously, by the look of everyone's review its screaming out RED VELVET PANCAKES!!! Once I saw those three words, I immediately bookmarked it! I was sooo stoked when my girlfriends and I went on Sunday morning. There were groups of people standing outside and my first thought was \"this place is serious.\" It was a bit of a drag with the wait time taking more than 30 mins since we were starving. So definitely must come early on weekends. 

I ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes of course. You have a choice of ordering the short stack (3 pancakes) or the big stack (6 pancakes). It was absolutely amazing. So fluffy. So velvety. And the cream cheese syrup adds the cherry on top. It was pure heaven in my mouth. I had one of those silent moments to myself for a good 3 mins (: I've gotten to try the Smores pancakes as well from my cousin's order. It was also good but it did not compare to the red velvet. 

I've also tried some of the Kalua Pig Benedict from one of my girlfriends, which has the toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. That was a good choice! The meat was tender and juicy. Plus adding ketchup and hot sauce to it made it more flavorful! I love spice. 

I was completely satisfied with my whole experience. The staff, the service, the quality of the food, and the atmosphere of Babycakes Cafe were fantastic! Spread the word... this place is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Formerly Babycakes, the place still lives up to its rep with some cah-razy good food. A friend had raved about their Red Velvet pancakes. Not only did I sample some of hers, but also the Carrot Cake and Banana Cream Pie pancakes the others in our group ordered. Fan-freakin'-tastic. Also tried the adobo fried rice, which could easily be mistaken for an omelete. The stuff is actually wrapped in egg. Ridonk. I ordered the Kalua Pork Benedict and patted myself on the back as soon as I took the first bite. I already love eggs Benedict, but that dish made me love it even more. Totally worth the 15 minute drive from The Strip. I'm set on a return visit real soon."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot by far great food and amazing service! All the staff is very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, but they need to chill out with there weird seating policy. They will NOT put tables together to seat 6 and they will not pull them apart to seat 2. And don't try to do it yourself when your seated. They will ask you to put it back. Weird and rude."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and had decent service with good food.  Unfortunately this wasn't the case during my recent visit.  My food was cold and when I told the staff they said, \"Ok, we'll tell the kitchen.\"  That's great for new guests but not for their current guest.   It will most likely be a while before I give it another try."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's very homey and the staff is very friendly.  The most popular is the red velvet pancakes, but the most to me the best one is the hazelnut pancake. Not to mention their banana foster pancake. Every time I come here it's very hard to decide because I can't decided what to get. I recommend this very time my visitors come here and they loved it."}
{"text":"I love the warm and the atmosphere here. It is always busy during lunch hour but it's worth the wait. My favorite is always the loco moco. I always upgrade to garlic rice and with upgrade pancakes!"}
{"text":"Babystacks has excellent food. Whenever I have family come into town, Babystacks is normally the first place they ask about."}
{"text":"What a great edition to the mountains edge area.  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun and the service was fast."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Baby Stacks, our first visit wasn't great, but we always like to give second chances.  BIG mistake.  Same problems, party of five, three got breakfast, than after some time the other two got part of their breakfast, then later the cold toast arrived and after asking twice  your jam arrived.  We wanted to have breakfast together at the same time.  It was not busy.  Don't know if it was waiter or kitchen, but is was not an enjoyable breakfast.  The FRIED eggs were wet with water, icky and the food was average.  So if service is important to you I would pass on BabyStacks."}
{"text":"decided to make Babycakes part of my NYE festivities since i was going to be in the north part of Vegas most of the day.  Besides, I have a couple Groupons to use.

So gf and i originally decide let's hit it before we go to Aliante to sign up for nye bingo and pick up tickets for the Journey cover band playing post-bingo at Aliante.

When we get to Babycakes, big surprise, the place is packed - 45 minute wait. We put our name in and take the chance to drive to Aliante and return in time for brekafast.  It did take 45 minutes but they already called our name - we did call them to ask that they move our name lower - they refused ...bummer.

so we get back t Babycakes - another 30 minutes .

We order the Rick's adobo rice , the pork bennie and we dshared a small stack of the red velevet pancakes.  Service was good - timely refills, food came out reasonably fast.

The food ?  mixed bag - the gf's adobo rice - i didn't notice on the menu - it's an omelet filled with fried rice.  I like the creativity but didn't quite get there on taste - i kinda laughed since it reminded me of an occasional sunday breakfast for me - take your leftovers from the night before and jam it into an omelet.

The pancakes were tasty - didn't need the whipped cream - again, a creative dish.

the pork bennie  - again, i like the creativity and i did like the saltiness of the pork mixed with the egg but it definitely needed more bernaise sauce  and the potatoes ??  for such a creative menu, the potatoes SUCKED ! 

I have another groupon so i'm sure i'll hit  Babycakes again but not sure if it's travel worthy."}
{"text":"They never disappoint. The wait can be a bit long esp on weekends. But its worth it. The lemon ricotta and carrot cake pancakes are my fav"}
{"text":"Good and bad. Good: Food was good, had the Piglet omelet with a babystack side. Omelet was pretty good, a little over done, but it was still good. Pancakes were very plain (I didn't order any fancy toppings) but I really like them that way. I'm kind of a purest in that sense. Stood on their own well. Service was fine. Neither good or bad.

Bad: This location felt REALLY dirty even at 8am and they had only been open an hour. Music was a hair too loud and was like a dance/hip-hop/rap mix. Kinda odd. Bathroom actually made me gag when I walked in there. I had to cover my mouth/nose with my shirt. Coffee was not good either. I have a REALLY low bar for coffee, especially at restaurants like this and this I couldn't drink. I kept sipping it hoping it would get better, but it was awful. I'm not sure how coffee can go bad, but that's kinda what it tasted like... dirty pot? Reheated from the night before? nasty water? I don't know, but I'm honestly not a coffee snob but this was really bad. I wouldn't NOT go back here (or try another location) but based on this experience it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"This is our 4th time at BS. We have had NO issues in till todsy. 
We wanted to treat our 11 yewr old daughter has NEVER been before.

My daughter and I both ordered Banana Creme Pie Pancakes.
I was  enjoying them until i kept finding these little green things in my pancakes.

I asked our server .. who was actually very nice and she said it was because when you put the bananas in the batter it turned green and the batter had been sitting a while.

She graciously asked if she could make another order but  by this time I had lost my appetite  and declined the offer.

After this I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"A great little breakfast spot - lots of different kind of pancakes.  I had the Red Velvet (Yum) with whipped cream and cream cheese icing.  A \"short stack\" was plenty!!  Hubby had french toast with eggs.  They have lots of breakfast specialties and Hawaiian items as well."}
{"text":"If you have trouble with cold in any way, bring an extra layer. Their AC WORKS! Food is good and reasonable price point, been here about three times. 

Asked server if they could season the steak and he looked confused. It became an 'issue.' , a small one, but still. They said they could put fajita seasoning on it which I said was fine. Never had a fuss before over wanting a steak sessoned."}
{"text":"\" my review is subjective\"

My group tried a little of everything.

Reasonable PRICES

Country Benedict         4.5 Stars
I have no complaints on this twist of an original. It was delicious combination of Eggs Benedict with biscuits and sausage and gravy and seasoned salt country potatoes!! I loved it all, nothing was left on my plate.

Basically this place is known for their variation on  homemade pancake batters. 
If you come here you have a to at least have a short stack. We wanted to try them all. But instead choose these three.

Red Velvet short stack  5 stars
Peanut Butter and Banana short stack 5 stars
Hazel Nut short stack 4 stars

I will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again. That's a given."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Every kind of pancake you can imagine. Good coffee and friendly service. I had a veggie omelette with English muffins cooked good and crispy. I substituted a big bowl of fruit for potatoes. They could use a better brand of Jan. I didn't know Heinz made jam. Pancakes were delicious according to my husband."}
{"text":"I just love Babystacks Cafe. The red velvet pancakes are to die for and my other favorite is the kahlua grilled cheese. Downside is they are incredibly busy on the weekends so be prepared to stand in line. Weekdays mornings are best."}
{"text":"O-M-G! I don't even know where to start. The place will blow your mind!  The point is, you just need to go!  Don't ask questions. Just go!  Everything about this place is worthy of 5 stars.  The food is delicious!  Red velvet pancakes, get it girl!  The service is wonderful everytime.  The facility is clean and the environment is relaxed and perfect for flavored pancakes and more!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 min to be seated on a very busy Easter Sunday, but once we were, our food came out fast and hot.  The waiter suggested the bananas foster pancakes when I asked what was the best one there, and he wasnt wrong! It was a specialty not on the menu and it was really good.  My son had the white chocolate chip pancake and my daughter had the red velvet pancakes.  They both loved them.  This was my 2nd time here and I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"We were heading in to town after a long night of driving.  We didn't want to eat on strip yet, so we found this little place... holy cow, SO worth it!!! I had Nutella crepes, and my boyfriend had a Portuguese sausage breakfast burrito.  We left full and happy!  Service was good, too. Highly recommend if you're looking for a great off strip breakfast spot."}
{"text":"German Chocolate and banana fosters pancakes were the bomb. We had the Mexican omelet too and that was delish. Would of gave it 5 stars but the staff rushed us out.. Maybe if we came in at 7am they would let us stay longer."}
{"text":"This place was a small mom and pop restaurant in a rather dead plaza (when we went).

It was good to say the least! My boyfriend liked my entree rather than his. He had the very generic - chocolate chip pancakes (which you could get anywhere!) I ordered the B.Y.O. (build your own) skillet. With the build your own, it comes with potatoes which are like little hash brown and a choice of 4 items (choice of 1 cheese, 2 veggies, 1 meat). I opted for spinach and mushroom, pepper jack cheese, and sausage! It was delicious! I personally love eating potatoes and hash browns of the sort with ketchup and tabasco sauce. I was rather surprised because my boyfriend doesn't usually like that kind of stuff so it was great that he wanted mine instead of his own. 

The menu is pretty eclectic, they had hawaiian-ish/filipino food too, but they specialize in breakfast foods of course!

Its a decent drive into the town of Summerlin where my best friend had resided for awhile, but definitely a place to check out if you have some time to spare and want to grab a hearty breakfast before you hit the road!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I went here when I was visiting family. We all got different dishes with different flavors of pancakes. Red velvet, bananas foster (what?!?), straight buttermilk...INSANE. We loved them all, but the bananas foster were by far the most original. I ordered the Kailua pork Eggs Benedict, and what a fun, unique twist on an old favorite! I often judge a breakfast joint on their Benedict. These were lovely. I will be taking my husband the next time we visit my parents."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!! Small but great breakfast place I got the red velvet pancakes with homemade cream cheese spread , it's to die for!! Service is fast , atmosphere great and it's homey and comfortable with great food , this is my second spot to stop for breakfast besides the cracked egg. Give it a go and you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"OMG this is one of the best breakfast places of all time! Yes there is a wait but the food is worth it! The portions are generous and super delicious  I have not had a bad experience here since I have been going, I want to keep it a secret but it's just so good I can't help but share"}
{"text":"First off, it's gotta be 40 degrees in here. I feel like I'm in a refrigerator. My girl mentioned how cold it was to the waitress but being a robot she barely acknowledged we were at the table much less what my girl had said. Weird vibe aside, for the price this was average food. Almost remarkably average actually. The pancakes were ordinary and the eggs were very well done almost plastic like (you know the type). Bacon was also burned. The wait was short for the food but once the food came the experience was further \"enhanced\" by the sound of the woman behind the counter throwing what must have been every piece of silverware they had into a bin. Tranquil.  She looked so pleased too while doing this (smell that, that's sarcasm). Waitress came back once to bring the check and finally ask if we needed anything, had to track down someone else before that for a coffee refill. Wanted to like the place, close to where we live, my girl thought the name was cute, just didn't live up to expectations much less the average corner diner experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Slight wait. Came here with 3 other people. The food was nice and hearty. Well done food with no frills."}
{"text":"Ricks Adobo Fried Rice, is my First Husbands favorite.  I'm still exploring the menu! Loved spam sliders, adore the red velvet Baby Stacks pancakes! 

Service is sometimes an issue! Something very captivating going on in the kitchen this morning for example.... Almost had to refil my own coffee!"}
{"text":"Had Great expectations but that soon changed after the greeting from the hostess and our waitress. Bad experience overall. No, I will not be returning to Baby Cakes. Plenty of restaurants in \"the neighborhood\" who know the value of a customer."}
{"text":"They might have good food but I'll never know. We were meeting friends there this morning and we were running 15 min late thanks to my toddler. We got there and the hostess told us that we cannot join our friends that were already seated even though there was plenty of room on the table. We were told that we had to wait in the 10+ line to be seated. I'm really sorry but this is not how you treat a potential customer. I'm a brunch kinda girl and I'm always on the lookout for a new place to try but Babystacks is being blacklisted. I will never step foot in this establishment. The cracked egg is only a few minutes away and their food and service is always amazing"}
{"text":"Awful pancakes! 
I love pancakes and these were nearly inedible.  The first batch came out undercooked and had to send back 
Second batch was just gross. 
Will never go back again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and always enjoy. They get busy but the wait is worth it. I've always had great service. The pancakes are amazing. You really can't go wrong there. It has an island themed taste so there's spam and rice. Just wish it was a bigger location."}
{"text":"Huge portions and red velvet pancakes were moist and awesome. I'm glad I came here for a nice hearty breakfast. Its off the strip about 15-20 mins at least. But worth it as you get tired of buffets."}
{"text":"Always looking for a new place, and this one had some good reviews. We came here for breakfast last weekend. The menu looked awesome, tons of options, affordable prices. I was quite disappointed, however. As a girl who loves her breakfast meat, I decided to give the corned beef hash a shot. It came with 2 eggs, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. The atmosphere was comfortable, service was quick, and the food was out pretty fast. But when I got my plate, the corned beef hash looked more like a flattened out, dry piece of scrapple (PA Dutchies will know what I mean, or someone from the northeast:) AND. It didn't taste much better. Plus, the whole breakfast was cold. Well, luke warm, I guess, but not as hot as it should have been (cold eggs are gross).  The pancakes looked promising.  I went with the Cinnamon Bun (it was a compromise because I was sharing). But they were dry, and not hot either. And waay too sweet for my taste. I should have gone with my instinct and tried the bacon or carrot cake.  I was not disappointed to the point of not going back. I understand off days, and I don't get all in a huff about stuff ( watching people flip out in a restaurant makes me feel embarrassed for them). It was still good service, and had good conversation with surrounding tables. I may have just been unlucky that morning."}
{"text":"We came here at about 1130 on a Monday morning and there was a short wait. The menu was extensive and it was difficult to decide what to eat because it all looked so good! My friend and I both went with skillet meals. It was great! The place was reasonably priced and the coffee and OJ were A-OK. The staff was attentive. I would recommend."}
{"text":"My egg omelette was good with my side buttermilk pancakes. On the other hand, my other half says not to order the ham and eggs with rice. The ham is like sandwich ham and only one scoop of rice. Pancakes were a little under cooked. The worst part of the experience was the service. Everyone has bad days but I think our waiter couldn't keep up with coming back to check on taking our order, bringing us coffee refills, cleaning up a drink spill, bringing back a to go box and bringing our bill. We had to find another server to help us. Guess we have to find a new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"3 words: RED VELET PANCAKES!!!!  Flipping awesome, they have this great little crust texture and are dusted with chocolate.  I know it sounds super rich but that's the great thing it's not.  Just the perfect amount.  The Mexican is great too with carnitas is great but lately they have been a little scimpy on the amount in the omlete. I hope that changes or I'll have to adjust my rating."}
{"text":"Pancakes are so good and there is a wide variety.  My favorite is the Banana Fosters and Tito Ricks Adobo Fried Rice.  The only reason why I give it a 4 is because its a hit or miss with the service.  The best time to go is during brunch Monday-Friday and not a holiday."}
{"text":"Probably will never eat here again. This place wasn't somewhere to rant about or even think about going back. Service was ok, but I want the food good also."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here due to the really good reviews but I honestly just had an average experience. We got lucky and didn't have to wait in line to be seated so that was a plus. We ordered the chicken adobo fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. The fried rice was not as good as I was expecting. The rice was kind of hard and it just tasted like vinegar. The \"adobo\" flavor that I was looking for was close to non-existent. It came with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were extremely dry. At least the serving size was enough for at least two people. I also tried their red velvet pancakes. I thought it was okay as it was missing that kick of red velvet (if you had your eyes closed while eating, you'd probably think it was just a regular pancake.\" I understand that the restaurant is not that spacious but the tables are way too close to each other. I definitely came to this place with a really high expectation and I just let myself down. At least our server was pretty attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Delish!  Happy it's opened early for early breakfast risers ;). Had their go to adobo omelette and red velvet pancakes! Hands down a must if it's your first time.  Portion was good enough that it became my lunch too (leftovers).

Coming from SD chee hoooo for this breakfast spot! Will come again :)"}
{"text":"It was such a cute little place.. Very homey and the food was delicious.. Definitely will come back to try other food on the menu.. The red velvet pancake was awesomeeeee.. But maybe im biased because i love red velvet.. Definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"Food there is always delicious  BUT I went with my sisters and one ordered carrot cake pancakes. They came out burnt so she sent them back and a girl came back WITH THE OLD ONES and says \"see they are meant to be this color\" to try and prove my sister (the customer!) Wrong. My sister even explained it's not the color, it's the taste. I don't know if I will return after that stupidity."}
{"text":"I love the red velvet pancakes with turkey bacon! I've also tried the seasonal pumpkin pancakes, which was really yummy!"}
{"text":"I tried the bay chick skillet.  Absolutely delicious!!! My friends had the s'mores pancakes and banana cream pi pancakes.  Everything was delicious and price was great.  Nothing expensive.  So when you lose money in the casinos, you can still eat."}
{"text":"I went here to eat on two occasions, with the last being this morning.  Today, I waited half an hour to be seated as it was quite busy, which was a great sign.  Once seated, we waited about 25 minutes for our waiter to come to our table to take our orders.  Once he took our orders, it took an hour for our food to come.  Now, the previous time we came, it took a while for our food to come, but not that long.  Once thing I noticed was that the servers (three of them) were all busy doing something, but it wasn't serving folks.  It almost seemed as if the kitchen was at a stand-still, and food would just creep out one order every 10 to 15 minutes.  Once the food did come, the portions seemed small for the price we paid.  Now, this is comparing the food to the other well known \"local\" breakfast chain we frequent.  The food wasn't terrible in quality, it just took FOREVER to come out, and was overpriced.  I can't recommend them at all."}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was a winner!  No wait time on a Sunday, though the waiting area was full.  We were a party of two, so we lucked out on an open table.  My omelet came out incorrectly, but the waiter was helpful in fixing the situation.  I upgraded to the Red Velvet pancakes.  I'm a huge fan of Red Velvet cupcakes, so I had to give it a shot.  It was so yummy, moist, and just all around delicious!  I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food but the overall service could be better. On three separate occasions our order has been wrong, usually having to do with the potatoes (we order hashbrowns but will get seasoned potatoes, not a huge deal to me). Also, when I order \"over medium eggs\" I expect the whites to be cooked and not runny which they are always runny here so I just order scrambled. Other than that I love their selection of food!"}
{"text":"The food and the waiter were excelent!!! But there was a waitress  named Monica who was so rude and careless of customer service.
When  my relatives were arriving a little late and they tried to explain her that they had already a reservation and also if we can add another chair or to find any solution to be all my family together. She didn't find any solution and said no I can't.
So sad because it was an uncomfortable breakfast because we had to divide  our family in two different tables. 
Definitely we are not coming back anymore to this place unless the customer service improve."}
{"text":"OH, BABY... STACKS! This is definitely the place for an absolutely delicious, big portioned, Hawaiian style breakfast! The menu is quite extensive and has various options, all full of so much flavor and epitomizes the idea of breakfast soul food! They're open 7 days a week, but only from 7:00am till 2:00pm, meaning wait times can vary -- I once was told there was a 30 minute wait, once immediately... it's just the luck of the draw. But easily it's worth the wait!

FOR HER: 
- I ordered my usual, a full stack (6) of WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES. Infused with so much goodness and topped with powdered sugar and more white chocolate chips. (I also love their RED VELVET PANCAKES w/ cream cheese syrup too!)

FOR HIM:
- If I don't order this, he will: LOLO RICK'S ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE. A tradiational filipino dish of marinated shredded chicken & rice wrapped in an egg omelette, garnished with green onions. Comes with a side of homemade macaroni or seasoned potatoes (these are so good!) -- or you can upgrade to your choice of pancakes!"}
{"text":"A really good place for early morning breakfast. We got there around 7:30am craving breakfast food. 

HIS & HERs: We had random cravings so we ordered a few things to share. We ordered the WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES, the ADOBO FRIED RICE OMLETTE, & the CHICKEN SKILLET w/ a side of CINNABON PANCAKES. We're fat, I know.

Everything was extremely good... My only qualm was that there weren't really white chocolate chips infused into the pancakes. Previously we ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were perfectly infused and I still highly recommend! The adobo fried rice was also really rich and satisfying. Wasn't too fond of the skillet personally... not as flavorful, but wasn't bad. And if you're into it, they also have sugar free syrup, which we were really happy about! Overall, definitely will return when we have an early morning sweet tooth! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great value. This place is so good!!!! Even the kids liked the eggs. The Banana Foster pancakes are so good, I dream of them daily!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and Creative!  Service was fast and good. Only complaint was the lack of seating as we had a 40 min wait but it was a busy weekend."}
{"text":"Adobo omelet is not really good. I cant taste the adobo which supposed to be vinegar and soy sauce with garlicky taste. It seems its from freezer.

 Best thing is the red velvet pancake."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever had pancakes are the best out here in vegas sooo worth 30 min wait. can't wait to go  back."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype about this place but I found it crowded, noisy and the decor was dull. I ordered a standard breakfast of eggs, bacon, potatoes and of course pancakes. Unfortunately, they were completely average. There's nothing special about this place and it's certainly not worth waiting more than 10 minutes to be seated. 

You can get this kind of food any where and probably for less money."}
{"text":"Came here cuz we were working in the area and had a few hours to kill for breakfast. I also read the good reviews on Yelp. Being my first visit, the service was good and food was amazing. I had the Adobo Fried Rice with sliced avocado. my buddies had different meals and all were satisfied. Baby cakes is not your typical cafe. Will come again next time I'm working in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you love authentic food whether it be stacks of amazing pancakes in flavors you've never thought of to a Hawaiian Eggs Benedict, then this restaurant is the place for you. I make sure that I do not leave Las Vegas without going there at least once. Sometimes, when I see some of their specials-I'm tempted to hop on a plane just to go eat there! I will say this though: it's ALWAYS BUSY. Be prepared to wait a bit if it's a last minute decision to eat there. Planning ahead is recommended BIG TIME. Great customer service, outstanding food and in one of my favorite places! It's PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Super duper blah. Most of the wait staff move and act like robots. Unfortunately our waiter made some bad decisions and we ended up spending over an hour there. The food seems like it is completely fabricated from the Sysco truck. Pancakes were dryer than the base of mount charleston. They did offer a military discount. That brought them from 1 star to two."}
{"text":"The people were friendly the food was ok. I did not like the bisquits and gravy. So she did not charge me,even though my husband ate them."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes are genius! I should feel guilty eating dessert for breakfast. Nope. Cream cheese icing tops off fluffy red velvet pancakes. 

Friendly and efficient staff. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"LATE REVIEW: I had came here to meet up with my cousin before I hit the road back to Cali back on the last week of November 2015. 

The restaurant itself is small. Parking wasn't bad. The wait is bad. It's not a great place to come to if all your friends are planing to meet up here. They don't sit you down unless your whole party is there. 

The food was spectacular though and our server was very friendly and accommodating. And the wait for our food wasn't that long. 

I ordered the Baby Chick Omlette and Cinnubun Pancakes

I highly recommend coming here especially if you're from out of town. It's a nice, relaxed ambiance."}
{"text":"OMG.. LOVE THIS PLACE... I know everyone rave about the red velvet pancake (which was not bad) but the SMORE pancake... it was SO GOOD~  the marshmallows and chocolate chips were mixed into the batter and you could definitely taste it.  And of course they topped the pancakes off with MORE marshmallows and chocolate chips + whipped cream...  I didn't even have to add the syrup they gave me and it was tasty enough.

Besides from the pancake, we got the kalua pork benedict.  That was also really good with the combination of cabbage."}
{"text":"We've tried to eat at BabyStacks several times, but the line was always too long. Today was my husband's birthday, so we decided we'd go no matter how long the wait. We got there a little after 8, and luckily there was no line at all! (Not the case when we left, though. I guess if you come after 9, you're out of luck.)

I had the adobo fried rice omelet with a side of red velvet pancakes. The birthday boy had the country eggs benedict with hash browns. All were excellent -- even better than anticipated! My omelet was chockful of chicken and rice, and the marinade made the chicken taste almost like pork. (It reminded me of my grandma's pork-fried rice, and that's a good thing!) The only bad thing I can say is that I loved the adobo so much that I can't imagine ordering anything else. (Maybe a different side dish, although the red velvet pancakes were delicious.)

This place is tiny, which is part of the reason why there's usually a line out front. But the main reason for the wait is that the food is just that good. Maybe next time we'll come with  friends so we can try some of the other dishes on the menu. It's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We went today for the first time, it is clean, friendly, and the food is delish!  Our waitress was fantastic, and we will for sure be back! I suggest you go, be prepared for a wait if it is on the weekend, because it was packed at 11 am on a Thursday!  Yum Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Visiting North Las Vegas to see the fam and they suggested to have the Adobo Fried Rice.

Got there just in time without any wait.  The staff is super friendly and very helpful.  I shared an order of the Adobo Fried Rice and side order of the Red Velvet Pancake with my cousin's girlfriend.  We didn't wait long for our order to arrive.

Everything was onolicious, it was much better than expected and I am glad we shared because I wouldn't have the room to eat the deelish Red Velvet Pancake. It was so fluffy and cooked thoroughly."}
{"text":"We love coming to baby stacks it's our favorite breakfast spot and the food is amazing the food gets 5 stars and service is usually pretty great as well I give Valerie 5 stars. Unfortunately this time my service was awful!!!! 
We got there at around 10:30 we were seated promptly after and greeted by a guy who took our drink order coffee, raspberry tea, a water, and a kids apple juice as we watched him walking back and forth and still no drinks we assumed he had forgotten then he stops again still no drinks and takes our food order and tells us he'll be back with our drinks \"ok \" 10 more minutes pass by and finally we get our drinks, roughly we waited for drinks about 20-25 minutes which is completely ridiculous! Now we get our food about 5 minutes after finally receiving our drinks and my friend who ordered toast with her omelet asks for jelly he says ok and that he'll be right back with that did he ever come back with jelly??? You guessed it nope no jelly from him I stood up myself and grabbed jelly off the breakfast bar.  now our food is almost gone our plates are piled up he never came back to refill our drinks or ask us how we were doing. Finally my friend gets up to ask the hostess to speak to the manager and guess who shows up at our table you guessed it Erik our server who is also \"the manager\" we let him know everything that went wrong and before he ever apologized his excuse was that he was busy mind you the restaurant is small and probably has a capacity of  maybe 100 ppl coming from the industry and management 101 your busy is never ever an excuse! You alway always first and foremost sincerely apologize to your guest! Ps to the general manger of this restaurant \"Clariza\" please be aware of who you leave in charge of your restaurant and get him more training ASAP 
It says a lot that the worst service We have ever received came from the manager of your restaurant!!! 
Don't ask for Erik aka the manager he is the guy with the colored mushroom on top of his head. 
Do ask for Valerie she is awesome!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! It seemed to take a while to come out even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. I would return for the lemon ricotta pancakes and Portuguese sausage!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were delicious and their whipped cream was phenomenal. I would go back because the place was nice and clean and immediately smelled fresh and clean you walked in. 

I ordered an omelette which kinda had a funky taste as if the cooking oil was poor quality or something. 

From my husband: While the Red velvet pancakes are a novel idea, the Juevos rancheros cannot be eaten without a fork and a knife (it would be nicer to have the tortillas on the side). The hash browns could be more crispy.  Five stars for presentation and service ."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here this morning and the food was exceptional, great customer service, decent prices and very clean environment. We definitely plan on coming back here for breakfast. Also, come early! They get really busy."}
{"text":"BabyStacks is a great local breakfast place that everyone can enjoy. I have come here a few times before and my go to is the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. These pancakes are a little thinner than the regular pancakes. The pancakes are flavored with a hint of lemon, making them slightly sour. The pancakes are dusted with confectioners' sugar and has a sweet and tangy lemon syrup that you drizzle all over the pancakes. This syrup is surprisingly sweet and just slightly tart. The contrast of sweet and tartness gives the pancake and the sauce a wonderful flavor that meshes well together. I highly recommend trying this dish!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Pancakes tasted like dessert. Their spam scramble was pretty good too. Great service. Not a lot of seating but we were seated quickly"}
{"text":"I went to brunch with a few friends last week. It came highly recommended by 2 of them, so I decided to make the out of the way drive to check it out. The wait was quoted to us at 20 min, but we waited closer to 45 min. The staff was very friendly though, and its not a very big place so you could clearly see people just hanging out at their table after eating. After the long wait I wanted to order everything on the menu!! Which was pretty decent size, a lot to choose from. Of course the red velvet pancakes were a must try, but I'm more of a bacon and eggs kinda person. I got the Piglet omelet (bacon, sausage, ham, and cheddar cheese) and red velvet pancakes, they charge a little more to get specialty pancakes but that's normal. The omelet was decent (not the best Ive ever had) but the pancakes were to die for. They serve pretty big portions though, so the pancakes are more like a breakfast desert. Which worked out well because i could only down a couple more bites of food at that point. All in all it was good, i would recommend it to friends, don't think ill be making the long drive to eat their too often though."}
{"text":"My mom really wanted to try this place out so I tagged along with her. Right away we where seated in the back area it seemed busy but not too hectic. Our server took our order, the food came pretty fast and was great! Unfortunately our server did not check up on us at all ( we had no condiments or napkins I had to get up and grab them myself on the shelf by their kitchen) he didn't come by to ask if we needed a refill or anything also this couple next to us you can tell they needed refill because the guy was just sucking his drink with only ice in it lol... overall the food might bring us back but the service from that server could improve!"}
{"text":"Reason for my rating. Everyone in our party that ordered eggs. Were cooked wrong. Over medium was cooked over hard for mine. The taste of the pancakes was not good. Them adding toppings to the pancakes will make them taste a little better. I would not wast my money again. 
Employees were eating and drinking while working. Yuk!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious breakfast. They have a verity of dishes but all taste home made.  Their prices are great too"}
{"text":"Tried this location this morning. And have to say, for a new location and a new business in the sw, the customer service from walking in to leaving left a lot to be desired. The server was ok, the host was just absolutely clueless to what and how to do his job. Answered the phone with \"hello\" not with the business name, sat people way out of order and was just rude. We waited 30 minutes for a table when others came in and got sat in 5. I actually said something and ended up getting the next table. 

Our order was a little off but the gentleman that brought it out right was the absolute nicest of the group of people we interacted with. Very small dining area left us feeling super cramped. People would walk by and run into our chairs and table. 

I believe this was all started off with the host guy and his lack of personality and experience in his job. The food was ok, the experience made it bad though."}
{"text":"Plugs are on the ceiling so if u need 2 charge ur phone- bring an extension cord :)

Portuguese sausage and eggs is ok.  Garlic rice is yummo.

Buttermilk pancake is ok.

Blackened chix sandwich had good texture.

Gave it a 5 star prematurely.  3.5 star is more appropriate for the food.    

Excellent service :)"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. I get the kalbi ribs wife loves the banana fosters and the cookie butter French toast. You might be waiting for lil bit but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing staff great service! Just moved to Vegas and its my favorite breakfast spot! 
Banana foster pancakes are amazingggggg!!!!! 
Everything is good here!!!! Reminds me of the pancakes in Maui! 
5 stars + 1 :) 

Also don't be cheap to ur waitresses! I've seen a lot of cheap tippers when going In there to eat! If u can't tip for the great service stay the hell home or go get mcdonalds!"}
{"text":"Great costumer service, food and pancake are delicious!! Place is very clean they offer military discount!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe we ordered wrong but we didn't find the food to be anything special.  We had a Mexican Skillet and Blueberry Pancakes with a side of ham.  The skillet was okay but didn't live up to my boyfriend's other favorites (i.e. The Griddle).  My blueberry pancakes were okay but small for the price and a little overcooked.  The ham was fine but dry.

There was one delicious highlight to the meal...the Cinnamon Role or Cinnabun Pancakes with the skillet.  Both of us loved these and will probably order them if we end up back on this side of town for breakfast.

Service was great!  Melanie (?) brought water with the coffee and juice even when I forgot to ask and was prompt about taking our order even though they were busy.  The food came out quick and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious place for brunch! It's usually packed with limited seating inside so be prepared to wait. It's worth the wait once you get your plate!

Portions are large and I made the mistake of ordering a FULL stack of pancakes my first time here. A half already has 3 and is more than enough especially if you're eating other stuff like breakfast skillets, which are bomb by the way. Their pancakes are so good and there's so many to choose from! Very fluffy and sweet; definitely satisfied my sweet tooth and kept me full for most of the day. 

They have savory entrees as well, such as Adobo Fried Rice, Kailua Pig Benedict, Loco Mocos, Skillets, County Fried Steak and Burritos. Feels like I'm in Hawaii or the Philippines. Love the vibes and food here!"}
{"text":"Since I am on a roll in catching up on reviews, I will go back and review the pictures I posted back in April 2014.  Just like my review on \"Jamms Restaurant\", this place is locally ran and well visited by locals!  They are well known for their red velvet pancakes and of course their waiting time.  Unlike Jamms, they have \"3 locations\" you can visit and if you are out of towners, they have a closer location.

Now I can't recall what my other half order but I can for sure tell you what I ordered...because of the pictures, duh!!!  LOL.  The red velvet pancakes were moist and literally melts in your mouth once you engulf it into your mouth.  The bacon was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Hash browns where soft and fluffy to eat and of course they fixed my eggs just the way I like them!

Besides the long wait, it is definitely a place to repeat!"}
{"text":"The hostess was extremely rude.  Acted as if we were an inconvenience for showing up.   We had to greet her to even get an acknowledgment that we were standing in front of her.. No pleasantries, just a short annoyed huff and puff followed by \"how many, 10 mins\"

Food was good."}
{"text":"Great food... Orange pancakes were yum yum! Our waitress Kaylah was awesome. Overall very pleased with our breakfast and will be going back to try other flavors of pancakes."}
{"text":"Attention all passengers please bring your seat to the upright postion and fasten your seatbelts.

..What! What? Are we landing already?

Having my headset on and blaring AC/DC all I was dreaming about was Babystacks Cafe and those Red Velvet Pancakes!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ?select=iBVAE_AKie8MbW7D7PyvwA#M9rG8nMTXfqbL79IX4tFqA

...What? Fasten my What? 

Ooooo. *Drooling*..Red  Velvet Pancakes pictures and reviews I read about from LV Hawaii born Nelson Q. and other Yeeps.

I'm a total believer in BSC , after my first bite into the Red Velvet Pancake I was in love. This truly must be a cake in disguise! (That good). 

I was not disappointed with my choice to make this my first stop after landing and my 1st bookmarked place to try.
 
What a great way to start the day in Las Vegas!

Service was Awesome and Attentive.

Located in Flamingo Village Plaza, Babystacks Cafe has ample parking and was easy to find.

Yelpers bookmark this place!

{"text":"I only put one start because I was going to invite me my mom but as soon as I walked in someone rudely said we are closed ! So in my head I'm like ohh well shouldn't you have locked the doors for I wouldn't have wasted my time going inside . Plus it was 2:05 I don't think u should say no to a costumer right away"}
{"text":"My favorite thing besides the food is the service
Top notch they make you feel like family the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Yummy.  I don't think one could order badly.  The food is just that good.  Small space.  Long wait, so be prepared if you come during the peak times of break and lunch. Generous portions.  Don't be shy: think out of the box.
Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"So I ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice Omelette for take out. The customer service was great when I went to get the food, but the rice and chicken in my omelette was on the salty side. Not sure that I want to order that again or maybe I should tell them to cool it on the soy sauce. The rice was saturated in soy sauce. I'll give them another shot, but hope they don't make me another salty dish."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite breakfast spot in Las Vegas! In would come early when they open otherwise you will have to wait in line for 30+ minutes at. This resturant specializes in pancakes but has a variety of Portuguese/Hawaiian influenced breakfast and lunch options. Open for breakfast and lunch only."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast. My husband had the country fried steak with garlic rice. He loved it !! My choice was egg white garden omelet. It arrived wayyyy too greasy but our lovely waitress named Felicia was very receptive to taking it back and having the kitchen make a new one. The second time it was perfect. If you're looking for a less greasy omelet make sure you order it dry."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food. Was so excited to get a breakfast place in our neighborhood and was happy this place had more seating than the other location. We typically do our family breakfast thing on the weekend which is always packed so we started doing our orders to go. Worked great until they stopped taking takeout orders until after 12pm! Completely ridiculous that a restaurant which is only breakfast fare would limit their hours like that. I have small kids so it is difficult to take them to crowded places and wait 30 minutes for food. Guess we will just have to take our business to Mimi's Cafe who hires enough staff to handle their rush periods."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to going to BabyStacks for 6 months.  Finally made the trek today - disappointed in the red velvet and hazelnut pancakes - very dry.  I did tell our server as I had to ask for more syrup.  I ordered a large order of hazelnut and left 4 pancakes - just couldn't even think about taking them home.  My husband ordered the adobe fried rice and didn't enjoy the flavor and the mac salad was bland.  At any rate, previous reviews pointed out that the banana cream pie pancakes are good, and they were.  Their coffee was great and our server checked on us several times.  We went about 8:45 am today, a Sunday, and had to wait about 40 minutes.  We didn't mind - they have sitting space for the wait."}
{"text":"We ordered half their menu lol 

We ordered:
Spam Scramble: spam make everything taste better
Kahlua Pig Benedict: I'm not a fan of kahlua pig but when they turned it into a Benedict, it was to die for!
Loco Moco: I live in SD and cannot find good loco moco, this was definitely something to have to come back for again.
Marble Crunch Pancakes: indescribable, just pray when you visit, they still have it because it's a seasonal item. 
Red Velvet Pancakes: is their speciality! Just imagine a cupcake transformed into something better. 

I have nothing bad to say about this place, even the service was awesome. My coffee cup was never empty. I feel bad I don't remember her name. She had the best smile!"}
{"text":"Must try. Their menu has too many good options. I settled on the ranchero skillet and Cinnabun pancakes. I think the only negative thing I can say is that I wish there were more chicken in the skillet. The skillet was enormous and the pancakes were a decent size so I got lunch and dinner for ~$14 after tip. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Sind zufällig auf das Café gestoßen. Wir haben etwas gesucht, wo wir frühstücken können, nachdem wir in Las Vegas abgereist waren. Sind also zufällig darauf gestoßen. Es war einfach fantastisch!! Mitunter das beste Frühstück, das wir auf unserer Reise hatten. Der Service war auch sehr gut. Die Bedienung hat uns alles geduldig erklärt, uns gute Empfehlungen gegeben und sogar Extrawünsche erfüllt. Und das Essen selbst: einfach lecker!! Besonders empfehlenswert ist das homemade corned beef!"}
{"text":"Wow! Those banana foster pancakes are a must!!!!! My dad, brother and I all ordered different things (cinnabun pancakes, chili loco moco and the banana foster pancakes). We all agreed the banana was the best and they couldn't stop from reaching into my plate ;) we tried to come on a Sunday once, but the wait was over 1hr. On today's Monday morning we walked right in. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot with Hawaiian style breakfast. Wish I can try everything on the menu they all looked so good! I got some garlic fried rice with scrambled eggs and the red velvet short stack pancakes. The pancakes are so good! But a little too cakey for me, it was very filling. Service was also good. It can get packed here on the weekends so be prepared to wait awhile especially if you have a big party."}
{"text":"If you have a car in Vegas and wanna drive off the strip for some local food, then here you go. 

Been wanting to try this spot since I've heard good things about it but never had the opportunity until yesterday.

Wasn't hard to find, but just pretty off the strip. Can't miss the signage outside tho. Totally feeling their logo.

For a Friday, there was a lunch rush especially since it closes early. Wait wasn't too bad, took about 10mins which gave us time to check out their menu.

Everyone's been raving about their red velvet pancakes so we got that. Not bad, wasn't as red as I was expecting, a bit dry but the cream cheese frosting/syrup saved it. Someone in our party got the chocolate chip pancakes but they were underwhelming --nothing special. 

For my main meal, I got their version of the loco moco. Maybe it was my fault for getting it with egg whites but something just wasn't right about it. I did like the fact that I had the option of getting it with garlic fried rice tho. Probably won't get it again. 

For so far off the strip, not sure if I'd come back unless I was with people that are dying to check it out."}
{"text":"I have been here a coupe times and its delicious every time! I had bananas foster short stack and damn! It's amazing! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is very good? Huge variety, don't know how they do it, 2 cups of coffee to make a decisions. 
Service provided by Christopher was TOP NOTCH!  Thank you
I hate to give this review, cause I don't want it crowded, but we have to keep this place!

Second visit as good as the first, sausage was fresh cooked eggs perfect , once again Christopher provided great friendly service"}
{"text":"Wanted a non-chain breakfast place and this was a fabulous find. Prices are acceptable, especially for the quality. The menu is extensive with lots of quirky originals as well the breakfast standards. Had corned beef hash that was fabulous!! My toddlers kids meal was huge so I also got to graze from hers :) Service was great and the music playing was so happy-go-lucky I couldn't help but smile."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for breakfast. The atmosphere is kid friendly. Food is fresh and there is a ton of choices for pancakes and crepes. The only two gripes I have is the price, and when you order the crepes or pancakes they don't come with eggs or hash browns, so you will end up paying more for sides. The service is friendly. All and all a good place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town. Good service. Pancake heaven for people who loves pancake. Island breakfast option too."}
{"text":"Jacob was fantastic!  Maybe I should've ordered the pancakes or pancakes, I mean they are called baby cakes.  I'm not familiar w/ this area & was starving for eggs so got the sausage & eggs platter w/ seasoned potatoes & toast.  

I totally give service 5 stars, but the meal was no good.  The turkey sausage tasted like a TV dinner & the scrambled eggs were not seasoned.  They were just ok.  The seasoned potatoes were fantastic w/ Cholula on them.  I would honestly be back to try a sweeter dish cause the ladies next to me had a sweet & beautiful dish.   I am not a sweet entree person that early in the morning, however will not order a regular breakfast next time."}
{"text":"I was looking for IHOP, but feeling a Hawaiian mood. Went Aloha Kitchen, but they're closed still. This place is the combination of both places and has the Aloha spirt in the foods. I looked at the menu and said YES ! Everything I want if I woke up in Oahu!  Come one , come all ! You can have it all !"}
{"text":"Always love coming here whenever I'm in Vegas! Their pancakes are so delicious as well as their main dishes. The adobo omelette is a popular dish that hits home if you've been deprived from Filipino food. I decided to get the kalbi ribs which did not disappoint! Also got a stack of cookies and cream pancakes which were the most delicious pancakes ever! It wasn't overly sweet at all. There's multiple locations around LV, but they're all great!"}
{"text":"Ventured off the strip and it paid off. I had the red velvet pancakes. Delish! Spam scramble with garlic rice. Yum! Great breakfast with the family and reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"On a road trip and spotted this place for breakfast.   We almost missed it but I am glad we didn't. The place was clean and the service was prompt and very friendly. Good coffee. Great food.

What a perfect start to the day."}
{"text":"Love this place although it's a little experience it's a great place to have brunch and breakfast! Service there is okay but the food it worth it. Red velvet there is a favorite"}
{"text":"We waited 1hr for our food. It was packed when we went. We also were behind parties of 6 and 7. The food was really good and we were not in a hurry. For us it was worth the wait. One thing I don't like is the Orange juice was small and no refills for $2.59."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about baby stacks.  one opened on my end of town so decided to give it a go.  

sat quickly and waited a good 10 minutes for water and coffee/tea order.  another 10 to get the drinks.

food took a whI would like to say the food sat under the heat lamp way too long and was overly dry when it was delivered.  not the case.  it sat somewhere for too long and was delivered cold.

our waitress was great and took everything back and removed the meals from our check.  the kick in the pants is that I still received a bill for one cup of coffee.  kinda bush league..."}
{"text":"This place is delish! Every time we have family or friends visiting vegas we take them here on Sundays. Red velvet pancakes are amazing! I only gave three stars because compared to the other babystacks their Adobo fried rice omelet is on the salty side, too much to bare. You need to drink a ton of water or eat more rice to balance all the salt intake. I thought it was only one day but been there several times and still so salty. Wish they took reservations or possibly putting our name on the waiting list as we drive there. Oh well. Guess that's how they make their money. I still drive to the original babystacks to get there adobo fried rice omelet. Just waiting for the Henderson location to get it right. Otherwise everything else is yummy!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch to celebrate a birthday. The omelets were very good and the potatoes were not too greasy. 
Love the reggae theme music and the server was friendly.
This is a great informal  place to meet friends and have a meal."}
{"text":"Amazing! I don't know if words can do this place justice! You must go and try it. Great food, great service,great prices, and great atmosphere. The staff are so friendly and fast, we walked in and were seated immediately but wouldn't mind waiting if it were a busy day. Our waitress came right over got our drinks within seconds and once we ordered our food we waited under five minutes for our food and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Service was nice, food was ok.  Had lemon ricotta pancakes, chili omelette, hash browns, and pb & banana babystacks (2 small pancakes).  Lemon ricotta was good but nothing special to rave about. Omelette was smaller than we imagined, probably due to the close up pictures here on yelp.  Eggs were super fluffy but flavor was bland.  Pb pancake was dense and flavorful - even though it was small it was very filling.  Hash browns were typical, small in size.  Oh, also had coffee and grapefruit juice - I wouldn't order the grapefruit juice again.  It seemed water down.  Service was nice and so was ambiance.

I hear the line gets ridiculous so I consider us lucky for not having to wait in line to sit (went around 11 am on a Sunday).  Having eaten there now, I don't think it's worth a wait.  I would come back to try the red velvet everyone keeps raving about but otherwise I'd rather go to OPH or Hash Hash."}
{"text":"My sons and I had an awesome breakfast here this morning.  This is the only restaurant where I know the corned beef is perfect and delicious.  Add the garlic rice and some scrambled eggs and BAM!  The Loco Moco was a hit with the big kid and adding garlic rice sent it over the top.  I missed a photo of the Lemon Ricotta pancakes with cream cheese glaze....OMGoodness they were light and lemony and delicious.  
Our server was Edgar (I hope I got that right) and he was awesome as well.  Thank you for a perfect start to our day.  We will be back as soon as we can."}
{"text":"The bananas foster pancakes were awesome! My only issue was it is 45° outside and we sat near the back door and it was open. I told them it's cold and all I got was a sorry. Door remained open. Edgar was my server and he was nice and attentive to everything except the artic blast. This won't stop me from returning the food is always good."}
{"text":"I tried the red velvet pancakes, and I'm not a pancake lover.... but oh my goodness it was so delicious! The whip cream almost has an ice cream flavor too me so worth it though. Oh the cream cheese syrup, again personally don't like cream cheese, but this syrup was yummy lol. The service once seated is prompt. I have no idea which one I'll pick on my next trip."}
{"text":"Second time eating at Baby Stacks Cafe & I must say I loved it. There was a wait time to get seated, but that's at any good place you go to. Once we were seated we were greeted by Danielle and she took our drink orders right away. She was super sweet, always had a smile on her face, and made us all feel so comfortable. She answered a few questions about the menu and didn't get annoyed when I asked her if she had tried the German chocolate pancakes before and if so, would she recommend them? She said they were yummy although she doesn't like chocolate cake herself (I'm the same way lol)... She was attentive the whole time. Refilled the drinks when needed to and asked us if there was anything else we needed. Overall, the food was yummy and the service by Danielle was even greater."}
{"text":"I always receive excellent customer service at every Babystacks location I go to. The servers are always attentive, kind, and patient. I feel like this is the perfect place for brunch because there are both breakfast and lunch options on the menu. The food is always consistent in presentation and taste, and it's super delish. My favorite that I always get are the ever so famous red velvet pancakes with the yummy cream cheese syrup to top it off. If you're looking for an awesome breakfast joint with a rather relaxed atmosphere compared to others, I highly recommend this place. It will forever be one of my favorites to go to."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is horrible! This place has no organization. Front cashier girl is horrible and very unprofessional. We were told 45 minute wait and waited almost an hour and a half! No courtesy to walk out and let us know there will be a longer wait nor an apology for such a long wait. Cashier gets her manager and I see her laugh at the fact that we were complaining about the wait. And then she gives my family and I dirty looks. Definitely won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I Love this place but the wait is always so long.  I am longing for the day that they get a bigger space so you can reliably go there(I don't always have time to wait).  Everything is delicious here, especially their Hawaiian dishes and pancakes.  Cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"We drive by Baby Stacks regularly but this morning was the first time we stopped to eat here. OMG! It was the BEST breakfast I've had in quite a while! The menu has a wide variety and there is something for everyone in it. I had the country fried steak and eggs and I upgraded to the garlic fried rice. My other half ordered the corned beef hash and eggs and upgraded his order of buttermilk pancakes to the Banana Foster pancakes. The food was plentiful and soooooooo delicious! Our server Maria provided excellent service and our food came out quickly.  The restaurant is located on the corner of Smoke Ranch and Buffalo right next to Sierra Gold. If you're in the neighborhood, I definitely suggest that you stop here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We won't go back.  
Walked in and were seated almost immediately. Before we even sat in our chairs a server asked us what we want to drink we hadn't even looked at the menu and had no clue what they .  I opted for Diet Coke while my fiancé got Dr Pepper which came out clear.  We ask them to check that apparently the syrup had run out. Took them 10 minutes to get another Dr Pepper to us.  

In the same 10 seconds that we were asked what to drink we were asked if we were ready to order again haven't even looked at the menu.  The waitress was overly attentive it was actually annoying.  We both got omelettes and to be honest for 25 bucks I could've fed 25 people at my house.  And it would've tasted better.  I can only assume it's strictly a pancake place.  

We felt so rushed in there as the crowd started getting bigger waiting to get seated they look at you and watch you eat.  Paying for your meal is a joke took about 15 minutes just to get to the register to pay.  We gave it a try but we won't go back."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch! Loco Moco with the Kahlua pork and garlic rice was so yummy! My son had the regular Loco and said he felt like we were back on Maui! The orange cream? Pancakes were to die for. We all had so much food we couldn't finish, but everything was great! Super great service too!"}
{"text":"I went in with the family always seen this place going to baseball games finally decided to give it a try and o boy have I been missing out. Hands down one of the best spots in town the Cinnabon baby stacks OMG"}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying I love babystacks cafe! Their red velvet pancakes are out of this world!  I was so excited for the centennial location to open, but what a disappointment:-(. I understand being overwhelmed but making people wait for 30-40 minutes on a Sunday at 12, when not even half of the restaurant had people seated was crazy.  At one point there were more employees in there than customers, and they just could not get it together.  There were at least 6 people standing at the food pass window.  And when we witnessed a girl pick food up off the counter (with no gloves on) and put it back on the plate, I really thought I was gonna be sick.  
My advice, if your not staffed, and properly trained, then don't open.  And clearly they were not ready.  I can't promise I will or won't go back. My favorite is the smoke ranch location, so I may just keep driving there, or I will go back to the cracked egg."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my sisters and it was a great experience! We got Nutella crepes, huevos rancheros, and loco moco, everything was so good!!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring the family for breakfast. My kids love the pancakes. The Kalua Pig Benedict taste like kalua pig back in Hawaii. The breakfast burrito was large, cheesy and very filling. The corned beef hash was good. We also had cinnabun pancakes, rocky road pancakes, and smores pancakes. All were yummy.

A variety of pancakes to choose from. 

The prices are very good for the quality and quantity of food. 

The coffee is okay. I prefer 100% Kona coffee, so I'm pretty particular about my coffee. I drink my coffee black, so the taste and strength is good."}
{"text":"Food and service was impeccable pancakes of every flavor imaginable.. lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious.. I had the Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice wrapped up in an omelet. I added the green sauce that they make in house, and Hollandaise sauce was off the hook. I highly recommend adding those two, to kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"Good little -- and I mean little -- breakfast place. This place is tiny! Expect a wait. Pancakes are their specialty, and there is something for everyone. Good experiences, waitstaff is very friendly and prompt. The smallness does detract, like other reviewers have noted. It can be a little loud too. Check it out if you are in the mood for pancakes and have some time to kill."}
{"text":"So I was looking forward to trying this place since it's always busy and I've seen and heard many friends eat here. We were terribly disappointed. When we first arrived and went on the waiting list we noticed that there were several seats available at the counter and several tables outside that weren't being used even though there were plenty of people waiting. So we asked if we could sit at the counter or on the patio. They said no, there is a wait for those as well. This did not make sense since when they finally sat us, those counter seats and patio tables were still empty! Next, we were not happy with the food. My wife's pancakes were very undercooked as was her omelette with very runny eggs. My Baby Chick omelette was very bland and overcooked and my Hazelnut pancakes were also very dry. We did not enjoy anything here. It was also so noisy that we could hardly have a conversation. For this type of meal I would suggest going to one of their competitors. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for breakfast. I love the chocolate chip pancakes. Today I got the country fried steak and eggs. Bomb!!!! I get it with hash browns. Service is great. You have to wait to be seating because it's always busy but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Again this place for breakfast is the best breakfast place in Vegas. I have ate at 4 different locations and every location is great. I have ate at the centennial location, south side on blue diamond, the location on Flamingo and the one on buffalo. Today I went with a party of 4 at the buffalo location and got seated right away. The server Jacob was professional and efficient. Here are some of the items we ordered. 

Portuguese sausage, scrabble eggs, garlic rice and a side of chocolate chip shirt stack pancakes. Kalua pig Benedict with hash browns and The French toast combo. 

A little trick with the French toast you should try. Ask for the French toast plan and ask for a side of peanut butter. Spread the peanut butter on one side of the French toast and put the other half of the French toast on top then Pour the syrup all over it. Heaven!!!!!! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!! I would go back again and again and again. I love there red velvet pancakes you have to order the red velvet pancakes. I also get the garlic rice and Portuguese sausage and eggs. It's the bomb!!! Some days I crave this place. Service is top notch and waiters are friendly. Again I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"4 of 5 only because the Kalua Pork Benedict wasn't that great. I'll stick to the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and stacks. Those are always the cats meow.

The hollandaise sauce wasn't fresh and the Kalua was ok. I tried it and it wasn't something I'd eat again."}
{"text":"I'm a really big fan of BabyStacks Cafe so it pains me to have to give them 3 stars. Maybe it is just their new location as I have never had a problem at their Summerlin location. (5 stars for Summerlin location)

We arrived at about 12:50PM today, more than an hour before they closed. Our server wasn't bad but the food took 30+ minutes. Maybe it's because there was a party of 16 ahead of us.

By the time our food got here, our milks were warm. My friend told the server and he got him a new one, which was nice.

I've never had a problem with the food here but this time my red velvet pancakes were dry on the outside. So were my friends' strawberry pancakes. And our bacon was burnt to a crisp. I don't like to complain and we had already said something about the milk so we didn't say anything. 

I'n still a fan of BabyStacks. This one's closer to our house but we decided that we would make the extra drive next time. I don't know if we will be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This place is not the best to me. Maybe because I am not a big fan of pancakes. I do like the hawaiian breakfast menu. But my boy friend is from hawaii and I will take his breakfast over theirs any day. It was alright but nothing to brag about in my opinion."}
{"text":"Our waitress Amanda was amazing, had great recommendations and the FOOD WAS TO DIE FOR!!! I can't express how this is the hidden gem of Las Vegas. 10/10 will come again."}
{"text":"I heard of babystacks thru a co-worker and decided to check it out with my mom to have breakfast and it was amazing!  Friendly staff to greet you as you come in and we got a table fast didn't have to wait too long. We had Lili as our waiter she had a smile on her face the whole time and was very nice she came to check on us often. Well definitely be back ,try the red velvet pancakes there great !"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place, it's kinda far from the strip but it's very worth it. I'll be making a trip here every time I'm in town. 

The adobo fried rice came out looking like and omelette I guess I didn't read that on the menu but it was still very good. 

Kalbi & Eggs came out really good! $1 extra to substitute your white rice for garlic fried rice!!!!

Lastly the large variety of pancakes was impressive, although I only got buttermilk. 

Would rather come here than aloha kitchen"}
{"text":"Being from Hawai'i, eating at Babystacks Cafe is like immersing myself back in the islands. The taste of the pancakes here is reminiscent of Oahu's Cinnamon's, and is wonderful! After dining here a few times, I can say that the servers are always very polite and make great suggestions.

In the world of pancakes, I'd have to say that the Bananas Foster was my favorite! My boyfriend however, said that his favorite was the red velvet. We also tried the corned beef hash breakfast and the rachero omelette (pics attached) which were equally delicious. Corned beef hash is such an island favorite! They let you upgrade to garlic rice for $1 extra which is well worth it. 

Next time we go back, we're looking forward to trying all the kalua pig options on the menu! Try to go early if you can so you can avoid the line. But even if you have to wait in line, there is a pokestop next door at Mongolian Grill!"}
{"text":"One star because my meal rocked. I had the Hawaiian sliders. 

The wait was 30 min at 10:15 am. We waited 10 min at our table before we received water and coffee. We then had to ask 4 times for coffee refills which took about 10 minutes each time to get. That's another 40 min. I don't want to EVER have to ask. \"Our\" waiter never actually refilled it. Mikey was too busy. Another female waitress overheard us complaining and she refilled it once. One of the meals that came out was cold. I mean cold... The cheese wasn't even trying to melt. It was not good. We sent it back with little apology from our \"waiter.\"  I had to ask for a coke refill. Again why am I having to do this? We then asked for butter for the pancakes. I swear to you 7 minutes passes and he comes back and says, \"oh I forgot the butter, do you still want it?\" No. No. No. Screw this we are done. 
As we paid and the young man asked if it was ok and we said no it was actually a bad experience for our first time there. He simply took our money and  never looked up. That's crap in my opinion. You just lost a potential customer for the duration of our vegas living. 
The \"manager\" looked just as lost as the rest if the staff while she was taking names to be seated and not back running the kitchen and doing quality assurance checks. What a crock. I chose not to say anything to her because I felt like that was a moot point as well. 
On a side note there is only one restroom for the males and one for the females. We used the men's once because it stupid to stand in line that long for the women's. This place is huge and it's not equipped to handle the volume."}
{"text":"Servers are all very friendly which adds to the family atmosphere. The food is absolutely amazing!  It's hard to find an item in the menu that I don't really enjoy.

When we had the opportunity to take a family trip.  Baby Stacks was the deciding factor in our choice of Las Vegas as a location for vacation.

Yeah, it's that good!"}
{"text":"My wife read a review someplace that raved about pancakes. She loves pancakes. So we went, she ordered bacon pancakes, a short stack. I like corned beef hash so that's what I ordered. 

She said her pancakes were okay but too thick for her, too cake like. Okay that's a personal preference.

The menu says the corned beef hash is homemade. It tasted and looked like it was from a can, maybe doctored a bit but from a can. It tasted okay but nothing special. I ordered seasoned potatoes and I swear they were a commercially available brand. I also had an order of sourdough toast but where was the butter? I slight splash of butter? C'mon. 

I can say the service was excellent but all in all we didn't find the place a stand out. We'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Great ideas for pancakes but the pancakes were stale and gross. Don't understand the reviews. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ruben sandwich a sloppy mess.Burnt meat. Fries cold and 2 salty. Club Sandwhich looked good.Great Fried Potato chips.. very good on them"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not in love with the basic breakfast I ordered, which was the sausage and eggs. The sausage and eggs were average at best but the red velvet pancakes were to die for! I would certainly go back to try some of the local favorites they had on the menu. 

Overall this restaurant has great potential I think I just have to expand my food horizons. :)"}
{"text":"The fun flavors of pancakes are really novel. We got 6 different kinds and the German chocolate pancakes (a special) were the best by far! It's a lot of sweet, so here's a tip: get a skillet or an omelet and upgrade your two pancakes to a specialty flavor. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"It was a good experience. Met a friend of mine and sat at the counter and ended up getting into a conversation with the manager, I think, who was very nice and made some good recommendations. The Mexican skillet was delicious and my friend had the mocoloco, which he swears by. The pancakes were good as well. I got a buttermilk babystack and he got the lemon ricotta which looked tasty, although I didn't try them. My one critique is that the coffee is crap. Breakfast places without good coffee are doing themselves a real disservice in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely one of my favorite breakfast spots.  The red velvet pancakes are to die for, and so are all of the sides.

They definitely get slammed on the weekends, which is to be expected, so sometimes you feel rushed by the servers to turn your table as fast as possible.  

The decor is quaint and perfect for the establishment and it is a pretty small restaurant overall.  The menu has a decent selection and something for everybody."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places. Great variety of breakfast dishes. My favorites are the Kali beef, kalua pork grilled cheese and the cookie butter french toast. Babystacks has such unique flavors- everyone should try it at least once. It's really unforgettable. I've been here close about 5 times and the wait is never more than 10 mins. Staff is always very attentive and friendly. Danielle is my favorite server, she remembers me every time. I like that's it's always very clean as well. They never disappoint! Great place"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the entire world!!

Service here is hit or miss.  But the food here is always HIT!  I have been a fan since previously known as Babycakes.  Babystacks is known for their delicious red velvet pancakes!  They are served with mini chocolate chips, whipped cream, and a cream cheese syrup.  Delicious!!

After coming here for several years, I have tried almost all the pancakes.  Cookies n cream, chocolate chip, banana cream pie, red velvet, hazelnut, honey wheat, s'mores, white chocolate macadamia (surprisingly my least favorite).  My favorites are red velvet and hazelnut.

Their seasoned potatoes are to die for!!  Absolutely delicious.  I always get a side of country gravy with them, and dip my potatoes in it.  Yuuuummm!  I love sourdough toast, and am so happy this place has real sourdough.  A lot of places say they have sourdough and serve you white.  Although their menu says the bacon is crispy, if you like it well-done, make sure you tell them (because you may or may not get it crispy).  One of my only complaints!  

There is usually a wait, especially on the weekends.  The least busy times I have found are around 2 PM.  Then you can get in and out of there in half an hour.  If you go when it's busy, expect a 20-30 minute wait.  So worth it though!"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what all the hype was about Babycakes Cafe.  I went there with 2 girlfriends for lunch.  Two of us tried the pancakes, I had the lemon ricotta, my friend had the carrot cake with cream cheese syrup.  My pancakes, more like crepes, were almost burned and crisp.  I couldn't detect any lemon or cheese taste.  They served it without any syrup and I had to ask for the cream cheese syrup which I was informed cost 75 cents extra.  I thought the ricotta cheese would be rolled inside the crepe but the 3 crepes tasted just like plain crepes.  You could do much better at IHOP for pancakes and the long wait in the small cramped restaurant just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the best pancakes ever!  This is our new breakfast place. They have a waiting line, however the wait isn't as long as they say it will be, which is good."}
{"text":"Adobo Rice Omelet.  Just do it. Like drive to Vegas and do it now.  Best Adobo Rice I've ever had and it was for breakfast. Wassup with that?  Wife had Red Velvet Pancakes and they should sell that cream cheese syrup everywhere. Great meal. Go here."}
{"text":"Wait wasn't too bad. Greeted well. 

My wife ordered the Loco Moco with Garlic rice. (she shared and it was SUPER tasty)

i got the adobo fried rice omelette. first time trying it as chicken adobo, i usually get pork adobo. It was okay, will be sticking with the pork adobo fried rice omelette. next time i will try the eggs benedict. but GOTTA have the garlic rice. haha."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. For months I came here at least three times a week for breakfast. The first thing I will say is that I've never been to a restaurant that many times and heard so many people complain about their food or service around me. They always messed up people's orders when I was in there and they did it to me a few times too. I can understand one or two mistakes here and there but they happen much more at baby cakes than any other restaurant I've been to. The waiters and waitresses always blame it on the kitchen and say they have a new cook. I've heard that one a few times spread out between months of visiting. 

The final straw for me was terrible service and attitude from a waitress that has served me many times there. I'm always real nice to the staff and I like all of them except for this one lady. I tip well and I would eat there all the time. The food is good but I'm very picky with who I decide to give my money to. If the service is bad then I will take my business elsewhere. On this particular day that made me stop going my meal had been sent back THREE times for being wrong. In all this time they never even brought my pancakes out. After the third time of having to send my food back I made a fuss about it and said \"what's going on back there? I've been here for an hour and a half. The least you guys can do is bring the pancakes out to eat while I wait for my food to come.\" 

The waitress must of had a bad day that day because she didn't give me an apology or show the slightest bit of sympathy. That's when I said it seems like you guys don't even care. You know I can take my business elsewhere right? She said \"yes, I know that and that's totally up to you.\"

That was it for me. I got up without my food and left my money on the counter (plus a $4 tip) and walked out. I'll never go back again. I took over 20 people to this place and ate there more than anywhere else in town. I might check out the other location one day but in spite of how I was treated I will never go to this location again. I hope they get some management in there that actually cares about the customers and quality of staff from the kitchen to the front door. For the record the waitress I spoke of was the only one there that I've seen wearing glasses. Terrible attitude"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My daughter and I visit often. The bananas foster pancakes are our favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great and so is the food! I am addicted to the garlic fried rice. It's so simple yet delicious. The babycakes (pancakes) are just as good. This is my go to place for breakfast. It has a friendly atmosphere and the smell of the food cooking is intoxicating. I haven't had a bad experience ever!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Ordered out of comfort zone today and greatly rewarded. Way too much carbs for my typical breakfast, but worth it once on a while. Great food every time we eat here. Come early tho or you will be waiting."}
{"text":"Been over a year since my last review & I've visited a couple times since then so an update is due!

Service has improved. No lost tickets anymore! Lol. I've noticed they're not consistent with their red velvet pancakes but I like it nonetheless. 

I'm excited to come here & try their other pancakes. They always come up with something new to create so check their chalkboard in the cashier area!"}
{"text":"This is an off the strip gem. My friend took me here for brunch after picking me up from the airport which was smart because I was starving. This place cured the hunger pains and got me ready to welcome on a fun Vegas weekend. 

The menu is large, I mean front and back large with tiny writing to fit all the options they serve. The menu covers everything sweet and savory to satisfy all palettes. The pancake selection is massive and imaginative but I had to take a stab at the Filipino options. Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice....umm yes please. Adobo marinated chicken served in the shape of a burrito covered by a delicate blanket of omelet style egg. It was a quiet brunch because I was busy stuffing my face, which I think is a compliment. Meanwhile, stacks and stacks of fun colored pancakes topped with fluffy whipped cream were being served to neighboring tables and you could see the eyes of kids light up. The service was on point too. Our waiter was friendly and checked on us consistently which definitely enhanced our brunching experience. Overall it was a delicious experience and my tummy was happy with me. Definitely seems like the kind of place that belongs in the Bay Area too!"}
{"text":"Been here probably 4 times. Its our go to brunch before leaving Vegas. Pancake was superb and the loco moco chili is delicious. Also try their adobo burrito something like that is also good. Its crowded in the weekend but weekdays has no wait or maybe 5-10 mins wait. Be back again on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Popular breakfast place in town, best known for their variety of pancake styles. 

Take note ! They only seat after ENTIRE party is there. And they get pretty busy during breakfast or lunch time (only open for breakfast and lunch, for obvious reasons)

Been here a few times. Various friends and family. So got to try different things. 

Like a normal breakfast place, they offer a variety Omelettes, pancakes, etc. They have a slight Hawaiian influence so you'll see things like kalua pork, or bbq pork, or Portuguese sausage on the menu.But the most talked about, and hyped, is their Red Velvet Pancakes. For those who dont know, red velvet is more known for the cake. Bright to dark red cake flavored with cocoa with a cream cheese icing, So essentially, simply a chocolate cake, without the overload of chocolate. 

My first time here, was with one other friend. We had tried the red velvet, as well as the banana cream pancake. Prior to this, i had been very sick of pancakes because one year, my friends and I decided to go around to different iHops on international pancake day, and eat free pancakes.... that killed it for me for a few years. So traditional normal pancakes, definitely a no go for me ! I was eager to try these new pancakes with different flavors though. 

At BabyStacks, they offer their pancakes in full stacks or half stacks, and their pancakes are smaller than the normal ones you see.  Maybe like 4-5\" in diameter vs the plate sized ones. 

Red Velvet Pancakes - As said before, its red, but essentially a lighter chocolate pancake with cream cheese icing and whipped cream. Its pretty good. Not what it was hyped up to be (maybe im not much of a dessert person anyway) but its not bad. I still do recommend people who hasn't tried it, to try it. Light chocolatey flavor with a not too heavy cream cheese icing. 

Banana Cream Pie Pancake - Traditional pancake with what you'd find in a banana cream pie so sliced bananas, a banana cream, and whipped cream. The first time i tried it, it was surprisingly amazing, Originally being a lover of banana cream pie (to the extent of not being a dessert lover... if that makes sense), this had sparked my interest in pancakes again. 

Overall, nice place to go for breakfast. Variety of stuff to order, not only pancakes."}
{"text":"How can you not love baby stacks? I always order the red velvet pancakes and my boyfriend gets the adobo fried rice omelette."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and pancakes! Whenever I visit Las Vegas we always go here. The Hamilton skillet is so good. Red velvet pancakes and bananas foster  pancakes are amazing too. Service is fast and friendly. They close as 2pm so get there soon!"}
{"text":"I have always been wanting to go here because of my friends ranting and raving about how amazing it is. 

Went here on a friday morning, nice and packed which i like to see - means this must be good!

I ordered an omelet. Built it myself. Spinach, tomatoes, peppers. Side of fruit and toast.
 
My boyfriend got the red velvet pancakes with bacon and eggs.

Oh let us not forget the coffee that was never refilled or that warm to be honest. 

Nasty. My omelet was oily and bland. 

Boyfriends pancakes was well.. a cake! Who can't like it? Nothing special really.

Never going again."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. We got there around 1130am for breakfast. I ordered the orange dream pancakes and it was very rich and the sweetness was right on point for me cause I love sweet stuff. I also ordered Portuguese sausage and it was good to but the the brand that I am used to eating in Hawaii which is purity brand. My husband had the strawberry crepes and he said it tasted good but he wished there was fresh strawberries inside the crepes too instead of just on top of it. The wait staff was also friendly. I would definitely go back and try something different."}
{"text":"I walked in with great expectations liking the menu and seeing how busy they were but a alas was painfully disappointed.

The staff was very nice and helpful but that's where things end. I ordered the Hawaiian staple Loco Moco. They had it with garlic rice for an additional charge as well as spam. Since the last place I had Loco Moco in the area (see review of Kapuna Cafe) did not have spam in the rice I ordered the garlic rice with spam. I didn't realize until it arrived that what they did was substitute the spam for the hamburger. So I got this plate which did not look appealing as you can tell from the photo with a little gravy and spam covered rice. The rice itself was salty the gravy was salty so you can imagine how it was when you added spam into the mix. At least the eggs will cooked right. Also the side of coffee and enfused chocolate pancakes were tasty.

I was really hoping they would knock it out of the park with their food unfortunately that was not the case. In fact half of my wife's dish went to our dog."}
{"text":"You will catch me with my family here every weekend! It's not just about the great food and wide variety of choices, but it's the people that make this place extraordinary! They are like my second family. When the staff remembers your name and orders, they are dedicated to customer service. Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"We never get to go here on the weekends because the wait is always at least an hour. I just had a new baby so my husband took a week off to spend with us, so we were able to go during the week and get a table right away. I got red velvet pancakes which are always my fav here, and furikake and spam garlic rice. Service is always great and gives you that ohana feeling, plus the Hawaiian reggae music totally sets the mood. I wish we could eat here more, the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish all of their locations would either add additional seating or expand so there isn't such a long wait during peak times. Even adding some tables outside could help. Put that in the suggestion box haha and thanks for the ono breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love pancakes and anything to do with breakfast. I wasn't blown away by this place. I definitely wasn't a fan of their pancakes, good ol buttermilk pancakes, but I didn't think they were terrible either....just not to my taste. Not sure if I'll return because nothing really stood out to me."}
{"text":"A very average breakfast place. If you're going to eat here, stick with what they are know for: speciality pancakes.

Tried a variety of items including an omelette, red velvet pancakes, eggs Benedict, and classic bacon and eggs. Everything was just okay except the velvet cakes which were fantastic. The whipped cream they dollop on top is a dream. I think about it sometimes. 

Overall an okay place. Service can be a bit slow. If you are craving pancakes then definitely go here. Anything else? Maybe find some place else and save a little cash."}
{"text":"I don't normally post positive reviews, but I couldn't pass up praising baby stacks. In Vegas for a couple of days and somehow winded up here for breakfast. I was surprising delighted. The price was very reasonable and good portion sizes were great. The selection is very different than your normal but believe me, bananas foster pancakes were a fantastic breakfast, and the Mexican omelette was on point!
If you've got the time and means to get a couple miles off the strip, I don't think you can go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are amazing and by far the best thing on the menu. This place gets \"5 stars\" for food! However- I'm giving it a lower score for the rudeness of the hostesses. They have two girls at the front. I was quoted \"15 mins.\" 35 minutes later I'm still waiting for a table yet I saw 6 open tables. I ask one lady at the front if I should leave as there are empty tables, and people that came after me were seated first. I'm a party of 2 mind you. She said \"you need to wait for the hostess that seats people.\" So - baby stacks - what's the point of her if she can't help your guests? Once I said I was leaving the hostess said \"okay fine go!\" That's how they treat their customers on a Thursday morning at 10:45. The waitress I had came over and said I could sit at her empty table. Her service was spectacular! The only part of my dining experience that was awful was with the rude hostesses. When I asked to speak to a manager they ignored me. All in all- come in for the red velvet pancakes but don't expect friendliness from the staff."}
{"text":"When we travel we like to support local businesses. Thus we looked for a good local restaurant for breakfast. The Babystack Cafe was a great find. It is a little drive from the strip but well worth the drive. It is clean, friendly and the food was excellent. The prices are very reasonable, I had the peanut butter and banana pancakes and they were excellent. I am glad we drove to this place. It is a very local hang out and definitely clean an friendly."}
{"text":"Having been to all 3 BabyStacks in Las Vegas, I'd say this is a very nice building and location compared to the other two. Food at the original is still the best, but this location's is of good quality as well. Great when you just have to have some Red velvet pancakes"}
{"text":"Tried serving me old bread . My bun was so hard I could barely cut it with my knife.                                                      

Was not happy with it and got my money back.  I won't be back to try anything else."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast on a Monday morning. Great menu. I ordered the Kahlua pork eggs Benedict and white chocolate and macadamia nut short stack. The service was great and the food came out very quickly. However I was disappointed that the Kahlua pork and cabbage didn't have very much flavor, and the white chocolate and macadamia nuts were served on top and not baked into the pancake batter."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice wrapped in egg! Sign me up twice. Okay, it's simple. You're from out of town visiting Vegas. You are looking for the breakfast place but do not want to spend all that dough because you want to use most of your money on the craps table. Get in your car and drive a few miles west of the strip. 

My bro and I showed up about 9:30am on a Tuesday morning. It was a full house but we were seated immediately. FYI- there is one small table in the back next to the restroom; avoid at all costs. We were almost seated there. I spoke up and we were given another table. You can also sit at the counter. I noticed a few large groups dining together, so they will accommodate. Also, they do not split checks. Time to bust out that calculator and do some arithmetic. If you have that cheap friend who never chips in for taxes or tip, you may need to throw in a few extra bucks. 

Menu is full of pancakes on one side. The other side offers their specialties. The first two items listed are the adobo fried rice and loco moco. There was no way I was going to leave that place without ordering both. Each item comes with a choice of potatoes, hash browns, etc. Went with the hash browns. Small order of pancakes comes with the loco moco or you can upgrade to the specialty pancakes for about $2. My bro had the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes and said they were some of the best he has ever had. 

The adobo fried rice was excellent. It was interesting to have it wrapped up in egg. I felt like there wasn't a lot of the fried rice inside of the egg. I should have asked for the loco moco with the adobo fried rice. I asked after the meal but they do not serve it that way. The gravy for the loco moco was rich with flavor. The rice was a bit soggy. The hamburger patty was thick and I think they used two eggs. 

Overall, food was great. I could have used more of the fried rice and the white rice was a bit soggy but the excellent flavor cancelled out the downfalls. The service was great and to top it off was the price. It was $29 for 2 with drinks and all that food. Give them a try, stuff your face, and then head back to your hotel pool and strut your six-pack. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Great food, always packed and they no longer split checks or let you sit without your entire party (even if its only two) present. But fantastic garlic rice and pancakes."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast!  I likes that you have a choice for smaller stacks of pancakes so you can try a few. We tried the red velvet and the banana cream pie pancakes. Hard to choose which was better. They were both wonderful."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite breakfast place because it is in my neighborhood, but the last two times I was not pleased at all. The employees Are not friendly at all. They are grumpy young men, really weird. They do not look in your face while they take your order and they look around while they place the plates in front of you, I felt like I bother this person. He was the one with the big golden necklace. The whole place makes me feel not comfortable and welcome, it also used to be way more clean I am not sure if the owner changed or what is going on. Definitely not a place I will visit again. You cannot act like that, too much competition."}
{"text":"I stopped by today because my coworker would not stop talking about the Red Velvet Pancakes and the Adobo Fried Rice from this place for the last few weeks. 

I ordered both so I could finally see what the hype was about. I started with the rice and I was expecting to taste a fried rice like nothing I have ever tasted before, but that is not what I got. It just tasted like regular fried rice. It came with a scoop of macaroni salad, which was bland. The pancakes were cooked perfectly, but not good enough for me to drive all the way back here for.

My friend had the Loco Moco. The hamburger patty was burnt on the bottom."}
{"text":"I read about this place on Yelp, so we decided to try it.  Wednesday about 10a.m.,  a ten minute wait - (doesn't anyone work on a Wednesday anymore??) .  I had the red velvet pancakes, Portugese sausage with egg & garlic fried rice.  The wife had honey wheat pancakes, egg beaters, Portugese sausage & garlic fried rice.   Both good!  Definitely coming back when we're in Vegas again.

Somewhere northwest of the Strip - Summerlin?"}
{"text":"LOVED the red velvet pancakes; and that wasn't even the food I ordered!! My order of eggs benedict was perfect; so mouth watering good! Also I loved that the workers were cleaning as I was there (side note: the bathroom was clean)"}
{"text":"2 stars for the food. Monica's service was below subpar. No refills, no checking on the table and gave us the wrong receipts. Her attitude today left a lot to be desired and we were overcharged. We paid but this is really unfortunate because I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and was disappointed by the food.. I had banana pancakes and a breakfast skillet.  The pancakes were chewy.  The skillet had no flavor."}
{"text":"Good service, right portion size.comfortably full but don't need a wheelbarrow to get out. haha. They don't skimp on the filings in the omelet. Lots of everything. The pancakes are small, only about 4 inches, perfect to enjoy a taste of their red velvet cakes without going overboard. A definite must when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the Red Velvet Pancakes & Rick's Adobo Rice.  Wait is always really long but soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is a Hawaiian/American fusion diner. I always have a hard time deciding on which item to pick since there are a lot of unique and delicious choices. My wife's go-to dish is the loco moco, and I usually get something different each time I dine here. For pancake lovers however, I recommend the red velvet pancakes. As basic as it sounds for you ted velvet haters, just give it a try, it's really good. I'm not much of a dessert person, but I admit they're pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow!  I've heard of this place many times + my daughter loooooves it and goes all of the time with her father, but I hadn't yet been until the other day. First of all, Zippys chili?!?!  OMG!!!  That's one of the main things I miss about Hawaii, Zippy's!  

I ordered a create your own omelette with onions, peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes and a side of red velvet pancakes.  My daughter got a breakfast with hash browns, eggs, red velvet pancakes and bacon. Both dishes were awesome + priced very reasonably. We both ate there for $18 including tax and 25% tip.  

Our waitress was awesome and service from all staff was amazing. Can't think of a single thing to complain about! 

Can't wait to go back and get the chili!"}
{"text":"Got the buttermilk short stack. Wayyyy overrated!  Dry and not at all that satisfying. Service was really good though. Not many vegetarian options other than the pancakes.  I will not be back due to very average food."}
{"text":"You better know what to order. The adobo omlette and the loco moco is really good"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place, but needed to come when there wasn't a wait. This morning, we accidentally woke up early, so we had our chance...

The pancakes are good. Not \"blow your mind amazing\", but good. Had the lemon ricotta, and they were light and fresh. Don't just dredge them in the cream cheese syrup, use it sparingly. Very sweet!

Huevos rancheros. \"What kind of salsa do you want, red or green?\" \"What's the difference?\" [blank look] \"One is red, and one is green.\"

After the meal... \"I am leaving the check for you. Have a nice day.\"  Usually that's code for get the heck out, but the place was still half empty and there was no one waiting. We wanted a 2nd cup of coffee, but couldn't get anyone's attention. Finally gave up and left...got back in the car and realized that we'd spent a whole 20 minutes having breakfast. 

So, fast food when the place isn't packed, but the service needs some training. We didn't feel welcomed enough to make this a regular stop, but will keep it in mind if we're in the mood for pancakes."}
{"text":"I hate giving shady reviews but I give this place a three due to the food being a five star rating but the service is lacking the sense of urgency. 

It's sad when the two are combined. 

I get the place is your relaxing breakfast dine, but to have your guest sitting for 7 to 10 minutes after being sat and then only taking our drink orders and then bringing it to us five minutes later and then having us flag down our server is irrelevant. 

This isn't my first time experiencing this here, but being that I work in the food and beverage industry I always try to give chances because I understand the inside and out... However, that isnt something I should have to get use to. It's annoying especially when you are hungry... the management needs to teach them that. 

Sorry, I dont mean to kill it but this is a petpeeeeeve."}
{"text":"we had a party of 10 but 2 of them were meeting up with us there. The wait for that size group on that Sunday morning was 30 minutes. since it was plenty of time for our 2 stragglers to show up before then we put in our name for a table, but those 2 were running a little late. We were brought in and seated and the man hosting who sat us at a table kept asking where the rest of our party was, we insisted they would be arriving shortly. But he kept nagging us about them and spoke to is VERY rudely and with bad attitude and a facial expression to match said to us \"You better not get me in trouble\" and he walked away. Ewe, he disgusted me and his behavior made me lose my appetite. Even my sister said she'd be happy to walk out of he was going to be a dick about it & Baby Stack's Cafe would lose out on good business and since it was our first time we could have been potential regulars. Instead we called the pair and asked them not to show up because the. Man hosting couldn't wait another 5 minutes before acting like an asshole towards us. 

Our sever (I wish I heard her name) was super sweet. She was so nice with such a pleasant attitude and very accommodating.  

The food was yummy, good enough to redeem the poor behavior we had endured from the douche of a host, but still I wish we didn't have to encounter that man before trying to enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast with my family and our blessing babies and toddlers. 

I ordered the honey French toast but it didn't come with anything g other than the two slices of toast so I had to order a side of breakfast potatoes. The French toast was great, I appreciate non-soggy toast since I'm extremely picky of food textures. I also decided I wanted to try the sweet cream crepe and it wasn't anything special, still tasty, but maybe if I had order extra topping for an extra charge I might had been more impressed. 

A couple people in our party tried the red velvet pancakes and swear it was the most delicious pancakes they have ever tried, it was so good they had a hard time trying to explain to me just how great it was, all they could say was \"it was amazing\"."}
{"text":"There is just something about these Red Velvet Pancakes that make me forget that I don't like to eat pancakes lol.

Since my initial review I've tried quite a few more items on the menu, most notably the Adobo Fried Rice omelet and the Huevos Rancheros. The adobo fried rice blew my mind. 1) Because it was delicious and 2)I'm filipino and it never once crossed my mind to mix adobo and fried rice. WHAT EVEN.

There are now two locations and the quality of the food at the new location is just as good as the quality of the food at this location. 

Also the name has changed lol."}
{"text":"Read a lot of great reviews on this place so decided to check them out since we were staying in the Henderson area. IT WAS AWESOME. If I lived here, I'd be here quite often!

First off, let's not jump to calling this place \"Hawaiian\" food. Some things in the menu are reminiscent of home... but it definitely doesn't qualify as \"Hawaiian\" food. Now that I got that out of the way...

Tons of parking in the shopping center. I came around 10am on a weekday and they were already packed. Put out names on the list and waited around 15 minutes. They're quick! The staff is super friendly. The place is clean and well-lit. Menu is super easy to understand and there are SO MANY choices! You can have you classic breakfast, or be a little more daring. I opted for a classic breakfast. 

Got the bacon and eggs. You have an option to upgrade to garlic rice... do it! Well, I love garlic so that was definitely a given. It was so good! For my breakfast, I also got to have pancakes or toast. Go with the pancakes. Don't even think about it. You can upgrade to any of their pancakes. I went with the orange creamsicle. I was in heaven! Seriously, I'm not a sweets nor a pancake person but I LOVED IT. So good. Still thinking about it today. 

The prices are reasonable. I highly recommend. Highly. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm not disappointed. 5 stars for the Lolo Ricks adobo fried rice omelette with red velvet baby stack. I shared it with my boyfriend and it was the perfect amount for us to share and still leave feeling full and satisfied.  Luckily my boyfriend does not eat that much for a guy IMO (usually he's full with just a hamburger and fries combo). I only took away one star because they close at 2p. We arrived at 12:45 and we're seated immediately on a Monday. We heard about the hype and purposely did not come here during the weekend rush. Place is clean and small-medium establishment. Will be coming back for sure whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Have visited BabyStacks a few times. I like the wide variety of options for pancakes. The servings aren't huge, but acceptable. I think the prices are good for what you get. Love the lemon curd they use, and the cream cheese syrup is yummy! I'd give 5 stars, but the wait can be ridiculous. If we go, we always do a late lunch, right before they close."}
{"text":"So drove by this place serval times and final came in. Small cozy place, with very friendly staff. First thing I notice on the menu Adobo chicken fried rice! So yes definitely ordered that, it came out wrapped in an omelet. It basically reminded me of going to my friends house (Filipino) after they had a party and in the morning making some scrambled eggs and eating some left over fried rice and adobo. Then serve have options for a side and recommended their special banana foster pancakes. Man that was just a taste of heaven! Also what was great about this place is the accommodation, since my gf is vegan they we're able to make a vegan breakfast burrito, did fresh vegetables and breakfast potatoes with avocado on the side. So needless to say great service great food definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Not really worth the wait. Food was okay, could of fit the same at IHop. For a place to be called \"BabyStacks\" the Pancakes were less than average. They have a whole menu of different pancake flavored but it's all fluff. Service was okay nothing exceptional. Overpriced for the portion size you get. $10.95 plate came put like a kids menu item."}
{"text":"This place must have the best red velvet pancakes in town. Came here not expecting much. Decided to get their Mexican omelet with a side of red velvet pancakes and it was pretty darn good breakfast. Definitely have to recommend this to others. They've got pretty long wait times so be prepared and they close pretty early too. Only reason i didn't give this place 5 stars was because they are pretty stingy with their orange juice. Lol."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Babystacks. From the great selection of music they play to the unique selection of pancakes; they have it all.

I have tried original, hazelnut, smores and red velvet pancakes... All of which have exceeded my expectations. I usually get pancakes as a side with eggs, bacon and potatoes.

I always leave Babystacks feeling like I have a food baby... Lol."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, get there early. The wait can be long but the food is so fantastic"}
{"text":"I think they must write their own reviews. Just a very average place. I just had lunch, wafer thin chicken breast, so over cooked I could barely cut it , with frozen seasoned fake fries. 
I have had breakfast here once and that was so so too. Over rated!"}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii (and being a frequent bruncher), I was so excited to find a breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas that served \"local\" food (read: food often found in Hawaii rather than authentic Hawaiian food).  Plus, I have non-Hawaiian friends who have enjoyed this restaurant so I had high expectations. 

My friend and I arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday and were pleased to be seated right away, despite a nearly full restaurant!  The service was attentive, although the server did make some strange comments and seemed absent-minded at times.  However, the server was extremely accommodating and felt comfortable providing recommendations to us, which was helpful.

I ordered the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict - a favorite from back home - without the cabbage.  Being a huge Eggs Benny fan, I was disappointed to find the English muffin was rather soggy. The rest of the Benny was scrumptious!  I wanted a side order of the adobo fried rice, but when the server told me that wasn't possible, he recommended the garlic rice. I did not enjoy the garlic rice at all - it was just rice soaked in oil, butter, and garlic.  I'm a fan of garlic, but it was very bland.  My favorite part of the meal was the red velvet pancakes!  It is not as sweet as you would expect and is much lighter than actual cake.  The cream cheese sauce topping was also perfect!

All in all, I would probably return again in hopes the soggy English muffin was just a bad batch.  There are also other menu items that I would love to try!"}
{"text":"Was in the area, so I decided to stop by and try this new place.  It was pretty busy at around 1:30PM.  
The red velvet pancake is good but the other local hawaiian food isn't that great.
Worth a try if you're into fancy pancakes.
Overall experience was ok.  Kind of a little pricey I think."}
{"text":"I absolutely never write bad reviews but I am seriously in shock by what happened this morning at this location. I bit into my omelet and bit into half of a roach! They quickly came to deal with it and still charged me for my meal. My total bill was $10, I can't believe that they actually charged me after finding a bug in my food. I did not cause a scene and I immediately stopped eating and my daughter did as well. The manager didn't even come to me  about the bug rather another waitress, when I went to pay I calmly and extremely quietly stated I was not paying for it and the manager then came and disputed me paying for this meal. The waitress we had was very good. Needless to say when they handed me the bill I then made a fuss. Gave them a chance to remedy the issue without me causing as scene but I feel because I was so calm about it they tried to take advantage of it. I'm sure this rarely happens but be careful what you bite into at this location!"}
{"text":"Visited Las Vegas for a convention and I wanted to get out of the strip to find a reasonable price for some good brunch. One of my friends suggested going to Babystacks Cafe since they are known for their pancakes and it's not too far from the strip. 

As soon as I stepped in the restaurant, I felt like I was home in the Philippines. I had no idea that this was a Filipino based restaurant so I was truly excited when I saw the menu. 

I've heard that pancakes is the way to go here, but I couldn't help and order Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. Best omelette I've ever had. It was a big omelette so I had to take it to go. They had a lot of choices for pancakes but I had to order their Nutella pancakes. 

If ever you're in Vegas and feel like having something other than the places offered at the strip, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The food was good, prices reasonable, good service. They close at 3 and if you are there past two they will start to flip chairs on to the tables and clean. Overall is was good, just get there early."}
{"text":"I think for a small joint this place is really lovely! 
Of course with a popular business, there is going to be a wait but its worth it! The food was homey&enjoyable. My ONLYYYY complaint is that is really should be an all day restaurant, not just open for breakfast hours. I cant tell you how many times Ive wanted some Baby Stacks after work!! 
Keep it up...and extend your hours!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not phenomenal, not bad. Maybe my expectation was slightly elevated because of so many people hyping it up? I Had the Kalua Benedict. It had some flavor but something was definitely missing . The hollandaise sauce a little too sour perhaps. Now what really got me disappointed was the pancakes . With a name of baby stacks I was expecting best pancakes, and honestly Ihop and original pancake house made better ones. Dry not buttery syrup wasn't sweet. And this was from trying the Cinnabon and buttermilk. Maybe an off day? Maybe I didn't order the right items.
Service was pretty good, and food wasn't horrible so I would consider coming back but just wouldn't make it a point to."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, has everything from steak and eggs to red velvet pancakes. With so many options you will want to continue to come back."}
{"text":"Darn. I heard a lot about this place from friends and I was excited to try it out, but it was rather disappointing. My four friends and I ordered different items and we were all upset and unimpressed because the food wasn't as tasty as it would seem. I got sausage and eggs with red velvet pancakes, and my friends got the breakfast burrito, corned beef with eggs and blueberry pancakes. For me, the sausage and eggs wasn't tasty at all. The quality was really cheap tasting. I can tell what a quality egg tastes like and these were flavorless and the sausage was just salty tasting, no flavor. I could make this same meal at home and it would taste way better. The red velvet pancakes did taste better than I expected, but all-in-all the whole meal was disappointing. It's also expensive for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Visited this place based on the raves we read on yelp. I ordered the spam, eggs and upgraded to the garlic rice. Def reminded me of what mom would've made on a weekend morning. Wait was long so don't come hAngry! Service was decent. Not that it was bad or anything but it was just OK - wouldn't go out of my way when I come back to Vegas. Maybe should've tried the red velvet pancakes as that seems to be the rave in most reviews."}
{"text":"They have  by far the best pancakes I have ever had!! Red Velvit with Portuguese Sausage! In addition Amanda the server was great!! Her timing on checking up with us was spot on and was very kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"I looooove their red velvet pancakes. The down fall to this place is it's always packed. The down fall to us was that everyone was getting called before us and since our party was 6 adults and 2 toddlers the host kept sitting them before us. We recommend to her if she could put two table together we can get a table. But she insist on sitting us in the very back. Besides that I love this place. Pancakes are off the hook. We were all happy and our waitress was good."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place from my coworkers that I had to give it a try.  A must order is the Adobo rice.  Yum!  
My son ordered pancakes (which I tasted and they were nothing out of the ordinary) and I got the Red Velvet pancakes. Believe the hype.  It was awesome.  I can even say it's better than Red Velvet cake! 

The host was very apologetic in getting our table while we waited.  There was a mix-up but all is good.  If you like unique pancakes, I would definitely recommend coming here.  Everything is decent but the specialty dishes are extraordinary."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice omelette ...nuff said. Service was solid, expect a wait....coffee was the only complaint... I like it black and high octane...was light and watery. Other than that I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Babystacks is just really good. This is my \"go to\" to satisfy my sweet tooth in the morning. They have a variety of different pancake creations. 

The last time I went, I got the almond joy pancakes. They were chocolate pancakes with almond shavings, coconut, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. I thought it was reeeeeally good because the chocolate pancakes weren't TOO chocolately as you would expect, I think it was the perfect amount of chocolately goodness. 

Everyone thinks the red velvet pancakes are amazing.. I beg to differ. They are just \"bleh\" to me, nothing special. I think the hype sells them. 

My usual is the honey whole wheat pancakes. These pancakes have a different texture from the regular pancakes which I really enjoy and they're supposed to be more healthy.. hence the whole wheat --so it's the one I typically order. 

The orange juice taste fresh squeezed. 

Expect 30-45 min wait times before being seated because this place is always busy!"}
{"text":"We got here around 11 and waited about 30 mins before getting seated. The wait wasn't as bad as we anticipated. This is my second time coming here and I'm only here for one reason, red velvet pancakes! I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but these are amazing!! They are just the right amount of fluff and melts in your mouth. My daughter loves the cookies and cream pancake, which she remembered from years ago from our first visit. Other than the pancakes, everything else is average. I would only recommend coming here for their pancakes. Because they are so busy, the service isn't up to par. The waiters/waitresses are not very attentive. The food also takes a while before it comes to your table, so don't come if you're starving!"}
{"text":"Trying this place out since it seems to be a hot spot for Vegas locals.  My party included 10 adults and 3 little ones.  The place was large so the wait wasnt too long which was good. They will not seat you until your entire party is there.  This is different then most places as they will seat your party if more than 50% is on site.

Pro- very clean, nice staff and the pancakes are delicious.  Price is 2 dollar signs and the do charge extra for additions which is normal in Vegas.

Con- not all food came out around the same time. My niece didnt get her pancakes until 20 min after the laat person was served. Not sure qhy it took so long, the waiter didnt say, he only asked \"is ot ok?\". My sister said yes but i would have said NO.  Outside of that- my omlet was extra brown and dry. The tomatillo sauce tasted like it came from a jar. 

My family memebers who ordered pancakes enjoyed the food.  I am not a pancake person so i will not be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I try this place and it is awful. The place only has sitting for 50 people, the wait is 40 min. or more. The pork is bland and tastes bad, the pankcake are supposed to be the best the Velvet and the food coloring is generous.  The people that service are doing the best with an overwhelming amount of customers. Have people been to the Egg and I or House of Pancakes, a hundred times better than this place.  
Hope they enlarge or get better, but this was my last time there....."}
{"text":"The service was good and the red velvet pancakes were delicious.  Garlic fried rice was a little on the bland side but was good enough to eat.  Other than that I have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Apparently I missed the  Emperor's New Clothes breakfast.  

Dreadful coffee

Mediocre Ranchero Omelette

Lackluster seasoned potatoes

Gummy and banal bacon pancakes

Uneventful RVP with synthetic tasting cream cheese syrup

But there was some great service in a local atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very good and speedy service. There was a line outside but the turnover was quick. A little small size restaurant but it was only 2 of us so if you have a larger group I suggest calling ahead to see if they take reservations.
My fav was the Adobo fried rice and loco moco. Huge portions. I did order the Banana Foster but it was ok. The bananas are carmelized, I prefer fresh and no coconut syrup.
The Mac salad needed Best Foods mayo. Their mayo was too runny."}
{"text":"My family and I went there on a Sunday, and as expected it was packed. Though the counter girl told us it would be a 30 to 40 minute wait and wrote our names on the list on the wall, with 4 people ahead of ours. The \"hostess\" was SUPER RUDE! She made it seem like they were doing US a favor by ALLOWING us to eat there! To make it worse, she started a new guest list, and after adding the next 10 customers that came in, she out those of us who had already been waiting AFTER THEM! So the 4 people in front of us quickly turned into 14 people in front of us! When I asked the hostess if she could adjust the list so that those of us who came in first could still be at the top of the list instead of the bottom, she became RUDE and snapped back \"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!\" .. well, obviously, you don't.. So, that 30-40 minute wait turned into an hour and 15 minutes and there were STILL 5 people ahead of us! Which is messed up since there was only 4 ahead of us when we got there! To make it even better, some one missed their name because they went shopping to kill time had come back 30 minutes after their name was called and was still put ahead of those who had been waiting patiently!! I regret buying those Groupon tickets for Babycakes now, because now I'm stuck either forfeiting the money or going back to that hell hole full of rudeness.  I even tried calling and speaking to a supervisor, but no one will return my calls, so I guess management cares as little for their customers as their \"lovely\" hostess.  I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!! You get more friendly service at Dick's Last Resort where they intentionally treat you like crap!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday for lunch and encountered a 30 minute wait.  This place is small and definitely does not have enough seats for all the people waiting in line to sit inside in the air conditioning.  

When we were seated at our table, I could not wait to try the heavily hyped red velvet pancakes.  I got a half order which came with 3 medium sized pancakes, cream cheese syrup and chocolate shavings.  Those pancakes were delish!  

Definitely worth a trip off the strip!"}
{"text":"The three stars are for this location and its service. I absolutely LOVE babystacks ! I've been to now all the locations and this by far was the worst. It's sad because my S.O had never been and he has this location as his first try. The customer service was terrible, as well as the quality of the food. The portions were small and cold, I requested my eggs over medium and they came to my plate runnier than a toddlers nose on a cold winter morning. Very disappointed, my banana foster pancakes had no love in them they were cold and uninviting. I am very disappointed in this location; I highly suggest the buffalo location."}
{"text":"Very local friendly! The food here is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Their service is well worth the wait, now listen, it's a wait but as I said, very well worth it! The fusion of food's here is nothing short of amazing, the staff is ALWAYS friendly, the place is clean and the selection is great also! Give it a shot, I recommend the red velvet pancakes, of course! Also check out the fried rice omelet, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited so long to come here! I came specifically for the adobo fried rice omelet and the red velvet pancakes. Both were equally delicious! I've heard that when you have more than one child you love them both equally and there are no favorites (I would imagine anyway, lol). Well that's how I feel about both of the items I had. I loved them both equally ;)

Our server was great, awful chipper for early in the AM. The best part? Not sure who she was but an older women saw my brother and I walking up from the parking lot and opened the door for us welcoming us in and already had menus in hand \"follow me\" she says. I'm such a sucker for excellent customer service. Aww shucks :)))))"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and had a different vibe. We loved the garlic rice and the menu had a lot of great choices. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is meh. 
Definitely not worth the wait when you can get better food for the same cost(price+time) on the strip at encore.  

I do really like that this is one of the few places that serves shredded hash browns real AmericaN style.  The menu is a bit Hawaiian. 

I love the Huntington skillet w country scrambled eggs.  
Pre order Togo and pick it up.  Take it back home.  Your kitchen table is more comfortable."}
{"text":"Baby stacks was great the first time I ever went chilled in the parking lot making out with my bf for half an hour never even went inside but still was great"}
{"text":"Again, not writing on my first experience at a BabyStacks Cafe, so this should say that I'm a pretty loyal patron to the establishment. In fact, been to both the North Buffalo and South Buffalo locations and never had a problem with the food or customer service. 
Coming to the restaurant, it's always busy. Fair warning: they don't seat you unless your entire group is present. The hostesses are always friendly, and once you let them know that your entire group is on, you're all back on the list for the next available table. 
I usually have the area with the lady that's got shoulder length hair with highlights, but this time the sister, cousin and I had a tatted guy with glasses. Gah... I really should start asking for names. Anyway...
Cool, friendly server that constantly checked on us and gave us updates when we couldn't get the entire order out in one go. Didn't sweat it though 'cause we got our main plates, and the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia short stack was our dessert. 
I also haven't found anything I didn't like on their menu. 
The sister had gotten the Country Benedict, and that had awesome gravy! Super savory dish. The cousin had gotten the Kalua Pig Benedict, and that is always ono! I had gotte the Huntington Skillet, and I do like a kinda classic trifecta (bacon, eggs and potatoes), but I liked more with their pico and fresh avocado."}
{"text":"I really thought we were going to love this place, but it was just okay.  The red velvet pancakes were really dense, no cocoa flavor or any flavor!  The smores was a little better, but nothing that blew us away.  I expected great service, but our server was not very friendly or attentive, had to track him down for coffee refills.  Once was enough for us, not going back."}
{"text":"The place is a mix of Hawaiin, American and Filipino cuisine a good fusion type of food. The price  and the amount served was a good proportion. Adobo fried rice was something new. We tried it and it was good didnt expect that from an American Breakfast place definitely a new twist in breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"This place was always at the top of my search results for breakfast but somehow I never made it over here until Sunday morning. We typically go to breakfast with the older crowd (7am)... so 10am was late for us and we knew there would be a wait anywhere we go. They told us 20 minutes for 2 people and we hung out outside until we were called. The dining area is tiny! but we were offered seats at the high top bar area within 15 minutes. The place was slammed but our server still managed to give great customer service. The coffee was really good! There was no flavored creamer (I didn't ask) but just half & half cups. I ordered a basic 2 egg breakfast & turkey sausage - not much to say- everything was good there. The star of the show was the cinnamon bun pecan pancakes. We ordered a short stack to split and I highly regret not ordered a tall stack! These were SO GOOD. The icing & pecans really topped it off. Definitely going to return and try the other many varieties of pancakes they offer!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food and service at this little trendy restaurant. There was a 30 minute wait, but it was on a Saturday morning. Hostess' at the front were apologetic and did their best to make sure we were updated and happy. Great customer service all-around. Girlfriend and I ordered Red Velvet pancakes and Port. sausage plate, both were delicious and fairly priced. 

Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the 30 minute wait on a Friday morning! 
I got the lemon ricotta pancakes which were to die for and my husband got their corned beef hash, red velvet pancakes and Portuguese sausage.

I have NEVER liked corned beef hash. I've tried it a million times in a million different ways and I have always thought it was disgusting, but their has is PHENOMENAL. It has a great crust, texture is perfect and the flavor is outstanding. 

This was our first time going and we will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"I liked the pancakes.  Everything else just ok. We ordered the Adobe rice and Loco moco. Pancakes: banana fosters and red velvet. I would give the place 5 starts on the red velvet.  Staff is really nice."}
{"text":"BabyStacks is solid gold!

They have multiple locations (5 if I'm not mistaken), but this is the only one I've been to, as of the time of writing this review.

So far we've tried: Country Benedict, Country Fried Steak, Patty Melt, and their famous Red Velvet Pancakes.

Everything was stellar! My favorites are the Country Benedict and the Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm not a huge sweets person, especially not for breakfast, but their RV Pancakes were unbelievably good. I kept taking bite after bite, thinking how are these so damn good? Hands-down, best pancakes I've ever had!

Their gravy is terrific, so anything smothered in it, like their biscuits and gravy, Country Fried Steak or Country Benedict are great dishes to try.

Whatever you end up ordering, do yourself a favor and order some pancakes for the table to share!

Now, onto service. Everyone here has been amazingly nice and friendly. Danielle, who happened to be our server both times, was so great, I'd come back just to say hi to her, even if the food wasn't worth coming back for, which it most certainly is!

Can't wait for more of those Red Velvet Pancakes!

Food: 5
Ambience: 3
Service: 5
Value: 5"}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I are here literally EVERY week. The staff know our orders by heart. I can't say enough good things about babystacks. Consistently amazing food and equally amazing staff!!"}
{"text":"I'd give them 6 stars if I could! Kristi our server was so attentive and so dang good at her job. My coffee and water were kept refilled and my garlic fried rice with spam was cooked to perfection. It reminded me of my grandma's fried rice growing up. And my banana pancakes were just as delicious. I really wish they would open up a location in San Diego. I'll definitely will be returning next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"On an early Friday morning, I made the trek out from the land of Providence to fulfill my obligation of the other half of a Chevy recall.  With GF in tow, together (but in separate vehicles) we battled time, traffic and distance to return to the kingdom of Hendo.

After dropping of my V-8 lama, I hopped into the Irish Pixie for one of the most serious conversations one can have...............\"Where do you want to eat?\"

Yelp makes the these kinds of decisions easy, because after a quick search we narrowed it down to two places.  After determining the capacity of our stomachs, Babystacks Cafe (BC) seemed the better option.

I must admit there was some trepidation on my part regarding this decision.  Normally, a visit to a BC can be an exercise in patience.  Not so!  On this day!!  We arrived early enough that a seat for two was quickly had!!!

I ordered up scrambled eggs with Spam and some garlic rice ($1.00 extra).  I could not help myself and so...I ordered a side of Orange Creamsicle pancakes.  

While waiting for the meal, I enjoyed great conversation and and always full cup of coffee.

When the meal arrived with happy service, I was happy. I was even happier when I requested Sriracha and it was given.  Everything was (on this morning) what I have come to know of the BC experience minus the lines."}
{"text":"I love this brunch spot! Especially the location, it's very convenient for me. The wait is usually pretty long, which is normal for every brunch spot. I came here on a Saturday morning at 10:30am and waited about 40 minutes for a party of 4. 

I always order the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes! The fried rice is huge and I always have leftovers for dinner later in the day. As for their Red Velvet Pancakes, they are so heavenly. I'm not a big fan of pancakes at all but I love theirs! It's cooked to the perfect texture with a slight crispiness on the edges. Paired with the cream cheese frosting that you drizzle all over it, along with some cocoa powder on top. It's a must try for sure. 

I'll continue to come back, they have pretty good customer service too!"}
{"text":"Love to come here for breakfast! Love the Ricks adobo fried rice and the pancakes!!!!! Service is good it really gets busy here esp the centennial location. This location is kinda smaller easy to find servers are really nice. Food is really cheap as well some of the food like the ricks adobo can feed up to 2 people! Just heads this place could really be busy!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes EVER! Enough said. Can't vouch for anything else though...so you're on your own. 

Seriously, if you find yourself in Las Vegas with a car or money in your pocket for a 4 mile taxi ride (against traffic so it's only about 10 minutes), then make sure to visit BabyStacks Cafe #2. It is well worth the visit and a good break from all the nasty cafe food on the strip!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously...red velvet pancakes? How can anyone not like this place? Yes, it is a bit expensive, but service comes with a smile.

I ordered the full stack of red velvet pancakes, with a side of eggs, and a side of portugese sausage (there were three of us). The syrup on the pancakes was amazing...the red velvet pancakes were beautiful, but sort of tasteless (at least I couldn't really tell they were flavored). However, the sprinkling of chocolate flakes and the whipped cream more than made up for it.

I love everything about this place and I would highly recommend those who only stay and play on the Strip to make this 30 minute drive to Northern Vegas for this breakfast treat.

This place also has no affiliation with the Baby Cakes bakery at M Hotel."}
{"text":"This restaurant is 20mins away from my house, but I wouldn't mind drive every morning to get breakfast here. I just want to throw out there that I think everyone that works here is happy all the time. The hostess and our server was super duper happy to greet us as soon as we walked in to the restaurant. 

My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast. It was predictable to be waiting. We only waited for around 10-15mins when I thought it would be longer. We both got the chilli loco moco. My friends that came here said to get the CHILI loco moco, not the regular one and to add GARLIC RICE. Definitely garlic rice was a life changer. My boyfriend loved it too. I love garlic and rice so it was the best thing in the world. I loved the chili loco moco because it wasn't salty at all. Everything was on point and amazing!

The only thing why I gave it a 4 star was because, the first bite my boyfriend had, he found a piece of hair. Which is totally normal in the restaurant industry. We told our server and he was very apologetic about it. The server took it to the back and made a whole new one for my boyfriend. Our server was very nice about this, because he even gave us a little discount for the inconvenience! 

I was too full to get any of the pancakes, but they do look amazing! I would definitely come back here again to try their pancakes."}
{"text":"Jamie our server incredible my 6 yr. old told me give her 5 stars the food incredible fast service great server all around excellent experience"}
{"text":"Food and service incredible. Will be back for breakfast any chance I get! The crepes out of this world"}
{"text":"My kids love coming to babystacks. The food is delicious and gives you a variety of the common breakfast foods, but with a twist of extra special goodness. I'm so happy they opened a new place closer to me on Durango."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast #2 (after Monta Noodle House). 
We ordered their signature red velvet pancakes along with their
adobo fried rice wrapped in omelet. 

The pancakes were fluffy and ever so lightly crispy on the edges.
Had a very light but distinct cocoa/ vanilla flavor. Comes with a side
of condensed milk like sauce instead of syrup.

Adobo fried rice was interesting with the egg wrapper. 
The fried rice was very good .. not too greasy but did feel the egg
flavor was a bit overwhelming. It was done well, too  -- but maybe one less egg yolk would've done it a world of good. =)

They also have other interesting items like s'more pancakes, banana cream pie pancake, etc etc"}
{"text":"They are known for there red velvet pancakes. In my opinion it tasked just like a regular pancakes. They crepes were really good."}
{"text":"We just recently moved to Henderson from Texas and were looking for a good place for breakfast. After seeing the reviews on YELP, we decided to check it out and were glad we did. We tried the chili skillet with buttermilk pancakes & sausage and egg plate with pumpkin pancakes. Both pancakes were delicious and there were so many different varieties. It's a little pricey for a breakfast place but service was good and we'll definitely keep this place as one that we'll visit regularly."}
{"text":"Delicious pancakes but their Adobo fried rice was nasty."}
{"text":"So far, so good. Their omelets are hearty and generous. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and not dry in the slightest.  I've tried the carrot cake stack and cinnamon stack, both great. I definitely recommend the cinnamon one though, they became my instant favorite.  I definitely plan on returning to try some more stuff! I found the location on smoke ranch to have better service. They don't suck, they just weren't as personal. The other location made me feel as if I were at home in my Hawaiian auntie's place! This is a definite try spot, especially if you love to brunch as much as I do."}
{"text":"Went back for breakfast this morning, was more moderate in my tummy expectations.

Got the ham & eggs again, with garlic rice and toast. Totally yummy, though the garlic was a lot stronger this time and less onion found.. not as good, got overwhelmed after a short bit. 

Hubby got the Loco Moco with the garlic rice and a short stack of the Cinnabon pancakes... loved the Loco Moco, and went nuts on the pancakes.. I tasted them, totally yummy.

The garlic rice seems to be a bit variable, but everything else has been consistently good. One thing they totally excel at, pancakes. They're the best I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"The best Red Velvet pancakes ever,they are fluffy  and delicious.Omelette was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor served with a side of pancakes.Our server was polite and professional and had  a good knowledge of the menu.Pricing is excellent. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Total let down! Went a few weeks ago after waiting for about 30min (which wasn't a surprise seeing how busy they were) we were excited because we have heard so many great things. I felt like we were being rushed (I get it you need to turn tables over) after ordering. We received our food. I feel to even call it mediocre would be a compliment. And then I was charged for a drink I didn't order and it was only two of us. Service wasn't great either everyone looked depressed I won't be back to give this place a second chance after the bad taste it left in my mouth."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian Benedict was yummy! Service was very friendly, and food was great! Also tried the carrot pancakes, which were great!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now, and I've never gotten to posting a review until today. I think this place is amazing! Their food is delicious and really good. I love the cowboy skillet. I would really recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean nice place, that serves delicious food."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, so much so that one of the servers, Efrain, recognizes us. It makes the experience much better when someone asks you how you have been and takes care of you the way he does. He makes you feel relaxed and smooths over any issues. 
The food is always good and as non-believers in red velvet cupcakes, we are in love with the red velvet pancakes! Definitely our regular spot!"}
{"text":"Had red velvet pancakes.  They are of high dessert quality.  Great.  Everything is served in good portion size. You'll probably need a box."}
{"text":"Service here is a bit on the slower side compared to other breakfast places in the area. It will take some time for you to get a seat and even more time to get an order taken. So if you are on the run, you might want to come early to have more time. 
I had the cookies and cream pancakes. They were good, although slightly too sweet in my book. My dad had the senior breakfast with eggs, bacon, and pancakes. Didn't look that amazing- actually maybe IHOP or Denny's wow only with a higher price tag. 
I'm not in a rush to head back there, but I might give them another chance later. $7.95 for 3 pancakes/9.95 for 6 on most of the special pancakes."}
{"text":"If you love to eat breakfast, THIS IS THE PERFECT RESTAURANT! The smell of the food is amazing!
My brother told us to eat here because of the reviews he checked on here. We checked all the pictures before we ordered. Everything looks so good!
I ordered the Portuguese Sausage, Eggs, & Rice. It comes with pancake, of course.
And also had the Almond Joy pancake. There's so many choices! 

Lots of people came, so if I were you.. Come in the morning as soon as it opens. It gets a little crowded and so many kids too. They have great services here!
I give this a 5 star (:"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with my boyfriend and each time has been great! Got the strawberry pancakes and the banana pancakes and couldn't have asked for better!"}
{"text":"This food is sooooooooo good, came to Vegas for vaca and have come back for breakfast several times. The tiramisu pancakes are to die for. All the skillets and omelets I've had have been amazing. Food perfectly seasoned. They always seem understaffed but the wait times weren't too crazy and the food makes up for it bringing it to 4.8 stars."}
{"text":"Everything here is 100%  yummy! I always have such a hard time picking what I want to eat because everything is so darn tasty!!! The variety of different flavored pancakes is the best, and if you haven't already read from everyone elses reviews the red velvet pancake is a popular favorite! Mine included. I don't know what it is, but thier batting for the pancakes is delicious. Soft and perfect for the pnacake enthusiast. 
There is almost always a line, especially if you have a big group. But I think its worth it, the staff and gals here are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered the red velvet pancakes. Fresh made to order . I have  to give a 4 star because I was sat near the bathroom and too many people walking past me bumping me while I eat."}
{"text":"6/18/18

My family and I arrived here at 12:30 pm on a Monday.  We have been here many times and knew this place might be busy. Our party of 10 checked in and we were willing to wait to be seated. The young lady in the front informed me that there was a whole section around the corner that was ready, but that it was closed and we would have to wait 20 minutes to be seated. 20 minutes?!  Really?!  I ask her why, but she wasn't sure so I asked for the manager. A few minutes later a young man with big red hair came over. I've been here enough to know that he wasn't the main manager, but he might have been the person in charge since I know he's worked here for awhile.  I asked him why we have to wait 20 minutes when there was open seating enough for us all?  His answer was because there was only three servers, so that section was closed. I was confused at that answer because I've seen this place packed out before with only three to four servers and today, it wasn't even as busy.  Although the staff was not rude, my family and I weren't going to wait for seating when seating was available. This is VEGAS!  There are way to many places to eat here. If you want to hang on to your customer base these are the kind of thing you need to avoid.  We ended going to Hash House A Go Go were there was no waiting."}
{"text":"Sooooo I have been waiting to try these red velvet pancakes for a loonngg time and I think I got too hyped up and had too high expectations for these. Once I actually tasted the pancakes, my spirits kinda fell. I mean, they were good, but they werent very red-velvety.. like they were just regular red pancakes with delicious cream cheese frosting. Still good but not what I expected. I also got the kalua pork benedict which was done very good however overall as a breakfast place, I would not come back. Their breakfast choices and taste just weren't enough to keep me thinking about it afterwards nor did the red pancakes make a big impression."}
{"text":"I love me a good brunch, especially after a night of heavy drinking in Vegas.  Babystacks is a good option if you have a car and want to get away from the Strip for a second.

I came here after one such night in Vegas last month, and a delicious fusion brunch was exactly what I needed.  The wait for our party of five wasn't too long, only about 20 minutes or so (compared to our epic wait the night before at Bachannal, this was easy peasy).  

I ordered the adobo fried rice, which comes out wrapped in an omelette.  The dish normally comes out with macaroni salad, but they let me change it out for the breakfast potatoes.  I liked the fried rice, but honestly I thought the entire dish was a little dry.  The breakfast potatoes were lightly fried and cubed, so it was hard to go wrong with these.  

Since there were a few of us, I was lucky to try some other things too.  The loco moco was amazing, hands-down the best dish we had at the table.  The sauce was on point and the beef was so good, especially for the hungover.  The Kalua pig benedict was good, although not super impressive.  While everyone at the table raved about the white chocolate macadamia nut and red velvet pancakes, I personally thought they were both a bit dry.  Of course, you can dunk the red velvet in the cream cheese dressing on the side, but that's just a bit too sweet for me.  Maybe it's because I'm not really a sweet tooth, but I'd come back for the loco moco.

Service:  Pleasant and friendly.  Ma-and-pa local run kind of place.

Bottom line:  You know those dishes where you try a bite of your friend's and you wish you had ordered that dish?  Loco moco.  No regrets.  And if you have a sweet tooth, try the red velvet or one of the other pancakes."}
{"text":"Amazing! Babycakes Cafe is soo delish!

A girlfriend of mine told me about the hype so I decided to look it up on Yelp for confirmation. After seeing all the rave reviews we decided to save Babycakes Cafe for a Sunday brunch meal.

YES it was a long wait. We arrived at 10:20am and we were seated about an hour later.

That said...I feel that the wait was worth it. Everything was fresh and delicious.

Our order-

short stack of red velvet pancakes
huevos rancheros
pulled pork eggs benedict

The RED VELVET PANCAKES are really that fabulous! I'm a huge fan of red velvet anything regardless (so long as it's good cake of course) and I was a little concerned that red velvet pancakes would be too sweet for a brunch item but it was a perfect balance. It definitely had that distinct red velvet taste and smell but it wasn't overly sweet, it still tasted like a pancake. There was a sprinkling of chocolate chips and a small cup of cream cheese frosting syrup...WOW. It was so delicious :) Go to Babycakes Cafe for their delicious pancakes, it's something new, cheap, and I didn't mind the long drive from the Strip."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes every time  a little dry so make sure you drench it in sauce haha"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are delicious & I don't usually like pancakes. They come with a side of cream cheese syrup & whipped cream topping. Soo yummy & not too sweet. We also had the kalua pork eggs Benedict with hash browns. The eggs Benedict was a little over cooked but tasted pretty good. Would definitely come back for both of those!"}
{"text":"Our family came in for breakfast today...we waited 55 minutes to be seated (which we were totally willing to do) but the problem began when the host (tall blonde kid with a man bun) welcomed his sister & her friend into the restaurant (after we waited nearly an hour) and then sat them before us. My husband became upset (understandably so) and had a confrontation with the young man host. The host then admitted to us that his sister called in to be put on the list & was sat minutes after arriving. We also called ahead to be put on the list and were told that was not an option. There's also a sign stating you can't call in, you must be present. 
Anyway, the situation escalated and my husband became upset after waiting an hour, calling it to the hosts attention and nothing being done.
Enter Monika Rodriguez. She came over without knowing the situation and suggested we leave. I waited til my husband walked out to talk to her. I explained yes I agree my husband was upset and probably got too upset. I explained I would however really like to talk to the owner so I could make her aware of what happened. Monika treated me EXTREMELY poorly in front of other customers & staff. I NEVER raised my voice, I NEVER argued (I in fact was apologizing that my husband got so upset), I explained no problem we would go but I just wanted some info first. She REFUSED to listen to anything I said. I told her what the host did and she said no way he did...I said ask him, he just admitted it.  She said oh well, I'll talk to him. She kept saying I refuse to give you the owners personal information. I explained AGAIN I didn't want anyone's personal information but I would like a contact office number or surely the owners email. I was denied all of these. Look, I'm a Regional Property Manager. I understand customer service. We were completely shafted by what the host did. Yes my hubby got upset. But I stayed behind to calmly discuss and I was treated horribly. Not cool babystacks. Not cool at all. I don't care how good your pancakes are, not worth being treated so poorly."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!!t Best pancakes in town.. The pineapple upside down cakes are the best."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Every time we have guest from out of town we bring them to baby stacks and everyone is satisfied! It does get busy so the wait is long sometimes but it's worth the wait! They need to bring back the tiramisu pancakes they're my favorite!"}
{"text":"This location is less busy than the others and a lot larger. They always have very friendly and prompt service. Also the good is delicious! Very creative pancakes and their seasoned potatoes are yum!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! I had the loco Moco with garlic fried rice! My husband had the red velvet pancakes and that was really good! Next time I will get that...all to myself :) the staff is very friendly! Love this place"}
{"text":"I had a yearning, a longing. Something was missing during our trip to Vegas. What I needed was...... 

***RICE***

Why do I have to be Filipino? Why couldn't the numerous restaurants and huge variety of food on the Vegas strip satisfy my tummy? 

I looked up Filipino restaurants on Yelp and found a couple of them (many were off the strip). But I hesitated, afraid I'd be disappointed by the lack of quality in the dishes and I did not want to take such a risk. I searched further as my tummy growled and mumbled \"rice, rice, rice\". Then I hear my toddler say, \"Mommy, I want wice!\"

Then I see it. BabyStacks Cafe. I browsed through their menu of delicious goodness. Kahlua Pork, whaaaat? Red Velvet Pancakes, whaaaat? Garlic Rice, whaaaat? Can you just imagine a big plate of those three dishes and a cup of joe? I was so excited, my mouth watered. I said, \"Screw you, food at the Strip! I'm takin' my tummy elsewhere!\" 

This cozy, little restaurant was very welcoming and we were seated immediately. Of course it was only 8:30am in the morning but there were already many people there. We ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which was wrapped in eggs, like an omelette. The hubby loved it. There were so many dishes to choose from... I decided on the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs with GARLIC RICE and a side of buttermilk pancakes. The corned beef was very, very good. Usually when I order this item at other restaurants, it was ehhh but I was really pleased here. As for the garlic rice, it was a little bland for my taste but still delicious. For me, it's all about the stanky breath after eating garlic nawmean!! The red velvet pancakes were fluffy and warm.

Just down all these dishes with a cup of coffee and you'll find yourself in a happy place :) 

We have decided that whenever we visit Vegas, BabyStacks will be our breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Service, wonderful.  Pancakes, leaden, could've been used as a doorstop. Even though the menu was inventive... It just didn't add up.  

What's with the cold syrup in the little cafeteria cups??? This is a place that specializes in PANCAKES. I get something poured into a cup from a jug with no flavor? You can do better. What's with the packets of cold butter next to my leaden pancakes? Butter should be soft, pancakes should be hot. This is breakfast 101 folks.

Syrup goes on the table or comes heated from the kitchen.  Pancakes are light and fluffy. 

Perhaps the Hawaiian fare is better, but if your star act can't pull off a good show, I'm a bit cool on the understudies.  

Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here and Josh was our server. Week worth the few minute wait. The Carrot Cake pancakes were simply amazing!!!  Everything came out hot and Josh was always at the table with a smile and making sure we were all set. For 7 of us it was under $70 so the price was definitely right. This place is worth the trip if you don't live in this part of town. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Probably the best Babystacks location in Vegas..!

We came here on a Sunday afternoon around lunch time. I was worried it was going to be a minimum of 30 min wait like we experienced in the other locations, but to our surprise we got seated right away!

They were pretty busy today but we got just the right amount of service.

Today's visit we tried the adobo fried rice, sausage and eggs, and of course the famous red velvet pancakes! We left very full and satisfied :)

I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes are GREAT here! However the price to portion ratio is a bit steep. We ordered the red velvet pancakes (short stack), spam sliders with seasoned potatoes, cowboy omelet with hash browns and banana pancakes.

I only truly loved the red velvet pancakes. Everything else was mediocre. The spam sliders were a letdown. It's was mostly egg with small bits of diced spam. We barely tasted any. 

Service was decent. And they were fairly quick with our food considering how busy they were. 

The restaurant itself is not that big. But it's definitely a bit more spacious than the original restaurant. 

I recommend trying this place for breakfast and ordering their red velvet pancakes. I'll definitely come back when i'm in the mood.  However be prepared to wait at least 30 mins during peak hours."}
{"text":"You have to try this place at least once if you like breakfast food. Or if you like pancakes. Their skillets are always good, as well as the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"After noticing the 5 stars, me and the bf decided to give BabyStacks a try. So glad that we did, it was deeellllicious!

I ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes, which I'm sure you've read, were excellent. They had just the right amount of sweetness to them and came with an excellent cream cheese syrup. These combined with a cup of coffee = heaven.

The bf ordered the HM1 Skillet that to our surprise, didn't taste like any old skillet, it actually had flavor! And lots of it!

The only thing that I would change (but not enough to knock down a star) would for it not to be so dang hot in there! Open a door, some windows, turn on a fan, anything! ;)"}
{"text":"I think this place is awesome! There is always a line and you have to wait, but I think if that's the case then theres a reason and the wait is worth it! If its your first time, please don't get turned off by the wait as you will not regret it. Breakfast was the kalua Benedict, adobo fried rice, and their special cookies n creme pancakes. As others have stated try all the other pancakes before thw red velvet because those are the best in my opinion!  As usual it was busy but service was great, staff is friendly, and the food arrived in a very decent amount time given how much people were there. The kalua Benedict is great! Smokey, savory kalua pig with hollandaise sauce and potatoes. The potatoes are awesome crisp and tender with great flavor. The kalua Benedict is definitely a must. Then the adobo fried rice.... just greatness wrapped up with an omelette! ! The adobo is nice and salty but not to much with the mac salad on the side this is winner and is highly recommended to try for your first time. The pancakes were a great surprise!! Chocolate pancakes were light but dense, I know weird but true! With cookie bits and an awesome syrup these pancakes was mean!! If they are still on the menu try these and then order a side of red velvet pancakes lol! I think there is nothing that will disappoint at Baby Stacks!! Definitely a must try place when coming to vegas! But I live here so I can anytime, chee!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times before and the food always tastes amazing. I always get the red velvet pancakes! They are the best in town, I have had them at a few other places and they don't measure up to the ones here, not even close!

But why the 3 start rating do you ask? The pregnant waitress is completely rude. My boyfriend casually asked \"Can you split the check please?\" We were with a group of friends. And she says \"No, don't you see the multiple signs up? We don't split checks\" What the hell! I have worked in customer service for 6 years of my life and I would NEVER talk to a customer like that. The proper way to answer the question is \"I do apologize but we don't split checks, I am so sorry for the inconvenience.\" 

If you hate your job or don't like people you should get out of the customer service industry. People need to learn to treat customers with more respect and speak to them with MANNERS! 

That last time we ate here she left a bitter taste in my mouth. I probably won't return to this location ever again, I hope the other locations have the decency to hire people who have manners."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was awesome. So good, my husband and I went back the next morning.  He didn't try the red velvet pancakes and couldn't stop thinking sbout them so we had to go back to try them. Totally worth it!  Very sweet but were very good.  The service was excellent both days as well as the food. We highly recommend this place to everyone!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT! We had a group of 8 and were seated pretty much immediately, great service, fast, efficient and very friendly! 
Our waitress took our order and asked if no one was going to try the red velvet pancakes, so we had her bring an order (short stack was plenty!) to share. They were AH MAY ZING! My S.O. loved the omelet, and I had the Cinabon pancakes, everything was fresh and very good. Coffee was strong and good, too.
 I was so disappointed with all my meals in Vegas except this one!
Will definitely go back, it was very much worth the trip."}
{"text":"What a fun, cute little place to go for breakfast! They don't seat incomplete parties, and can be quite busy, so you may want to take that into account if you're going at a popular brunch time. 

This was my first trip here, and luckily, I convinced my dad to split some sweet pancakes and a savory eggs benedict, so I got to try both! The coffee was good and the service was friendly- overall it was a good experience!

I would strongly recommend the Lemon Ricotta pancakes- they are closer to crepes than pancakes, light and lemony, with a delicious sweet cream cheese syrup. I sprinkled a bit of lemon on them as well, which added a bit of extra zest!

The Kalua Pig Benedict was okay- the pork was tender and flavorful, but the \"hollandaise\" sauce was closer to congealed and brought the dish down quite a bit. It wasn't terrible, but I would try something different next time. 

Other dishes at our table included a skillet (looked delicious) and the red velvet pancakes, which were basically cake disguised as breakfast and well appreciated all around."}
{"text":"If you love breakfast food, you won't be disappointed. We went on a Sunday at 2:00, an hour before closing and they were pretty busy. But we got right in and food didn't take too long either. Lots, maybe too many items to choose from on the menu. My husband loved the Cinnabon pan cakes."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends (Group of 5) for breakfast. Luckily we came before the place got busy. Two of us ordered the iced tea. It was just okay. Watered down and not a lot of tea flavor.

For main course I had the Cowboy Omelette with cinnabun pancakes. I also tried the carrot, red velvet, and wheat pancakes. Ranked from most to least favorite: Cinnabun, Carrot, Red Velvet, then Wheat.

The cinnabun pancakes was flavorful and not overly sweet. I would highly recommend this pancake. The carrot pancake was good but couldn't taste the carrot flavor. It was very mild and it basically looked like the wheat pancake but a little sweeter. The red velvet was fairly dry and the melted sugar overpowered the red velvet. 

The cowboy omelette was okay. The eggs were overcooked but there were lots of ingredients in it. I would have preferred the eggs to be a little more watery and the vegetables a little less overcooked. The fried potatoes were okay. It was not overly salty and not burnt at all.

Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars. This place is good for breakfast and I would come back here again. Portion size was excellent. They do give a lot for breakfast. Unfortunately, it just missed the mark on certain things. Service was excellent. Pancakes here are excellent. Next time I'll try their french toast and another egg dish to test."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Always busy but worth the wait. Red velvet pancakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Babycakes for a few months, and I am pleased to say it lived up to the hype and then some.  Hubby and I had omelettes and upgraded to \"specialty\" pancakes--red velvet and carrot.  Can't decide which were better.  I thought they would be too sweet, but they were just right.  Service was excellent, as was the coffee (Seattle's Best).  No, this is not some cheap breakfast joint.  It is a gem!"}
{"text":"Stacks and stacks of stacks. Delicious! 

We met some friends here to try out their breakfast.  I had read it gets quite busy on the weekend so I avoided that.  We were seated immediately and didn't know how I was going to make the choice from an extensive pancake list.  Luckily my husband and I split one of the pancake choices and one of the omelettes. 

Our choice was the Cinnabun pancakes and the Mexican omelette.  The Cinnabun pancakes is a sure winner.  You can't go wrong when you combine cinnamon, sugar and pecans.  Plus the full stack is huge and was glad we shared! The Mexican omelette was good and almost too spicy for me.  Their hot jalapeños and marinated carnitas were a great combo for sure.  It was good but would probably try a different option next time.  

Service was good and very friendly.  Our group had a great breakfast here and would be happy to come back."}
{"text":"My goodness this place is good and bountiful.  It's and abundance of food for a descent prices.  They have very unique flavors of hotcakes and a variety of other dishes.  I ordered the country fried steak and seasoned potatoes which come with a side of buttermilk pancakes.  The potatoes amazing country fried steak was good however I could have had less gravy but no big deal.  Not huge cakes but a great side compliment and it will fill you up.  I will be back to try more of this menu.
Rockford pancakes were pretty good as well with nuts on the side."}
{"text":"Delicious loved the atmosphere and the food. It was busy but still fast. Would visit again for another delicious pancake."}
{"text":"crepes delish. red velvet stacks delish. cookie butter fresh toast amazing ! definitely stop by. kinda tight to sit but it's always pippin cuz s it's so good"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and my daughter absolutely loved her Cinnabon pancakes. I got the biscuits and gravy (my all time favorite) and am quite disappointed. Perhaps I am spoiled, however there was not enough gravy to eat all of the biscuits, no sausage chunks in the gravy, and the gravy had a sweetness to it. I also got the seasoned potatoes and those were awesome! $15.94 for breakfast, not too bad, however not worth it for me, personally."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I love how they offer a variety of pancakes.  Not only is the food great,  but the staff all around are awesome."}
{"text":"Great service I would totally recommend this for breakfast or brunch . I would eat there every day if I could."}
{"text":"What a let down, I am starting to think Yelp is getting worse how it gives out stars. VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious, filling, and reasonably priced.  This small cafe only seats 50, so if you have a large party expect a wait. Service is efficient and friendly. They have an expansive list of pancake options. Including everything from red velvet, s'mores, and bananas foster. We loved it and will definitely be back on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Usually super busy here, but they do have great pancakes! I always get the Carrot Cake ones!"}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT!!!! 
My husband and I desperately needed a break from the strip and all-you-can-eat average buffets. On our last morning in Vegas, we hit up this little gem and it was outstanding. 
I had the red velvet pancakes and they totally reset the bar for my breakfast dining expectations. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated, but once we were, the service was exceptional and the food was amazing. 

Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Wow what a place! The food was delicious I had  spam, egg and Garlic rice it felt like i was back home at  my moms house. The coffee they use is great not that water down stuff other restaurants use. The staff is very friendly and work fast to accommodate every person waiting. We did wait a few but we did go on a Sunday. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"This review is solely on costumer service. I went to Babystacks a month or so ago with my husband, father in law, and daughter. We walked in and they were not busy. There were about 3 tables with people eating. When we walked in I was asked how many and told the girl in the front 4 people. She said it would be about a 5 minute wait. I immediately didn't understand because they were not busy at all. There were a couple of dirty tables that had looked like they had been sitting there for a long time. We sat there for 25 minutes or so while the staff stood in front of us and were talking and joking with each other instead of cleaning up the dirty tables or seating us. 

After waiting 25 minutes we simply walked out. As we were getting in our car a employee came out and yelled \"Hey do you guys still want a table?!\" I was shocked at the employees behavior and lack of costumer service. I didn't even eat the food but I will NOT be back. This place seriously needs to get their employees under control and teach them how to act professionally."}
{"text":"Hands down my all time favorite breakfast spot! Ever! I've been here countless times. Their pancake game is serious. I typically order the two egg breakfast with an upgrade for their specialty pancakes. The bananas foster, red velvet and chocolate chip pancakes are among my favorites. I definitely recommend to anyone looking to try a new breakfast place."}
{"text":"The pancakes were great. I had the red velvet and my friend had the orange cream.  Both were amazing.  There was a long wait just to get in, but it turned out to be totally worth it. If you ared in the area, this place is a must.  Check it out. Service was pretty spot on too."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are great. When they first arrive, you think they might be tough, but they are ever so tender and light. I wish they brought a little more syrup and they definitely need more space. I am not big on eggs or other breakfast food so I can't vouch for that. My service has always been good; Vangie, my server last time, was great. My almost-2-year-old gets so excited if we \"get pancakes!!!\""}
{"text":"Love Babystacks variety of the pancakes and it's now across the street from my house....The place is small but the wait usually isn't to long...Also the strawberry lemonade is delicious"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and this is one of my favorite places and the one thing that kept me away was the wait.  But now if I'm hungry and can muster up enough residual energy in the morning to get all they south on Buffalo to their new location I can have a great breakfast and nearly immediate seating.  

I've had pancakes, I've had adobo fried rice, and I've had the regular breakfast fare in past visits and have been satisfied with all my choices.  This is a place I like since my coffee cup never goes empty, I leave just full enough, and everything looks like it would in a picture menu, made with care and ready to be devoured.  

So if you want a varied menu with unique breakfast items along with traditional favorites and varying twists, then this is certainly a place to visit.  The northern location has limited seating but this location on South Buffalo is far bigger with the same greatness as the original."}
{"text":"I've been to the location on Durango a couple times .. You can tell it's def not the same cooks, overall \"OK\"..

The food lacked a little flavor in the food.. Some salt maybe? 

Food items chosen :
* Nutella Crepes - simple, thick, Nutella crepes topped with whipped cream and almonds 
* Country Fried Steak (comes with your choice of eggs, side potato and pancake) - crispy outside, moist inside, nothing special 
* Plain Pancakes - served with butter and syrup
* Side of Portugese Sausage - had to get a side of it, who doesn't like Portugese Sausage ¯\_(?)_/¯
* Chili Moco (comes with eggs and side of potatoes) - Loco Moco smothered in chili, at first sounded good but when actually eating it.. It was pretty bland.. I was expecting a more authentic Hawaiian chili and the ground beef patty needed flavor.. Eggs weren't that great but the seasoned potatoes were good..

Expected more out of the items because I enjoyed the previous visits at the other location.. They just need to add a touch of love to the food. 

Service was kind of slow but staff were still friendly ..

Maybe the food will get better as time passes.. But will most likely come back considering it's close to home.."}
{"text":"Babystacks Cafe is an amazing breakfast spot for several reasons.  First reason being...It's always slammed.  Unless your there when they unlock the doors, you're gonna wait.  That wait might vary..but you're gonna.....wait.  The second reason being that the food is awesome!

On the most recent visit, we were informed the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  I could feel the spike in my blood pressure, but this is Babystacks, and the food breaks the mouth, so we sat.  No less than five minutes later, we were seated and I was happy.

On this day there would be a coffee and a water.  The meal would consists of a Spam Scramble.  Spam is comfort food to me.  Eggs and Spam, rice with the delicious seasoning.  Oh, and add the garlic rice upgrade?  YES PLEASE!  To boot...you can upgrade to your favorite baby stack.  I dig me some of them banana foster flapjacks.  It's a cheat day.....BOOM!

Set your cell phone off to the side and enjoy your company cause a little Aloha time is gonna push kick da chest.  Chill.  It's all worth it.

When the food arrived and after asking several people for the Sriracha sauce it was everything I knew it would be.  Spam is yummy but attack the panny kakes while they are still warm!"}
{"text":"The banana foster pancakes were good, but the wait time was not worth it.  The restaurant is not much bigger than a whole in the wall.  We had to wait more than an hour on a Sunday at around noon.  The service was mediocre.  Definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is delicious. First off I had the Mexican skillet which had tons of flavor and good size portion. The best part was the red velvet pancakes. These pancakes are like crack. Eat breakfast here you will not be dissapointed, great staff and awesome menu"}
{"text":"this place is best for breakfast and lunch. the staff are friendly. the price is a bit cheap here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go-to spot for breakfast with friends and family that are in town visiting! Babystacks has a variety of scrumptious pancakes - we usually make sure everyone gets a different kind so we can all share. It is common for a crowd inside but the food is well worth the wait! 

They used to split checks by pairs without issue, but now only split a check in half a single time. When we go to Babystacks with groups larger than 4, that can be quite inconvenient.

Bottom line: the food is delicious, worth the small wait you might experience during a lunch rush, and best enjoyed with 2-4 people in the group."}
{"text":"3.25/5 
good breakfast grub
Little weird that staff has meetings in the dining room but it's all good
Priced decently. Staff is on point
Food came out staggered which was a bit awkward too... When you're watching others eat it's unnerving for some at the table."}
{"text":"I swear, the weekend starts to roll around and I begin fixating on the a-MAZ-ing banana pancakes I had.  Once.  Can't get them out of my mind.  And then there was the adobo fried rice that was recommended to my husband by a friend.  Mmmm....  But back to the pancakes.  Generous amount of fresh banana slices with a banana sauce on fluffy pancakes served with light whipped cream.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Pumpkin pancakes with graham sprinkles and cream cheese frosting & whip cream. Yes and yes. I had their  banana foster pancakes time before which was absolute heaven. The pancakes are just a touch sweet, but not overly so. Everything is very tasty and well prepared. I always come here when I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I still like the island inspired dishes, the chill vibe here and budget wise is great for families . ..but the pancakes, still blah.. :sighs:.... 

Those drool worthy pix are slightly misleading. Whenever I get an upgraded stack, I ended up wasting 3/4 of it, just eating the topping.  Granted Babystacks comes up with creative dressings, but take all that away and have it plain, you're left with a DRY, lifeless, flat pancakes.  Yeah that's right F. L. A. T.. I don't know why the hell they're described as fluffy. At least it cheap enough that you don't feel ripped off.  With other places rockin Asian Fusion breakfasts, Babystacks needs to step it up, or more like fluff it up."}
{"text":"Excellence at its best. #ricksfriedriceadobo What an ingenious idea to infuse an omelet, fried rice and pulled pork adobo together. #bellyboner 
the butter milk pancakes are soft and fluffy but peeps red valvet pancakes is yet another entree that is a must to have.
Waited close to an hour. The aroma of the food entices you to impatiently wait. All the food was so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Best food we had in Las Vegas this trip, hands down.

I had the basic breakfast with bacon and eggs, and upgraded the pancakes to the german chocolate.  I don't normally care much for pancakes, but these were fantastic, better than some german chocolate cakes that i've eaten.  Highly recommended!

My dining companion had the lemon ricotta crepes, and the lemon sauce was really, really good.  

We liked Baby Stacks so much, we came back our last day on the way to the airport.  Rather, we detoured to get here, since it was in the opposite direction.  Great food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food was pretty awesome! Not your typical breakfast at all- a twist with flavored pancakes and rice as an option for your side are some of the things that made this place memorable for me. So here's what I say is a MUST- Rick's adobo fried omelette. It was amazing. Mouth watering, and spiced to perfection. Also- the Nutella crepe. It was served at the next table and we couldn't stop staring. We regretted not ordering it. Last, the red velvet pancakes. Everyone loved them, they were fluffy and not too sweet. Other good items were the banana pancakes, garlic rice, and regular omelette. They weren't crazy delicious, just basic and good. So if you decide to go to one of the 4 locations, get the adobo omelette for sure, it's worth the wait and drive."}
{"text":"This review is an update on our server.  It's rare to find a good server, and today Jacob was the exception.  Extremely attentive, checked in on us multiple times, cleared plates as soon as they were ready, kudos to whom ever hired him.  Good staff like this can make a good restaurant great.
Next time you come to Baby stacks as to be seated in Jacobs' section, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Everything I ate had great flavor!
The Portuguese sausage had a nice snap to it while having a sweet but savory flavor. The country potatoes are classic and flavorful with seasoned salt and has the right amount of crisp on it. 
The lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for! It has a slight lemony flavor and the sauce (instead of syrup), is a light icing flavor syrup. They have a nice consistency and don't feel heavy. They are almost as light as a crepe but a little thicker.
My husband, who is picky about pancakes, loved the lemon ricotta and the honey whole wheat. 
We are making this our usual spot!!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes, but I had to try this place because of their fun-flavored pancakes. This place is perfect for those with a sweet tooth such as myself. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes, and I finished every last bit of those. They were delicious! We had good customer service, though we did have to wait to be noticed and seated. Other than that, great experience! I'd definitely go back to try more of their pancakes."}
{"text":"I have a lot to say about this place, as we tried a bunch of stuff.
I found it on yelp,just looking for a breakfast venue I hadn't been to yet. Took my wee one that day.
They have a vast variety of pancake types, a special of the day for pancakes, and are known for their red velvet pancakes.

Heres my rundown of plus and minuses:
-for our two regular breakfasts,with upgraded pancakes, I had coffee and oj, she had apple juice,after tip our bill was $30!!!!!!!!!!
+red velvet pancakes are fan~freakin~tastic
-not real orange juice
+overall a tasty breakfast
-a very small venue,which is super busy
-for the size of the food/price, we didn't have much to take home

I would return again by myself to keep cost down, because those red velvet babies are delicious. My daughter wasn't a fan of red velvet anything until trying these. Those little chocolate chips, whipped cream, and cream cheese syrup really create the perfect toppings."}
{"text":"Usually it's me asking to return to a brrfst place-my husband keeps requesting this one,lol
He was very skeptical on the red velvet pancakes,but when both me and the child raved about the ones we tried at the partner place, baby cakes, he ordered them. we both did, and as usual, phenomenal.
Also, we both never eat just sweet things for brrfst, so he ordered country fried steak and eggs w/ hash browns and coffee, I ordered bacon/eggs/hash browns with coffee. I usually won't order something like country fried steak unless a place is known for it, but after I tastes his, i was sad i didn't order that. Mine was good, but his was awesome.
So round two (we've been twice in 2 wks-bought groupon NOW deals both times)-this time i got the special-orange creamsicle pancakes with corn beef hash (another thing I typically won't order unless they're known for it)...hubby got an omelet with red velvets again :)
My pancakes=TDF. they tasted like those pillsbury rolls in a can you twist to pop open then cook in the over...comes with a orangey frosting? these taste like those!!!! 
My corn beef hash,sadly was eh. whatever i just won't order it next time!

Btw-this place has a bit of an island theme to it-they serve kahlua pork, side of steamed rice as substitute for toast, potatoes, etc, and various other islandy things.
If you dig breakfast joints, don't miss this one, or its counterpart baby cakes. they are both on buffalo, just one north and one south!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. The service could've been better and the pancakes were on the dense side. I ordered the Adobo fried rice since I'm Filipino and it was okay. It came wrapped in an omelet. The place was super busy and food came out fast! I would definitely comeback to try other things on the large menu :)."}
{"text":"I came in this morning hoping to have a lovely breakfast with my two friends, but sadly I was disappointed. I wasn't very hungry, so I requested a item off the kids menu. The server rudely told me, \"you can't eat that you aren't under 12\". When I told her I was 12 she laughed at me and wouldn't serve me. I have never had a server refuse to give me the kids menu. I'm paying so I should be able to order what I want? So I had to order something else and I got the bacon pancakes. They sucked, extremely mediocre. So dry and even when I drenched it in syrup they still had no flavor. Literally the pancakes out of the box are better. The server was rude and the pancakes were terrible. I would give it zero stars but I have to at least give one in order to post this. Never coming back. I don't recommend this to anyone. Sad to say that IHOP is better"}
{"text":"This place fucking blows. This is my third time here because my dumb friend likes the red velvet pancakes. Every time the food sucks, the service sucks, and I'm just pissed. Everything was unseasoned and my hash browns were undercooked. My eggs, hash browns, and sausage tasted literally all the same. Not to mention my glass was empty the entire duration of my meal. And they couldn't even clear the trash off the table. How hard is it to wait on a table when you are a WAITER."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and prices are good.  Restaurant is a little small, though.

Definitely worth a visit for breakfast.  I'd most likely go here before an IHOP or Denny's.  Their cookie butter french toast is my favorite."}
{"text":"The pancakes where hard and the butter wasn't soft! It's ok but I wouldn't go here again..."}
{"text":"I don't have to say anything other then...red velvet pancakes!!! Pumpkin in season!!!! No need to order anything else!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is great!! Food is even better!! I got the red velvet pancakes and a skillet. The food is great!!! Took my family here that is visiting and everybody was happy!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot. 
Best pancakes, red velvet are my favorite! 
My family and I come here often. In fact I had breakfast here one time per week my entire pregnancy."}
{"text":"I have not loved a place more than I love this place. It is a small restaurant so keep in mind there might be a wait but it is worth it. 

It is Hawaiian food and most people that work there are from the island. I had the moco loco with chili sub sausage instead of patty with garlic rice and as the waitress said it was \"fire\" 

The flavors were amazing and chili is from hawaii, i have had dreams about this breakfast since leaving and think I am craving more. 

We also ordered an omlete which was tasty added avocado. 

now lets talk pancakes! Now I am all about pancakes and I got the smores but cant wait to go back and try rocky road. We also ordered strawberry pancakes which were delightful. 

To top it off (no pun intended) the service here feels like home. They were always topping off the coffee, making sure we were taking care and the servers represented everything hospitality. The price point was amazing. 

I could not rave more about a place because there has been no place that has made me as excited. I did a happy dance multiple times during my meal."}
{"text":"I love going off The Strip to eat when I'm in Vegas. We found Baby Stacks on Yelp and it was about a 15 min drive from our hotel. On a Sunday morning, the wait time 30-40 min was pretty standard.

The place was small and packed full of people which was a great sign! We were seated at the bar and impressed by the variety of pancakes. They sounded more like different pies or cheesecakes.

One dish caught my eye: homemade corned beef hash + eggs + rice + pancakes! Ii wasn't a fan of their homemade version because it didn't have enough potatoes and wasn't cooked enough, so it felt like dog food. I think I would have preferred the canned corned beef hash.

My sister got the Spam version. We had to. YOLO.

The rice was a nice touch to breakfast. Reminded me of being at home. I wasn't too impressed by the pancakes, my sister got carrot cake and cinnabun pancakes. They were a tad too sweet for my taste and also I prefer a fluffier pancake.

Overall, this was a cute place. Service was friendly and you can tell this place is a hit with the locals and tourists."}
{"text":"On the plus side: the coffee was very good and they tried to seat us away from air conditioning vents. The place was freezing. 

Everything else: not so much.  One order of biscuits and gravy. Gravy was not  hot and had nothing in it but way way too much salt. \"Biscuits\" were more like dumplings in that they were not cooked thru so that they were doughy.

I ordered the fall special: pumpkin pancakes. They came with a huge dollop of whipped cream and something yellowish that was way too sweet. Glad I only ate one. Within the hour, I was rushing for the \"facilities\".  Hmmm. Guess we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have traveled to a far and distant place, I've been here before and it's so right. I know it's worth it. I've been dreaming of this place, carefully planning for this place. I am, off diet. Red velvet pancakes you are my happy place. This is a semi chain of mom and pop places and this one is my closest one. Breakfast is solid, country Benedict is crave worthy, with a delicate biscuit that is oh so fresh. I really like the Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice, it's like an omelet filled with meaty chicken and yummy fried rice. Their homemade red and green salsa is not to be missed. Those. Pancakes. Though. Go get some of those and work out tomorrow, they are worth the sweat. Shout out to Danielle, the sweetest waitress ever! Hey girl. Xoxo"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I 100% recommend the Orange Creamsicle pancakes if you're looking for a fun exciting flavor. It's my favorite and I order it all the time. If you're worried about how their savory breakfasts taste, don't be. It's the perfect place to go. Workers are nice, food is delicious. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"It was incredible. The service was good and they got our food out fast. Even though it was busy, our server checked on use and made sure everything was good. 

I ordered orange creamsicle pancakes and they were amazing. They aren't dyed, it's all natural and you can see the orange zest inside. I have enough food for left overs after ordering an omelette with it. I would recommend this place for breakfast any day. It's a little crowded but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by the ridiculous wait times: we were told it would be 45 minutes, but we were seated in 15! Service is friendly and quick, but once they give you your bill make sure you head to the front to cash out- the servers don't do that part.

KAHLUA PORK BENEDICT: Didn't care for the cabbage, found the pork itself a little bland, but somehow all the flavors together really made a great dish. Wish the potatoes had just a touch more seasoning, but they were perfectly crisp.
HUNTINGTON SKILLET: Seasoned potatoes topped with over-easy eggs, bacon, cheese, pico de gallo, AND avocado?! It's a party in your mouth, no additional seasoning needed. 
WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES: These are so sweet, you wont even need the syrup. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish a short stack they were so sugary. Didn't detect any macadamia flavor or crunch, though.
GARLIC RICE: Love how fragrant this dish is! Smelled it cooking and had to have some, definitely tempted to upgrade to the adobo fried rice next visit.

The thing that really amazed me was that none of the food we received was unnecessarily greasy, a common issue with breakfast/diner food. If you want to come here, better to go early (before 10) or wait til lunch- the place really cleared out by 11:30AM. Really liked the friendly island-style service, want to come back for the Kahlua grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot, two of us ate and the food was fantastic.  Bannana Cream Pie pancakes (yes thats what they were),  were as fantastic as they sound,,,,it was bannannriffic.  Bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly and bacon was tasty.  

Definately not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for.   This is definately a place worth frequenting if you enjoy breakfast out."}
{"text":"This place is ill ran...I love the food but the service is sub par. I have done take out had food forgotten and had to go back. Food ordered and half the parties food came out 20 minutes after the other orders. The icing on the cake was today put our name in and waited forever!!!! After being told it was 15-20 minutes we sat and watched every person who came after us get seated. Wow! Even asked the guy if he wrote my name down wrong...nope...after third party after us was seated I told him to take our name off we were done. I will never eat their again. Absolutely frustrating"}
{"text":"Presentation is a 5.  But I can't taste presentation, so I'm giving this a 3.  

Banana creme pancakes looked incredible as they were served to us.  Bananas, whipped creme, drizzle of some kind of brown stuff on top..yummy!   But taking one bite, I was confused.  The toppings and the pancake didn't work together and the pancake definitely lacked a punch.  I've had great banana pancakes (Bruddah's in Gardena, CA) but these were kind of disappointing.

Blueberry pancakes - same batter as the other pancakes with some blueberries pushed inside and topped with fresh blueberries as well.  Kid will devour anything with blueberries so she like them but once again, the pancake doesn't deliver.  (Stacks in Dana Point, CA - now thats a blueberry pancake!)

Chili skillet - this was very tasty but I wish it had more chili.  One more scoop of that delicious chili would have made me much happier.  I wish the potatoes were swimming in that stuff!  Combine that with a sunny side egg... ono.

Cornbeef hash - this was ok.  Just a plain ground cornbeef hash patty with rice and eggs.  Not too spicy but could have been burned just a little bit longer on the skillet.

Service was good and seating was faster than quoted.  Also noticed the tables were promptly cleaned after someone leaves.  Kind of far but its a decent alternative to an expensive weekend brunch on the strip."}
{"text":"I drove off of the strip to try this place & see what the hype was about. It's a small place. They told us that the wait would be about 40 min for a table. It turned out to be more like 50 min & we were there later -- maybe around noon. The waitress was cold and to the point. There was no \"where you guys from\" or anything like that. I had the banana foster pancakes (not listed on their menu). It was an upgrade to the 2 egg breakfast with potatoes. Two pancakes with cinnamon & caramel sauce and bananas. I asked for no whip cream. The pancakes were good. The other people at my table didn't like theirs as much (red velvet & s'mores -- was dry). If you're ok with the wait, then maybe visit them."}
{"text":"I've never been seated right away, but It is worth every minute of waiting. This place is ALWAYS packed because their food is AMAZING! Definitely feeds the soul. I love the Ma & Pop feel to this place, you're treated like family here. Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and not to my surprise, it was packed. The hostess said that the wait would be up to 1 hour, but I was willing to tough it out. Being the lover of red velvet cupcakes that I am, I wanted to try out the red velvet pancakes that everyone was raving about to see if it really was that great.

Ladies and gents, the red velvet pancakes were better than just good. They were INCREDIBLY delicious! Every bite was like a fluffy piece of heaven. The last time I had red velvet pancakes was in LA and it was too overly sweet, but Babycakes did a great job of bringing out the flavor of red velvet without making it too sweet. The melted mini chocolate chips added a nice touch to the pancakes. The best part about it was the cream cheese syrup. It added a sweet touch to the pancakes and made it the perfect combo. 

I tried the eggs benedict here as well, and it was definitely one of the better ones I've had as well. The eggs were cooked just right, and I barely tasted the yoke that oozed out from the middle. Note: I dislike the taste of yoke, and prefer egg whites, so I rarely order eggs benedict. But the eggs benedict I tried here was delicious. It came with a side of hashbrowns, and those were crispy and yummy as well. 

Out waitress was attentive and great, parking space is ample, and I will definitely be returning again the next time I'm in town =)"}
{"text":"My hubby loved the red velvet cakes and I had the bananas foster cakes which were awesome. Quick, speedy and friendly service."}
{"text":"Oh Em Gee. The red velvet and s'mores pancakes are so freakin' good.

Delicious food, large portions, good prices, and great service.

Babycakes is a must if you're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I love Babystacks!! The food is awwwwwwwesome and the service is terrific! Sometimes there is long wait on a busy day but it's worth the wait. I live in the area and waited along time for Baystacks and I'm exstremely happy they've arrived!!The restaurant itself is vibrantly decorated and gives a very positive environment to eat in If you're feeling hungry for breakfast, you can't miss on Indulging at Babystacks"}
{"text":"Ambience = Meh
Cost = Ok
Food = Decent
Busyness = On Steroids!
Service = Nothing special, but they are pushing you out the door... Keeping the flow going
Overall = May try again 

Maybe I didn't try the most popular items, bacon, eggs, hash-browns, buttermilk pancakes, these items were all okay. Nothing I would rave about. Definitely, a good price for what you are served. I would avoid sitting right around the corner from the entry, traffic there is a beast!!"}
{"text":"Service was great but I had some issues. They brought me toast that was completely burned and presented it to me flipped over with the not burned side showing... Like someone wouldn't notice. Not sure if I'll be coming back. Wasn't bad, wasn't great."}
{"text":"I was actually disappointed by this place after hearing great things about it from friends. The waiter was...different and really unfriendly. He didn't smile once. The food was okay. I had a scrambler sort of thing with a side of pancakes. The pancakes were very good though. Disappointed they had no gluten free pancake options. My mother-in-laws fruit came out spoiled and even when we asked they didn't take it off our bill. Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Babystacks is the best breakfast establishment in all of Las Vegas. The chicken fried steak is one of the best I've had in 20 years being in Las Vegas and the seasoned potatoes were very tasty. The cowboy skillet is awesome!"}
{"text":"Don't try to order pickup. I called was placed on hold, then hung up on. the 4 times I called back guess what the line was busy. Beyond annoyed. 

i had to go in to the store and have my order taken at that time. the food was good but too much hasle. it was extremely busy."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people have been talking about this place; but it didn't exactly live up to the hype. I love breakfast food and pancakes are my número uno. Unfortunately the short stack of pancakes I had was slightly overcooked and the inside was undercooked. The saving grace for the breakfast was definitely the omelet and hash browns; amazingly good! The customer service was pretty good; enough to make me want to give them another try."}
{"text":"The worst biscuits & gravy I have ever had biscuits had to be cut with a knife they were so stale and not very hot,gravy was good.Good bye never to return."}
{"text":"Food was good. It was pretty crowded, but we eventually got a seat and ate. Average breakfast place with nice portions. Can't complain"}
{"text":"Amazing food,amazing service Jaclyn was great. Best restaurant experience in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Yes, it is true. You may have to wait before you get a table, but aren't all good things worth waiting for?!

This review is years overdue. I'm not even a big fan of pancakes. However, I am a huge fan of creativity, and I definitely appreciate how they've married many desserts with classic pancakes.

Red Velvet Pancakes // WHAT?! Okay. I do have to admit that I have tried other better similar concoctions (i.e. red velvet waffles at Larchmont in LA and red velvet pancakes at the Grand Lux in the Venetian), but I was first introduced to these here at BabyStacks... so I have fond memories of this item!

Cookies n Cream Pancakes // I tried these babies for the first time today.  So good! I'm an Oreo lover, so I'm surprised I haven't tried these. I would definitely go for these rather than the Red Velvet from now on. I haven't seen these anywhere else before!

Biscuit & Gravy, Loco Moco, and Kalua Pork Benedict are some of the other items I've tried. Honestly, I wouldn't order any of those items again.

The pancake selection is awesome, but the pancakes themselves could use a little more fluffy... Still, a must-visit when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It's all about the spam sliders,best crepes and pancakes in town. Hands down my favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Expect a long wait but it's so worth it! We had the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage and Loco Moco. Both were delicious! Also had the lemon ricotta pancakes which broke da mouth! So ono!!!"}
{"text":"Best service and dining experience ever! Today, a friend and I had brunch at Babystacks. I've been a couple of times, and this was her first experience. Our server was quick, cheerful, and beyond helpful. He made menu recommendations that we're spot on and even brought us a sample of the macaroni salad to help us make up our minds about what we wanted for side dishes.

Of course, the food was excellent. I had loco moco with Kahlua pork, and she had the special fried rice. It was great food and a great experience. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"No wait and fast service and they are on top of it! Ordered the biscuits and gravy and the gravy was on the sweet side for me and the biscuits weren't the greatest. Also got the loco moco and again nothing special. Maybe we'll try the pancakes next time."}
{"text":"Haven't been let down yet. Only complaint is the wait, but I guess that's what happens when you're that good. Once you're seated it's fantastic. I recommend the go-to Red Velvet pancakes if you like sweet stuff."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time for a late breakfast in Vegas and it was very good. Tried the bacon pancakes and velvet. Both very good. Also had the Portuguese sausage, very tasteful! Can't wait to try out more of their cakes the next time in town. Great service too, got there 30min before they closed and they still served without issues."}
{"text":"I usually only order to go since it's across the street from me, but the young man who's always working togos is so kind and always remembers me and the little things I add to my order! He has such nice manners and makes picking up my breakfast a pleasant experience :)
I have ate inside before as well, and it is small since it's a cafe but it is full of good energy and the servers are very attentive (no matter how busy it is) and nice! 
We always order the Huntington skillet with a side of red velvet potatoes, a side of pico, and an orange juice. Super simple breakfast but it beats my homemade breakfast any day lol. This place is delicious!"}
{"text":"Would you believe that we only waited 20 minutes because its 8am lol? Last time we called this place the wait was 1.5 hours.

Tried their Portuguese sausage with garlic fried rice and it was good. Very tasty. Had to try the red velvet pancake but was not impressed at all. i don't know what all the hype is about. My daughter had Banana foster pancake and that was delicious. Hubby had the adobo rice which i'm glad I didn't order because I didn't like it.

Would come back again for the Banana foster pancake and portuguese sausage:)

Small place, always packed, lots of parking and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've been here 3, maybe 4 times. Each time with regret. I always go for their pancakes because that's what I would assume they're popular for. I've tried various ones and I must say  I was impressed with none and disappointed in all. They are consistent on being dry that no amount of syrup can fix.

I've also tried their biscuits and gravy. Also unimpressive. My husband has tried their country fried steak and loco moco and a few other items and also agrees this place is highly overrated."}
{"text":"Being from the Hawaiian Islands, it's no wonder I enjoy BabyStacks Cafe. Warm, comforting, just looking at the menu reminds me of home!

I've eaten at this location recently a few times and I've left feeling happy and full. I really enjoy cafes that only serve breakfast and/or brunch like this one, because they do it right! 

If you've ever been to Hawaii and miss those nostalgic eats, like spam, Portuguese sausage, eggs, & rice, Kalua pig Benedict, or some fluffy white-chocolate macadamia nut pancakes, you've found your place that serves all that and more. I haven't tried some of their more creative creations, like their Spam Scramble. Spam, eggs, rice, furikake, with homemade macaroni salad?! Or the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice or classic Loco Moco? It all sounds ono, doesn't it? They also offer omelettes, skillets, burgers, and even Zippy's Chili! If that wasn't enough, their pancakes or babystacks as they call them, are delicious! Classic toppings like blueberry and buttermilk, but their unique flavors like Orange Dreamsicle, rocky road, PB&J, S'mores, Carrot Cake, Banana Cream, even Bacon pancakes are sure to catch your eye. They are most known for their Red Velvet, however the rest of the selections sound just as delicious, I think. Recently, we tried the Cinnabun and Hazelnut w/ Nutella. Light, fluffy, and delicious, as pancakes should be! Their garlic rice, which are sautéed with onions are amazing, which many people substitute for the plain steamed white rice. 

Another thing I love is the way BabyStacks lets you substitute anything, some for a small up charge. Garlic rice? Egg whites only? Lemon Ricotta pancakes instead of regular buttermilk? I appreciate restaurants like this that'll make your breakfast the way you want it! And the prices are very reasonable. Their highest priced item I saw was $11.95, and that's for a full breakfast entree, which you get a big portion of meat accompanied with rice or potatoes AND pancakes or toast. 


I've had great service on each of my visits. Waters filled, food delivery fast, and servers are friendly and helpful. 

Honestly, the only thing that makes this place less than 5 stars is probably the wait to be seated. I've been lucky not to have waited very long, but my servers told me there's certain weekdays that can go an hour wait for a table. See...the food must be good!

Check it out if you haven't already...and go hungry!"}
{"text":"Space:
There were about 20 tables here but you couldn't fit a huge party. It is an averaged sized restaurant.

Service:
They are so friendly. I ordered take out and although it was some wait, they kept checking up on us and showed us our order before giving it to us. 

Price:
Their breakfast wasn't too cheap. But you can add/change items per request. 

Food: 
Their red velvet pancakes are super popular so I upgraded one of my omelets to try it. It was really sweet but I really liked it. My hash browns weren't crispy and you can tell they could've been cooked more. Besides that, their food was pretty average."}
{"text":"We went there for thanksgiving breakfast. People working in Babystacks are really really kind and welcoming but the omelettes are not big deal.."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a work thing, never even heard of it.  But wow!  Their shortstack of pancakes (any of them, we had them all) were amazing.  I had the blueberry pancakes, ham, and eggs.  We all basically shared their shortstacks.  They specialize in the red velvet pancakes for a reason...so good!  They also have bacon pancakes...so good!  Their coffee was...so good!

Definitely worth a go!"}
{"text":"OK, not thrilled average at best. Somewhat small portions and small premises. Good but faked service.  Would have preferred Dennys"}
{"text":"Delicious, as per usual. I love the variety of eggs benedict offered and how you can add your favorite pancake to any order! Hazelnut pancakes are a must! Nutella makes everything better....right? The staff is always helpful and friendly as well. They treat you like family. :)

My only complaint, my boyfriend got the kahlua pork grilled cheese - it was more like a kahlua pork sandwich with a little cheese added, and the chess wasn't melted."}
{"text":"The food was good, not amazing (as described by other patrons.) The service wasn't great but good. I don't care for how the food comes out whenever the dish is ready versus the entire order for the table brought out at once. This was our first visit so we ordered things that were seemingly popular. I don't have to have it but I will visit again. Maybe something on the menu will be \"amazing\"."}
{"text":"Love this place good food and great prices be ready to wait a bit.But you will find out worth it.pancakes are the bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent from the service to the food. I ordered the two eggs and turkey bacon with a side of avocado. Trying to keep it a little healthy but also was able to try the honey wheat short stack. The whole meal was great, eggs cooked perfect, avocado fresh, bacon crisp. The pancakes were some of the best I ever tasted, fresh and moist. The syrup was soak right up- could have eaten even more! The staff was attentive, quick and nice. Even provided me milk for coffee over cream. Patrons kept coming in hugging the staff made you feel that this is a place that you want to come back to. Highly recommend, I will be back with friends."}
{"text":"It was good.

I ordered the banana cream pancakes and eggs and potatoes.  It was good, I wish the place had booths but sometimes a harder chair is better for my back, it just depends.

I didnt really see what the hype was all about though, I have heard so much about the place that I expected something amazing and to me it was just a place to have breakfast.   

we will be back though."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the red velvet pancakes.  It was good; the rest of the food was merely okay.  I got the two-egg combo, with pancakes (a $1.50 upcharge for red) and hash browns.  The interior is kind of small and cramped (I had to sit under the waitress's stand, which was awkward), so it's not really good for big crowds.  I'd come here more often if it wasn't so far away..."}
{"text":"Best red velvet pancakes in town!!!
And best loco mocos!!
Good service ! 
Huge selection of pancakes"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place I've ever been to! Be prepared for long wait times but this place is SO worth it!

First off their food is like American/Filipino infused. We LOVED their adobo omelette! They also have the best plates for the sweet toothed with a whole variety of flavors to die for like red velvet pancakes, s'mores pancakes, etc the list goes on. 

Best thing I've ever had in my life though? The COOKIE BUTTER FRENCH TOAST!!! Get it and you can die happy I assure you."}
{"text":"I've tried the hash and chicken fried steak...and recommend the steak. You can actually get extra gravy if you want it. I just order the eggs (poached), garlic rice and pancakes in 3 separate boxes to go, as the steak is plenty for one meal. Later I mix the rice and eggs to make fried rice, maybe with oyster sauce and even more fried onion. One pancake is a quick meal, so that makes 4 in all. I won't be going for the sweet stuff, but this one dish is all I need. Best CF steak I've found here..."}
{"text":"Loved this breakfast and brunch place!  

FOOD:

I ordered the banana cream short stack and mmmm it was so delicious. I got this instead of the regular banana stack because I enjoy having fruit inside my pancakes, not just on top. I am so happy I got this. The custard and whipped cream that they drizzle on top went perfectly with my pancakes. I didn't even need syrup. 

SERVICE:

I'm a picky and very indecisive eater but my server was very patient and answered all my questions. He didn't rush me nor did he look annoyed (even though he might have been). :-)

INTERIOR:

Cafe looking set up. Very casual ambience. They have a tv in the corner where they played the World Cup. My boyfriend really enjoyed that."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have to start off by admitting that I'm not a pancakes fan - I'll go for waffles or French toast any day. The food at Babystacks absolutely blew my mind, though, and I regret nothing. 

I went with the Spinach Benedict as my main item and grabbed a short stack of their special tiramisu pancakes is my side... the portions are generous, the food is delicious and they're probably going to have to grease me to get my ass back out the door after the amount I've eaten. 

I'll be back whenever I'm in Vegas, definitely."}
{"text":"I heard nothing but good things about this spot from my Las Vegas family, so I decided to try it out.  There were 6 of us.  Upon walking in the door, the hostess just kind of looked up and I had to initiate conversation. Ok, fine I wont judge the restaurant based on her. She did warm up when I was paying, but who doesn't like money? Now on to the most important part: the food! I had spam, eggs, and rice with furikake. Pretty standard, can't screw that up. It was good, nothing to write home about. But what I will rave about are the Cinnabun pancakes! Wow! It still doesnt beat my favorite banana brown sugar at Hash house, but these are also amazing.  My Dad had the Banana Cream Pie pancakes and those were also delicious, but I like cinnamon so I preferred my own.  This place is pretty solid, and the locals think so too cause this place was packed on a weekday! I would eat here again, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Always come when visiting Vegas and now we are pretty good with figuring out when is the best time to come without having to wait too long. Can't go wrong with the adobo fried rice and extra charge for specialty pancakes. All pancakes have a great taste, but many come with their toppings thrown on top, not mixed into the batter, so just be aware."}
{"text":"I live on the east side and some friends and I made the trek because we'd heard good things and coupled it with another activity.  

Service was great and food was good.  But basically my bananas foster pancakes were dessert served for brunch.  They were good and I cleaned my plate of the small portion, but if they were around the corner from me I am not sure they would make the regular spot list.  This place was good, but I felt a little over-hyped.  The regular breakfast entrees (non-dessert ones, lol) didn't look any more fan fare than any other \"good\" breakfast.  I was not drooling over anyone else's plate, that is.  

My main purpose in review was for anyone making the trek and being underwhelmed.  I would eat there again and it was good, but not a destination or must try."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place seeing as I work at a breakfast/lunch restaurant as well. Our server first got our drinks and then immediately asked if we were ready to order. Seeing as we have never been here before and we'd looked at the menu for 30 seconds we obviously needed more time. He had come back 2 more times (both about less than a minute apart) before we finally figured out what we wanted. The whole time our server wasn't personable or anything. I felt like I was talking to a robot.
Now onto the food... I got the honey French toast which was really good! I also loved the sausage patty. However, the hash browns were cooked only on one side. The rest was completely raw. My mom got the Cinnabon pancakes which she claimed to be good but she's had better. My sister enjoyed her s'mores pancakes, but wished it came with more syrup. I don't know if it's because they ran out of the containers to put syrup in but they came in little to go cups. They gave us the bare minimum. We would have asked for more but our server seemed in a rush to leave our table when he checked up on us.
We did receive a discount, which was not explained. I'm assuming it's because he overheard us discussing the raw hash browns.
Also I don't understand why there were 4 hosts standing at the front. They didn't have much to do so I think 1 would have been fine with the 15 minute wait we had."}
{"text":"Whenever you're in the mood for DELICIOUS pancakes, this is the spot!! 
I always order something new and it never disappoints. 
This time I went with the Loco Moco: pretty much rice, hamburger patty topped with an egg + gravy. Upgraded my side of pancakes to Hazelnut and it was amazing.
The portions are great, the service is always friendly for how busy it gets. And yes, depending on the time/day you'll have a wait time. Just make sure everyone from the party is there or else they won't seat you. 
Since the restaurant itself is small, it can get pretty noisy. I always find myself coming back to try more amazing things. 

Would recommend the Adobo rice, too :))"}
{"text":"I've heard of this place from friends and I gave it a try. When I first entered, it took awhile to be seated since it's pretty packed for a breakfast joint. The servers were friendly. 

It's budget friendly and quick. One of my favorite breakfast place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"They have some good pancakes. Red Velvet and Tres Leche are my favorite. I do enjoy their loco moco but that's it. All their other food options are on the bland side. I've tried their omelettes, chili, sandwiches, hoping for another Favorite but I haven't found it yet."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! Had a skillet and the red velvet pancakes, and was awesome... Hands down... If you are in Las Vegas, DONT waste your money on the strip. Take the short drive to this place."}
{"text":"What a disappointment...waited forever for this place to open and when we walked in we weren't greeted they didn't seem friendly.  Sat down and as I look down the kitchen hallway there's a chef picking his nose  that was so gross we all walked out. He was digging so far up to itch his brain it seems. Never returning."}
{"text":"I had never heard about this place till a family friend had posted a picture of their red velvet pancakes and cream cheese syrup! Who would have thought of such a thing?! Babycakes did and I had to try them with a quickness! 

I've been here twice already. The first time was with a girlfriend of mine. We were seated immediately, but then again, we came on a Monday morning. Of course, I had to order the red velvet pancakes... and I was not at all disappointed! They were done just right... fluffy, not too sweet, and the cream cheese syrup was the icing on the cake... well, the syrup on the pancake! :P They were so delicious and very filling. I only got the half stack (3 pancakes), but that was more than enough. My friend got the kalua pig benedict and she said it was spot on. I had a little bite and from what I tasted... it was good, but I was just so into my pancakes! 

The second time was just a few weeks ago when my brother & sister were in town. The three of us and the bf came on a Saturday morning and waited about 40 minutes, but we knew to expect that and I told them it was worth the wait (since none of them had ever been here before). I, again, got the pancakes (but as a side, which is only two... enough to get my fix) with the bacon & egg breakfast. The bf got the kalua pig benedict with a side of Portuguese sausage. My brother ordered an omelet with some garlic fried rice and my sister had the spinach/mushroom/bacon benedict. Everyone was quite pleased with what they ordered. They all liked it so much, that my siblings want to come again the next time they're here and the bf really wants to try some of their other items. 

The food is great, their prices are reasonable, and their staff is super friendly. I live on the SW end of town, but will continue to make the drive out there to get my pancakes! Hope that you all open another location soon... maybe on this side! :)"}
{"text":"A must try spot! It can get very crowded, so either come super early for breakfast, or be prepared for a wait! I come for the adobo fried rice! It's my favorite! Pulled meat and rice all covered in omelette style eggs with a side! I love the crispy potatoes! Salty savory goodness! 
They also have a HUGE selection of what I call fancy pancakes! The pancakes alone are a special experience!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to choose between nutella crepes, cookie butter french toast and spam scramble!"}
{"text":"Breakfast served with a side of Aloha. A locals favorite, with other locations around town. 

This is one of those restaurants where it really doesn't matter what you choose, everything on the menu is equally delicious. Even if you're not too big on pancakes, you're gonna love these. Unique flavor combinations and the fluffiest stacks you've ever tasted. Short stack or full stack if you're really hungry, topped with whatever your little heart desires. Bananas Foster are my favorite. Red Velvet are also a big hit. Also, I'd skip the skillets if you like your potatoes crispy (I know I do). 
But when I'm not in the mood for pancakes I opt for the Portuguese Sausage & Egg Whites and Seasoned Potatoes or The Huntington (a bacon omelet topped with avocado served with a side of pico). Other notable mentions: Spam and Eggs with Garlic Fried Rice, Adobo Fried Rice & Portuguese Fried Rice. Rice, Rice Baby! Lol. 

Tips: 
Lots of parking, but this is a smaller location. Come early of you don't want to get stuck waiting on the sunny bench. They won't seat your party until everyone has arrived."}
{"text":"Little known fact, there are very few things I love more than breakfast. So for obvious reasons it was on the top of my very long list bookmarks. A word to the wise, come early and come hungry! There will be a wait but it's worth it. Better than the cracked egg, the egg & I, egg works...basically anyplace with the word egg in it. Lol! (IMO anyway) :p 

Friendly staff and lots of Hawaiian inspired dishes. I just love the aloha vibe here which makes sense since Vegas is the 9th island. Zippy's chili (If you've been to HI before then you already know what I'm taking about), portuguese sausage with garlic rice, macadamia pancakes, spam & eggs, adobo fried rice omelette, and the list goes on. It's easy to see why baby stacks stands out from the pack. So Ono! 

Another notable mention are the red velvet pancakes. But my all time favorite are the bananas foster pancakes. OMG!!! Ahhh-mazing!"}

{"text":"Been coming to Babystackes on Flamingo and Buffalo for years, always had great servives and good food. Today I order take out, call my order in they said it will ready within 10 to 15 minutes no problem came in pick up my order the host forgot to ask me about my side dishes so I had to wait for another 10 minutes for my hash brown and pancakes to get cook. And the meantime I ask for extra cream cheese syrup was told it will cost me 75 cent more. First I thinking the host forgot to ask me about side dishes which is her responsibility when taking my order over phone. I not worry about the 75 cent. I ask to speak to a manager she was very rude. I let her know my order is not completed I have to wait for ten extra minutes for my food. The manager didn't say much but you have to pay the 75 cent. Bad management a least here me out. To top it off the hash brown I waiting on was raw the omlet I order no cheese. I know by me not going back there will not hurt their business, but if they keep with this type of customer service it will be a matter time before it goes under."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had a ton of staff but never got what I wanted. Never got my daughters drink, no refills and even asked for crayons on several occasions only to be ignored. Food is nothing special. Overrated. Not happy with our waitress."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in vegas! Best food, best service, best prices! My favorite is the Portuguese sausage and eggs with a side of orange dreamsicle pancakes!  I would go every weekend if I wasn't worried about getting chubby!!"}
{"text":"For breakfast, I generally lean towards pancakes and french toast, occasionally I would order egg benedict's... but rarely would I ever eat an omelet WITH RICE.

I ordered the Adobo Chicken Omelet, and boy it was amazing! Definitely did not expect that. Load it up with a bunch of Cholula or Tapatio sauce (it's not the same with Sriracha), and I could eat this multiple times a week. The egg was fluffy and the rice and chicken had great flavor, but adding the sauces totally takes it up a notch. 

And I couldn't pass up on the famous Red Velvet Pancakes, so I ordered a small stack as well. It was extremely fluffy, and tasted similar to Red Velvet... but not quite there. The cream cheese sauce definitely made this pancake one of the best pancakes ever. It provides a different kind of sweetness, and you don't need too much whereas with pancakes from Ihop, I generally have to smother it in syrup. 

I hear there can be a long wait sometimes; I was lucky enough to have gone on a weekday during lunch and waited only for a table to get cleaned up. Even if I had to wait... this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Food was great. They have a lot of different and unique breakfast selections. My daughter got some cookie dough French toast thing. Looked good."}
{"text":"Expect a bit of a wait, no matter what day or time you arrive for breakfast, brunch or lunch. This diner is popular with locals and tourists alike because their pancakes are da serious bomb and they have a globally-diverse menu.  It took us quite a while to make our decision as there were a number of menu options. If you're from the Islands of Hawaii, you'll enjoy the island spin on some of their offerings (the loco moco, Portuguese sausage, spam, rice, etc.).

This sunny morning prompted us to order Mexican huevos rancheros and Korean kalbi ribs with eggs and rice, with bottomless cups of steaming coffee.  Hubby remarked that the huevos rancheros were some of the best he's had over the years (and he's finicky about those)--he said the tortilla was crispy, carnitas well seasoned, eggs cooked perfectly and it all melded together into one tasty dish. The eggs on my kalbi dish were also prepped as ordered, the generous scoop of rice was topped with furikake seasoning and the kalbi had a nice easy  flavor, although a little too chewy for my jaws (dang that gristle). That still didn't deter me from finishing it. My dish came with a side of their short stack (which we upgraded to the scrumptious banana pancakes sprinkled with pecans). Lot of food for breakfast, but since it was the stick-to-your-ribs type of meal, it carried us through late afternoon before we were hungry again.

I'd been wanting to try this location and it sure delivered with tasty food and good, attentive service."}
{"text":"First time at this location a few days ago. I give this place 1 star because the waiter was nice. The host/cashier ( young spiked hair kid ) TERRIBLE customer service! Walked in and no hello, hi, welcome.... Just stared at us chewing his gum like he hated being there lol. Got seated ordered adobo fried rice with red velvet pancakes. Pancakes were good till I found a white hair in my food! Yuk! Appetite ruined! Told the waiter about the hair and he said he'll comp one of the meals but when I got the check? It was still there but oh well. I didn't want to make a big fuss out of it since we'll never go back here. Went to pay and stood there in front of the TERRIBLE host/cashier and still no acknowledgement lol so I left the money on the counter and left. TERRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Frequent customers because of the food but their service is not the best. Weekends are busy!! The public knows this so you would think the company would better prepare, they obviously know it's going to happen too. Getting placed on the waitlist is the hardest part lol and I'm not the kind to say I arrived first but on more than 1 occasion I've walked in looking for the clipboard person and they are taking names from the 2-3 guests that have walked in after me already -_-"}
{"text":"We were in the area, so stopped in for breakfast. 

My wife ordered white chocolate pancakes and I ordered an omelet and asked for well done hash browns with two pancakes.

My back was to the kitchen, but my wife saw our pancake orders sitting on the counter. Our waitress was standing nearby talking with another waitress, ignoring our order cooling. Finally my wife called over the waitress, asking if those were our pancakes. The waitress answered, \"yes would you like me to bring them over?\"   She delivered them and she needn't bothered. Mine pancakes were doughy and tasteless. Hers had the same exact pancakes with some chocolate chips tossed on top.  

My omelet came with underdone hash browns - forget my well done request. 

I had caffeinated coffee, and my wife had decaf which they signified with a paper under the cup. While we ate, she poured decaf in my caffeinated cup, and didn't fill my wife's cup. 

The food is bland, and the staff does not seem to care for their customers. Very bad combination!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the buzz here! and I will keep coming again and again when I visit!

U is for the unchangeable service and delicious food that is served here. This is my third time visiting for breakfast and every time the food quality and the type have been consistent. From the delicious red velvet pancakes to the adobo fried rice and the Portuguese sausage everything is yummy yummy yummy~

Z is the zealous breakfast fan when I am here. The pancakes are seriously divine and picture perfect every time I've been here! The red velvet IS the most popular but that doesn't mean that the other flavors offered aren't good. Where ever your sweet palate takes you go with it! They do have daily specials which are HIGHLY recommended! Though it's not the most manicured nor most appealing on the outside place to eat, DO NOT undermine the yummy possibilities offered here!

Z is for the zZZZz's you will get, the aftermath food coma from the delicious food! The portions here are again generous like the staff and a place to go again and again. 

Last BUZZ not least, parking is easy to find. Morning's are busy, so expect a 15-20 min wait to be seated. And always keep an out for their specials, cause they are definitely special and always a good idea!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes were really good. The cream cheese icing sauce made them too sweet in my book. I just dipped a few bites in the sauce. The whipped cream that came on top made them sweet enough. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I recommend you try it's like going to a sushi bar but for breakfast it's quality food at a great price"}
{"text":"Awesome Red Velvet pancakes! I ordered homemade corned need hash with eggs n seasoned potatoes n added 'upgrade' of red velvet pancakes! Very good! Tiny place but loved the Aloha vibes n grinds! My husbands from Honolulu n is going to freak when he here's about this place!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after checking Yelp reviews and it is worth the hype! The red velvet pancakes are to die for and the chili omelette was also very good. The restaurant is small so a wait is to be expected but ours was only about 15 minutes to be seated. Our server was very cheerful and friendly. This place is definitely worth a drive off the strip and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin!   This place is so adorable first of all and it just gets better.  The service was fantastic and the pancakes....ohhhh the pancakes = heaven!   I had the hazelnut pancakes which are drizzled with Nutella and have chopped hazelnuts on them and a huge dollop of the freshest whipped cream. Then I had them add strawberries...then I died and went to heaven from my first to my last bite!  Nobody should miss this place!  I will definitely return every trip!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 

I always order the two egg breakfast. It's cheap and it comes with hash browns and pancakes, which you can always upgrade to the delicious red velvet ones. :)"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my adult daughter's birthday. Sunday morning at 11 o'clock - the place was packed. The young woman at the front desk estimated we could be seated in about 25 minutes. I was incredulous. And I was wrong. They had us seated faster than that. The menu is incredible, with many very interesting crepes, pancakes, burritos, omelets, and even sandwiches. My wife and I decided to share a short stack of hazelnut pancakes and the cookie butter French toast. The French toast was amazing. It had cinnamon, cake crust crumbles, and Nutella drizzle all in one breakfast dish. YUM! If I had eaten the whole thing by myself, I would have gone into sugar shock. But it would have been worth it. Best French toast ever! By comparison, the pancakes were a disappointment. Yes, it had Nutella on top. It also had a huge mound of whipped cream. Even with the Nutella and the whipped cream, the pancakes were somewhat disappointing. Maybe if we didn't have the French toast to compare it to, it would have seemed better. My daughter had the breakfast burrito with a side of two chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes. She loved the whole thing. All of this delicious but decadent eating and no dish was over $10. Good food, reasonable prices, an excellent service. I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I love this spot... best breakfast around. Lolo Ricks Adobo Fried Rice dish is amazing...get the garlic rice with it tho."}
{"text":"Very impressed.  Excellent food.  Brought my family.  We had the regular buttermilk pancakes, Cinnabon and white chocolate pancakes.  Also, an omelette and chicken fried steak. All were excellent especially the gravy.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We ordered lots of stuff from the menu...Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, Garlic Rice with eggs and bacon, Red Velvet pancakes, and Mexican Skillet.  

The garlic rice was ok.  Kinda harsh garlic flavor.  The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were great.  It's thin and more like a thick crepe, but the sauce was awesome.  The red velvet pancakes were even better!!!  I would definitely come back for them.  The pancakes come with a cream cheese frosting that isn't too sweet.  Perfect."}
{"text":"I've seen so many drool worthy pics on IG. So I had to check this place out while we were in Vegas. It didn't disappoint. I got the make your own skillet. It was good but a bit small. The mocha pancakes were out of this world. And this is coming from someone who doesn't normally order pancakes. Chocolate pancakes with a slight coffee taste, chocolate syrup, almonds and whipped cream. It was so good!  My daughter got the Nutella crepes and they weren't great. Messy to eat and the Nutella was so thick it was just too much. My hubby got the chili loco moco. I was hesitant about that. But the chili is very tasty. I would order that next time. We had a great meal minus the nutella crepe. Will be going back. Be prepared to wait. The line was very long when we ate there."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast place! I always get hash browns and red velvet pancakes they're delicious! The service is usually outstanding and even though it's a busy place I never have to wait very long. They always keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Austin, our server, who took incredibly good care of us. I asked for a bunch of crazy requests (I'm pregnant and have a bunch of weird cravings!) he got me a side of pickles, extra furikake, made sure I was always taken care of... he was so awesome!!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this mom and pop style breakfast place, the crepes are awesome very large portions are a plus. The service is on the decline, you shouldn't have to wait 30 mins on your breakfast anywhere. My only other complaint is whenever I order my steak and eggs, despite my temperature request (medium rare) it comes out well done. This place other than these two issues is a great choice for the centennial community."}
{"text":"Crazy busy. Luckily there is usually room for one at the counter. Good food so I can see why they are so busy! Decent service. They do close early."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a short time.  Went to have a late breakfast with a friend while I was there so hit up this place.  I had heard about the red velvet pancakes, so I ordered those.  Ok, by far the best pancakes I have ever had.  they come with a cream cheese syrup.  They are amazing! Just ordered a short stack but with a side of bacon.  The bacon was a wonderfully smoked bacon.  Almost tasted like it was smoked like a good brisket.  Very good!  There was a bit of a wait since the restaurant is kind of on the small side. It is worth the wait.  The waitress and cashier were both very delightful and attentive.  Will have to go back and try the biscuits and gravy or something else."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the red velvet pancakes and the cream cheese syrup.  I also liked the kalua pig benedict."}
{"text":"I ordered the spam scramble and added the banana fosters pancakes, my goodness those pancakes were fantastic as was the scramble. My son ordered the Nutella crepes with strawberries which were amazing and my husband ordered an omelette, hash browns and buttermilk pancakes, again delicious. 
We had a short wait to be seated and service was fast and our waitress was lovely. 
The only reason I took a star off the review was due to the coffee which was barely warm and rather weak tasting. 
I would love to keep returning and eventually try all the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Can I just say this place is so awesome. My friends have talked about this place and I finally decide to try it out. This is the second time my family and I come here. The first time I ordered the adobo omelet and my husband ordered the piglet with a short stack of carrot cake pancakes. This time around we ordered the red velvet pancakes, rocky road pancakes, chicken tenders, and Nutella crepes with strawberries. The service was awesome both times, and especially today considering it being Mother's Day. The food even better!!!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is our go-to local breakfast spot! Everything is truly amazing - from their pancakes to their Hawaiian/Filipino inspired dishes. Some of our favs include the red velvet and cookies and cream pancakes, the mexican skillet, spam with garlic rice and the loco moco. While they're usually busy especially on weekend mornings it's so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, and prominent menu selection. The staff could be more enthusiastic, though."}
{"text":"Had this place a couple of days ago, I saw it one night leaving smiths and decided to look at the food pictures on here (lol)... And my family just HAD to go, especially that it's right around the corner.

My mom and her husband had omelets and buttermilk pancakes ... I on the other hand had the Huntington skillet with hazelnut pancakes and THEY WERE SO GOOD! Will def go back every time I visit my parents. I want to try everything!"}
{"text":"Crazy good food here, people, pure and simple.  Party of three of us played musical plates because we wanted to taste as many dishes as we could. Amazing, the eggs and the pancake dishes we tried were awesome. The red velvet looks like it would be too sweet, but was not.  Delicious. The bananas foster pancakes were a bit too sweet for us, but still delicious. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Never eat there again, first of all we were sat down and they have nothing on the windows so my boyfriend was literally blinded by the sun shining in because of the time of day. He made sure to ask the server if the corn beef and hash was homemade and he assured him it was. His food look like it came from a bag or was frozen. He told the server it wasn't good when he came to ask how everything was he asked my boyfriend what he'd like instead he asked for scrambled eggs and bacon. When the eggs came out they were not even cooked all the way so he said something and he told the sever he was done and didn't want anything at all, he brought him another set anyways. My food was ok except for the hash browns they were frozen in the middle, I didn't even bother to say anything because there was no reason at this point. Quality of the food is nothing special at all could have made 10x better food at home. We were very excited to try this place but our experience was very disappointing and will not being going back to this location or any other one. The employees were nice though."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and attentive.  I heard it gets pretty busy, but luckily we were there on a Monday morning around 8:30 AM, so it wasn't too bad.  Plenty of seats open.  You can tell it's Filipino owned by the decorations, hence the giant spoon and fork.

As for food, we ordered the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut pancakes and Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  The pancakes were pretty good.  I liked how they topped the pancakes with white chocolate chips, pretty tasty.  I wasn't too crazy about the adobo fried rice.  First of all, it didn't really taste like adobo, and second it was pretty salty.  

Maybe it was just an off day on the adobo fried rice?  Hopefully, but who knows.  I'll definitely be back to try some other things, though."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, the baby chic omelet is amazing!  They have a huge variety of pancakes as well!  I just wish they didn't run out of that delicious chili all the time!  It's sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I love Babystacks! Their food tastes great! I definitely recommend the Red Velvet pancakes. They're way better than the ones I had at IHOP. Also the Kalua Pig Benedict & the Adobo Fried Rice omelet are really good! They're usually pretty busy by the time I'm awake & thinking about eating here so a lot of the time I order Togo & it's just as good! The people that work here a super friendly & always have a smile on their face no matter how busy. Definitely will keep coming back to eat at Babystacks!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin pancakes were delicious!! BUT my friend ordered steak and eggs and I'm not quite sure it was steak...I wish I could have taken a picture. It was so gray and it looked like it wasn't even cooked correctly. It looked like a year old steak. I'm hoping he doesn't get sick.."}
{"text":"When we first got here the line was going outside of the door. There were about 6 people ahead of us and the seating area was full! It must be that good.

The setting looked alright very simple and clean. It gives you a warm Hawaiian feel because I am from the island of Oahu myself. 

The menu listed my favorite: CHILI MOCO and also some local favorites in there as well. I believe that I would rate the chili MOCO a 7 out of 10 because the plate looked too big for the portion. I think that there should be more flavor in the meat and provided a bigger portion of food.

Overall it was great but I would have wanted the portion a little bigger."}
{"text":"Slow service, fairly ignored by staff on what seemed like a less busy time before noon.  Eggs Benedict was over cooked, but the pork was tasty.  Kind of disappointed based on reviews I read.  Could have been worse, but could have been a MUCH better experience."}
{"text":"Holy mother of pearl!! If you're looking for amazing pancakes, look no further. My fiancé and I tried this place one morning and we were left in awe. I had the banana creme pie pancakes and she had the rocky road, and wow. They were both phenomenal! We also had an omelet, but could have been satisfied with JUST the pancakes. They were so fluffy, tasty, and just the right amount of sweet. Absolutely amazing. They have many flavors to choose from, and they all sounded great. Can't wait to get back and try some others! I saw they had seasonal flavors too! It's a cozy place, but you get your food quickly and it does not disappoint. Can't wait to get back here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. It is seriously my number one spot. It's always crowded which tells you how good it is. Never less than a 20 minute wait, unless you go super early, of course. I  had the spam and eggs the first time, so good. Then I discovered the chili moco, substitute spam. OH. MY GOD. It is the only thing I order now. It's that good. GET IT!! I love that you can also upgrade your side of pancakes to one of their Babystacks. I have had their blueberry, banana cream pie, red velvet, Cinnabon, and cookies and cream. Still working. My way through the rest lol. My must try Babystacks are for sure the Cinnabon and the cookies and cream. You don't even need  he side of syrup they send. Just delicious."}
{"text":"Based on these reviews, I'd say we went on a bad day.
We went on the Yelp! recommendation... so you guys, prove me wrong lol

The places was unreasonable crowded and packed in and was unbreakable loud.
The services was clumsy and slow.
Coffee... not too tasty.

The cakes were just okay, nothing exciting.
We'll try it again soon, maybe on a weekday."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting place, which has different tasting pancakes. The red velvet was whatevers, but the carrot cake was very unique and pretty good. I opted for the adobo fried rice omelet. It's not that bad."}
{"text":"I've been to different Baby Stacks locations and this one is unfortunately the worst by far.  I gave this location 3 try's and now I say no more.

The first experience the service was scattered from the time we walked in.  The hostess was confused our group wanted to dine in since they were on a 15 min wait. Once seated we had to stop a waiter to take our order and the food came out slightly warm.  Shit happens and everyone paid without complaining just laughing at the strange breakfast.

My next go at this place started with better service until it was time to eat. My girlfriend and I both ordered eggs benedict. We noticed my eggs were basically hard boiled, the yolk was completely cooked to the point I separated from the whites, whole.  When I asked the waiter he looked and said, \"that's how they are supposed to be.\" I then pointed to my girlfriends plate and asked why her's looked runny and benedict like. We asked to speak to the manager but received the check when the waiter returned. 

The hair that broke the egg... My last experience with this place came in the form of a to go order.  Figuring maybe the food would be better sans service.  The joke was on me... went for the omelette this time, figured it had to be a safe bet. At first glance the avocado, that of course was extra, was black. The first few bites of my avocadoless omelette were good. I had almost forgotten it didn't have the mean green avocado. Then it all went terribly wrong when I found hair imbedded in the middle of it all.  I'll let the photos tell the rest.  

Good luck to those that venture into this pile of wasted eggs."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for breakfast and brunch. Anything & everything here is delicious- seriously.. My faves are the adobo fried rice, all their eggs benedict- I've had them all and chili loco moco just to name a few. Their stacks pancakes are equally as good."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food! Amazing service! Just an overall favorite place to eat. Definitely something everyone should try!!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite breakfast place. Service is fast and their food is great, especially their corned beef hash. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So to start not a fan of having to wait to eat at the bar when there is obviously chairs open. Then it took about 45 minutes to get my food. I ordered the omelette with the pasilla chile in it and chicken; however I switched the chicken for thier pork carnitas. It was decent but definitely not as much flavor as I expected. Best part of the meal was the cute waitress with a nice smile."}
{"text":"I don't understand how the place was rated so high. The bacon was overcooked and their pancakes tasted mushy and dense. Also their water was salty (and so was the coffee). The restaurant was very small and crowded with rowdy tables. Thankfully, the service was great, but I will not come back."}
{"text":"So many different pancakes! I ordered bananas foster pancakes and they were delicious! The service was good too."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations and the service and food was great at both locations. I love the fact that they have Hawaiian favorites on the menu, such as spam, loco moco and Portuguese sausage. Arrive early cause it gets busy for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever! Efrain was excellent! I am glad he was our server! Last time I did not have a friendly one in the Centennial area. My wife and I are definitely  coming back :)"}
{"text":"came to babystacks because it offered so much variety! i had the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes, but i regret not getting the corned beef burrito or the adobo fried rice. my friend had the steak (cooked perfectly) and my dad had the regular breakfast with a side of garlic rice, which i devoured because i LOVE garlic rice!

will definitely stop by and try more when i can!"}
{"text":"Super breakfast! My husband and I split an omelette and it was plenty.  Our daughter got pancakes and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"I love going to this restaurant, but today it was very disappointing for them to tell their customer that there will be 10-20 minute wait but the dinning area is half empty. First family that's waiting without being greeted, left frustrated and then we follow after being inform that there's an additional 10-20 wait. Maybe we walked in with them being short staff, but we left this place and went straight to Metro Dinner..again this review has nothing to do with the food, never had an issue with the quality of food here always very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in today (Saturday) and it was slamming. We were seated quickly as well as attended to quickly by our server. We arrived at 8:40 am and by the time we got our drinks there was a line of people waiting to be seated.  Food was great and fast. I ordered a skillet with a tiramisu stack---delicious and filling! I only ate about 1/4 of it. My son was happy with his eggs, bacon, hash browns and stacks as well. Definitely returning :)"}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving for breakfast they wasnt that busy took our server a little more time to assist us the food is okay not as great as other restaurants she only check on us once never refill my water when it was time to pay a Mexican guy was cashing us out and wasnt really happen on the tip I give. If your going to give someone a bad attitude because of the tip you didn't like keep it to yourself. Tips are optional when you get good service. If your money is all you guys care about and not guest service then I hope you guys get more training for your employees"}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes. Weak coffee. Fast service once seated but we sat there for 20'minutes after finishing our meal before getting our check. They could have had our table a lot sooner if they wanted especially since the wait was 45 minutes to get in."}
{"text":"After being told by some coworkers that I should try this place. I went ahead and did that. We were seated immediately. There are so many options for your pancakes and everything looks delicious. I finally decided on the cookie butter French toast. It was good but nothing to brag about. I ordered some eggs, bacon and potatoes and they were all so good. Can't wait to go back and try the different items on the menu. I gave them 4 stars because there was an inconvenience regarding upgrading the French toast from regular to cookie butter filled. Either way the service was good."}
{"text":"Love the menu here! The option of spam as a breakfast meat reminds me of my childhood. The selection of pancakes and side items is a welcome departure from the norm. Wish the hours were longer, we sometimes get here too late!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here... This experience gave me the courage to write a review.

There is nothing special about this place. It's boring and bland; I had the corned beef hash and eggs. The corned beef is usually a salty dish but in this case again boring. The garlic rice is even worst! The onions aren't fully cooked and there's so much what's the point of even having rice just give me a onion to bite into. My other half got the loco moco.. Why does the gravy look like water.. Not to mention taste like it too. I really wanted to like this place because it's more reasonable on prices than the cracked egg. 

Oh well...

Did I forget to mention my server helped an 8 top ahead of my 2 people so we waited extra longer to eat and put in our order. 

Lovely."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! I've been there four times and it's been great every time. Servers are friendly. Pancakes are great, but !vorite by far is the Ranchero Skillet!! The green sauce is freshly made every morning. It's super flavorful and tangy, but not too spicy at all. Best breakfast!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is my favorite!
Eggs Benedict is always delicious. I love that they serve shredded hash browns when it seems like so many breakfast places go with ranch-style (cubed) potatoes. I order them crispy and haven't been disappointed. I've tried several of the fancy pancakes and liked all that I've tasted (red velvet, carrot cake, bacon, cinnabun, original, cookies and cream, and so on). My favorite is to upgrade to the banana foster short stack for \"dessert\" after my eggs. My husband is over the moon for the adobo fried rice omelet that is bursting with flavor and big enough to share. The coffee is pretty good and the service is pretty much spot on every time--friendly, gracious, helpful. Mmm, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came back here. It did not disappoint!  I got the juevos rancheros with a BabyStacks of cookies and cream. Oh man!  So good!  It was busy and the service was a little slow, but so worth it. Will come back."}
{"text":"First time here.  We didn't know what to expect, but were pleased with the fresh food and friendly staff.  It's a great quick stop when you need good food fast.  I would would come back for sure.  Only thing to change is that the eggs were closer to looking soft boiled then eggs Benedict should be.  Good clean atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The red velvet pancakes are the best and the avocado chicken burger is amazing also service is fantastic im hear once a week at least!"}
{"text":"I've tried just about everything on the package menu n I wasn't disappointed with anything. I really don't like super sweet syrups and toppings and although the photos make it look like it's gonna be a sugar overload I was surprised that it wasn't overwhelming at all. Just a perfect drizzle of toppings."}
{"text":"This place rocks best chocolate chip pancakes ever and best potatoes ever and the service was awesome this place deserves a commercial"}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  But the building faces the east so the sun beats into the restaurant. I'm really surprised owner hasn't put some blinds up for there loyal customers. As we have been coming here for many years. Our server's Monica & Jacob are awesome. Merry Christmas & a HAPPY NEW YEAR"}
{"text":"Our favorite pancake so far is their oreo cookie and banana foster pancakes! The red velvet..honestly, is not that great.. for me, it tasted like colored pancake.. I was expecting a chocolatey tasting one. Their whipped cream is so goooood! I forgot to task if it's homemade. We tried the lola's chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in so much egg.. I thought it was way too much egg. If I would make it, I would add more rice and less of the egg but probably they had to make it that way to be able to wrap the rice well. Service: Good customer service, friendly staff. Ambiance: Fair (uncoordinated decor) Price: $$
Food: Good! Huge serving. Sharing recommended."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! There were so many different  things to choose from. I was torn between getting a skillet and trying the banana cream pie pancakes! I didn't  want to overwhelm myself with too much food. So my sis got  a skillet dish and I got my pancakes.  Talk about pancakes so fluffy and full  of flavor. You don't  need syrup. To add syrup would have ruined the banana  cream experience!  My sis skillet dish was a chili omelet yes you read that right. An omelet  with chili in it plus hash browns. Nothing short of amazing!  Service was very polite here and the waiter was very attentive. Great place to go when you want a nice comforting breakfast!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food delicious! Danielle was awesome. If you don't mind a little wait, your tastebuds & tummy will thank you. My family will definitely be going back for more. I would recommend  the Portuguese Fried Rice if savory is was you crave or the banana foster pancakes."}
{"text":"We came to visit my mom in Las Vegas.  She never ventures much; creature of habit.  I looked up breakfast places and decided on BabyStacks Cafe.  BabyStacks did not disappoint!!  Fabulous little cafe with an amazing menu.  I ended up with the hazel cakes and biscuits and gravy. Everyone in our party loved their meal.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Loco Moco with the garlic rice was delicious. Husband had the Banana Foster pancakes which he left no evidence of on the plate....we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been eating here since they opened a few years ago in Henderson and have watched the size of their portions, food quality and customer service steadily decline. Pancakes are shrinking, portions of food and rice are shrinking, and every time we order takeout they get it wrong. 

Really sad because this place started out awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm such a chocolate lover! But I fell into a romantic entanglement with the orange cremesicle pancakes!!  The Loco moco is also a 8/10... I've been there multiple times over the past year is have to say i was  only disappointed in one dish which was a pork omelette that was bland. But luckily I had the orange cremesicle pancakes and it evened out my dining experience lol"}
{"text":"This has been a go-to breakfast place of our family BEFORE. But now it had changed, we'll NEVER go back again. We found a small cockroach in my husband's strawberry lemonade drink. Truly, the manager was apologetic, and that we appreciate. But what other flying of crawling objects might be in their kitchen?"}
{"text":"A couple of my friends and I were headed to Dennys on the strip when our Uber driver suggested Baby Stacks. I honestly thought it was closer to the strip but it was worth the $14 Uber.

Our server Jonathan was very attentive and friendly with a sense of humor so that was a plus. I ordered the banana pancakes (forgive me I'm not really much of a risk taker when it comes to pancakes) with turkey sausage and eggs with, get this, pepper jack cheese. I was surprised they even had pepper jack cheese so thats another bonus in my book :) I dont't know if my friends and I were just super hungry or they really were taking awhile but the food eventually came to the table. 

Im from Los Angeles and here we have a small restaurant chain called Pann's were the pancakes are just YUM! After visiting Baby Stacks I feel they need a new recipe lol. The turkey sausage was good along with the eggs. Although I'm not a huge egg fan i felt they could have shown a little more love (given me more eggs) for my side.

All in all my friends and I really enjoyed our breakfast. Next time I visit Vegas i will definitely return for breakfast."}
{"text":"First time here- did not disappoint! I was surprised how fast I got in here, and I'm glad since fasting and hungry !!Lots of options,  glad I looked to yelp for reviews! I tried the Huntington omelette as a skillet - bacon cheesy potatoes topped with eggs and avocado- with sides of pico and sour cream . Delicious! You also get pancakes! I tried the bacon pancakes- amazing !! You should try it!!!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food, sad their service is completely awful! First, a party of two has to wait to be seated after every party of 4 or 6 because the host doesn't want them to wait too long if she gives up too many 2 seats, they wait to push tables together to accommodate the parties that come after. So a wait time for a party of 2 is ridiculous when it should be vice versa. They messed up the order and was short with us when we asked to fix it. So sad, but when they always have a line no one will do anything about it."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just ok. My iced tea was weird, when I lifted my straw out, it had a stringy kind of slime from it? I didn't have anymore. I ordered the huevos rancheros with red sauce. They delivered it with green. Everything was under seasoned, but they have salt and pepper on the table.  No big deal. The over medium eggs where cooked right. I didn't care for the hightop tables and chairs or the soap operas on the hd tv's. Over all, it's better than a Denny's or Ihop I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I first dined here some months ago.  The food was fine but I was put off by our food arriving in stages instead of all at the same time.  My entree came without the toast.  After 5 minutes  or so my husband's meal came, without the toast.  We had ordered a short stack of pancakes to share, and those came some time later.  Our toast came after we had finished everything else.   Since the food was good, even though the service was not, we decided to try it again yesterday.  We each ordered egg entrees and a short stack of pancakes to share.  When we ordered, we specifically asked our waitress to bring out all the food at the same time.  She agreed.  While we waited I noticed the couple at a neighboring table going through the same thing we had experienced on our previous visit....the woman had her food and the man didn't.  After a long wait, our egg entrees were delivered.  We had to ask for butter and jelly, which was finally brought to our table halfway through the meal.  Our pancakes did not arrive.  Our waitress said she would bring them \"shortly.\"  We waited and waited.  We finished our egg entrees, still no pancakes.  Finally the manager stopped by and announced that the pancakes had not been prepared yet but we should \" be patient.\"  Really?  How long does it take for a pancake restaurant to make pancakes?  The manager did not offer to take the pancakes off the bill or compensate us in any way.  As soon as we decided to leave, the (cold) pancakes were delivered to our table.  There are too many places to eat in this city to waste your time here, spend your money where the service is better and your business is appreciated."}
{"text":"Alvin was our waiter and he was great! Very kind and attentive. The reason I'm giving it only a 3 stars is because the biscuits & gravy were cold, as if they'd been taken out of the freezer. He took them back and in less than 30 seconds come back with them. The cook just threw more gravy on top, that was still cold. The eggs were raw but the buttermilk pancakes were great. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"You have to try the German chocolate pancakes. They were great. Great selection on the menu. Lots and Lots of choices. The place gets a bit crowded on Saturday and Sunday mornings. But it is all worth it. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Usually very busy on weekend mornings.  If you can wait for a seat at those times...you can have a good bfast.  I find the pancakes can be overpowering sweet on some choices...but if you tone it down and pair it up with some bacon and eggs...its can be pleasant.
Seating areas are not very large hence the wait when busy..
Coffee is mediocre."}
{"text":"I love the service here.  The first time I came to one of their locations I wasn't to impressed until my girlfriend suggested this new location a couple years later.  I have been here twice in 1 week only because of the service.  There's 2 guys in particular that I adore I don't know their names but I know they both wear glasses.  One has a beard and is almost 6 feet  and the other guy is short with a shaved head.  Keep it up guys you know who you are."}
{"text":"3 stars for the service, but I dont get what the hoopla is about. The pancakes are just ok, the price was perfect though. I don't think Ill be back, but it looks like business is booming! Cant please everyone"}
{"text":"Their pancakes are always amazing & the sizes are perfect for a side or a full stack as a meal. Each pancake is about the size of a coffee cup saucer. The locations are fairly small and can have up to a 30-45 min wait on weekends. Get there early in the morning or around 1 and the crowds are pretty low."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back to this little place when I go back to Vegas!! :D This place is soooo delicious, especially the Red Velvet Pancakes!!! Came in Thursday 11AM and there was still waiting line.. Imagine weekends!! But the wait is sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to breakfast with a friend and my one year old daughter. My friend told me it was a place I must try,  she was not kidding! We arrived around 10 am,  so it was not very busy and we were seated right away.  The hostess noticed my daughter and immediately set us up in a spacious corner table with a high chair.  I didn't have to sit awkwardly with a squirming baby in my lap waiting for a place to put her. 
Our server greeted us very quickly. She was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. Our drink order was taken right away,  my coffee was excellent and clearly fresh. (Bonus points for keeping it fresh after breakfast rush has slowed and there is a lull of customers.)
For breakfast I had the strawberry cream cheese pancakes with a side of toast and a side of bacon. The food looked appetizing and beautiful.  I had gotten the toast for my daughter,  but it was crusty and tasted like it had been sitting out. She shared my french toast and Bacon with me instead. The French Toast was outstanding and the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes. She requested extra lemons and they were delivered immediately. I tasted a bite of her pancakes and they were fantastic. Our coffee was never allowed to become empty or cold. 
Our check arrived on one bill which was promptly split when we asked, even though it was getting busier as early lunch dinners were arriving. The server didn't tell us to pay at the front,  so we waited a while before realizing.  In that time she did walk by us a couple times.  She was very busy,  but it might have been nice for her to stop and just let us know where to pay or ask if we needed something. There were customers waiting at this point so would have been nice for them if we had left that 5-10 minutes earlier. Didn't bother us too much though because we still had coffee and we were chatting. 
Overall it was a great experience and i am excited to take my son and my husband to try it sometime!"}
{"text":"OMG for this place... Fabulous food :o)

Please make sure that all your parties are with you when checking in because they will not give you a table if your party is incomplete. 

The food is amazing. Adobo Fried Rice Omelette is absolutely  my favorite. I've tried their Corned Beef, Loco Moco and most especially their Red Velvet Pancakes (yummylicious).

I've been to three of their locations and all locations have same  consistency in their food, service and ambiance. This place is great for families, group of friends and even if you just want to enjoy an Island food flavor breakfast or brunch. 

Love this place a lot."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!!!! A must go if you love pancakes!!! You name it they have, Red velvet pancakes, bacon pancakes, all types of fruit pancakes, absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Get the kahlua pork/cabbage eggs benedict!  It was delicious.  I would pass on the adobo omelette- flavorless, dry and salty.  We also ordered the bananas foster pancakes which was pretty tasty.  Overall, great breakfast spot but be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Me and 2 kids went in on a Friday morning for breakfast.  1/2 the tables were empty, but we were told there was a 20 minute wait for a table.  We waited in the tiny entry way with about 5 other parties while tables cleared and no one was seated.   Some people who the hostess apparently knew were offered coffee while they waited, but nobody else was.  Our 20 minute wait was actually a 40 minute wait.  We ordered red velvet pancakes, smores pancakes and an omelet. We all thought the food was awful.  It was obviously prepared quickly and just slopped on the plates.  No taste and very poor presentation.  Another thing that really irritated me was $3 for a kid's apple juice.  That is just wrong."}
{"text":"The service wasn't all that great. I'm a huge fan of red velvet pancakes and was anticipating pure yummyness. To be quite frank the pancakes were average. They were dry and rather stiff. In addition, I ordered the steak and eggs and the meat was not cooked properly. I've been here twice and both experiences were rather similar."}
{"text":"I went there this morning at 8:30.order the banana crepe.After an hour I feel shaking hand and body,went to toilet 2 times then feeling better,still not very good"}
{"text":"I have been a few times now. This is a very popular location. Weekend/weekday early/midmorning there is always a wait. I dont think a wait is a bad thing in the resteraunt biz, good things are worth waiting for but me for this isnt that good. Its not bad either. Just an average breakfast spot with some times good and some times bad service. 

For the resteraunt name referancing pancakes I was not impressed with the stacks. They were good but after ordering the white chocolate macadamia nut and receiving plain pancakes with a handfull of white chocolate chips on top with a very small amount of a fine crumble that couldbe madacamia nuts. Why bother? 

I also ordered the HM1 omelette which I picked because it had cilantro however when I received it there was no cilantro. It was good just not what I was expecting. 

One of the best dishes I have had there is the Kahlua pork benedict. I really like this dish. I dont know if the Kahlua pork is made in house but it's good. Basic benedict with a nice helping of Kahlua pork and cabbage."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a nice breakfast at Babystacks! Their menu is filled with so many great eats. I came with a couple of friends since they were visiting and wanted to get some great breakfast. Obviously we were gonna hit up Babystacks for their amazing Red Velvet pancakes {and I typically hate Red Velvet anything}. You also can't go wrong with their Lola Coras Corned beef hash, Adobo fried rice omelet and their Hawaiian Benedict! Yummmmz"}
{"text":"First time eating here it was good. If your looking to try it do it! Lots to choose from.."}
{"text":"The Kailua Pig Benedict sounds a little scary, but please be brave. You will not regret it. Plan on a little wait as it it's always busy, but there is a reason for that.
Come hungry, leave happy!"}
{"text":"On my family's \"annual\" trip to Las Vegas from Cali, we stopped by this place on glowing recommendations from my sister before we headed out of town...we figure we might as well get some good food before losing the rest of our wages.

It was late Friday morning and the place was doing brisk business. We waited for about 10-15 minutes (party of six) and were seated with our drinks taken care of somewhat promptly. All was well...then we placed our orders...that's when my frustration with this place grew. I base my reviews on the quality of the food first, then the service, then ambiance. With regards to service, I want to see that my glass of water is refilled before being emptied and not having to summon a waiter to refill the glass...and for a breakfast place to ensure my cup of coffee is promptly refilled. Well, the coffee wasn't refilled before I could see the bottom of the cup. On top of that, the waitress got our orders messed up once the food finally arrived after a 35 minute wait! 35 minutes! Waiting for our food for 35 minutes from the time we ordered! Unacceptable. The only redeeming quality was that the food was actually pretty good. Everyone on our table liked what they had and were willing to overlook the long wait...I wasn't. If it wasn't for the decent food, I would have given this place 2 stars or 1 star. Our party tried Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Portuguese Sausage and Eggs, and Velvet pancakes, among other things

Really, BabyStacks...35-minute wait for breakfast food? What, you had to coax the chickens out back to push a little harder for some eggs?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. Spam and eggs scramble is my personal favorite however they have a variety of pancakes and Hawaiian dishes. Don't be afraid to upgrade to garlic rice!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. Friendly service and great food what more could you ask for. Pancakes are great. I have tried most of them and haven't had anything bad yet. Just tried a special one toffee lemon Carmel pancakes. Wow is all I can say. The Loco moco is fantastic. Well worth the wait and yes you do wait. Enjoy it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is decent. Breakfast spots typically use the cheapest ingredients etc which I don't like. I come here for the pancakes which are excellent, that is why I give a 4 star rating ..lots of exciting and mouth watering options to choose from. All the other items I can make at home with higher quality ingredients. Come for the pancakes!! Much better than stacks and yolks."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning. The place was pretty packed! I was dying to try they lemon ricotta pancakes. Yum. They were really great but way too big. If you're hungry, this is place is for you. I could only eat half on a pancake. We also got eggs and hash browns. The hash browns weren't my favorite. They could have used a bit more 'crisp' and needed a LOT more salt. Overall, it was pretty go"}
{"text":"The food was great, no complaints there. Price was on par with other breakfast places. The service was really bad. If the service was just ok I would have rated this location 4 star maybe even 5 star. It took almost an hour to get our food, family of 4, we maybe had water refilled twice. I will admit the place was rather busy at the time but I've been to other breakfast places before when they were slammed and didn't get the type of service I received here. I would probably go again but not a Saturday or Sunday."}
{"text":"The food is good like always, but the service at this location needs work. When we came in, no one acknowledged us and there were 3 other groups waiting. There were workers walking around and still never asked us if we have been assisted or greeted us into the establishment. The other 2 groups ended up leaving because they actually weren't acknowledged upon their entrance as well. And even after they walked out, there was no apology for the wait and they just looked at us and said 4 right this way. A greeting goes a long way. Even if you're busy, you should still acknowledge your guests and let them know it would be a moment. Very disappointed in the first point of contact."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service! The food is always good. My favorite red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Great ambient, amazing service and AMAZING FOOD. They have the most outstanding light pancakes. From the lemon ricotta to the red velvet pancakes you will not go wrong. 
These are people who really care about the service they are putting out and the people they are serving. They are very attentive and caring to make sure you have gotten what you ordered.  This place will definitely  will make you a REGULAR. Love love love love this place !"}
{"text":"I don't do alot of reviews at all but This place is dissapointing i think it is all hype we waited for 30 min before we got sat.Ordered the portugese sausage with garlic fried rice,egg and red velvet pancakes sounds good right? But def not! I coulda made the garlic rice waaayyy better at home! It was like it was drenched in oil and they just threw it on the plate...as for the \"so called\" red velvet pancakes shit is disgusting tastes like pure flower which be covered in their \"cheese syrup\" if you want the REAL red velvet pancakes i suggest going to Rise & Shine...nuff said"}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes! Love the different flavors! Skillet Breakfast is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Fast service.  Great price.  We will come back again for sure.  Red velvet pancakes were my favorite"}
{"text":"We found this place using Yelp the month they opened and have been back several times.  They have great food!  Love the Red Velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup and the Contry Fried steak.  Only problem with the place is that we live too far away from it! (we live in California)"}
{"text":"We come here every time we are in town because it's such a treat. Try to go during the off times so you don't have to wait in line. But even if you have to wait it's worth it. The red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup are delicious!  Actually all of the pancakes we have tried are absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was bustling on Sunday morning, but fortunately we only waited for 5 minutes. We were seated at a table right next to the door for the patio. They may want to reconsider seating guests that close. During our whole meal we were interrupted by gusts of air and people passing right next to us. 
Coffee was good, refills prompt. 
I had the special for the day: Mocha Chip Pancakes. The mocha flavor was not discernible. But to for a chocolate chip pancake they were good. 
My friend had eggs Benedict which was cooked beautifully and the hollandaise was creamy and rich. 
Worth the visit, fix the seating and it would be a better experience."}
{"text":"let see.....
come early.
bring a book, your ipad.. a game device... something because you are in for a wait.  truly though.. it's well worth it.  

all reviews are raving about the red velvet pancakes and every positive review is the truth!  it's so moist and yummy it's unexplainable.  

so my little family of 4:  2 adults, 2 tweens... each ordered something different so we could all share.  

mom: loco moco : which was tasty.. nothing special.. all beef patty with yummy gravy over rice, topped with an egg over easy.
dad:  adobo fried rice : super filling and yummy.. this omelet of chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg is huge.  share.
daughter:  s'more pancakes... and a side of egg
son:  spam scramble... it is what it is.. and it is goooood.  :D

and of course... the red velvet pancake!  YUUUUUM-ME!

totally be prepared for the wait.  it's a wait.  they tell everyone 20 minutes and it can carry over 30.  the place is small and with a million people waiting to get in, it's obvious why there's a wait.  i can't wait till this thing spreads like wildfire and chains open.. or they make it bigger.. we definitely need one of these babies in the southwest area!!!

*hint *hint!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, but got the grilled cheese with the smoked pork...very good, 
also had the sweet cream crepes..absolutely yummy!!!  of course also ordered the red velvet pancakes....what can I say...I left happy and full."}
{"text":"Long time listener, first time caller; I'm careful to fall in love but the pancakes at Babystacks really sweep me off my feet. The short stack portion is satisfying and won't run you for more than $6 maximum. I've always felt welcomed by the service here as well.

Hazelnut Pancakes- Gentle but mandatory suggestion: order these with strawberries. 9 out of 10 doctors agree that Nutella is good on its own, but it's proven to be incredible when paired with buttermilk pancakes. I'm certain the dollop of whipped cream brings everything together and negates the need for syrup.

S'mores Pancakes- These have something akin to Golden Grahams cereal in the whipped cream topping, which gives you something to crunch on. The bits of melty chocolate and mini marshmallows do the whole s'mores thing justice. I'm a fan.

Banana Cream Pie Pancakes- Not only do you get some slices of banana in the whipped cream garnish, but there's slices of bananas in the pancakes as well! The banana cream sauce is something like banana pudding. Really, you won't be disappointed by these if you're already a fan of the namesake dessert."}
{"text":"I love the plethora of pancake varieties at Babycakes and have had several but I highly recommend the Orange Cream ones they are to die for! The Banana Cream Pies are pretty darn good too! The chocolate ones are too rich for me but if you really like chocolate they will probably be right up your alley!

I usually have a short stack and share a side of bacon with my friend! 

The service here is usually really friendly and quick but fair warning they are popular and have a small seating area so you might have a tad of a wait (but they are worth it)!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie i love pancakes and i love adobo fried rice....i was reading reviews on this place and realized its like 5min away from where i work and live....So during my lunch break i convinced my coworkers to order from here so we did a group buy and we split an order of red velvet pancakes just so we could try them.  And let me tell you we were all very pleased with our meals and know for sure we will def. be ordering from here again.

The chicken adobo fried rice was awesome and it def hit the spot as being from Hawaii, adobo fried rice is a common thing out there and here in Vegas its always nice to find local Hawaii styled eateries. Yet again another local styled place here in Vegas that makes me less home sick. The service is quick and friendly and the portions are decent for the prices. There is ample parking and its free and its very easy to find as it sits right on buffalo. Def a place i highly recommend for a great breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"It was good food, it was great service, really fast even thought they were slammed.  I think this place is good but I wouldn't pick it out to go again when there are other places in Vegas that are MUCH better.  Nothing wrong with this place, just nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes, with a cream cheese icing syrup- absolutely amazing. No, the syrup may not have been cream cheese- I don't remember, I asked the waitress but was so blown away that I was probably busy licking my plate while she told me about how the syrup was made.

The food here is astonishingly unique, fresh and tasty. We split an order of the red velvet pancakes and an order of Rick's Adobe Fried Rice (a Filipino dish) and the combo of sweet and savory was heavenly.

Worth a trip from the Strip- in fact, this is the best meal we ate the entire time we were in Vegas. Cab it over to Babycakes- this beats any hotel buffet or local color greasy spoon, hands down."}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday, apparently a very busy day. We were told the wait would be 30-35 minutes. No big deal. 

It was hot/stuffy in the waiting area, which is one small bench and something like 3 chairs. It was difficult to determine if people were in line to pay, put their names in, or were just waiting for seating. Additional seating for those waiting might be a good idea - like some benches or chairs outside, since there is no room inside. 

They turned tables fairly quickly, so that was nice. 

We were seated at the table that is right at the end of the wall separating the dining area from the waiting area. It felt a little awkward to be sitting in the seat just past the wall... but that could have just been me. 

The server came by and was friendly and efficeint. 

I ordered the bacon and eggs meal with garlic rice and a side of pancakes with peanut butter (not the chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes). The portions were nice - satisfying - I didn't feel like I would be overeating or having to decide which portion of the meal to take home and eventually waste (I'm weird about leftovers). 

I didn't feel like the garlic rice was as spectacular as others have made it seem, and I definitely don't think adding a few pieces of onion and a little garlic is work an extra $1, but I am admittedly cheap. 

I also had to ask for more syrup, as the amount they give you is maybe enough for 2 bites, not 2 pancakes. 

I don't remember what the husband got, but I do know he felt it was a little pricey for the amount you received. 

Ultimately, it's a decent breakfast place and I'm sure we'll be back from time to time, but at the moment it's not a \"top choice\" list."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Went here today for the first time and was impressed. The place is pretty big, very clean and nicely decorated. 

Quickly seated and was asked for our drinks immediately. Our sever was very sweet, service was quick, food came out quickly and was delicious.

I ordered the Kalua Benedict, this was very tasty. They put a lot of meat on the Benedict and a lot of sauce. This was delicious but is very heavy.. Do not order this if you do not want a big and heavy breakfast. My brother got the huevos rancheros and said the portion at this location is smaller than at the other location but that it was still very tasty. Both the green and red salsas were very good.. Not too salty and not too sour. We also orders a short stack of the pancakes and turkey bacon. Overall very satisfying meal, will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Get the Red velvet pancakes. The burrito and pumpkin pancakes were also delicious. We went on a Saturday around 1 and had to wait less than ten minutes"}
{"text":"Great food friendly service don't listen to the negative nancies.. I feel they say things just to have an opinion!  Def a great place to come"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Any kind of breakfast food I crave can be found here. Warning: the wait times are insane! So make sure to get there early. I've gone twice now, first time I got the breakfast burrito and the second time I wanted to get a little crazy and get the loco moco. This place is def a go to"}
{"text":"Delicious food- super fresh and staff is warm and welcoming. New favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Good pancakes, but overpriced for the quality & portion sizes. The idea of Red Velvet pancakes (which is what I ordered) is awesome & the fact that it is topped with whip cream & chocolate chips is also awesome, but it is not a super powerful red velvet flavor for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in town & they have a large selection  of flavors. The Loco Moco is amazing!
The service is always friendly & fast."}
{"text":"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

I'm so happy your here Baby Stacks Cafe...  So much closer... and a little tiny bit larger.

Same menu.... some of the same delightful staff... 
The only thing is.... at the other location they'd say-  \"20 minutes...\"
Here... they say 30.   whaaaaaaaat?  
I still love you.  I still love your red velvety pancakes and Huntington Omelets.... and 20 other types of pancakes.  

We ate there twice last week.  
Just saying.  

I love you."}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast off the strip if you're not feeling hash house or your usual bacon and egg breakfast spot. Menu looks good, but I always get the adobo fried rice omelette and upgrade the side order with red velvet pancakes. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is packed a good sign.  30 mins later were seated.  Not a second later our waiter is taking care of us we order our food it comes out looking excellent I got bacon pancakes they were delish!! Overall great service I will come back on my next refeed much Mahalos!"}
{"text":"If you're going to Vegas and coming in from north 95 or maybe want to get out of Vegas and eat somewhere normal, non-tourist filled, come here!  

Easy off and back on from 95, it's located in a small shopping center but there's nothing strip mall about it... friendly staff, clean and neat layout, plenty of customers for a Monday morning, and a veritable plethora of pancake choices for the carbs-be-damned crowd.  Their main menu goes from the basic eggs breakfast to a variety of Filipino and Hawaiian inspired dishes.  Spam for breakfast... sure.  Chicken Adobo omelette... of course.

I went simple:  nicely marinated Kalbi ribs and eggs, offered tomatoes on the side instead of potatoes or rice. since I was saving my carbs for the peanut butter pancakes.  Delish...!   Hubby had plain eggs with chunky potatoes which he said seemed kinda Or-Ida type, but which his bananas Foster pancakes more than made up for.  Momma had ham and eggs with your basic buttermilk pancakes and hash browns.  Given there was nothing left on her plate, I'd have to say she enjoyed her meal...

Enjoyed it so much, I know we'll time our next trip to make a stop here for sure...

**they must get very busy at times:  there was a sign on the door, first come first served, no reservations and they won't seat your party until everyone is present so be forewarned **"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I shared the kahlua pig eggs benedict and the red velvet pancake. Server is nice, and we didn't wait long for food. 

KAHLUA PIG EGGS BENEDICT is good, but not great. I guess I had higher expectations due to reviews raving about it. The crab eggs benedict in Magnolia Cafe in San Antonio, TX is still the best for me. It's far though. 

The HASH BROWNS that came with the eggs benedict is good. Had some weird tasting hash in some breakfast places in Vegas. This is what I remember a hash should be. 

RED VELVET PANCAKE is awesome. Trumps any pancake I've eaten in my life. It's fluffy and moist, and has the right amount of sweetness. The portions are just right to fill me up. I give it 5 stars because their pancake is awesome. They trump any other breakfast place around town. (This doesn't exclude the high class breakfast places on the Strip, which I haven't tried yet.)

We'll be back again, but in their resto in Spring Valley. I think they're opening another branch, but I can't remember where. Hopefully it's close to where we live."}
{"text":"I went to Babystacks in Summerlin. First time here. Our server here is way better. She's nice and anticipated our needs. 

RED VELVET PANCAKES - delicious and fluffy like the one I had in Summerlin. 

RICK's ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE - really good. Adobo is not greasy and just gives enough flavor. There's a lot of meat inside so it's not all egg. It's really good.

Total came up to $26. 

Babystacks is our favorite breakfast place in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I don't like waiting an hour to eat. Make the place bigger already. And drop the price a tad. You guys act like your serving gold for food"}
{"text":"So, I finally got to go here.  I brought my dad here for a belated fathers day breakfast.   We both had the two egg breakfast with pancakes-regular and red velvet.  

First, my eggs were delicious!  They tasted so fresh and were cooked just as I had asked-over medium.  I got them with seasoned potatoes which were not seasoned at all-just fried little squares.  But, that is fine cuz they soaked up my yolk just fine.  Dad said his eggs were great and he got hashbrowns that were cooked perfectly crispy and not at all greasy.

Now onto the pancakes.  He got just the plain pancakes and they were not good at all!  It was like the dry mix was missing the sugar or there was too much baking soda.  They almost had a sour taste-blech. 
I was dying to try the red velvet.  I love, love, love red velvet cupcakes but sometimes they are just too sweet for me.  So when i read about these and that they aren't that sweet I had to come in and try them.  Okay, they were just okay.  I just feel like there was something missing.  They were a good texture and the cream cheese syrup was okay.  

I will come back and try other things.  The omletes looked really good as do the eggs benedict, sandwiches...well it all looked good.  This is a nice small NON-CHAIN (love that) place that hopefully continues to do well and sticks around.  We need more of this kind establishment to help give the town some heart!"}
{"text":"This place will probably have a spot in my heart forever. It's definitely my favorite breakfast spot in the area. It's a good Hawaiian/Filipino/American breakfast fusion place. The standouts, IMO, are their various flavors of pancakes and Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (which comes wrapped in an omelette). I usually get the Red Velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup, but they have a huge variety on the menu plus whatever flavors are listed on their chalkboard for the day. I am also weirdly partial to their Loco Moco (both chili and non-chili versions) even though that's not unique to them. Their service is extremely friendly and sweet, if slow at times. 

They recently stopped allowing split checks. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about dining here with friends. It's definitely enough of a nuisance that sometimes my friends and I declined not to eat here simply because of that."}
{"text":"While I do love the food, do not plan to eat with more than 4 people. It's extremely small and they won't put tables together to accommodate more than 4 people. Waited an hour and watched many tables turn over and get seated before our party of 8."}
{"text":"Family breakfast together. Grandmother to grandchildren. The menu is awesome and the food is great! We ordered the Hawaiian spam and eggs scramble with the garlic rice. Amazing!! And we upgraded our pancakes to the hazelnut with Nutella. Need I say more? The only reason for the 4 stars is the place is small so you have to wait, but they do their best to turn tables over and when you're in, the service is great!

Last week we made the mistake of going to some griddlecakes place and it was horrible! Don't bother. They can't touch Baby Stacks."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. It was pretty decent. Woulve given them a 5 star except they were down a cook and it took forever to get our food. Other than that their food was great. I ordered their Huevos Rancheros!"}
{"text":"If your favorite cake flavor is Red Velvet, the Red Velvet Pancakes will hit home for you like it did for me. I'm a Red Velvet fanatic so I was in immediate heaven as soon as I took my first bite. I am typically not a fan of extras like whipped cream or chocolate chip toppings, but I welcomed each and every savory bite. This menu item also came with its own cream cheese syrup but I felt like the pancakes were so fresh and perfectly done that it didn't need any extras. I even ended up eating the entire thing after my Spam & Scrambled Eggs order!

This is definitely one of my top breakfasts spots. I can't wait to come back again to try the rest of the menu. The place is small, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are already considering an expansion or additional locations because it was so busy when we got there. No wonder this place is so popular, the food is great, service is served with a smile and everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast/brunch spot, if you can stand the wait. I got lucky on my first visit and only waited a few minutes, but on my second visit, we waited nearly an hour :(

Between the two visits:

Highlights were the red velvet pancakes (yum all around), adobo fried rice omelette and corned beef hash w/ garlic rice

Be warned, the garlic rice isn't just a hint of garlic, it's full force garlic, which was fine by me. 

Lemon ricotta pancakes had great flavor, but the texture was soggy, which is why I probably wouldn't order it again.

Being from Hawaii, I love places that remind me of home, which Babystacks does. If you are able to visit them on a weekday, do it! Or have a snack before trying them on a weekend/holiday."}
{"text":"Very good. People are nice. Definitely need to come when your visiting in the area. The place is small looks like it could get busy but we came around 11:30 so we were seated immediately. Again the people here are very nice. Food was good and served hot. My boys loved it."}
{"text":"Very busy! Cant complain it was sooo good!! I ordered the homemade corn beef hash, 2eggs and garlic fried rice! I cleaned my plate out lol. My husband ordered the chilli moco and he also enjoyed it!! Joan and Krissy was awesome!!

 I recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly servers. Portuguese sausage and eggs is my fave...with a side of red velvet pancakes..."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast around 8am on Monday. Not overly busy and were seated right away.  Staff was friendly and prompt. Liked the large selection of pancakes and variety of the other menu items. Ordered the Red Velvet short stack which was three pancakes, topped with homemade whipped cream, chocolate cookie crumble and cream cheese syrup. The pancakes were good enough to eat plain, nothing else was required but lliked the cream cheese topping as well. Husband has eggs with Portuguese sausage and the garlIc rice. We love Portuguese sausage and was impressed the menu has Hawaiian style food as well. The garlic rice was different but needed a tad more seasoning. All well prepared and enjoyable.  Better than the other breakfast place we tried. 

Need to try some other pancake flavors and more of the Hawaiian specialties next time!"}
{"text":"Food was cold. Coffee was stale. There was a hair in my eggs. Just terrible. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Henderson location but happy this one opened close to home. I ordered the same thing I always do which is veggies skillet and hazelnut pancakes.  The pancakes were really dry and no flavor at all.  The veggies skillet was okay but not great. Service was great just like the other locations."}
{"text":"After reading all the fabulous reviews, I've been dying to try this place!

Babycakes is nestled in a tiny plaza (which I didn't see anything that was corporate, just Mom & Pop places) on Buffalo, near Smoke Ranch. 

My friend and I showed up here at 11:25am on a Saturday and were told a 45 minute wait.  No prob!  Gave us time to catch up.  45 minutes later we go up to the hostess stand and were told we needed to wait another 20-30 minutes longer.  ugh!  really?  I was ready to gnaw off my arm!

Finally, an hour and five minutes later, we were sat.  We decided to order:
-A Single Nutella Crepe w/ Strawberries: served w/ whipped cream and almonds.
TO.DIE.FOR!  OMG!  Everything you expect in a delicious crepe with Nutella.  The fresh strawberries sent it over the edge.  So good!

We shared:
- Short Stack of Red Velvet Pancakes: topped w/ whipped cream & chocolate crumbles, served with cream cheese syrup.

These were very good.  More like a dessert, but delicious!  The cream cheese syrup is what seals the deal!  It's like frosting, just a little thinner and not AS sugary as frosting.  Really.  You are eating cake for breakfast- and no one is judging!

My husband asked me to bring him home the Tuna Sandwich on Wheat.  The tuna was good, but not \"like mom makes\" if that makes sense.  We didn't touch the fries because they were cold by the time I got home.  

I want to go back to get the Adobo Fried Rice and the Cinnamon Bun or the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes. (those pancakes are seasonal).  I also want to try the hashbrowns,  bacon and omelettes.  

Yes, everything looked delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast this morning. Alls I can say is WOW! He had the Cinnabon pancakes, and they were delicious. I had the red velvet pancakes, and oh my god, they are a little bit of heaven in every bite. I would choose this place over ihop any day. Pancakes are out of this world. 
Also, the service was great, Janie was quick and on top of things. A must do again breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice, bright, clean place with friendly staff. I had the orange creme pancakes, lovely presentation, very sweet creme and icing sugar syrup. I know I'll be craving more sweets all day, OMG, we are now driving behind a cupcake truck, I'm thinking I can just hop in the back till I just roll out. They also have a discounted Senior special at Babystacks, so that's another good thing"}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast one morning every time we are in Vegas. So many crazy pancake options, I try a new one every time we go! You can't go wrong. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"It was ok.... small place so the seating is easy to close to each other.... staff was friendly, pancakes were like any other pancake place lol"}
{"text":"Fast service. On Sunday's it's always super busy so I suggest going on a weekday. They do a good of using Philippine influence for their dishes. I love that I can get rice and eggs together."}
{"text":"We decided to try this local favorite for breakfast and even though it was a Saturday morning on Memorial day weekend if was not overly crowded and the service was outstanding! I decided on the Ortega chile skillet, with bananas foster cakes! My meal was very tasty, warm and lo cal! Just kidding, but our food was delicious! The green chile was medium to mild, the potatoes were moist and fresh, the eggs cooked to a perfect over medium! Our pancakes were fluffy and warm, the caramel sauce and warm bananas absolutely delicious! Kudos to our server Kaylah  she was delightful, very friendly and helpful! Gomer and I highly recommend this hidden gem in Henderson! Have a great Memorial day weekend and Thank you to all who have served or currently serve our great country in the military!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH, if you're considering it... and even if you weren't, GO!!!!!

I literally miss this dish and dream of it constantly.. at any location it is cooked to perfection.. I am referring to ( you guessed it!) the Country Fried Steak. Since eating this dish at BabyStacks, I haven't touched it at any other restaurant because it just will not compare. 

The pancakes are phenomenal and fun as well because of all the different flavors. Makes it feel like you're at an ice cream shop for pancakes. Or a cake shop...........

Love bringing my tourist family and friends here because it's fair prices, off the strip and literally a slice of heaven, literally ;) I also come here a lot with local friends. When you walk in you see that it's the community here - all of them happy because their tummies are full of yummy eats. Impress someone and show them this restaurant, it's fantastic.

Now for the nitty gritty: it is absolutely crowded on the weekends. You will wait up to an hour sometimes to be seated and it is well worth the wait! Customer service is great. Food comes out quickly. Don't be daunted by the crowd - take it as a good indication.

Every location is fantastic!! I've been to three and had the same good experience at them all.
Enjoy :D"}
{"text":"This was a very cute sit down. The food was good and they were great portions to share. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointment today. Babystacks has always been to go-to spot for delicious pancakes but I guess the same love and care isn't given to the less - inventive selections. Craving blueberry pancakes today so I chose to brave babystacks on a Sunday for my fix. The wait wasn't too bad and my server was amazing (Berniece I think).

But the pancakes. The people on either side of me had piles of happiness for pancakes. However, my full stack didn't have a single pancake with more than two blueberries(I just uploaded photos of them on here) . Then it was topped with maybe 10 defrosted frozen blueberries and a shake of powdered sugar. 

Didn't even finish. I paid for them and left.  Never thought I'd say this but I think I'll drive to IHOP to get a better breakfast. 

I might give it another try but feeling burned today."}
{"text":"When we first moved here almost three years ago, Babystacks was a great little breakfast place! Now, things have gone downhill. The service is painfully slow, and if you need something that you didn't ask for at the beginning you may never get it before you finish eating. The food here is fine, it's a nice breakfast but nothing to write home about and it's pricier than other, better places in town."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Food comes out fast, hot and tasty always. My favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in. Being a breakfast restaurant owner, I LOVE trying other places to see their creativity and try the menu. 

My sister and I sampled the red velvet pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes, spam and eggs and a side of country gravy and potatoes.

I thought the red velvet pancakes were just OK.. I think they'd be better without all of the melted chocolate on top of them. It seems to be way to sweet/bitter with them. The cinnamon roll pancakes were DELICIOUS. 

The spam was disappointing, and I LOVE spam. This was actually too salty to eat. The breakfast potato is just your run of the mill frozen breakfast potato so nothing to say really there. The gravy almost tasted like a ham gravy or maybe bacon gravy. There wasnt really any meat to be seen in it although it did taste more homemade than some places I've had gravy at. 

I would go back to maybe try some other pancake varieites"}
{"text":"Sadly, I was greatly disappointed with all pancakes we ate; orange creamsicle, Carrot cake, and blueberry. The blueberry was the best of the 3, but I've eaten better elsewhere. The pancakes were overpowered by one ingredient and the artificial flavoring was \"no bueno.\" There was a moment I regretted not getting the red velvet stack, but soon as I saw the next table cut into the bright red center, which screamed artificial flavoring, that feeling quickly left. My sis ordered the strawberry crepe, which had to be doused with strawberry and cream cheese syrups to add flavoring. 

IF, I was ever brought back here, I would stick with the coffee (strong like I like it), bacon and square hash browns. Those were good and kept me from leaving the restaurant hungry. 

Bottom line: The service was great, but I'm a girl who likes to save her calories and this meal wasn't worth the extra pounds on the scale."}
{"text":"Been going to babystacks for years and it hits the spot. Here are a few tips. 
1. Weekends are always busy. You will wait. If you have a large party or small party you will wait. Make sure everyone in your party is there or you will not be seated and you will wait. Once you're seated service is usually fast
2. Best time to come is a tues-thurs when school is in session. So a Tuesday in may is perfect and they will actually sit an incomplete party when they are empty
3. Get the pancakes. This is what they are known for. Red velvet is amazing but you may need insulin after. So is their bananas foster
4. Coffee isn't the best here, pretty weak tasting, but maybe you're into that. But it's always hot and they're usually really good at refills
5. Food doesn't come out piping hot. Usually just warm. For a while I was turned off by this, but number 3 gives you the reason why we go here. But hey at least they're consistent
6. I love that they have both hash browns and potatoes as options
7. They try to move you in and out of the place quick so if you come on a busy time, don't expect to just hangout after you're done eating."}
{"text":"Lots of great breakfast choices, had the Portuguese Sausage, Eggs, and Garlic rice which was great. My friend had the Corned Beef Hash which was also delicious. The breakfast came with buttermilk pancakes and upgraded them to the Red Velvet pancakes- wow, they were amazing! A large selection of breakfast dishes and more unique pancake choices then I've ever seen! We went at 8:00am on a Sunday, had no wait but there was a line when we left. Nothing fancy about the place, just wonderful food. Our server was friendly and efficient. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast places!"}
{"text":"Food
--------    

[Taste] 3 out of 5: (Chili Skillet ordered with Carrot Cake Pancakes)

Food tastes of a decently cooked meal that one can cook for themselves at home. It's honestly pretty bland and needed to be spiced up with a lot of Tabasco. By the looks and taste of the dish, the cooks are very inexperienced. The carrot cake pancakes were so overcooked they were brown and had the texture of a Frisbee. The chili tasted like canned chili, microwaved and put on top of the skillet. However, the food was  definitely edible enough to finish the entire meal.

[Presentation] 2 out of 5::

Very simple presentation on a plate. Nothing fancy. I'm used to way better presentation at competing, similarly priced breakfast restaurants. Again, it seems the cooks are very inexperienced, or have little direction or guidance from the owners. 

Environment
------------------

[Seating] 2 out of 5: 

Very uncomfortable seating arrangement. Tables are too close together and wobbly. The staff also doesn't seem to understand how to seat people. There are plenty of open tables but people are still waiting in line. Booths are pretty much non-existent. The existing booths are straight-up hard wood with no comfort cushions or padding. 

[Concept] 4 out of 5:

You can't go wrong with a breakfast joint! People that love breakfast can be loyal patrons if you get the right people designing your restaurant atmosphere and concept. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, coffee, everyone loves these things.

[Service] 3 out of 5:

Service is OK. There doesn't seem to be any \"type\" that the restaurant hires. All really good restaurants don't hire everyone that puts in an application. Good restaurants hire the right person for the job and the concept of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My daughter and I couldn't decide what to get....so we chose to get a few things and doggy bag the rest. The Red Velvet Pancakes, Chocolate Peppermint Pancakes,  and  the Honey French Toast Combo is what we narrowed it down to. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!  SOOOOO GOOOOD!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here to try the breakfast and it was delicious! I ordered the adobo omelette and my family ordered the eggs with Portuguese sausage and kalua pig grilled cheese. It was a lot of food and reminded me being back home in Hawaii. Only thing is the service was kind of slow and we were in a rush to drive back to California."}
{"text":"Omg. I was so excited to come here for the first time and have Red Velvet pancakes. There was a wait, but it was definitely worth it. The pancakes were absolutely delicious. My Red Velvet pancakes were incredible with the small cup of icing and whipped cream. I savoured every bite and it was like a party in my mouth!! I would love to come here again!"}
{"text":"Well this was my first time eating there. I have to say even on a Sunday morning with a ton of business it was a good experience. The food was amazing; pancakes are phenomenal and the potatoes were great! Only complaint was on how long it took to get the check"}
{"text":"My best friend is always raving about this place and we were nearby on a Sunday morning, starving of course. 

Pulling in I saw a long line, I was thinking about leaving since I was on a tight schedule so I walked in an asked how long the wait time was, for two people it was only 20 minutes so I decided to stick around, for others with larger groups, the wait time was an hour, eek. In the end I only ended up waiting 10 minutes. 

I felt a little bit claustrophobic walking in, it was really packed and all of the tables were very close together. You could lean over and eat off of your neighbors plate! 

Our waitress came out quick and took our order. For my drink  I decided to go with coffee, blah! It was gross. The coffee tasted watered down like they prepared it, dumped half of it out and refilled it with water, I could get a better tasting cup at McDonald's. For my breakfast entree I went with Cora's corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and substituted the buttermilk pancakes, instead I got the red velvet pancakes.

Food came out quick as well, the corned beef hash was seasoned well, tasted great, but my eggs came out over easy instead of over medium. The red velvet pancakes were mighty tasty, very fluffy and a little crisp on the outside. They were topped off with whipped cream, which went well with the cream cheese syrup. After our food came out the waitress disappeared, we were to never see her again. We were never asked how the food was or if we wanted any refills. We are very generous tippers when we get great service, on this occasion I was thinking of not even leaving a tip but I'm not that rude, she got $3 for her disappearing act! 

Honestly, if it weren't for the food, I would have rated this place two stars, but since the food was great (minus the eggs), they get four from me."}
{"text":"Really good Hawaiian style breakfast joint in Las Vegas. I ordered the Kalua pig Benny and the misses ordered red velvet pancakes and a side of garlic fried rice and eggs 

The Benny was really good except for one of poached eggs were too boiled and become a soft boiled egg. The seasoned potatoes on my dish were lightly seasoned but still satisfying. I didn't try the hash browns but from the plates I've seen they look good. 

The red velvet pancakes were delicious! Very very well made and had a good flavor. We had to order an extra cream cheese syrup for the pancakes. 

Overall this a really good place to go for a Hawaiian style breakfast off the strip!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place from so many people and I finally got time to check it out. Tried the cinnabun pancakes, the bacon pancakes, the kalua pig benedict and of course no breakfast is complete without a side of bacon. 
Starting with the kalua pig benedict with shredded pork shredded cabbage egg poached medium and hollandaise on an english muffin. I thought it was awful the hollandaise was a strange bright yellow almost gold instead of the very light yellow which I think is normal.  The whole dish had a strange taste to it thanks to that sauce.
The bacon pancakes were good but nothing you couldn't make at home by just dropping crumbled bacon into batter while making pancakes. Side of bacon you cant go wrong with, it would be very hard to mess that up.
The cinnabun pancakes were delicious. A little too sweet to make a whole meal out of them but as a side of 3 pancakes it was just right. I also got a side of cream cheese syrup which went great with the cinnabun pancakes. Big sugar rush though. 
Service was attentive,  coffee was refilled, food came out quickly everything you would expect from a breakfast spot. I will give it another shot but definitely order different stuff."}
{"text":"my family loves this place! the food is so GOOD and we never have to wait too long. they have lots of creative dishes on the menu for great prices.

the only thing we wish they had more of....space. we love to bring our friends and family from out of town here but the restaurant seems hard pressed to accommodate larger groups. other than that I would definitely recommend you try babystacks!!"}
{"text":"FYI this location doesn't do Togo orders between 9am and 12pm on Saturday and Sundays. You can't even go in to order Togo. So if someone is sick and craving strawberry pancakes...Tuff. You MUST eat in the restaurant or wait till the afternoon. WOW. Babystacks knows customer service."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Brother and I ordered red velvet pancakes, Portuguese sausage, scramble eggs, hash brown (extra crispy), and cinnabun pancakes.

Red velvet was perfect: not too thick on the flavor and not too light, fluffy in the middle. Comes with icing and whipped butter which complemented perfectly. Highly recommend.

Cinnabun pancakes were very sweet and tasted like a donut. If you like sweet pancakes, this is your pancake.

Portuguese sausage were on point: nice flavor and goes well with eggs and hash brown. Highly recommend.

Overall great place and will come back!"}
{"text":"It's was so yummy. Potcho sausage almost as good as home but da red velvet pancake was da winna!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm.....hhmmmmmm!!!! this place is sure is yummma delicious!!!! 
first off, there red velvet pancakes are so good & tasty. top with your cream cheese whip cream. so...so...good!!! second, there kalua pig Benedict was the bestest!!!! so much flavor it was great. we would definitley go back for some more !!!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome breakfast and is cheap! Their red velvet pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever had! The frosting, homemade whipped cream, and super fluffy pancakes are a killer combo. 

I had the loco moco with extra gravy and over easy eggs on garlic rice. I practically licked my plate clean. 

There can be a wait for a table but it does go pretty fast. It's a bit of a drive from the strip, but totally worth it"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I've been to 2 different locations and this one is a little smaller, but less crowded than the other. 

The service was very friendly, quick, efficient. We were seated right away (I mean, it was 7am so...obviously it wasn't very crowded). Took our orders right away and they were also ready quickly.

Both times I've been, I got a \"skillet,\" which is a type of meat and combination of veggies and cheese on top of some country potatoes with 2 eggs any style on top. I know this place is named after its pancakes, but honestly, if I don't have some none-carbohydrate food in the morning, I get hungry again 20 minutes later. 20 pancakes? Hungry in 20 minutes. 20 pancakes and 1 egg? Hungry in...many hours. I had the carnitas skillet (delicious) and some sort of chicken skillet (very good) and was very pleased with those decisions.

Over 20 flavors of pancakes make this your toughest decision of the morning. I think pretty much any way you go, you'll get something delicious. I've had the PB & banana and the plain banana and both were fantastic; my older sis raved over the chocolate mint chip 'cakes as well. Anything you're into, they put in a pancake here, and they'll sub in flavored pancakes for the plain ones to any skillet or omelet meal. Definitely do that.

Highly recommend, the earlier in the morning you can go the better! Can't wait for my next trip here!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pancakes I've ever had period.  If u r in Vegas u need to eat here well worth the 8 mile drive from the strip. Service is great Felicia was awesome and I will b coming back every time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Great casual , good food place. We had 4 different dishes which all turned out tasty. They even had a senior citizen dish for my dad. They should hand a few more choices though. Service was great"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times while I was in town, and I would definitely give them 4 or 5 stars for the food, but maybe 3 stars for the prices, which is kind of expensive.  Everything is close to, or around, the $10 range.  

I always get the infamous red velvet pancakes that everybody else gets and they're definitely pretty good.  Loco moco is also good, but nothing to write home about.  The same for the portugese sausage and eggs.  If it's a weekend, go early to avoid the crowd and long wait!!  Like before 8:00.  Everybody and their grandmother is there on the weekends!!!"}
{"text":"This place was really awesome. They had so many delicious choices on their menu, but my best friend recommended their red velvet pancakes. So glad I ordered the red velvet pancakes! It was to die for! And the sauce that came with it made it even more that delicious! It's been a week since I've been to Babystacks, and I am so craving for them! I'm from California and only came to visit last weekend! Too bad they don't have anything like Babystacks near where I live. Till next time I get to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I visit this place frequently and I must say its one of my favorite local breakfast spots! The food is always outstanding and service is always intact. This last visit, Nicole was our waitress at the bar top, and she was so nice!

My friend Jeff ordered the Portuguese Sausage & Eggs, upgraded to garlic rice (additional $1.00), and had a side of red velvet pancakes - must try!!

I ordered a veggie omelette; there's one already pre-selected on the menu or you can build your own. The omelette comes with a side of fruit or breakfast potatoes and your choice of toast.

They have a big selection to choose from on their menu and their portions are big. This is a great spot if you're a local. You're taste buds will thank you!! 

Just a little FYI: They won't seat you unless you're entire party has arrived and they don't split checks."}
{"text":"If you have never been here it is a must when in Vegas.  It's in Henderson but with the trip to have breakfast!!"}
{"text":"So! We (Lindsey & Kilo) love this place! We lived 5 minutes from this place for 7 months and was very sad to leave. This is a family atmosphere! Super chill and friendly. All the servers treat you like family. We miss you all so much! 
Then! The good stuff! The food! Every time you come .... wait ... wait ..there is always a wait.... and it is worth it! We even tried take out ! And even the take out was delish!  Fried rice omelette so good! Pancakes !!! Coffee!!!! Kids loved the Portuguese sausage and eggs! When we visit our family, we will def be back!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast food here.  I got the Hazelnut pancakes and my girlfriend got the white chocolate macadamia nut one. Both were really tasty and not too rich. I should have got the red velvet pancakes cause they looked really good.  Service was fast as well. I'll definitely be back when I'm in Vegas next time."}
{"text":"Get there early for brunch on Sundays. Unlimited coffee refills and tons of options. This is a family favorite for us :)"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and end up eating local kine grindz. I had the Hawaiian eggs Benedict. Comes with furikake on top! Also had to get a side of the banana cream pie short stack. Everything was so ono (delicious!). The best part... When the bf asked for shoyu, they gave us the best kind, aloha brand. We got seated right away, the service was great, food was amazing. If I were to ever move to Vegas, I would have to come here frequently, it feels like home."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out given the amazing reviews, we were staying near by and most importantly because they had local food from hawaii. 
Being from hawaii, it's hard to find good food from back at home that hasn't lost its taste along the way.
Our server was Jacob, who was the sweetest & very helpful! 

Pancakes:
White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut- overall it was alight,but it did get tough after a couple of minutes. Wished there was a special sauce to go with it but that's just my preference. 
Rocky Road - probably the best pancake we had on the table, it was soft, chocolatey & the marshmallow cream scoop on top made it even better! 
Orange Dreamsicle- tastes exactly what it sounds like, cream and orange. 

Food:  
Kalua Pig Benedict w/no cabbage. It was overall good, but I'm a Benedict fanatic and found that the hollandaise seemed like it was missing something (maybe some citrus?) I couldn't put my finger on what it was. The Kalua pig itself was ono! Not tough, moist and flavorful.
Kalbi & Rice- the kalbi was marinated well and the flavors were there. The rice was a little hard like it didn't have enough water when cooking so it wasn't as moist as I'm used to but non the less, it was good!
Huntington Omelette- good, liked that the pico was on the side! 
Side of Portuguese Sausage- it wasn't what I was expecting, it tasted more like a link Sausage than a regular Portuguese sausage. I'm used to Redondo, Hawaiian style brand or Gouveas but something about this one didn't taste like what I'm used to. 

Overall the experience was good, the food was good for somewhere that offers local hawaii food in the mainland & id come here again."}
{"text":"A couple of my family members and some of my boyfriend's family members had breakfast here on our last day in Vegas. My boyfriend's cousin spoke very highly of this place, so we had to give this place a try, especially since he told us that some of the dishes are Filipino inspired.

Since there were a lot of us, we all tried to order something different so we could try each other's food if we wanted. The food here is AMAZING!!! The red velvet pancakes are a piece of heaven on a plate and the Portuguese sausages are delightful as well. They also have delicious garlic fried rice, which is basically a comfort food if you are Filipino. It honestly gave me my rice fix since I was having withdrawals on this trip. For bacon lovers, like my boyfriend, there are bacon pancakes that are mouthwatering. My sister's fiancée had Rick's Adobo Rice dish, which was very delicious and was large enough for two people. All of the dishes are reasonably priced and they do give you good portion sizes here.

The service that we had was on point as well. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and refilled our drinks when she saw that we were running low. A+ in my book

Overall, this place will not disappoint! There are a wide variety of pancake combinations and the other items on the menu are also a wonderful treat. I'm looking forward to dining at this place again in the near future."}
{"text":"Loved it. Awesome food and awesome staff. Thanks for the great recommendations, Danielle! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The skillet breakfast was served in a side dish \"boat\". That is just too cheap! How much could 1 more cut up potato cost? Pancakes came out have the size as ones pictured. I sent them back and the replacements were beautiful. Pancake recipe is very good, light and fluffy. Server was very gracious. Just don't order a  half sided \"skillet\" served in a boat dish. Great selection of pancakes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Service is exceptional. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I recommend this joint to everyone I know for GREAT breakfast!"}
{"text":"With all the good reviews and always seeing a line out the door when driving by, one might think this place is worth trying.  And so we did.  I'm not usually one to wait but we did since we were excited to try a new breakfast place and one with a Hawaiian twist. 
Our wait time was about 30 mins but I also noticed new arrivals being seated before us?  Weird. While we waited to be seated we looked the menu over and just couldn't decide, everything looked so amazing.
  I settled on 'homemade'corned beef hash with garlic fried rice, my husband had the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes. Well, while the corned beef may be homemade it tasted like the stuff we buy in the can, the fried onions with rice...I mean the garlic rice with onion, whoa!  Hours after eating that and brushing and gargling I am still breathing onions and garlic.  And when my rice has been sitting in my rice cooker for to long the grains on the side of the pot get really hard and are undesirable to eat,  there was alot of those grains in my fried rice.
Now my husband's pancakes, underwhelming to say the least, just no flavor and very dry. He was very disappointed and he LOVES pancakes!  He said he'd rather stay home and make store bought mix. This restaurant is named after a stack of pancakes, so why does the syrup come in a condiment cup? 
Probably won't come back, which is sad since we love breakfast and especially Hawaiian breakfast (being from Hawaii). Who knows, never say never right?  If we ever do go back and it's good I will look forward to upgrading this review. 

Oh wait!  The staff is very friendly however the servers are so busy we only got checked on once and towards the end of the meal... Good thing we didn't need anything. Two stars for being friendly."}
{"text":"I'm SO glad my friend introduced me to BabyStacks!! I was in town and my friend who lives in Vegas wanted to take me to a local eatery in Vegas, away from The Strip. It was about 10 minutes away from The Strip and BabyStacks is a small casual cafe in a local plaza. There were so many choices to choose from, but I had to try their famed Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm usually not a huge fan of Red Velvet since I've had enough as a dessert and I find it usually a bit too sweet with their cream cheese frosting. I was a bit afraid that it would be too sweet for pancakes, but I was wrong. BabyStacks Cafe was the first and perhaps the best red velvet pancakes I have ever had. The pancakes was not too sweet and its syrup was just right that didn't left me feeling like I already indulged a load of sugar for the morning. I got the short stack which was enough for me for 3 pancakes. It's affordable with entrees costing less than $10! BabyStacks Cafe is a casual cafe that seems to be known within the locals, so it didn't felt like it was all touristy. Their service was great and the waitress welcomed me as a newcomer which I thought it was a pleasant experience at BabyStacks. BabyStacks is definitely bookmarked for my future visits to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now with same results. Great food and service. All the items on the menu that I've tried so far have not disappointed. Servers are quick to respond to request and are very friendly. I'm looking forward to trying the centennial location and I hope it's as good."}
{"text":"Always a good place for breakfast.  I've tried 3 of their flavored pancakes at different times (all good) and decided on tiramisu pancakes today, but not a fan, not much flavor to it. Looking forward to go down the list and try the rest of flavored pancakes."}
{"text":"Baby stacks

We saw this place and thought we'd give them a try being that we're from Hawaii. They were labeled as Hawaiian breakfast and brunch. They have multiple locations but we went to the one on 550 N Stephanie St, Henderson. There hours are from 7-2p and parking is easy to find right in front. 

We went around 10a and we waited for about 15 minutes. It was pretty busy. The staff is nice and once we ordered, the food came out quick. One thing, I wouldn't really say they're Hawaiian but they do have spam and portuguese sausage. 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros ($9.95) with potatoes (crunchy/green sauce). This was Ono! I really liked it a lot. The meat, beans, sauce and the crunchy tortilla complimented each other. 

One thing you have to try are there short stacks. I mean there name is baby stacks lol. We had to try one and we went with the orange creamsicle short stack. This was so good. I'm not a big sweets person but this one hit the spot. 

Would I come back? That's a yes! Go check them out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I love that Baby Stacks is a family owned business. They are obviously doing well since they now have 4 locations in town. I have heard nothing but good things about this place and was finally so excited to be able to try it. I was most looking forward to the famous babystack pancakes. I do think I will be the odd man out when I say that this place was just A-OK though.

The bf and I wandered in for a late brunch around 2pm, and we were seated right away. This place is super small, so I can see how there would be a wait during peak hours which is from 9a-12p Sat and Sun. They take to-go orders, but not during peak hours so be advised. They are open 7 days a week from 7a-2p on weekdays and 7a-3p on weekends. 

I ordered the loco moco with garlic fried rice (+$1) and for my side I upgraded to a small baby stack and got the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend had the piglet omelette with seasoned potatoes and toast. The loco moco is a Hawaiian dish which has 2 burger patties topped with 2 eggs and brown gravy, all sitting on a bed of rice. I loved the garlic fried rice, it was soo tasty and went well with the rest of my food. The burger patties were underseasoned, but the gravy was really flavorful and definitely made the dish come together. I tried the pancakes the minute they arrived at my table. This should be a dessert they were soo sweet. They were good though, but I didn't think they lived up to the hype. They were topped with whipped cream and cream cheese syrup which came in a little cup on the side. I did really enjoy the cream cheese syrup and found myself scraping the little cup to get the last bit of it onto my cakes. 

My boyfriend's omelette was 4 eggs stuffed with bacon, sausage, ham and cheddar. He also added jalapenos for a small charge. While it was plentiful, it was nothing memorable. It was $23 for both of us which I though was very reasonable. We only ordered waters though so drinks would have been a bit more. I plan to come back and try some other yummy pancake flavors, especially the lemon ricotta and the banana cream pie."}
{"text":"Ordered the Red Velvet short stack (comes with 3 pancakes) and the Eggs Benedict (not sure if I remember the name right).  

I was intrigued by the red velvet and was super excited to eat it, but it was too buttery for my taste.  Way heavy so I was only able to finish 1.  We got potatoes with our eggs Benedict and everything was good.  Egg was perfectly cooked/runny and the potato bites were crispy.  The only downside was there was too much cheese for my taste.  

I've got to say... Most restaurants I go to have funky smelling/tasting water (like they just run it from the sink) but the water here tasted fine and didn't smell at all.  The waitress was also super nice and attentive.  3 stars for food, but an extra star for the water and service.  Plus points for me!"}
{"text":"If you're a Hawaii native and looking for an island style breakfast this is the place to go. Adobo fried rice, loco mocos, chili mocos, Portuguese sausage all done right, and if you want a local twist try the kalua pork Benedict.  Added bonus...they're all served with aloha \000/"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for breakfast. I wasn't a big fan of all the pancake flavors. Too sweet for breakfast I think. The non-sweet dishes were pretty good and I'd come back for those and just get a regular stack if I ever come back."}
{"text":"Lemon Ricotta Pancakes !!! 
That is all - 5/5

Came here with a group of friends before trekking up to Mt. Charleston. Pancakes were amazing... Light, tart and sweet .. Reminds me of a lemon cake A+ in my book! Service was attentive ."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, exemplary service, and friendly staff.  I had Lolo Rick's adobo omelette for breakfast.   Why no one thought of this before is crazy.   It is out of this world!  Our waitress Lindsey was sweet and got us everything we needed.  Even got some soy sauce I didn't know I needed."}
{"text":"First time today, glad we were finally able to get in! Food was very good and the best part is that it wasn't trying to be all foodie, it was all just straight forward good breakfast food. Everything we had was good and filling. We will 100% be back again! Prepare for a wait when you go - it's that popular."}
{"text":"So my mother had heard great reviews about this place and I have to say it did not live up to the reviews. I was expected these fancy pancakes but got the normal buttermilk pancakes with toppings. The service was subpar I sat without a drink and silverware for a while. I actually got up and got the silverware from another table. 
Overall the food was just ok normal breakfast food. The lunch food looked like it would be good maybe next time."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  We ordered the adobo fried rice omelet, mac nut pancake, red velvet pancake, chili loco moco and sweet cream crepe.  All tasted really good.  The chili tasted like zippy's chili and the adobo fried rice was filled with chunks of pork adobo. Once we walked in, it smelled like my kitchen when I cook breakfast! 

Service was very attentive and we were checked on frequently despite the crowd.  
Thrilled we live near this location!"}
{"text":"So my mom and I were looking for a great, inexpensive brunch spot on our way out of town. We read all these reviews on yelp about the pancakes. So we chose this place. It was also my mom's birthday... I love everything red velvet and had to have the pancakes, however the Cinnabon ones were also ones we wanted to try. So we got short stacks of both. In addition we split the Spinach and Bacon Eggs Benedict. The Benedict came with a choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. I am pretty sure that most of the food is typical Sysco food, I'm not even sure the hollandaise is freshly made. With that said however, the Benedict was delicious. I ate one potato and pushed them aside, should have ordered the hash browns. We did have a ton of food though so it wasn't like I was starving for more food. 
Now to the pancakes. I made the mistake of not telling our server to put everything on the side as they put so much whipped cream(fresh homemade) and powdered sugar and some chocolate dust. I removed all the toppings and went for the bottom one. I liked the pancake, it was cooked perfectly, super fluffy and warm. I was not so thrilled with the \"icing\" it needed more of a cream cheese flavor because it settled at the bottom. I liked it but I didn't love it. I had a bite of the Cinnabon pancake, although too sweet for me I liked it better. It didn't need any syrup because it had the icing already on it and the pecans made it crunchy and perfect. Again it was a perfectly cooked pancake. 
My mom would give this place 4... And a 5 just for the pancakes. I can't. Looking around at the egg dishes, they looked so generic and again, like Sysco food products. 
I'd say if you want fantastic pancakes go there, but if you want eggs then pass."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. Im a huge breakfast fan and pancakes and sweet breakfasts are my specialty. My sister ordered crepes and and got the cookie butter french toast and I didnt want it to end!! My mom ordered the red velvet pancakes and thought they were very thick but dry when I tried hers I totally agrees. Im happy with what I've ordered."}
{"text":"It's a shame because the food is decent but their customer service sucks. I brought two friends that are new to the place and it was a disaster. They took 40 minutes to seat us and we were all present. Finally we sat down ready to order after looking at the menu for 40 minutes. Then the waitress refused to take our food order and only wanted our drinks because she had \"other tables she had to take their orders first\". She wasn't able to refill coffee in a timely manner. Our food took a really long time. I was so embarrassed. 
I came back with my aunt hoping they just had a bad day and it happened again, they sat down a bunch of people that walked in after us. Her toddler was hungry and getting cranky. Finally a nice family that clearly seen us sitting their before them was about to be seated and told the host to seat us first because we were there first. 
Awful customer service!"}
{"text":"Baby Stacks is a breakfast spot, with a generous selection of \"yummy\" pancakes and a strong Hawaiian influence. Their portion sizes are smaller than other restaurants, but their prices are higher. I've eaten here a few times, but never been blown away with the food or service. 

They appeal to the Hawaiian/Filipino market specifically, with staples like garlic rice and Portuguese sausage. FYI, if you plan on interacting with ANYONE after eating here - do not order the garlic rice. You could murder a vampire with your breath.

The \"star\" of this joint are the pancakes, which come in short stacks. They have a myriad of flavors and toppings, most of which carry an artificial candy-like flavor. Do not expect leftovers, as stated before the portion sizes are significantly smaller than what you would expect from the price. 

I'm not an advocate of huge portions, quite the opposite. But i am a cost sensitive consumer, who can see value in quality or quantity. Neither of these metrics are met to justify menu pricing here.

Baby Stacks is a classic example of current Las Vegas local cuisine, shameless appeal to a niche market and no single item is exceptional."}
{"text":"Great service. Adobo Fried Rice Omlete was delicious.  The restaurant itself is a bit small, but since it's breakfast, table turnover is pretty fast. My boyfriend got the Sausage & Egg breakfast which also came with hashbrowns and 2 buttermilk pancakes. It was good, but maybe we needed to get a different pancake dish."}
{"text":"Went there with my friend for the first time and OMG I can't believe I've never heard of this place before. I had the Cinnabon short stack with the Kahlua Pork Eggs Benedict, my friend had the Red Velvet short stack and the Fried Rice Omelet. Everything was absolutely delicious! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great experience. We got the banana foster pancakes and can you say heaven in your mouth. It was like eating a fluffy banana sugar cloud. Also got the piglet omelette. Mmmmm mmmm good. After eating here I probably look like a pig lol. Great place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"the food is great and the waitresses are amazing and super friendly.  I highly recommend this place. the Loco moco is really good and the red velvet pancakes and German chocolate pancakes are the best."}
{"text":"Our family and my husbands family sides love this place, friendly staff and good food. But we just found out that they don't do anything special for birthdays. I asked if they can have one candle on a stack of pancakes for my son's birthday, but sadly they don't do anything as that they said. Hopefully one day they would, it would be nice for customers. So instead I took a picture of my son's order and got a little creative that way I can still add it to our album"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I absolutely love Babystacks.. But the one on flamingo by the DMV. I have been to this location twice and only gotten pick up. The restaurant is rather small and cramped. Both times it was the same host guy, who just was a bit rude, never smiled at customers. 

But now that it's so close to my house, I can get the awesome red velvet pancakes / and adobo fried rice whenever I want. So I guess the bad service is a small price to pay to get those foods. 

Oh and I've tried calling the # on Yelp, and it doesn't connect , I tried calling the # on a little whiteboard they have and no one picks up as well. So good luck trying to get ahold of them! Lol"}
{"text":"This place isn't what it used to be, I was always a huge fan of this particular location. I'm not sure if they changed management recently since everything is done different. The staff isn't as friendly, the food is no longer as delicious and the rules like their newest about splitting the bill is ridiculous. Definitely will miss this place but I'll no longer be a client."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby and two young kids. I wouldn't describe our interaction with the hostess warm and friendly. When we asked for waters, they were giant cups-which was fine for the adults, but way too big for two little kids. Not to mention they didn't have lids on them. Of course one of the kids spilled their water. The cups were too large for them to handle. My son loved his pancakes, but the rest of us felt the food was just okay. We were unimpressed with our visit there."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I had the cowboy skillet with bananas foster pancakes. The pancakes were to die for flavor was phenomenal.  Very attentive good service highly recommend"}
{"text":"Seriously off the hook grinds! Portions are on point. Our server Joey provided the best customer service ever! Very knowledgeable about the menu, made the perfect recommendations, patient with our decisions, always with a smile! Will be back, will recommend!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype of the red velvet pancakes: fluffy, buttery, and richly chocolate based with a delicious cream cheese frosting.

I also tried the portugese sausage and eggs breakfast. The sausage was excellent. Be sure to get the garlic rice for an additional $1. It is rice with the essence of garlic and chopped onions in it.

The coffee was also great. Overall, a great option for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Very happy and very fast staff - Food was fine, but not over the top. The restaurant is small, so there was a wait - but when we proposed sitting outside, they happily allowed and we were served immediately. Everyone raved about their pancakes - and they were OK, but nothing that special in my mind. .... a fun little place to visit..."}
{"text":"Babystacks and I have a love-hate relationship. Actually, it's mostly love. I just HATE the fact that this delicious breakfast place is literally ONE MINUTE from my house while I'm on this dreaded diet! Other than that, it's also love that it's so close. 

From the outside, this place doesn't look like much. In fact, I was never curious about what this place was until my bestie invited me here for breakfast. BUT, as soon as you step in, you seriously feel like a character on Animal Crossing. The inside is SHO CUTE! It has an adorable and homey ambience that I just love! The service was also great and friendly! 

If you're looking for a great breakfast/brunch I suggest opting out for the skillets! They have so many combinations and possibilities for them. They also come with pancakes that you can replace with special pancakes for only ONE DOLLAH! I know that everyone talks about their Red Velvet pancakes, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolatey goodness first thing in the morning (ironic I know). Instead, I am in love with their CARROT PANCAKES! Give them a chance! They are delish! I always ask for the cream-cheese syrup on the side. They are fluffy and cooked to absolute perfection. Their BANANA CREAM pancakes are also delicious! It tastes just like an actual banana cream pie (amazing I know). 

As a huge fan of french toast, I'm definitely looking forward to trying it here on my next visit! If you're looking for a great little breakfast place, BabyStacks is the way to go! I always leave here with a food coma!"}
{"text":"The wait was really long and I was hopeful. I had I think a Mexican skillet which was just ok. I would have given this place 3 stars, except the pancakes I got as a side were AMAZING. I think every main dish comes with small pancakes on the side (hence, the name). I had the lemon ricotta pancakes which was so freaking good. I'd return and just order pancakes."}
{"text":"Craving pancakes? This is the place to come. Yelpers are right on with the red velvet pancakes...it's like dessert for breakfast. The adobo fried rice omelette is good 3/5, but as for me and my sweet tooth...the pancakes win hands down. We also tried the banana creme pie and lemon ricotta stack...while they were both good in their own right...red velvet is a classic and favorite."}
{"text":"I love that this place has Hawaiian-style choices, even Aloha Shoyu at the table! My family from NY (originally from Hawaii) loved it.  I got the Sausage Biscuit Benedict and the Orange Creamsicle Pancakes. Both were great, but the pancakes were amazing! IT was citrus-y and sweet (not too sweet) with a orange syrup and cream cheese sauce, just like a dreamsicle. It would be hard for me to go back and pick a different pancake, although there are so many to choose from! Must-try when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"On my visit in Vegas I stopped here for breakfast. I ordered the Piglet Skillet that came with ham, sausage, bacon, and potatoes. I added spinach, onions, and tomato (extra charge). The skillet also came with pancakes.

The piglet skillet was delicious, but considering the restaurant is known for pancakes, I was a little disappointed that the pancakes had no flavor at all. I recommend trying the skillets or omelets with a side of toast instead of pancakes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots in town. This was my first time at this location and I was very disappointed in how my experience was handled. The staff was very friendly and most of the food was amazing as usual. I ordered steak and eggs and asked for a medium steak. When my order came out the steak was definitely not medium but I tried a few pieces anyways to see if I could eat it but it was tough and well done so I asked the server to take it back. He came back and said the middle of the steak had pink in it but he could make me another. So I decided to take it back and try it. The server was right there was SOME pink in the middle but the entire steak was over cooked. I didn't want to wait again for another platter to be ordered so I just decided not to eat it. When I asked for the item to be taken off the bill bc it wasn't eaten he said no because he offered to make me another one. I work in customer service and I was so disappointed how the situation was handled. I wasn't trying to be difficult but if I legitimately wasn't happy for the item and didn't even touch it I shouldn't have had to pay for it. I'm definitely not anticipating eating at this restaurant again any time soon."}
{"text":"Every time I stop here on vacay I try a different pancake and seriously I have never been disappointed in my choice! I always have the Portuguese sausage, eggs, and garlic rice. This time I tried the carrot pancakes and they were perfect with the right amount of spice and not too sweet. Service is quick and efficient. Just wish the place was a little bigger in size."}
{"text":"I love pancakes!! I consider that to be my soul food. My goal in life is to search for extraordinary pancakes where ever I go. As we were planning our trip to vegas, I had to search for pancakes places and found this gem. Upon entering the place, it looks small yet cozy. We were seated right away and gave our orders. I ordered the banana pancakes and my friend ordered the omelette with potatoes. I was in heaven as I was eating the pancakes. You have the option of a full order or short order. I can only handle the short order which comes in 3 pieces of pancakes. The banana pancakes was very flavorful. I was able to finish my food. I will definitely be back. Can't wait to try their other pancakes. Too bad they close at 3pm. I would have gone here for dinner. Anyway I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Looking for a new place for breakfast, we stumbled upon this restaurant. This has become one of our favorite places for breakfast. We make sure to take everyone that comes to visit. I have yet to be disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, went on a Saturday at 12 and seated almost immediately. Server was nice and checked on our table very often. 

Food was divine. My girlfriend and I ordered the mocha pancake, red velvet, the honey toast and the traditional eggs Benedict. 
The mocha pancake was too chocolat-y for my taste but my girlfriend loved it. Eggs were cooked to perfection. 

Only real complaint I have for this place was that I found a small hair in my pancakes, but this didn't bother me too much. 
When the servers came around with the food. The plates are held on top of the food and touching the food. The bottom of the plate is touching the food, which could potentially impose a health problem. The bottom of the plates sit on dirty counters, so seeing that they stack the plates on top of the food that is served to customers disgusted me."}
{"text":"For breakfast places, this is a top favorite. This is one of those restaurants that will get you hooked after your first time. All the pancakes are amazing. The Mexican skillet is by far my favorite breakfast dish. I give them 5 stars based on the food alone. Sometimes the wait can be very long but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I usually avoid this place on the weekends because it's become everyone's go-to brunch spot, but today I came in and it wasn't too crowded. I always love coming to BabyStacks. It's close to my house and the food always gets you full. You'll even leave with left overs. 

What I ordered: I love to get the Adobo Fried Rice and upgrade to garlics rice as well as upgrade my pancakes to the Banana Fosters! Those pancakes are the best I've ever had. Ive always wished to find a place where the banana in the pancake doesn't taste fake. I love it. The pancakes come out warm with sauce and whipped cream right on top. The adobo fried rice is so perfect! It's not too salty and it's great with a little bit of ketchup! 

I always recommend this place to so many people, I guess that's why it just keeps getting busier and busier"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I'm always happy to support a small business that was no fuss, no muss. It's relieving to be somewhere that isn't putting on airs or is super trendy from time to time. Just a great local joint for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Hello. My name is Melanie, and I am a pancake addict.

Awe, why so serious? Being addicted to pancakes isn't so bad. I mean, so long as I don't let it get out of control. It's not like I eat pancakes for dinner...regularly. And I totally don't own pancake batter in a spray-can form. And I DEFINITELY have never argued with a McDonald's clerk because they wouldn't serve me a Hotcakes 'n Sausage platter a measly five minutes after breakfast ended. Never.

Okay, you got me. I may be fibbing a little. The truth is that I have a hard time saying no to pancakes. I could be wish-I-wore-my-stretchy-pants full, and if a warm stack of fluffy flapjacks somehow landed on my table - well, let's just say I wouldn't let it go to waste.

And so you can imagine what a pancake café would be like for me. Tummy temptation at its finest! Babystacks boasts the most ridiculously extensive selection of pancakes I have ever had the pleasure of choosing from. Red Velvet...Cinnabun...White Chocolate Macadamia Nut...Rocky Road - their pancake list reads more like a dessert menu! For those who seek savory over sweet? BACON pancakes! And even a Honey Whole Wheat option for the carb-conscious. 

The best part? Each is available as a short stack of three pancakes. Translation? You can order like THREE different kinds without busting your pancake bank!

I played it cool and ordered just two flavors - the PB & Banana and the Red Velvet.  The PB & Banana was definitely the frontrunner of the two, with banana as the perfect complement to the unmistakably peanut-buttery batter. Simple, yet such a mouth-pleaser! The Red Velvet did quite well in its pancake debut, served with a delightful 'cream cheese syrup.' Though I would have done without the chocolate crumble topping -- it was an unnecessary distraction from the decadent-on-its-own batter. 

Bottom Line:  The perfect place for feeding your flapjack fetish! Short-stacks are your best bet for maximum pancake sampling. Beware the long wait for a table -- especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Service could've been better if our waitress was more friendly. Food was okay. I would probably just go there for the red velvet pancakes. I'm not a fan of pancakes or sweet things so I imagined it to be very sweet but it wasn't. I tried the spam scramble with garlic rice which was okay. Ricks adobo fried rice was bland. The rice had no taste. The ranchero omelette had the most flavor out of all the plates which was mainly due to the sauce, but it was good."}
{"text":"Love their food. The only complaint I have is trying to order food for pickup. Every time I've tried to order over the phone on Sunday, I get a busy signal. I've literally called from outside and no one is on the phone. It looks like they leave it off the hook."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated.  My boyfriend and I each ordered a skillet. I got the veggie skillet and he ordered the meat lovers skillet. They were okay. My biggest complaints are the amount of time it took to receive our food and the portion sizes were extremely small for the price paid. We haven't returned."}
{"text":"LOOOVE baby stacks! Love the atmosphere and the people here! Great food.. I always get the loco moco with chilli.. YUUM and cinabon pancakes.. Can't go wrong!! Will ways come back here!"}
{"text":"Ranchero Skillet is the best thing here along with all the fun pancakes. I've tried almost all of them and they are all good. Great portions too, not too much so you aren't too full walking out. One of my fav breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and my husband and I stopped in here to try it out based on Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. The pancakes were out of this world! Very delicious. Our server was a really nice person and we enjoyed the visit. Make sure to ask for room temperature butter though. Cold butter and hotcakes do not mix."}
{"text":"I think I'd heard too much about BabyStacks before visiting, so my expectations were WAY too high! However, that's not to say that it was a bad experience by any stretch. I just should have stuck to my initial thought and either ordered the Red Velvet or Carrot Cake pancakes instead of the Cinnamon Roll. They were good, just not great. It took awhile to get to the cinnamon- for awhile I felt like they were just regular pancakes.

The service was friendly, and coffee was refilled frequently. They do very brisk business, so you'll likely have a wait if you visit on a weekend. Prices were very fair- 2 people can eat well for $20."}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast and lunch spot to go to. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The prices are very affordable.

I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs with hash browns and Cinnabon pancakes. The whole dish was a bit under seasoned so I had to add my own salt. The pancakes were delicious and very well made.

My fiance ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs with garlic fried rice and red velvet pancakes. Again the dish was a bit on the bland side, but the pancakes were amazing! 

My only real concern is that we had ordered a 3$ cup of orange juice, and it turns out it was an orange juice concentrate so it didn't taste good. I would have really loved to have fresh squeezed orange juice.

With that said I will be coming back here some time in the future."}
{"text":"2 words:  truly bad!
My fellow yelpers have never let me down before, so I was so ready to eat here.  All these fantastic 5 star reviews had to be dead on, right?  I looove a good breakfast place and enjoy supporting, local mom and pop family type operations, so I was definitely looking forward to naming Babycakes as my new b'fast/brunch stop.  Never mind.

So awful all the way around that I will not even go into all the details.  The entire experience was a loss - it started from the indifferent greeting (barely a look up in our direction from the hostess at the podium/cashier desk in front) followed with painstaking slow service and then topped off with cold, rubbery food thrown on a plate.  The bad service was not offset by the equally poor food, or vice versa.

And what is with the grunge/slime in the iced tea!  How hard is it to brew tea?  That should have been my sign to leave befor even attemtping to eat.  Bad, bad!"}
{"text":"It was 4th of July, wait was about 30 mins at 10:30am, definitely Cafe space since we were elbow to elbow in the inside wait area.  Smiles were abundant during our visit and service was great though!  We gave the Portuguese sausage and Corned beef hash meals w/eggs over med a try - with an upgraded order of garlic rice in lieu of potatoes.  We also upgraded to Red Velvet pancakes and Lemon Ricotta crepes in lieu of the buttermilk/toast that is included in the Breakfast Favs on the menu.  We came back 3 more times during our 1week stay in Vegas - we just wanted to try the other menu goodies and we loved all of it!"}
{"text":"I have tried the North Side cafe and these were both equally delicious. The Adobo rice was hot and fresh. It was a bit salty, but I expect that in an Adobo dish. The red velvet pancakes were sweet and rich, not too sweet.
The wait however can be long, so expect that. The server checked on us a few times, but we did have to ask for water. The flow of the cafe was not good, it was cramped and the seating was not enough room for all 7 of us (we are not huge people,) but we made do.
I am rating this a 3 because although the food was good, service and space provided could of been better."}
{"text":"The service is quick and they are extremely friendly;) even when there is a wait your really not waiting that long. I LOVE BABYSTACKS!!!!"}
{"text":"No one does red velvet pancakes like BabyStacks! No one..........the Kalua Pork Benedict is also quite delicious.
 
Now that they Have two locations it really cuts down the wait  

I would eat here every week if i lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"Such a delicious spot for brunch! The prices are reasonable and the wait didn't take too long. I can't wait to go back and try other specialties! 

*They only seat you if your whole party is present"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. Wait time for table was 15 min shorter than they told us. But, the coffee was horrible. Hopefully won't be hard to fix that."}
{"text":"Fast service friendly waitress.  Pancakes are to die for.  Small and quaint.  A real neighborhood place.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem! Out of the ordinary breakfast options- such as Loco Moco and Kalbi short ribs with garlic rice is delicious!
We are new to the area and this is our go to breakfast place!
Super pilot and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"#BabyStacksCafe #LasVegas \"Bacon Pancakes & Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette\":  Yo!  TIME.  OUT.  Wait!  I'm goin' straight to the point, nah'imsayin'?  I ordered the short stack version of the bacon pancakes b, and yo' I thought they tried to play me son!  So they gave me the short stack, 3 pancakes nahmean?  I'm like cool, and then they had 2 ripped pieces of bacon floatin' on top yo like somebody bit my bacon and left me the fat part.  The FAT part son!  I'm like, yo I thought the menu said bacon infused pancakes b!?  I didn't see no bacon bits creatively infused into the pancake son, matter of fact, I'm glad I didn't complain off top!  Because they did have bacon in the pancakes but it was one whole piece per pancake like as if they cooked one side, waited 3 minutes, threw a piece of bacon on it, flipped it, then cooked it another 3 minutes.  And my bacon was mad chewy son! C'mon son!  If it's Filipino inspired, you know we like our shits crispy b!  Almost burnt to the point where it gets a little ashy nahmean!?  It felt like I was eatin' rubber pancakes with a toy piece of bacon I got from my youngn's fake stove, you understand?  Anyway, I ate it all, cause I was hungry.  Good thing my main event came through tho.  The Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was right on the money.  I wish they gave me more macaroni salad tho son, they gave me a baby scoop b.  I'm 26 years old fam!  You can't give me the baby scoop with the adult main event son.  I ate that shit in one bite and had nothin' else to off set the adobo flavor.  But yo, I ain't even tryna play this place son, because I saw some other shit on the menu that was probably way better than what I got.  I'm also Filipino, so grabbin' some Filipino food probably wasn't the best idea because my moms be makin' that shit since I was 3 yo, so I'm not really impressed by it nahmean?  All in all, if you tryna impress a shorty yo, do NOT take her here unless you don't care about her or you live 5 minutes away and she says \"If you buy me breakfast, I'll tickle your fancy\".  That's the only time you take a broad here yo.  Anyway, yo the waiter was cool, had my water filled up before I had to ask so you know I was pretty satisfied.  But overall I give this place a 3 out of 7 rating b.  #MoochEats"}
{"text":"This is definitely me and my boyfriends go to breakfast spot! It's a small homey breakfast location with a wide range of pancakes but since I'm not a pancake person myself and I've been on a skillet kick for a while me and my boyfriend both got the Mexican skillet  it contains carnitas, potatoes, pepper jack cheese, jalapeños, sour cream, pico de Gallo and it wouldn't be a skillet with out eggs and my daughter got the kids French toast it comes with potatoes on the side, I wanted to substitute the potatoes for bacon because my daughter really wanted bacon but unfortunately they couldn't so I had to order her a side of bacon and strawberry's(she really wanted strawberry on her French toast) both side being about $3 each besides that most pricing is reasonable. I always enjoy the food here and usually receive great customer service but there a very popular spot so they get really busy and I don't like how the tables are all crammed together so close and in this particular visit they decided to seat us on a bar area which was fine but then I realized there's no elbow space which makes it uncomfortable to eat but all and all it's a good place to try out I definitely will be coming back here again"}
{"text":"The service was good, food was up quick and everything tasted great! The prices aren't bad at all but there are always a ton of kids which isn't exactly what my hubs and I want to hear when we end up there trying to cure a hangover.  The red velvet pancakes are more of a dessert than a breakfast. I like the peanut butter banana pancakes the best. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars, everything flowed. Melanie (our server), was very friendly, polite, and highly attentive.  Great 1st time. Oh, did I mention they were playing Reggae music as well! Where else can you get great cooking, as well as great music playing that won't bore you?  I'll be back next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"IN NO WAY AM I SAYING THE FOOD IS NOT DELICIOUS... BUT THE SERVICE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. 

Normally I go to the Smoke Ranch location but I was on my lunch break for work. I have never had a single bad experience till today. I ordered the Chili Moco, new item on the the menu and it sounded interesting. Came out barely warm. Waiter not in sight for quiet some time. My  daughter who I was having lunch with had to go to the bathroom. Cant put off a toddler going to the bathroom, so we got up and went. By the time we got back, my food was ICE COLD. I could see why since the restaurant was FREEZING.
 I Finally got the waiter and informed him of the situation. He did ask if I would like it heated up ( microwaved eggs... YUCK!) or remade. I let him know I was on my lunch and had to get back. My family was already finished with their meal by this time. I was a little upset to see that I was charged for a) something I did not consume and b) something that was not to my satisfaction.  After further talking to a \"Manager\", I was told that it was my fault the food was cold and that they normally don't take items off but this will be a one time thing. Like really? It was my fault the food was barely warm to begin with and I don't have the time to wait for them to make me another dish. I inform my server as soon as he was around. I did my end, sorry I was an inconvenience. Never have I felt so talked down to for something I have no control over."}
{"text":"Cute location,  great food.  It looks super small and busy,  but we didn't wait too long for a table.  It was worth it,  because the food and service was great. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast! If you like pancakes, this is definitely a must try. They also make a great adobo friend rice wrapped in egg, and being from Hawaii, I know what good adobo fried rice is, and this I must say is right up there with what we have back in the islands. Customer service is great as well, and service is fast and efficient. Atmosphere is very relaxed, with some soothing Hawaiian music. Must try spot when you're in Vegas! Gotta thank my boy Chris for the great recommendation."}
{"text":"i have had gastric sleeve surgery. they let me order off the kids portion menu which is awesome. most restaurants wont allow me to do that."}
{"text":"Smaller cafe style breakfast spot a little wait but not  an excruciatingly long one. The staff here are well versed in how to make this place work with the high volume of people who want to eat here. We got the Hawaiian Benedict which was a tad salty but that's spam for you. Strawberry short stack and a Cinnabon BabyStacks. Very good food!! Even my daughter stated 5 stars and she's picky with seasoning and texture of food. Waitress had many tables was still able to check in on us and take time with our order. We'd pick this place over the later ihop down the street."}
{"text":"Strengths:

The ambience is very cheerful.  It feels like it's always spring in there, even if it were the dead of winter.  The space is plentiful and well decorated.  The TVs are a nice touch.  It's clean and has an overall pleasant atmosphere. 

The food was delicious, living up to the expectations set by the other two locations.  The bacon was thick and crispy.  The garlic fried rice was an excellent complement.  The hazelnut pancakes had a well-balanced flavor, and will be a hit for Nutella fans. 

Area of opportunity:

The food came out a little late, so there needs to be some fine tuning with the process."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this little spot! I went with the Banana Fosters Full Stack and the wife went with the German Chocolate Short Stack. 

They were absolutely delicious. Also got the Hawaiian style sausage they serve.

Small restaurant with a real locals place kinda feel. 

The service was excellent just like you'd expect at a place like this. 

You will definitely not be disappointed. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Rick's Adobo fried rice was the bomb!!! Great service. Support local anytime the food is this good!!!"}
{"text":"Very good for better than your local IHOP or dennys by far. Tons of menu items and big portions . Kids menu was a little small could of offers just pancakes and bacon but nothing to gripe about . And my biscuits were somewhat stale . But if that's all there is to complain about they are doing awesome and price is for sure. I will be back time and time again !!"}
{"text":"Greatly little breakfast place. Nice variety on the menu, everyone got what they wanted. Service was great and we even enjoyed our servers pink plume hair style. Will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"If ever you're in Vegas, you HAVE to drive off the strip and try this place. Everyone's already said it: Red Velvet Panckes ftw! It's a pretty small place but the quality of the food was amazing. Along with the Red Velvet pancakes we ordered the Carrot Cake pancakes and Almond Joy Pancakes with a side of hash browns. The carrot cake pancake is exactly what it sounds, it was just like eating a slice of carrot cake. Pretty delish.. the Almond Joy pancake was a little overwhelming. I think that flavor should stay with the chocolate bar alone. We had a 45 min wait, the service was good and fast. They have such a diverse selection for pancakes its amazing but if you're feeling overwhelmed just try the red velvet, you can't go wrong! They serve the pancakes half stack and full stack. Half stack is 3 pancakes and full is 6. Not sure who can eat a full stack but kudos to you. This is definitely one of those places you kinda have to try once."}

{"text":"OMG, I am not a pancake eating type person. Nothing about it sounds good. When my family decided to eat at a place called babystacks I was not too thrilled. When we got there we were told it was going to be a 35 minute wait. The crazy thing is it's a Thursday morning. I wanted to use that as an excuse to leave. My family still wanted to wait. To my surprise five minutes later we were being seated.

I decided to try the corned beef hash with seasoned potatoes and red velvet pancakes(I was really living on the edge). Again OMG, AMAZING I was pleasantly surprised on how awesome everything was. Seasoned to perfection. I don't like breakfast nor do I like pancakes. I know where I will be next time anyone suggest breakfast. Everything was so good and we all loved our food. Noone in my family could complain about anything and that is unusual for us. I could see why on a Thursday it would be such a wait."}
{"text":"I don't know why people line up and wait for food here, nothing really stands out. My food was too greasy and had no flavor in  it and service was too slow. I felt robbed and I wasted too much time waiting just get a cup of coffee and after that another 30 minutes for food, what a joke."}
{"text":"This place is incredible, been here 10+ times and has been awesome everything single time. Waitstaff is great and attentive, and their orange cream pancakes are like crack! Always worth the wait.
  My fav is the Ranchero Skillet-New Mexico green chile is abundant in this one - perfect:) 
 Added bonus for me is Reggae playlist airing in the background.."}
{"text":"The food is amazing ! The food deserves five stars , but it's tiny & you're basically squished . Wait is from 15-30 minutes long   Because its always full ."}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself for never being to this place after all the times I've been to Vegas! 

This is definitely a must when you're in town. 

Tons of dishes to choose from and all will make you full.. Easy to get to this place is honestly a great gem hidden in the desert. 

The servers are friendly and accommodating. 

There are only a few seats so get here early to avoid a long wait. 

Parking does get packed so carpool if you can. 

If you're on the strip it'll take you about 15 minutes without traffic. 

Trust me... This place is a must! 

Try their fresh squeezed juice with any of their specialties. 

Be sure to tip well."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time and loved that there wasn't an hour and a half wait! 

Their service was excellent and their food was again... Amazing! This time I felt a bit more fancy sitting at the bar on the elegant countertop instead of a dining table. 

Let me mention that my wife isn't really a breakfast person but she actually liked her meal... 

I had a strawberry lemonade and ordered the spam and egg meal with an upgrade to their garlic fried rice - which is a must.  To top everything off and to ensure I was full of carbs, I chose the simple pancakes with maple syrup.

My wife and a more colorful choice which included avocado and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes. They tasted as good as they looked. 

I can see why this place has won many awards within Vegas. They'll be opening another location in April further south near Henderson so waits so start to drop. 

If you're in Vegas and not feeling a buffet for breakfast, this place is for you. 

You'll come hungry and leave full without breaking the bank. 

Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for breakfast and often bring out of town guests. On weekends, you may have to wait, but it's worth it if you're craving good pancakes! The pancakes are their specialty, and for good reason-- their batter is excellent, and that's what makes an awesome pancake. Their fancy pancakes are just a further demonstration of how really awesome this place is. I can recommend personally the red velvet, cinnabun, carrot cake, bacon and buttermilk pancakes (I wasn't lying when I said we've been here several times!) Their other dishes are quit good too-- I have enjoyed their skillet breakfast and California omelet; by far I was least impressed with their benedicts, but we come here for the PANCAKES, and you should, too!"}
{"text":"We have gone at least 3 times on a Sunday morning and they are usually pretty packed.  We haven't had to wait very long.  I LOVE the German chocolate pancakes!  I think the food is slightly above average, but where they are way above average is the pancakes!  There are so many fun flavors to choose from.  The red velvet are also really tasty.  We usually get a breakfast plate (eggs or omelet) with a side of pancakes and we never can finish it all.  Lots of food!  Unique and delish!"}
{"text":"I love babystacks but today was horrible !!! Today i ordered a BYO skillet with bananas pancakes like always and first i get my skillet with unseasoned potatoes, they take back the skillet and bring out my banana pancakes. After my first bite out of the pancakes i taste batter and look down and see that my pancake in uncooked. The waiter took the pancakes and came back with my skillet and once i started to enjoy my food they bought out me a fresh order of pancakes to only cut in them and have the same thing happen again the pancakes were uncooked. I couldnt even eat my skillet because my whole stomach was turned after being served my favorite thing about babystacks eating pancakes and what they r well known for."}
{"text":"Food is good service is pretty ok as long as they're not slammed. Be sure you're entire party is here before you sit because they will not seat an incomplete group. The dining room and tables are pretty tiny.  I like the variety of breakfast items and specialty pancakes."}
{"text":"excellent food, exceptional staff, reasonable prices.... really good local place to have breakfast... will stop in here everytime i'm in henderson...try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My order was prepared wrong so they took it of the bill, but then still charged me for the side that was supposed to be part of my meal. I find that tacky. They should take the time to get my order right the first time and then at least make it right when they don't. They do have a great menu, if only they could just prepare as requested."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Being from Hawaii it is a sweet reminder of home, think Cinnamons, yum! They have an extensive list of specialty pancakes, including a white chocolate macadamia but one. I've tried a few and you can't go wrong! Very well priced. Around $8 for two egg breakfast including potatoes or hash and a speciality stack of pancakes. Good portion sizes - I always leave feeling stuffed!"}
{"text":"Wow, those red velvet pancakes made me register here on Yelp so I could give them a review. Was quite reluctant first about these pancake flavors they offer but me and wifey decided to try it. Luckily the first 2 times we went there, no lines. Anyway, tried the Red Velvet Pancakes and Eggs Benedict made us instant believers of this place. The servers are also great and efficient and not too pushy. Food was served immediately even if you waited a long time for an open table. Also tried the Adobo Fried Rice, White Chocolate Pancakes, Carrot Cake Pancakes eventually on the succeeding visits and haven't been disappointed, not one bit or one time. Folks, try this place, it's definitely breakfast heaven!"}
{"text":"Wow, this location is finally open after waiting for seemed like forever. Same old good dishes served on the other locations like Rick's Adobo fied Rice, Kahlua Pig Benedict and especially the Red Velvet Pancakes. They are still trying to operate as normal as possible but still the service is still good."}
{"text":"I think the food at babystacks is very good but I have a big issue with the establishment. They won't seat you unless your entire party is there. I understand that this makes sense in case a person gets seated at a bigger table and then the rest of their party doesn't arrive until much later which could cause wait times to lengthen. However, sometimes people only have an hour lunch and if one of the party their meeting up with is able to go early and order everyone's food so it's on the table by the time everyone else gets there then what's wrong with that? All the food is being ordered at the same time! Especially for a small party of three which would not take a big table even if the rest of the party got held up and didn't show all the food would have still gotten paid for. Also, if your establishment is doing so well that you have to have this unpleasant policy bc of all the people that want to eat your food then get a bigger establishment. Babystacks is no hole in the wall even tourists go there. It would be a nice place for an afternoon brunch when family or out of town friends are here except that it is so small. I really like the food at this place but today they made me feel like they were too good to work with me and my situation. When I called the girl who answered the phone said it was the manager's call and when I asked to speak with the manager she said, \"Well he's busy if you wanna hold it would be awhile.\" Just disappointing service."}
{"text":"This place has my favorite pancakes. The two different types of lemon pancakes are my favorites and the red velvet ones were to die for. The service is always great and it's always busy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally found a morning to try Babystacks Cafe. This place is much more than just breakfast and pancakes. There were so many options. I went for the classic chicken fried steak with eggs, hash browns, and a couple of pancakes. 
I'll be back to try one of the fancy stacks. And maybe one of the skillets. 

If you haven't tried Babystacks give them a try.

Also I love the decor. The hand burnt pine wood makes it feel very cozy. But watch the tables. They need a wider footing I watched a couple of tables almost flip on there side."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place!!  Had there Mexican skillet with a short stack of the banana cream pie cakes (way big portion for a short stack) both were delicious.  My wife had the Cinnabun regular stack ( it was big enough for a family of 4) but it was really great.

Service was 5 stars (really quick and very attentive) and so was the price."}
{"text":"This place is where my friends and I go to after a fun-filled morning hike. It has become a tradition to come this establishment and we truly enjoy the service and food.

They're always busy, and there's never a time when we came where they weren't. They don't seat incomplete parties nor do they split checks so be prepared (there's always Venmo or Cash App). Anyways, the wait is usually anywhere between 10 to 30 mins, which really isn't that bad. The wait gets us quite excited because just thinking of what we will order from the many different items on their menu can take a while to decide. But overall, whatever you choose.. This place will definitely fill you up! The servers are quite attentive, sometimes there's a rush so once in a while you need to get their attention, but other than that, you'll feel satisfied after taking those first couple of bites of food.

My friends and I always order something savory and upgrade to one of their specialty short stacks, which is definitely plentiful.

Lastly, we love the island fusion and music! Having lived in Maui for a few years, and having a step-father raised on the island of Oahu, it definitely brings me back to a sunny day at the beach."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive. The strawberry pancakes I had were delicious! I would definitely go back soon! The only downside is that it is hard to find from the road, but the taste of food outweighs the location!"}
{"text":"i discovered 'baby cakes cafe' back when they offered a groupon.
luckily i bought the max which, i think, was 3.
should've had the hubby buy 3 more with his groupon account.
i digress...

i haven't been back since they changed the name to \"baby stacks\" and am curious as to the reasoning behind the name change.
hoping it's still under the same ownership.

either way, i've always had a great experience at baby...cakes...stacks...this establishment.
they have a wonderful selection of filipino/hawaiian breakfast and lunch selections as well as an extensive pancake selection.
they also offer daily specials as well as a daily pancake special.
my favorite is the red velvet but the lemon ricotta, the pumpkin and the banana p'cakes are also quite tasty.
the adobo fried rice omelet is so good (better than most other places in town).
the benedicts are really good.
but the best thing about this restaurant is that they'll make you just about anything you want.
whether it's subbing something on the menu or just simply ordering something off the menu, they'll accommodate you.

i haven't a clue how they cook anything therefore can't attest to the freshness of their food.
it would be nice to know if they're an organic or farmer friendly establishment.
whether or not they make their own sauces, batters and such.
the only thing i did notice is that their maple syrup comes out of one of those costco sized cans.
i think if they were a more farm to table type of place, i'd easily give them 5 stars.

the coffee is only just mediocre.
i really wish they'd up their coffee game a bit.
i think that'd make a huge difference as well.

the service has always been great here.
yes, there is usually a bit of a wait as the restaurant itself is quite small.
this is not a place for those who are in a hurry to get their food and run.
it's a relaxing spot for those who are looking to burn some time with good food in the company of good people."}
{"text":"boy if you should be stuck in Henderson this is a must stop for breakfast. Amazing pancakes"}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday around 1pm and there was no wait. Yay.  There were so many things I wanted to try, but I can only eat so much, so I got the kahlua pig benedict. My hubby got the spam scramble and we got a short stack of bacon pancakes to share.

We both liked the spam scramble the most... so simple, yet so delicious! 

The kahlua pig itself was also good, though I'd have to say, as a benedict with the hollandaise sauce, the two flavors were competing with each other.  And they didn't quite go together, in my opinion.

The bacon pancake was just okay too. I had such high hopes for it, since I love both things.  I was hoping the bacon was crumbled inside the pancake, but it was more like two strips of bacon plopped onto a cooking pancake. The pancake also seemed too fluffy to me.  Maybe as a meal on its own, it would've been delicious, but since we already ate other entrees before trying it, it became too much.

I give 4 stars overall, because the service was superb, and there are so many more things I want to try from their menu!"}
{"text":"Our trip to Vegas is never complete without breakfast from BabyStacks. We usually get the Adobo Fried Rice, but since they had the special Portuguese Sausage Fried Rice, so we gave it a try. Did not disappoint. We had to order another one to go for the road. No shame haha"}
{"text":"I'm so stuffed!!!! This place was packed, the parking lot was even packed. But so worth the wait!! Checked in host said 30 min but we were seated in maybe 20. We were greeted as soon as we sat down and drink order was taken. Our server came back with out drinks and took our order, she was super friendly and all smiles!!! 

Our food came out soon after, we were shocked how fast it came. We were starving so we were incredibly happy. My son scarfed down his food, but he said \"now that was good\". Spinach Benedict YUMMMM. Red velvet pancakes were delicious with its cream cheese syrup, mouth watering!! Definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows no matter how awsome the food is, service is what makes or breaks a business.  Ummm, everyone except Babystacks Cafe that is. Yes, the food is great. Had the honey toast (french toast), which was proportioned just right. Expect to wait, wait, wait....and wait for every aspect of dining out. Seating, beverage service, ordering to receiving your meal is Extremely frustrating! especially when the staff seems so uninterested in providing even bare minimum service. Where do they get these servers? Im sure they are friends or relatives of the owner who probably think no matter how awful a job they do, they won't lose their job. It's a real shame, since the food is great...."}
{"text":"Wow! Simply amazing, I wish I knew about this place a long time ago. I was introduced to this establishment by my boyfriend and I absolutely love it. All employees are courteous and friendly, they do have long waiting times but that is only because of how wonderful they are. Despite how busy they can get, staff remains professional and restaurant remains clean.
They do their best to sit arriving guest but this location is very small and waiting time can get a bit crazy. 
This restaurant needs to expand their business hours and open more locations. 
I will highly recommend everyone to give it a try as Babystacks is very inexpensive and amazing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to have breakfast, eat here.  Fast and friendly service and amazing pancakes.   We had the lemon riccota and cinabun pancakes.   Perfection!"}
{"text":"Dined here many times without any issues but today we tried to dine at babystacks & my boyfriend & I ordered at (1:00 pm)as time goes by (1:30pm) I see tables that sat down after us getting their food. My boyfriend said to the server \"a lot of tables got their food after us, at least 5 tables\" & the servers response was \"I know.\"  Like he didn't care or our time isn't valuable too. Terrible, we left right after that."}
{"text":"Babystacks Cafe makes good tasting breakfasty brunchy type food. If you're in the mood for something breakfasty or brunchy then you should give them a try.

More specifically they make good tasting variations on traditional egg and pancake dishes mixed with some Hawaiian style recipes. Delish!

The service is always pleasantly friendly and the cafe itself is a comfortable place to have a meal. It does get busy, so there is a possibility you'll have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"So it's a busy labor day brunch. Seriously packed OR there were just a ton of college (highschool acting) kids waiting to be seated. My wait was only about 10 -15 minutes-ish, which is fine for me.

Was sat down and ordered the scrambled eggs with diced spam and furikake on rice. I know, so Hawaiian of me. My friend ordered biscuit something and something egg. I didn't care, I was just eggs-cited for my egg. Haha, pun intended. 

Got my food and took a bite of of the scrambled egg and spam. Eh, it's alright. The egg was still runny as if it wasn't cooked enough OR not scrambled enough. The spam was still pink as if it just came out of the can. Oh yeah, especially the rice. I'm Asian and I know what rice is supposed to taste like. It was really undercook, kinda hard and very dry. It wasn't great, it was just undercooked. 

Been here once before and the food was amazing. Now, I really wouldn't come back on a busy day knowing that BabyStacks Cafe wouldn't be able to maintain the quality of their food regardless of the traffic."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a LV native after a long morning of traveling. Great service and even more delicious food! Absolutely would come back if I am ever in town again!"}
{"text":"I came early in the morning I think It was 5 minutes before they even open so I was the first one at the door, so no problem with lines which from what I have read in yelp is the biggest problem they have here.

I ordered Red velvet pancake which was just heavenly. and adobo fried rice which was also good but not as good as the red velvet pancake. 

Note: for first time costumer definitely try the red velvet pancake before you order anything."}
{"text":"This location is a lot bigger than the one on Buffalo which is nice. The food is delicious as always and the service is also great and I always get my adobo fried rice. My only complaint is the old white lady up in the front wasn't very welcoming or nice either. No need to be an old grumpy fart to your customers for no reason!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Breakfast with many options, always friendly staff, and mind-blowing pancakes!!! Hazelnut and Red-velvet are must try!"}
{"text":"You can never have enough of a good thing in life! I have always been Huge fan of the Babystacks Cafe most notable for the Red Velvet Pancakes. Really comes too breakfast foods or a recovery meal after long day of training for triathlon. No other spot look forward to refuel. Besides the fact can get some local moco, portuguese sausage, spam, and all kine local grinds takes me back to 808. I never been too this location before use too another location closer too home on the other side of town. I was excited too hear about this new location because its closer too the Lake and the perfect spot on the way back from training can get my recovery meal in. Just so happen my review for Babystacks Cafe was for day of training but not at the Lake.

Naturally you would expect lot of similarities between all three locations. I have only been too two of the three. Coming to this location felt like everything was just as five star experience at the other location. I love the decor from the speciality board when you first walk in. One that most people forget too check out. Some days that pancakes specials make my favorite Red Velvet not sound so Ono. Make point too check it out! They have little coffee bar area so if eating by yourself perfect spot chill get your breakfast on. The tables are little tight packed so depending on the crowd feels like in on the next table conversation. Really not that bad. The service I read some review that felt like the service was slow, poor, and not very good. I got here little early but they still went ahead and sat me. Once I was seated got asked what like to drink very quickly and waitress greeted me. She was very nice since I was waiting on friend. She like take your time and no problem. The service was awesome! 

I mixed it up this visit. I ordered the Huntington Omelette. I substituted egg whites always feels make any omelette better. Not normally Omelette guy but love the fact that nice size one. It packed with filling everything and the melted cheese on top with sliced of fresh avocado. You put some of that pico de gallo sauce on top brings it all together. The seasoned fries for my side delicious. It really is the prefect hearty breakfast of champions!!! One that not matter the menu selection spot on delicious!! Happy that now have one on each side of town get my Babystacks Cafe on........"}
{"text":"Pancakes were definitely a hit for my family! Overall breakfast was awesome. The only thing that needed improvement was the timing of food preparation and delivering to table. My kids had to wait 10 minutes longer than us to receive their meals because of their pancakes."}
{"text":"Awful. After waiting for 30 minutes of \"an hour\" wait the girl said it would still be another hour. The food is not that good. Plus it could use a good cleaning over the whole place. Next time you want to have breakfast, keep driving; you can find another place."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The food is just ok. We had 8 people and 6 of the 8 had pancakes of some variety. The 4 people that ordered other items with or without pancake got their food. The pancakes came out 15 minutes after the other food. Get it together and serve everything at once. The Oj tastes like it comes out of a box (like cocktail mix) or shelf stable juice. GROSS."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful service!  The restaurant had a unique family/Hawaiian feel to it.  I saw a Groupon for this restaurant, but didn't get to it fast enough and it sold out.  However, I still wanted to try it out and I was not disappointed!  I ordered the Portuguese Sausage, Scrambled eggs, Hash browns and Red Velvet pancakes.  My boyfriend ordered almost the same exact thing, except he got rice and toast with his instead.  The sausage was amazing paired with the eggs and hash browns.  The pancakes were good as well and did taste very much like cake.  Next time, I plan on trying the Cinnabun pancakes, because the description on the menu sounded really tasty!  :)"}
{"text":"it's been a minute since i've been to babystacks.
i think the last time was when it was still babycakes and they only had the one location.
now they have 3 locations which is a good sign.
i'm happy for their success and i'm also happy to report that they are just as good, if not better, than they ever were.

i had the breakfast burrito with no meat and it came with a side order of 2 buttermilk pancakes.
the burrito was good but nothing extraordinary.
the pancakes were a lot better than i remember.
they were fluffy, buttery and perfectly cooked.
the hubby had the loco moco which looked delicious.
his over medium egg was cooked to perfection, slightly runny in the middle and the garlic fried rice was tasty and very garlicky.
their mac salad is quite tasty as well.

i remember in the past thinking that their food was pedestrian with nothing too spectacular but i believe they've made some improvements and it definitely shows.
they appear to have put much more thought into their menu.
their pancake selection is large and i look forward to returning to try something new.

i'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, this my favorite breakfast place every time I come to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Just returned for my second visit this past weekend. This place has yet to disappoint! Both times there has been a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. Staff is always super friendly. Food is unique, delish and filling. My only complaint is the regular syrup seems to harden and become chunky, but still does the job."}
{"text":"This place has the best pancakes you can dream of. So many flavors and all to die for! My personal favorite which is not written on the menu is the German chocolate pancakes. Absolutely amazing! If you like garlic, upgrade your side to the garlic rice, you won't be disappointed.

The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always eager to help you. We come here all the time and can't get enough of it.

And last but not least you won't break your budget with this place. You will get out of there with a full belly and still a full wallet!"}
{"text":"Not to bad for breakfast. They have a lot to offer which can be a little overwhelming when it's time to order. Ordered the adobo fried rice and biscuits and gravy. Let me say they serve a lot of food... definitely full after. Will go again and explore the pancake options next time."}
{"text":"I'm not one to send back my food out of fear of what would be done, but I had asked for crispy bacon and received it flimsy I couldn't eat it because I don't even think it wasn't cooked all the way. So I asked the waitress if I could get it crispy. 
Oh, I got it crispy... It was more like cremated, and extra hot. The waitress didn't even bring it back to me. It was someone from the back as if it was a slap in the face. He didn't say anything just placed it on the table. 
This place is always so busy and the food isn't any better than IHOP, just pricier. 
I will never return. Because of poor customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! This place has great customer service and is a great place to eat! Definitely try the Eggs Benedict or Loco Moco!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is good, I usually have great service, but a few times when they're slammed it's a little off. You can try just about anything on the menu and its be awesome. During the weekend mornings, they're pretty busy, so expect to wait a little if you try and go."}
{"text":"We ordered a few things, a savory crepe from the specials, red velvet pancakes and kalua pig benedict from the regular menu/ The special wasn't too special, but the pancakes and benedicts were the BEST! The red velvet pancakes were very rich and the cream cheese syrup went perfect together! Though it was quite crowded on the weekend, it was worth it! MMM I may just head there right now..."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on a Saturday.  My first advice would be to come early!  We had to wait in line for a little over an hour.  Once we were sited they took our order again they were busy so it took a while for the food to come, but I have to say the food was well worth it :)  My husband and I both got the bacon egg and pancake combo and upgraded our pancakes to the orange creamsicle and the white chocolate macedonian pancakes.  Super delicious make sure you order milk though because they are super sweet."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good breakfast off the strip, Babystacks is a solid choice. Located in the Flamingo Village Plaza/strip mall, it's not hard to find. Plenty of parking is available, and the café seems to be pretty busy on the weekends. 

When we arrived around 11 on Sunday, we were told it would be up to 45 minutes before we could be seated. Lucky for us, the wait turned out to be only half an hour. 

The specialty here is clearly pancakes, red velvet, orange Creamsicle, pumpkin, strawberry and all the usual suspects are on the menu. I had the pumpkin pancakes which were served with whipped cream and cream cheese \"dressing.\"  Although yummy, my pancakes were a bit dry, the waitress offered to bring something else, but I was almost done with my meal at that point. Overall, the service is friendly and the food was good I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going here for breakfast! It's not usually packed when we arrive but by the time we leave it's a very long wait. Food is always good, there's a lot to choose from too..so be prepared to drool over everything on the menu. Great service all the time!"}
{"text":"If you want pancakes, look no further. This place delivers a good variety of pancakes, check out their menu. 

I came with a group of pancake snobs and we all agreed, these were some good pancakes. The toppings and sauces are really good and creative, it is truly a nice meal. I had some eggs with potatoes and these were nicely seasoned too. Coffee was also good, and service was fast and friendly. Rounding up to 5 stars, no problem."}
{"text":"The food was ok, however the service was terrible. Our waitress was sweet and attentive however the hostess when we went to pay and the manager were very rude. They do not split or give you a separate check so we calculated how much we owed and they ended up over charging us. I am willing to try another location but we will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"It's a fairly typical breakfast joint.  Nothin special about their food or service. Actually the service was sort of \"indifferent\" and the guy taking payment was not friendly. 

My custom ordered breakfasts burrito literally had 2 or 3 pieces of the extra ingredients I asked for. 

I might go again if I'm in the mood for run-of-the-mill breakfast food I could have cooked at home but was too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Go with a group and sample as many pancake flavors as you can! They were all surprising and delicious.


If you're going to spend $ on breakfast, this is the place to do it. I honestly HATE spending money on breakfast. What is a pancake, except for some flour and water? And Let's be real, waffles are WAAAAAY better. 

Except here! We found BabyStacks when looking online at places to eat off the strip. We live in Ut and make the trek to Las Vegas a few times a year. Buffets and overpriced hotel food gets old. When we heard about the red velvet pancakes, we figured it was worth the drive. 

BabyStacks, is really small, and if you get there are the wrong, time or with a larger group expect to wait. We were a party of 4 and waited about 25 minutes on a week day. It is a family run establishment and everyone is really friendly and nice. They are quick to refill your drinks and check in a few times to see if you need anything else, and to make sure everything is tasting great. The staff was really accommodating- my mom wanted Adobo but no rice, and not in a full plate. They threw in a side for her, free of charge so she could taste it. Maybe it was because we ordered so many damn pancakes. 

We decided to just go hog wild. We ordered 6 small stacks so we could all try different pancakes: red velvet, carrot cake, rocky road, orange creamsicle, white chocolate macadamia Nut & banana cream pie. They were surprisingly delicious. We figured we would find one or two that was a miss, but we didn't. The carrot cake was my favorite, and the orange creamsicle tasted just like the popsicle of my childhood. I only wish they had a sampler platter so that you could taste a variety of pancakes. 

We will defiantly be going back on our next trip to finish tasting the rest of the pancake menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my daughter's favorite places for breakfast. It usually has a long wait but the sweet cream pancakes are worth it. I had a cowboy omelette today and it was very good. The veggies were tasty in the omelette and I polished it off with the pancakes. The coffee is good and strong too. I like the servers there. They are always polite and courteous and once seated, usually l  get fed pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly staff. You must try one of their specialty pancakes. We take all of our out of town guests here."}
{"text":"Good for one or two people .  They don't split checks other then in half.   Won't see you if your whole party is not there.   Even if you said they are around the corner they want seat you .   They also served cold coffee as well ?  No freshness ?  I know it's just coffee but what's your Standard ? Wasn't aloud to sit outside it was closed because it was dirty they said.  Standards again ?  Place was not for me and my family and friends so didn't want to here any more rules from this place so we left"}
{"text":"A lush place to have breakfast, lunch, or brunch. lets see. been coming here for sunday brunch on a regular. so far, i've had the red velvet pancakes, loco moco, and s'mores pancakes. pancakes come with a side of cream cheese syrup- extras available upon request, gorgeous. this place pushes the envelope for you traditional pancakes. instead of pancakes with a side of bacon, they actually have pancakes with bacon bits hidden inside. delicious as its name, but a little too sweet for my brunch taste. so on my last visit, i had the lolo moco: rice, meatloaf patty, side of eggs made to my choice, and all of that drenched in gravy. comes with a side of mac salad. the food portion actually meets my appetite needs, for what i pay for. however, the mac salad isn't that special. the sweet customer service reflects its cafe name, so need i say more. its a comfy zone and has two big screens to watch sunday football. servers are more than happy to switch the channels between other tv networks. i've had great experiences so far, so i definitely have no reason to give any less stars."}
{"text":"MORE spacious than original baby stacks. i wanna say, probably 3 times the size of the original location. clientele is familyesque. I adore the wrap-around the wall benches for seating. the giant butterflies...? mmm not so much. but there's a high-counter seating if you decide to come solo... or not.

the red velvet pancakes never fail. but the real secret weapon would be the carrot cake pancakes for its hint of spice and nuts as toppings. its sweet, but not too sweet. order it with a glass of milk if you will, to balance that brilliantly tasty cream cheese frosting.

i also recommend the loco moco. the service is friendly in accomodating about 10 of us.

i'll be back, also hoping to see some new stuff on their menu soon."}
{"text":"I finally got around too trying more of the menu at BabyStacks Cafe and again not disappointed! I tried me some Adobo Fried Rice and course had too get me some Red Velvet Pancakes. If not going too BabyStacks getting some Red Velvet Pancakes that borderline atrocity too pancake nation! lol! The Adobo Fried Rice was awesome! Who would have thought just roll out almost crepe like consistency egg batter load it up with delicious fried rice, fold it like burrito, and dam you got breakfast burrito from heaven. The fried rice has SO much flavor no need too add anything else and it huge size not getting cheated out of anything. The fried rice by itself could have big bowl everyday its that ONO! The pancakes no need too review that one. If never had it need too get some...

The service is always great my server was punctual came too asking for my drink order, and return soon after taking my breakfast order. It does get busy but tend too go places odd time beat the rush. My drink was never empty. It not often go out for breakfast but by far my favorite place for some good breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast meal with the family, had to wait a little bit, but it's definitely worth it, the chili and potatoes were so good Holy Spirit. Red velvet pancakes were also delicious. The red velvet tastes better at this location then the flamingo one I'm not sure why just different cooks I guess. The loco moco with garlic rice was also good just real garlicy if you're into it then you will like it. Staff is friendly and the environment is really chill. Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service, food, and atmosphere make this my new goto breakfast joint. AMAZING FILIPINO AMERICAN FOOD. You choose to make it fusion or not. only thing I could and did ask for was Lumpia!! Everything else is amazing and delicious."}
{"text":"The service here was friendly and the food came out quickly.  I don't know the name of our server, but she provided great customer service while managing her section.  I had the Kahlua Pork eggs benedict with seasoned potatoes and we ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes for the table.  Everything was delicious!  My friend and my sis enjoyed our experience here that we would definitely consider returning."}
{"text":"THE spot to hit up for delicious pancakes. Not regular buttermilk pancakes biut a variety of delicious flavors ranging from orange dreamsicle, lemon riccota, cinnabun, chocolate chip, banana and of course RED VELVET!!  Cream cheese frosting 

This place is always busy and once you have visited you know why. Their specialties are the pancakes so save your appetite and pick between a short stack (3), full stack (6) or a full breakfast with eggs and your choice of meat with a side (2) pancakes. 

The service is par but the food more than maksa up for it."}
{"text":"Have you heard what everyone has been saying about the red velvet pancakes?  Well, it's true and more. These things are absolutely addictive.  Given the description, I really thought these pancakes had to be super sweet.  But they're not.  Even my sister, who isn't fond of sweets, loved these pancakes.  

The staff was nice enough to create a potato dish for my sister with potatoes, cheese, avocado, salsa, and sour cream.  It was really good and nice of them to be so flexible.

I got the Adobo fried rice.  It was ok.  I have to admit, I am not a big fan of Filipino food.   Same thing with Hawaiian food. A little too bland for me.  But I love Chinese fried rice, so go figure. 

All they had was Tabasco sauce, which I didn't think would work.  So I focused on the pancakes and took most of the Adobo fried rice home.  Heated up the next day and covered in sriracha, it's not too bad.

Most of the tables are high tops which can be a little uncomfortable.  And this place is tiny!  I hope they get a chance to expand.

I looking forward to coming back and trying more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"This location is larger than their location to the north.  But the wait time can still be horrendous late mornings on the weekend. Still the food was still as good as the original location.  The red velvet pancakes still rocked and the breakfast burrito (an occasional special) was excellent.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Tried the loco loco and kalula pig Benedict . Both were average at best. Gravy came from a mix and burger cooked pass death.  Kahula bene was bland with little flavor. We shared a speciality pancake and was not wowed.   Twice  have tried and both times failed.. too bad but Cinamons is 100 times better"}
{"text":"I have been to Babystacks and tried their short stack banana cream pie and the red velvet pancakes.  They were both worth the visit.  The serving size was very filling.

I only did the take out, so I can only speak to the service at the register.  I called my orders in and they were on time with the prep time.  The people at the register were pleasant.

I would recommend eating at this location."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast. 

The cream cheese coulee worked wonderfully with the red velvet pancakes. The coffee was warm and good, and the hash-browns were homemade, hot and just messy enough (although a bit too oily). 

Easily the best breakfast I've had in Vegas in all my visits. Worth a drive to Summerlin."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a while, but our most recent visit was pretty good. The only thing I hated was the wait to get seated, and the wait to get our food. 

Soon as we got seated, our server approached us with our drink orders.  Then a few minutes later, our food orders.

All in all, I would say the service was okay. Not too bad, but not the greatest either. He got all of our orders correct, and even left a few napkins here and there. Considering the fact that they were busy, I could understand why he looked a bit flustered. The food was really good, like always..which is why we come here. I would say I would come back, I love their banana pancakes and Orange creamsicle pancakes! Those two are definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Food is always good we've been here many times, never had a problem, it's just the wait to eat, there's always a long wait so be prepared to wait about 30 minutes to eat. We've eaten at all of their locations and by far this is the best one, here on North Buffalo which I believe is the original babystacks."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas and staying nearby and we stumbled upon this gem for breakfast.  What a treat!  The waiter was awesome, very attentive to us.  Our party of four all opted for a different kind of pancake and everyone raved about their meal.  I also ordered the spam and eggs as it reminded me of my childhood days.  They did not disappoint me!  I wish we would have had another opportunity to go back for another meal.  
If you're in the area and looking for a great breakfast place, give them a shot.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant since they opened but we will not anymore after the way we were treated today. We had an issue with the hostess since she ignored us and didn't even greet us. We waited for awhile until I stopped a server and she was professional and greeted us. Then when I went to pay for our bill, hostess left after she saw me walking towards her. Instead she took someone who just walked in the door while I was standing before her. Edgar alleged that he is the manager and was really rude towards us. He kept saying he will address it and basically just rush us out the door while Elsie (unsure of spelling) the hostess was smirking and smiling. I even told Edgar. Wow. Really? I hope he is not the manager because he clearly didn't care. I rather go somewhere else with better service."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff. My coffee and water were always full and my omelette and short stack were yummy."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes. Once you've had it here, nowhere else can compare.

Not a fan of the wait though, this location seems to have a longer wait than the SW location. Last time I ordered the adobo fried rice... the pork seemed a bit burnt and ruined the flavor of the whole thing. Very disappointing because I know they can do better. I think I prefer the S. Buffalo location more.

But definitely go for the pancakes. You MUST try it :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I need to get my red velvet pancake fix at least once a month. And no better place than this. This location has not done me wrong. The wait isn't as bad as the other location, and all the food has been delicious. From the different pancakes to the skillets and adobo fried rice, everything is yummy."}
{"text":"Place: pretty busy but got a seat at the bar table right away for party of 2
Service: attentive...a couple of servers checked how we were doing
Food: spam n eggs with rice..nothing special but good nonetheless...i like spam but it can be really salty esp fried...I've done this at home...I've substituted with the lemon ricotta pancake...very light and thin...I've was crepe like pancake...I've chose this because I wanted both pancake n crepe and this is in between...hubby got the rocky road pancake...this was pretty special...chocolatey but not overly sweet...it was a dessert breakfast pancake."}
{"text":"The best breakfast ever! Had Lolo Ricks adobo fried rice with the cinnabun pancakes. The perfect blend of savory, omelette, rice, meat and sweet. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always looking for great breakfast place and this is one we found.  Love the baby stack options, carrot cake yum!! The hubby love the e bgs benedict."}
{"text":"As everyone else, I'd heard and read so many things about this place, (especially the red velvet pancakes) I had to try it.
First try was on a holiday and there was an hour wait, so my daughter and I decided to come back another time. 
Second try was the very next day, a Tuesday at around 9am, and there was no waiting. We were excited to try the red velvet pancakes! We ordered a full stack to share and bring extras home. We had other things too, but the pancakes was what we craved!
SOOOOO YUUUUUM! My daughter couldn't stop eating them! I couldn't either, I must confess!
We'll be back....maybe even try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Oh what a breakfast! If you haven't eaten here, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. There is always a wait as the restaurant is pretty small, but if you're a party of two, it seems easier to be seated quickly. Be prepared, though, you may be sitting REALLY close to people at the next table. I hate this, but for such an awesome breakfast, I'll sacrifice.

I am not a pancake eater- I'm an egg & meat lover, but I just *had* to try the red velvet stacks. BabyStacks allows you to add their specialty stacks to your egg order, so I ordered a skillet (always my breakfast favorite) and added the red velvet pancakes. 

The red velvet pancakes are not too thick, not too thin, sprinkled with mini chocolate chips and a generous dollop of whipped cream. The cream cheese syrup is to die for - it just totally reminds me Nothing Bundt Cake frosting! It's like eating chocolate cake for breakfast, which may gross some people out, but for a chocolate lover it's sinfully delightful.

The skillet was one of the better skillets I've had in Vegas. They layer potatoes, cheese, and any omelet choices and top them off with eggs any style. I ordered my skillet with onion, tomaotes, spinach, cheddar cheese and sausage. It was gigantic, could barely finish half, but so full of flavor. The tomatoes were very sweet - just the way I like them.

Next trip: carrot cakes with cream cheese syrup!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The wait wasn't too long even though there were a lot of people waiting. 

Our waiter. He was super nice. He asked us what hotel we were staying at and told us where the nearest salon, Macy, and in&out burger joint was at.
We really appreciate his help!

I tried the red velvet and lemon ricotta. It was ok. I thought it would be like extremely-popping-different-good but I had better red velvet from Aulani. But at least i tried it out. I always wondered!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times. The food (especially the specialty pancakes) and service are both excellent. We have never tried anything from the lunch menu though. The prices are very reasonable. The only downside is the actual restaurant is quite small. Because it's so popular there is usually a wait to be seated (can be up to an hour). We usually avoid the wait by going there late in the morning or in the early afternoon for breakfast. Usually we only have to wait 15 minutes during that time of day. I would highly recommend visiting this place at least once."}
{"text":"The Nutella crepe is my daughters favorite so we came back a second time. I had buttermilk pancakes...flat and dense. Not even as good as a mix. . Hubby's piglet skillet was good but he had icky pancakes as well. The server was efficient and nice but  had so much perfume on I sneezed and had itchy eyes all meal. My daughter said she could actually taste it it was so strong. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good service, decent prices, and amazing quality. Food was very impressive, this was my first visit and I can't wait to go back. I would've given my experience five stars had it not been for the cashier.  Cashier was a bit on the unpleasant side, had no personality, came off as rude and appeared to not like her job. I think some coaching or customer service training is greatly needed in that area."}
{"text":"In LOVEEEEEE How many heart emojis can I use to fill up this review???? 

The pancakes are all dessert for breakfast and I'm dyingggg.. so good! 

The Hawaiian inspired food is so unique and ono..loves the kalua pork eggs Benedict and the adobo omelette. Still
Drooling"}
{"text":"I loved their \"different\" breakfast menu! The omelette was small but delicious. I felt the restaurant was to small inside but that's just my opinion. I heard the red velvet pancakes were great!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!! I love that their foods are based on Hawaiian dishes. First thing I want to say is.. RED VELVET PANCAKES!!!!! It's so awesome!! Also try their spam fried rice. It's so good. Everything on their menu is good."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from the local las vegas newspaper, so my husband and i thought we should give it a try. For one we had never heard of a place having red velvet pancakes.. second it is a locals place. a little hole in the wall and thats exactly what we were lookin' for.

Was easy to find. Heard about waits, but we got there around 11am-ish and got seated right away. I can understand some peoples complaints about waiting because there isnt much seating. But then again, when its a small owned business that serves good food, a wait is expected.

The service was good. Lady was friendly and helpful with menu. I ordered something boring [eggs, bacon, regular pancakes]. Didnt want to go over board since i was pregnant and still had morning sickness. My food was good. The hubby ordered the loco moco and bacon pancakes. He raved that the pancakes were delish, but said the loco moco should have had more rice. 

Overall was good and we shall come here again :)"}
{"text":"Really really yummy food!  This tiny little restaurant is great.  I've eaten here for breakfast.  We were able to walk in and get a table right away but there was quite a crowd when we left, so I imagine that could be hit or miss.

The food was great!  Red Velvet Pancakes?  Are you kidding me?  So stinkin' good.  We also tried the omlettes which are equally delicous.  I can't wait to go back and try the S'mores pancakes.  And the Peanut Butter and Banana."}
{"text":"I always see this place crazy busy and wanted to know what the hype was so I went and gave it a shot. We had to wait 20 minutes and there were quite a few empty tables and a couple bar seats available. I asked if we could sit at the bar and we were immediately seated before other customers that were already waiting. 

I ordered an omelette and my wife some eggs Benedict. The plates came and didn't look like anything special. For some reason my plate had a lone mushroom on it, and I didn't even order mushrooms in my omelette. My wife's plate could have used more sauce and the muffin was a little burnt. 

Overall, the place is not bad but is not anything special. I don't see myself going back unless I get a BOGO, but I don't see them putting any deals out."}
{"text":"Babystacks never disappoints. All their food is delicious and fresh, and every flavor of pancakes we have ever ordered has been fantastic. It's our go to breakfast spot, especially when we have company in town! There is usually a wait on the weekends, but it never takes very long! Food always comes out quickly too, and our servers are always friendly!"}
{"text":"BabyStacks Cafe is definitely going to be added to our list of favorite Las Vegas haunts!

Thanks to all the positive Yelp reviews, we decided to go on an adventure  and check out this place.  We were not disappointed!

Warning....the restaurant is small so expect to wait.  We noticed that there were several empty tables while we were waiting.  Maybe this is to allow the wait staff to provide all their customers outstanding service.

Hubby ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  The omelette is stuffed with shredded chicken meat and rice.  Served with your choice of Mac salad or potatoes.  Huge!  

I had Portuguese Sausage, Rice and Eggs which is served with your choice of BabyStacks pancakes or toast.  I upgraded to garlic rice and Red Velvet pancakes. Mmm...mm good.  Don't scrimp, it's worth the extra charge.

Red Velvet Pancakes are a definite must!

Portions are generous.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were great.  I went at 1030 and it was a 30 min wait for the table. They only give you a lil cup of syrup and if you run out its .75 for more."}
{"text":"I am the type of person that avoids busy restaurants, so let me start of by saying the sheer popularity of BabyStacks is the only reason I don't go more. Their locations are far too small to keep up with the demand. On the days I am craving spam and eggs, my personal favorite, I make sure to wake up before the crack of dawn and get there when they open to avoid any rush. The fact that I do this at all should state how good their food is. 

It's my every once and while breakfast treat. If you don't like crowds and you refuse to wake up early, probably hit up the next breakfast joint on your list."}
{"text":"We had a very negative experience here. One member of our party ordered a fruit bowl and the fruit cake out rotten. They also allowed a dog to sit in the restaurant. One member of our party is severely allergic to dogs. I was very disappointed that they would allow pets."}
{"text":"I came here two times. The first time my girlfriend and I were like omg this place is amazing we were so happy with how much food we got too. She ordered the banana foster pancakes with eggs and potatoes. And for myself I got a BYO Omlette with potatoes and upgraded to the banana foster pancakes as well, also with a side of red velvet pancakes. These pancakes were so big and huge we were shocked how good they were. On top of that our server which I forgot his name was outstanding, He was by far a very good server and on top of his work. First visit I was like 5/5.

So how amazing it was the first time we decided to come again I even skipped my gym session just to make it since they do close early, and that's like a very big thing for me to do. So when we get there we get sat right away it was way less busier than the first time. Our server was kool she didn't go the extra miles but was there and took our order. My girl got the same thing as last time and me myself got BYO Omlette potatoes and white chocolate nut pancakes. When the food arrived the potatoes and omlette seemed the same. But the pancakes were like so tiny and boring. Both her banana foster and mine seemed like all they did was throw topping on the pancakes like nothing.so they were okay. As we get our check wr go and pay while paying and I was talking to the cashier some pig of a cook was hitting on my girlfriend in Spanish. Once we got out of the building she said did you see that and I was like what and she told me she felt violated that he was saying all these nasty things and she felt violated. He was lucky I wasn't paying attention to notice cause then there would have been a problem. On top of that she is not one of those girls that dresses all out either she was just in pants and a plain tback shirt with no makeup of anything. So it wasn't like she was calling for attention like some girls do. That visit was a 1/5

We want to go back so bad but at the same time we are iffy about it. the second time we visited was just bad. We are also talking about making a trip across town to another location. Just because how great the first time it was

Also one more thing I love fresh OJ wish they had it of something better than consentrate."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the pancakes with sautéed bananas, was so delicious! I would say it was more like a dessert, but having it with the fried rice adobo omelet on the side was really a great sweet and savory combination. Husband had the red velvet pancakes, and yes, the hype is true. If we were in Vegas more than 3 days we would have went back. My brother who is a local said he hasn't had a bad meal yet!"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS try to come here when I'm in Vegas . They have pretty good potatoes . Also I always get adobo fried rice AND red velvet pancakes. I do a short stack though. It just sucks how the waiting system is. Is so small that it's hard to get through people when your name is called for your party and when you pay. But other than that service and food is bomb"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Pancakes are amazing and so many varieties. Be prepared to wait, always extremely busy. The Smores pancakes are my favorite."}
{"text":"The food is good, service is friendly, prices are excellent and portions are decent. They messed up on one of our orders but got us potatoes while we waited and didn't charge us for it. It was great and we will def be back but it doesn't beat the cracked egg."}
{"text":"Normally I am on Team Waffle, but on this visit (my first one) I decided to try some pancakes. I got the strawberries and cream pancakes with the cream cheese syrup instead of the strawberry syrup it usually comes with. The pancakes were slightly chewy and on the thinner side, which is actually how I prefer them. 

My boyfriend got the corned beef hash and eggs, which did not come out at all the way he was expecting. Normally corned beef looks like shredded beef, but this looked more like ground beef. He also said that his rice was hard. For the price, we were expecting the portions to be a little more generous; it didn't seem like that was the case for all dishes, though. 

Not anything amazing, but good for breakfast/ brunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of pancakes. Being a southern girl I grew up with Waffle House but I love this place!! I tried both the strawberry lemonade & s'mores pancakes (on two separate occasions) and loved them both!! I just wish they opens before 7am as I work late nights & would love to go straight there when I get off. Other than that this place is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great food, I have had breakfast and lunch. Awesome service.  They need to refine takeout orders and how they are put together. However it is 5 star all the way."}
{"text":"Listen to your YELP friends, people. This place is good for one thing and one thing only: PANCAKES. 

My girlfriend and I got here after waking up late on Sunday morning with an epic sweet tooth. She was craving chocolate cake so I figured this would be a great spot. 

It was semi crowded by the time we got there. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, but we were given the option of sitting at the dining counter within 5 minutes. We aren't picky, so we took it! (One star here for under-promising and over-achieving. BabyStacks does a good job of over estimating wait times and then having you seated before your estimated wait time expires. This is great, in my opinion. Nothing bugs me more than being told 15 minutes and waiting 40.) 

Ashley ordered the red velvet pancakes. She knew what she was getting before we even got there. I ordered the eggs and bacon with white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes ($1 upcharge for their specialty pancakes - well worth it). 

Let me say this: the rest of their breakfast foods aren't all that great. The bacon actually didn't taste very good and the eggs were nothing special. The only reason I ordered them was because I figured I should get some protein in me. However, in all honesty, if you're coming here, you should be coming for pancakes and not expect much else. The home fries or breakfast potatoes were also pretty bland, as if they came from a frozen bag. 

However, I'm still going to give 5 stars because I have never tasted better pancakes in my life. Ashley's red velvet pancakes came with cream cheese type syrup. They were UNBELIEVABLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS. My white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were also good - not as good as hers - but still very soft, delicious, and with white chocolate morsels that were half melted into the pancakes. MMMM. 

So, seriously guys, when a restaurant names themselves after PANCAKES and specialize in PANCAKES, don't order something other than PANCAKES. 

:)"}
{"text":"We had to wait about 20 mins, but it was a Saturday morning so I'd expect that. There was hardly any seating for waiting, so that is tough with kids or elderly people in your group. There is NO seating outside either for while you wait. The service is average, I had to ask for more coffee and they brought a wrong order at first. So one of us had to wait while the others sat there with their food. That always stinks. The food was good, though very rich. That wasn't surprising, because just reading the menu tells you it's all very decadent. I tried everyone's dishes and they were all good, Red Velvet pancakes, Orange Dream pancakes, Lemon Ricotta pancakes and Chicken Fried Steak. We will be back."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes with Cream Cheese syrup! Yes! It's amazing! I am not a big fan of cupcakes but I had to try these out and I am hooked! The pancakes are nice and fluffy topped with chocolate shavings, whipped cream and Cream cheese syrup! This is a must try! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the Red Velvet Pancakes here. They make it like no other place. It is light and fluffy sprinkled with chocolate shavings and cocoa powder and topped with light whipped cream. There is also a side of cream cheese syrup but I don't use it because the pancake itself is already perfect! This is one of my go to breakfast spots when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is awesome.  I'm not a huge fan of Red Velvet, but the Revel er pancakes are soooooo delicious.  Hubby had the Mexican omlette that was very good also.  Can't wait to go back and try the strawberry pancakes. Oh, and the wait is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Went here looking for a real good breakfast spot after reading the reviews.  I must say that overall, I was pretty disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, I really did, as I want a great breakfast spot.  This is a pretty small (about 10 tables) spot in a little shopping center.

First off, the orange juice I ordered was tasted like cheap concentrate, which is a knock against them in my book.  Second, the service was pretty slow.  We were a party of 6, and they brought 2 plates of food, then a few minutes later, 2 more.  By the time they brought the last 2 orders, I had already almost finished my breakfast.  Not to mention, one of the last orders was bacon and eggs, and the bacon was ice cold when it came out.  Third, the potatoes that came with some of the entrees were just frozen bag potatoes (the little squares), which were mediocre at best.  I had a full order of blueberry pancakes, which were fine, but nothing to write home about.  They say they are homemade, but does that just mean you made some instant batter?  The pancakes were not terrible, although I thought they were a little rubbery, and the portion size did not blow me away.  My wife, however, did enjoy her cowboy omelette quite a bit.  She stated the mix and texture of ingredients was very good, although I do not enjoy omelettes so I cannot comment directly.  Also, some in my party had huevos rancheros, which had a pair of absolutely dry and miserable looking cheap store bought tortillas in them.

The menu is filled with a lot of esoteric items, like red velvet pancakes, loco moko, kalua pig, etc.  I think that a great deal of the interest in this place is the variety of unique breakfast offerings on the menu.  However, I found that for standard breakfast fare, the quality and service were pretty mediocre at best.  Now to be fair, the service was polite and friendly, just not that efficient.  Overall, I found what most of us ordered to be perfectly average or below average, so I am not sure where the fuss is.  Maybe if I had ordered something unique like the red velvet pancakes, but as I said before, I would expect better work on the basics."}
{"text":"It's customary to wait 45 minutes for a table here on the weekends. The unusual part is that I wait joyously and eager for a table the entire wait. I believe that everyone around me feels the same way as we wait for the BEST PANCAKES in town! So delicious,  I savor every bite! Rocky road, red velvet, and carrot cake... just to name a few.
Rumor has it they're opening a second location.... I can only dream."}
{"text":"In town for kids' basketball this past August. We found this on yelp, wanted to give it a try. I can't stop thinking about the carrot cake pancakes. And their garlic fried rice. The staff was friendly, willing to offer recommendations, and the food was delicious. There's easy parking, and the place is kid friendly. Good enough for me! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes $5.75

Banana Pancakes $4.75

Rick's Adobo Fried Rice $9.25

Cora's Corned Beef Hash and Eggs $10.95

If anyone from Waipahu knows Rocky's cafe, Babystacks is like the new and nicer version. I've been here twice: Once to order a take out and the other time I ate here with my wife. The red velvet and banana cakes were really good; very rich, sweet, and filling. The adobo fried rice was one of the best I've tasted. It wasn't too salty or greasy like some other versions i've tasted. The corned beef hash and eggs were simple and good but not worth the price. If you're looking for some good pancakes and Hawaiian kine grindz, Babystacks is the place to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Las Vegas. Great food! Wish they had more space, it is ALWAYS packed. Will be an ongoing customer."}
{"text":"Food is always fantastic and service is amazing! I have ventured out on some of the different pancakes that they do and they are just good. They try out new pancakes on their special board as well. I always make my own omlet, which is consistently perfect! I would recommend this place to anyone, but make sure to get their early as they can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"This is a good place for breakfast and has a small town vibe to it.

The service is good.

If waiting is a testament to quality on a weekend, this is a great place since there's a line and it seems like a popular place for breakfast.

I'm not a huge fan of anyone's pancakes, so did get some for free with my entree meal of Portuguese Sausage, potatoes and eggs.

This restaurant has a Pacific Islander, Hawaiian or Filipino feel to it, as far as influence.  Which makes this place unique and appealing to recommend others to try the Portuguese Sausage over your standard ham, sausage or bacon breakfast meats."}
{"text":"Maybe I've outgrown Babystacks...
9am and not busy.  Ordered two eggs over medium with sausage links, garlic rice and short stack of buttermilk cakes...eggs were cooked correctly but were cold; garlic rice was heavy with oil and too much onion; pancakes arrived to the table three minutes after the eggs and were undercooked, still wet in the middle. 
Not a good visit this time; seating is still uncomfortable as I'm a big guy and was seated at a small table ...anyone passing by me couldn't do so without bumping into me.
Managed to eat half my breakfast before I gave up..the aftertaste of the garlic rice oil still heavy on my tongue..."}
{"text":"Had brunch here. Can't say it's awesome! But now the Red Velvet Pancakes...amazing!! I'd come back for the red velvet pancakes alone. I think here it's all about what you order. Good service, decently priced."}
{"text":"This place feels like any other breakfast joint in Vegas. There was about a 20-30 min wait ahead of me. The service was okay. Overall friendly. 

I had the Portuguese sausage and eggs with the red velvet pancakes. There is plenty of hype about these red velvet pancakes. It pretty much tasted like a cupcake in pancake form. I enjoyed them. But I do have a sweet tooth for things like these. The rest of the breakfast didn't really stand out to me. It was okay. 

As much as I have a sweet tooth, this place is just okay. I would probably come back just to try other kinds of pancakes."}
{"text":"Food a 5, small restaurant and seating not very comfortable and therefore long wait reduced the overall rating for me.

I had the Rick's Abodo Rice (with egg whites) - WOW! Delicious.  All of the fun pancakes looked really good too.  Bananas Foster, Red Velvet, etc.  My hubby had the Bacon pancakes.  Will have to go back next time I'm in Vegas to try more items."}
{"text":"Heard about baby stacks from a friend so my wife and I decided to give baby stacks a try. It's a nice little restaurant the service was pretty good. I had Portuguese sausage eggs and rice. That was pretty good. My wife had the pork adobo fried rice omelet. She said the eggs was a little over cook and dry but she enjoyed it. But the red velvet pancakes was awesome. It's a little small but I ordered the short stack so maybe that's how it comes. But it was really good and the cream cheese syrup just tops it off!!
If you ever in Vegas you gotta stop here and hit up those red velvet pancakes. I would definitely come back to baby stacks when ever I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing. Tried this off the strip place for breakfast from the reviews on Yelp. Yup is was delicious with very creative seasonal pancakes  yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is an amazin breakfast spot! Love it, love it, love it! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time this past Friday. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed and got seated right away. Our server was very nice, ALWAYS smiling and helped us by recommending my boyfriend the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, it was great!! He also had the oreo pancakes and he was in heaven... LOL. I had the red velvet pancakes and they were very yummy, very soft not dry at all. The sauce is delicious too! Overall great little nice place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"I went to eat here with a group of 8. We were all excited to eat their food because of course this place is known for their red velvet pancakes. Our waitress got mine and my boyfriend's order wrong and we told her that we wanted the adobo fried rice with a side of hash browns because we couldn't do a full stack of pancakes as a side. Instead she gives us all of that and a side of two pancakes. We said we didn't order that and she had the nerve to argue with us saying we did order it and she did ask. She couldn't even be nice enough to take it away but instead made us keep it. She also impolitely told our table that they don't split checks and it was posted on the door. Sorry your handwritten small sign wasn't enough to catch our attention. I don't understand why this place doesn't split checks when I used to before. I don't plan on coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for the adobo fried rice and was very happy with it. 
Service was slow. The place was busy, but not so busy that you should need to flag down multiple servers for a water refill or the check, but that's what ended up happening anyway. Minus one star for (lack of) service.
Would come back for the adobo fried rice, but I'll get it to go next time."}
{"text":"Service: Excellent and courteous
Menu: great diversity with Asian influence
Speed: my order was out to me super quick
Price:  very good deal
Repeat: Yes and would recommend friends

I tried the spam sliders and were way better than my expectations!"}
{"text":"Disappointment.. We used to come here all the time until recently when they have became really busy so I started to do take out orders. I decided today that I was going to do that and I called. The girl out me on hold for 8 minutes (I have a lot of patience).. I decided to just drive there and make an order since I had some shopping to do and I could swing by and just pick up my order. I walk in through the door and the girl asked if she could help, I told her I was the person they put on hold for 8 mins. I told her I wanted to make a take out order. She then said \"we not doing take out right now.. Take out orders are on hold right now..\" Ok, I get you're busy and you're cooks can't keep up but you could've said it to me when I called instead of keeping me on hold and waste my time.. Smh. I won't be eating here anymore nor ordering. Looks like I will find a new place. They really need to make this place bigger and hire more people. Or go find a new spot that's bigger that can handle all their guests."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last 4 years for work meetings. I usually order French toast, pancakes an omelette or waffles and it's always been amazing! Last week I ordered steak and eggs and I won't do that again lol but the service was excellent. We will be back.

Note: they won't seat your party until everyone has arrived and they don't split checks at all."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the great reviews for this place. On Thursday I waited 45 minutes for a ToGo order.  After I got home they forgot one of the sides, even after all the time it took them to make it. I was pretty upset that they couldn't get my order correct.  The food was just mediocre and looked even less appealing.  These were supposed to be Carrot Cake pancakes and the Mexican omelette.  Here's a picture..."}
{"text":"BabyStacks is one of my fave breakfast joints. 

It's right up the street from our house so it could be super convenient. I'll touch on that later.

The main thing I love is the creative selection of their pancakes and that they have specials of them occasionally too! The Red Velvet made them famous and for good reason but I urge you to stray away and try some of the other yummy pancakes! The second thing I love is that you can get a full breakfast platter for under $10. The works, a little bit of everything. Eggs, potatoes, toast, SPAM :) and pancakes. An up charge for a special flavor but it's not much. I like when I don't have to choice my favorite breakfast components or spend a fortune on getting all the additional sides. 

They opened a location on South Buffalo because this location became so popular and it is super small. Which comes to my gripe with BabyStacks, not because there is a wait but because every time I go or call ahead to check the wait time, it is ALWAYS off sometimes in my favor, sometimes not but it drives me crazy. You may be busy but you are also turning people away. Get your table times in check. It's breakfast your table time should be about an hour, hour and half for a chatty table. You should be able to quote tables based on that time frame. I'll still visit but it is definitely not as often as I would like it to be because of this. 

Maybe another location on the East or Southeast side will spread the love out."}
{"text":"My wife brought me here, I wanted something else but I'm sure glad I ended up giving in to the wife. Pancakes are the best in town!!!! Glad I came in I'll definitely  be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my country egg Benedict's. It was a nice place and it was worth the $. Will definitely come back next visit I'm in Vegas. The pancakes are a must to try!!"}
{"text":"I am not really a breakfast food fan but I've heard tons of things about the RVPs, so I had to try them. I got read the reviews about how busy it is on the weekends, so I decided to call in my order. When I got there, there weren't many people so 8am on a Sunday seems good if you don't want to wait.

The red velvet pancakes are just okay. Almost like a dense piece of red velvet cake. The RVPs I had from IHOP are just as good. I also had bacon, eggs and hash browns, which were pretty standards. I did sneak a bite of the macadamia nut pancakes. They were amazing. Way better than the red velvet! 

If I am ever in the neighborhood I'll go again if the wait isn't too bad and I will just stick with a stack of the macadamia nut pancakes. It's definitely not worth going out of your way."}
{"text":"I went to the Centennial Hills location for breakfast today. My first time at any of these. I had the Piglet omelet with the \"seasoned\" potato's and toast. The omelet was pretty good, not great but not bad. The seasoned potato's turned out to be small pieces of deep fried steak fries, absolutely no seasoning. I got four halves of toast with just enough butter that I could barely see it with my reading glasses on. Don't expect any jelly or honey for it, \"they\" don't offer it. Last, the coffee was not bad just only warm when they first brought it out. I was not impressed, just amazed that they can stay in business. There are many much better places to go for breakfast people. Try them. Needless to say my first trip is also my last trip."}
{"text":"We got here shortly after they opened and there were at least 3 other parties seated. We were worried because we were in a hurry to eat and run. Once our order was taken, our drinks came out quickly as did our food. The food portions were generous at a great value. Everyone was courteous and efficient. My kind of place! Definitely a great place to hit if you're in the area. Plus: they were able to accommodate our group's diverse nutritional needs. Such big wins."}
{"text":"All I've heard about in terms of bangin breakfast has been Babycakes Cafe. The hoopla has been mainly about their red velvet pancakes, and since red velvet is my most favorite dessert, how could I pass up an opportunity to try it in breakfast form? 

From my understanding, the line to get in to this joint is typically outrageous, but little secret..on a Tuesday morning around 11AM, you'll have virtually no problem finding a seat in this strip mall hidden treasure. 

The restaurant itself is small which would explain the (typical) wait time to get a table. I have reduced my rating by a star due to this fact because the seating is awkward, the restaurant can be noisy and most seats in the house will have you facing the kitchen or hallway to the restroom. 

Moving right along.. The other half ordered some garlic infused omelet (I'm Italian, but garlic in the AM is just too much for me) complete with potatoes and a side of red velvet pancakes and I ordered their cinnamon bun pancakes and a side of scrambled eggs. 

Much to my surprise I quite enjoyed my cinnamon pancakes even better than the red velvet! But hey, if you forced me to eat either one, I wouldn't complain. 

All in all, food was delicious, service was great and should I ever be in the area again and there's not a line, I would happily indulge once again in the Babycakes extensive, festively flavored pancake menu."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes are seriously the best! We got a short stack to share and I'm so regretting we didn't get the full stack (I might have to stop by before I leave Vegas to get another). I had the chicken adobo fried rice omelette and was really impressed, different combination than I've seen, but it works. We got there at 1pm on a Tuesday so didn't have to wait.  :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town during President's Week and ventured off to find a good breakfast/brunch restaurant in the LV area. He's dined at this restaurant before and vouched that their pancakes are delicious, and I read reviews on Yelp that their red velvet pancakes with a cream cheese sauce on the side is their signature pancake dish.

We arrived on a Thursday morning. There was a 30 minute wait, but that was a good sign to me that this place is popular with the locals. We were seated in the time frame that they promised, and the server greeted us warmly.

The menu had many entrees, of course, and many of them pertained to pancake entrees. However, I noticed that they had an extensive option of Hawaiian based breakfast dishes (loco moco,fried rice, etc). I wanted to stick to a smaller breakfast since I had a large dinner on the previous day. We stuck to their pancake entrees.

He ordered pancakes with infused bacon bits (odd combo I know), and mine was the red velvet pancakes. We both ordered the half order of three pancakes instead of full.  Of course, I can't live without ordering home fries to balance my palette off with something salty. Plus, I just love potatoes -- carb addict, I know. My boyfriend recommended the potato chips, and I went with his recommendation.

When the red velvet pancakes arrived, the taste was on point. Every bite was simply amazing. They were fluffy, warm, and perfectly sweet. The cream cheese side complimented the dish beautifully. Not to mention, the whipped cream with chocolate flakes on top of the pancakes were a nice addition. Loved the dish.

The potato chips, on the other hand, were very oily and greasy. They were drenched in vegetable oil -- just gross. I didn't enjoy them at all. Very disappointing! I should've opted for the home fries.

When we went to pay our bill, their computer system was down, so some of the diners were left waiting. They were polite about it, and the short wait didn't bother us. They still managed to get their credit card system working, at least. 

I would definitely return when I'm in the area, but I'd rather get my potato fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...
I was super excited to try this place. I've heard and read great things about the food and FI-NA-LLY 
I made my way over and it wasn't even packed. Woohoo!

Our server Efrain was awesome! He was knowledgeable on the menu. When we asked for suggestions and which pancakes he personally liked, he was able to tell us without hesitation. 

My BF ordered the garlic fried rice, eggs and sausage & Peanut butter pancakes. He took one bite from his garlic rice and didn't like it. He also thought his pancakes were too dry. I got the fried rice adobo omelette and the hazelnut pancakes. The adobo fried rice would be so good if they cut half the salt. It was soooo salty, I could barely eat it. The pancakes...okay so, the pancake itself without all the toppings we're okay. I was hoping to have more of that hazelnut flavor within the pancake which I didn't. When you add back the toppings, it added more of the hazelnut taste. It was okay for me. Meh?

I don't think I'll be returning.                                
I'd rather go to Cinnamons across town

{"text":"I absolutely love breakfast food so this place has a little advantage there  cause it's kinda hard (in my opinion) to get breakfast food wrong.  But their red velvet pancakes are soooooo delicious, many of my coworkers have been talking about how much they love this place as well.  I had the kalua pig benedict and it did not dissapoint!"}
{"text":"I'd give this 5 stars, but they really need a larger space so that more people could be seated. My kids LOVE the German pancakes. My husband really likes the Loco Moco, and I just like a simple eggs/sausage/pancakes combo meal. If you like this place, you'll be back. If you want to try it for the first time, you'll wait the 30-40 minutes to be seated. Overall, we like it, but we have to be willing to wait to be seated in order to be motivated to go. What I love about Las Vegas is that there are plenty of breakfast places to eat at, so we have no shortage of that type of food here."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations going into this place and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't swept off my feet.  

I got an omelette, I forget what it was called, but it had avocado and bacon and cheese.  It was good!  It was a perfect portion for me.  The Cracked Egg has a much bigger portion but I end up with leftovers all the time anyway.  However, I am also a very small person.

I loved that it only cost a couple dollars extra to upgrade my pancakes from plain buttermilk to the.. of course.. RED VELVET PANCAKES.  Lol!

They were definitely good and pleasing and different however... just like my overall opinion of this place... nothing to go out of my way for.

The service was attentive, and the place was very small.  I went on a weekday morning so there was no wait but I can't imagine on a weekend morning!

Was pleased and will go back, but nothing I can see myself craving."}
{"text":"Affectionate 4 stars. Playful unique pancakes. I had the red velvet and it was worth every calorie. Also serves island style breakfasts. I had the adobo omelet and it was the best I've had in a long time. Went on a Tuesday morning and there was NO WAIT. Feels homey and everyone is real nice. The coffee wasn't good though. I didn't notice you pay at the register at the front and they had to tell me. I want to take my dad here."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Babystacks on a Saturday morning. The wait was not as long as you would imagine and it moved pretty fast. It was definitely busy though. Tried the Kalua Pig Benedict and my husband tried the Loco Moco. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Also split the Red Velvet Pancakes and they were also worth the wait. Not as sweet as I had imagined them being and a short stack was perfect for sharing. Looking forward to them opening their Henderson location. Will definitely be back and looking forward to trying more dishes on their large menu!!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. Have eaten here for over a year and the food is never quite the same as initially. I continue to patronize Babystacks BC when their food is right, it's outstanding.

With that being said, today's visit, was ugh. Ordered my routine dish. My eggs were undercooked and runny, bacon limp, cubed potatoes soft and the pancakes tasted like cardboard.

Thoroughly disappointed. Seems the cook rushed my food out instead of taking the time to make it properly. What about the customer experience?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone raves about the red velvet pancakes but I find them somewhat bland. If you want an amazing pancake, try the cinnobun or my current favorite, the orange creamsicle! Orange flavored pancakes served with an orange drizzle, whipped cream and a cream cheese frosting/syrup. If you're not a complete sweet tooth like me, try the lemon ricotta cakes, they are huge and amazing! 
The team here is very friendly and helpful too!"}
{"text":"Go to this place now! It's literally the best breakfast in town. My family and I try to go at least once a month and if there's a wait... just wait!! You won't be disappointed! Try the red velvet pancakes or the bananas fosters or really any of them because they are all amazing... we've never left hungry or dissatisfied in any way! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"What do I love about this place? The question should be, what don't I love about this place? 

We had Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - a traditional Filipino dish made with marinated, shredded chicken and rice wrapped omelet style with green onions, accompanied with their homemade macaroni salad. The omelet is exactly what one would expect, if you ever had adobo...VERY, VERY GOOD! The mac salad was a little salty for my taste, but still very good!

Their Kalua Pig Benedict - toasted English muffin, topped with Hawaiian-style, slow-cooked, shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce...A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  If benedicts are what you're looking for, this one tops them all. My absolute favorite!

Our son had their bacon cheeseburger, well done, and fries. My husband was quite pleased and surprised that, yet again, another great entree! 

Our daughter had their carrot cake pancakes. I love carrot cake to begin with, and I have to admit that it was even better than I thought!

To top everything off, we ordered their Red Velvet Pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. If pancakes are what you're looking for, anyone who's been here would, I'M SURE, highly recommend the Red Velvet. Words cannot even describe such a simple dish that is OH SO, well...you'll just have to try it!!!  

Don't think that we could eat all this. I'm actually sick to my stomach from all the amazing food! We packed up two take-home containers and went home to crash, but I wanted to take a moment to rate this restaurant. Definitely worth it. This being our first time there, we wanted to order so much off their menu to try what we heard/read rave reviews about, so we already knew we were \"taking leftovers\"...the question was, just how much?

Being New Year's Eve, it was really packed! They served us juice and coffee as we waited, which was extremely nice! You're happy with how their items are priced! Service was still very good for how busy it was.  EVERYONE, including us, walked out of there with a smile on their face. 

WHAT A GREAT FIND! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for breakfast/brunch!!! ENJOY! :)"}
{"text":"BabyStacks Cafe is in my breakfast rotation for restaurants. This location is about half the size of the one over on South Buffalo but is much closer to my home. Because of its size there always seems to be a wait, even during the week but the wait is worth it.

Like others have mentioned the Adobo Fried Rice is a great staple of this restaurant. They have a wonderful selection of pancakes. The fiance raves about the Kahlua Pork Benedict. He has never shared so I cannot comment on that. I would say that their garlic rice can be hit or miss. Some days it is extremely tasty but others it is very greasy and bland. The Portuguese sausage is on point though!"}
{"text":"I fully understand they we busy for Mothers Day but the waiting process to seat people did not make sense. We had a party of three waited 40 minutes to be seated. Party of two were seated almost immediately. Three seats open at bar daughter asked hostesses if we could sit at bar, she advise us she was going to offer other people waiting longer, that was fair.  About 15 minutes later three more bar seated opened hostess asked us if we wanted then we said yea after the 40 minute wait. Then same hostesses call a party of four who just walked in and sat them a table. I asked when happened to us, since we would took the bar seats and it was not clean she bypassed us. In my mind we should of been offer the table first before the bar. After I complained we got a table, no apology or anything from hostesses. Great food but getting seated it was a very negative experience. Would of been a four or five if manager or hostess said they we sorry."}
{"text":"It was okay but their pancakes were very sweet and heavy. Their eggs benedict were also only okay; the hawaiian was definitely better than their spinach benedict. The only thing that left me full were the pancakes. I would recommend getting a meal and then the two stack of replacement pancakes unless you're really craving pancakes. I will probably come back but there are other breakfast places that are higher on my list."}
{"text":"Popped in morning after grand opening in hopes of avoiding the inevitable crowds this place  will be having. We were fortunate to only be sharing the place  with only 5 other parties
Service was efficient and friendly. Establishment clean and pleasant. They keep their music at a very acceptable level.
We tried the Red Velvet  with cream cheese syrup stack and the banana stack. Both were excellent. I hope try all 12 of their stacks eventually.
The eggs and hash browns and were also delicious.
This is a great breakfast/lunch place that we will frequent."}
{"text":"Eyelash in my food. When I got 1/4 way through one of my pancakes in my short stack I realized there was only 2 pancakes not 3 and then when I mentioned it to the waiter he said there was three, and when I gently mentioned I'm pretty sure there wasn't, I don't think I eat that fast, he still said there was 3, a manager did fix the problem but what ever happened to the customer is always right... oh and the wife got sick shortly after eating here... yea, we won't be back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes, & lemon ricotta pancakes delicious!
Next, banana cream pie pancakes.
Staff is friendly but a little slow when we were there.
This is not for the Vegas tourist if you like the strip. It is where the locals eat and it's fabulous."}
{"text":"The wait to get in was incredibly long, but once you order and get your food, it's totally worth it. Ordered the Kalua grilled cheese, lemon ricotta crepes, and Cookie Butter french toast and it was all so rich, we couldn't finish our meals! 

If you're okay waiting a while, go for it!"}
{"text":"Liliana our server was awesome !! Amazing customer service . Staff very friendly, and most importantly the food is amazing . It was me and boyfriends first time here,  we come from San Diego.  I really recommend this place.  Delicious,  thanks Liliana for the amazing service. We have been having horrible service everywhere else , we will definitely be coming back ."}
{"text":"The food here is unreal!
My boyfriend and I popped in on Christmas morning while visiting family and boy we are so glad we did. He had the chili omelette and I had the piglet skillet. The staff was friendly and accommodated all of our special requests. We will be returning anytime we are in town!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the hash browns.    I had the breakfast burrito and it really does amaze and is well worth it.  Try it with Swiss and  portuguese sausage."}
{"text":"We ordered the double fried rice omelette thing, eggs Benedict, and the Nutella crepes with banana. App very good. Worth the trip from the strip!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try their red velvet pancakes a few years back but never got the chance to. And I'm glad it didn't disappoint me!!! We chose this location cause it was closer out of 3?

We got two orders to share among the two of us. One was baby chick omelet and the other was red velvet pancakes. Us two don't eat much so it was perfect. Might be not enough for those who eat a lot. 

We ordered short so it came with 3 pancakes only. Full order would be 5. I don't like cream on my pancakes so I asked for it on the side. I'm glad I did cause the pancake was sweet enough by itself. The powder was different from most pancakes. More moist? But I love it!! 

The omelet was not bad either. I forgot what topping was in it but it was flavorful. I love their seasoning potatoes! Just perfectly crispy and not too salty. 

Service was a tad slow but they were busy also. Definitely friendly people though! I guess this place could replace my breakfast at Hash House A Go Go after all."}
{"text":"I had the cinna bun pancakes were perfect iam a regular here now best breakfast n vegas"}
{"text":"I got here at 11:15 and my food just being served.  Disappointed and the service was terribly slow.  Hostesses may or may not be high school grads.  I was let down."}
{"text":"Giving this place TWO stars because the food was great- but the service was horrible. I was told that it was a 20 minute wait for a table for 3, which I was fine with- but after 35 mins, I asked if I had been called and maybe I didn't hear it- but then when the hostess looked at her list, they had seated TEN tables after my name which were 2 seaters and a FIVE table. I understand that the hostesses can't magically make tables appear or kick people out, so I figured- we waited this long- what's a few more minutes right??? but finally after 50 minutes total- we were able to sit down. The waitress came to take our order and someone else came to drop off the food- but when they dropped off the food we got our eggs first, then pancakes later then bacon last... Nothing came at the same time LOL! When we needed silverware, napkins, our missing coffee that never came, and water refills we had to flag down people. For as good as the food is there, we won't be going back due to poor service... We only stayed bc my dad was SUPER hungry and had to go to work right after..."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent. I ordered the chili moco with Kalua pork added. It would've been even better if they made their own hamburger patty. I could tell it was a premade frozen patty. The husband ordered the Adobo fried rice omelet. It was good and big. I would've like it to have a more vinegary flavor. But I would come back to try the Kalua pig Benedict."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good nice had 
Breakfast at 2 locations and both times I was highly disappointed.  God tasted like it sat under a warmer for awhile. Not fresh at all. Henderson location had horrible
Customer service and food and the other location in NLV good customer service but bad food."}
{"text":"I am a fitness professional and fitness model and this place makes it very hard to stay on my diet.... the red velvet pancakes are the best. As is the buttermilk bacon pancakes. They actually pour the batter right on top of freshly broken up pieces of real breakfast bacon then slap it on your plate with a smile... makes me smile too ! !"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but overcrowded. Got there at 1:20 (Sunday they close at 3pm) and the doors were already locked."}
{"text":"Cane here and they were packed, got seated right away. Had a full stack of carrot cake and orange dreamsicle, just amazing, 6 large Fluffy pancakes on each plate. I totally suggest going here alone for their wide selection of flavors."}
{"text":"This one of favorite places to eat in Vegas by far, I consider myself lucky to live close by to one of their locations. The food is great, the different pancakes types are amazing with the Red Velvet, Banana Cream Pie and My favorite is the German Chocolate(which might be a limited run). The non pancake items on the menu are fantastic as well. I enjoy the Mexican skillet with sour cream or the country fried steak. The service is always nice there. They definitely get busy, so be prepared for a wait but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"I first had BabyStacks when they had only one location- North Las Vegas. I remember my friend taking me there and he told me to get the Red Velvet pancakes because they were to die for! Of course, I ordered it to see what it's all about and I am so glad I did! It has to be one of my favorite things to eat and one of my guilty pleasures! Ever since then, I always opted to go back, but because it was too far from where I lived, going there was usually only on very special occasions such as friends or relatives from out of town and they want a \"local fav\" breakfast joint. 

After BabyStacks being so successful, they finally opened a new location right across from my old high school! I frequent now at the Buffalo/Flamingo location because its so close and convenient. Come early when they open because lines will get long! 

My typical orders:

Red Velvet pancakes
Peanut butter & banana pancakes
Rocky road pancakes

These are my top three favorites. They are so good and more dessert like. I usually order my pancakes last because I need something fulfilling to eat at breakfast rather than sweets.

Build your own omelets- I'm a sucker for omelets. I love the option of building my own only for less than $10!

BabyStacks is a Hawaiian/Asian style breakfast joint so a lot of the dishes have rice, spam and macaroni. It tastes a lot like home to me. The portions are huge and very fulfilling!

If you are a local or even from out of town, I recommend this place if you haven't had it yet!"}
{"text":"Overrated! The first time got the red velvet pancakes. Those were great. Second time, bf and I shared a short stack of carrot and white chocolate pancakes. Got the grilled cheese special with pork and the adobo fried rice omelet. It was all ok. Carrot pancakes had a nasty after taste and could only eat with the sauce. They might as well called the grilled cheese with pork a pork sandwich. It barely had any cheese and almost all pork. Not good at all! The only thing I kind of liked was the adobo fried rice but it doesn't even compare to aloha kitchen. Service was good. But I would not come back unless I was craving red velvet pancakes. I am not a morning person at all. But I would have preferred another place."}
{"text":"Other then being super busy. Great food and service. A lot of options to choose from. Would definitely recommend. Just get there early."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't really see what the hype is about this place. The food is ok. Nothing to write home about, but not bad either. The pancakes which seems to be their \"claim to fame\" didn't taste any different than the ones from IHOP or Dennys. Sometimes I think people just assume that a place is good based on the wait. Kind of like a placebo effect. The atmosphere feels like a cafeteria. Really bright lighting. The seating is by no stretch of the imagination comfortable, it's extremely loud, and tables are super close together. Don't plan on having any sort of conversation with your dining partner. I've been there twice now and the service wasn't great. Here's what bugged me both times. I like buttery pancakes. Both times, I get a stack of pancakes with ONE of those little pats of butter that comes in a foil wrap - like the kind they serve with bread at other restaurants. And one tiny little shot glass sized container of syrup. Both times I ask for extra butter and syrup and the waiter literally comes back with ONE MORE pat of butter and another shot glass full of syrup. Come on guys! Is it really that expensive to bring out a little dish of butters? Really, I'd prefer a little container of whipped butter like most places give but the pats will do- just don't be so damn cheap with them. You should get at least as many butters as you have pancakes. 3 pancakes = 3 butters. The last time we went, first my drink order was wrong and they also brought me out the wrong omelet. Granted the waiter was apologetic and took care of it, but still. Oh, and they only serve Pepsi products- blech."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Filling portions. Def get the red velvet pancakes if u got a bit of a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Food is good red velvet pancakes were great but the customer service sucks the cashier was rude when I asked for a table in back and what she was wearing looked bad lose some weight before wearing tight jeans you will make this place lose customers your rude to guests I watched you can't believe the way you  talk to people I won't be back get nice people to work and I might come back they are not kid friendly"}
{"text":"Great place. First time we went & waited for around 40min to be seated. Well worth the wait. Second time I called in to pick up our order. We prefer to eat in but nevertheless they have great food & are reasonably priced. We own a restaurant ourselves & know very well how it is to provide great food & a great experience. 
We're also glad to see that they don't do grub hub or any of the other 3rd party services that take 30% of the sale. These people deserve every penny for their hard efforts. Thank you Baby Stacks we'll be back again & again."}
{"text":"These pancakes are very original and tasty! I also tried the veggie skillet which was smaller than I would have liked but it was delicious. The area is very small and usually you have to wait for 15-20 minutes for a seating. They were very good on refilling your water and the customer service was great. They always check up on you to make sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Babystacks. Their food is always yummy and I enjoy taking my kids here. 

Today...

I ordered chili moco with a side of their tiramisu pancakes. The flavor and taste was just fine. The presentation, however was terrible. I have never had an issue with this, but I don't know what happened today. We were there around 10:00 and it was busy, but I don't think that's an excuse. My food was practically falling off my plate and it wasn't because there was tons of food. It looked pretty unappealing. See picture. I will be back, but I'm hoping this was only a one time thing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the world. I'm half Filipino, so I always get a Rick's Adobo Omelet, which is a wonderful for anyone who enjoys adobo and rice wrapped in a giant omelet. 

The pancakes are amazing. I day dream about the red velvet pancakes from here on a daily basis. Not only are the red velvet pancakes good, but any of the other pancakes are delicious, too. 

My one piece of advice is for dine-in people to get there a bit early. Lots of people know how great it is to eat here, so it might be a long wait until you get seated and eating at a table."}
{"text":"BabyStacks Cafe is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast, but unfortunately I have had to turn away from it on several occasions due to the long wait, which seems almost unavoidable. Each time I come here, I try to order something different off the menu, but I have got to say my absolute favorite things to order are the adobo fried rice omelet and the red velvet pancakes. The only thing I was a little disappointed in upon ordering was the macadamia nut pancakes. Having had authentic Hawaiian macadamia nut pancakes with the sauce all over the top, I think I kind of had high expectations. I personally couldn't taste much of the macadamia nut flavor and felt as though I was eating a regular stack of pancakes."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites every time I come through Vegas. The crepes and Pancake creations are the best in town."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place and wish they were open late. I haven't tried a single thing on the menu that I haven't loved. The only downside is it gets so packed since it's a smaller venue, but the service is quick and tables turnaround fairly fast."}
{"text":"My first time here, I tried the kalua pig eggs benedict and it was pretty good but next time I think I'll get the hollandaise sauce on the side since the muffins were drenched. The second time I came here, I tried the red velvet pancakes with portuguese sausage. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced but I wish this place was open all day to serve breakfast, hence the 4 stars. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The babystacks selection is great.  Tried a few and they were all yummy.  Will come back to try more.
The portions are good, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious,  will definitely be back when we are in town, OMG, pancakes delicious,  food, atmosphere and service on point."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Home made tasting and friendly crew. The wait is long ( always) cause it's a small establishment and good food. But if you are not in a rush and want super good food, you gotta try this place. The adoba ( or something like that) omelet I had and bananas foster pancakes, holy crap those were good! I've never finished pancakes at a restaurant cause they don't taste homemade, but I finished every bite! Try this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican omelette with extra avocado. Ohhh it was heavenly. My friend ordered ordered spam, eggs, and rice. Ohhh, it was so delicious. Oh, I love spam, eggs, and rice. Any place that makes this AND makes it well - 5*! The Mexican omelette was outstanding, because all of the ingredients tasted fresh, and the extra avocado? PERFECTION. 

The spam was nice and crispy, the eggs were over-easy, and perfectly done. The rice was nice and sticky, and altogether, it was heavenly. I miss this place. I wish they had more places like this here. I am not a pancake person, so i didn't bother with them, but I saw people ordering them, and their faces told it all after they ate them."}
{"text":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen!  I arrived here around 8:10am and was seated relatively promptly.  My order was taken and water on my table by 8:15am.  This is where this turned from a great experience to a bad one.  

I know that this is a relatively small eatery.  It's a mom and pop type business.  The pancakes were good--  a tad too chocolatety... More so than I remember, but I could have just been in a bad mood after waiting 1/2 hour for pancakes.  Are you kidding me?  I'm a solo diner.  I watch full stacks brought out to the table to the right of me and short stacks to my left--literally.  If it didn't take me 1/2 hour to get there, I would have left.  Finally, my waitress notices \"Hmmm... I think she probably came here to eat\" and asked the kitchen where my food was.  They start to argue about if it was put in or not.  I'm thinking, \"Hey, I'm sitting right next to you guys. Can you be more discrete?\"  So they start making the pancakes.  Do I get an apology, an explanation, a \"are you still doing alright\", \"your food will be out in a bit\", or at least some water in my empty glass? You guessed it... No!  That was the insulting part.

Look, I eat out a lot.  I do probably more than I should.  I know that things happen and mistakes are made.  That's absolutely fine.  There will be some human error.  What is not acceptable is keeping the patron in the dark-- especially if I can hear the whole he said/she said conversation... This right here is where restaurants are defined, and this place failed miserably.  To add insult to injury, they put the check on my table literally 3 minutes after I got my food.  I eat fast but really?  Again, really?  You've got to be kidding me.  

I WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE AGAIN!  They need to hire someone to teach them how to run front of house or at least get some manners."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on a recent vacation and it was fantastic! The staff was very friendly, it was clean, and the food was off the charts delicious. Will definitely go again next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"i am a HUGE pancake/waffle fanatic. a friend of mines, who lives in las vegas, kept talking about babystacks red velvet pancake. i wanted to see what the hype was all about, so he took me there for brunch.

i admit, it's pretty darn good. i fell in love with the fluffy, red pancakes drizzled with cream cheese syrup. it definitely fulfilled my sweet tooth.

can't wait to come back to try some of their other specialty pancakes."}
{"text":"If you is Vegas you must try this Restaurant! They have the best food in town Hands down, they are not to pricey! You get good portions and they staff is always friendly and consistent!"}
{"text":"Did someone say BABYSTACKS?!

They have a wide variety of food on the menu, but I usually only get a short stack of pancakes with a side of something else. Portuguese sausages are my favorite. I would suggest you try other pancakes BEFORE the red velvet pancakes because once you try those, it's all game over. You wont want anything but. It's also very affordable. I have yet to try the Nutella crepes, although they look decadent. 

The place is a bit cramped and would like to see it bigger. The wait time can also tend to be quite long if you get there around 10-11.

I'm excited for the Centennial location to open; I'll be plastered at the door like a puppy to be the first customer.."}
{"text":"Everything we got was great. Banana cream crepe and Nutella crepe were delicious. Carrot cake pancakes with the cream cheese \"syrup\" or should I say,frosting? Was great too. 

Hubby got spam Benedict on Hawaiian bread. He said he loved that as well."}
{"text":"It's Easter morning and it's time to EAT!! I decided we should finally check this place out. I've heard great reviews about them and Red Velvet pancakes sounded GREAT! 
Hunnie Bunnie got the short stack (3) of chocolate chip pancakes and she LOOOOVED them. 
I ordered the breakfast plate of Portuguese sausage and eggs. It comes with buttermilk pancakes which I upgraded to the Red Velvet pancakes and potatoes or steamed rice which I upgraded to the Garlic Rice. Obviously. I LOVE me some garlic!! 
Everything was GOOD! The Red Velvet pancakes are served with like a cream cheese sauce and whip cream on top. I didn't eat much of these cuz I was concentrating on my sausage and eggs - we boxed up the pancakes and then I forgot all about them so I had to throw them out! BOO!!! I loved the rice though and everything else was NOM too!"}
{"text":"My family comes here every weekend. People complain about the wait, well guess what, it's as it down breakfast/lunch joint, not fast food. Go to McDonald's if you're going to be an impatient jerk. The staff have become family, greeted with hugs every time. If you're looking for something different, then sit down, wait, then enjoy!"}
{"text":"They probably have the best breakfast place to go to, but the wait to be seated are so long, my girlfriend and siblings and i waited 2 freaking hours just to be seated... its freaking insane! I hope by writing this review, they need to improved what i am concerned about. I hate to wait specially if im really hungry and hoping to eat as soon as i can. And its ridiculous how they know its busy around brunch time, they need to improve it. But overall the workers are great and so does their food."}
{"text":"It's been the second time around this week I've been here, first time this week - Thursday am w my co-workers after a 12 hrs shift they brought me here & they weren't kidding!!! I had the loco moco w a garlic fried rice, it was delicious & finished it all, then ate all of my white macadenia pancake, superb !!! I promised myself that I would bring my kids here to try it bc I'm sure that I won't be disappointing them.  So i came back w them today- halloween breakfast & got 4 different mouth watering pancakes as our sides. No need to describe how good the food are, I've provided a pictures for u to drool on!!!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is simply among the best if you're looking for a delicious/greasy/filling/plentiful breakfast after a long night. There are several unique items on their menu you won't find at other breakfast places (like Portuguese sausage). The pancakes-- as mentioned in just about every review here, the red velvet pancakes are amazing...but honestly you can't go wrong on any of their specialty pancakes. I will say that the service is not great and a few of their policies aren't the friendliest (no seating until your whole party has arrived, no splitting checks), but these drawbacks are more than made up for in the food, which is my ultimate reason for going to a restaurant! I will gladly put up with mediocre service so long as the food is great, which it assuredly is at Babystacks."}
{"text":"I just visited this place for the second time and what can I say?!  This place is fucking great!  So far I've only had the Piglet omelet which consists of sausage, ham and bacon with seasoned potatoes.  I've also had the eggs with portuguese sausage which was really good too. 

But lets face it, we come here for the pancakes!!  These things are phenomenal!  The first time I tried the Red Velvet short stack which was incredible.  On my second visit I had the Carrot Cakes and holy hell where they awesome!!  It was like eating carrot cake which I love, without the consistency of the cake, but the softness of the pancake!

The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the regular breakfast, although good, is just regular breakfast.  Nothing to special about it.  But like I said, its all about the pancakes here, and those get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I've eaten at the buffalo and smoke ranch location and both locations are great!!  I love the potatoes I don't like eggs so I just order the Mexican skillet without eggs and it's delicious!!  My boyfriend always orders the Huntington!!  We come here at least once a week!!  Definitely one of the best breakfast places I've found in vegas!!  If you come early enough you don't have to wait but plan on waiting a while if you come around noon!!  It's worth the wait anyways!!"}
{"text":"If you get here around 7am you will have no wait so that's the best time to come here!!  The food is always delicious!!  Red velvet carrot, & bananas foster pancakes are what I e tried so far and they are all delicious!!  The service is always great too!"}
{"text":"Late breakfast/early lunch on a Saturday. Place was very busy but got seated quickly. Great service, large menu. A lot of different food than normal cafes with it leaning towards a Hawaiian/Polynesian profile. The selection of pancakes is impressive. Good prices. I will return."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday and ordered the Mexican Scramble and the strawberry pancakes. My scramble was mediocre because the potatoes we soggy and the cheese which was the consistency of dried glue. My order had definitely been sitting for some time and was not prepared fresh as it had been on my previous visit. The pancakes were great however, and the service was good."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. All hype. The seasoned potatoes were good since they weren't greasy, so I'll give them 2 stars for that. The server was cold and not attentive at all. The pancakes (smores) were dry and unremarkable. I make much better myself at home. Not worth the 50+ minute wait."}
{"text":"My kids always want to eat here and I would take them more often but hate the wait!
Only downfall is they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS!!!!!
Great menu selection. I love their corned beef hash! They make it the way I love it! Crispy! Not all wet and mushy!!!! Thank you for that! Lol. I also like their Loco Moco! Good gravy! 
My kids love their specialty pancakes and their Hawaiian Benedict. They love spam and if you do too you should try it! 
I love their garlic fried rice but I don't like  that they up charge just to fry your rice and add 10 cents worth of garlic and onions, it should just be a complimentary option. Just saying. 
Overall this place is yummy!!! :)"}
{"text":"This is one the best breakfast spots in town. Because of this, you can expect a wait time of 20-30 minutes every day. The place is small, but has plenty of solid food options to choose from. 

I tried the loco moco breakfast which was scrambled eggs, white rice, a hamburger patty, and delicious brown gravy over the top. I also chose to replace the macaroni salad with hash browns. My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy with seasoned potatoes. Her plate arrived  with 3 massive biscuits and a white gravy that had bits of sausage throughout. 

We topped off our order with a short stack of their red velvet pancakes. WOW-- these are great. However, a little too sweet for me to eat as an entire breakfast. My 3 year old son could not stop talking about these red pancakes, and even wanted them for dinner that same day.

Service is efficient, and the staff is friendly. Our bill came out to $28.00  not including tip."}
{"text":"I live just a few blocks away, this is our go to breakfast nook! 

EVERYTHING is great here, the red velvet pancakes are my FAVORITE. I hope they expand but stay in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week, which is a lot considering I seldom go out for breakfast! The wait is usually quite a while since it's always so busy and there is always a long line. The breakfast choices are pretty average, nothing special, pretty similar to a few other breakfast places and kind of pricey. Babystacks are known for their pancakes, though! I've tried both the orange creamsicle and Nutella pancakes (both are amazing!) but the former was more favorable. I'll definitely be coming back, but the wait is really a pain, so be sure to bring something or someone to entertain you!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!!!  So far the best breakfast spot me and my sister found!  We ordered the adobo fried rice omelet and short stack red velvet pancakes and both were sooooo gooood!!!!!  Prices are so good, too!  

We arrived around 10 with a wait of about 10-15 minutes which isn't bad at all.  Parking and location was easy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Their red velvet pancakes are a must try.  So yummy! 
This place is good, hence it's busy.  If you're in a rush, this may not be the place for you.  Your loss.  For those of us who are patient,  I raise a coffee cup to your red velvetness."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. I strongly recommend the adobo omelet that is filled with fried rice. The overall place is wonderful for breakfast or lunch. My little sister and friends loved the pancakes. How you can choose different flavors for the pancakes than just buttermilk. Such as strawberry, blueberry, many many different options."}
{"text":"We took family from out of town here and they loved it! We each tried a different kind of pancake and shared.  Our favorite was German Chocolate.  They said it needed to be a new tradition.  Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Looks ragged from outside but cool vibe on the inside. My boyfriend and I both got a combo plate - I got an omelette with the potatoes (definitely potatoes over hash browns) and the special of the day gingerbread pancakes. Pancakes were a little rich for me but probably would be better for someone else who likes super sweet breakfast. He got ham/eggs and banana pancakes - these pancakes were much better. I'd just get a less fancy pancake. Service was great and timely!"}
{"text":"We were in the area for a couples massage and stopped in for breakfast thanks to Yelp.
What a great find!  You could tell upon walking in that this was a local favorite.  We managed to get seated in the last table for two.  After us there was a wait.  The menu was fantastic!  Not only did they have the standard breakfast favorites of pancakes and eggs but they had garlic fried rice.  Ohhhhh...they had me at garlic.   I end up ordering the loco moco and was not disappointed.  Rice, hambuger and gravy...you can't go wrong with that!  The hubby ordered himself some garlic fried rice with corned beef.  You could smell the garlic before the plate even reached the table.  I love that!  We left there full and happy."}
{"text":"Baby Stacks is our fav breakfast place when in LV.  This was our first time to this location, but the food was just as good as the other location.  I ordered the Loco Moco (as always) with garlic rice and Red Velvet Pancakes.  So good but too much food.  You leave there with a food coma AND a food baby.  The place is quite popular among locals and tourist so be prepared to wait for a table.  It is SOOOOO worth it though.  Love, love, love Baby Stacks!!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, wasn't hot when it got to the table...more like lukewarm. It wasn't busy either so idk why.. it tasted ok. There were lots of options as far as pancakes, but definitely way too sweet for me. The service was good, everyone was really nice and friendly. I probably wouldn't go again only because it wasn't that memorable. My son loves his smores pancakes tho"}
{"text":"I was told that because my wife wasn't here yet, she was going to be here in 10 minutes, that they would not seat me until she was there. I mean I understand why they do this because it's a tiny tiny restaurant but maybe they should reconsider getting a bigger location. The great thing is however that this is Las Vegas and there are a ton of great breakfast places to go to off to Cracker Barrel!!!"}
{"text":"New rule.. They refuse to seat you even though most parties are there (only 1 missing). Very inconvenient with so many seats available to just sit uncomfortably at the front. can't even enjoy a cup of coffee. Adobo fried rice is too salty. Aloha kitchen at Maryland parkway is still the best. loco moco gravy is too salty. Might as well go to L&L AND they server more."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Baby Stacks today for the first-time.  The red velvet pancaakes were OUTSTANDING!!  I wasn't sure if the cream cheese syrup would work for me, but it did and how. The service was excellent..friendly and efficient.  I was a party of one  and got seated immediately, but I noticed others had to wait.  They gladly accepted my discount certificate.  It was a wonderful dining experience and I will return again even though it's a 20-mile drive to get there."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Menu has changed and service has slowed to a crawl. Waited one hour at 10.30am on a quiet Tuesday. 
The special was corned beef hash burrito. Absolutely flavorless. When paying the bill the hostess asked 'how was everything?'  When I told her about the burrito she said 'oh I don't like that one, in fact nobody does!'  
I had requested a side of avocado that didn't show up but was on the bill. No jelly with the toast. 
Just lost its place..."}
{"text":"When those Beautiful red velvet pancakes come out, I devour every bite. The cream cheese syrup complements the pancake. But the pancake tests great by it's self. They have rice instead of potato and portuguese Sausage. 

The only complaint is that the restaurant is small and there is a crazy wait on sat and sun."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the Portuguese sausage and the red velvet pancakes. The only issue is that I eat the sausage, eggs and rice and I have only a little room for the pancakes. The cream cheese syrup is the perfect consistency and the whip cream is to die for. When I come to Las Vegas, I make a special trip here. Expect a small wait. We were able to score 3 seats at the counter and that helped with the wait."}
{"text":"I was driving down Buffalo and came across this place.  Boy am I glad I stopped by.

OMG! This place is the bomb diggity! Never expected the food to be so delicious!  It's like an explosion of flavors in your mouth! The red velvet pancake is to die for. 

I'm from Hawaii so it was a surprise to see Hawaiian dishes served here.  To all the Hawaiians in Las Vegas this place give Cinnamons Restaurant HARD RUBS! Plus they serve Zippy's Chilli here!!! I tried the Adobe Fried Rice Omelette and the Kailua Pig Benedict! A+ in my books!

The staff was wonderful! Very friendly and very prompt.  They filled our drinks when needed and provided a smile every time they came by.  

I know this is random but their water was so good! Very Cold and tasted fresh! That is also a plus for me when checking out a new restaurant as you know you don't always want to get drinks. So rest assured if you want water here your gonna have a good one. 

Price is very reasonable for the taste your are going to receive.  The portions are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go!

I had a great overall experience as a first timer.  I don't live next to this area but with the results of having a friendly staff, amazing food, and decent prices I will not hesitate to take a drive to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Bananas foster pancakes is to die for! Walked in at 7 and it was so busy. Had one waiter and he did a great job!! Food is fresh and great quality. Best place to get breakfast!!"}
{"text":"First time here arrived about 9:15. It was perfect no wait. Quick service. Our waitress Maria was super awesome. We had the spinach Benedicts super yummy, eggs cooked to perfection with seasoned potatoes and the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes. Everything was good. For some extra goodness we mixed the cholula and Tabasco sauce together and dipped our seasoned potatoes and Benedict.  Yummers."}
{"text":"I wish I knew what the hype was all about. I've been in and out of the valley for years and had always wanted to try this place for the Red Velvet Pancakes. I hate to say but I was soooo disappointed!  The neon color in the inside was the first concern and then they had such a strange taste; nothing like red velvet in my opinion. Our omelets and skillets were either really salty or had zero flavor. I will say the seasoned potatoes were good and the sourdough toast is alright. Overall I would suggest The Cracked Egg over the wait for this place."}
{"text":"I love their fooooood!!! I think I can eat here every weekend if it didn't mean gaining weight. After I eat all the food I feel super guilty and need to make a trip to the gym lol. This is a smaller location so there is usually a wait. Either come really early, in the afternoon, or get it to-go. Honestly, everything I've tried is really good. The omelettes, pancakes, and adobo fried rice is yum. I recommend the Cookie Butter French Toast and garlic fried rice, if anything. Service is prompt, but cramped inside."}
{"text":"I guess this place is known for specialty pancakes but we went after wanting to try this place for a few months. Judging by the wait lines we also see, we had high hopes.

I ordered an omelette, side of hash browns well done and the side of baby stack pancakes. My husband ordered eggs Benedict. My hash browns were undercooked. The omelette was very pedestrian, smallish with tiny pieces of diced meats that were indistinguishable from each other (bacon, sausage and ham). Pancakes were nothing special, actually pretty dry. Black Bear Diner is THE place to go for pancakes for sure. 

My husband's eggs Benedict was way over cooked. Eggs were on the hard side, not poached and runny at all. The Hollandaise had so much lemon it, it was almost curdled. This place may only know Hawaiian food but we'll never be back to find out.  Not sure if it's crowded because people are too lazy to drive any further or if they just don't know better."}
{"text":"Don't let the small place or cute name fool you.  Great breakfast spot and a little Hawaiian Filipino flavor as well.  The variety of pancakes is enough to warrant multiple visits.

The Adobo Fried Rice omelet its really good as well as the Kalua Pig Benedict.

Get here early or later unless you want to wait a little bit."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty toppings. Pancakes weren't the best. Price for everything was fantastic! 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Been several times & never have had to wait Guess I'm just lucky? Anywho, really good pancakes. Taste like moist pieces of cake to me than anything. Food always hits the spot"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always good. They have great skillets and if you love pancakes thats the place to go. They probably have more than 15 different kinds of pancakes. Red Velvet is yummy :)"}
{"text":"When my family and I come to Vegas we ALWAYS have to stop by BabyStacks cafe. It smacks here so make sure you get there early or you could be waiting for up to an hour depending on how many people in your party. The pancakes are heaven! Their seasoned house potatoes are delicious and crispy! And their adobo fried rice is fire! Too bad they don't have it in California, especially in the Bay Area. If they did it would be my number one breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I'll admit it, I hate giving out 5 stars.  I'm just so stingy, I think 5 out of 5 should be  reserved for near perfection.  I had no choice Baby Stacks.  You left me no out.  5 out of 5 it is.

  The people have spoken.  And they said they want red velvet pancakes from Baby Stacks Cafe.  So who am I to argue?  For my first trip to this highly recommended breakfast stop, I got the velvet short-stack along with a side of scrambled eggs and a glass of milk.  Very basic.

FOOD:  The short-stack was 3 smaller thick pancakes, which was just right for me to feel full but not disgusted with myself.  I've never had red velvet pancakes, but why haven't I heard of this sooner?!  It's one of the most delicious things on earth.  The perfect sweetness, texture, toppings - man, I just can't do these things justice.  Trust me when I say they are straight from heaven.  

SERVICE: The only thing sweeter than my short-stack was my server.  \"Yvette\" I believe was her name, a young Hawaiian-looking girl with the happiest attitude without a hint of fakeness.  She was smiley, quick to greet and take my order, always asking if there was anything else she could do, checking up on me just right.  And my food came out ridiculously quick.  I was pleasantly impressed!

DECOR:  The restaurant is fairly small, but cozy, clean, refreshing, and new in appearance.  You can tell someone took pride in it.  The small bar style seating area was neat.  There was a TV.  Soothing, light, uplifting music.  Very nice colors, plants, decorations, new furniture (tables and booths) and overall just extremely well taken care of.

I honestly can't find a single negative thing to say.  It was such a nice breakfast.  They really earned my stingy 5 star rating!  I wish it was next door to my apartment!"}
{"text":"BabyStacks! Get some pancakes, upgrade if you order something else! 

There is a huge selection of pretty unique pancakes and flavors. I got the macadamia nut & white chocolate, it was okay but the banana cream pie looked so good :O

Adobo Fried Rice was a generous portion and done well. First time here and I'm a fan, will come back to try some more food."}
{"text":"2 people I respect and learned to love worked here and said DON'T EAT HERE! The acting manager doesn't understand English. Ignorance is bliss here!  She went from one table speaking English well to no Bueno with complaining customers! Rude lady who doesn't care to fix! If u complain she will tell you.. YOU CAN LEAVE!"}
{"text":"Establishments deserving of the 5 star rating are seldom but this joint earned it because those Red Velvet pancakes are just off the hook.  Man, I'm salavating just thinking about them.

All the other dishes that are good (and some okay ones) have already been described by other yelpes so I'm putting the emphasis on those pancakes (yummmmmmmm).  When you're around the area, give them a try.  You'll definitely be wanting more."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more, but the food was just meh for me.

The side orders of sausages, eggs, etc. were not worth it for the price.  Simply, just go for the main dishes... which I did as well.  The omelets were flavorful, but their take on whole wheat french toast was unexpected.  I really wanted some soft and succulent french toast, but when I was presented with 3 pieces of hard fried looking bread, I was surprised.  I'd skip that dish. 

If I were here again, I'd probably go for the pancakes like everyone else does.  I was just hoping that all the other dishes were good as well.  Also, be prepared for a short wait when you check in."}
{"text":"Trying to have breakfast with some friends and we like to get separate checks to make it easier. Well, there is a big tacky sign on the front door saying they won't separate checks. 

So we kindly ask the waitress for a one time exception because we didn't know, and their answer is no, no way. 

Stupid idiotic policy that really upsets me. I will not be back. Oh, the food sucked, too."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I think it was okay.  This trip, we got the kahula pork eggs benedict and the adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg.  The eggs benedict was nice but lacking someting...maybe a sauce or soemthing.  it was kinda on the bland side.  The adobo fried rice was okay, alittle greasy for me.  I got the coffee here and it was very weak - would not get it here again.

The first time I came here, we had the herb house potatoes and didn't care for them, so I went for the hashbroowns this time.

If you want to try something different and wants a breakfast with a filipino / hawaiian twist, check it out.  I just thought it was ok."}
{"text":"What a great bkfst spot!

Pros:
- Everything tasted homemade
- Friendly staff
- Red velvet pancakes were delicious! Not overly sweet. The cream cheese \"syrup\" was a nice complement to the moist cakes.
- budget-friendly, family-friendly
- go for the garlic rice as a side (goes great with over-easy eggs)
- don't come here if you're trying to watch your weight or have food issues. If you're going to be high-maintenance, stay home & eat a gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free thingy.

Cons:
- Food could be hotter. Our meals came out lukewarm. Not a deal breaker. Just request that your meal is served hot, that is if that's how you like it."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas, I have to come to Babystacks with my family. It's a small restaurant that does not take reservations, goes on a first come, first serve basis and your whole party must be there in order to be sat. Understandable. I put my name down for 5 people, the hostess told me it was a 20-25 min wait. 15 mins later, she asked if my whole party was here yet. I responded \"They're exiting the freeway right now so probably another 5 mins.\" The hostess looked at me with a disgusted expression and blatantly rolled her eyes. I know your whole party must be present to be sat, so I would have understood if she had to skip over my name. I totally get that it's one of your busier days but the level of customer service that I received from the hostess was unsatisfactory. My server was really nice and attentive so it really made up for the shitty hostess. Hopefully next time I visit, she fixes her attitude."}
{"text":"Wow! Red velvet pancakes were awesome! The service was great, the portions were large and the food was awesome! We have lived in Las Vegas for a few years and have been looking for great breakfast places and this one hot the mark. So excited to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Food might be good but the people working there are incompetent. Not really sure how hard it is to put someone's name down on the list after waiting 30+ mins, a party of 11 came in and sat before us. Not coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Long wait but it is worth it, 

I went here on my bday with my family, All 5 of us ordered something different and everything was delicious. My personal favorite are the red velvet pancakes and fried adobo rice. 

and there is  a cute boy that works there.
another reason why it's my favorite breakfast place :)"}
{"text":"The food at Babystacks is amazing! I hear their wait is long, but we go around 12 and it isn't so bad. Their breakfast burrito is delicious and just the perfect size and let's not forget about their pancakes. The red velvet and carrot cake pancakes are so yum and the cream cheese syrup makes them even better! My only complaint is that they bring everyone's food out at different times. They really should bring it out all at once, so that everyone's food is hot and can be eaten at the same time."}
{"text":"If they tell you it's an hour wait....stay don't leave. It's well worth it.

You're not a red velvet or pancake eater.....order it. You'll be hearing how great it is from everyone else.

Rick's chicken adobo omelet....  it's the Vegas morning after \"I had one too many shots\" meal.

So, you have to actually get in a car to get to here, and no, it's not on the strip....serious. Don't leave Vegas without coming here. And if you live within an hour of driving distance from here and haven't yet.... get 'er booty on over there! You are missin' out on some really good grub!"}
{"text":"Me, my husband, and my father showed up here on Christmas Eve for some delicious pancakes. We wanted to take my dad out to breakfast, but since we're not from Vegas and he's only lived in Summerlin for a couple years, we turned to Yelp for help. And of course it did no disappoint. 

We started at the original location, but the line was crazy long so we drove down the street to this location. There was still a wait, but we offered to sit at the counter so we were seated immediately. And our service was great, BTW. Sometimes the counter gets forgotten, but we never were.

I ordered the bacon and avocado skillet with a side of red velvet pancakes. My husband ordered the carnitas skillets with a side of lemon ricotta pancakes. And my dad ordered the carrot cake pancakes and a side of potatoes. We were all blown away with how delicious everything was! My skillet was perfect and those red velvet pancakes -- well, you can read all about them in the numerous other reviews. Let me just say, they were everything they were cracked up to be. I think I actually prefer red velvet pancakes to red velvet cake now. That's right, I said it. Oh, and their salsa is all homemade and delicious!

The winner of the morning, however, was the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were more like crepes and they were absolutely PERFECT. So light and fresh. We couldn't stop talking about them, or the restaurant in general. So much so that even a month later while having dinner with some family back home, we mentioned the place and my aunt (who isn't visiting Vegas for months) made me send her all the info for BabyStacks so that she could go eat those pancakes during her visit. 

Well done, BabyStacks. We come back to Vegas at least once a year and I know where one of our stops will always be."}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints about this place, everything was delicious! Our food was great and so was our server. I ordered the pineapple pancake special and my daughter had the carrot cakes, both were moist and full of flavor. My husband ordered the Mexican which we had no complaints about. The only reason I didn't give a perfect 5 stars is because the wait for the food was a little long and not everything came out at the same time but other than that I would recommend this place and I will be returning."}
{"text":"The best pancakes in Vegas the rest ok .
Service was good. The food doesn't have any taste & the coffe taste like tea Lol. so basically the best thing was the banana fosters pancakes!"}
{"text":"Oh breakfast foods, many are the ways that you complete my soul. BabyStacks filled a hole in my breakfast heart that I never knew was there.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious.  The biggest problem I had with the place was there were WAY to many delectable options on the menu.  

I got the hazel nut and my wife got the cream sickle. Both, amazing.  The hazel nut is a Nutella lovers dreams.  The cream sickle was like....well...a cream sickle. We left filling full and wanting to take a nap.  In fact we didn't even have lunch!  That's how much it filled my breakfast hole."}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast/brunch place! Everything, and yes everything here, is delicious. But just to name a few faves: 
- Adobo Fried Rice (try it with added grilled Spam too!!)
- Chili Moco
- Loco Moco
- Mexican Skillet

And ALWAYS do the right thing and get some tasty BabyStacks...I love the Banana Foster, Carrot Cake, and the Cinnabun. But if you have the option of the Dulce de Leche on special that day. do it!"}
{"text":"I was really looking. Forward to trying this place after reading the great reviews on Yelp. The hostess could have made some eye contact, but was prompt to take down my name. The wait wasn't too long and the servers were excellent and very polite. The menu has a very large selection so it took us a bit to order. We finally decided to try the skillets and pancakes. our table was very wobbly and as I uncrossed my legs I bumped the table and coffee went everywhere (great morning so far). my cup had a smear of lipstick on it and when I mentioned it to a waitress she told me it was okay (as if I had made a mistake) and asked another waiter for a \"fresh cup\". I'm really hoping she just didn't hear me. That waiter got me a fresh cup and put some sugar packets under the leg of the table to even it out. I finally get to try my coffee and it's very bland. As I set my cup down I notice some pink stuff on the side and I scraped it off with my nail- it was crusted on- great just great. So, no coffee for me. If you've ever been to an Ihop this is no different. Maybe they were having a bad day. Oh and my husband mentioned the women's bathroom was out of order so everyone had to use the men's and he said it pretty messy. Needless to say we will not return:("}
{"text":"We went here because we had been hearing about it from friends as being amazing. First off, the wait is going to be extremely long as seating is limited here. If you can withstand the wait, you will get seated very closely with other customers. We like our privacy when eating, not listening to our neighbors conversations. 

Then I wasn't very hungry, so I saw the kids meals were available. It never stated anywhere on the menu that you are not able to get a kids meal over a certain age or anything. So I thought, what a great idea to get the perfect amount of food since I wasn't that hungry. Well, the waitress was very rude and would not allow it, despite me even showing her there is nothing showing an age limit. I settled on just a drink and small side item. 

The food is good and prices are alright. Service once seated took a little while as well. I will not be returning, to this location at least. It really struck me badly when the waitress would not allow me to order what was on the menu. If you don't want me to order kids meals, put something on the menu stating that only under 12 or something."}
{"text":"It was a Monday at work.  I felt lonely at lunch.  I wanted to eat to give myself a false sense of happiness.  Good idea, right???

I fear change, so I got an omelet.  With egg whites and no cheese.  I wanted to be healthy.  It was still good.  Part of me wanted to get the adobo chicken or loco moco.  But I didn't, and got an omelet.  Egg whites, spinach, bacon, and mushrooms.  Solid breakfast here.  Instead of the normal side of pancakes, I got the red velvet pancakes to make up for my healthiness.  Wow, these were good.  I bet people who love sweet foods over savory would thoroughly enjoy this.

I would come here to check it out, but the long lines I'm not so sure about."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying how thrilled I am that there is another excellent place in Henderson to have breakfast.

I was most impressed with the extensive and creative menu.  I enjoyed a pork Benedict, while my girlfriend had a very nice omelet.  I'm already looking forward to our next visit and trying out perhaps some of their other Hawaiian oriented things...maybe a little Spam and Eggs ;-)

The service was excellent, the place was clean and prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place for it's pancakes!red velvet pancake are my favorite of all !but banana fosters is not far behind. If you don't mind waiting for a awesome breakfast then this place will hit the spot. My oldest daughter always orders the rocky road pancakes, she says that's what chocolate lovers will like mom!!!! Lol"}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the price is right! My favorites are the red velvet pancake and the carrot cake pancakes! Yumm!"}
{"text":"The service is good and the portions are generous. I like the variety of pancakes you can order. It's a small place that is usually busy so it's best to get there early."}
{"text":"Went here around 8 am on a Thursday morning. It was pretty empty, but when we were leaving, we noticed that it had close to no tables left, so it gets busy! Garlic fried rice is a must. The red velvet pancakes were sweet but really delicious. Service was good as well. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"My biscuits and gravy were.... alright. Pretty bland. Then again I DID order biscuits and gravy from a place called baby stacks... My wife got the Cinnamon roll pancakes and they were absolutely fantastic. Price was great. 20 bucks for my wife and I. no cell phone service in the building :( Seating is first come first served, I am ok with that, but plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch and was not dissapointed. The n buffalo location had an hour wait so we drove to the flamingo location. Upon arrival wait time was 15-20 mins. Well worth the wait. Pancakes were fluffy and packed with just the right amount of flavor. I also had the adobo fried rice omelet. It was ok. Seemed to be lacking something. A little salt and pepper did the trick temporarily. No complaints otherwise. Would definitely come back. Remember hours of operation are from 7-3."}
{"text":"One of our favorite family brunch spot. We always upgrade the pancakes our meals come with to the Red Velvet. Sooo good. We order things from Adobo fried rice omelette to Portuguese sausage with garlic rice."}
{"text":"Since I usually work nights I don't get to go to breakfast/Lunch places very often but this is definitely a favorite when I can. They have the most amazing specialty pancakes EVER!! From banana cream pie to Oreo cookie your sweet tooth is sure to be fulfilled here. You can even get a short stack of them when you order one of their yummy egg skillets. This time tho I had to try their special which was island French toast and omg was my tummy happy. Coconut crusted French toast with macadamia nuts, a sweet cream drizzled on top with a guava passion fruit syrup. I never knew heaven came in the form of breakfast food but at baby stacks it sure does! Saturday and Sunday they are so slammed and a bit of a wait (but sooooo worth it) but this time I went on a wed and it was perfect.."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try, since my wife and missed eating food items we got regularly in Hawaii.

The place was small and it was packed.  We waited about 1/2 before being seated and another 15 minutes before we got our food.  I was surprised that with the many Hawaii related food items that the decor had no tie-in to Hawaii.

Our waitress was friendly and was quick to take our order.  She was so quick that we got our food before the couple that came in before us got there's.  (They had a different waiter)  I was disappointed that she offered us another beverage after our meal was done and we were about to leave.

My wife had the portuguese sausage and eggs with hash brown, and I got the Zippy's chili omelet with hash brown.  I got my food exactly what I ordered, but wished I got more chili.  My wife got the garlic rice instead of hash brown (which she didn't like and we felt it wasn't worth upgrading).  The mistake wasn't the waitress's fault, but with the kitchen because we didn't get charged extra for.

Overall, the food and service was okay, but factoring in the wait time, the mistake with my wife's food and the constant staring from the couple.  I would rather go to the breakfast place up the street on Flamingo."}
{"text":"It was delicious. I will be back! Had the Portuguese sausage and garlic rice. Also had the cookie butter french toast. Service was great and wait wasn't too long even during the busy time."}
{"text":"Yay for BabyStacks! What a great place... Figured out from the menu and music and after asking the server, that owners are from or have ties back to Hawaii. You could see it written all over the menu - rice, portuguese sausage, spam, kalua pig -- I even saw adobo fried rice!

But what they specialize in here are their pancakes. Not a huge pancake fan (I don't mind them as sides but not as a full meal), I wasn't sure what to do. I ended up with one of their skillets. It is potatoes on the bottom with you eggs and whatever else you chose on top. It's not technically in a skillet though. Each skillet (and most other main entrees) come with a short stack of pancakes. You can upgrade to any of their \"fancy\" pancakes too (they must have over 20 types!). Being near the holidays they had chocolate peppermint pancakes so I went with that (one of my fav flavor combos). 

The skillet was good but the pancakes even better. Ok, they almost tasted like cupcakes so maybe that's why they were so yum!

I hear the lines can get long so go during an off hour or expect to wait. Ample parking in the parking lot in front (free).

I wish they would bring Baby Stacks to Hawaii!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, fantastic service, friendly staff. I was slightly disappointed with the buttermilk pancake flavor but a lot of other great things about his place made up for it."}
{"text":"it's like desert for breakfast. which is both awesome and slightly guilt provoking. amazing food. the pb nutella crapes are my favorite! this place is small and gets pretty busy, so unfortuantely we've had to go else where on days the wait was a bit too long. but we always go back :) great staff and fast service."}
{"text":"I love Babystacks, other than the long wait we usually encounter.  But it is worth it, the food is fresh and delicious.  I had scrambled eggs with spinach and a little bit of cheese which was really tasty.  My husband ordered an omelette which he said was very good too."}
{"text":"Always worth the wait for Red Velvet  Pancakes and Ricks Adobo Fried Rice! Our service varies depending on the server. Thank you Ariana for getting our food on point!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes are the bomb, fluffy soft, not too sweet.  They made eggs well with crispy edges.  Large portions.  Unfortunately,  no specialty coffees.  Kinda out of the way to travel and neighborhood a little iffy. Food delicious,  very Hawaiian with spam options."}
{"text":"Hardly any wait this morning, popped in before 9:30 for breakfast. If you come before 10 there is usually no wait.

We ordered the Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which came with Red velvet short stack pancakes with fresh whip cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. We were able to substitute egg whites only on the omelet for an additional $1.25. We also tried the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut short stack. The short stack comes with some Macadamia crumbs on the side, topped with extra white chocolate chips and warm maple syrup. 

The pancakes were very fluffy and filling. The Adobo fried rice was delicious! Shredded chicken with rice wrapped in an egg omelet. Sure there was a hint of soy sauce in this omelet. Delicious goodness that seem to disappear before our eyes 8-D

Will be back again to try some of the other short stack flavors."}
{"text":"I ordered a skillet. Not very flavorful. Bland. It reminded me of cafeteria food at college or a buffet line at an employee dining room at one of the casinos. I have no idea why people love the food here. But then again, I'm writing this review from 1 experience. I don't eat junk like pancakes so I won't ever know how good they are here. If you want a good skillet, go to Stacks n Yolks."}
{"text":"Read about this place on yelp (of course) and we were in the area, so we gave it a try.  

The restaurant is shockingly small.  Be prepared to get up close and personal with your neighbors table. It's no wonder they have a reportedly long wait for tables, but we got in fairly quickly since we went more towards lunch time.  The husband asked for coffee while we waited, and the hostess was very accommodating. 

I was pleasantly surprised to see Hawaiian foods featured on the menu.  This place has a large selection of pancakes, but also has sandwiches and salads and such if pancakes aren't your thing.  The husband got the portugese sausage with the garlic fried rice option and I got an omlet with a side of the famous red velvet pancakes.  

The pancakes were as reported: awesome.  The omlet was just ok, as were the potatoes I got with them.  The sausage was ok too, but it would be pretty hard to screw up sausage.  The real disappointment for the both of us was the garlic fried rice.  Sounded so good in theory, but did not deliver.  There was too much garlic in it, and I love garlic.  Also, the rice was Uncle Bens.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to cater to Hawaiian transplants, you gotta come correct with the rice.  It has to be sticky calrose rice, not hard, dry Uncle Bens!  

Overall, this place was decent.  If youre into pancakes, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Honey wheat pancakes- on point. Egg and bacon breakfast with potatoes and toast- prime time. Service- magnific. 10/10 for this place."}
{"text":"Finally, a BABYSTACKS IN HENDERSON!!! I disliked the fact that I had to drive all the way to Buffalo for this deliciousness. Now, I am lucky enough to have them close to work and home! 
This pancake house is semi Hawaiian themed with things like Adobo Omlettes, garlic rice, and mac salad. All 3, great choices! There are also over a dozen pancake selections like red velvet, lemon ricotta, and bacon. I usually go with the seasonal specials such as strawberry lemonade, and bananas foster. 
Never once have I been disappointed. Well, except for the wait time. Unless you go right when they open, or an hour before closing, expect to wait. None of the 3 locations are very big. I think they are going for that personal feel. 
The service is pretty good. Not over the top amazing, but quick, decent, and friendly. 
If you haven't tried Babystacks, it's worth a wait. Maybe not an hour wait, but this place is popular for a reason."}
{"text":"WHO: For the Breakfast and Lunch of Champions!!

WHERE: Located in the small plaza on South Buffalo and Flamingo.

WHEN: During the weekdays, they are open from 7am-2pm. On the weekends, they are open from 7am-3pm.

WHAT: I cannot believe I have not yet written a review for my ultimate favorite breakfast spot ever!!!

Whenever I am not at work, or wake up early enough to eat breakfast, this is the first place on my mind! I am so glad they are opening up several new locations (this is the 2nd location) because the lines were out the door!!

As everyone recommends, the Red Velvet pancakes are always a hit! Personally, my favorite pancake is the Banana Cream Pie pancakes!! There are so many to choose from, and I bet they are all great. Hmm. I just thought of a new goal.. TRY ALL THE PANCAKES ON THE MENU!

Along with the dessert, the food is undoubtedly WONDERFUL! From the Adobo Omelet, Kahlua Pork Benedict, Kahlua Pork Grilled Cheese, to the Portuguese Sausage and Egg, you cannot go wrong with anything you decide to get. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOSO!!!

So take the time off and bring your family here for an amazing Breakfast/Brunch! Not only will the adults love it, the kids will have a blast from all the stacks of pancakes you will be getting, since you will probably all be TRYING ALL OF THE PANCAKES ON THE MENU! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is dangerous! It's a good thing that they are not open during the evenings, because I might double up and have breakfast and dinner all in the same day. Being from Hawaii, I appreciate their 'Hawaiian style' and breakfast fusion. Their creations are delectable and filling. Flavors are amazing combinations, textures have been perfect on every visit. Thank you for bringing a little piece of breakfast into Henderson!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and definitely a local place aware from the strip. We arrived with 12 people and we didn't have to wait long for a table on a Saturday afternoon.  Our server was fast and all out orders were quickly made and delivered.  Overall it was a great experience, and I will be back next time I am in LV."}
{"text":"You will most likely see a line when you arrive, but it moves fast and this place is worth the wait. There's nothing like a good breakfast and that's exactly what you're going to get here. Wish I had a picture to show, but I gobbled it up too fast."}
{"text":"we meet again, red velvet pancakes!

more open space and seats available; less crowded than the other location. friendly staff and new specials on the menu. ordered the spam scramble - scrambled eggs with diced spam sprinkled with sesame and seaweed seasoning, served with rice and macaroni salad. i love breakfast and although it might be simple, it's very comforting. i'm use to eating spam, eggs, and rice as a kid. also ordered red velvet pancakes on the side and it comes with cream cheese syrup. yes, i said it - cream cheese syrup! will definitely come back again and try other things on the menu (especially the other types of pancakes)! check out the picture i posted."}
{"text":"Seriously best red velvet pancakes I've ever had in my life!!! Also, the pricing was just phenomenal! 4 adults and 4 kids ate breakfast for under 60 dollars!!! Pancakes, eggs, hash browns, orange juice, coffee, 2 kids meals & in sure I'm forgetting something! The waitress was so happy and friendly! We really enjoyed it here and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pancakes and omelet. Absolutely nothing to complain about! Makes me want to take another trip to Vegas just to return."}
{"text":"It was during our annual Thanksgiving trip to Vegas that we came across this cafe. My boyfriend and I needed to fuel up before we head out to the outlet for some serious shopping. We wanted pancakes so I did a quick Google search under \"Best brunch in Vegas\" and this came up as one of the 10. I have the tendency to look up menus to see if anything jumps out at me before I actually head there...the red velvet pancakes got me.

This cafe ended up being a little further than I expected off the strip...but wasn't hard to find. 

To our surprise, we walked into a Filipino owned restaurant! It's as if the motherboard was calling my boyfriend home! :p As we got to our seat, I kept seeing patrons munching on a breakfast burrito and I couldn't find it on the menu at all! Whenever there's a breakfast burrito on the menu, I had to get it. So being too shy to ask, I ended up ordering Baby Chick Omelette with a side upgrade of the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend didn't go far from his homeland and ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice with a short stack of the Rocky Road pancakes. 

The service was casual and quick. We got our food not too long after and as soon as it came, we dove in...after taking pictures of our food, OF COURSE! My Baby Chick Omelette was good and definitely loaded! The red velvet pancakes were good but I think Larchmont Bungalow in LA makes it better. I had a bite of the Adobo Fried Rice. It was good but a little dry for my taste. My boyfriend loved it though. His Rocky Road pancakes were to die for!!! It's ice cream in carbs form. Yum!!

I think this establishment is a great change from your strip buffets and overpriced food. I would definitely come here again. 

As we went to the front to pay, I noticed behind their cashier was a blackboard of....their specials. And guess what was on their...the burrito. :( Lesson learned...ALWAYS CHECK OUT THE BLACKBOARD FOR SPECIALS!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.

My favorite  meal is the Hungington Omelette and the Red Velvet pancakes (of course).  I swear they get their eggs from some super secret chicken farm in Narnia or something because their omelettes and skillets and spam and eggs are delicious.
By the way, LOVE that they serve spam and eggs.  Brings me back home so it's really nice.  And their seasoned potatoes are out of this world.
I don't really feel like I need to say anything about the red velvet pancakes, just walk in and look at all the articles on the wall.

The staff is great.  It helps that I discovered a long lost friend works there.  They're really prompt and friendly and I enjoy very much eating there. 

I could have brunch there every single day.  I may suit up for it next time."}
{"text":"After hearing about their infamous red velvet pancakes, and taking advantage of their Groupon offer, we decided to give this place a try.

First of all, this place is small - we're talking seating for less than 50 people, give or take a few. I had read that there was usually a wait due to the popularity of the place and the lack of seating, but luckily for us, we were seated immediately when we arrived at 9:30 on a Tuesday morning. 

We ordered: 

Country fried steak: I almost always order country fried steak when it's on a menu, and this one was one of the better ones I've had in Vegas. It was really tender, and the outside was nicely seasoned. I also loved the fact that it came with country gravy with breakfast sausage in it - it was yummy and tasted like it was homemade.

Eggs: My eggs were over-easy, and they were cooked perfectly; no runny whites, only runny yolks, just how I like them. Hubby had scrambled eggs, and they were nice and fluffy.

Potatoes: I had the hash browns and Hubby had the seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were crispy and didn't require any salt, but were pretty average.

Sourdough toast: I don't know how many times I've ordered sourdough toast only to be disappointed. That wasn't the case this time - this is the real deal - not that imitation white bread posing as sourdough.

Corned beef hash: This was the canned version, which was disappointing. If there's one thing on a breakfast menu that most people expect to be homemade, it's corned beef hash. 

Red velvet pancakes: Hubby was nice enough to offer me one bite, and boy, was it delicious! It's the perfect balance of the red velvet flavor in a fluffy pancake. It came with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and... wait for it... cream cheese syrup! I wanted another bite, but Hubby gave me that \"I love you, but don't even think about touching my pancakes or I will seriously stab you with my fork\" look. Yeah, I think he liked the pancakes. ;)

Service was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for local eateries to try, we headed over to Babycakes on a Sunday because we saw the high ratings and wanted to see for ourselves what the hoopla was all about.

First off, there was a 30 min wait to be seated but despite this, we decided to wait it out so we can have a taste of Babycakes dining. The inside looked pretty cozy but nothing spectacular.

Once seated, we ordered coffee and was served some along with nasty looking cream. By nasty, I mean there were brown stuff crusted on the half and halfs. 

I decided to order Rick's Adobo Fried Rice since I like adobo and I like fried rice and was curious what it tasted like as an omelette dish. The others I were with ordered banana pancakes and the piglet omelette. 

The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time but sadly, they were a disappointment. Maybe because of all the hype, I really wanted to like Babycakes. But the food was pretty bland and a bit overpriced comparable to other breakfast joints like iHop or Blueberry Hill, both which are much better food-wise and price-wise.

Don't think will be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Waitress was great but food was made with little care an sloppy. As if the cook was lazy and just wanted to get the orders out quickly since it was busy. Not sure what all the hype is about, you can make any item on the menu at home and probably better."}
{"text":"Bad day here , not really crowded came in got seated and waited,waited and waited for 15 min went and talked to guy at register who was clueless, may have to think about service issues here"}
{"text":"1st time going.. Wait time was a little bit longer than the usual breakfast places.. Server took a while to come take the order, bring the check ect.... Food was good not impressed with the pancakes though."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive from henderson! Red velvet pancakes a MUST! I got a short stack and it was plenty! Take the trip there! I promise you wont be dusappointed"}
{"text":"This place has really yummy food!! I loove the bananas fosters pancake. Soo good! Adobo fried rice and loco moco hit the spot as well. The cashier can be a little temperamental but our server Valerie [I think] was very friendly."}
{"text":"First time here! A little small.. The wait was not too bad! Loved the crepes! Can't wait til next weekend to have some more!"}
{"text":"The adobo omelette had no flavor. It didn't taste like adobo. The kid says the kiddie chicken fingers and fries were good. My BYO build your own omelette (Spinach, mushroom, tomato and peppers) was alright. The red velvet pancake upgrade with a mountain of whip cream (passed off to the kid) was good but what I thought was a cream cheese sauce was a bit sweet and didn't taste like cream cheese. Maybe it was white chocolate. Either way, I don't think we would return."}
{"text":"Do you want to know the worst thing about Baby Stacks? That the owner thought people only live off Buffalo, because the only locations that I know of, are Southwest, and Northwest. 
I bet you were thinking I was going to say the wait huh? Because if you don't know, now you know, YOU WILL WAIT! However, I don't really mind the wait. If you come super early, or late you might get lucky and be seated right away.  I have not had that experience. My wait times have been 45 min on a Sunday, and 20 min on a Wednesday. Worth it? INDEED!
Baby Stacks is known for 2 things in my opinion. 1. Their variety of pancake selections. Red Velvet, Rocky Road, Nutella, and my personal fav Lemon Ricotta. There is a hotcake to please everyone. 2. Their Hawaiian options like Loco Moco, spam, and garlic rice. 
I would eat here way more if they opened up a Henderson location. Although I have never ventured outside of the breakfast, I wouldn't hesitate to do so. I am always satisfied with service, the food, and the ambiance in general. Solid, local business, with extraordinary  pancakes."}
{"text":"I had the chocolate chip pancakes and corned beef hash and my wife had the bacon pancakes and sausage links and eggs. I think everything was incredible. My wife also loved almost everything. Except that the potatoes were a little over seasoned. All and all We will def be going back soon. Thank you for the great service and excellent experience. Fyi don't be shyed away by long lines. They move fast."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for a table for four. I kinda dig the \"small town homey\" vibe I got. Everyone who was working there was pleasant. It was a Sunday morning so we expected a slight wait. 

We were shown our table and our server was right over. She was very nice. I forgot her name by she's the redhead who was super nice and friendly. Took our drink orders and promptly had them. Kids at Sprite and we had coffee. We both enjoyed the coffee. 

We looked at the menu, decided on what we wanted and ordered. 

10 or so minutes the food was served. My only complaint was that my wife's food came out a solid 10 minutes after mine and our kids. She was a trooper and told us to eat and not to worry because she would pick over our food. 

I ordered the cowboy skillet. Plenty of food as it came with pancakes (or toast). The skillet was very good and the eggs were perfectly cooked (over easy.) the pancakes were delicious and perfectly cooked. 

My daughter had a kids sized egg (scrambled), bacon and two sausage patties and has towns. The hash browns were just a tad oily but still very good. The sausage was amazing. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

My son had the chicken tenders and fries. No complaints there. He ate it all up. 

My wife's food finally came. She got the cowboy omelette. She said it was excellent and was only able to make it through half before she couldn't go any further. 

All in all a great little place. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Service (several days ago) started out so unfriendly that I felt as if my presence was a bother to our waitress.  She rounded our table so quickly when taking our order, I felt as if I was at an auction of some sort.  I asked her what the WiFi password was and she told me \"I don't know, go ask the people at the front\"??!  Okaaaay, let me just do your job for you.  So, after standing in line for some time, I asked for the password which isn't a secret and is literally posted on the cashier stand for everyone to see.  On top of that, it is the easiest word to remember - breakfast.  AND, the cashier was kinda unfriendly too!!  Really dude?  Ever heard the phrase, treat others the way you want to be treated?  I appreciate friendliness just like you probably do. 

However, something must have happened after that.  Maybe the manager could see I was ticked because different staff started helping us, and I didn't see the original waitress until we were about finished.  At that time, she seemed to have gotten the stick out.  

Food is pretty darn tasty though, so that's a plus... So, just appreciate the good service if/when you get it.  There are at least 2 good employees vs the 2 bad employees that we had the pleasure/displeasure of dealing with that day."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here, very popular then and very popular still. Which was the reason I wanted to come here in the first place. My routine when first trying a restaurant for the first time is, reading the reviews and then looking at the pictures, keeping in mind the most popular dishes. Yes, I do judge a book by its cover...  

First time, I tried the adobo fried rice omelette. I couldn't even finish it, it was too salty for my liking. With 6 people in our household, someone's gotta finish it somehow right? Wrong.... Could it be that we're Filipinos and we were spoiled by our grandmother's adobo? Maybe...

Second visit, it's the closest brunch place from my son's high school. I still had it bookmarked since I believe in second chances. So I'm on yelp and decided on what I was going to order before I start picking up my boys from school. 

Red Velvet Full Stack- It's good! It's fluffy and it's true that it's breakfast and dessert at the same time. I, don't have a sweet tooth and if I like something that is anything desserty then you know it's not too sweet. The hubby tried it and so did the boys but by then end of the day, I was the one that finished these pancakes. I hate myself and so do my pants! 

Country Fried Steak & Eggs- Back to me, I'm not a morning person but I do LOVE breakfast. And I LOVE country fried steak. If you take me anywhere for breakfast, you can bet I'm gonna order country fried steak. Ask my husband, my boys, friends, ask anyone. I will not be coming here for my country fried steak. The gravy wasn't as tasty and they didn't pound the meat enough,IMO. 

Cora's Corned Beef Hash- My family and I love corned beef, they finished this. I didn't get to taste it due to how fast it vanished but by the looks of it, I don't feel like I missed anything. 

Portuguese Sausage- I remember when I was younger, after a night out with my girlfriends, we'd go to El Dorado in Reno and order Portuguese sausage... I'd bring my family there for the Portuguese sausage. We didn't finish this either. I also opted for the garlic fried rice and wow the onions were humongous! NO!!!!! Just no. 

Lastly, the regular buttermilk pancakes the boys did enjoy. I was too busy eating the red velvet pancakes I didn't get the chance to try this. 

I spoke to my co-worker about my second visit at Babystacks and I'm not the only one that didn't enjoy the food there. She was also not impressed. So, I'm not the only one."}
{"text":"Another hidden treasure in Henderson. The loco plate with the red velvet pancakes is a great combo!!"}
{"text":"The Red Velvet pancakes was good Not Great like everyone Hype it up to be. Don't like that they close so early. Not everyone can get up so early in the day. People work all different hours in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, probably not the healthiest but their pancakes are the best I have ever had. i also like the mexican omelet a lot! Great place with great service."}
{"text":"YUMMM!! Being from out of state I am so sad that I can not eat here on a regular basis and try everything on the menu.  

We went on a Sunday morning and were met by a crowd and an hour wait to be seated with 6 people.  It was however totally worth the wait.  Being from out of state and not having a chance to try everything we ended up sharing bites of our food choices around the table.  Everything was delicious.  Lots of fun flavors like red velvet and orange creamsicle.  I also got to taste the crepes which were just the right about of thin and tender with yummy fresh fruit in them.  I ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which is an egg omelet of sorts with salty meaty fried rice wrapped up in it like a burrito.  It was the perfect amount of savory to go with all of the sweet pancakes."}
{"text":"To summarize our experience - LONG WAIT & overrated. 

The pancakes were definitely delicious.  The omelet was average.  Your typical American brunch place with some Mexican & Filipino influence.  We'll probably go back for that \"specialty\"... but I don't see us frequenting there."}
{"text":"Babystacks' pancakes are unbeatable. Their selection of flavors will keep you interested and never bored. If I could eat here for breakfast every day, I will be one happy camper. 

In addition to their huge selection of breakfast items, they also serve lunch and other entrees. My favorite is the spam and eggs served with garlic rice. It's simple to make, but let's be honest, I don't cook often. I would highly recommend this dish if you're looking for something not too heavy. It also comes with a side of shortstack pancakes of your choice! 

The prices aren't cheap here, but the portions are generous. Ample parking outside. And the service has been wonderful every time I've dined here."}
{"text":"First time here & I guess we should have had breakfast. Maybe breakfast is better but their lunch menu is sub par. Chicken avocado sandwich came much later than the test of the food, the bun was stale, chicken was hard & dried out & avocado looked like it had been scooped a while ago. We sent it back & they took it off the bill. Club sandwich was just OK. So a 1 and a 3 average to a 2. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really good breakfast. There are many varieties of pancakes you can choose from that other places won't have. There seasoned potatoes are the best potatoes I've ever had. It's pretty packed at times but I haven't had to wait longer than 5 minutes to be seated and there service is great from always checking up to see if you need a refill to there positive attitudes! Your food only takes between 15-30 minutes to be served which is great when your super hungry! If your ever in Las Vegas you should go and try there amazing food!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious with a wide variety of pancakes as well as tons of different kinds of omelettes! AND it was pretty reasonably priced. 

They are located in kind of an awkward place that you would have to drive by a lot to know it was there, so spread the word!!

Also, just has the leftovers from my Red Velvet pancakes and they were almost even better the second time!!"}
{"text":"If your in the Las Vegas area this is a must. Breakfast was amazing no complaints and customer service was great as well.  food was very tasty . You have to try the blueberry pancakes and I also upgraded my rice to garlic rice . Will definitely be back here when I come back to visit"}
{"text":"First time here, and the first place we went to eat breakfast as soon as we got into town.

Hands down the best pancakes I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Watch out I hop here comes babystacks!! I rarely go out for breakfast but when I do , it better be good. Baby stacks was just that, great pancakes fair prices and huge portions. Had the banana pancakes full stack which were amazing. Syrup is sweet but not too sweet. The full stack was gigantic and was enough to tide me over for the whole day. The place gets VERY crowded on the weekend but it's great food so that's to be expected. All the staff was very friendly and provided prompt service. WILL GLADLY GO BACK for their red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Awful take out experience. Formerly my regular take out spot, but I'm never going back again.  Sent him to pickup for me since I had the flu, and they even didn't have an order - my food ticket was \"missing\"? 

They eventually found it, and it took much longer since there was a big order ahead of me now (no longer the 10-15 min wait time, and he even arrived in 25 mins since it's consistently never ready when promised!) 

Also, if you use a cc - expect them to ask for your tip at ring out on take out orders... it's really awkward, and horribly worse when you get home and it's the wrong order! 

By the time he got home (now 1 hr later), I found out it one of the two orders had the wrong meat...If you call in a takeout order, have them repeat it back to you & check it at the counter...because when I called them, they argued with me that I ordered it wrong. I have never in my life eaten turkey sausage (which apparently are scary dry patties). 

After I said there's literally no way I ordered something I've never heard of, they did replace it, but I drove to get it since he was already really pissed off from the first pick up delay and the nerve of them to ask for a tip when they lost the ticket and he got stuck waiting around 30+ mins.  

I wouldn't have even written this if they lost the ticket but we're sorry about it and made some sort of effort to try to get it out asap...but the expected tip and the wrong food is just too much to ignore."}
{"text":"We've been here before but decided not to come back again ever since my husband called in to order food to take home. When he went to pick up the food, the person at the register asked him how he would like to leave his tip, as in, \"Will you be leaving a tip?\" My husband was caught off guard and did not expect to feel pressured to leave a tip for ordering pancakes and picking them up to go. This is extremely tacky and rude of any business. We will never be coming back or taking family here again. We truly hope their staff learns proper etiquette."}
{"text":"OMG! Those red velvet pancakes were AMAZING! I have to say that I would probably skip the Kalua Pig Benedict next time and either go for just the pancakes or maybe a skillet. Overall, this place rocks! I will be back here the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The wait was supposed to be 20 minutes but we only had to wait about 10! It was very busy but everything comes out pretty fast. The tables are a bit small but for two people it's manageable for how yummy the food is. 
They played reggae through out my breakfast which just so happens to be my favorite genre. I think this is my new favorite place!

The server was very sweet and helped us make our choices. 

I got the bacon and eggs and they were delicious. My mom got the corned beef hash which she thought was a bit dry. She also ordered the sweet créme crepes with banana and they were PHENOMENAL! The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I recommend trying the crepes the next time you come here!!! Definitely check it out :)"}
{"text":"Best corned beef hash and lemon ricotta pancakes in town. Service was amazing as always. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast spot, but I've tasted better. 4 stars.

So I thought I've never been here before, but once I entered the restaurant, I was like ok I actually remember coming here before. I came with my family and they all said the same thing. At that time though, I was more of a savory breakfast type than a sweet breakfast type. 

When I first saw the menu, I had a really really hard time choosing. Ive never seen such a large variety of pancakes to choose from. I wanted to get the Cookie Butter French Toast because I LOVE Nutella and cookie butter, but I also really craved Banana Cream Pie Pancakes because I LOVE banana cream pie. So, I just couldn't help it and got both. My mom ordered from the Specials Menu, she got the Toffee Lemon Caramel Pancakes (TLC). 

We got short stacks for all the pancakes, which prices vary by type of pancake, but in this instance the banana cream pie pancakes were $5.75, the French toast was $9.50.

The Cookie Butter French Toast was really really good. It had a slight crunch and not overly sweet, just perfect. They used crunchy cookie butter which was just delicious. I would totally get it again.

So for the pancakes, I was expecting banana cream pie pancakes, but it tasted too artificial and nothing like banana cream pie. I was pretty disappointed in that and for the TLC pancakes, they were an even bigger disappointment. They were barely sweet at all, so we asked for some maple syrup. 

I would give this place 3 stars if it wasn't for the French toast. It was love at first bite, I instantly fell in love with it. So that boot the 3 to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! Beware of long weekend brunch wait. There is usually at least a 45 min wait on Saturday and Sunday at this location! The one further south has a shorter wait as they have a bigger dining space. Overall food is just a bit above average good but their pancakes are the bomb! There are so many options and we have yet to go through the entire selection. Red velvet, rocky road, white chocolate macadamia are among some of our classic favs. They also have special pancakes of the month that tend to be either a hit or miss. The German something something special was bomb but the most recent red white and blue in honor of the 4th is meh. But overall great location for a taste of island style brunch!"}
{"text":"Babystack's original location was one of my favorite breakfast spots back in the day.  I'm happy that they have branched out and there are multiple locations including this one close to me.  For breakfast I usually get an Omelette or Eggs Benedict.  Hubby's go-to's are Loco Moco or Country Fried Steak.  The pancakes are my favorite and even when we come for lunch I have to get a short stack on the side.  While I love the OG Red Velvet, I usually go for one of their special stacks.  Service is friendly and prices are super affordable.  Always check the board in the front.  You never know what specials they might have."}
{"text":"Prices are good but you basically get what you pay for. 
Food isnt that good, they don't serve you much. People are nice, they only have one bathroom for each gender."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot! Delicious pancakes and amazing skillet meals. Great for families and kids."}
{"text":"Even if you are not a pancake person you will love babystacks.  It's like having dessert for breakfast.   :-)  we always get cookies and cream,  red velvet,  or banana foster pancakes.  In all my travels this is the best breakfast I've ever had.  If I ever leave Vegas I wish I could take this cafe with me!"}
{"text":"During my recent trip to Vegas, I decided to try Babycakes Cafe and it was definitely good.  I had the ham (delicious complete with grill marks), eggs, and potatoes and upgraded my pancakes to carrot cake.  The pancakes were alright, but the cream cheese syrup is delicious so that made them better.  My friend had the banana pancakes and said they were very good.  I may try it again to try the red velvet pancakes, but it was a little ways from the strip and I've had other breakfasts in Vegas that were better and closer, but overall it was alright."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at babystacks. Service is great and the FOOD is phenomenal! Cheap place lots of substitutions to fit everyone. Hands down smores pancakes are the best!"}
{"text":"Love babystacks make sure you get there early cause they always busy. Food is always good and love there pancakes too. Always jam great music and very friendly too."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast! The food was delicious, just get there at the right time so you don't have to wait long!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing the buzz about BabyStacks forever, and hadn't checked it out because I'm not big on traditional breakfast food for breakfast and very rarely indulge in pancakes etc. 

Today, I was driving around and saw that they are very close to my home in the old Becker's Steakhouse center. It was 1:30 and I walked in, was greeted and led to a table and told my server would be right with me. 

A couple was enjoying huge platters of pancakes and what looked like French Toast nearby. The mood was livened by reggae music playing. 

My trepidation about arriving 30 minutes prior to closing was alleviated straightaway by the cheerful server. She was more than happy to suggest the Turkey & Avocado sandwich when I said I was debating that or salad. I opted for the $1 add on fruit salad in lieu of a side salad whose dressings all sounded heavy to me, and I'm not sure if fries were an option, but I avoid them. 

My sandwich was huge. Hard to get my mouth around huge. Thick slices of toasted wheat bread housed a generous portion of very good turkey, fresh avocado slices and tomatoes, and lots of iceberg. It was so large I took half to go along with half of my fruit salad which contained strawberries, melon, grapes, blueberries and pineapple. I made the oversight of failing to request mustard or to put mayo on the side, so it contained quite a bit of mayo (unnecessary because the turkey was moist and avocado only added to that) 

Chatted with some of the staff who were very sweet, and in no way felt rushed so close to closing time. I'll definitely be back to try some other items and bring my chocolate lover friends in for those red velvet pancakes. Some of the crepes and other pancakes sound promising. 

There was cute and cheery decor and the place was clean and inviting. After reading of long lines, guess I lucked out taking a chance. 

For 11$ + 5& tip because my waitress was just so sweet talking about explaining skype to her grandma in Hawaii, I enjoyed a lovely lunch & dinner later on. 

Glad to have finally discovered this neighborhood gem and look forward to supporting a charming local business."}
{"text":"Meh...  wait was really long, the service seemed disconnected and the food was expensive for what it was.  The bathroom was dirty and so were the floors.  Just a bad experience for me, I will have to give this place a second chance since everyone loves it so much."}
{"text":"Ever since a friend of mine introduced me to BabyStacks, I would come here every time I'm in Vegas.  The food here is really good and the people are nice and friendly.  The Kula pig benedict is delicious.  The pig is moist and tender and the eggs are cooked perfectly.  Their biscuits and gravy are the best I had so far.  Rick's Adobo fried rice is also yummy.  But I do have to say, the red velvet pancakes are to die for!  The fresh whipped cream and the cream cheese syrup with the pancakes is lip smacking good.  I can't wait till the next Vegas trip so that I can get my red velvet pancake fix."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! 

Ordered the Adobo Fried Rice which came with a side of pancakes. SO YUMMY!!!!!!! Also tried the loco moco which was equally great.

Loved everything we tried and will be back again when in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Nothing less then expected, pancakes do not disappoint; go for the red velvet! Thanks will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my fave breakfast spot ever since they opened. I usually just get their full order of Red Velvet Pancakes but when I'm really hungry, I order their delicious Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice and just a side of the pancakes. Mmm! *burp*"}
{"text":"Do not go here when it's busy. They do not handle crowds well. The hostesses are incompetent. The service was good and the food was great. This place is probably terrific on slow to average days."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes and crepes! Spam and eggs was great too. Wonderful service and not too long a wait for a party of 8."}
{"text":"I really love their red velvet pancakes :) it's more of a dessert then a breakfast but it's amazing! 

Aside from the food they have extremely friendly service and are always very helpful.

I have to give them 4 starts because it is Kind of stupid that they won't seat you until your entire party is there. it can be annoying when you have family that are always late and you want to start on coffee."}
{"text":"Mocha chip pancakes were awesome. Hubby had Hawaiian Benedict. It was great. Not to much food, just enough."}
{"text":"Good food but very small and wait is very long. Ate at the bar and we got pretty good service."}
{"text":"Love this place everything is fresh as well as the smiles wait can be a while but it def is worth it"}
{"text":"Ordered take out this morning.  Drove 25 minutes to their location only to arrive and have them tell me that what I ordered over the phone 25 minutes ago is not available.  Why didn't they tell me this over the phone?  Good job Baby Stacks!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I've had is delicious and perfectly cooked. Scrambled eggs are fluffy and flavorful, bacon is thick and perfectly crisp, and gourmet pancakes are amazing. My favorite stack is the red velvet pancakes- topped with freshly made whipped cream and chocolate and served with an icing sauce on the side-so yummy!! The staff is friendly, prices are low, one of my favorite breakfast joints around."}
{"text":"Took the little one a few times to get the French Toast. Great staff and quick food. The french fries are awesome with that seasoning they use."}
{"text":"I love red velvet.  Cake, waffles, vodka...I love it all.  So I finally made it to BabyStacks to try their red velvet pancakes and they didn't disappoint.  They were perfect.  Sometimes when you get red velvet food it doesn't taste like red velvet...Its not just chocolate dyed red people!  These were on point.  We also got the piglet omelet, huntington omelet, smores pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes and the kids scramble.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  We went on a Friday morning and there was no wait.  Service wasn't the greatest.  Our waitress was very nice just not very attentive.  Drinks were never refilled, not once, needed a min to look at the menu didn't come back for over 15 min while others were seated, got drinks and ordered.  Still she didn't come back.  They weren't busy so it was a little surprising.  My tip: don't say you need a minute.  Took quite awhile to get the check.  The busser had cleared our table and we still sat waiting for the check.  Kinda hard when you have little ones who are ready to go.   Overall, the food was worth the service issues.  Looking forward to trying the carrot cake pancakes next time."}
{"text":"This place is a bit Over Rated. My boyfriend and I drove across town to check out this new popular spot but i must say the \"red velvet pancakes\" are not,.. my faves. lets just leave it as that. If you eat that thing with no icing, theres no taste. 

Anyways, on to the positive aspects. The place is nice and homely filled with welcoming services and a great variety of choices (especially for those asian/filipino people and their type of breakfast with rice and spam.. etc).  I ordered a crunchy whole grain french toast and i must say i was very surprised how good it was! it seems very simple, a french toast covered in crunchy corn flakes, but it was so yummy and good looking, the people next to me ordered it too and loved it! My boyfriend got an veggie omlete and the red velvet pancakes as the side so we can both try. Overall this place was good but I wouldn't drive all the way across town to come eat again, sorry!"}
{"text":"My aunt is a local and raaaaves about this place constantly on fb.  So when we came for a trip I knew I had to go. Holy yum!!! I had the breakfast burrito and red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup. They were the best pancakes I've ever had. I'm going back tomorrow before I leave. My God it was amazing!!! Great service and I hear it gets pretty busy and it was a slow Thursday!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are literally heaven on a plate.

I've been to this particular location a few times and I fell in LOVE as soon as the food touched my tongue. The only reason that I'm giving them 4 stars is because of the wait. Every single time I come it's at least a 25-45 minute wait because the location is so small inside. I really hope that the expand because they miss out on so much business with people not wanting to wait.

I LOVE this place. yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"This was a cool spot. Visited my fam who absolutely loves this place. Love the Hawaii vibe to it. Makes us feel like we're back home. 

Let me address the 4-star vs 5-star rating: It wasn't a bad place. I took one star away because some of the dishes were seasoned a little too lightly. Maybe that's their style, which is fine, but it's not my preference. 

Now, on to the food - BEST PANCAKES I'VE HAD. For that, I applaud you guys. I ate their two days in a row - once with my brother and once with my dad. One day I had the Kalua Benedict. It was good, but a little bland. Also ate the Tiramisu baby stack which was BOMB DIGGITY.

The next day I had the breakfast burrito, which was a solid burrito. I also ordered the Hazlenut pancakes. They were a little dry; not the pancakes themselves but the overall dish. Overall it was a good plate (or plates) of food.

THe staff was kind and very attentive. We had them play musical chairs quite a bit with our stroller and high chairs, but they were awesome the whole time. I'd go again, and I'd invite people there."}
{"text":"great pancakes. Get the banana foster pancakes! I decided to get the full stack and it was well worth it. The pancakes are buttery smooth and an acceptable size for a full stack.

However, you may have to wait a bit and this location was quite small.

Worth the wait? Yup.

Should I try it? Yup.

Pancakes? Legitness"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. It's almost always crowded, but they are able to get you in very quickly. So many choices of pancakes, and you can get them as a side with any meal. Their skillet breakfasts are amazing, and the loco moco is excellent. Service is always very good."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot. The red velvet pancakes are amazing and service is always great. Saturday's are typically a little less busy them Sunday's."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to try out. Our party of 4 arrived about 9:30 am, and waited 10-15 minutes for a table. 
We ordered the Spam & Eggs, Adobo Fried Rice & our kids got LJ's Scramble. The food was delicious and the pancake recommendations by Clarise were great! The staff is super friendly, and the service was great. We'll definitely come again if we're ever in the area looking for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place, ohhh man the bananas foster pancakes are amazing, an I'm not a big fan of pancakes, but hot darn the pancakes make me wanna dance. The wait was pretty average,  but worth it."}
{"text":"Cute place. Get here early cuz it gets packed quickly. The menu is alright I guess they are known for their pancakes. I tried the red velvet and it was good. This is a TMI moment so feel free to skip the next few sentences. The aftermath after eating red velvet, you seriously think you are dying. It take a couple days for the red dye to leave your body. 
The rest of the food is ok. It's nothing spectacular but it is nice to have something other than Ihop or dennys. The staff is very friendly but don't come here if you are in a hurry. It takes a bit to order and get your food. 
On a plus if you are military they give a 10% discount."}
{"text":"All of my friends know I'm not a fan of breakfast restaurants. I think they're overpriced and the food they serve is food I can make it home. However, if I was to have a favorite breakfast place it would definitely be this place! 
Service is always friendly and fast. 

My go to order is the loco moco with red velvet pancakes on the side. I've had the Portuguese sausage plate and it's delicious too. 
I'm always tempted to try other pancakes but every single time I go here I only end up ordering the red velvet because I'm afraid I won't like any of the other ones as much and I'll miss out on this delicious creation. 

Writing this review is making me want to go there again so I think I'm going to stop writing this review and head over there right now. You should go!"}
{"text":"My oh my.. I'm not much of a sweets person, but I could eat their famous Red Velvet pancakes for days! I was hesitant to order it because I have a tendency to gravitate towards savory foods, but after reading so many reviews about it, I knew I had to give it a go. As mentioned in other reviews, the pancakes are so soft, fluffy, and just filled with flavor. It comes with some cream and condensed milk in place of regular syrup, but you can ask for addition syrup on the side. 

I also got Rick's adobo fried rice, which came wrapped in an egg! It was pretty good, however the rice was slightly hard and/or old. Other than that, the dish wasn't too salty and was yummy! 

The service was a tad bit slow... when I went to pay, I was second in line and within 5 minutes, there were three parties behind me! Workers were nice, but slightly slow. 

P.S. 
The cashier told me there are five different locations around the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Too many rules. We couldn't sit until everyone arrived in door.  My order took 25 minutes and 4 out of 5 people were served 5 minutes before 5th person"}
{"text":"I have not liked pancakes for over 10 years and could not even stomach the thought of them. But I will absolutely murder Baby Stack's pancakes!! And their chicken adobo omelette is everything!! Their service is just as fabulous as their food too. We absolutely love it here!!!!"}
{"text":"Prepare to not be hungry for the rest of the day! Portions are huge and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Ricks adobo omelet is off the charts! Biscuits and gravy were light as pancakes. We did have to wait about 20 minutes but is was definitely worth the wait. Cinnabon pancakes reminded us of traveling and grabbing a Cinnabon in the airport. The service was a 10 out of 10!! No one walked by the table without checking on us. amazing when they are so busy at sunday Brunch. This will be a new regular spot!"}
{"text":"If you plan on coming here, don't arrive an hour before they close. The servers don't seem to care at all if you're waiting to be greeted, what I would like to drink, and most of all... take my order and get my order right. I waited nearly over 20 mins. to get my drink order then I literally had to stand up and see all the servers hanging around the cashier laughing and not giving a damn. I said *out loud.. Can I pleeeeease order? The next reaction just stunned me. All three just looked away and looked down as if they were checking their phones and counting money?!??? Seriously??? After one server was finished with whatever bs she was doing, she walked up to my table like nothing and asked me what I want to get. At this moment, I'm already disgusted by the service here. I told Felisha, my server a short stack of Macadamia Nut and Carrot Cakes.. also Portuguese sausage and eggs.. for an extra charge, I substituted with egg whites. From how things are going, I also asked for two to go boxes, because I wasn't going to stay much longer. Waiting is Riiiiidiculous here.

My pancakes came and unfortunately both were tasteless and dry even with all that syrup and cream cheese toppings. Then my server brings the egg whites separate and the Portuguese sausage separate.. I'm like.. you have to be kidding me right?!! Does she not know I came here before and order this very dish to know she messed up on my order. Since she never came around after dropping off my food I waved down to catch another server/busser? and asked him... doesn't the Portuguese sausage and eggs come with hash browns??? He looked so puzzled and slowly said yes..... yes \"wait\" a minute. Then another five minutes later my server comes by and said oh I thought you wanted them separate. I told her no I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs entree. It does come with hash browns right? She goes.. yes here you go and was about to turn around and walk away... Not so fast... I told her.. Excuse me... she turned around and I go, since I ordered the entree.. it includes a side of pancakes doesn't it?? She goes.. yes it does. I look at her and she looks at me like yea so?!? I told her.... Soooo am I going to get a side of pancakes or ??? She goes well what kind you want? I'm like whatever kind comes with this entree. She goes well we have buttermilk or for an extra charge red velvet. I told her I just want what comes with the entree. If I didn't say anything, she wasn't even going to bother correcting my order and think I haven't dined here.. more so think I don't know what this entree includes. Not that slick sweetheart. I'm going to get what I'm paying for not half ass. That right there was wrongly done. Not nice to treat a repeat guest or any guest for that matter. The hash brown was semi-cooked, portuguese sausage was over cooked and extremely dry like burned wood chips. The only thing that came out good out of this experience was the eggs whites. I can't believe the service here and the worst part is it WASN'T even busy at all. Unacceptable.

Thank goodness I asked for my to go boxes, it came in handy and again, I had to ask a different server/cashier if I can get a container cover for the syrup and cream cheese. This place should be called Long Wait that Stacks Up, because obviously that's all I experienced here. And of course the sneaky server Felisha that tried to get away in not offering me the pancakes that came with the meal. Lazy. Even though it's the last hour, you should always treat the guest as if they are your first, middle, or last. They are still your guest!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Babystacks. I am a regular here and now am a regular at the new Centennial location that just opened up closer to me. I've been coming to Babystacks for a few years now. The service is always good. The employees are all very friendly and good at what they do. They have all the regular breakfast foods that most brunch places have along with some that have a twist and a few Hawaiian dishes. The specialty is of course their pancakes with so many varieties to chose from. I've had most of the things are their menu and am hardly ever disappointed. The only down side is that the buffalo location tends to get crowded so be prepared to wait. But to me that just goes to show you that everyone that comes here is always willing to wait. This place is on my list of highly recommended places to try."}
{"text":"Really fast service! Pancakes were delicious!  A little too much baking soda but still the bananas foster pancakes were yummy. Only got the short stack (3 pancakes) but it was so filling that I didn't even finish lol"}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this restaurant from my husband but when I got there, I was not impressed. The pancakes were great but the service we received today was horrible. 

Our waitress took our drink orders- we ordered 2 coffees, one water and one Pepsi. We only received 1 coffee and 2 waters and no soda. We asked the waitress for another coffee and the soda and she tried to correct us and told us we didn't order it. Our table had no sugar so we didn't have sugar for the one coffee as well. 10 minutes later, I received my coffee and my husband got his soda about the same time our food came out.

The food was great and the pancakes are one of a kind! I'm not complaining about that at all! The short stacks comes with 3 pancakes and the regular comes with 5. You may think 3 cakes aren't enough but they're good sized pancakes with toppings on them! If you order a meal, you can add a stack of 2 pancakes for 1.75 more or less- that's a dang good deal too!

Our waitress came back to make sure everything was okay and we said we needed some sugar for the coffee, a to go box and a refill on the drinks... We got the box and sugar but refill. So my boyfriend had nothing left to drink at all. We packed our to go box and our waitress offered us a refill- which was too late because we were already about to leave and pay. We still tipped her the 15%, not for good service but we didn't want to be rude. 

When we paid, we told the cashier what happened and he was kind enough to offer us a refund on the drinks or a drink to go but at that point, we just wanted to leave. 

All in all, We will return to baby stacks again but hopefully we won't have that girl as our waitress."}
{"text":"My in-laws are all hip and stuff and has heard of the hype surrounding babystacks and proceeded to take us here to celebrate my sweet girl's dance recital. The wait was 20 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't too bad, and for once, we were at a restaurant where my in-laws being white, were the ones who were outnumbered!! Muahahahaha. 

The atmosphere is very casual, and not bad for a brunch place. I ordered the Huntington omelette and I wish I heeded Alana's review saying to stay away from it. It was pretty miserable. Everyone else at the table loved their food, but mine was by far the worst. An omelette with probably 2? or 1 1/2? pieces of bacon cut up into the omelette with nearly non-existent cheddar cheese mixed into the eggs, and half of an over-riped avocado slices on top. I will NEVER order that again. I got the specialty Almond Joy pancakes & I guess this was my fault, but I didn't expect a chocolate batter, because I am not a big fan of chocolate cakes or chocolate pastries, but obviously, this came with chocolate pancakes, with slices almonds, coconut, and whipped cream. They weren't THAT sweet, but I wish I ordered something else.

My husband got the country fried steak which I tried a piece of and was very tasty. He ordered banana cream pie pancakes which were the best of the table. My children had s'mores pancakes which came with marshmallows and graham cracker crumbles. I didn't try them, but they were engulfed in seconds since I try to limit their sugar intake. This was certainly a treat for them. They also had the breakfast combo with eggs and bacon. The bacon was great! Thick and perfectly cooked to a crisp. The carrot cake pancakes that my mother in law ordered were a flop. WAY too heavy and cake-like rather than light and fluffy like pancakes should be. I don't know if I would be back as I already have a favorite brunch spot, and we seldom go to brunch, but I can see the appeal of specialty pancakes and I would say to stick to those, and stay away from the Huntington omelette."}
{"text":"A casual local place off the strip. Great eats for great price. I had the chili loco moco that was good. If you like Filipino food or want to try it, it's a good place to do so. It's  a fusion hut.. yum yum"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious and made to order, the service was awesome and the vibe is chill. Definitely coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"So I'll admit, I need to give this place another visit soon. The selections on their menu sound awesome, but I was craving a BLT. Great sandwich with Applewood bacon, crisp iceberg and tomatoes. I wanted to keep it lean on my side so I paid additional for fruit. It was a great selection of melon, grapes and strawberries. 
The best part of my meal was the service. From the moment the gentleman greeted me at the front door and seated me. To the awesome service I got from my server Efrain. He promptly took my drink order, returned with it, and asked if I had any questions about their menu. He then took my order, served to me in a timely order and checked on me several times. That's great service. 
I hope to return soon and try one of their many flavorful pancakes."}

{"text":"Totally psyched to discover another awesome brunch place off the strip!

**Loco Moco--Order this with the sausage patty instead of the regular beef patty. It will change your view of Loco Moco forever! Go with the garlic rice, too. A must!

**Kalua Pork Benedicts-Disappointed! The flavors didn't work well together and it was so bland. I only had a few bites and gave up...I was tremendously unsatisfied that I had to order another Loco Moco to fill in that void!  

**Red Velvet Pancakes-BOMB! It's better to eat this fresh so if you plan to eat this for dessert like me, order the pancakes when you're halfway through your savory dish. The cream cheese syrup is just amazing and not too sweet! Try not to add too much of the whipped cream in each bite so you can really enjoy the flavors of the pancake. For me, the short stack is just the perfect portion. 

**Lemon Ricotta Pancakes-Just wonderful! It's light, fluffy, and simply refreshing. The citrus flavor of the lemon is really enhanced with the cream cheese syrup. There's no short stack option for this so plan to share because it's huge. 

**Portuguese sausage sliders-Not impressed. Hawaiian rolls with Portuguese sausage and eggs scrambled with green onions. It's good but it's something you can make yourself at home..maybe better! 

Servers here were so attentive and friendly. We came here for Mother's Day brunch so it was really busy. That didn't stop them from giving us good service. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The front door greeter on New Year's Eve was very friendly, the server Truc was excellent, cashier was very friendly. I have been trying different cafes lately and find I always get bad service if I come in by myself, but I sat at the bar area here and I got great service, coffee was always filled, checked up on often. And they were busy! I totally forgot after getting change to tip the waitress, so I ran back in and left the tip on the counter so hopefully she doesn't think I stiffed her! Thank you for a good New Year's Eve morning :)"}
{"text":"I went here on grand opening day on June 10, 2016 and had a great experience! Surprisingly, there was not a long wait and we got amazing service. The menu is not different from the other locations, and that's understandable, why change a good thing?

I tried the creamsicle pancakes this time and they were so good! They are my second favorite, after the red velvet pancakes. My husband had the Mexican skillet and it was very good. It wasn't much different from other restaurants, I'm sure, but it was classically good. 

Anyway, I'm so glad this is close to home! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday before the crowds and grabbed a spot at the counter. I stayed a while and watched it get busy at lunchtime. The wait staff was friendly, although they stopped checking on me after the first 30 min I was there. It was hard to get my drink refilled!

Spam fried rice with garlic rice was delicious, especially with a little sriracha on the side. The banana cream pie pancakes were to die for! Just about melted in your mouth and wasn't overly sweet.

Will definitely return to try the adobo fried rice and some of their other pancake varietals. But it may only be on a weekday... This place gets packed on the weekend with lines out the door!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but not worth the rude staff (at the door) and a 60 minute wait. I have certainly had worse breakfasts - but I have had better too.

Would I come back - sure (the food is worth it) but, once they get a bigger than 50 seat dining room and a better attitude."}
{"text":"Limited seating and not a lot of space between tables for the location on Stephanie.  There really isn't anything to recommend the place other than good food and diverse menu.  We go here off hours because we just don't want to go through the hassle of listening to the conversation beside us or vice versa."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST WITH THE BEST PANCAKES!!! I come here several times a month for breakfast with either friends or family to indulge in a hearty meal. 
I love the friendly staff and amazing food. My go to is the build your own skillet with red velvet pancakes - can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Went here with my brothers and the wait staff was great at explaining the menu and recommending some of their top sellers. I'm sure all the other reviews claim how great the red velvet pancakes are and I have to echo those sentiments as well. Great service and only wished there was more room because it does get packed."}
{"text":"This place is typically packed out on the weekends, especially Saturday and Sunday mornings...however, the wait is worth it. The red velvet pancakes are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. Loco Moco and upgrade to red velvet pancakes is my usual."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and it was a 30 minute wait luckily. We ordered Loco Moco, chili moco, chicken tenders, crepes, and red velvet pancakes. Food came out within 10 minutes. Yay!! Our server was excellent, she took care of us."}
{"text":"It is rare that i get overwhelmed on what to order, but there were just to many great options. I had to go back two days just to try all the good stuff. I love to go off strip to find hidden gems and Baby Stacks is defiantly one. Very rare you find SPAM and eggs on the menu. But Pancakes is were they shine the banana cream pie pancakes were off the chart. I had to come back the next day to try the Red velvet pancakes and the Almond Joy Pancakes. i didn't get to the Orange or the lemon ricotta pancakes but i will be back."}
{"text":"The service was really great. It's a pretty small place so you feel kind of crammed in but a lot of breakfast spots are like that. I got the breakfast burrito with potatoes on the side. The bacon was not crispy at all even though it specifies that it is on the menu.  It was only slightly cooked but I was (currently still am) hungover so I couldn't bare to wait any longer and decided just to go for it. It wasn't great and the potatoes were barely cooked. I'm a fan of crispy everything so this place was really just meh. The banana foster pancakes were good but I still prefer other breakfast spots to this one. I gave it 3 stars because they have great service and it was fine. I just expect more out of brunch. I'm a brunch snob.  Whatever."}
{"text":"Why anyone would eat at Ihop over this place?Oh yeah, the wait.   Always seems to  be busy.   I was hoping the chose a larger place for the second location.   You come here for the pancakes.  I ordered  a Kahlua pork Benedicta side of cinnabon panckes and my friend had the red velvet cakes.  The benedict was good but not anything special.  The pancakes are the star of the show.   I've had red velvet pancakes at other places but there's is better.   Service was also good."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas for my friends' wedding and my friends kept raving about this BabyStacks place.  I'm not huge on breakfast foods, but I was pleasantly surprised by BabyStacks.  I had the Spam scramble which was good.  The Furikake on top really cut through the saltiness of the Spam.  The scramble came with a side of pancakes, I got the white chocolate macadamia pancakes.  They were good but the white chocolate macadamia part of the pancakes was on top and it was difficult to get a perfect bite.  Otherwise they were just regular pancakes with toppings.  My friend and I shared the red velvet pancakes and OMG they are to die for!  I woke up in my bed in Sacramento the next day craving those pancakes.  The cream cheese syrup wasn't too sweet.  It was just right and the red velvet pancakes were so fluffy.  I wish I had just gotten those pancakes by themselves.

GET THE RED VELVET PANCAKES EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Felisha was a great server! Very friendly and nice. She knew what to recommend and brought drinks and the food out fast even though it was really busy! I got a swish mushroom burger and it was good but I thought the patty could've had more seasonings. The fries were thinner than I like but they were so crispy and good that I didn't even mind. I tried my boyfriends smores pancakes and they were so delicious! The plates are a little smaller than I'd like but I'm comfortably full. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hostess was not friendly.  We were not greeted.  Once we were seated our server was slow and inattentive.  I asked for crispy bacon w/ my meal, the server said \"of course, no problem.\" it came floppy.  We didn't see our server again until we were about ready to leave.  We mentioned it, she was going to charge us for an additional side of bacon, until she took it back to the kitchen and it came incinerated- like they threw it in the microwave for 5 minutes.
The tortilla on the breakfast burrito lacked moisture as well.  The one good thing is the blueberry pancakes.  That is the silver lining."}
{"text":"Had family in town visiting and this was our departure breakfast.  We had a late start so we arrived about 30 minutes before they closed. The place had few tables left from what  I am sure was a busy breakfast service.  I have never been a fan of sweet items for breakfast such as pancakes or waffles so I was hoping for someone else to order one of there delicious choices Babystacks has to offer, and I could sample.  Bacon and eggs is more for me to start my day but I do love a good omelet to start my day.  SO that what I did. A build your own where you could select a cheese, meat and two veggies.  I ended up making a selection that was much like a \"Denver Omelet\" and try the seasoned potatoes and wheat toast.  this is a meal that will never let me down.

When the meal came out my omelet was a little small for my eyes but it would do the trick.  So with everyone selections I was able to try the crepes which were sweet, fluffy and delicious. I was able to try the s'more's pancakes as well which was more of the same.  Good but too sweet for me.  Next time I hope some one orders the \"Red Velvet\" pancakes everyone has been raving about.  As for me I might be more adventurous and try the portuguise sausage.  It has been awhile since I have tasted these and if I remember right they were tasty. 

After looking on Yelp there are apparently more than one of these places in Vegas.  If you have tried one you have tried them all.  I will probably stay close to home and not seek out the others locs.  No need to burn the gas.

2nd visit 

Ordered the Lolo's Adobe fried rice special. This specialty dish is an omlette with shredded chicken and fried rice stuffed inside and garnished with green onions.  The filling with chicken and rice was a little salty for my taste mostly because of the heavy soy sauce marinade of the adobo. 

I was also able to try the portuguise sausage this visit.  Not very impressed, it tasted like hills hire farms ring bologna.  I have had homeade portuguise sausage which had a nice spice to it. This had almost no flavor in my opinion."}
{"text":"Yummie! Red Velvet Pancakes and Kalua Pork Eggs Benedict were AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Great and fast customer service! This place gets busy. We were seated and served very quickly and the waiters/waitresses were awesome! Our food  came out quick and was delicious! We got the spam and eggs with garlic rice ($1 extra, but is worth it), and the red velvet pancakes, which was delicious! They have a huge food selection...it was hard to decide what to order, but I'm sure everything is delicious! 

Would definitely recommend this place! Will be back."}
{"text":"On vaca from Cali had the Red Velvet Pancakes, simply amazing 5/5 stars. Ricks Adobo Rice Omelette  delicious, but a little dry. I recommend adding cheese for moisture 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good breakfast place for pancakes and came across this. The menu struck my sweet tooth, so we gave it a try.

The pancakes were disappointing. A butterfinger pancake was just plain pancakes with some butter finger crumbles sprinkled on top. An oreo pancake was a chocolate pancake with some vanilla creme. Kind of bland and very uninspired. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"An incredible place to go for breakfast (I have only been on the weekend). Make sure you are ok with waiting to be sat, there is always a waiting list (20 to 35 minutes). The food is cooked with love and the Red Velevet pancakes and kahlua  egs benedict are both incredibly memorable. When a place like this can consistently deliver me eggs benedict with slow roasted Pork on it and the english muffin is crunchy every time it's impressive. As is the fact that the RV pancakes are more like a pancake then a breakfast sugary cupcake you will wish you got 2 orders. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the wait to sit down. Not sure if that is fair so consider this a 5 star if you are less of an ass#$(* then I."}
{"text":"My Absolute Favorite Sunday Spot :)
Food is amazingly delicious! Don't come here, I don't like waiting in line!!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS & even when there is a long line, the wait isn't too bad and the food comes fast. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Creative assortment of food, huge portions, friendly staff... BabyStacks was so good we hit 'em up back-to-back days during our Vegas trip. We tried the Kahlua Pig Benedict (smoky goodness), BYOB. (built  my own omelet - egg whites, bacon, spinach, cheese, topped with green sauce - HUGE), Adobo Fried Rice (wasn't a fan, but a staple for everyone else), Spam, Eggs, and Rice and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs (need no further explicative needed), and they all came with pancakes. Not your everyday buttermilk Bisquick pancakes, but pancakes the BabyStacks way. Represented in order of deliciousness, we had Butterfinger (peanut butter batter, seriously... yeah), Orange Creamsicle with cream cheese sauce (really... yeah really, that's what the ice cream man said), Almond Joy (get a glass of milk for this chocolate, coconut wonder), Smores (build me a campfire, cause I'm eating), Banana Cream (\"What's that behind you?\" as I finish your monkey stack), and White Chocolate Macadamia (stick to this in cookie form). All-in-all, a great way to start your day (afternoon in Vegas) is at BabyStacks."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and tried different breakfast specials with different pancakes and I must say they never dissapoint. This is one of my favorite place to dine in Henderson. Not to mention the friendly servers that make you feel welcome. Too bad they don't open late but it's definitely worth going there for breakfast or ealy lunch."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, more than ample portions, comfortable atmosphere, and great priced.  This is the kind of place I've been looking for to take family and friends for breakfast!  Will definitely return here next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes and chicken adobo fried rice omelettes a MUST!  I'm so sad I live in LA... I miss them!"}
{"text":"Amazing food ideas all around. I always have a very hard time deciding what to order because everything look s soooooo good,,red velvet pancakes n spam sliders my top 2 picks. Im proud to bring family from out of town and my local friends to this joint."}
{"text":"First timer, food was okay, service was ok. The cashier was excellent..restaurant is small and not well ventilated. Loved the music."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!  The red velvet pancakes are A M A Z I N G!  Also tried the lemon ricotta, and those were a hit as well!  Loved this place, and will be back next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"My friends and I usually eat at this restaurant and if pretty much had a halfway decent experience! We went here recently and was shown a great deal of disrespect! We were asked to be seated and we're not seated! The restaurant was empty by the way! And they also said that because one person in our group had not arrived yet that they would not seat us! The guy who was helping us was a very flamboyant homosexual and was very attitude e and disrespectful! We are grown men who are born and raised in this city and should not have to deal with this type of disrespect from a little punk! Will definitely never be eating at this establishment ever again! We will definitely be spreading the word of the unprofessionalism of this restaurant! And when we called to ask for the manager the little punk hung up on us and would not put one on the phone!"}
{"text":"Every single thing was scrumptious-- coming from a person who is kind of indifferent to breakfast foods, trust this review. The table ordered country fried steak and eggs, loco moco, honey French toast, red velvet baby stacks, buttermilk baby stacks, chili skillet, and strawberry Nutella crepes. Every single bite was fresh, aesthetically appealing, and delicious.

We arrived 15 minutes before closing yet there was no sign of disgruntlement from any of the staff. Our server was extremely sweet-- and in celebration of a birthday, we were given a buttermilk baby stack with a candle. 

Sweet food... Sweet service..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch in North Summerlin, for sure. Best huevos rancheros I've ever had, great service, coffee and water refills before you even ask, and AMAZING pancakes. Amazing. Like 30 different kinds and flavors, and they're small so your group could get multiple flavors to try and share. Red Velvet, cookies and cream, classic chocolate chip, and S'more are some of my favorites. Additionally, some of the dishes are influenced by Filipino island flavors, like Rick's adobo fried rice \"omelette\" and the Kahlua pig Benedict--the bomb! Not a ton of seating, and it's a popular place so expect a little wait, but it's totally worth it. My favorite place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried it this morning and boy it was delicious!

I had the Wheat French Toast. I love the crunchy bite! A little hard to break apart, but good.

My love had your Red Velvet Pancakes and it was DIVINE! I had a bite, not going to lie haha. I think it tasted better without the chocolate toppings, but very good. I'll be back and I'll try some of your pancakes next time."}
{"text":"Breakfast good only thing they give no senior discount kinda shows no respect for seniors"}
{"text":"Christopher was our waiter who was fantastic. We walked in at 1pm and it was still pretty busy, but no wait for seating.This was our first time here so we ordered the buttermilk pancakes which were satisfactory, the eggs and ham were overcooked and had black marks from being overcooked. Our waiter told us we should have tried the flavored pancakes since that what they are known for and it being our first time. 

Overall the service was better then the food, most likely wont be back."}
{"text":"As other bad reviews have already stated, they don't know how to effectively host so they over-quote wait times by 30 min. If they call you in 15 minutes and you're not waiting right there, you're out of luck. 

Once we got sat, they rushed us to order. The food arrived cold and burnt; kind of an oxymoron. We had to ask for the additional items we ordered that we never received. We still never got our complete orders but were certainly charged for them. They drop the check with the food and that's where the service, or lack thereof, ends.

While paying my bill, the girl asked how everything was. I noticed the big sign at their host stand that said, \"be nice or leave!\" so I decided to not ruffle any feather since mine already were. With a sign like that, they don't care in the first place.

Oh well. We'll find another place more deserving of our time, money and business."}
{"text":"I took my friend there past Friday, it wasn't busy yet and the staff was very friendly. The food came out fast and hot and the server was very helpful. About the food the only thing I can say is that it was delicious, we build our own omelette and we had on the side the S'mores pancakes (best pancakes I've ever tried ). Love this place, I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Babystacks on the weekend is always packed! But the food and service is always worrh the wait!"}
{"text":"S'mores, red velvet and oh so many decadent choices of pancakes! But unfortunately I'm not much of a pancake person and wanted eggs. The omelette had four eggs! That's way too many for me! So due to other choices to balance out I had two egg breakfast. I wanted to pick something different but there weren't many healthy choices. Carbs, carbs and more heavy carbs!!! I mean I could make the omelette an egg white omelette but it's an up charge and I like eggs. But the eggs did come out the way I like, the rye toast was good and the fruit salad was a good variety! 
Grapes, berries and melon was nice. He got the full heavy breakfast deal as he wanted hash browns and he was quiet and smiling so was happy.
The customer service was great as our waitress was attentive and friendly. Nice little set up and didn't have to wait long. Good little place but for the type of breakfast I like it's average and I'll probably stick to other places."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the Las Vegas valley.  Everything is cooked to order and always served hot.  The wait staff is always friendly.  The menu is just the right size with enough diversity to please most everyone, but small enough to ensure high quality with every dish.  

Keep in mind they won't seat partial parties.  The original location on north Buffalo is very small so plan accordingly.  If you love breakfast, definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is probably my favorite meal and Babystacks is definitely my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas.  I've eaten many times at the original and second locations on Buffalo, and quite a few times at the third location that opened in Centennial Hills not too long ago.  Although I haven't tried the newest location in Henderson, I have no doubt the food and service meets the same high standard as the other locations.

As the name implies, the featured breakfast item on the menu is pancakes, and if you like pancakes, you have a great assortment to choose from (including Red Velvet, Cinnebun, White Chocolate Chip Macadamia, Carrot Cake, and many more).  At last count there are 18 specialty pancakes in addition to traditional, and you can have them as your main course, or you can get pancakes as a side to complement a different breakfast item.  Watch out:  they're delicious and the stacks are big!  Go with a half stack unless you're truly hungry.

But Babystacks does more than pancakes!  Their other menu items are just as delicious and also range from traditional fare including a variety of eggs cooked to order, omelets and Eggs Benedict, French Toast, crepes, but they also have a few dishes unique to the shop.  Be sure to check out the Kalua Grilled Cheese, the Portuguese (or Spam) sliders, or Rick's Adobo Fried Rice for starts.

Things to remember:  The North Buffalo location is tiny; the South Buffalo location is much larger and more comfortable, as is the one in Centennial Hills.  Also, they won't seat incomplete parties, so have everyone together when you arrive.  On weekends, every location I've visited will quickly fill up and a line will form on weekends.  Go early to be there when they open, or bring a book to enjoy during the wait.  Keep in mind though:  the wait is worth it!

Now go get your breakfast on!"}
{"text":"I just had to see what all the hype was all about! In the end, my taste buds definitely agreed. I had a Spanish influenced omelet & the white chocolate macadamia pancakes. Both tasted amazing! The pancakes made a perfect dessert after breakfast. I'm probably the biggest white chocolate lover. However, their service was ok. We were easy customers who ordered immediately & left quickly. The only request I had was for a take-out box, & my male server must have forgotten. I wish I could have given them 5 stars. The only other reason was because there were a few little ants on our table and walll, which our table leaned up against. My boyfriend & I tolerated it & didn't mention it. We'll definitely be back at this Hawaiian-like breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Our server was super sweet and attentive. I didnt expect the service to be that good because they were really busy. Its a really tiny place so we came early 8am on sunday to beat the crowd otherwise the wait is 45 min or longer. Red velvet pancakes were great and I am not really a pancake person which says a lot about the pancakes. The nutella crepe wasnt as good as the red velvet but it was ok, just a little soggy. The chicken fried adobo is a must try as well."}
{"text":"Pumpkin pancakes we delicious! Spam,eggs, rice, and gravy weren't too shabby. Brown gravy used seemed like any normal brown gravy from a package. Service was really bad. Our server forgot about us. So we sat in a corner for 15 minutes before another server came over and took care of us."}
{"text":"Met a friend for breakfast not too long along ago.  I enjoy the consistency babystacks offers as a brand.  I haven't had a bad experience at any of their Vegas locations.  Came in on a Friday morning and it was fairly busy but we opted to sit at the breakfast bar.  Service was food and the food came out quickly.  The bacon was a bit over cooked but nothing to deter me.  I will certainly continue to recommend babystacks as a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Prices are reasonable. They nailed my omelet order and the specialty pancakes (got banana fosters) are best thing EVER! The place is small so service is always great. There always seems to be a line but it moved fast. You've got to try it."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I wanted to try everything! I finally made up my mind and got the cookie butter french toast (which was absolutely amazing by the way), the red velvet pancakes, and the Rick's adobo fried rice. As I was eating the adobo, I couldn't help but to notice the egg-to-rice ratio. There was simply too much egg for it to be considered an omelette. 

I've always been sketchy about breakfast food but after my experience with the French toast, I've decided that brunch is a must for me every weekend. If you let the whip cream melt for a bit before eating your french toast/pancake, it is definitely worth it! 

The one thing I wished for was that the location was bigger. There was a tremendous amount of people waiting and it was about a 45-minute wait for three which is pretty excessive for a brunch place. 

Overall, I was highly satisfied with BabyStacks and can not wait to come back on my next trip to Vegas! YUM!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff, but the food was just okay relative to the great reviews I've read. The pancakes were average, and a little on the dry side. Again, nice folks, but a disappointing breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Hand down my favorite breakfast spot in Henderson.  This is my go to breakfast/brunch spot to take all my visitors.  

If you love pancakes this is place is for you.  My favorite is the Carrot Cake pan cake with the yummy cream cheese frosting, YUMMMMM!

You can't go wrong with the Adobo pulled pork fried rice!  Generous amount of pulled pork mixed in fried rice and all of its juicy goodness, wrapped like a burrito with a thin tortilla made from a fried egg.  Warning: It is very heavy and filling!  

If that doesn't tickle your fancy, the Loco Moco is pretty good!  The patty though was on the dry side, but keep in mind, I like my meat medium rare to rare.  Next time I order this I would ask them to cook it to medium.  

Ambiance gives a smaller mom and pop feel to the restaurant with homey decor.  

Service was excellent, checked on often enough but not intrusive :)

If you are even thinking about this place, GO! You will not be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in the entire city of Las Vegas, hands down. They have such a wide selection of unique pancake creations and their menu is extensive. I have yet to be disappointed from anything I've ordered. I recently went in and ordered their seasonal Gingerbread pancakes... AMAZING! It had egg nog flavored cream and another sweet white Christmas candy topping. Their portions are perfect, I usually have some to take home unless I go in there starving lol. I highly recommend Baby Stacks, they are my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I came in for a to-go order... things did not start out very smgeroothly. the hostess seemed to be more preoccupied with going through her motions rather than doing customer service. I asked her if she'd like to see the order. she gave me a hasty \"NO\" So i start reading the order out to her and while i was in mid sentence she interrupts to ask me how i want the steak cooked. Which would have been FINE if she let me end my statement. I ask her if its necessary to interrupt me while i'm speaking and she says \"don't yell at me.\" its a loud cafe! i wasn't \"YELLING\" 

I then give her the second Item which she had me repeat because she didn't hear me, this was a hamburger by the way. i give her the last item... and the ticket is done. She said it would be ready in 15 minutes. 15 minutes pass... she shows me the food. and i ask where the hamburger is. She claims I \"never ordered\" one. I retell her of how i repeated my self earlier. She replies that she had read back the order to me sans hamburger and i okayed it. I pushed back a bnit and said \"did you really? are you absolutely certain you read it back to me?\" She then said \"do you want to speak to the manager?\" I said \"absolutely\"

The Manager comes over and tells me the hostess had said I \"wanted to cancel the entire ticket and get a refund.\" I explained that this was untrue as all i wanted was the missing item to be included. I also asked if it was necessary for the hostess to be condescending. I got no answer and the Manager fixed the ticket. 8 minutes later i got the hamburger.

it was completely unnecessary to go through all of that. if the hostess would have just added the hamburger and not attempt to shift blame onto the customer this all could have been avoided. won't ever eat there again."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I had the banana cream pie pancakes and my wife had carrot cake. Both were excellent choices and we will be back"}
{"text":"HOLY PETE. Next time you are in Vegas, and want a quality breakfast - go to this place. This was the best commercial breakfast I have ever had. EVERYTHING was fresh and hot. I had the Texan skillet. Bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheese side of papas, comes w two of the most light and fluffy pancakes. I do not know who they have cooking in the back, or running this place but it is wonderful. Friendly staff too. A little bit of a wait as place is small, but absolutely worth it! Salsa was good. Made with fresh tomatoes and the flavor was beyond good. Love this place and will see you next time!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. The price a little high for the food portions. I order a Nutella crape with banana it was $4ish literally it was a single small crape rolled like a taquito. My son order biscuits N gravy with sausage link. I felt like the lols where so small. I order eggs portugués sausage yup it was one sausage."}
{"text":"Whether you are a NV resident of traveling from out of town. This is a must visit! 

My family and I, visiting from CA, decided to visit 
original restaurants rather than the typical food provided by the venues of the Strip. I was craving pancakes and searched up this location which is a good 20 minute drive from Downtown Las Vegas. 

This Filipino-Hawaiian restaurant did not disappoint. We arrived at the peak of lunch and did not wait too long until we were seated. The venue displayed a unique style which I enjoyed. Additionally the service and the employees were delightful and kind! 

The food was exceptional. Whether it was their vast selection of pancakes, omelettes, or more...there was definitely options for everyone. My family of 5 ordered different plates and were all satisfied! The food did take a while to arrive at our table, however. But the taste was original and great for individual portions! 

I will definitely be back soon! Mahalo & Salamat!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was prepared for the line. It did not live up to my expectations, although it was decent. 
I had the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes. They were dense and doughy, not fluffy at all. The server (BTW-the servers were all fantastic) said they had new kitchen staff.
I will give this place another try soon, but right now I'm not super impressed."}
{"text":"Went here today and got terrible service and a screwed up order, they did fix it but when I got my food back the side items were cold. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our first time and we loved it!!  The staff were nice and friendly, the place was clean, service was fast and food was awesome!  My co worker told us about this place and we're glad we tried it!!  The locco moco was my fave and their fried rice too!  We also ordered their famous red velvet pancake and the rock road and the cookies and cream!  All delish!!!!  Can't wait to be back when in Vegas!!  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Small quaint cafe for small groups. So many different choices and each one Ono."}
{"text":"I was just going through my check ins and saw I did not review Babystacks!!  This place rocks; I think there is something here for everyone!  Pancakes, real good pancakes, can't wait to eat here again on my next visit to Vegas.  Sorry, it's been a a couple of months since I went here, but, if you are thinking, how good can pancakes really be; wait no longer, get yourself in here and get some.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast with incredible service! The cafe was super busy when we came in on a Sunday morning, but we didn't have to wait too long. I got to try the Nutella pancakes, Portuguese sausage dish, and spam dish, and all were spectacular. Service was fast with friendly employees. I don't live in the area, but would highly recommend this delicious breakfast spot in Henderson."}
{"text":"My family loves babystacks.  It's our first time going to the location on Bluediamond... 
We got our usual loco moco dish with garlic fried rice.  However, this time our garlic rice was more like onion rice. They roughly diced huuuuge pieces of onion and there were so many pieces in  the rice I had to pick out all that I could out.  Huge chopped raw onion in the garlic rice killed the experience for us. Not sure why it was in the rice this time but it was not good.  From a cook family to another, I'm sorry but I don't think we will be coming back for that. Which sucks because this location is closer to home. We asked for extra gravy twice, our server forgot. We went early so it wasn't busy. We asked for a different drink and they forgot that until the food came out as well.  No one came to refill my water either. I don't like to complain but those are basic restaurant services.  :)"}
{"text":"Babystacks is one of my favorite breakfast spots. They put some flavor in the classic breakfast staples like omelettes and pancakes.

They have so many choices on their menu to choose from. I usually like to get the Chili Moco and/or the Bana Foster Pancakes. Their pancakes have the best consistency/texture! Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice is something you can never go wrong with either if you've never had it. 

Babystacks can be very busy depending on when you go, but it's definitely worth the wait. Once you actually get seated the food is served pretty quickly from when you order."}
{"text":"I want my baby back baby back baby back, Babyyyyy BabyStacks!!

I finally decided that I must must must try this place after all the wonderful things that I have heard about it.  I have yet to, and yes this makes me incredibly sad, taste the pancakes, because I'm on my special high protein diet at the moment. However, I have had the bacon, sausage, Peruvian sausages, eggs, and an omelet so far.  They have all been ever so tasty.  The eggs were exactly how I ordered them, they have yet to mess up an order and its always ready faster than they say, which is nice when you're in a time crunch.  

I have yet sat down in the restaurant because I have seen how crazy busy it gets so I can't rate the service there but the hostess is wonderful and always smiling- HUGE for customer satisfaction. 

I can't wait to try the pancakes and update this review!"}
{"text":"Their food is DELICIOUS! Seems to be busy when we go. I've made it a must-have on our way home from Las Vegas. Their staff always keeps us in check and is very sweet. Food came put quickly and always pleases our satisfaction. Wouldn't wanna have breakfast anywhere else, when we're around!"}
{"text":"We loved Baby Stacks and Danielle was a wonderful waitress .. so friendly and accommodating!! The food was excellent and we will be back for more !!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to if you are craving pancakes or Hawaiian inspired food. I ordered the spam scramble with garlic rice, this was very good. I know this place is known for their pancakes especially the red velvet ones but i don't really like red velvet so i tried the something else. So I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, i felt like it tasted like a regular pancake nothing to special. The feel in the restaurant is very chill has great music almost made me feel like i was in Hawaii and not Las Vegas. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"You will miss out if you pass up on the Red Velvet pancakes!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Looking at Yelp and checking all the crazy pancakes they had to offer, I was excited to try this place. When I tasted the food, excitement ended.

Let me say that the service was great. No problems in that area. I ordered the carrot cake pancakes.  Came with some icing to serve as a syrup.  I was like okay this is different...it should work.  It would have worked...if the pancakes weren't as dry as cardboard.  I felt like I was eating a carrot cake flavored notebook! I like syrup since it soaks in and helps in the event that you jack up and overcook the cakes.  The icing just sat on top and did nothing.  It was rough.  I'm not saying this place is bad.  I would give it another chance when I'm in town.  Maybe they just had an off day (with my plate).  With so many choices in pancakes, I would try it again.  Next time...better be on point tho!"}
{"text":"Just thinking of the food and writing this review is making me want to schedule my next trip to Vegas. 

My daughter and I came to BabyStacks on a Saturday around 8:30am.  I'm glad we did because when we were leaving around 10am, there was already a line out the door.  We were greeted and got seated right away.  We ordered the following:

Portuguese sausage omelet with a stack of Red Velvet pancakes ($12).  It had rice, Portuguese sausage, bacon and mushrooms.  Man it was so good!!!  The flavors exploded in my mouth.  I need to find a place near me that can serve this omelet.  The Red Velvet pancakes were so soft, moist and fluffy.  It comes with a cream cheese sauce that was devine.  

My daughter ordered the Frankie's Mini Breakfast ($6.25) -it had 1 egg, hash brown and 1 bacon.  My daughter enjoyed it. 

We are looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!!!! 

I had the banana foster short stack, the Huntington omelette with breakfast potatoes....OMG!!! A flavorfest in my mouth!

Highly Recommend this to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"The server Valerie was very nice and gave great recommendations! Great service overall! Omg the food was delicious, I had the loco moco and my sister had the banana fosters half stack and we could not be happier. Great seasoning on the burger and brown gravy. Bananas foster was not overpowering with sweetness and was definitely a favorite. we definitely finished both plates. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"If you like bland food with not even a hint of spice this is the place for you! Worst excuse for a breakfast burrito ever! The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old. Do your self a favor and go to Denny's!"}
{"text":"OMG, pancake orgasm!  This is the BEST place I been in a long time.  Pancakes are the perfect size and the favor, WOW!  I was very confused when ordering, but the server was very helpful and patient with me.  I went with his recommendations the huevos rancheros and carrot cake pancakes.  Awesome breakfast/lunch can't wait to visit this place again when we're in town again."}
{"text":"Yippee they opened one closer to my end of town! The first time we trekked over to the other end of town and the place was so popular we waited for a good 45 minutes for a table. But this location must be a secret still because we were seated right away, so I'm not sure if I should spread the word or be selfish and keep this to myself!! 

So of course we split the red velvet pancakes, it's like dessert for breakfast. I would recommend getting the short stack and splitting it between the table so everyone get a taste, don't know if I could eat an entire plate b/c it may be just a tad too sweet. The adobo omelette was also shared and that had really good flavor, but my absolute favorite, what I got up early for on my day off was the lemon ricotta pancakes (more like a crepe) sweet baby Jesus these brought tears to my eyes, ok maybe a little dramatic but they are so good I need to emphasize how good. So light and refreshing, I just add a tiny layer of butter and sprinkle powdered sugar and dip a bite at a time in the sauce it comes with. If you have a love for lemon like I do, you have to try these. And an added bonus for coffee drinkers, they serve half & half, not non-dairy creamer!! It's the little things in life, I know....."}
{"text":"There were 3 of us and we did a sampling of items on the menu, everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Saturday morning breakfast here. The blueberry pancakes were simple and DELICIOUS! My boyfriend enjoyed the S'mores pancakes as well. The service was great! Our server was so friendly. And multiple employees came by repeatedly and offered to refill our coffees. It was very nice."}
{"text":"Mahal kita!

My Filipino heart is so happy with this place. My family and I celebrated Memorial Day by having brunch here. From what I saw, most of the items on the menu are your typical breakfast/brunch items: eggs, bacon, crepes, etc. I'm sure they're all cooked great BUT I really encourage you to get the menu items that make this restaurant unique! It seems that a very popular choice is Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Yup, thats: fried rice lathered in chicken adobo sauce and chicken, wrapped in an egg omelette - making it look like a burrito. It is indeed very good, and that's an endorsement coming from a Pinoy. For those not too familiar with Filipino food, the rice/chicken part WILL be salty, so if you're not in to salty foods, this may not be for you.

Despite being a big fan of that dish, my family members around me got it so I just picked off their plates. I myself got the Kalua Benedict with country potatoes. What makes the benedict special is its shredded pork. The pork is so tender and moist, its a unique substitution from what you typically have on benedicts.

My dad and uncle both got the Loco Moco, and although I didn't get to taste it, they both gave their endorsements. We all ordered nutella crepes, and that plate is very large! We were able to split it among 6 peoples as a perfect dessert.

What a gem! Mahal na mahal kita!"}
{"text":"Great place for the traditional breakfast - pancakes, eggs, etc and also for the unique twists for the adventurous palate. 
Kalua pig benedict - a traditional eggs benedict with shredded kalua pig on top instead of the ham. Super flavorful, I actually prefer this version.
Adobo fried rice omelet - this is a monster! Maybe share with a friend and split some pancakes too. A generous portion of adobo fried rice wrapped in a very thin egg omlete. The fried rice is the bomb and hearty. Well seasoned and delicious.
Also, so many pancakes! So many flavors! You'll have to make at least 5 trips back just to sample them all. Yum"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Staff are very friendly. Hawaiian and Filipino food prepared with aloha."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand how so many people seem to rave about how great this place is. I have been there 3 times. Each and everytime I had poor service, with cold or barely warmed food.Am I really the only one who gets terrible service and cold food there? 3 times is enough for me, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Our server Lorena was the best server I've had in such a long time. The food here is definitely something to check out, and as a transient person, I have to admit that this is place is definitely fresh and unlike other places I've been to for breakfast food. The wait is a little long, but that's to be expected from how popular it seems to be. The food is great. Their food is sort of an American/Filipino/Hawaiian mix that is truly a unique combination. We ordered Lolo's adobo rice, Kalbi ribs, and the Nutella crepes. It was so good. I would definitely recommend this place to others. It's well worth the wait to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty popular breakfast spot. Every time I've been here the restaurant has been fully sat. I come back for the good Hawaiian fusion food, good music and bomb pancakes. All for reasonable prices! 

That being said, our server this time around sort of dulled the experience for us. I understand what it's like to have a full section and we're in no rush. She could've smiled once or even made eye contact. She did the bare minimum. 

All in all, my past experiences here have been great and that outweighs this one time. Everyone has a bad day I guess. I still left 20% because the rest of the staff was really busting their asses ! Ill be back."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places whenever we visit Las Vegas. We either hit up Babystacks after our long drive into the city, after a long night of drinking, or a fill up before we head out. Every time we've visited it has not disappointed. The general feel and vibe of the place is homey and friendly. The goats and servers are great and very helpful. They offer a variety and range of breakfast, brunch, and lunch items to cater to any tastes or cravings. One of our favorites is the loco moco with the garlic rice. We also like all of the various skillets they have. They are definitely known for their vast selections of pancakes. I think we're unconsciously working our way down flavortown to find our favorite, but believe me, all of the ones we've tried so far have been fantastic. 

The flavors and portions are large so come in hungry.

This place will continue to be a favorite spot of ours and the tradition will continue as long as we visit the beautiful city of Las Vegas. I have and will continue recommending Babystacks to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I don't review many places unless the are very memorable, either good or bad.  I like to review places to return to or avoid.

This is a wonderful place to find on a trip to Vegas.  Excellent and large selection for breakfast and lunch very nicely prepared.

We met a local couple while waiting for the restaurant to open who introduced us to Carlos, server extraordinaire, and other regulars.  A friendly, welcoming place that was comfortable without flash and pretentiousness."}
{"text":"Nice local place for breakfast. They have some yummy pancakes here. Love that they're from Hawaii too. They definitely show you much aloha."}
{"text":"All I can say is Yum!! Polynesian food and breakfast with an American punch! Seriously the only downfall is the size of the Resteraunt! It's always packed so come about 1 hour before you are actually hungry! I had the eggs Benedict and Lemon ricotta pancakes and I was in heaven!!! I always recommend Baby Stacks when family comes into town!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed both times! I thought it was interesting to combine Hawaiian style food with pancakes...lol. First time, I had the Loco Moco and Red Velvet pancakes. The second time, I had Adobo Fried Rice and Bananas Fosters pancakes. All were good, but the Adobo Fried Rice really stood out and tasted great. The Bananas Fosters pancakes are my favorite pancakes so far. I plan on trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for late breakfast on a Wednesday. Brand new looking, clean breakfast spot. This place was busy but didn't wait to be seated. (Well, I sat at the counter. 5 min. wait for table.)
I had Chili Moco with garlic rice and Portuguese sausage on the side. It was so good!! I loved their flavorful garlic rice. This meal satisfied my Hawaiian breakfast craving. I can't wait to try their Filipino breakfast next time. (chicken fried rice?)
The waitress, Danielle was sweet. She was very attentive. 
Only 4 counter seating available. It took me 5 minutes to find a parking spot for some reason... So Saturday or Sunday, parking could be very stressful."}
{"text":"Place was crowded but the wait time wasn't too bad, maybe 10 minutes or so.  Tried the Red Velvet Pancakes which were really yummy.  Their Chicken Adobo fried rice omelette was delicious if you're more into the savory.  Would've liked to have tried everything else on the menu but will have to look forward to the next time we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop after an 8-hr road trip.  We decided to try out this #1 ranked bday place in this area and it did not disappoint! The adobo fried rice is yum! The generous dollop of whipped cream made the full stack chocolate pancakes amazing! Our server was incredibly gracious and the service was quick. Will come back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Food quality was excellent. I wish the restaurant was bigger to include the bathroom. The wait time was long but I imagine this is common due to the food quality and friendly staff. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Ok first off I'm not that picky as far as breakfast joints go. But the place was great! Only thing I could say was it's to small and had to wait 15 min to be seated. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"A tiny place to the west of Sunset Station Casino,   off Stephanie Ave. In Henderson, NV.  It is sharing a parking lot with Burlington Coat Factory.

 I really needed a map to find this place as I had passed the area a 100 times and didn't' know it was there ...the building is not facing out onto the road so if you are not looking for it, you will pass it.

At 1:30 p.m. (they close at 2 p.m.) there was one waitress, running around for the other 10 customers....she was sprinting from table to table and finally got to us...I should have lowered the checkered flag, because that's how fast she was running...

  I ordered Loco Moco a scrambled Spam, with Rice and added carrot cake pancakes, my guest ordered banana foster pancakes.

My eggs and rice were ok, they needed something else, because they were so dry, I got a side of Pico de Gallo.  The pancakes were good, not fluffy but not raw, either, so just right.  Cream cheese
 frosting was the syrup.  I could see little carrots in the pancakes.

The Banana Foster Pancakes were very sweet, not my thing, but the guest loved them.  Tasted like a little rum flavoring and lots of sugar and cinnamon were added.

I'm a pumpkin or buckwheat pancake, kinda person and they weren't on the menu.  If you like sweet, gooey pancakes, this is the place...they had some interesting Hawaiian breakfast selections, too.   But I'm looking for the perfect plain, buckwheat or pumpkin pancakes."}
{"text":"Amazing food! There were just 3of us but we upgraded our pancakes (that came with the skillet and omelette orders) and got the Nutella and Bananas Foster pancakes. My daughter got 2 short stacks of Cinnamon roll and White Chocolate Macadamia. I know I know!!! Way too much food for 3people so no need to judge me. The bananas foster was the favorite. The omelette and skillet were great too with nice portions. I am happily full and done eating for the day!"}
{"text":"Just a real down home experience. Christopher is superb at waiting tables, great attitude, and really helpful. They didn't have the exact menu item I was looking for, so they improvised. How many places will do that for you? It was excellent. There are many items on their menu I would like to try, so this will be my go-to place for a while. Thanks Christopher."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places to go to most of the time! Their popular red velvet pancakes & the lemon ricotta crepe pancakes are amazing! The huevos rancheros with seasoned potatoes is one of my favorites. Their skillets & omelettes are good too!"}
{"text":"The management this place is the nightmare. Hostess look like a zombie and couldn't even speak up and the counter Asian girl totally RUDE and look like a dumb dyke. food is not that great and French fries look like took them from the freezer. We were waiting for an hour and finally got a seat closer to the waiting lobby. This place only have 10 table may be less. I don't understand you wait for one hour and get crappy service and OK food. I tried the Crack Egg down the street and much better service and less time waiting."}
{"text":"I cannot convey in words just how delicious these damn pancakes are.

My boyfriend is not a pancake person.  He doesn't enjoy food like I do, and pancakes are pretty much at the bottom of his breakfast/brunch list. He always finishes these pancakes.  

This breakfast place works great for a California- Hawaii couple like us.  They have an awesome selection of Hawaii \"comfort foods\" like corned beef hash, Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, loco moco, etc.  But, they also have awesome Southwest/Cali/Mex breakfast foods like huevos rancheros.

Favorites:
- Red Velvet pancakes are a MUST try.  They're light, delicately chocolately, and covered with REAL whipped cream- which really makes the dish superb. Pancakes are a normal size, not hujangez like Hash House a Go Go, and are slightly crispy on the outside, and warm and spongy on the inside.

- Bananas Foster pancakes:  YES... quite decadent for breakfast, but definitely worth the calories... no wait... I don't want to know how many calories there are in this... Again, the whipped cream really ties the dish together... along with fresh bananas foster.... warm and caramelly. Next time, we'll try the French toast.

- Adobo Fried Rice:  My favorite [non pancake] item on the menu so far.  Pork adobo is cooked to perfection, and combines well with the rice in a savory- slightly tangy (from adobo vinegar).  Next time, I may ask for the rice with the egg done over easy.  I enjoyed the fried egg wrap, but I think it may taste better with an egg yolk cracked over the rice.

- Kalua Pig Benedict:  Awesome... although, I've done this myself at home with some leftover kalua pig, English muffins, and eggs.  Their hollandaise sauce was definitely better, though.

- Loco Moco with garlic fried rice:  Pretty typical.  I would recommend adding the garlic fried rice for an extra kick, though.  Traditional brown gravy, and well prepared hamburger patty made it feel like home.  Gravy was a bit saltier than usual though.

*TIP: Go on a weekday if you can.  Weekends are just nuts.  The boyfriend and I both work from home, so we've been going on Tuesday or Wednesday mornings and usually have no wait for a table."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this gem of a place and it was outstanding.  The food and the wait staff were great.  I had the chili loco moco with Portuguese sausage and it was excellent.  The others at my table had the kalua pork with eggs, and we had the Nutella pancake.  All very good.  We don't live in Las Vegas but will make sure that we go back Babystacks on our next trip back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant my only issue is the whole party has to be present in order to put ur name on the list other than that the food is amazing."}
{"text":"So disappointed for the second time.   I ordered and omelet.  Eggs were overcooked, the avocado was not ripe, hash brown were cold.  My husband had bacon pancakes which were greasy.  The bacon was as hard as a rock.  We will not be returning.  The 2 stars are for the coffee refills."}
{"text":"Our fav breakfast place-always worth the wait! German chocolate pancakes are dreamy/delicious/amazing!  Very moist and melts in your mouth. My man enjoys the loco moco and I also enjoy the spam eggs on garlic fried rice. They need more locations in Henderson or a larger restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice. And the place was packed.
The a/c was super cold which for me is not so good but not enough to make me leave.

We wère seated at a small booth by the window.
Unfortunately the window has not been wiped down in quite some time and the ledge was covered in dust and dead bugs.

I still didn't leave. I ordered the baby chicks skillet.
I was not please with it. It lacked any significant flavor especially on the potatos. 

My hubs ordered mexican omelette. He said it was delicious. Additionally he had the strawberry lemonade and that was delicious too.

Even though my experience wasn't the best, it wasnt bad enough to make me not ever go again. I will look to see if the window ledge has been wiped down because that will probably make me leave for cleanliness reasons."}
{"text":"If you are meeting friends or family you will need the whole party there before seating. So one * taken. Popular place and always packed. Food is always delicious and if you're a pancake person you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint! Red Velvet Pancakes topped with whipped cream, chocolate chips and drizzled with cream cheese syrup, Yummylicious! 

My Favorites:
Rick's Adobo Rice
Red Velvet Pancakes"}
{"text":"Fir a first timer, I had high expectations because of the reviews from my friends. The place was kind of dirty for being so new. There was dry food on the top of the salt shaker. The food was just OK! Honesty, I prefer IHOP.
The service was lacking, the noise levels were out of control,"}
{"text":"Overall a decent go to place for breakfast in Henderson. Face it, Henderson isn't one of the foodie Mecca's in Vegas. But as far as breakfast and what you get for your money it's decent.

This particular location is busy but not as packed as the other locations. You can usually walk in and be sat most weekdays and a short wait on weekends.

Service here is ok. I think once a section is seated all at once the service tends to diminish but overall decent service from decent people. There have been plenty of occasions where we were never brought items we ordered or drinks filled so be prepared.

Food wise it's a step above the chains in the area. There are some other local spots in Henderson that have an elevated menu but this isn't bad.

Pancakes are most time light and fluffy. The lemon ricotta pancakes are our favorites. Make sure to eat them as soon as you get them. Once cooled off these thin, moist decadent cakes tend to be tough. 5/5 for the ricotta pancakes.

We've tried the omelette. Nothing special. Both times the omelette has been a bit dry and not fluffy, flat actually. 2/5 here.

Biscuits and gravy tho... definitely recommend those. Hardy thick country style gravy. Add the bacon for a real treat. 4/5 for those.

Like I said, overall a step above ihop. Not a bad price point either. Expect to pay around $30 for 2 people."}
{"text":"Had the red velvet pancakes.  The butter and frosting is really all you need.  It was so sweet that I didn't even touch the syrup.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy and were dusted with some chocolate powder.  It's like a cupcake and pancake combined!  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has been down the road from my house for this long and I've been going to IHOP! This place is amazing. Best pancakes ever! I also had an omelette and eggs Benedict - both great!"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times. First time I walked out because my girlfriend and I waited almost an hour just for drinks! 2nd time we left due to the rude employees and the insane wait time of an hour and a half as we were told. 3rd time we left because we were. Never even acknowledged but the host at the front door. So after walking up twice, obviously too wrapped up in his conversation with another employee about nothing work related we left. As we walked away he thanked us and said please come back, like we had a pleasant dining experience.

Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Family came to get breakfast and everything was great. Food was on point as always. Service was great. Only a ten minute wait to sit. Food came out all together and still hot. They were constantly checking up on us making sure our coffee was topped off."}
{"text":"Love this place and their adobo fried rice!!! and the red velvet pan CAKES???? WOW laulau  must try!"}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS AMAZING 
Reason not to go here: The hostesses are horrible. Their policies are not customer oriented. They only accept what is convenient to them. I walked in with my newborn, and a friend. It was super hot and I guess their air conditioner was/is broken. They refused to sit us until my other friend arrived (she was across the street getting gas. 
They refused to split checks (oh god, the extra work might be too much) 
And wait till you read this!!
The hostesses won't sit you without a full party, and they won't split checks BUT THEY WANT TIPS. 
They have a TIP JAR for the girls that do nothing but STAND THERE AND TAKE MONEY 

How disgusting honestly. If you want tips, work for it."}
{"text":"Food was good. I got to try a few on their menu. I'm usually not a pancake guy but I like the pancakes here. The prices for the food is really good. The only downside is they don't split checks."}
{"text":"Although I have only ordered take out from baby stacks, the food has always been good. I really enjoy the Portuguese sausage, rice, & eggs. The service is always good, and the food is prepared in a timely manner. The only negative is that both times, the toast has tasted a little stale, but toast is so minor compared to the rest of the food. I do plan to dine in for breakfast very soon."}
{"text":"This place stays busy, but they get you in and out fast! I had to try their famous red velvet pancakes. They were all that and more! My friend ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, she enjoyed them.  According to her they taste like girl scout cookies.  The service is great and the food is delicious.  Since they're do busy be prepared to wait up to 30 mins bit that's not long and it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place in Vegas! Small, more intimate setting than the usual spots but still hits the spot. We usually have a decent experience eating here. 

It sucks not being able to give this place 5 stars because their pancakes are really 5 stars. Red Velvet, Cookies & Cream, s'mores, all of the ones we've tried are amazing. But their cakes are always better than their actual breakfast main entrees. 

I really shouldn't be eating all this stuff anyways but HEY, who cares lol. 

I'm docking them 2 stars for 2 reasons. 

1) 11/19/16-The corn beef hash had no flavor. And neither did the adobo fried rice when my cousin ordered it 2 weeks ago. 

2) 11/19/16-They only have one register. The cashier decided to take a to-go order and instead of writing it down then putting it in, she took up the register which created a line to pay while the person ordering on the phone took forever. Pretty inconvenient.

There are a lot of other spots in Vegas with great cakes. Doesn't have to be this one."}
{"text":"Was in town and decided to introduce my sister, bro in law, niece & nephew to Babystacks Cafe! We went Friday morning around 9am and there was no line! We were seated right away and I couldn't decide on what I wanted to try this time.

Decided to go with the Corn beef/hash with the upgrade on the pancakes and the rice (garlic). The corn beef hash was nothing special. It was good though. I had some of my sisters Adobo Fried rice and it was good! Its adobo fried rice that is in an omelette. I'm getting that next time. Still a fan of BabyStacks!"}
{"text":"So good!!! I love the variety of pancakes they offer. I had the bananas foster pancake & it was amazing! I also had the mexican potato scramble & it was equally good! This is my go-to breakfast place for sure! I've never seen that many different pancakes you could order in one restaurant!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Gerardo was awesome! No complaints with the staff, all friendly. The place seems to be well kept. 
The food was ok. No issues with the temp or anything, this is a place to go for \"quantity vs. quality\"!! 
The eggs, bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs were very bland. Pancakes were pretty good. 
Again, Gerardo was very helpful and nice. Gave 5 stars for him and everything else. 
Prob won't go back."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for pancakes I had the cookies and cream ones and they were the best I had in my life. They are only open until 2 Monday thru Friday and we didn't know they closed while we were eating but they were still really nice about. I will be back many more times"}
{"text":"My fiancé & I can't ever visit Vegas without eating at Babystacks. Our absolute favorite place. The food is kind-blowing every time. What I had was exceptional today - the salsa & pico de gallo were delicious & fresh & the whipped cream on top of my pancakes was so fluffy! Bring Babystacks to Phoenix, please!"}
{"text":"The pancakes were out of this world (Red velvet and Cinnabon) I highly recommend this place. Wish there was a location closer to my house."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes = absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"This place was lots of Hawaii dishes on the menu and is run by folks from Hawaii. I had the portuguese sausage fried rice with three eggs breakfast, totally awesome with a side of pancakes."}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal breakfast-lunch place and so far it's my faovurite such pplace in Las Vegas.  Everything we have had here is outstanding except for the corned-beef hash which is the basic traditional kind that tastes like the canned kind.  I know people who love that, but I don't.  Even that, though, is good if doctored up with ketchup and hot sauce.

Anyway, all the pancakes we've had are incredible, including the red velvet and the banana cream pie.  Neither is too sweet or heavy, as one might reasonably fear, and they are light and beautifully prepared.  The lemon ricotta crepes are also great.

The Kalua Pig Benedict is different and delicious.

Hash browns are great, cooked nicely."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast. Service was fast and attentive. I would have given it 5 stars but we had a seat directly behind the patio door. So close that the door blocks you in your seat when it's open. There was a near constant stream of people in and out, and a hefty whoosh of cold air along with it. Breakfast was colder quicker than it needed to be, and the cool breeze in the morning became pretty annoying by the time we left. 

The pancakes were delicious and tasted like pancakes should. It was obvious they were freshly made. The breakfast scramble I had included \"crispy bacon\" according the menu - and it was! I wondered if it would really be crispy when I ordered and was happy to see it was. The avocado on my breakfast was ripe, the potatoes crispy and the egg cooked just as I ordered it.

Coffee and drinks were promptly filled and tasted freshly made.

It was a little on the noisy side, with so many people in a fairly small space.

We'll be sure and visit again - and sit in a different spot next time."}
{"text":"This is THE SPOT! Id been looking for a breakfast diner to for my family, something everyone would enjoy and BOY, let me tell you everyone cleaned and would have licked their plates the food was soo delicious. I was so happy and enjoyed every bite. The eggs were cooked to perfection. The portions are perfect, the pancakes are to die for. You will have to get there early or just know you will have to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will not regret it. Aside from that the service was very friendly. I will definitely be back over and over again. I plan to try everything on the menu. MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and we sat right down at a table.  I agree with everyone else that the pancakes are very good, but my daughter was the only smart one.  She ordered Banana Nut pancakes, yum!! I ordered the sausage and eggs and I wasn't impressed.  I asked for over medium eggs and I got less than over easy eggs.  I'm kind of wondering if they were cooked at all.  They didn't have much flavor either and they just ended up being a soupy mess on my plate.  My husband ordered the Kahuna Pig eggs benedict and was not impressed either.  I'm dissappointed as I had high hopes for this place. If you want just pancakes, this place is probably the best, but everything else we tried was no good! Back to Jamm's we go."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service. The food here really is delicious and the prices are unquestionable, but as  someone that works in Food & Beverage we know that SERVICE IS #1. My mother came in an hour before they closed and they Absolutely had no wait and she needed a table for 2, yet they wouldn't seat her until I have arrive. She mentioned she was even ready to order, but they still made her wait with empty tables in the dining room.  How are you going to make an elder women wait and not let her sit and ORDER?! Party of 1 or 2 she will still be sat at a table for two anyways?!  RIDICULOUS. I even called the manage and said she's ready to order can you please seat and her they said they'll \"TRY\" to work something out.  I arrive and no one has even spoke to my mother. Not only did the manger lie to me on the phone, but they won't even seat a guest with empty tables in the dining room. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Spoke with 2 people who work here, this afternoon. They have No gluten free options and no plans to add any! Definitely upsetting. My family and I were very excited that they opened in our neighborhood, but we will not be able to eat here."}
{"text":"Food:

The pancakes are absolutely delicious. The rest of the food gives anyone a homely environment, but it is like any other breakfast joint with a little more variety and substitutions available.

Come here for the variety of pancakes, but the eggs, bacon, sausage, spam, etc. are just plain \"regular.\"

Cost:

Without a Groupon, I can't imagine spending $30 plus tip here for two people for breakfast."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the Henderson/Las Vegas area. Prices are better than reasonable and the service and wait staff are excellent. Menu includes many different variations of pancakes as well as great Filipino dishes that remind me of the homeland."}
{"text":"So a new foodie friend I made upon recently moving to Las Vegas texted me on Saturday to ask if I was interested in getting up at the crack of dawn on Sunday to go eat breakfast at 730 a half hour across town.  My initial thought was insanity and my second was whether or not anyone in town other than some compulsive gamblers needing a hangover meal would actually be there.  But then I heard three words that I didn't think was possible to string together in one phrase: Red...Velvet...pan-Cakes.   Having grown up in the south, folks take their red velvet cake pretty seriously, so I had to at least make the trip for a taste.

When I arrived, not only was my friend there 10 minutes early, but the entire place was already packed, so I knew I was walking into some serious eats.  As multiple orders of the infamous pancakes were ordered at our table, I began to think of that sketch where Bill Cosby talks about feeding his children chocolate cake for breakfast only to incur the wrath of his wife.   Perhaps these pancakes would have salvaged Bill from the doghouse.  If you ignore the sinfully red color of the pancakes, the chocolate chips are disguised as blueberries, the whipped cream as butter, and the sneakiest of all is the cream cheese syrup as the maple syrup....pure genius.  Assemble the components together and you get the perfect bite of warm red velvet cake with some additional bonus textures of the slightest crunch and chew from the edge of the pancake and the chocolate chips respectively.   

This dish offers irrefutable proof one CAN have their cake and eat it too."}
{"text":"Service is horrible! 

We came in and waited patiently to be seated and another party of four walk in and they seat them right away. I say something to the person who sat them and he said I didn't know you guys were waiting. My response was I just randomly sit in a restaurant not trying to eat. And he said well I can't ask them to get up since I already sat them. 

But we were just super hungry so they sat us at the bar. Our waitress took our order and then we waited for 45 mins before some of our food came. 

My friend ordered steak and eggs and my husband ordered country fried steak and my other friend ordered red velvet pancakes. All of which came out before my salad did. When our waitress brought out their food she said the salad was going to be right out. Fifteen mins later my salad still didn't come out. So I asked our waitress what happened to my salad. And her answer was I don't know the kitchen is all confused back there. 

So I told her if it's not coming out now cancel it I'll just eat somewhere else because everyone else I am with are basically done eating. 

When we got our bill you figure she would have discounted something for the issue but nothing. Then when I went to pay in front and the guy asked me how everything was she still didn't say anything. 

The food was okay nothing amazing but I don't think I will be coming back! Horrible was terrible"}
{"text":"This place is obviously busy because of their pancakes; however, I ordered their biscuits and gravy because I'm not a huge pancake fan, and after having done so, I was less than impressed. I think I even made the fork bend when I tried to cut into one of the biscuits. As well, the flavor of the gravy was awful. Honestly, this place seriously needs to reinvent their biscuits and gray recipe! #bummed"}
{"text":"Thanks to Lolo Rick
For his adobo fried rice
In an omelette.

Wasn't too salty
Or over marinated.
Really good flavor.

I ate that orange
And all of the potatoes
Which were seasoned well.

The pancakes are bad -
For my diet but yolo.
White chocolate chip

Macadamia
Nut pancakes were stupid good.
Yeah, we will be back."}
{"text":"Chicken Adobo fried rice = sounds alot better on the menu, but it tasted kind of bland :(

Red velvet pancakes = odd... tasted like a slice of cake in a pancake. I personally liked the plain pancakes better but I guess if you want a slice of cake in your pancake OK.. Depends on your expectations haha 

All in all decent, not sure I would go out of my way to come here again though"}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here by a previous local. Loved that I listened to her!
Babystacks has a huge menu with tons of pancake flavors and Filipino/Hawaiian/island inspired dishes. 
During this visit we tried the red velvet pancakes, the corned beef and garlic rice, and the Portuguese sausage and garlic rice. 
Everything was delicious! I could've eaten a whole bowl of the whipped cream that came on the pancakes! I only wish the portions were a bit bigger on the non-pancake items. 
I will definitely come back and try something else, maybe the loco moco and the lemon ricotta pancakes!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved coming to this place for breakfast. But today, I was very upset with the girl at the front. Our server was very good, and he kept making sure my friend and I were ok. But today when we tried to pay, I asked the girl if she can split the check. I know they don't split the bill, but rather, they split the price. The girl working (w/ an attitude) told me to tell her the price. When I couldn't figure it out, she told me \"there's a calculator.\" I was very frustrating to know that I had to do her job while she literally stood in front and just waited."}
{"text":"Pancakes were yummy. Only thing was that we were the third table occupied and the lady sat us down and the guy with his bright hair and wonderful eye makeup took our order. Got our eggs and bacon with potatoes and waited and waited and waited, finally got our pancakes and coffee refill. Guess next time we will go to the one in Summerlin."}
{"text":"If I could only give this place more than 5 stars. I still remember trying out this place 5 years ago the one in Summerland. We now come to this location every time we come to Vegas. It is our go to breakfast place. We come the first day in Vegas and right before we leave. There is nothing like babystacks in Cali. So now you know why we always come. Not only do  We bring family and friends, but tell the others to come when in vegas and the are always make sure to stop by when in vegas. Not only is the food amazing but the service is great. All the staff is super nice and attentive. Today we had Amanda as our server. She was great super friendly! The food: OMG AMAZING. The pancakes are bomb love the flavors and choices. The mocha chocolate chip bomb glad its on the full menu, red velvet bomb, carrot cake bomb, peanut butter and jelly bomb, cookies and cream bomb lets just say all of them are BOMB haven't had any that were not. the omelettes: the Mexican is the best as well as the cowboy. Who would have thought to put carnitas in an omelet? Babystacks that's who. If you haven't been here STOP BY! trust me won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The only place we eat breakfast! They have great food, service and a great atmosphere. It's not very big, but that's what makes it great. Especially on the weekends, you need to get there early or you'll have to wait. We typically try to arrive before 8am. Usually by 8:30am the wait list starts. Anytime we have out of town guests, we always bring them here. They are known for their awesome pancakes so make sure you order some! Banana Foster is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Wow after trying the well known red velvet pancakes here I can officially die a happy woman. I am not normally a sweet tooth kind of gal but holy moly these pancakes had me at first bite! They were so so yummy. They were moist and perfectly sweetened. You didn't even have to use the cheese cake frosting on the side.We also tried the Oreo pancakes they were also very delicious and moist but the red velvet is where its at.

Now the normal breakfast omelettes, eggs, skillets, bacon, sausage, etc. is your typically breakfast nothing too special. I got the scrambled eggs and the corned beef hash. The eggs were good, could have made similar at home but the corned beef hash was wayyyy to salty. I took a few bites and then couldn't finish them, yuck.

This place is well worth it if your coming for pancakes but be prepared for a wait. Oh and they won't seat you unless your full party is there. I will come back!"}
{"text":"The best. You must get the red velvet pancakes they are so good!!!! I could eat this all day!!!"}
{"text":"Great food here! Both breakfast and a nice variety of options other than breakfast. The pancakes of so many flavors are must try's! Their all so great! Very busy place , had a 25 min wait but with all the hype I had to wait. It was well worth it. The food and came out quick and was fresh ad great. Only bad thing about this whole Experience is that the service was not that great at all. Server greeted us took out order and than dropped off drinks and food were the only times she was at our table really. Noticed there was only two servers on the floor at the time I was there. Other than that everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is place is great!! Food is delish! Service is excellent, even though they are extremely busy. I love bringing the family here for breakfast. I would recommend it to anyone. The only bad thing is the wait, but that it to be expected."}
{"text":"I am willing to give this place another try.  With my first visit here i am still unsure.  I ended up getting the country bene with the addition spam and the gravy on the side and an order of the mac salad.  The eggs where poached nicely which is hard to find a good place to cook them right.  The sausages patties where pretty flavor full along with the biscuit that they place it on.  I am glad i asked for the gravy on the side since that needed some flavor same goes for the mac salad.  Needed some more acid in the mayo mixture.  Overall it was a decent meal for the price.  I was shocked that it was cash only with a little sign tapped to the counter near the register, Good thing i had cash on me.  Service was good food was hot.  Like i said before i will give this place another try maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"They made up for the last mishap. We were seated immediately and waited on right away. The food came out quit and I must say it was worth the wait. You absolutely have to get the garlic rice with onions Yummmm x2 . I got the baby stacks PB and ?? ...this was an excellent meal for sure."}
{"text":"If you're awake for breakfast, brunch, or lunch, I highly recommend this place! They have a wonderful huge selection on their menu, including island type breakfast selections! (Ex. Portuguese sausage, corned beef, loco moco!) They even have an immense variety of special pancakes such a red velvet, cookies and cream, banana's foster, etc! 

I come here with my brother and we like to get an entree order and substitute regular pancakes or potatoes with their special pancakes. If you're like me and some other out there that get rice with their meal, they have an option to sub regular white rice for Garlic rice! Such a good switch!

Overall delicious food, fast seating wait times, food comes out at a normal wait time, simple and sweet decor, nice island music feels to get your morning going, and well priced! Try it out :)"}
{"text":"This place is only 5 miles from the strip and luckily we rented a car for the weekend. I had the breakfast burrito with spinach instead of meat and it was very good. Nothing too amazing, but good! (the 4 stars are also a result of the lack of interest our waitress showed in our meals and questions) The reason I'm really writing is to tell the world that everyone needs to add red velvet pancakes to their bucket list! Don't trust other bad reviews. They are by NO means too sweet! Infact they are very mind...perfect id say! The cream cheese sauce even comes on the sie so u can add to your liking!"}
{"text":"Thanks to babystacks I've found the reason behind American obesity. 

AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE."}
{"text":"Delicious pancakes! The eggs and potatoes are ok but the pancakes are to die for. The red velvet and orange dreamsicle are amazing. The banyan cream pie was good but not as tasty."}
{"text":"I give two thumbs up to their adobo fried rice and red velvet pancakes. The adobo fried rice has some shredded chicken marinated in a soy sauce base. My mom makes a way better chicken adobo but wrapping the fried rice like an omelet is unexpected and it works. The red velvet pancakes are yummy and I really dig the cream cheese sauce. The loco moco has really good gravy. The service is friendly but not consistently attentive as what I'd expect in a breakfast place. As long as the food is consistent, I will return. Overall, good cheap eats."}
{"text":"Oh man!  What can I say.  We love this place.  It's or favorite breakfast spot of all time.  The wait is always worth it on the weekends.  I'm by all means not a pancake guy but I order their pancakes every time I go with a skillet. We haven't had 1 bad experience."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. Never disappoints, came from spring valley location and so glad they opened one here. Definitely seams to be understaffed because I never have just 1 waiter and it takes long just to take an order."}
{"text":"Referred by a friend and can't seam to stay away since, love everything!! The menu the prices the food. It's always my go-to for breakfast,"}
{"text":"My visit to BabyStacks was the first time I tried red velvet pancakes and cream cheese icing.  I have tried red velvet pancakes a many times at other places since visiting BabyStacks and I can unequivocally say that no one does it better than BabyStacks.  I've also yet to see anyone else do the cream cheese icing that pairs so wonderfully with the red velvet pancakes.  

The restaurant fills up quickly so you'll probably end up having to wait a for a table.  Luckily, getting a table for two only took about 10 minutes on a busy weekend.  I can't wait to come back and get my red velvet pancake fix."}
{"text":"I always try and eat breakfast at Baby Stacks every single time I visit Vegas.  

I can't help but order a side of red velvet pancakes even though the meal itself is enough food.  Those darn pancakes are amazing!  The cream cheese icing/syrup is so good that it makes me want to punch someone in the face.  

The corned beef hash and the adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelet are excellent choices.  

The wait can be long if you come on the weekend during peak hours, so keep that in mind when visiting."}
{"text":"First time at this little place! I am a pancake junky and when I saw they had a bunch of different dessert hot cakes I had to come check it out! I had the s'mores pancakes and they were excellent! I normally like big bigger pancakes but these were just right! Also built my own omelette which comes with a choice of side. I chose the garlic fried rice which was awesome! Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Found this place while looking on yelp for breakfast joints selling Portuguese sausage. It does not look like much on the outside and there is limited seating inside. We waited roughly an hour to be seated. It was well worth the wait. The pancakes are delsih!!! I tried the banana fosters which they don't have on the menu, you have to ask for it and it was amazing. The Portuguese sausage wasn't the same brand that everybody in Hawaii uses but it did its purpose and made my tummy smile. Prices were very reasonable and I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place in Vegas. Mexican skillet is fantastic. Pancakes are on point. Also they make some great coffee. Sometimes on the weekend the service is lacking but the food more then makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here but my first time to check in I believe. Today I got the adobo omelette and it was sooo good! I would definitely go back to this place not just for their pancakes but for that as well. 

I really like that they do give you the option if you would like to upgrade your pancakes to something that aren't even ordinary breakfast pancakes ! They are very interesting pancakes and very good! I would definitely go back especially for their red velvet pancakes !"}
{"text":"This place is always a must for breakfast when I visit Vegas! The Red Velvet Pancakes are unbeatable! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh gosh, I come here twice a month on a regular basis, of course I am giving this place a 5 star rating! I love the Hawaiian touch it is has! I love the Kahlua pig Benedict! They also have Portuguese sausage (linguica) so eat here Brazilian and Portuguese people! 

Don't get me started on their specialty pancakes! I like to try a new one each time I go. I have tried the red velvet, lemon ricotta, banana foster, and banana cream pie so far. I like them all! If you are looking for something less sweet, I would recommend the banana cream pie and the lemon ricotta pancakes. 

Enjoy! ( I sure do)"}
{"text":"A great little breakfast spot away from everything.. They have so many different pancakes to choose from. The service was on point and the staff was helpful and friendly. I will definitely be back to try the banana fosters pancakes and the garlic fried rice when visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Skillet breakfast w/ pancakes - both were exceptionally ho-hum.  Service was noteworthy: it was worse than the meal.  I'll stay home next time (my pancakes are world class) or go back to the best breakfast joint in town - The Original Sunrise Cafe."}
{"text":"Can't ever go wrong here guys!  If you want to feel like you're in Maui eating breakfast go here!  Same great food and service!"}
{"text":"This place is too cute! The interior is so fresh and colorful. It's always filled with people, yet the wait is NEVER very long. The prices are reasonable & the Hawaiian spin on American breakfast is really good- I recommend either the spam & eggs or the red velvet pancakes. Aside from the food, their coffee is the best. I could come here solely to drink it; every time I eat here, I drink at least 3-4 cups! It's pretty easy to do considering that the servers are constantly asking to refill your cup. They are very attentive (definitely deserving of a good tip). Overall, this place is pretty much a perfect way to start out your day."}
{"text":"I love baby stacks just because of their red velvet pancakes. Hahaha I only go their just for that but overall experience was great! It's always pack of people! I would definitely wait and stay in line just cause of the red velvet pancakes hahaha"}
{"text":"Finally tried baby stack. They are crazy busy on the weekend but it seems like they are not that bad on weekdays.
Ordered adobo fried rice in an omelette and it was ok, the adobo was really salty and I feel it's missing something for it to be amazing. I've ordered the pancake on the side and I got the red velvet pancake and that was good, really fluffy and I like the whipped cream on top and the cream cheese syrup. 
My fiancé ordered the loco moco with the potato on the side and he said it's better than the real thing in Hawaii  and the potatoes were cooked perfect. Idk how that's possible, but he became a fan of loco moco now lol.
The waitress gave us good service too and the price is decent. I'd come back to try more of their food."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this place! As soon as I walked inside I was greeted with a happy face and that happy theme followed thru out my meal. I ordered the Huntington omlete with a upgraded side of the beloved red velvet pancakes. Simply divine :-) 

The place has a strong Hawaiian theme and feeling, from the decor, music and most important the food :-) I felt relaxed and laid back, very Hawaiian style. Our waitress even told us to buy the Groupon deal before we paid our bill. Who does that?? Seriously that was awesome and we saved a bunch of money! This is now my new breakfast spot :-) Next on my list is to try the banana cream pancakes :-)"}
{"text":"They do a solid breakfast and by the looks of the long line, they are obviously doing something right; however, I've been able to recreate the dishes I like here in the comfort of my own home without the hassle of waiting around. This is a good option to take out of town guests to since they have a lot of Hawaiian breakfast plates and sweet pancake/dessert options, but I don't want to waste my weekends in line here. The staff does their best to accommodate everyone, but they easily fall behind tasks (providing checks, refilling drinks, condiment requests, etc) since there is so much going on. They also have their location on N Buffalo, so make sure to clarify the location you are meeting people at. You can call ahead for the wait time, but that can change at any moment. Will only come back if I'm feeling lazy."}
{"text":"Each time I'm visiting Vegas, I always stop by BabyStacks! It's one of my favorite breakfast spots here. Inside it's homey with a family feel, and service is always great. I usually have to wait a bit each time I visit though, at most half an hour. 

The red velvet pancakes are the best I've ever had- nothing else comes close! It's not super sweet, and there are chocolate chips in the pancake itself, and the cream cheese drizzled on top isn't sweet either. They're perfectly moist as well.

If you're hungry, the chicken adobo fired rice wrapped in an egg is also bomb too. It's pretty heavy though, so you may go into a food coma afterwards haha. 

Last time I was here I got the steak and eggs, opting for the garlic fried rice. Just a forewarning- they don't go easy on the garlic here! It was satisfying until the last bite.

I'll be seeing you guys on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Baby Cakes is a far drive from the strip and the place is small, but it is worth it for the food. I had to try the red velvet pancakes that everyone is talking about.  Wow they are great!

I also got to try some of the other items that were on the menu: 

Hash browns crispy and thin 9/10
HM1 Tasty 8/10
Kalua Pig Benedict pork was tender and moist 8/10
Ricks adobo fried rice came rapped up in an egg omelet 7/10
Macaroni salad 5/10
Red Velvet pancakes 9/10 (made a great snack before dinner)

If this place were in my hood, I would go all the time."}
{"text":"I was here today for the first time, very cute place a little small but that's ok, the food was really good, food Came out very quickly, reasonably priced.  We will def be returning."}
{"text":"I had the chicken adobo fried rice omelette and it was delicious! The meat was so flavorful I didn't have to add anything to it. The staff was friendly and their prices are reasonable. I definitely recommend eating here and I will be coming back :-)"}
{"text":"Food is good but being forced to watch UFC fights while having breakfast is an inappropriate appetite suppressant.

Lots of factors go into creating appropriate ambiance at a restaurant. 

Here at Babystacks, management has given ZERO THOUGHT to some of the little things that matter a lot ... to customers."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST PLACE IN TOWN!! 
Great service and great food! Wish their restaurants were just a bit bigger in size.  They would still make a killing!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by this place! Staff was incredibly friendly and made great recommendations. The food was great, highly recommend the kalua pork benedict! Definitely going to make this place one of my regulars!"}
{"text":"We were in such a hurry and the wait was over an hour long, so we all got our food to-go. 

I got Nutella crepes with strawberries. I received no strawberries. The crepes tasted undercooked and soagy. Our food was left for a while because they were extremely busy so our food was ready and got cold for sitting. 

I heard good things about this restaurant. I wish I had the time to sit and enjoy my meal freshly. I will try BabyCakes again."}
{"text":"After browsing through the yelp reviews we decided to get the most popular: Ricks adobo fried rice and the kalua pork eggs benedict. Also got a short stack of banana creme pancakes. 

Best choice was the pancakes! Omgahh. The banana cream on those things was heavenly. It was just like eating a piece of pie and they fluffiness of the pancakes really balanced it well. Overall it was not too sweet which made it easy to keep eating. They also give you a heaping amount of whip cream.

The other two dishes were kinda meh. Im not a huge fan of egg things so thats my fault really. The adobo fried rice was good on its own but the egg it was wrapped in had no seasoning or flavor so I had to pick it apart. The eggs benedict were not poached very well and was a bit overdone and the huge glob of hollandaise sauce on top made me stop after like two bites. 

Overall if youre going to come here stick to the pancakes. They are heavenly. Next time I think ill try the red velvet pancakes everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"The Red velvet pancakes are really good.  
The Peanut butter was kinda plain and not enough peanut butter.
Cinnamon roll pancake was not too sweet

Corn Beef and hash was good.

Overall, this place is yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit out of the way if you're staying on the strip, but we stopped by here for Sunday brunch before we left for LA. The wait was about 30-45 minutes so is suggest coming early to beat the rush.

We ordered the red velvet pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes, the lemon one, strawberry, and the hazelnut French toast (I came here a month ago so I forgot the names)

Everything was really good but my favorite was the French toast. It was amazing!

I also recommend the garlic fried rice with some tapatio."}
{"text":"Easy to see why this place is a 4 cafe. It was easy to see that this is the place locals come for breakfast. 
First thing is the choices for breakfast, lots and lots of choices. Mexician breakfasts ever pancake you can imagine and eggs, potatoes, rice, any way you want it. 

I had the Huevos Ranchos with the green sauce. Very good. 

My wife had the Cinnabon pancakes. Said they were good and cleaned the plate. 

My daughter had the Mexican skillet. Shredded pork, potatoes and cheese. 2 eggs and toast. She said the pork was perfect and finished every bit. 

The server was very attentive and wanted to insure a good meal. 

If the truck stop is full of trucks....it has to be good. If the local cafe is filled with locals, the same applies. 

Looking for a great meal, with a fair price, here it is."}
{"text":"So this is not the place to go if you are counting carbs because even if you resolve to be strong, the gorgeous plates going by will make you feel deprived. I would suggest diving into the experience, this place makes the fall worth it. The waitress was very patient with us, it was a difficult decision!   I had the red velvet pancakes as a dessert with my turkey club sandwich.  The sandwich was really good, the avocado was just right, lettuce crispy, all was yummy...BUT THE PANCAKES should have a soundtrack of angels singing.  First the color was an amazing red on the edges and the portion was just right.  They were served with fresh whipped cream on top and a cream-cheesy-butter-syrup to dip or pour over them.  I dipped and dipped again.  I will definitely return to BabyStacks."}
{"text":"Dude the corned beef hash is bomb af. I got it with rice and wheat toast, even the toast is goooooood. They do corned beef right :) my stomach is fat and happy"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas. Carrot cake pancakes and the green salsa omlett every time. My boyfriend gets the banana fosters pancakes and they are insane amazing(not on menu you have to ask for it). Babystacks is always our first stop when we land. If you are planning on a day of drinking and aimless wandering do yourself a solid and stop here to carb and coffee up and babystacks generous portions will keep you fueled till at least early evening.  love this place"}
{"text":"Our to go to breakfast place. My husband and I along with the family enjoys coming here. Food is reasonable and we love the upgrade on pancakes of our choice. We are from Hawaii and now residing in vegas. I love the local plates they have to offer. Keep up the good work and the staff are excellent. Happy Eats!!"}
{"text":"It's all about the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with several friends, food was delicious but I had pancakes and hard to eat because the plate, maybe like a salad plate size was the size of my pancakes and so when I poured syrup on them, it rolled off onto the table. Yuck, messy!  Others in our party also commented on the small plates. Also, though food tasted good, very tight seating, not a way I want to enjoy the start of my day."}
{"text":"I am a huge breakfast person, and this place delivers on that characteristic of mine. It makes me feel at home for two main reasons: the first being that the only red velvet ANYTHING I have liked is my Mom's cake, until I tried Babystacks' pancakes, and the second being that they play local, Hawaiian music.. and I'm Hawaiian :)

After that initial impression, I kept coming back. I discovered how much I love the rest of their unique pancake flavors and the variety on their menu. They have very traditional breakfast/lunch platters, mixed with some dishes you'd only expect to see in Hawaiian restaurants (like Loco Moco or an Adobo Fried Rice Omelette). Whatever you choose, I hope it lives up to your standards as it has for me. It's affordable, the space is cute and quaint, and the staff is very friendly and attentive with every visit I've had. There is usually a wait time, but never one that is unbearable. If it's ever more than 30 minutes until you can be seated, they'll take down your number and call or text you when there is a table available.

The only downfall is if you don't live in the Summerlin area. That is my only real complaint, if you could really call it that. It's quite a drive for me, but each time I've gone it has been worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I order the skillets with scrambled eggs, delicious.  My 2nd favorite are the nutella crepes, We've found that instead of waiting anywhere from 15-45 mins for a seat, just call ahead and have them make your food for you for pickup.  All three times they've had my food ready within 20 minutes so by the time I got there it was ready.  And it tastes just as good as if you sit in the restaurant and eat."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is exactly what i love in a restaurant! A down home, local, family owned restaurant with \"love\" in every dish! the service was great and the food was amazing. My tip- forget the breakfast regulars and treat yourself to their specialty, the pancakes! my fiance and i got the babystacks as add-ons and unanimously agree we should have just ordered big plates of pancakes! here's the biggest tip i GIFT to other travelers, do not take a taxi here! the cab from the excalibur there didnt take a direct route and ended costing us 26$+tip! we ate breakfast, walked out to the corner and hopped on the bus on flamingo street straight back to the strip for 2$ apiece, and got to sit on the upper level to really take in the sights on the way back. lessons learned for next time! we'll be dreaming about the oreo pancakes for months!"}
{"text":"This location was a disappointment compared to the others I've been to. It took forever to get a waiter/waitress to take our drink order. Then the excuses, we don't have chili, we don't have tomatoes. This is at 9am and you don't have items on your menu? Service was subpar. No aloha spirit. No coming back to this location, I will rather drive 20-30 minutes away for the service and great tasting food in used to from this restaurant chain."}
{"text":"I finally came here with my boyfriend after trying to drag him here for about five months (it's just too out of the way for us). We went on a Tuesday morning and there was still a 40min wait, which sucked because we both get hangry (a hybrid of hungry and angry) fairly quickly. We just sat silently perusing through the menu and smelling the delicious scent of fresh cooked food until they finally called us up.

Since we already went through the menus, we threw in our food orders when the waitress asked for our drinks. We both ordered Spam and eggs with pancake sides. I got the Red Velvet and he got the banana. I believe both of our orders were over $11 because we got specialty pancakes and he upgraded to garlic fried rice. I felt that $8.95 for the Spam and eggs was a little pricey considering we got 3 pieces of Spam each and you could easily get about 10 slices of Spam from a can that's only $2.50. We really wanted a taste of home though, so we both got it. 

I specifically told the waitress I wanted my Spam crispy, but they gave it to me soft and floppy anyway, so I only ended up eating one piece. My boyfriend ate all his Spam, but hardly touched his rice because it wasn't what he expected (it had a lot of thick long strips of onions all over). I guess we're both used to the Filipino style garlic rice we always get at places like Nanay Gloria which just has small pieces of chopped up garlic and that's it. Having both chopped up garlic AND large strips of onions is just a recipe for halitosis. 

On to the pancakes...

My Red Velvet pancakes were nice and moist. Even after piling on all the whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, they weren't too sweet either. They were definitely good, but it was the first time I've ever tried Red Velvet pancakes and I wasn't very blown away. There are a few other places in Vegas that also serve Red Velvet pancakes, so it's not exclusive to BabyStacks. 

My boyfriend thought his Banana pancakes were alright. Rather than adding mashed bananas to the batter, they just put 8 small slices on top of the pancakes and serve it with syrup, so it's actually pretty plain.

I guess I had very high expectations for this place due to all the outstanding reviews, so when I went I was a little disappointed. I mean, it's a good breakfast joint, but not something I'd be willing to wait almost an hour for after making the long commute."}
{"text":"Babystacks is great.  We've been here 5 times and it is consistently good.  Orange dreamsicle pancakes were really good and my kids love the chocolate chip and smores pancakes.  My husband lives the skillet meals.  Service has been excellent,  but come early on the weekends or you'll have a long wait as seating is limited.  Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"I wanna say that this place has the best red velvet pancakes! I couldn't decide between the famous red velvet pancakes and white truffle with macadamia nut pancakes, so I got a small order of both. The white truffle pancakes was good, but red velvet pancakes was so much better!!! 

We also ordered Kailua Pig Eggs Benedict with seasoned potatoes, and I can only say \"Yummy!\" 

We went there on Sunday morning around 9:30, just to avoid the rush hour for brunch, and we got seated within 5 minutes. The waitress was nice and patient. The price was good considering the portion that you get. Definitely worth the 15 minutes driving from strip!"}
{"text":"This place gets four stars for its  simplicity and convenience not to mention the food was pretty good"}
{"text":"Hawaiian/filipino fusion + pancakes. YUM.
HUGE selection of pancake flavors.

Price: Look to spend about $10 per item.

Parking: Lot

Service: Attentive and Awesome!

Food:
The skillet was OK. smaller than I expected.
Rocky Road Pancakes were BOMB. Red Velvet was sweet, so use the cream cheese frosting w caution. I wouldn't get the lemon ricotta ones again.
Adobo rice was like a rice filled omelet. Not bad.

Notes: The vibe of this place is chillllll."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good. I almost like it better than Denny's and ihop! The only problem is they aren't open all the time and it's always packed for breakfast."}
{"text":"Waited to go for a bit, wish I had not waited.  Great breakfast gig in Summerlin North between Lake Mead and Cheyenne on Buffalo.   I hear great things, and its true!   I had the Kalua Pork Eggs Benedict and it was stellar.  I cant wait to go back for the Red Velvet Pancakes.  Waits on weekends can be long, but worth it.   Go during week for best service.  Great place for a breakfast meeting during the week.  Bring a date on weekends.    Highly recommended!   Great food, great price!"}
{"text":"Get on the list and shop for 20 min in the strip mall on sat and Sundays. After 130pm it slows down.   They have a great Hawaiin vibe, with Asian backround, so its so good!   Kalua Pork benedict is to die for, the pancakes are ridiculous and amazing creations.  5 star breakfast, always a wait on weekends!    5 STAR RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"Came from Cali and ate at this place with family and friends. So delicious! So worth the 45 minute wait! The Red Velvet pancakes are insane! My husband ate the Omelette stuffed with the fried rice pork adobo...OMG...so ridiculously good!! Can't wait to come back to this place to try some other stuff on the Menu! Thanks BabyStacks...you are da bomb!"}
{"text":"The wait is long but worth the wait. The red velvet pancake is yummy. My hubby ordered hazelnut pancake and he said it is also yummy. Will come back here again."}
{"text":"Awesome menu!  They have my Hawaiian local favorites like, Portuguese sausage egg and rice and loco-moco.  Aside from that,  they also have red velvet pancakes.  Definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"This spot has been consistently good to me and my family.  Portions are huge. Service always comes with a smile. The locals who come here are so sweet.  Everyone is so nice.  This past week when we last visited, our waiter was excellent. I'm just sorry that I didn't catch his name. Anyway, not only did he make some great suggestions and provide us with great service but he also did a wonderful job at making sure that we had everything that we needed for our daughter to be able to enjoy her dining experience as well.  He bought out extra napkins, a few spoons, water without any ice, etc.  This spot gets pretty full.  I have come in the middle of the week and on weekends.  It has always been busy and there has almost always been a short wait.  The longest that I have waited is about 15 minutes.  The menu is extensive and I'd suggest that you take a peek at it while you are waiting.  The fact that I can always upgrade my pancakes to a speciality one for such a tiny cost, I have beeb meaning to try more and more of them.  This time around I had their strawberry pancake. I know it sounds super basic and I guess you could say that it is but damn was it good!! Our eggs and bacon were cooked to perfection. Everything was so delicious. You can tell it's a real family spot.  Others dining in the restaurant are all so friendly, waving at other people's children and saying hi and what not. My daughter got a bit restless and wanted to take a lap around the restaurant, no problem. She did and waved at almost everyone there if she didn't give them all high fives or fist bumps. What can I say? She's SUPER social!  Anyway, they were all friendly and returned the gesture. Some asked her how old she was, what her name was, etc.  To me, aside from the good food and the great service, having the best customers with awesome attitudes is what makes the restaurant a real gem. See you soon!"}
{"text":"YUM! Super busy place but got in quickly. Extremely friendly people, great service and food. Be sure to try the red velvet pancakes, they're delish! Will definitely be returning as well as recommending to my friends!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and excellent food!! I really like this place for breakfast. You can even get it to go and it's just as good. They have more than one location in Vegas but they all fill up fast so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"So stoked to finally check out Babystacks. I've been waiting for this one to open by my house for like forever. I've been hearing so many good things and they didn't disappoint. I came here on a Saturday for breakfast with my friend Julian and it was packed! We took a seat outside and waiting maybe 15 minutes before we were called in for our table. We sat in a little two seat table by the wall and checked out the menu. I'm a queen of consistency when it comes breakfast. I always order either the chicken fried steak or huevos rancheros for breakfast. Sometime I'll thrown some pancakes in but usually the prior. However, when I came to Babystacks I ordered something completely different. I decided to go with the Mexican Skillet and we split the s'mores pancakes. The Mexican skillet comes with carnitas, jalapenos, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, and sour cream. I also ordered a side of avocado. It was so tasty. The skillet was a great mix of meat and cheese and yum. Only thing I might request next time is less sour cream and maybe some green salsa. I love green salsa. The s'mores pancakes were so sweet, but that is to be expected. They of course come with chocolate chips, marshmallows, whipped cream, and graham crackers crumbs. They barely needed any syrup. I think I ate too much and had a food coma. I went straight home and took a nap. I'm excited to go back and try my normal stuff plus more."}
{"text":"This places has simple but good food. I like eating the Loco mock over garlic rice. Was just in Hawaii couple months ago and tried a couple places and places for Loco moco and still prefer here."}
{"text":"Okay okay, I can feel the backlash already. 

But after all the hype about this place, I'm far from being impressed. But yet again, I'm not one to drive into hype. 

First off, why drive away customers with a sign that exposes a 60 minute wait time when you have a bunch of empty tables waiting to seat hungry patrons? and when we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes (as was everyone else in front of us and behind us), I automatically felt pretty bad at their potential loss of business for those that left because they didn't want to wait \"60 minutes\". I mean cmon now, this isn't Disneyland. Or maybe it is because one of the waiter's were obviously friends with a party that came in and went straight in to be seated. Fast Pass. Nice. But hey, it was only a 25 minute wait, so I can't complain. 

Now on to food. 

Cuz this is what so many of my friends hyped about. 

I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Okay. Folks- save yourselves and just head on over to Aloha Kitchen or Island Flavor. Now they know how to do it right. If you can't make your adobo correctly and expect to throw it into some fried rice and covered with a thin layer of egg- then don't even bother. Learn how to make adobo first- then try and throw it into an \"omelette\". 

Boyfriend had the Loco Moco. Please, don't even get me started. Even him- not being from Hawaii- was highly disappointed. Gravy was bland and so was the hamburger patty. Which meant-- no flavor whatsoever. Cmon folks. Get it together. 

And now...drum roll please...

The pancakes. 

Macadamia Pancakes. 

Tasted like generic, boxed pancake batter. Not mixed correctly with proper measurement of liquids because it was dense beyond belief. Really? Pancake sticking to the roof of your mouth? What the? And I wouldn't even have known it was macadamia nut pancakes if I hadn't read it myself. The white chocolate chips on it was the only other flavor aside from \"batter\" that you can taste. 

RED VELVET PANCAKES:

Strike me now babycake fans. 

Last time I knew-- red velvet pancakes is a touch of cocoa and chocolate. It shouldn't taste like CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES. Granted, chocolate chip pancakes are delicious (elsewhere-idk about here), but to have chewy and dense red velvet pancakes that don't taste like it? Not acceptable. 

So now, I'm going to leave my little experience to an anomalous fluke because people seem to love it here and their red velvet pancakes. So maybe I just came in when they just weren't up to par. But I gotta review as I see and experience it. 

Will I go back? Maybe."}
{"text":"Good service, no wait. I had the Hawaiian Benedict it was good but I could of had a bigger portion. I would come again."}
{"text":"This place definitely has amazing pancakes. Their garlic rice is also great as well!! The only thing I wish is that they had a bigger restaurant. It's TINY and it gets PACKED in there."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! The food is amazing and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite is a stack of red velvet pancakes and I usually get the corn beef hash plate. This is my favorite breakfast spot! I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Wow they have a good breakfast! The breakfast burrito is my favorite and it comes with a side of your choice of pancakes! My wife also found her favorite place too. We highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why there is always at least a 30 min wait every time I come here...  The Red Velvet pancakes live up to the hype with a cream cheese icing on top.  A half-stack will satisfy you while at the restaurant, but get a full stack so you have something to munch on when you get home!"}
{"text":"After going to the original north Buffalo location, I figured it was time to try this location out.  For a Sunday the wait wasn't terrible at only 20 minutes.  After being seats the waitress quickly got our drink orders but disappeared for awhile which was strange.

Since Red Velvet is my \"go to\" I decided to try the S'mores pancakes.  They were good, with graham crackers, marshmallow and chocolate on top of chocolate chip pancakes.  They were really good and made for great leftovers, however not as good as the red velvet.

I can't give this location 5 stars only because the service just wasn't there, however everything else seemed exactly like the North location, of course I'll be back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"My first time here on a Sunday morning, the wait was 45 mins. I  was not disappointed by the food at all we had 3 different items to  taste. The pork eggs Benedict  was really good I was surprised how well cabbage and hollandaise sauce went together. The second best thing was the lemon ricotta pancakes really light and clean tasting. The bananas fosters pancakes were really tasty as well, but super sweet no way you would want that as a whole meal, but good to share with a few people. The waiter was very attentive came by a few times to refill coffee and waters. I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food all around. I had the carrot cakes with scrambled eggs and seasoned potatoes. Everything was tasty and the carrot cake pancakes was surprisingly fluffy without putting to many shredded carrots in it. We also had crepes at the table and they were damn good. All in all, a worthy place to eat. Friendly workers and great food."}
{"text":"For the most part this is a good place to eat. I love their food. It really is nice to have many types of pancakes to choose from. Their specials are always fun to try. Sometimes services is a little slower because it does get busy. Prices are a bit higher."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.

This place is awesome! 

The boyfriend and I were exploring our side of town for a good breakfast cafe, and we found one. Babystacks was VERY busy, but we waited less than 5 minutes. It was packed, so I was very impressed by the short wait!

I ordered the Cowboy skillet with regular pancakes. It was DELICIOUS! The menu is incredible. It has soooooo many options of pancakes! This is the place to visit when you're super hungry and wanting breakfast."}
{"text":"Baby stacks has perfected pancake batter. I'm not a pancake fan and they have made me come 3x in 1week after my first visit. 

The rest of the menu a good Filipino Hawaiian island flare to it. During the weekdays it's perfect not no 30-50min wait like the weekends."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are a must have item on their menu! The skillets are on point too! Great mom and pop breakfast and brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes is so good!!! It has so much flavor and the syrup is just right."}
{"text":"The 9th Island keeps its food game strong. 

Hmmm... I'll have the Hazelnut pancakes with a Nutella drizzle, whipped cream, hazelnut chunks and cocoa-powder and the S'mores pancakes, with marshmallows, and graham cracker chunks and because I need to battle all this sugar with some salt, so I can raise my blood pressure at the same time. I'll get the Chili covered Loco Moco. 

The things mentioned above are all real menu items that this crazy place serves and guess what it's all-amazing! I'm not into sweets, but I couldn't stop eating both of these pancake platters. My favorite had to be the hazelnut pancakes; no syrup needed just a healthy coating of Nutella and whipped cream. Food boner level is currently at eleven. 

The Chili Loco Moco. Now if you're not familiar with Loco Moco, this is classic Hawaiian comfort food dish; white rice, burgers and brown gravy. Now let's get unhealthy and add some chili to the mix. This is not by any means a refined dish, but when hung-over on a Sunday at 12:30pm I couldn't care less. I could have used a little more chili, but beyond that a great dish! 

The service here is amazing and food is stellar for what it is, \"Hawaiian Comfort Food\". Please Babystacks Cafe, update the decor. I'm definitely over seeing strip mall decor in all of these strip mall eateries."}
{"text":"i'm a fan! 

the red velvet pancakes was DELICIOUS. not too sweet, just cooked to perfection. the short stack was just the right amount cause otherwise i'd be in pancake overload. the bf and i also tried the kahlua pork benedict. i wasn't a fan of this dish. the pork was bland and the hollandaise sauce was whatever. the seasoned potatoes was okay, could use more seasoning. hah. overall, if it wasn't for the red velvet pancakes, i probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:10 on a Sunday morning and speed of service was great.  I had the Mexican Skillet and it was delicious - Marinated carnitas, sliced Jalepenos, tasty potatoes, sour cream and pico de gallo. My guy had Rick's Adobo Rice.  SO good had to steal a few bites.  Finished the breakfast with Red Velvet Pancakes.  Oh my! So good and so bad at the same time. Loved them! All was great! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I always love this place and have been going for a few years now. I'm seriously addicted to their red velvet pancakes but have also had their banana foster ones to and they were just as delicious. My kids love their s'mores pancakes as well. Once you have pancakes here then other pancakes don't taste as good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past 3 days. It's a brunch place with your traditional items along with Island inspired dishes and interesting pancakes. I tried their Rick's adobo fried rice, which comes wrapped in an omelette-style egg, and the loco moco, which has two eggs any style you want on house made burger patty on top of steamed white rice slathered in their gravy. Both were really good, although definitely a bit heavy for the morning. I opted to spend $1.50 more to add on their babystack pancakes as a side. I tried the red velvet which was delicious with the whipped cream but the cream cheese syrup was too heavy for me. The smores was okay. It didn't have much  chocolate chips and marshmallow in the batter and the toppings were lacking. Wish I tried the banana foster instead. 

My boyfriend liked the baby chick and omelette and the build your own omelette option. He also usually doesn't like pancakes but he actually enjoyed their cookies and cream pancakes.

Service was a hit or miss depending on how busy they are. We went weekday mornings so we didn't have to wait long but both times it was busy, although one day was definitely more bustling. It took a while to get their attention"}
{"text":"So we decide to try another location so I got the Portuguese sausage and over easy eggs with the garlic rice so freakin bomb I killed it and I'm a female for the hipe on the red velvet was eh but I don't care for pancakes my bf ate both meal and pancakes crazyyyyy service was good"}
{"text":"So we tried the adobo fried rice omelet...the hype is why I wanted to eat here..um it was ok that's because I'm really picky on my rice and soy sauce..which the rice taste like kikkoman soy sauce which I hate! Loyal aloha soy-sauce lover :) the bf killed it but he said I should've had more meat inside...it was a fast in and out experience not sure if I'll be back maybe for the pancakes but who knows"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Be advised that seating is extremely limited, and they don't have a bar where you can first come first serve sit. So come early or very late. Or wait! 

The banana fosters pancakes are the stuff dreams are made of. They serve every pancake with a wonderful cold, rich cream. Loco moco hits the spot. Not the best I've had but still great. You can combo up your pancakes as a side for only a buck more! 

Definitely eat here if you are in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Found this gem iff the strip and for sure this is worth visiting. Took the family which consists of 2 kids under 12. The menu was simple and there are plenty of pancake flavors to chose from. The staff was friendly and fast.  The prices averaged out to aboyt $12 per person,  included eggs, sasuage, potatos, pancakes, & coffee.  Everyone loved their pancake flavor.  Would definitely return"}
{"text":"O.M.G.  I'm a fan.  :)

Yea... Yea... it's a breakfast place that serves up dessert for breakfast.  I mean... their specialties are pancakes that are dessert-like.  They do have a big menu but I was fixated on the pancakes.  (There are egg dishes and ... Oh Yea... Spam dishes and Adobo Fried Rice on the breakfast menu... but I just couldn't order it all in 1 sitting .... Must Go Back!)

So... I had the Bananas Foster French Toast.  As you might expect... it was sweet. But Oh So Good!  I did wipe most of the whipped cream off of it.  And I should have asked for the syrup on the side rather than have them slather the whole plate in syrup.  Next time... I'll know better.  The bananas foster was good but like I mentioned to my friends... needed more rum.  :)  LOL!  That's just how I roll though.  :)  I did like it a lot though.

My girlfriend had the nutella pancakes and she pretty much licked the plate clean too.  So... all in all... a success.

My other 2 girlfriends opted for egg dishes and they enjoyed their breakfasts too.  None of us had a bad thing to say.  

The ambience is diner-like... small and tables are kinda close together.
There's usually ALWAYS a wait on the weekend.... so be prepared to wait.

They do have a lunch menu too... who knew?!  But I love breakfast and would probably always order off of the breakfast menu.  :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to breakfast spot. The Nutella crepes, red velvet pancakes, fried adobo, the breakfast potatoes, everything is amazing. I've had literally almost everything on the menu and it's always been perfect. Is there a wait? At times but it's bc this place is awesome and word is spreading. Do I care? No bc it's totally worth it. If I wanted fast food, I would go to a place specializing in fast food; just saying. Also, there is always take out if you don't want to wait and unlike some other breakfast places that shall remain nameless, they know exactly how to prepare a take out order; meaning they line styrofoam containers with tinfoil so my hot food doesn't sit directly on the styrofoam and cook to it which is a huge deal. So basically there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't be eating here. I'm going to end this now because it's Saturday so I'm off to have breakfast at Babystacks like always."}
{"text":"It seems like they changed their name from BabyCakes to BabyStacks, I guess to emphasize their pancakes...
We were a party of 3 that waited about 30 mins when we arrived at noon.  
I ordered ham and eggs with hash browns and s'mores pancakes.
My mom ordered eggs with seasoned potatoes and regular pancakes and my sister ordered the red velvet pancakes.
My over-easy eggs were made to perfection, 3 nice strips of ham steak was grilled and not overly salty, hash browns were ok - ketchup had to give it a boost and my s'mores pancakes were disappointing.  I was expecting something that was going to make my tastes buds happy and go \"mmmmmmm\" like how a s'more usually does... but that moment did not come.

My mom's seasoned potatoes had no flavor.

My sister's red velvet pancakes were a big flop; it was super bright in color (too much food coloring) and very lacking in flavor, if I was blindfolded, I would not have thought it was red velvet.  I guess I'm a little spoiled with red velvet pancakes from Cinnamon's out in Kailua, Hawaii - which is melt in your mouth chocolate heaven!

I really wanted to like this place but it's just all hype - I'll wait until I go back to O'ahu to get some real red velvet pancakes, I'm going to bring my sister next time she's there so she will know what I'm talkin' about."}
{"text":"This place is so good. So so so good. Order anything off the menu and you won't be disappointed. Go early because it has a small dinning room and everyone goes here."}
{"text":"Walked in at 2:40 and was greeted by waitors sitting at the bar saying \"are you fcken serious?!\" Getting annoyed because we are making them do there job. Working years as a busboy and waitor I understand its a bit annoying when customers come minute before closing. I don't think 20minutes is anything to complain about though. On top of that its very unprofessional. Its not my fault you signed up to work at job you don't feel like doing.

Aside from an unwelcoming rude greeting from the waitress sitting at the bar during work hours..our waitress Ally was nice and helpful. 

Food was good we had their red.velvet pancakes and the huntington which  was bomb!! Price is worth it! The red velvet with the dipping sauce was perfectly sweet.

Would definitely be coming back to eat the redvelvet pancakes but at a different location."}
{"text":"I love food, and I have had the pleasure of experiencing tons of particularly good food in my life. 

Very rarely, however, have had moment where tasting food left me speechless for a full five minutes. 

That is exactly what happened when I tasted the red velvet pancakes at Babycakes Cafe. There is absolutely no way 5 stars does them justice. They are heaven personified in a pancake. 

The other food I tasted was exceptional as well. The eggs, hashbrowns and bacon I had were cooked right to order and very fresh. The person I went with tried one of the Benedict options, and it was quite tasty too with homemade hollandaise. I also sampled the honey whole wheat pancakes and they were marvelous. Their secret is entirely homemade pancake batters, and the work pays off. 

Service was satisfactory; we were always greeted with a smile by every employee we came across and the food came out quickly despite being quite busy at the cafe. 

This place is well worth the drive from where I live in the University area, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Service was excellent and the food was so good!  We came here over 4th of July weekend for brunch.  Wait wasn't too bad.. took about 15 minutes for 5 of us to get seated.  Our server was great and offered up some suggestions on pancakes to try.  We ordered the Adobo Omelette, Hawaiian Benedict (so bomb!), and what seemed like every pancake on the menu.. Red Velvet, German Chocolate Cake, Boston Cream Pie, Hazelnut, and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut.  This is my 2nd time here and Babystacks did not disappoint!!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Place is a great breakfast stop. The adobo fried rice omelet is really good and the red velvet pancakes are of the hook. Great service, staff petty friendly little pricey but you get what you pay for quality! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love Denny's pancakes, that's the only place I'll order pancakes from when I'm out to eat, but not anymore. Babystacks has this cinnabun pancake option... fuggedaboudit. So good. Their pancakes are definitely the best thing on the menu and a close 2nd are their crepes. It may be a long wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Had a party of 7 today and everything was good so far. Friendly staff and quick seating. Although, after we got seated and placed our orders, we did not get our drinks until 10 minutes later. My friend and I were wondering why it took so long to receive waters all around. 

After waiting for 25 minutes we got our food. I ordered the Baby Chick Skillet for $7. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either. The potatoes were a bit soggy. I ordered over easy eggs to go with it and they were pretty runny. I probably won't get this again. 

BUT, Babystacks is known for their pancakes so I thought I'd get some. Their pancakes are the reason why I give this place 4 stars. I ordered their new \"Cookies n cream\" pancakes. They were amazing! The chocolate pancakes were cooked just right and were even better drenched in sweet cream sauce! My friend also gave me her lemon ricotta pancakes and they were refreshing! These crepe like pancakes with powdered sugar and sweet cream sauce were awesome. 

Overall, I recommend sticking to the pancakes over the food! I bet you'll enjoy them!"}
{"text":"Danielle was a great server! She was fast and had a fantastic smile. Super happy which is always so nice to see. Make sure you don't drink the water. I always forget how gross the tap water is in LV. The orange juice was artificial so also not something tasty to order. But my egg white skillet was delicious. I wanted to try something new so I ordered banana foster pancakes and was happy with my new discovery. The eggs were also good. We came towards closing so Danielle seemed very rushed but after observing her I just realized maybe it's just because she was super fast. This wasn't very first visit, I was a regular at Baby Stacks and it's always a satisfying visit."}
{"text":"I stopped in while on business and found this quintessential breakfast cafe with a little Pacific flair.  They offer a full menu of breakfast options with the addition of Spam or a Filipino style omelette.  I naturally opted for the Spam and eggs!  I left very pleased and will return the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking good everyone should go n try it!! 

went there one morning (cuz I saw they have red velvet pancake) we ordered adobo fried rice omelette, kalua pig benedict, and red velvet pancake. they have adobo fried rice omelette?!?!? waaaa is this a Filipino place?!?!? hahah anyways that omelette was freaking good!!! never taste anything like it!, n the kalua pig benedict was bomb too, love their hollandaise sauce on it! But the one that was really good was their red velvet pancake (warming: do not order the full portion cuz the half portion was massive, can't imaging the full portion). I had orgasm in my mouth when I was eating that pancake... ommggg cant wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Plan on a wait, unless get there early especially on the weekend. It's a small place but the pancakes are so worth it. I highly recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes. That would be part of my last breakfast on earth if I knew it was coming. Pretty good customer service most of the time as well."}
{"text":"Babystacks is my go to breakfast place. Today I went in for the two-egg breakfast & upgraded my pancakes to chocolate chip. About 30/40 mins after my order, I never received my pancakes. I had to go back to class therefore I cancelled my pancakes. I get up to the cashier & they want me to pay full price for a meal I DID NOT receive. Cashier was being rude about the whole situation and manager was \"busy\" despite being in my sight of view."}
{"text":"Five stars across the board!  Best panckes in NV. Adobo Fried Rice!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always had great and friendly service and the food was delicious. We had the Orange cremecicle pancakes, Butterfinger pancakes & Banana creme pie pancakes. I recommend BabyStacks Cafe to everyone. The wait can be long however it is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast with my cousin and my grandmother, waited 10 minutes(If even that long). Eric was our waiter and he was good! I ordered the piglet omelette with potatoes and red velvet pancakes. My cousin had a Loco Moco, and my grandmother got the adobo fried rice omelette. Love the atmosphere in there, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Could have been better! I thought the place was Closed because of the DIRTY glass front of the restaurant. Food is okay. Service is alright. A couple of Flies did some Fly bies
when I was eating. I stared at a Dirty duster behind the counter Gross! You guys have potentials just Clean the Place! Not very Appetizing specially early in the morning when most of us would like to have very Good start on the Day!"}
{"text":"I discovered Baby Stacks 2 years ago. 
I moved to Minnesota to then realize how much I miss the delicious, mouth watering menu at Baby Stacks The logo they have is really simple and inviting. At this location is big and personable. The staff is friendly and professional. The menu has a nice variety which I'm very fond of.

My favorite item to order here is the Mexican skillet So flavorful. 
The potatoes are nicely cubed shaped, which compliments the entire dish. On top of the perfectly golden potatoes cubs is the shredded pork. The shredded pork is  moist, breaks apart simply. Paired with jalapeños, and eggs served on top. On the side fresh Pico and sour cream and a side if buttermilk pancakes.

The hot tea is yummy served with honey.

When its time to pay the bill you go to the front and pay. 
 I recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I got the chicken adobo omelette, it was reminiscent of a Japanese omurice, which is fried rice folded inside of a plain egg omelette, except with this dish, it was like shredded filipino chicken adobo fried rice, delicious. 

My boyfriend got bacon eggs with a babystack of regular pancakes. When the food runner brought out the food, they brought out the order with scrambled eggs, when he got eggs over medium, but then she came back with the correct plate immediately without us saying anything. Lol. He said he wished it came with more syrup, and the bacon was too chewy for him. I though the bacon was fine though, and he got his extra syrup when he asked for it."}
{"text":"The only place that is a must visit when I come to town!! Forget the strip, EVERYTHING on the menu is to die for!! The service is always good, everybody is friendly and helpful! There is always a wait which is a good sign that they are worth waiting for!! You won't regret the calories here!!"}
{"text":"Super good food, love the strawberry cream crepes!! Not a long wait to be seated. Staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"Breakfast for 4 on memorial weekend. Super friendly service and can definitely feel the island vibes. 

This location is small so better get here early to avoid the wait times. 

Kids ordered chocolate pancakes and bacon pancakes. Wife ordered the Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice and I had the loco moco which is rice, a beef patty and eggs cooked the way you like. Decent sized portions and found myself struggling to finish the pancakes that can with my meal also. Place is know for their red velvet pancakes and other island dishes."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a gf's birthday. They arrive at 11:30 but couldn't be seated until I got there. They won't seat you without your entire party. We were seated right away when I arrived, at a table next to the kitchen. We were told our server would be with us shortly but it did take him quite a while to come by. We put in our order around 11:50 and our food came out at 12:20-12:25. We paid attention to the time because we had to be back at school by 1 PM. We did not anticipate food taking that long to come out. 

I ordered the cowboy omelette with a hazelnut short stack upgrade for $1.25 more. Its definitely worth it. Since we were all in a hurry to eat, I gobbled my hazelnut pancakes quickly. They weren't hot when they got to the table, but I didn't care. The flavor was spot on. Whipped cream with nutella drizzle and pieces of hazelnut made it a 5/5. The cowboy omelette comes with ham, peppers, mushrooms and cheese with a side of potatoes and according to their menu fresh red salsa. In my mind I thought it would be something like pico de gallo but it was blended (sort of like baby food) and was a weird orangeish color. The cowboy omelette was good, but was missing some veggies. Next time I'll have to add spinach and tomatoes or something. 

One of my gfs ordered the chili skillet, which was potatoes topped with chili and cheese and 2 eggs. She ordered white toast with her entree and it came out burnt. You could not tell if it was white or wheat! Our server did not check in on us after our food was dropped off and he was super busy so she did not ask for new toast. 

I really do love their pancakes but haven't been blown away by anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I heard amazing things about babystacks and was finally able to try it today. There was a 25 min wait for a party of 4 around 1 PM. When we left around 2 PM there was no wait and the restaurant was pretty empty. Service was good, waiter checked in on us and refilled our waters without us asking. 

My friend got the fried rice adobo which was too salty for her but she said the egg and some ketchup and hot sauce saved it. She also added the smores pancake on the side for $1.50 more. I got the kahlua pig Benedict with hash browns and it was definitely lacking some flavor. I had my friend try a piece and she agreed that It needed some hot sauce and salt. 

Portion sizes are big, especially if you're adding on a pancake! It's about the same size as their normal orders but instead of 3 or 6, you get 2. 

Brunch for 4 was $50 which isn't bad at all!

I know babystacks is known for their pancakes so it was probably a mistake ordering things that weren't pancakes. We will stick to pancakes from now on."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for so long. I have heard a lot of good things about BabyStacks (especially that they have Filipino/Hawaiian dish for breakfast) but they are always busy. The few times I tried going, the wait was over an hour. 

So Saturday morning, I woke up at 7am and made my way to an awesome breakfast. If there is something worth waking up to early on a Saturday morning, it's BabyStacks. 

Let me just say, they have the best red velvet pancake I have ever had. I am not super sold on Red Velvet altogether but I fell in love with their pancakes. It was moist and delicious. It was just pure perfection. I also ordered the famous Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice with a side of Portuguese sausages. It was good but I thought the adobo would taste like the adobo I used to eat growing up. I guess I set myself up for my own disappointment. I still liked it and I think it is worth the try. 

I would definitely be coming back to BabyStacks. I might even give the place right next to them a try if the next time they are packed. I saw that they the offer traditional Filipino breakfast, so excited for that. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love the cinnamon roll pancakes. Always make my food just the way I love it. It's very clean."}
{"text":"Why oh why can't this place be in Florida?!?!

My bf told me about this place and that we HAD to get breakfast here and definitely go here. Well we did just that! This place is small, but it makes you feel like you're at home.  We came around brunch time, and it was packed!  We only had to wait about 30 minutes and trust it's worth the wait.

I'm a lover of breakfast/brunch food, and gosh after reading the menu over and over I seriously just wanted a small portion of EVERYTHING! haha. But finally decided on Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. Lord have mercy!!!! Super super delicious, and the portion of this omelet stuffed adobo fried rice was insane!  I really loved the fact that the fried rice was served with egg because I was thinking about ordering a side of eggs, welp, sure didn't have to! It was divine, I don't know how else to explain it but dude JUST GET IT!

My bf ordered the LOCO MOCO and that was another nom nom nom dish!  The gravy with the beef patty was glorious AND served with eggs, uh hello?! SCORE!  He also ordered the RED VELVET PANCAKES, since we kept seeing on other yelpers review that it was a MUST, and let's just say it was the BEST red velvet pancakes I've ever had!  The cream cheese syrup was absolutely delicious!! My new favorite way of having syrup! Genius!

Alright, stop reading this review and go order already! This place is great and I'm definitely coming back whenever I visit!"}
{"text":"For the past couple of times that I ate at Babystacks, it has been a hit and miss for me.  The last time we ate there, at the Henderson location, our rice was not properly cooked.  As someone who is Asian and having rice as our staple food, we kind of know how it should be prepared.  AND, if an establishment will be serving Island/Asian infused food, they should get the rice cooked properly.  It was annoying having to eat soggy but hard rice with the spam.  Just didn't seem kosher.  So that just kind of put a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  But I still gave them 3 stars because the pancakes are always amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was cozy. Price was reasonable. Food was delicious. Our Server was friendly & knowledgeable. We will be back again. Thank you."}
{"text":"So i was in the Area and let me say I'm a total foodie... Babystacks wow!! Tons of menu options!!! for a fat kid like myself small Establishment, good customer service, Great food that packs a punch But Just watch....  Adobo omelet with fried garlic rice with onion... Bomb  I'll be Back!"}
{"text":"First time at this location and it was such an awful experience I won't return to any of their others. 

Arrived Sunday around 1PM was told 25 min wait so I put my name down and told the girl I'd be back in 20. I returned in 15 mins and she notified me my name was called I'd have to start the wait again (WHAT). So we waited another 12 mins and finally get seated. We placed our orders after being seated and waiting another seven mins. Our food took 23 mins meanwhile I see our waiter standing near a shelf enjoying his lunch. Once our food does get there (delivered by someone other than our waiter as he was busy snacking) it's all wrong. We had a cold omelette missing avacado, a side of pancakes that was half there. We were told the order is for two pancakes but only one of them is done I'll get the other one soon (it never arrived). Not to mention the one pancake arrived 11 mins after the rest of the food. We then get the bill go pay at the front. This might be more annoying than everything else mentioned, I signed the check for $40 even but I get a receipt for $42. I tell the girl and she says, \"oh uhm I can void if you'd like\". I said well yes I'm not tipping what you think I should tip after the experience we had and she says ok and voids then re does the transaction. 


Not only was the wait forever, girls at front counter were crabby, food was incorrect & cold but then they try to pull a fast one and have me tip more than I opted for. No thank you, I loved the centennial hills location but this experience has ruined babystacks for me. Never again."}
{"text":"There food is one of the best in las vegas! Omg I had some of there pancakes for breakfast and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Such great breakfast! I had chicken fried steak, the gravy was amazing! Also got the banana cream pie pancakes, they were fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great crepe place for quite sometime since I moved to Vegas. I was surprised to find this one in my area of town. Although the restaurant is small it reminds you of a family owned business. I ordered crepes with nutella and strawberries. First the waitress brought out the wrong meal but had no problem taking it back and my correct crepe came in less than 10 minutes. When I received them they were delicious! Perfect crepe texture and fresh berries. I defiantly recommend this place. This is a popular breakfast spot, especially on Saturday morning, so get there early or plan to wait in line for a long time. I think the wait is semi-worth it but I gave it 5 stars because if you walk right in and sit down your food comes out fast, and delicious."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are amaaaaaazing! Adobo fried rice is also a must-have."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and the servers were very nice. Superb Biscuits and gravy! The home fries tasted good when you order them crunchy. Different types of eggs Benedict. You just have to try them all."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  Everything.  The only thing I wish was that the place  a bit bigger.  Also, don't try to split checks.....

Other than that I loved everything about it....

Get the red velvet!!! :)"}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had- chocolate batter is where it's at! I had the chicken skillet, added hollandaise, upgraded to cookies and cream pancakes. My bestie had a cowboy skillet and she upgraded to German chocolate pancakes. All amazing! I've been to another babystacks years ago - then had a bunch of pancake tasting with my friend and none have disappointed! Pancake lovers, you're in the right place. ;)"}
{"text":"I was originally drawn to this restaurant because of the stellar reviews, but I left BabyStacks feeling completely underwhelmed. I ordered a basic breakfast - scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, and hashbrowns. On the whole, I felt like everything was under-seasoned and very bland tasting. While the gravy was okay, the biscuits were hard, the gravy was under-seasoned, the hashbrowns were not appetizing at all, and the eggs tasted like they came out of a box. The coffee was not even that great. 
I would honestly pass on this restaurant and if you're in a pinch, head to an IHOP. At least you'll get a more appetizing meal than the one you'd get here."}
{"text":"Average at best, and the service is always slow. I'm very disappointed that they will no longer be serving the Orange Creamsicle pancakes. If you get one of the sweet pancake opinions I suggest getting a side. The pancakes are very rich!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I recommend the adobo fried rice or omelette! And of course everyone's favorite is the red velvet pancakes"}
{"text":"First timers!!! Great food and a huge selection of pancakes . Fast & Friendly Service. Open for bfast and lunch only. Adobo Omelette was delicious and was a huge portion. Red Velvet pancakes was heavenly"}
{"text":"Wow...just wow.  Best breakfast I have had in years! I had the ranchero skillet. Chili's, green sauce, chicken, cheese, and hash browns topped with 2 over medium eggs.  Fantastic.  My girlfriend had the county fried steak and eggs.  I tried it and it was fresh and delicious.  Not chewy and tough like other places.  Pancakes are to die for.  For sure go to breakfast spot next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Thanks to Ardie Y, my friends and I found a new breakfast place to eat in Las Vegas.  We came on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was busy; I believe we waited 45 minutes.  Echo the hostess welcomed us and asked for our name.  In the front, there are benches so you can sit while you wait for your table.  I was looking at the menu and there were a lot of tempting breakfast items to choose from.  The pancakes that caught my attention were, carrot, bacon, hazelnut, cinnamon, banana cream pie, orange creamsicle, rocky road,  white chocolate chip macadamia nut, and cookies & cream.  We ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (comes with one side), Portuguese Sausage & Eggs, and Cora's Corned Beef Hash and Eggs.  Then we got pancakes, Banana Foster, Cinnabun, and Red Velvet.  

::Food::
I was curious about Rick's Adobo (traditional Filipino dish) Fried Rice.  The way they served the adobo was creative.  It was wrapped in an omelet, inside was shredded chicken, rice, and garnished with green onions.  I like the concept but the flavor tasted different.  Also, there was more rice than chicken.  The Portuguese sausage and corned beef hash were good, they both came with poached eggs.

::Highlight::
The PANCAKES!!  The Banana Foster is my favorite.  It was topped with caramelized bananas, whip cream, and cinnamon sugar.  Next is the Red Velvet (best seller), the color of the pancake was bright, it was topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumble and came with a side of cream cheese.  Then we also got the Cinnabon pancake.  It had sweet icing, crunchy pecans, and dusted with cinnamon and sugar.  I would get the Banana Foster, Red Velvet, and Portuguese Sausage & Eggs again!

::Customer Service::
Echo was very friendly.  We didn't know which pancakes to order but Lilly was very helpful by answering all our pancake questions.  

::Tip::
Remember all parties must be present to be seated. 

::M's Notes::
-Arrive early, it gets busy so anticipate to wait especially on the weekends
-Parking lot
-Inside seating"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and I must say...FANTASTIC pancakes! They have such a unique selection. I'd try different kinds but every time I go, I just need to order the banana cream pie stacks. Great food and friendly atmosphere at a decent price."}
{"text":"Loved the service we received from our kind waitress! The atmosphere was so friendly and the place was super clean! I ordered the piglet skillet and added veggies to it! We ordered our food and it came out less than 10minutes!!! I saw an order of pancakes come out and I was like omg!!! Next time I come here I am definitely having those!!! If you haven't had tried this place...you need to!!!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to add about this place that hasn't already been said in other reviews, but here is my review nonetheless. Babystacks is a true gem in Las Vegas! We used to travel clear across town to their location on the north side of Vegas just for their amazing Red Velvet pancakes. When we found out there was a new location on the west side of town and just minutes from our house we were sooooooo happy! From the Red velvet pancakes to the zippy's omelet, everything we've tried there has been amazingly delicious. Only drawback is the dining space is small and there is usually a wait, but some things are just worth waiting for! Try this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the Northwest hands down. Great service, good prices. The red velvet pancakes are to die for. Only down side is there is usually a wait, but that's because the food is good!"}
{"text":"Came in at 12:30pm on a Thursday and had no wait for a table. Score! The interior reminded me of a Friendly's, simple wood decor and very family friendly, but also a bit messy. There was a soda lid on the floor by our table and a fly that kept landing on my arm, but let's be honest, you're not here for the ambiance, you're here for their amazing selection of pancakes. 

Those babycakes...whoa. So good. I would suggest starting out with a short stack bc the sheer amount of sugar in these things will start to get to ya, but holy is it worth it. These bad boys are delicious. I had the pleasure of taking down a few cinnabun style today and I'm thinking of going back for more. Sweet icing on the top, cinnamon sprinkled throughout and just a few crumbled nuts on top, it was just like eating a cinnamon bun (Costanza style), but you get to dip it in syrup. Win. 

Not a sweets person and looking for eggs? Yea, they got that. They omelets are pretty standard and the hashbrowns are crunchy and not over-salted. You won't be wow-ed, you won't be disappointed. You WILL get jealous of your friends eating amazing pancakes."}
{"text":"Soo good!! TONS of different flavored pancakes. You wana get there early, waited a lil while to be seated & they close early. Everything on the menu is good with good prices.

A HOT SPOT!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went on a Vegas trip and my bro recommended some spots off of the strip. This was one of them.

What we ordered:
-Adobo fried rice omelette
-Red velvet and white choco macadamia nut pancakes
-Loco moco
-Spinach omelette
-Kalua pork benedict

Everything was so good. The stars of the show is most definitely the adobo fried rice omelette and the red velvet pancakes. The portions here are pretty big. My family left with a food coma, which isn't a bad thing bc it just means it was too good to stop eating lol. The wait was pretty long, but understandable as it was Sunday brunch, but it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I like this place! The red velvet pancakes are divine! All the components put together, with the whipped cream, chocolate chips, & cream cheese syrup, it's 3000+ calories of fantastic goodness for 'breakfast'! The menu has lots of choices, it's asian style of course, with typical Hawaiian and Filipino style breakfast items, and also has the boring American style stuff for my white husband, who does enjoy the adobo fried rice omelette though ;). It's super busy on weekends, but we live nearby so we do pick up all the time. Loco Moco with the garlic fried rice upgrade is awesome. Wish I could eat like this everyday, but then I could see why some Island folks look they way they do, and my blood pressure probably couldn't take it either. You gotta try this place if u havent already.
On another note, not sure why Yelp 'filters' my reviews as not real reviews. Your auto computer filter programs can suck it!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! So many pancake options, it's hard to choose. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. I had the Kalua pork eggs Benedict. It was delicious. The pancakes were very good too. The girls had eggs and cakes and they eat them up. 
Get there early, there is usually a wait after 8:00a on the weekend."}
{"text":"So yummy!! This place is my go-to breakfast cafe. Although, they are insanely busy on weekends so be prepared to wait if you go then."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch with my Fiance and her family. We showed up at 10:45 on a Sunday and  the wait was over 30 minutes.  Because  friends recommended the place and warned us about the wait, we were expecting it, so I can't complain. 

Staff was super friendly and the food came quick. We were checked on numerous times throughout the meal for refills on coffee and water. 

I had the carrot cake pancakes on the side which were the bomb. I will definitely be back. I really want to explore the Filipino side of the breakfast menu on my next visit, and will probably try a different kind of pancake every time. 

I am docking one star because my omelet didn't have very much filling in it. It was supposed to have sausage and bacon, but it was kind of sparse; almost mixed into the eggs in very small pieces."}
{"text":"So perfect. We were starving and had Vegas brain but stopped by on way to Hoover Dam and glad we did! Eat a Baby Stack of something yummy, no matter what you order."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time!  It keeps me coming back.  The pancakes are amazing and there is a variety of flavors and toppings to choose from to satisfy whatever mood you're in.  My favorite is the chili moco with garlic rice and a short stack of their delicious pancakes!  I wash it all down with either a cup of coffee or a tall glass of OJ."}
{"text":"I visited Baby Stacks for breakfast, after waiting for 30min we were seated. We ordered our our food which was pretty good. Once we were fo idhed eating ee waited over 15 min for the waitress to return. Tired of waiting, we took the check to the register, paid and left. As we are walking to our cars the person who waited on us was running after us yelling and accusing us of not paying out check. I was insulted, embarrassed and furious. I went back to Baby Stacks few days later and spoke with the manager who quickly dismissed me with a slight apology and a \"we'll follow up with you.\" Of course  I never heard back from them. I never went back either."}
{"text":"Eh... Their food is decent but you feel like you are eating on top of other tables.... if you have to get up to go to the bathroom, you're bumping into 5 different tables just to get up. The waitress' are so busy and take forever to refill drinks so thats frustrating. They are also so busy and their waiting area isn't much of a waiting area so it's not even worth it to go here on a weekend anymore.. You try to pay your bill and you're having to move constantly to get out of the way of the hostess seating people and then you lose your place in the long line of people attempting to pay."}
{"text":"Finally made it out here after reading all the reviews pumping this new \"Yelp Whore\" out.

I won't add too much because the other 100+ reviews covers it but I thought the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice was a little too salty.  I think when the rice is cooked with the adobo it really absorbs the flavor and it gets too salty.  Others may like.  Still it was ok.

As the majority stated, the red velvet pancakes are the star of the show.  Order a 2 egg breakfast and pay the extra 1-2 bucks to upgrade to Red Velvet.

We'll be back.  Will try the benedict next time."}
{"text":"I won't be suprised if Babycakes/BabyStacks ever expands into a franchise.  It's ridiculously tasty, highlighted by their red velvet pancakes.

The pancakes are perfectly cooked, soft and cake-like in the center with a hint of crispness on the outside. Its coupled with the crack addicting cream cheese frosting. It's a must order for any Baby virgin. 6 pancakes come in a full stack.

We also ordered the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs. For less than 2 bucks, you can upgrade regular pancakes to specialty. We got the carrot cake which were yummy but the red velvet trumps them all.

Be sure to take advantage of the current Yelp deal - 15 dollars for 7 bucks. You can buy up to 3 and it excludes Fri and Sat.

Love the Hawaiian fusion, music, and service. It won't be long until they open up another location on the Eastside I predict."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as always but the waitress Shawni was incredibly rude. I've been going to babystacks for years and that was the worst service I've gotten"}
{"text":"Pancakes were great. Worst Loco Moco I have ever had. Hamburger patty just hockey puck like. Rice was dry and kind of stake. Staff did not seen to care. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place now when I am in town from the bay visiting my fam. Been here a few times and I am never disappointed. Service is always good aside from a little longer wait when they are busy but it's understandable. Everything is always tasty. My Favorite is their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette , all the egg Benedict's and most definitely their yummy selection of pancakes !!! Everything from the Red Velvet to the Banana Fosters pancakes are soooo yummy it's bad ! I absolutely feel the #fattystatus feeling after eating here but it's sooo worth it . CHEAT MEAL FOR REAL!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat breakfast! Las Vegas has so many choices to choose from and BabyStacks delivered. This place is busy and our wait was not long at all. Although, this restaurant is tiny, their meals are BIG! Service was fast and great! Not one complaint coming out of my mouth. Wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the lemon ricotta pancakes were lacking in flavor. 

BabyStacks is located right outside of Summerlin, so I expected good food and service. I would return here for breakfast ask for Mariazuzena! Great job!"}
{"text":"Delicious and great service, even with a packed house. I love the mix of traditional, Hawaiian, and Filipino breakfast options; it was so hard to choose! That just means that we have to come back for more."}
{"text":"I was delighted to discover this restaurant while in town for the week of Thanksgiving.  I typically don't like to eat at restaurants with traditional American breakfast fare as I dislike maple and pancake syrup.  To my surprise they have an awesome selection of pancakes that have enough flavor or toppings hence eliminating the need for syrup.  
My family was happy, they got their traditional steak and eggs and chicken fried steak fix. Both husband and daughter said the hash browns were some of the best they've had in forever. Crispy and not loaded with oil.  Both subbed traditional pancakes for the premium pancakes.  He got the German chocolate, she got the Chocolate Chip/cookies and cream (I can't recall what they're called).  I sampled my husbands german chocolate pancakes (which means I totally stole and took over), they were delightful! I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, while they were good I'd try something different next time.  Our server was awesome and retrieved me some cream cheese topping to sub out the traditional pancake syrup.  

Yes there is a wait because this is a small location but it is well worth the wait.  Food was delish and was served piping hot.  Server and busser were attentive during our visit."}
{"text":"We got take out and I don't recommend it. I ordered and picked it up, at most, 15 minutes after and the steak and eggs were room temp and the bacon wasn't crispy.  Overall, the food was alright, the hash browns and eggs weren't seasoned at all and just bland, I added salt to the entire meal which helped a little. Considering the two BREAKFAST meals were $30 (without tip), we'll stick to Egg Works that's much more reasonable and tastier."}
{"text":"Sitting next door at Sierra Gold eating my breakfast as a write this. Came here this morning with my boyfriend (just the two of us). The receptionist said our wait would be about 20 min. which is pretty standard and usually well worth it, because the food is amazing. The 1 Star is not for the food, it's for the lack of service. There was a party of 11 that walked in roughly about 15 min after we got there and they were seated within 10 minutes. Our name apparently wasn't written on the board when we arrived, which made us appear after the party of 11. Not cool at all. Such an easy task obliterated. You've lost a customer."}
{"text":"The pancakes are spectacular!  I had the S'mores short stack pancakes and my husband ordered the bacon pancakes with a side order of hash browns.  The S'mores pancakes are light fluffy pancakes, with chococate, graham cracker pieces, marshmallows and topped with cool whip.  They give you syrup on the side but you really don't need it.  My husband thought the bacon pancakes could have used more bacon but still enjoyed his breakfast and the hash browns.

The staff was very friendly and our waiter was spectacular even with the restaurant being packed full of customers.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Everything was very good, I built my own omelet with strawberry pancakes on the side. The service was just as good, I'd recommend stopping by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, the red velvet pancakes are definitely worth checking out if you've never been there. They have a lot of off the wall breakfast items that make it interesting but I probably wouldn't go back. I'm not from Vegas so when I do visit I'm on the strip at a hotel, this restaurant isn't bad at all but it isn't close to the strip either."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious. Where else could i have ordered garlic rice and carrot cake pancakes ? Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals and their themed pancakes. Deffinitely best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait not worth the food, IHOP pancakes are much much better, pancakes were not tasty and they were dry. Won't be going back here anytime soon"}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes, great customer service, and all around creative menu. Definitely my go to breakfast spot, I highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch. Ask for the pancake special of the day!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had b-fast at Baby stacks yesterday. Very well done. I had the carrot cake pancakes and we both feel they were even better than the red velvet. The coffee was very good as well as the eggs and potataos."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and some unique breakfast combinations. Flavors always pop.  The pulled pork and spam are worth a look!"}
{"text":"I have had this restaurant bookmarked for the past few months and always found myself having no time to check it out every time I was in Vegas. Never again will I make this sort of mistake. I still can't get over how good food is off the strip! 

We came during the breakfast/brunch rush and were seated at the counter. I was surprised that the restaurant was so full. It seems like a hit with the locals. I'm not sure if it was the business of the restaurant, but we had to wait longer than usual for even our waiter to take our order. After ordering though, he was pretty attentive so I can't really complain. 

Now, I'm a HUGE breakfast and brunch fan! Their extensive menu is mostly geared towards breakfast food, with just one page dedicated to their lunch menu. At first I thought it was just your regular American type of Breakfast and Brunch place, but they also have Hawaiian plates such as Loco Moco and Spam Scramble. Apparently they're known for their pancakes, or \"BabyStacks\". There was such a huge variety that I felt pretty overwhelmed. I wanted to try everything! Thanks to Yelp, I just had to order the Red Velvet short stack. Seriously, this was pretty much a dessert party in my mouth! Probably one of the best Red Velvet pancakes I've had. The pancakes had whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and this amazing cream cheese syrup. It was amazing! We also ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which is adobo fried rice that's stuffed into an egg omelette. The rice had so much flavor and adding sriracha really brought out the flavor of the dish altogether. 

Overall the food met my expectations and I can't wait to come back during our next trip and try the other food! Gracias! Salamat! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place until the decor changes and after discovering Black Bear Diner who's prices and portion sizes are much better in terms of value for dollars. Sorry no offense in regards to the decor, but having a mixture of Anime and Ikea items / pictures doesn't mix in my opinion. Food is pretty good and the service is good too. Just in comparison with other breakfast diners it comes off a little tacky and over priced."}
{"text":"Overrated restaurant. Pancakes are unique, but don't expect anything to be much better than a typical diner. Service was horrible on a mediocre morning. Understandable they don't seat you until your entire party is present but when you have several open tables and your customers mention they have a funeral to attend and you still don't have compassion to seat paying customers who are ready to order, leaves a bad taste in our mouths on an already difficult day. We will never return."}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning and unfortunately I could only give this place 3 stars. The food was delicious but the service was not up to par. The server we had was very awkward and barely spoke . She kind of looked like she was nervous . Maybe it was her first day? Food is good and prices are pretty low as well so it might be worth a try ."}
{"text":"I stood and waited to be seated for more than 5 mins while multiple employees stared at me. Shitty customer service, I came in at 1pm where it was not busy at all"}
{"text":"I tried to come here once before with my husband and couldn't get in the wait was over and hour. So on his birthday we came back. First the girl told me it would be a 20 min wait for a table when there was only one party ahead of us with 3 ppl. I peaked in the dining room and here were 2 empty two seater tables. When we were sat a couple minutes later I found service A bit slow. I ordered the spinach Benedict and my husband got the French toast. 
The Spinach Benedict was HORRIBLE! It had this strange cheese wiz all
Over it. I asked the waiter if that was the hollandaise sauce and he said it was and I could change it if I wanted to for another item on the menu. I said I just scrap it off. Half my plate was this thick cheese wiz like sauce. 
My husbands French toasts was good but cold!!! And the syrup the brought us was cold too!!! 
We will never go back there and I can't understand where all these good reviews came from... If I thought it was a
Bad day I would give it a second chance but sadly I think they just suck"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place out one sunday morning a little while back for breakfast. Fully expecting to have a wait ahead of us we decided anyway to give it a shot based on what we had heard from friends. As we arrived we saw the large crowd that was waiting to be seated yet saw an empty patio and thought \"well hell its 75 degrees out, why don't we just sit outside\". Once we were able to squeeze our way up to the hostess counter to place our name on the list and asked if outside seating were available we were told that they don't take requests. I was a little perplexed as to what that meant and was informed that they let people choose inside or outside seating once there name is called. The wait was 45 minutes which bothered me seeing an empty outside patio yet packed inside but my wife, being my calm, level headed better half told me to me just calm down and that every place we would go to would have a wait anyway so since we are here we should just tough it out. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes and not once did anyone go sit outside. Once our name was called, we asked the server if we could sit outside and we were told that the patio was closed....The dining room was pretty loud being such a small space with a lot of people and it didn't make sense as to why the patio was closed. They had more then enough staff it appeared, to equip the 4 tables outside but it was what it was. After all that we ended up sitting down and eating a decent breakfast, not terrible but nothing we couldn't have gotten elsewhere. I had the Loco Moco and my wife had the buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes I tried were good but nothing I would give 5 stars to. The service was lacking a bit in friendliness and overall I am not mad at the place for its weird seating policy or its standard food but mainly just disappointed for what transpired that morning."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went for brunch with my boyfriend the other week- he ordered the adobo omelette and I got the Nutella French toast. Both were very delicious!! Lots of items on their menu. Definitely coming back soon to try the corned beef hash!"}
{"text":"Mmmm pancakes!!! Each time I've come here I've had an omelette and substituted for the lemon baby stacks. So. Freaking. Delicious."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my new favorite local breakfast spots! They have many different varieties of pancakes, all which are very delicious. And always keep a watch out for their specials as they are amazing.

I've been here about a half a dozen times for breakfast now, & I have to say that I will now be a regular almost every week. They have friendly wait staff always delicious meals. It's never a hit and miss. It's always very good and consistent. 

I'm usually a healthy eater so I only come here on my cheat days but when I do cheat, I come to babystacks.

Grade A in my book!"}
{"text":"Since when have they been called baby stacks? In any case, it is still one of the best morning cafés I have been to in Nevada. My cousin and I went at about eight in the morning on a Sunday. We really thought that it would be completely packed, but we lucked out and there were still quite a few seats available.

Again I ordered the red velvet pancakes, and it was delicious. I also had a spam and egg contraption that was quite filling, though I can't remember exactly what it was called.

Like I said before, you can't go wrong with anything you pick off the menu!"}
{"text":"always a wait but the red velvet pancakes are bomb but everything else is really gross from there eggs to there bacon to there water just get the pancakes to go that's honestly the only thing that's worth the wait"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The customer service, the food, and oh my gosh those pancakes! My husband and I always share a different kind everyone we want to try it all! It is worth the wait on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Best crepes ever! The strawberry crepe was not overly sweet. It was just right. Coffee was really good. Staff were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Worst Pancakes ever!!!  I'm reading the reviews , I'm not agree. First and last time and that place"}
{"text":"You had me at RED. VELVET. PANCAKES (although here they call them \"babystacks.\") I'm so in love with them my heart is breaking from being apart. I've always liked red velvet cupcakes/cakes, but cluelessly had never thought of it being made into different forms of carb goodness. 

Baby Stacks is a normal looking breakfast joint in a normal looking shopping mall, but what lurks inside is NOT normal. The food here has a bit of a Hawaiian influence that results in an AWESOME party in your mouth ;) 

We each ordered from the \"Breakfast Favorites.\" The hub had the \"bacon and eggs\" and chose hash browns and buttermilk babystacks. I had their \"Portuguese sausage and eggs\" and chose rice and their specialty RED. VELVET. BABYSTACKS. The hub said his breakfast was good, but you can get what he ordered anywhere else that serves breakfast. My order on the other hand was absolutely FANTASTIC! There's no way to describe the joy and utter elation I felt when those red velvet cakes hit my tongue *cue foodgasm noise.* Done deal, 5 stars! As soon as those stacks hit the table I pounced and I pounced hard! Oh man, I can't wait to have them again. They're perfectly done and when you add the cream cheese icing/syrup with the gorgeously whipped cream, it's utter food heaven. 

So, what have we learned? Don't come here for a \"normal\" breakfast and get here fast because this place fills up quick! And please, please don't say I didn't warn you when you fall in love at first bite ;)"}
{"text":"Came in and asked how long the wait was for a party of 5 ( 3 adults & 2 babies) she said 30mins which was fine because I had to wait for my sisters. So when they arrived we waited pass the 30min time slot given and what was upsetting is that she had sat everyone else who had walked in after my whole party was there. I enjoy the food but the service has lacked through the years. Used to come here often but now only from time to time but probably changed to not coming back again. I love their red velvet pancakes but if I have to wait for a decade it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Had some doctor appointments and happened on Babystacks for lunch.  
The place holds 50 clients max.  Neat, clean, not a lot of decoration but the food makes up for it,
Hawaiian breakfast items and benedicts have become the hot trend here in Vegas so put this little cafe at the top of your list.
I love Banana pancakes and the short stack of 3 (couldn't finish) was chock full of bananas both inside and out.  I opted out of the powdered sugar sprinkle. 
My hubby got Huevos Rancheros with a side of nicely browned hash browns.  He almost finished it.  It was not too spicy which was fine with him.
Our neighboring table got beautiful Kahlua Pork sandwich with fries and the gentleman got some substantial Eggs Benedict.
Prices are reasonable.  Hours 7-2 during the week.  Unknown during the weekend.
Great little place.  You may wait for your order a bit longer than normal, but you will enjoy every succulent bite"}
{"text":"On numerous occasions I call to place a to go order and am put on hold for 20 min! I hang up and call back only to not be able to get through, because they set the phone down and forget about it! THEN when I either do get through or have to drive down there, they never apologize! I understand you are busy, but if you're too busy then hire another person or for the love of God apologize!!!! I'm so fed up with this happening that I am willing to now drive an extra 10 minutes to go to egg works where their customer service is on point! You're food is good, but your service makes it not worth it! I truly hope that management reads this so they rectify this issue for other people."}
{"text":"First time here. The pancakes look like dessert, taste like dessert, they're awesome! I got the Bananas Foster pancakes, my husband got the Red Velvet ones. Both were exceptional."}
{"text":"I go here for brunch almost every weekend! I try something different every time and have yet to be disappointed. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito and of course any of the specialty pancakes. There is usually a 30-45 minute wait on Saturdays and Sundays but service is very fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I just had to hear what all the hype was about on these pancakes here so i decided to place a \"to-go\" order last week for a full order of red velvet panackes and half of a order of the banaca cream pie pancakes. Well my order was placed and told that I can pick them up within 20 minutes. Well i always give an extra 5-10 minutes when i place \"to-go\" orders just because not all the time are these orders ready. Well keep in mind this was my first time choosing to eat here and when i arrived the place was PACKED, but this is expected on a Sunday right? Anyways i paid for my order to only find out that my order was STILL not ready after me arriving 35 minutes later. Well the girl working the front registar went and checked on my order and said they were still working on my order. No problem. Well after about 10 more minutes she checks again and brings out 2 boxes of somebody else's order. Pretty annoying now at this point i've been waiting 45 minutes for what was suppose to be a 20 minute wait. She apologized and said my order would be right out. Well 15 minutes later my actual order came out and at this point i was basically over this whole pancake experience. They gave me a $10 gif certificate for the wait time. Nice gesture.. i guess.. The pancakes are Okay... Red velvet's were the best and the banana cream pie ones i could have made myself.. Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"This last time here n the service was great as well as the food. They r offering special babystacks right now with pumpkin, Apple or mocha coffee. We each tried the pumpkin & apple....delis!!!! Hubby loved the corn beef hash. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me: I love going out for breakfast. My dear hubby doesn't. He mostly hates the smell and idea of griddle fry. Don't blame him so this weekend, a holiday weekend, he asks, \"Wanna go to breakfast?\" Um, YEAH! So off we go to wait somewhere for breakfast. I chose a no-egg-in-title-ergo-no-griddle-fry, breakfast joint, for this rare occasion. Been to Babystacks a couple years ago before the name change. It was good but mostly crowded, and we were suckered into ordering the red velvet pancakes. As pancakes go, they were good, but honestly, it was a mistake to order because not particularly a fan of red velvet because of the systematic abuse of red food coloring and fake chocolate flavor that occurred as a result of the trend that been red velvet in the last decade, as opposed to the light cocoa flavor it's supposed to have. This time, however, we partook in the Hawaiian-style brekkie (Moco Loco and Portuguese sausage and eggs w rice) as well as a skillet and of course many sides of many non-red velvet pancakes (banana cream pie, cookies and cream, lemon ricotta) plus a Nutella crepe. Suffice it to say, everything was delicious, not greasy, no odor of the dreaded griddle fry, and despite all the food ordered, we all left satisfied and not overly stuffed. There was a wait, but turn-around was efficient and quick as could be. Place was clean and friendly and did we mention no griddle fry? Btw, their red velvet pancakes are, in fact, good if you still like the trend, er...flavor. 

Him: The pancakes were soft and delicious. I ordered cookies and cream pancakes. They were so chocolatey. They came with cream and glaze, but I didn't even need the glaze. Also, I loved the skillet. It wasn't a scramble, just over-easy eggs on top, so there were sautéed veggies underneath and they were so good. I couldn't stop eating them. There were potatoes, onion, peppers and mushroom and cheese. There was a wait but it felt like forever (it actually was about 20 mins after told 30). That is how good the place is: everyone wants to eat there so we had to wait forever. It was worth the wait. I would wait again millions more times for their pancakes and veggies."}
{"text":"Lolo Rick's Chicken Adobo + Red Velvet Pancakes = BOMB.COM

Since 2014 and every year since then, I've always made it a point to eat here at least once or twice for the duration of my trip while in Vegas. The food is delicious and the service is always spot on! 

My only request is, that they opened up a location in the Bay Area. I would be there every weekend or at least every two weeks..."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for pancakes, DELICIOUS!  My family likes the Hawaiian influence in their menu.  Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Pros:  kalua pig egg benedic was very favorful.  Red velvet pancakes moist and yummy.  Loco moco was winners!

Cons:  seating-we had a party 3 and waited for about 30 minutes, which isnt bad for a sunday morning.  However they were seating parties of 2 right when they walked in??!!  That was a bit annoying, esp when there was about 4-5 parties of 2 being seated before you!"}
{"text":"Babystacks- omelettes great!!  The French toast was good.  Eggs Benedict - not great - but not bad.   All the different pancakes - fantastic.  The service was great!!  The coffee was pretty good too!! There is a line -so expect to wait a bit!"}
{"text":"Baby got stacks!!! And stacks and stacks to choose from, of pancakes might I add! This was my first time coming here and I left fat, full, and beyond satisfied!! Baby stacks menu gave me an island feel with offerings like Kalbi and eggs, Portuguese sausage, and a fried rice omelet! 

I had to try the Kalbi and eggs! It came with rice, 2 over easy eggs, and the star of the show..Kalbi ribs. The eggs were cooked perfectly, which is an art these days! The rice was took up a notch seasoned with furikake! The Kalbi was tender and the flavors would have had mothers everywhere dodging slaps! Yes I said it, my breakfast was slap ANYBODY'S mama good! 

Last and more than mentionable, I took home the Nutella crepes for my kids to try being they were not invited. Long story short! These crepes were much too good for children! They were slamming! The Nutella was so creamy and rich, the crepe was cooked to perfection, and the bananas were the perfect match! Let's just say maybe next time Kids! *wipes Nutella from cheek*

This is a great place to meet with friends and also take your family for a good meal! Get there early they close at 2!"}
{"text":"My spot for breakfast comfort food. Traditional breakfast items plus some island inspired dishes. Loco moco is super good. They had me at spam eggs and rice. Yum!  Their huge variety of pancakes makes breakfast dessert a must. Red velvets are my fave. Service is always on point too"}
{"text":"My burger patty on the chili moco was undercooked so I sent it back and asked for a new one. The new one was undercooked as well. At that point I was just hungry so I picked around the burger and ate the rest. The restaurant should have taken it off the bill, but they didn't. Been going to Babystacks for years, now I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"I love it here. 

Delicious pancakes are the way to go! Their original and red velvet ones are my favorite. They are so fluffy. 

I always get their eggs and sausage. Can't go wrong. 

It's always busy when I go with a little wait, but it's worth it and the service is always good. 

You pay at the front."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Best pancakes in town and their chili is good too. Potatoes are good as well and although they're always busy, their customer service is always great. Bathrooms are clean"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and of course I had to try the red velvet pancakes I kept reading about. They were definitely good. Friendly staff. It was a little busy when we arrived. I would return and try their other items."}
{"text":"Great pancakes  and lightning fast take out. We had the Red Velvet and Smores pancakes and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I heard this location was opening up a few months ago and was pretty excited since it's right around the corner from us. We've been to one of the other locations in the past and liked it a lot. Naturally since it's a new spot they were really busy...but they have a lot to work on.

It looks like they run specials on the whiteboard up front which is cool. I decided on the cookie butter french toast and my wife had the biscuits and gravy. The french toast was decent but there was a lot of egg leftover on the sides of the bread and they basically just threw a huge scoop of cookie butter on top. It wasn't anything special and I can't say I'd order it again. My wife's biscuits and gravy was really good at the other location but at this one it didn't even come close. The biscuits were dry and the gravy was super plain, almost flavorless. 

The whole experience just wasn't what we expected since we liked the other one so much. While the service was ok, not everyone was friendly and they seemed to be understaffed. We walked in and had to wait almost 45 minutes but at least 10 tables were open. They must have turned away 5 or more parties because of the long wait times. We'll be back in a few months to see what's happening but if you're a fan, I'd stay away from this location for a bit."}
{"text":"I've been to Baby stacks a couple times now, and I've been impressed everytime. The food is great, the portions are generous, and the service was impeccable. The Cinnabon pancakes were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place DEFINITELY lives up to all the hype. The food was amazing, the service was amazing. We had Felicia and she was so incredible! My husband and I had been kind of avoiding this place cause it's always pretty busy, but I'm glad we stopped in today. Highly recommend going here and they offer a military discount!"}
{"text":"Wasn't that great as expected. Food was bland (some seasoning would be nice) & their bacon looked aged & gross... only thing I enjoyed was the single crepe with Nutella & bananas. Overall an ok experience, nothing to hype about."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and brunch place -HANDS DOWN!!! Love the ambiance and friendly wait staff here. LOVE the FOOD!! Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"My daughter just loves this place and finally got me to come along and check them out.  She has eaten at one of the other locations and was excited that they were finally opening one near our house.  We arrived in the early AM and were able to be seated right away.  When we left there was a wait list to get in - timing is everything!    
   We ordered the Banana Foster Pancakes, Loco Moco with Garlic Rice and Cinnabon Pancakes.  The Banana Foster Pancakes were delicious.  The sauce, bananas and whip cream made for an amazing combination.   The pancakes were light and fluffy and I was in foodie zen.  I got to try my daughters Cinnabon pancakes and to me they were better than an actual Cinnabon.  Light and fully and super delicious.  We shared the Loco Moco which was really good.  The Garlic rice which is an add on was delicious.  
    The inside is bright, roomy and well decorated.  The service was perfect and we were definitely well taken care of.  This was one place that really impressed me as I could never make delicious pancakes like they do.  If you love pancakes then you need to try Babystacks as they will satisfy your pancake craving with flair!"}
{"text":"Today is National Pancake Day...naturally I had to celebrate properly.

I can't see why any one would grant this place anything less than 5 stars.  I have been countless times and have never left unsatisfied. 

The signature Red Velvet pancakes will bring more meaning to your life. They come out sprinkled with a chocolate crumble, slightly melted whip cream and a side of cream cheese syrup.  You may think the short stack won't be enough, but it is PLENTY.  Only order the full if you plan on sharing (prices are more than reasonable btw.) 

The Lemon Crepes, and the smore's pancakes are a couple others I've tried.  If you're indecisive, this place might stress you out but just know -- everything is delicious.  I usually order seasoned potatoes to go with the sweet portion of the meal, because you can't have sweet without salty :P 

The service is always bomb too and the place has never felt dirty. 

If they added a brunch Mimosa special -- I would probably be there every weekend (and weigh 20 lbs more.)"}
{"text":"The best place to have breakfast in Vegas! You have to come early though because there is almost always a huge wait! The food is so delicious and addicting. My boyfriend and I come and share the piggy omelet, country Benedict, and a stack of red velvet pancakes! When we leave we can barely move but the food coma is so worth it! The service is just amazing as the food an all around great place!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the country fried steak and it tasted artificial. The service was awful coffee tasted old and watery and it took forever to take our order and for them to bring our good. My boyfriend ordered the omelette fried rice it was okay. We also got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes they were good... the only thing good about this place were the pancakes."}
{"text":"A great excuse to get off the Strip! We've been wanting to try Loco Moco ($9) for a long time and finally got the chance. It was good, but the burger patties were a bit lacking. Looking forward to trying to make my own version at home.The pancakes are of course the real reason to come! Hubby upgraded the side to Red Velvet Pancakes for an extra $2 and loved them.

I got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes ($8) and they were delicious. I added a side of strawberries and whipped cream ($2.50) to go with them and they really made the lemon flavor pop. Turned my 4-star pancakes into a 5-star dish!
It's a small spot but the food came quickly and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's even more awesome because it's located near ME! Since it just opened up, there was no wait. It's about the same size as the other location. The service was fast as well!! And the tables were almost filled up too so I was surprised that the food came out so quickly. 

The food was the same quality as their other location.

The red velvet pancakes: chocolately red fluffiness with a dollop of sweet whip cream and chocolate. That cream cheese frosting is not overly sweet  (to me) so it went well with the pancakes.

My other favorite: adobo fried rice omelet. Goshdamn, it's good. The rice was highlighted with pork adobo and wrapped in a thin scrambled egg. 

Le sigh. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for weeks, so since I was in the area at lunchtime today, I said why not? I like having \"breakfast\" for lunch or even for dinner, so I ordered an omelette and pancakes. The \"Piglet\" omelette contained bacon, ham, and sausage with cheddar cheese on top. Now I don't mind a little browning on my eggs, but this was way too overdone for my taste and none too fluffy. And I could say the same for the pancakes. I like my pancakes golden yellow. These were charred brown and flat as.....well, as a pancake! The hazelnut Nutella drizzled over the top and the huge scoop of whipped cream were good but somehow I missed having syrup.....maybe hazelnut syrup? At least the service was excellent. Friendly servers, always checking on you. I never give up on a restaurant after only one try, so I will go back and order something different."}
{"text":"Not that great it was not worth the price service was bad I got the pancakes not good at all weirs cause I heard good things will never come here again"}
{"text":"I love this place. I may be a little biased but this is my spot for breakfast. You can never get enough of the red velvet pancakes and even if you just want steak and eggs it's still so good. Be warned it gets so packed but this one is very worth it."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and noticed they had Loco Moco on their menu, I love Loco Moco!!! (hamburger above rice, egg, and smothered in gravy) and it was disgusting. It honestly tasted like powdered eggs, over hard rice and an AMPM frozen burger patty. They skimped on the gravy and it wasn't the right type of gravy. If you're going to offer it on the menu then cook it right. We also got pancakes eggs and bacon and that came out decent. Still waiting for a exceptional breakfast spot in the area"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for breakfast when we are lazy. The Wife & Kids get there sweet tooth fix and I get my Hawaiian fix on! Garlic rice is an awesome option!"}
{"text":"Baby stacks very simply put is inconsistent. But, when they are good, they are GOOD. 

There isn't a lot of seating and the seating they do have is sorta squished together. They have a bar top which I enjoy eating at and watching tv. Well lit and always smells good.

The menu is a great size and very easy to understand. I have only been there for breakfast. I have gotten the piglet omelet and buttermilk pancakes the times I've been there. The first time I went they were fantastic. The omelet had lots of meat and was a good thick omelet. The pancakes were decent at best (but I don't care for pancakes usually). The second time I went I order the same thing and there wasn't hardly any meat in the omelet and it was a bit runny. I took 2 bites of the pancakes. One was off the side and was hard, I moved to the middle thinking it would be softer but I was wrong. I got my check and left thinking I'd never be back. About a month later my mom wanted to go because someone had recommended it to her so I figured I'd give it another chance. This time was just like my first experience. The omelet was great and the cakes....again....decent. My mom got blueberry pancakes which I tried and wasn't really a fan of, the blueberries were really sour and just ruined the cake. I've never had bad service just bad food. I never thought the prices were unreasonable either. 

I'd suggest this place for breakfast, and if it's not good, give it one more chance.

Also, I liked that they had the local zip code magazine."}
{"text":"I love it here! I love their food because its not an ordinary breakfast joint. It has an island style food and also they have many variety of pancakes! i've only tried the red velvet and the banana cream pie and they were both so DELICIOUS. The workers were so pleasant and nice. I'm definitely going back as much as i can."}
{"text":"There are so many breakfast places in town recently and not all of them met up to my expectations, sadly including this. Baby Stacks caught my attention since it's close to my house and have good ratings. This is a small joint and when we came here, it was packed. We had to wait for 20 minutes to get seated. 

There were so many options on their menu (Hawaiian and Filipino cuisine too) and they all sounded so good. I ordered Cora's Corned Beef Hash with garlic rice and a side of Banana Cream Pie pancake. My bf ordered a full size Banana Cream Pie pancake (ordered this since we saw a lot of people raving about it) with Portuguese sausage on the side. 

Corned beef hash was good but the garlic rice was a disappointment. It had more onions than garlic. I hardly tasted any garlic in it. My banana cream pie pancake was good at first until I came across some uncooked batter at the bottom. 

My bf didn't like the banana cream pie pancake since it was too dense for him. We both like fluffy pancakes. The Portuguese sausage was very good but it tasted like the ones we buy packed at the grocery store. It was not made in-house.

Maybe next time we will try something else if we ever come back."}
{"text":"We have been to many breakfast places when we come to Vegas.  We finally got to squeeze in Babystacks and everything was amazing!  The omelet were great with crispy hash browns.  But the bananas foster pancakes were on my god, to die for.  Service was great and we are looking forward to coming back when we are in town next time."}
{"text":"This place has everything I love! The service is super friendly, the food is always consistently delicious (Rick's Adobo Fried Rice!!!), not to mention the creative selection of pancakes (Cookies & Cream, Red Velvet, & Cinnabun... Yes please!). One of my favorite spots right now."}
{"text":"I really love the food here and that's even when I don't get the fancy pancakes.  Benedicts here are great, even the omelets are good.  I'm a big coffee fan and it's always fresh and hot.

It's a very small place so come early, call ahead or be prepared to wait.  It's worth it though.  The small space lends to attentive service and the staff is friendly.  Get here and stuff yo face!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are delish! Coffee is great too! The husband approves and that says a lot. We have tried the macadamia, lemon ricotta, banana and regular buttermilk - all so yummy!"}
{"text":"I got married in Las Vegas last week. My Aunt from California said,\" before we leave We have to eat at Baby Stacks. They have all kinds of pancakes. I want red velvet.\"
  We went and not only did they have a large section of interesting pancakes. They had grear variations of local Hawaiian dishes Portuguese sausage and eggs, kalua pork dishes. Everyone was very happy with their meal. Yes, my Aunt got her red velvet pancakes, I had nutella pancakes, my new husband got orange creamscicle pancakes. 
  We have to go back tomorrow. Now, I'm saying we have to stop there before we leave Las Vegas.
   The service is very good and quick. They wouldn't seat us until we were all there. I understand that.
It was quite busy for a Wed. Morning."}
{"text":"Gerrardo was attentive and got our order perfect.  The strawberry pancakes are unbelievable and I don't even really like pancakes.  My son loved the Nutella crepes.  I didn't try them because I hate Nutella.  We ate a lot of food and it was only $40 for 3 of us with drinks.  The only cons are it is far from the strip and it seems you have to get lucky not to wait too long.  Anytime I am in Vegas on a weekday I would check it out again."}
{"text":"Food was average. Why I'm rating so low was due to the customer service. First of all, we were patient to wait almost an hour after the person at the front desk said the wait was about 25 minutes. Then I notice people were getting seated before us after they were on the wait list after us??? We finally get seated and then the server took awhile to take our order. We had to wave to somebody that we were ready. The server still took time. Finally, after 30 minutes, I notice people that came after us got their food before us. WTF!!!! Horrible service!!! You don't treat your customers that way. It was like we were invisible at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and this place does it the best! This place is always packed by 10 am on the weekends. One time we had to go someplace else for breakfast because it would have been a 40 min wait. I'd say it's worth the wait, but eat a snack before hand! 

I went here with a friend and got the Cowboy omelet which was amazing. The eggs were cooked just right without being too dry. The cheese was melted perfectly and everything inside the omelet was cooked well. I also got a side of the red velvet pancakes which took longer to come out. It was worth the wait though because once it came out, I couldn't put the fork down! I looove red velvet and these pancakes lives up to its name. It was soft and fluffy and not too sweet. I was given a side of sweet cream cheese glaze which wasn't overpoweringly sweet like some can be. 

Our waiter was very friendly and would keep me updated on my pancakes to let me know that I'm not forgotten. She was very patient with us as we kept asking for a couple of minutes to think about our order as well as catching up. She also knew the menu well and suggested some of her favorites as well as customer's top choices. The restaurant itself felt like most breakfast places, which makes it feel homey. 

I will definitely plan to come back when I visit Vegas! I really want to try their Hawaiian dishes."}
{"text":"Can you say yum?! 

My husband I went to baby stacks without high expectations, but boy did they deliver! 

We ordered the adobo fried rice omelette, corned beef hash with rice and eggs and bananas fosters pancakes. It was all delish!  Especially the omelette!  That definitely caught me by surprised! It was extremely flavorful, without being too over powering.  The pancakes however, were not 

The service however, was mediocre at best.  We had to wait when we asked for refills for our water. And it took awhile to ask for our check because we couldn't find our waiter."}
{"text":"Best thing to get here is their pancakes. The loco moco and adobe fried rice are ok, but after awhile it's just whatever. You can get better of both items in California maybe possibly even Utah. Idk about loco moco in Utah though. 

So, since I've been living in Utah for awhile my pancake comparison and palate is going to be in reference to them. The pancake here is light and moist. I'm not a fan of the dense pancake. I do like all their different options. Ive tried the lemon ricotta and banana foster. If you like a more crepe like style and more eggy type of pancake then I would get the lemon ricotta. If you want something a little sweeter, I would get the banana foster. 

The next time, I come here I would just stick to the pancakes. I would leave the adobo fried rice to the filipino restaurants and hamburg steak/ loco moco to the japanese places."}
{"text":"Great prices and better food. We, my wife and I and our three kids, had the following: lemon-ricotta pancakes, red velvet pancakes, cookie butter waffles, strawberry sweet cream crepe, adobo fried rice and ranchero skillet. I tried everything and it was all so good. The lemon-ricotta pancakes were the best thing on the table and I could eat 50 of them and not get sick of them. They come with a lemon syrup which is more like a thinned down lemon curd pie filling. Mouth is watering just thinking about them, now, about an hour after brunch and still very full. Wait staff was great and the 25 minutes we waited for New Year's Day brunch went by quick in the busy and quaint restaurant; but, then again, any wait would be worth it for this delicious breakfast spot.

Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Love the variety of pancakes options  bananas and cream is my children and I favorite . They have one of the best flavor of biscuits and gravy I've had around town !!!"}
{"text":"****Watch your Food*** This place generates a lot of business, and I was looking forward to a great experience... Until The waiter came out n brought me my plate w/hair in my eggs! Yes hair!!! And when I brought it to his attention he then asks me do I want him to take the food back?!!! WTH!!! The German Chocolate Pancakes were Awesome! But The Customer Service Needs Serious Work!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of six at babystacks today. The group ordered several different types of pancakes. Everyone raved about his or her pancakes. The fresh fruit cups were just that \"fresh & very tasty \" the omelette one person had was very good and the other was slightly dry. Coffee & ice tea were also good! The service we received was prompt, friendly & very warm. We will certainly patronize this place again!"}
{"text":"Slow service, ran out of rice....crowded.....Im not sure what the fuss is about.  My wife who raved about this place was mad as hell at the service....Never going again"}
{"text":"Can't really order anything wrong.  Service  is good, Huevos rancheros were great, baby stacks were great."}
{"text":"Updated review:

We have been back a few times and this place has gotten worse. Very poor customer service, hardly can get acknowledged even when it's not busy. After getting seated, we've waited 10 minutes to order drinks and another 10 minutes to receive the drinks. Food has gone downhill. Overly salty and burned corned beef, runny scrambled eggs, peanut butter pancakes that don't taste anything like peanut butter, and for some reason the water tastes weird. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"If you're visiting the strip and have a car, take a short drive to this cafe for breakfast. Prices aren't hyper inflated like the strip, and they have some unique options. I had the kalua pork eggs benedict, which was pretty tasty if you like smoked pork. And you can't go wrong with hash browns. The pancake selection is overwhelming! We loved the red velvet. The cream cheese syrup is perfect. I'm excited to come back to try the country benedict and the cookie butter french toast.

One thing I tried but wasn't crazy about was the s'mores pancakes. The whole unmelted marshmallows on top were obtrusive, and the crust crumbles on top didn't taste right. I'd rather see graham crackers incorporated in the batter with lots of chocolate chips, and marshmallow cream on top.

That aside, I thought it was a nice little diner with plenty of interesting delicious food to try. A great break from the strip."}
{"text":"Love this place !!!!!  Very homey feel to this restaurant !!!  RED VELVET PANCAKES w/ The Cream Cheese syrup !!!!!  YUMMO!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten breakfast here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed both visits.  One time was without kids and one time was with kids, and both times had great food.  The pancake menu is so extensive and unique, the coffee is good, and the eggs are always cooked to perfection.  My husband has asked for the oatmeal on both visits and both times was told it wasn't available, so that was a bummer.  But, you don't go to a pancake place to eat oatmeal, anyway.  The wait can get long so the earlier the better.  They do not split checks for group dining so be prepared to have everyone pay cash."}
{"text":"Earlier today I was in Henderson. I didn't want to drive back on my side of town to get to baby stacks(buffalo and flamingo). So I had a 'oh what the heck' attitude and went to this baby stacks. 

Why did I rate 1 star? I was very disappointed in this baby stacks. My girlfriend and I ordered 2 full stacks of pancakes. We waited ALMOST 40 MINUTES for our order to come thru. What made me really mad is that we didn't even get any compensation. Like a discount or even free side dishes like hash browns. Even before we could order, our waiter didn't even greet us nor take our order in a timely manner. So after 40 minutes of waiting we finally got our meal. The pancakes tasted bland and they were also burnt. At this point I didn't want to make a scene. So I forcefully ate my burnt pancakes and wanted to leave. 

Never again will I ever go to this location. And to be honest, I feel like this place is just hype. Some of the prices for food are just ridiculous for the amount of food you get. I feel like most of the food they serve, you can make at home... Let's be real. For the amount of food they give you, quality of the food, bad service, do you really want to spend your hard earned money here?"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food is mediocre and not worth the hype. Staff was not very attentive and I felt it lacked a supervisor when we went."}
{"text":"I can never be happy at iHOP again, now I know what a great pancake-place should be like.

So many choices! and everything was yummy. We had red velvet pancakes, omelette and coffee with hash browns and toast on side. The quantity and happy service are both great. 

Too bad it's so far away :("}
{"text":"Please make gluten free options!  I've heard such amazing things about this place but we can't eat there due to allergies.  :("}
{"text":"way too many rules and regulations.... big sign on door, no outside beverages, there goes my $4.-- cup of Starbucks, very small dining area, who serves cheap margarine with their pancakes,?  nice service though. too trendy, too expensive, small helpings.  fuddy duddy, serves cheap margarine with their pancakes.   They have horrible tasting weak coffee, everything is an extra charge.   Way too expensive hole in the wall...way too many Rules & Regulations, don't do this, don't do that, no spilt checks, no outside beverages, no incomplete parties, no spillting tables, etc. etc.no Discover Cards, No Checks, give me a break.go back to Calif."}
{"text":"Awesome food, Rick's fried rice is a must have.  Same for the red velvet pancakes.  It's worth the long wait, better yet, just get here early.  Friendly service, too.  1,000th reviewer!"}
{"text":"Love it Customer service is on point food is amazing I would definitely recommend this place to anyone the loves breakfast"}
{"text":"I came to this location to meet up with some friends. I found out this is their original location. The food at this location is way better. I got the chicken adobo omelette and there was bigger pieces of meat in the omelette.

We also got the pancakes and it tasted good."}
{"text":"I was craving some local food so when we were in town and I knew I had to stop in. I ordered take out because I didn't want to wait in the long line and we had to get back to the hotel. Didn't take long for the food to be ready and they were super nice and friendly on the oboe and at the counter. They opened up each package so you can make sure that the order was right. All the utinsils were in the bag which is a plus. My daughter for the strawberry pancake. The strawberry and whip cream on the side to make sure the pancakes stayed firm. It tastes like the sauce was homemade. I got the adobo fried rice. Enough to feed two people. 

If you're craving local food this is the place to go. Be prepared for long waits depending on the time you go. The wait is worth it. You can always order takeout if you want to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"I saw this place many times. Always had tons of people waiting outside to be seated. In my mind I'm thinking why is everyone waiting for pancakes???until I was told that they make more than that. I grew up in Japan and in Hawaii and pancakes is not my norm for breakfast food. Someone said they had adobo omelet. Say what??? Local food right down the street from me?  How come I didn't hear about this place before??? I came just before it got crowded and ordered the adobo omelet. Yummy!!!!!! Just like back home! Huge too!!! I could only eat half of it and that was pushing it. I could of stopped a few bites before but it tasted so good. I will definitely be back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"So good. They have a big selection of unique pancakes and Hawaiian themed breakfast items. Big portions of food. Always on my list of places to come when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The place was good although they made us wait a while even though they had a sign saying first come first serve...didnt make sense that once u leave and decide not to stay n wait  but other people come in and wait the whole time the people that wait that long dont get priority over the people that change there mind n decided to come back anyways also i didnt like that we were sat by the kitchen almostvn bathrom but price was reasonable probably wont come bk"}
{"text":"I ordered to go and the food was hot and ready when I arrived. I got the adobo fried rice omelet and the oh-so popular red velvet  pancakes. Now I see why it is so popular!  It comes with this this bomb cream cheese syrup and is sprinkled with chocolate shavings and a nice heaping of whipped cream! Jesus lives in those red velvet pancakes!!! They have so many specialty pancakes I'm dying to go back and try some new ones. Next time I will def dine in."}
{"text":"I recently just moved to Henderson and very happy that I came across this cute breakfast place! 
Expect a wait, especially if your party is larger than 4 since it is a small place.
They're known for their fluffy variety of pancakes, red velvet being their signature. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes, red velvet, and plain buttermilk. If this sounds like too much, it was and they were all short stacks! Definitely come in sharing the pancakes if you want to have your own sampler. My favorite pancakes were the chocolate chip. It didn't even need syrup because the chips had it sweetened enough for me. The red velvet cakes had its own cream cheese syrup which was pretty good. The plain buttermilk pancakes were nice and simple. They didn't have that baking powder/soda taste that I am usually able to taste whenever I eat pancakes.
I also ordered the adobo fried rice which was so good and reminded me of home! The fried rice was wrapped in a blanket of egg and scallions.

Service here is excellent! Everyone is very accommodating and while I was there they offered to make and changes if there was anything wrong with the food.
I can't wait to take visitors from home to try out this place!"}
{"text":"My go to is the Adobo fried rice which comes out in a monster 6 egg omelette! Folded around the delicious fried rice and it comes with a side of pancakes, which I upgrade to the red velvet flavor which is the perfect little dessert at the end of eating that savory omelette. Another favorite of mine is the loco moco add you must upgrade to the garlic rice with this dish. Elevates the flavor to a whole new level!"}
{"text":"Place is consistent with great quality breakfast eats. I love the fried rice and red velvet pancakes. Top it off with a cup of coffee and your ready for the day!"}
{"text":"I love the Adobe fried rice omlete with a stack of red velvet pancakes. The pancakes are nice and fluffy and come out with a side of delicious cream cheese sauce that pairs nicely with a hot cup of coffee. I also really enjoy the loco moco with an over easy egg on top, this dish is a meal that will stick to your ribs and leave you satisfied for much of the day if your grabbing brunch or breakfast. The line can get a bit long on weekends so get get in early!"}
{"text":"Oh goodness... The wait! This little place is ALWAYS busy. But you've been forewarned. This little restaurant is clean and very well kept. The staff is friendly, that's always a plus. 

The food is great! It never disappoints. I recommend the rancheros omelette. A bit on the spicy side, but I LOVE it. I also had a side of white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes... YUM! 

Again, there's a wait... But it's definitely worth it. Staff will tend to all of your needs, refill your drinks ASAP, and you'll enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Loco moco is delicious. Standard ground beef patty over rice with two runny eggs smothered in gravy. Throw a little bit of hot sauce on it and it will cure that craving. We also had the kalua pig benedict. It was decent but I wouldn't recommend it. The kalua pig could've had a bit more flavor. It was slightly bland in my opinion. Overall we enjoyed our meal and the take-out person in the phone was very nice and helpful. They were really busy when I got in but they still got my order out pretty quick. We'll be back when the craving for Hawaiian food comes around in a month or so."}
{"text":"Im giong to have to follow up with this review and say the pancakes are still the most delicious i have ever had. Great spot for hawaiian breakfast. I dont find the food to be that great but the pancakes and the fact that they serve rice."}
{"text":"Second time here, Oct 2011. First time was Nov 2010. Food is good, service is a mixed bag, cleanliness is lacking. A quick trip to the washroom ruined my breakfast- couldn't clear the stench of months old urine out of my nose- makes me wonder if the whole place is maintained this poorly."}
{"text":"Weekdays are the days to eat here.  They're too popular on weekends.  Hey now though... Eggs Benedict menu!  Yyyeeeaahh-uh.  Gimme gimme!  Super glad Ness and I finally got to grubbit.  Way better than the other place down the street, in my opinion.  I'll tell ya' only if you ask.

Jacob stay awesome!  You've got the smiley service.  Thanks for keeping my hot coffee topped off.  We got our beverages within a couple minutes of being seated.  After ordering, food didn't take longer than 10 minutes to be served.

Wow the menu!  Can we order everything please?  Except we'll be extremely food baby'd...  Had us giggling about why we can't order 2 nutella crepes which would've been perfect.  Nooo sawwy chawlie it's one or three.  Yummyyyy :D all that's missing is ice cream!  Get it!

Approving and recommending their Hawaiian (spam) and / or Spinach (has mushrooms) Benedict plates.  Comes with two, plus potatoes served different styles.  Dousing the Cholula!  NOM-awesome!  The English muffins under the ingredients were not soggy oil sponges at all.  Loved that they were still fluffy with a slight crisp :)  They got it right! 

Babystacks has a great menu, appetizing food presentation, good prices, clean dining area, great customer service, music and TV.  Billing receipt presents tip suggestions between 15% to 20%.  We have nothing to complain about.  You've made part of our day!"}
{"text":"I have been to the baby stacks on the other side of town and absolutely loved the red velvet pancakes.  My family was in town so I told them I would have to take them here.  The service at this location was top notch.   We had a very tall thin girl with reddish hair who was outstanding and I am a huge critic to service.

This location is not as busy as the others either which is nice.  They ensured my coffee was never empty and the food was absolutely amazing.  My family from out of town said it was one of the best breakfasts they've had!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about BabyStacks so when I was in town for Christmas I had to check it out. They wait was long because there were a ton of people there. We actually got seated faster than they said it would take. I personally don't care if there is a long wait. A long wait means there are tons of people that want to eat there and I understand why. If you complain about a wait at a restaurant you are the same kind of person who thinks traffic is a personal attack on you. Wow I'm preachy.

The food is excellent. Everything we ordered was great. I can tell they care about making good quality food with real ingredients. There is no comparison between a place like this and some chain restaurant. 

Lets talk about the food! I ordered the breakfast burrito and the carrot cake pancakes. Holy hot damn were those pancakes good. The breakfast burrito was also great, I ordered it with the sausage (I think its Peruvian sausage or something, I can't remember). My gf ordered the Two eggs and bacon with the red velvet pancakes. It really is like having cake for breakfast. They are amazing, I get why they red velvet pancakes are so popular.

That's it! Go here and eat food you jerk!"}
{"text":"We love it here! I had to go all out and try the S'mores pancakes and they were quite a treat. Timely, attentive and very nice. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"1st visit very friendly staff...fast service. Food is another story...I had the chicken fried steak...small portion, dry and gravy was thin with no taste. Potatoes lacked taste. Friends food also lacked taste. I give the food two stars. I will give second chance because staff was on top of things...maybe just a bad day for the cook, will try again."}
{"text":"I've eaten at their other location on Smoke Ranch, it was fine. This place was so disorganized it's hard to believe they're still in business! We were the only customers in the place, it took 10 minutes to get a water, milk and tea. We ordered 2 hamburgers and one breakfast. One hamburger and the breakfast came out, it took about 8 minutes to get the second burger, which was very mediocre. .???  What's going on in their kitchen? Later in the day, I got sick from the food. Cross contamination is my guess. Go elsewhere. This place does not have their act together."}
{"text":"YUM! Just yum. 

Their bananas foster pancakes are so BOMB. The fries are great, the omlettes are awesome. Everything was fresh and really good. 

The seating a slightly uncomfortable but that's really my only complaint. I like a breakfast place with a little more comfort to soothe my hangover (which is really the only reason I'll ever go out for a big breakfast! Haha)

Can't wait for my next hangover so I can make a trip back!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some good pancakes so I Googled best places and Babystacks came up. Decided to try based on photos and reviews. I had the Kalbibi breakfast plate that came with pancakes and the option to upgrade to specialty pancakes for an extra charge. The Kalbibi plate with the eggs and garlic fried rice (also a up charge) was ok, the meat could have been a little more tender. The blueberry pancakes were not good at all, as one reviewer stated.  I would try this place again but will never try the pancakes again."}
{"text":"I really like this place, I always get the Ranchero skillet. I love the green salsa, it is a very delicious and filling breakfast."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are absolutely delicious and I am very picky with my red velvet. Not very many people can pull it off. Their turkey avocado sandwich is hit or miss. I order it every time we dine in, and every other time it has been an amazing experience; on the other days not so much. Once it was salty but drinking water really helped. The other time my bread was really toasted (burnt is just too harsh a description) but our server noticed that I removed it and immediately went to the manager to see if there was any way to remove it or give us a discount. Did I mention, we didn't complain about it? Now that is great customer service! Sorry, I didn't get your name though."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Babystacks. The venue is small and the tables are close to each other.  Be prepared to wait a little if you go on a weekend. I had Rick's Adobo Fried Rice made with egg whites and cinnamon roll baby stack. They were both phenomenal! No doubt they were some of the best pancakes I ever had. The server was very nice and checked on us regularly. I'll definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"An amazing variety of specialty pancakes and Hawaiian inspired breakfast dishes. Decent prices with fast, friendly service. My go-to breakfast spot with 3 different locations!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes, wow! There are a variety of other pancakes to try, but this one instantly caught my eye. It is also the first pancake listed on the menu, so it must be their signature item. The red velvet pancakes were so delightfully sweet and tasty that no syrup was needed. The combination of the oozing butter, the melted chocolate crumbles, and the whipped cream  added up to some of the best pancakes I've ever tasted. 

i also ordered the Adobo Fried Rice which also comes with a small macaroni salad. They wrap the rice in an egg, resembling an omurice. I think they added too much soy sauce to my rice, because it was quite salty. 

Friendly service and atmosphere. If I ever have a craving for pancakes here in Vegas, I definitely know where to go :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  It was moderately busy.  We were sat right away and a busser came to our table for our drink order within a minute.  

It took a bit longer to get our food order though.   10 minutes to be exact.  I tried making eye contact with either of the two servers with no success.  I wasn't even sure who our server was.  

Finally our server came, apologized for the wait and took our order.  She was sweet.

My son ordered the full order of red velvet pancakes.  Delicious.  The best pancake in Vegas.  

I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich.  I usually order this slightly spicy sandwich that is really tasty.  

This time, however, the sandwich was flavorless.  After 2-3 bites, I opened the sandwich and the chicken filet didn't look blackened.  I showed it to our server and she agreed that it didn't look right.  She apologized and took the plate.  

It took about 10-12 minutes to get the replacement sandwich.  My son was already done with his meal.  The sandwich was tasty but I had kind of lost my appetite.  I gave half to my son and ate the other half.  

Now here is what disappointed me.  I would have thought that the server would've offered to pay for my soda...offer a little dessert...something.   By all accounts, this was not a good dining experience.  Nothing.  

I suppose I could've been a jerk.  Maybe that would've been more effective?"}
{"text":"We've been going to their location on Buffalo & Smoke Ranch since they opened...when they were called Baby Cakes.  I know they are always busy and they won't miss our business, but we won't be returning to any of their locations. 

We went to our normal Babystacks on Buffalo & Smoke Ranch, but the wait was 35-40 minutes.  Despite being 15 minutes away, we called the location on Buffalo & Flamingo and asked how long the wait was.  The lady asked how many people and I said 5 people.  She answered \"15-20 minutes.\"  I asked if she should could write our name down but she said no.  I explained that I was at their other location but the wait was too long, and I explained that we were driving straight over.  She still said no.  

I understand that restaurants have their policies.  But I'm a business owner and I am a believer that customer loyalty and customer service trumps policies at time.  

We ended up driving over to the Buffalo/Flamingo location and by the time we got there, the wait was 40 minutes.  

I was so disgusted that we took our business to Hash House Go Go and had a great breakfast."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of pancakes you NEED to get to BabyStacks! The best I've ever had at a restaurant. Many different flavors from your basic blueberry to the amazing Orange Creamsicle!"}
{"text":"So far, my review is not good of this restaurant.  I have not actually eaten here because we went there last weekend intending to have a nice brunch and the wait was 40 minutes!  OK, it's a small place a 40 minute wait is somewhat expected, but then they told us they would not have any high chairs available for our 17 month old twins.  That is not acceptable.  They only have two high chairs for the whole place and both would be in use.  IMO, a pancake place should be much more kid friendly than this is.  I still want to try it sometime, but am definitely not impressed so far.  Oh, and the hostess was less than helpful/compassionate."}
{"text":"Flew into Vegas and my Cal pal suggested we have brunch at BabyStacks Cafe. What's this place? Yummy, delicious breakfast food! I had the Nutella Crepes with half strawberries and banana with fresh whip cream with a side of Canadian bacon, and my friend ordered the Honey Toast with a side of turkey bacon. My crepes were not thin, more pancake-like rolled into what looked like a crepe, and my Canadian bacon was way too salty. However, Katrina's breakfast was to DIE for!!!! The honey toast, or (aka French Toast) were two humongous thick slices of sweet bread with a large dollop of whip cream sprinkled with cinnamon. I actually wanted to eat her breakfast instead of mine! LOL The portions were large and hearty. Their overall menu selections were abundant, from pancakes, crepes, omelets, eggs/bacon, lots of sides, and a few Filipino dishes.

I decided to take my family there before we left Vegas, so my second trip was just as good as the first. This time I ordered the Honey Toast (delectable!) and my family ordered: red velvet pancakes, strawberries and cream pancakes, and corned beef hash with garlic rice and an over easy egg. The garlic rice was so-so as they put too many onion slices in it. Be prepared to order a full or half stack of pancakes if you're hungry and a sweet tooth.

In terms of service, we arrived at a busy time, around 11:00 AM so we had to wait 15-20 minutes before we were seated. The waitress was very pleasant and replenished our coffee mugs. The restaurant is small and gets very busy, so if you go, go early. Their hours are Mon-Fri 7:00 AM - 2:00 PM, and Sat-Sun 7-3PM. Their prices are a bit steep, but makes up for the quality of the fresh food. You must eat there!"}
{"text":"This place is one of THE BEST brunch places you can go to. So glad they built the one on Blue Diamond which is closer to me. Everything is so delicious. They're pancakes are way better than Stacks n Yolks and I feel they have a bigger selection. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so ono (delicious...I'm from Hawai'i) One of my favorites, as well as Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice."}
{"text":"There is no need to go anywhere else for breakfast, it's inexpensive & delicious. The only downside is that there is usually a wait so I'm hoping they could start expanding soon. But that's only because it kind of turns into a habit after the first time."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes and white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes are amazing.  There are so many options!!!  Try the adobo fried rice omelette and add pancakes of your choice.   Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is a must breakfast stop for us whenever we are in Vegas. There are two locations, both on the same street if that is confusing enough! 

Came here by 9 and there is already a line. Thats pretty normal here to be busy so expect a slight wait if you have parties of more than four. 

Lets get to the must orders:
Pancakes
- Red Velvet (if you like it, not my favorite but a guest favorite, get sauce on side if you don't like things too sweet)
- Banana cream Pie - LOVE IT, but I always get the sauce on the side since its too much for me
- Chocolate Chip - LOVE IT
Crepes
-Solid Choice, but you can also get at buffets so, usually I pass on this one
Adobo Fried Rice Omelette - Delicious! Must try
Loco Moco - Good gravy, not as good as in hawaii, but you can add garlic rice here which I recommend!

They also have usual breakfast items like Ham, bacon, corned beef hash, etc. These are all not bad items, but also you can also get them anywhere and they do a find job of making these dishes. I only talked about the ones above because they're my favorites and you can't get at too many other places.

The plan of attack is to SHARE a shortstack and something else, unless your meal already comes with pancakes, in which UPGRADE them to your liking."}
{"text":"I love their food ideas. There menu is a foodies paradise but execution is poor. needs a lot of refinement. More trials and errors. location is very convenient for my family and I'm a big fan of breakfast food but I'll let them workout their kinks. Let the cooks get familiar with the menu items..etc. 
Definitely worthy of another visit but would like to enjoy a dish to it's full potential."}
{"text":"We've been to one of their locations before while visiting family. While googling places to go while in Vegas this time, we decided to come here again. They did not disappoint! I got their special - Lolo's Special Adobo Fried Rice Omelet. It was delicious!! I also loved their orange creamsicle pancakes!  We also got their Nutella crepes with bananas, build your own omelets and strawberry pancakes! Everything we had was so GOOD!!! Definitely a place we will come to visit every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh man I don't know why we haven't tried this place a lot sooner! I got the red velvet pancakes and they were fantastic! Our son got a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes and he loved them (the whipped cream tastes homemade and was his favorite part). My husband got the adobo fried rice omelette and a short stack of the cinnamon bun pancakes & he was very impressed. Our food came out quick and fresh. Can't wait to come back and try the Eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"After a 30 minute wait . The service was good. Food was very good as well. Did my special order with no negative comments. Food was fresh and very tasty. My only negative comment us they need a bigger restaurant! I noticed while I was waiting lots if people left cause of the wait time.Heard a few people say its too crowded once you get seated too. This wa the location on Blue Diamond not sure if Or her ones."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great variety of different types of pancakes as well as other breakfast options."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, can get busy on a weekend morning. The service was excellent, coffee was decent, pancakes were on point. 

I got the banana pancakes, and have no complaints. I'd make my way back to try some of their more sweet/sugary stacks whenever I feel like going into a diabetic coma."}
{"text":"My Ratings:
Quantity: 4 - Good
Quality: 4 - yum!
Price: 4 - just right
Location: 4 - cute but small
Parking: 4 - parking lot
Service: 4 - Friendly and nice
Speed: 4 - Pretty good

Overall: Good food! Recommended for all! I would go back for more.

My Opinion/Story:
I got the groupon special and prepared myself for when I go to Vegas. I had an agenda to check this place out and I was happy to have made it here.

Of course I got their red velvet pancakes but as good as it sounds, it wasn't enough for me. We got two medium size pancakes and it made me crave for more.  Thank goodness I ordered an omelette and another got their White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes. Now that was delicious. I guess I like all the ingredients in that one.  Hubby got their Adobo Omelette which was different but also good.

Service was good, friendly, quick. I like this place."}
{"text":"3rd time here   The previous 2 were a lot better.  Ordered theportugeuese sausage and pancakes.  The eggs I ordered had a hair in it.  The orange slice in the side seemed like it was a sun dried orange.  Side of rice ordered was barely a spoonful.  Server forgot my request and I had to walk back and ask again.  I've been here before and it was great then but now not so good."}
{"text":"First let's start with the place being not so clean. Filth coming down the TV, Air Vents, and tile that goes around the floor. The butterfly's that are on the wall are covered with dust. All that is needed is a quick clean. But the food is great and so is the service. So please guys clean the place up...."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Ken's pancake house back in Hawaii, with many pancake choices and Hawaiian food here and there. This new location has a shorter wait than the original store on weekends and it's much roomier so I prefer this store. 

I was the one who wanted to go here, but my friend who has a sweet tooth started getting more excited than me as he perused the menu. No surprise since the pancakes sound more like desserts than breakfast food. We ordered a few to try - red velvet tastes like dessert with marshmallow whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, while white chocolate and the others taste just like normal pancakes with fancy toppings. Also, the kalua pig benedict didn't taste like normal kalua pig so I wouldn't recommend it. 

Stick with the red velvet pancake here. Expect it to taste like dessert. And a short stack is more than enough for two people, trust me."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Super coffee. (seattles best) And great service. Love my new friends here! This is my new fave. I had the Banana Creme pancakes. To die for!  There is not one place in town you can go to eat breakfast and get great coffee at the same time. Ask my husband, he gets tired of having to go to the coffee place everytime after we leave a breakfast place. We have been so dissapointed with Omelette house since I got food poisoning. Egg Works isn't worth the prices. And Egg and I is so far away from us. This is the new hangout for sure!"}
{"text":"5 stars because the waiter didn't hesitate to change my picky ass daughters order after the food was delivered. Keep in mind that they were about to close in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the kitchen staff here. Does anyone know the difference between over easy and over medium eggs? When the egg whites are runny, that's more like sunny side up, not even over easy. It was taken off the bill and they asked to correct it, but it already grossed me out trying to eat it."}
{"text":"I dont normally like pancakes.... but I love Babystacks. Bless them for adding a Henderson location! They have a very diverse menu. Just know their bacon is turkey bacon. They even have cookie butter french toast! Treat yo self  by coming here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Service was good, granted we were the first people there at 7AM on a Wednesday. 
I was expecting fluffy pancakes and instead, they were really hard. Maybe I just waited too long to eat them. 

The portions are generous and the coffee is really good."}
{"text":"Not bad here. Service was good, Edgar was pretty on point with everything. The hash browns were terrible my mom said. I liked the strawberry pancakes though. Not sure I'd come back, nothing impressed me enough to really make it desirable to come back. I remember the location up north being really good, not sure this location compares. And if you guys are reading this....please clean and dust the lights above the bar area, they look nasty."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Had an omelette and it tasted like something I'd have in a buffet line. Their toast is amazing though as weird as it sounds. Good butter!! May come back to try speciality pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is still the best breakfast place in Vegas! I love that the new location is in centennial and it's HUGE!!!!!! Like wayyyy bigger than the first two locations. They're still working out the kinks as it is a larger store. They've got a new special, COOKIE BUTTER FRENCH TOAST!!!! It's the new craze that everyone's been drooling over! It tastes amazing and it's such a huge portion that I can't even finish it! The cookie butter is sandwiched between the toast, topped with their homemade whipped cream and pie crust crumbles!!' Are you drooling yet kuz I am. They got banana foster pancakes, I was hesitant to try them because I didn't want anything too sweet but wow it's amazing, it was the perfect amount of bananas, caramel and whipped cream! Service is wonderful as ever, very attentive servers. The hosts are friendly and welcoming! Thank you Babystacks for opening up in centennial! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really pretty good coffee and the choices of pancakes was silly. Great family brunch today.  The single nutella crepe was awesome."}
{"text":"This is definitely a highly recommended breakfast spot.  It had all the makings of a great place--great food, great service, comfortable seating, etc.  Both locations are a bit of hump off the strip, but are great places to hit up after a weekend of binge drinking and other unsavory activities up to and including: donkey shows, midget lap dances, dice games at the MGM west wing alley way entrance, passing out nudie flyers.  I had the adobo omelette and shared a short stack of the red velvet pancakes with the lady.  Besides creativity, the omelette was pretty spot on.  No surprises here with the chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette.  Just good eats.  I could make a recommendation of trying to use pork instead of chicken next time.

The omelette also came with what could possibly be the best macaroni salad I've had in my life.  Rich and creamy with a possible hint of garlic or something magical, it left me wanting more and licking the tiny bowl the serving came in.

For the piece de resistance--red velvet pancakes.  Seems like a great idea in theory and even better in practice at babystacks.  The pancakes had a perfect melding of  cake and pancake texture while maintaining that subtle red velvet taste.  The cream on top was absolutely phenomenal and I would definitely consider that as a bath water substitute.  

All in all, great place with great food and service. Like I said, it is now a Vegas tradition of mine and you might want to consider making it one of your as well.  Unless, your leaving Vegas tradition is something like midget lap dances.  That sounds way better..."}
{"text":"this is seriously my favorite breakfast and brunch spot. i honestly wish they were open longer hours, of heck even 24 hours.

their baby chick skillet is my favorite. 2eggs, spinach, garlic, and mushrooms on top of potatoes, everything is really flavorful and i never leave with any food left on the plate.

their khaluah benedict is delicious. 

adobo fried rice omelet is delicious.

french toast is delicious. 

and their pancakes are to die for! ever flavor ive had was so good. my favorite of course are the red velets. banana cream pie runs in 2nd place.

the only problem i have here is the water taste a little funky and both locations are so small, some weekend you may be looking to wait an hour for a table. well worth it though!"}
{"text":"I went to Baby Stacks Cafe with my girls for a girls day! I really enjoyed the food I had the chili cheeseburger and the banana creme pancakes! It was so good! Everything was hot and fresh and the strawberry lemonade was so refreshing. I would truly come here over and over. I did not like how they do not split the checks. My girls and I had to calculate and split the totals up ourselves which was quite a pain. Other than that it would have gotten a 5, instead I gave it a 4. Definitely check it out for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"ONE OF THE MOST OVER RATED RESTAURANTS EVER!
Gosh, Im not one to wait an hour, Party of 7, food was a not that great, should have when to I hop, gravy was poor with no taste. the rice omelet that I got excited about horrible and only one of our party had any thing good to say. Hostess was rude , but waiter was trying but after we had our order messed up....
Yelp was wrong, after reading similarity stories about flavor profile and wait, its just not going to happen again, good waiting for a meal thats not that good!"}
{"text":"If you want pancakes and you go anywhere else besides here, you're crazy! So amazing, and the variety of different ones will make you drool!"}
{"text":"Everything is always so amazing here and the staff is friendly. Have yet to order anything questionable"}
{"text":"2nd time here.
I love it!  Food is fresh and amazing.
Service is fast and always greeted with a smile.
IM IN LOVE with hazelnut pancakes."}
{"text":"Weeee pancakes nom nom.

Soo this place is a interesting breakfast place. I believe its a asian/filipino/hawaiian style of food, but they also serve a wide assortment of pancakes. Came in with a couple of friends and the place was pretty busy. I didn't know that this location existed, but we were quickly seated. They have alot of the traditional breakfast fare, but they also have a bunch of hawaiian/asian food options as well.

We checked out of course what everyone gets: the red velvet pancakes! and the white chocolate macadamia pancakes! These things are more of a dessert rather than a actual dish, pure sugary sweetness. I liked the white chocolate ones but my friends thought they were waaay to sweet. But I think they jus have poor taste. the Red Velvet ones were exactly that, red dyed pancakes, with a interesting cream cheese syrup which sounded out but worked out well. I liked the red velvet, they were good, but I don't think they live up to the immense hype that I heard of.

We also ordered another dish, I think Huevos Rancheros or something, but it was obviously forgettable. To be honest, the place is my opinion is good, but it's not as amazing as everyone else makes to seem. The red velvet pancakes are good, and I liked the food, but there are much better breakfast places in town. I would return and I am not opposed to eating here, but its not something I am gonna get excited over either."}
{"text":"Very, very good food. And very good service as well. We arrived at 10am on a weekday morning, 1/2 hour wait. No problem, but the food better be good.....
It was! The pancakes were fluffy and rich. Chicken fried steak was good, but not memorable. Biscuits and gravy were also good with a nice consistency to the gravy.
My first exposure to Southern cuisine was Cajun influenced, so nothing quite comes close to the flavor/spice explosion of Cajun. But overall a very good breakfast and we look forward to coming back and exploring the menu some more. Love the Reggae in the morning."}
{"text":"We are regulars at the Henderson location and Love it..... Decided to try this location..... It's a lot roomier than Henderson and Love the Island vibe in here..... Had the Kalbi and Eggs.... It was Absolutely Delish.... not too fatty very flavorful..."}
{"text":"Decided to pop in here after hearing so many great things about it and I'm so glad I did! I ordered the bacon and eggs with potatoes and upgraded my pancakes to the famous red velvet. The eggs were cooked perfectly, I ordered them over medium and the yolks were perfectly runny and whites were fully cooked.  The potatoes were seasoned really well and the bacon was super thick cut. Way better than dennys or ihop offers. The pancakes are fluffy and the cream cheese syrup is delicious, not overly sweet. The melted whip cream on top adds a nice freshness. It only took about 5 minutes for my food to come out. My waitress made sure my coffee cup was full at all times. Just a few tips: make sure to check out the specials board, if I had I would have ordered the chocolate bliss pancakes instead of red velvet  (since one is limited and the other is permanent). Another one, they have this posted everywhere, you cannot split guest checks so if you come with a big party just be prepared! I will definitely be coming back! (One more thing, the portions here are huge so make sure you bring an appetite!)"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Great pancakes, omeletes and potatoes. A must whenever we are in town. Expect a wait but well worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious pancakes and omelettes selected from a vast menu.  I was also delighted to learn that they offer loco moco, although I didn't order it this time around."}
{"text":"Good. Favorite is the Oreo pancakes. My friends favorite is the red velvet. The wait is long. The bacon is good. Love the potatoes"}
{"text":"Been coming here for at least half a year to this particular location & I love how we are recognized by certain staff members. Janet & Joey. They're both our favorites ! & were lucky to have them as our servers when they're there. Janet has always been so nice since we first had her as our server and has always remembered us since the first time. & joey is awesome ! He even remembers our orders Everytime !  Love coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Although smaller than the Buffalo and Flamingo location I go to, it still serves the same delicious food and same great service. 

The wait for seating didn't take too long at all on a Thursday morning. When we were sat, they took our drink orders promptly and then our server eventually came to see us. She came and saw us pretty frequently, which I appreciated, especially since members of my party had to look through the extensive menu. When we ordered, it didn't take too long for our food to come out, which was pretty amazing. The food tasted just like how I was expecting. I'm glad the food quality and taste is consistent among the different locations. Babystacks regardless of location, is an amazing place to eat!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times already and I must say that I have been absolutely satisfied each and everytime I have been here. 

The name is BabyStacks Cafe, so you can assume that they specialize in pancakes, and specialize they do! The front page of their menu has a list of different kinds of pancakes they serve. The red velvet is supposedly the most popular, and it is delicious, but my favorite is the cinnabun personally. I personally wouldn't recommend ordering plain pancakes here since they have so many different specialties, but if that's something you like, I don't think that'd be a bad decision either. 

I usually order a skillet or omelette with a side of pancakes. It cost more to order specialty pancakes with your omelette or skillet, but you get the best of both worlds that way. I treat the pancakes like a dessert/side dish kind of thing because most of the pancakes are sweet. You get the main dish with eggs, meat, and maybe potatoes and then you have the pancakes on the side that that is just the perfect combination!

On the weekends, it gets kind of busy, so expect a wait unless you go fairly early and the service can be slow at times, but you can't expect every place to be overstaffed with people waiting to serve you when you come in. They do the best job they can. I remember I came here with many of my family members and we didn't get one of our orders of pancakes and they have us a free short stack of a random specialty pancake. I'm glad they made it up to us for not bringing our order in time because that showed me how much they care about their customer service. 

I recommend going here if you want to catch some breakfast or lunch. I personally won't go to any other breakfast specialty place in Vegas while BabyStacks is open for business."}
{"text":"Wow the food is delicious we ate their 2day in a row, Trac the waitress was so nice food was made quickly, I had the kalua eggs Benedict on the 1st visit my husband had biscuits n gravy, the 2nd day I tried the Portuguese fried rice omelet, so delicious, husband had loco moco very clean place, the music was awesome too. I highly recommend this place 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Had the Piggy scramble. It was the best! Had it with wonderful Cinnabum pancakes.with it. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"well i would love to put a 5 star. but i just had very bad service. i have never had an issue before.i have always had amazing food, great service and NO issues.
i walked in to a very not busy restaurant, got greated by a smile. all was great. then it started off when i asked for my favorite waiters section and they told me \"he no longer here\". i said \"aww my buddy santos is gone?!\"  at THAT moment turned bad the buser guy was RUDE AS HELL. didnt even finish walking me to a table. i sat myself wondering if i was at the right place. asked for a menu. and few minutes later was asked if i was ready to order. had to explain i didnt even have a menu! 
my food came out cold, the waiter was never coming to me and then never refilled my drink. the moment i stood up to leave he came over, oh you need a new drink? i told him no but i need a new place to eat. 
walked out after throwing my cash on the table. 
this place is amazing on the flavors unless you piss them off? guess i said the wrong thing! 
good bye carrot cake pancakes i will be eating them somewhere else."}
{"text":"It was a great time. Waited only 15 mins to get a table on a Saturday morning, which wasn't bad at all.
Food was delicious as always, I recommend the cinnabun pancake. It was all my dreams came true on a pancake. It brought me peace of mind when I took that first bite. It was HONESTLY heaven on a pancake, but that's just me.

Our waiter was a nice guy and even tho he messed up my girlfriends order a little bit. He saw he made a mistake and took the food away and made it fresh immediately.

I recommend this to anyone with the love for the finer breakfast and brunch places, also low on the price of food. Thanks for having me!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. We had the red velvet and Cinnabon pancakes as well as the breakfast burrito and cowboy omelets....and had to try a side if the garlic rice...everything was great. They were very busy but the staff hustled!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time this morning. Did not catch our servers name but on our receipt says Vangie.. hopefully correct because this young lady was very good. The food is fairly priced in my opinion. I had the orange creamsicle short stack with a side of spam. Ended up eating the rest of my boyfriends Loco moko because he was so full from his delicious red velvet pancakes. We enjoyed our first experience here and will return."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11 and almost a 40 min wait. Food was just okay. They do have pretty cool flavors/types of pancakes you'll never find anywhere else but everything else was just ok.  Tried the Nutella pancakes and spinach benedicts. Seasoning was good but Wish their pancakes weren't as dry. Portions are definitely shareable. Service was also just okay."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in town ! Awesome pancakes so many to pick from, but again my favorite is the s'mores short stack and turkey bacon also great coffee. I'm such a regular there they see me coming they have my order memorized and there always friendly and big smiles. But don't plane on just walking in the door and sitting down there is always so busy . omg long waiting they are  always packed with people but definitely well worth the waiting.  Whenever I have company I always take them here."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and they won't sit you if you don't have a full party, which I can understand if you have a big party but we had a party of 3!! We were waiting for 1 person. So my wife and I sat at the bar we wanted a cup of coffee while we waited, I asked on of the bus girls if we could have coffee so she walked over to the hostess and told her and she shook her head no, we waited a few more minutes and no service we were ignored. I will never go back to this location.... They are very rude!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast as my last meal before going to the airport to Las Vegas.  It is the quintessential breakfast restaurant.  It is very basic, offering nothing spectacular, but eggs, pancakes, french toast, hash browns, etc.  I had a denver omelette with hash browns.  The portions were good, but there really is not much to mention with BabyStacks Cafe.  I have tried it and I think the reviews are overrated.  Nothing was bad about my omelette that I ordered, but also nothing stuck out to rave about.  You can go if you want, but i think there are better options to grab a quality, simple breakfast off the strip, such as the Egg & I."}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast off the strip!! The wait was about 30-40 min for a table of 3. We came around 9:30am and it was a full house. The food is simply very good. I loved their corned beef hash. I also tried some of their short stack pancakes since that is what they're famous for. Yummy food :)"}
{"text":"Love it when friends take me out to the coolest must eats in sin city.  This was definitely a must try for those out of towners.  And a helpful warning,  come early before the breakfast rush or be prepared to wait because shortly after we ordered,  lines were out the door.  You know the locals have their spot.

Chocolate chip short stack- very good. Fluffy and flavorful!

Regular buttermilk short stack- indeed yummy! Even tho I do like my edge a little crispy 

Portuguese sausage plate - really good! Especially if you are a rice eater in the morning (Chel's guilty!)

Eggs benedict - sad to report that it lacked life in general.  No wow factor.  Bland.   Albeit I did love the runny yolk.  

White chocolate macademia nut-were ok.  I probably wouldn't order it again.

Red velvet pancakes was my favorite! One of the best I've had.  Fluffy and flavorful.   Served with their cream cheese syrup which I asked for extra serving because it was unbelievably good!  Kept me wanting more and more!!! 5/5 stars alone!!!

Red velvet pancakes will make me come back here again next trip I'm out here.  It's also their best seller!

Service was friendly.   They were indeed short handed for a Sunday?  But I was all good since we came just in time before the breakfast rush and our order came in good timing.  So yey!

#thankful #always #foramazingpeopleinmylife"}
{"text":"My friends had been talking about this place for a while and I finally decided to check it out. It's become my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. The service was wonderful and the staff was extremely friendly.  Don't even get me started on the food! The pancakes were so delicious and there are so many flavors it was so hard to make up my mind. I felt like there wasn't enough time to truly decide what I wanted. I highly recommend it and I know I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the go to place if you want a hearty breakfast and some uniquely flavored pancakes!
They also have traditional Filipino/Hawaiian style breakfast if you're into that.

They are famous for their red velvet pancakes which I can agree are delicious. 

Their vibe feels very island style with reggae music playing over the speaker system. My only qualm is that it's a small, tight place but other than that they're great!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. It's now kind of on the \"eh\" side.

Giving it three stars because the pancakes were good (red velvet is my fav) and our server was awesome. Never ran out of water and my boyfriend never ran out of coffee.

I got the Portuguese sausage plate. It tasted like kielbasa. Not what I was looking for. I upgraded to the garlic fried rice and it clearly states that there are onions in the rice but DAAANG, These were fairly larger pieces of onion that were barely cooked. It didn't taste like garlic at all. Just sweated out onions mixed in some oily rice. My eggs came out okay though. After I picked out the onions and mixed everything together things kind of got better.

So let me talk about the dude with the ponytail when we walked in. I made eye contact and said hi to him. He did not say hi back. I said it loud enough for others to hear it. He did say hi to my boyfriend though. Boyfriend said hi back. Boyfriend noticed he didn't say hi back to me and kind of brushed it off. I hope he didn't hear me or something because that was kind of rude. It kind of put me in a bad mood for the rest of our experience here though so that kind of sucked.

If I go back I think I would get either the loco moco or the kaluha pork grilled cheese. They looked good. I don't care if it doesn't \"match\" with the super sweet pancakes. It's good for the soul and you can always treat those like dessert. 

Make sure you come early and you are patient. This place gets really busy and it's really tight and cramped. Don't get impatient. It's not their fault."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were super excited to try this place out (it's right in front of our house) and there aren't many food places in our area. The red velvet pancakes are delicious but I didn't enjoy the burnt bacon I received. Also after drinking his coffee my boyfriend realized his cup had lipstick all over it! So we asked the waitress for a new one, then after drinking from that cup he realized there was lipstick yet again on the new cup! Yuck! Super turned off don't think I'll be visiting them again anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Great pancakes the perfect size & flavor. I wish cafes would stay open for dinner."}
{"text":"Had to bring the family cause of all the great reviews. We're big breakfast people so when the kids had a day off we went for a visit. The place is clean and bright and was pretty quiet for a weekday morning. 
I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice. Disappointing. The rice has hard and had a few charred pieces of chicken lending it a strange burned off -flavor. The egg \"wrap\" was thin and oily. I can usually finish a whole plate but it was so unappetizing I only had a third. The adobo fried rice rules at Thelmas... check em out. My husband had the Loco Moco and it was alright. It was the standard Hamburger patty and brown sauce found in many valley local places, nothing special. The kids had the children's breakfast - eggs & pancakes. Also nothing special. Our big mistake was getting only a side of Red Velvet Pancakes to \"try em out\". They were heavenly! I almost like em better than Nothing Bundt Cakes Red Velvet Bundt. They came out hot soft and fluffy, with a light puff of whipped cream and choco shaving. There was a side of cream cheese topping which was heavenly drizzled on top. Just lovely. It was funny watching a grown man wrestle over pancakes with a determined and hungry five year old. Priceless. Save yourself some disappointment and go there for the Red Velvet Pancakes... you won't be sorry! 
Staff was very friendly and attentive.  The tables were very small though and crammed together so if you want some breathing room I recommend you come on a weekday cause the weekends are packed!"}
{"text":"We have came to this place four or five times. The food is great and the service is just as good. But to get seated is terrible. Out of the five times we have been here we have had to tell the hostess four times why are these people who came in after us being seated.  Mind you they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"I was told by a buddy, and fellow Yelper, Baby Stacks was the bomb and couldn't wait for the Centennial location to open so I could give it a whirl. We slipped in on a Sunday morning about 9:00am and were promptly greeted by smiling personnel, but were told it would be a few minutes. Although it was relatively busy, about half of the tables were empty. We were finally seated and were made to wait for beverage orders and then again made to wait before giving our breakfast order. The party seated after us and seated right next to us was taken care of first. I opted for the Chicken Fried Steak, which is listed as Country Fried Steak on the menu. It comes with eggs, like you would expect, but you can opt for garlic rice instead of potatoes. What? Garlic with breakfast? OMG! Awesome! The meat was cooked to perfection and the breading was fantastic. I would rank this among some of the best CFS in Vegas. I ordered the eggs over-easy and they were a little on the runny side, so keep that in mind when ordering your huevos. My meal came with a choice of bread, which included buttermilk pancakes, or an upgrade to any speciality pancake. I chose the bacon pancake. Bacon baked right in. Everything is better with bacon, right? The Mrs. opted for the red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. Wow! It was like dessert for breakfast. I am sure there are healthier choices on the menu, but if you are going to do it, you might as well do it up right. The food definitely lived up to the hype. The service, not so much. We'll just chaulk it up to working out the kinks during the first week. I will definitely be back and can't wait to see the looks on the faces of the Breakfast Club when they bite into the specialty pancake of their choosing."}
{"text":"Definitely prefer this location to the one off Buffalo-- way more seating.

I had the kalua pig benedict with browns. I give this four stars, only because the pulled pork could have been a bit more flavorful-- it helped when I dunked bites in ketchup. It also could have benefited with stronger texture-- the bites were a bit soggy toward the end."}
{"text":"i got the piglet omelette with red velvet pancakes, 

food was incredible. best breakfast restaurant in Henderson if you like pancakes! they have like 15-20 different types!"}
{"text":"Baby Stacks has one of the most unique arrays of pancakes....red velvet ..peanut butter and in pic ( i had to have these) Butterfinger pancakes and yummmmm to these... 20 minute wait and worth every moment sitting down also shown a Cowboy Skillet Chicken Fried Steak plate and French Toast Combo... clean quick and kudos to the kitchen good hot food.. this one is a do again"}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place and since we visited LV this past weekend we finally got a chance. My cousin lives in LV so that's how we found out about babystacks. Took us about 25 minutes to get seated during normal brunch time on a Friday morning. I ordered the spam scramble with garlic rice and got a side of their glorious red velvet pancakes. Both were aaaaaaamazing!!!! The red velvet pancakes were so moist and with the combo of the whip cream, chocolate chips, and cream cheese frosting, OMG!!!!! to die!! My fiance ordered the adobo fried rice omelette and that was phenomenal to!! Good service and great food!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes I ever had. 
The servers always busy always see if everyone satisfied with there stay :)
I love it here"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place to eat. Gives iHop a run for its money any day of the week. The babystack pancakes are to die for!  Everything on the menu looked and sounded delicious. After minutes of decision making I went with the country fried steak with the upgrade and the hazelnut pancakes. I left happy with a full belly. Would be coming back soon to try the rest of their pancakes. Please open up a chain in San Antonio!!"}
{"text":"Didn't quite live up to the hype. All pancakes on the menu sounded amazing but they weren't as soft and fluffy as I would've hoped. Prices weren't cheap either. 

S'mores and cinnamon roll pancakes were the most memorable, bacon sadly wasn't so hot."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Didn't have to wait for a table, everything was delicious, friendly staff, good music, pleasant ambience, and they had the World Cup game on tv. I had the two egg breakfast with strawberry pancakes. The whipped cream & syrup tasted incredible and fresh, pancakes were delicious, seasoned potatoes were delicious, waitress was attentive, I just wish I had ordered more pancakes :)"}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch here with my girls, restaurant was packed but we managed to get seats in 10-15 minutes which wasn't bad.  Waitress was quick to service us, my friends had red velvet pancakes and crepes.  I went for the Hazelnut pancakes which were amazing!  I like how there is a hawaiian selection on menu like loco moco and adobo!  Will definitely go back to try it again next time I have people in town visiting!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with friends visiting from out of town.  I always take people here for crepes/pancakes/coffee.   We loved the food and the service was great!  The pancakes were delicious, we tried the lemon ricotta and white chocolate chip macadamia nut which were amazing.  Also, Rick's adobo fried rice and the portuguese sausage was good too!"}
{"text":"I still love this place. They've added more Hawaiian items to their menu. I went with their Special, Portuguese sausage fried rice (sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions and so much flavor) with eggs. They also added some cool pancake varieties: Carrot cake pancakes, Lemon Ricotta and Mocha chip. Not enough time to try them all."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is that they don't have a long wait line! The food wasn't as good as the first location. My steak and eggs was horrible, the steak was so chewy that I couldn't even cut it. The biscuit was old and hard. My toasts came out when we almost finished our lunch. They only had a few tables but the service was super slow. Don't think I would come back to this location."}
{"text":"Just meh.  The hash browns were kind of gross.  Pancake selection was pretty good though.  Crappy cafeteria seating."}
{"text":"First time here.. Wonderful staff, great food, I have not one complaint about this place."}
{"text":"I usually like to visit an establishment more than once before writing about it. This was my first time here. I was very impressed with the brunch so I had to write about BabyStacks while it was still fresh in my mind.  I went to BabyStacks today with the Camilleon and her Uncle Kai. I'm already a fan. I know I will be coming here again. 

I needed to carb up for a cootie-tag session at town square and BabyStacks somehow crossed my mind. OTW! It was 1 o'clock and the place was packed. A very good sign. The hostess said it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait. We were seated in 10. 

I order the steak and eggs over easy with hash browns, and opted for the upgraded two stack red velvet pancakes. Uncle Kai gets  some kind of avocado sandmich and fries with a stack of banana cream pancakes. The steak and eggs meets the standard specifications of steak and eggs. Nothing was left on the plate. I did not sample the avocado sandmich so I can't comment on it. Let's get to the pancakes. I did sample the homie's banana cream pancakes. I had one bite. It was    AIGHT. Now to their Red Velvet Pancakes. \"OH SHIT! LOOK AT THE MOTHAPHO'KIN WHEELS!!!\" I finally get to try these things. It came with cream cheese syrup and topped with whipped cream. Hmmm? Where's the syrup? I can't eat this without... I go ahead and take a bite. DAMN SUN!?! I tell Camille's uncle to try the pancakes. Both of us were instant fans. Needless to say, all of my plates were cleaned off. 

My brunch started off good with a solid steak and eggs and ended off great with DEM RED VELVET PANCAKES SUN!!!

BabyStacks...EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever we fly to Las Vegas, our family always has somewhere new to take us. This was one of the new places they wanted us to try and after eating here, I went back to Hawaii and told all of my friends and family where to go to eat! 

The staff here is friendly and attentive. If we weren't too sure on what to eat the waiter ( I forgot his name ?) was very helpful in recommending what to eat! They also kept coming around and asking if we needed more drinks and if our food was alright. The service was amazing! 

Next, the food! I loved every last bit of it! We ordered what we wanted to eat and we all shared our food so we could sample a little bit of everything. I'm very happy to see that they have some local Hawaii favorites like spam and Portuguese sausage! 

Overall it was an awesome dining experience! I'm glad I have someplace I can go if I miss the food from home!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! 
They are always busy. I usually order take out since I work next door to it. Whether I walk in to place my take out order or call it in they are always nice no matter how busy they are. They always get my order accurate with the modifications I make. It's always delicious. No complaints, I will happily return :)"}
{"text":"This place is really good. No pretense no fancy flowers at your table just the good stuff. Fair and reasonable prices super friendly wait staff. Yummy pancakes , good omelets, and unique dishes.. But duh get the pancakes they are amazing, moist and absorbs the delish topping. German chocolate taste just like the cake. Don't pretend your dieting you just end up regreting that life choice ."}
{"text":"What do you do when you have a day off from work and decide to go hiking at Mt. Charleston but then find yourself driving in pouring rain?  Go get some yummy breakfast at Baby Stacks in Summerlin!

So many good things about this place.  Here is what I got to try so far:
- Red Velvet pancakes with buttercream frosting topping.  Small little pancakes just the perfect size for a sweet taste.
- Portugese sausage with eggs and rice.  This place gives you more than 4 slices of sausage!  I hate when I have to ration out my Portugese sausage to last the entire meal.  There were 9 slices I believe!  Enough to get your fix.  Upgrade your rice for garlic rice.  You won't be disappointed.
- Kalua pork and eggs benedict.  Usually kalua pork is too salty but this one is not too salty at all.  My roommate thought it was bland but I would rather it be less salty than too salty.  An interesting take on the usual eggs benedict.

I really want to take my parents here when they come to visit.  It is a cute little brunch place that anyone will enjoy."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!! We were on our way to Hoover dam and found this gem! Pancakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"What a terrific place!!!! We stopped in today while in Vegas overnight. I hate the chains, so I always appreciate a family run cafe with great food and service. I had the Huntington omelet with seasoned potatoes Came with a side of pancakes and they were delicious. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly. Best breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"You're likely to have a slight wait if it's the weekend during breakfast or lunch - but WORTH THE WAIT. Friendly staff, great service, super clean and food comes quickly. Nice sized portions and food is Delicious. A neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Perfect place to start your morning! Wait staff is very nice. They got us seated right away, and the order came out quick and was delicious!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this 4 stars is because there isn't a location close to mine.  :(  I love a good breakfast place that has unique/original breakfast dishes such as their adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelet.  Not only was it unique...it was really good!  All their pancakes are fantastic...well the ones I've tried (such as their red velvet pancakes)  Their service was great and fast.  The new location has more space.  Clean, great, service, and great breakfast food!"}
{"text":"This new location in the northwest is probably the most spacious one of the other locations.  I like how Babystacks has a variety of not just your average eggs and bacon breakfast dishes.  They have filipino and hawaiian style dishes as well.  Their pancakes are fantastic!  I've had the regular, red velvet, and banana pancakes.  All were perfect and just the right size!  I've also had the Portuguese sausage with eggs and rice.  I like how they cut the sausages small and semi crispy (just how I like it) and it's not greasy.  I've also had the adobo fried rice omelet.  That dish can probably fit two people because it's so huge!  The only thing I didn't like was the garlic fried rice.  I wasn't a fan of the onions.  Other than that, this is an above average breakfast/lunch cafe!"}
{"text":"This breakfast cafe is something I'll definitely come back and visit every trip to Vegas! You have to try to orange sherbet pancakes.... absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life. I had the senior breakfast. Scrambled eggs tasted like they came out of a box, the sausage tasted raw and barely resembled meat and the only thing that saved the seasoned potatoes was the ketchup. Everything was very Bland including the tiny bit of salsa they gave me for $0.75 extra. The place was packed there was about 20 minute wait at 10 o'clock in the morning. Better breakfast places would include Denny's, IHOP, or the Santa Fe Station."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food and customer service here. I love their adobo fried rice and banana cream pie pancakes. Servers keep your coffee cup filled at all times--I love it."}
{"text":"the adobo omelette lacked flavor and pieces of the chicken werent mixed in well.  the kalua pork benedict was dry and eggs were overcooked. the banana creme pancake was delicious but was not fluffy and didnt have enough bananas"}
{"text":"Pancakes are delicious...but if you haven't tried their skillets you should!!! SO GOOD! Definitely go if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This is our most favorite breakfast spot in town. It is always a 20 to 30 minute wait (No Reservations allowed) and worth it! I would recommend you go there not in a rush and wear stretchy pants... Because you will not leave there hungry!

This is an amazing pancake House with a Hawaiian twist. Every time I go there I think I know what I want to order...then I see somebody else's food and change my mind. Everytime I branch out of my comfort zone and get something new I'm never disappointed.

The seating is small and somewhat cramped but the staff does a tremendous job of making sure all the tables are bussed and filled very fast. Our waitress is always such a sweetheart and gives us our drinks to go at the end. It is such a nice touch to have such great customer service!

Now for the food! Where do I begin? My husband's favorite is the adobo rice omelette... But he loves their skillets too. I have too many favorites to choose from including the Portuguese sausage, spam & garlic sticky rice, all their Eggs Benedicts, Mac salad, and of course their Loco Moco! 

The interior is painted cheerfully bright with different colors and upbeat Hawaiian and reggae music keep the customers happy. I would definitely say the vibe here is completely Island-friendly and super chill.

As for the pancakes... My 6 year old is a complete pancake foodie and claims their red velvet are the best in town. She always picks this place for breakfast and I can see why because they treat her like a princess and give her the hook up with the extra whipped cream. My husband loves the German chocolate pancakes but claims he will have a heart attack if he eats them more than once a year. All the pancakes are incredibly decadent and today, when we went I watched a woman steal her husband's Banana Foster pancakes and ate half of them before he even noticed lol.

I highly recommend you come here and take your time it's worth the wait. Give the menu items you've never tried a chance because your mind will be blown!"}
{"text":"For a breakfast place I think it's a little pricey, however I feel like their ingredients are very fresh. The food was okay though, I think it was lacking a little flavor, and the pancakes left a weird after taste, maybe it's the flour. The place is very small so if you are going on a weekend there's going to be a long wait."}
{"text":"I really do love going to Babystacks Cafe. It is a nice place to indulge on a weekend when you won't feel as bad for eating a stack of sugar stacked on sugar. Seriously, all 20 or so options of pancake combinations are amazing. What is also amazing at this cafe and that I really suggest every tries, is their Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, sooo good and flavorful. 
The only thing that could be different that would probably be popular with a lot of their patrons is that they do not split checks here! I understand the reasoning, it just can be slightly inconvenient with groups of people."}
{"text":"Many thanks to Maryann M. and Elaine M. for telling us about this place!

The red velvet short stack of 3 pancakes with side of dipping sauce and dusted chocolate over whipped cream was out-of-this-world delicious! Each bite was fluffy, savory, and so light like a cloud that it did not feel like we are eating cupcakes! AHHHH!!!! *DROOL* I am so glad they are not close to my house because I'd easily be there everyday.

We also ordered coffee, orange juice, and chose to share the BYO skillet with Portuguese sausage, mushroom, spinach, pepper jack cheese, and scrambled eggs. The eggs were super fluffy with a delicious garlic flavor. The plate also came with side of sourdough toast all buttered up.

MMmmmmmm... We will definitely be back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVE pancake place.  Well not just me but my whole family.  We have to come here for breakfast everytime we visit LV.  I love that they have tons of pancakes to choose from.  My choice is always the red velvet, it's like having dessert for breakfast, need I say more?  I don't have to use the cream cheese syrup as it is good by itself.  My mom and I always share a spam scramble plate (scrambled eggs, spam, rice, and furikake) which appeals to my Filipino side and the red velvet pancake.  My husband always try different types of banana pancakes, he got the banana cream pie this past 4th of July.  Our children loves the s'mores one.  Our youngest who has a hard time finishing his food actually ate spam scramble and his own stack of pancake and finished it all!  They also had adobo chicken fried rice which is very good but can be too much if you have to finish it yourself, so share!  We can't wait to visit our parents again and have delicious breakfast at Baby Stacks!

Btw, the wait is super long...but definitely worth it.  Service is good and fast."}
{"text":"Hmmm I have weird reviews on Babycakes.So I gave them a 3 star cause the pepper killed my food. So I will just don't know were to start. Ok let's just start with the food. 

RV pancakes it's alright nothing to rave about. The only thing that is good was the sauce for it and it was moist. White Mac pancakes nothing different just add mac nuts in a regular pancakes and top it off with white chocolate chips. oooooh so exciting. I ordered the the Rick's adobo fried rice and my niece ordered the loco moco. Man can I say \"someone REALLY loves pepper. Even the mac salad was way to peppery. It seem like someone was mad at the pepper that day. The Loco moco was ehhh good. My nephew ordered the piglet which was actually good. But I can't say about the home fries I did not taste it cause I'm not a fan of any type of home fries except for hash browns. 

The service was friendly and I think she was the manager she was awesome. She came a few times to check on us. And so did the waitress. That's always a plus. Water was filled and with a smile. 

The place is cute and the decor was pretty cool. They even have a section for the kids coloring section. plus plus for that. 

The parking is a private lot which there is plenty. I would love to come back but it's far from where I live so it might be awhile. 

But be prepared to wait for awhile there was a wait of 15 mins when we got there at 1230 (lunch time)"}
{"text":"Decent food. The selection of pancakes was impressive- I enjoyed the gingerbread pancakes for the holidays! Unfortunately our server forgot to put in our order so we had a while at the table before he realized it, but tried to compensate with a discount on our bill."}
{"text":"Good thing I love the food here!! But same host from the last time I was here sat people before us and forgot about us. How do I know even the cashier corrected the host telling her that she sat people before us. Hopefully this won't happen!! Happy Holidays!!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet pancakes with cream cheese mmmm. The full stack can feed 2 people. Everything in the menu looks so good. I would gladly wake up early after partying to get more food.. That's saying a lot"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes & garlic fried rice. The end!"}
{"text":"Definitely a MUST TRY breakfast spot when visiting Vegas!   I have been hearing about the red velvet pancakes and finally went to try them out myself.  Friday morning we had a table of about 10 and waited almost an hour for a table, but it was so worth it!!  If you come with a big group, best go as early as possible!

Out of the dishes we ordered, I tasted: red velvet pancakes, adobo fried rice omelet, and the loco moco.  The pancakes were so much better than I expected them to be!  I'm really not a fan of pancakes but the red velvet ones were super delicious!  And they're not topped with butter; they're topped with a cream cheese syrup and chocolate chips.  Loco moco was really good and I absolutely loved the adobo fried rice.  Prolly gained 5lbs while eating there but I will def want to come back the next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Good food at good prices, this is like a mom and pop dinner. They have over 22 kinds of pancakes, awesome skillets and omelettes. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Babystacks that's on Stephanie or the one around Flamingo. I had a good experience with both places. However, at this location it was not great as the other Babystacks. The service was alright. The seating and serving was quick. The problem was the cook. I believe whoever is in the kitchen isn't as great as the other locations. My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict and I got the Loco Moco. Both eggs were overcooked. I regret recommending this place to my boyfriend and he didn't even get to enjoy his meal. Aside from that, my meal was a bit off too. The meat was too overcooked and there was hardly any rice. It was a very disappointing breakfast. I even had the special Babystacks Pancakes to go and that order was wrong. I asked for cream cheese instead of syrup. Never bothered asking for a replacement because my bf and I just wanted to leave the place. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Breakfast Skillets! This place has changed my life and now I am constantly looking for breakfast skillets everywhere. Why aren't they more common? Maybe it's a West Coast thing. Pancakes were a bit too sweet, so I knocked off a star. Will 100% be back when I am in the area"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, pretty good prices, friendly staff willing to please. Been here a couple times, great experiences. Can get pretty packed on weekend morning, still haven't had to wait to be seated. Huge pancake selection, along with an aray of other great American breakfast choices. Good location, enough parking, clean restaurant, great for groups and kids."}
{"text":"I don't understand why others have a problem with this place.   Excellent food, reasonable prices and extremely good service.  Everything we order there is delicious.  They get very busy so the best advice I can give is to get there super early."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the servers were fast and friendly.  My favorite pancake location."}
{"text":"Great pancakes, if you go for that you will not be disappointed.  The bacon and ham were good too but the hash browns were absolutely terrible, I could finish them which is ridiculous for me.  I give the pancakes 5 stars the rest 3.5 and the hashbrown 0.  Go here and eat those pancakes.  Pumpkin and Red Velvet pancakes were amazing"}
{"text":"Ono local grindz we did a sister trip to Las Vegas to celebrate one of my sisters 50th birthday. Today, we wanted an authentic local style meal & this did not disappoint! The Portuguese sausage is the real one, not the lunch meat! We ordered adobo omelette, Portuguese sausage & eggs, loco moco, red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta, hazel nut pancakes & honey French toast... all was yummy!! If you're ever in the area & looking for a great island style homemade meal, this is the place to go to!! Ask for Edgar, he was our server, he was the best!!"}
{"text":"Decent specialty pancakes and decent service the three times I went. I will continue to go and get something different every time, and I don't see why you wouldn't want to come here. Not too too pricey in my opinion, never had a problem with my order, and the people there are always willing to satisfy your needs. Love it!"}
{"text":"The one star is for exceptionally poor service. Went for breakfast decided to have pancakes that came with omelet to go to enjoy later. When I received the pancakes they were noticeably smaller than normal and compared to the pancakes I ordered to go for my grandmother. I brought it to the waitress attention who was also a manager, and instead of apologizing she argued that's how they came. I pointed to other customers plates that there was a major difference yet still no apology and refused to give me a new order as I requested. I called when I got home, spoke to another manager who instead of an apology argued. Finally was offered a replacement. I asked if my brother could pick them up on his way home but was told I would have to drive all the way back and bring the small pancakes for a replacement. Considering it's 108 degrees not worth the time or energy to bring my 98 year old grandmother out for something that should have been addressed at the restaurant."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about Baby Stacks from local friends around the area. When I visited their website, the pics looked to good to be true. Here are my thoughts on Baby Stacks:

The Good:
Holy moly, their breakfast was so good!! They specialize in pancakes, of course. They have a wide variety of just about everything you can think of to mix in to pancake batter. In fact, there were a few specials of pancakes that weren't even on the menu. 

I had an egg white omelet with a side of rice instead of hash browns. In addition, I ordered a mini side of chocolate chip pancakes. SO GOOD!

The Bad:
It's hard to eat healthy in this type of breakfast place. Most all of the pancakes and breakfast items are for sure going to be high in calories. But, sometimes you have to treat yourself every once in a while. 

Oh, also their tables are a bit small for their plate sizes. Other than that, Baby Stacks was great!"}
{"text":"This is a great option for Sunday brunch! I love that's just on the corner. 
Cons: 
- don't split the bills
- American Express is not accepted"}
{"text":"Today was my first time there... and I really loved the service and the food! A friend who goes often, took me there and I ordered the favorite rice and red velvet pancakes. I really loved it! But, what brought me here to write the review it was the service. The guy was really the best waiter ever.
You can follow me at Instagram: @docsabrina"}
{"text":"This is located on Buffalo and Flamingo, slightly south of Flamingo in a plaza on the west side of the street. They only seat a complete party so if you're waiting on friends, tell them to hurry their butts over!

I've only gone once, but LOVED it. I'm not usually a pancake fan, but their Strawberry short stack was delicious. I also got to try a bite of the Banana Cream pie which was also delicious, and a bite of Honey Toast. Yeah I took a bite out of everyone's plate around me. :D 

The service was great, my water was never empty, and I tend to drink a LOT of water at places. Loved every bit of food I had tasted and cannot wait to try more!

Oh the short stack really filled me up, I was extremely hungry, but for some reason I felt it was better to go on the lighter side, and I still felt full, albeit  I had a few extra bites of other things as well."}
{"text":"We kept hearing about Babycakes from our friends that live out around Summerlin or Lower Utah area LOL and because of the distance we put them off. But, we were around the area running errands and found some time to see what everyone was hooting and hollering about. I'm glad we did.

We walked in around 11:30 and it was semi crowded. We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important). My daughter also noticed the decor, especially the 2 huge butterflies on each side of the beautiful flat screen that was on ESPN. I really liked that decor...not the butterflies but the ESPN. They also put up the kids Babycakes menu colorings all around the restaurants. You can also see the cooking area, it is small but they churn out ONO grindz!

This was our 1st time but we've heard enough through our friends and  Yelpizzles on what we should try. My wife ordered the Cowboy omelette which was pretty big and ordered their new Rock Road Pancakes. I ordered the Kalua Pig benedict.

~RR pancakes. Our kids loved it and what kid wouldn't. The chocolate pancakes were fluffy and loaded with mini marshmallows, choco syrup, slivered almonds, and topped with whipped cream. They also have other pancakes which you can get in full or short stacks. ( we'll try these next time)
-Red Velvet
-S'Mores
-PB & Jelly
-Lemon Ricotta
-Carrot Cake
-Bacon Pancakes
-Whole Wheat

~Cowboy omelette-  For $9.95 she got good size 4 egg omelette with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. And you can get either toast or get 3 buttermilk pancakes. You can also upgrade the pancakes to any of the above.

~Kalua Pig Benedict was really good. I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself \"Why cabbage?\" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.

I saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it. This will be my next choice.

Babycakes is worth the drive and the wait. We've been here once and it won't be our last. But, we do have a message to Babycakes owners....Babycakes please make your way to GVR area...PLEASE!! 

A Hui Ho"}
{"text":"Came here again yesterday for a late breakfast with my boys. This time I ordered the loco moco with a side of the Hazelnut short stack. My man ordered the kalua grilled cheese which was way too salty for him; so much that he let the waitress know and had to order something else. Saltiness was also an issue the last time I came here and ordered the adobo fried rice. By reading other peoples' reviews, it seems to be a problem. 
My hamburger patty was a bit too overcooked, so it was almost like chewing on rubber, however, the garlic fried rice was really good. The Hazelnut pancakes were ok, nothing special and actually a bit too dry with a funky after taste. I'm going to keep giving this location more chances since it's so convenient to our house and one of the only decent breakfast spots. Easy on the soy sauce, folks!"}
{"text":"I love Babystacks' food...their adobo fried rice is not very consistent, however. Sometimes it's a little too salty. Today, there wasn't much rice (mostly adobo) and it was very salty. The homemade corn beef hash is always good and you can never go wrong with their pancakes and potatoes. I can't wait until the Blue Diamond location opens up, which is scheduled for Monday, June 6th :)"}
{"text":"Best Pancakes in town. Expect a 15-30 min wait time, worth every minute. The other options besides pancakes are just as good."}
{"text":"Terrible service sat there for 10 mins watched 3 other groups get sat and ordered and no one still yet to even ask what we want to drink good place to eat just not this one!!"}
{"text":"Had the Carrot Cake short stack and a strawberry lemonade. Both were pretty good. Service was ok as well. Wasn't overly busy. I arrive around 8 in the morning. I'd return whenever I return to Vegas"}
{"text":"This was the most incredible breakfast that I've had in Las Vegas. I'm originally from Chicago and breakfast places like this are dime a dozen. They served the most fantastic breakfast and have the greatest amount of choices. The plates are very well proportioned everything was cooked to perfection. the flavors match very well with the food on the menu. The prices were normal the service was absolutely excellent and friendly and the cooks obviously know what they're doing. The pancakes are absolutely unbelievable. I had the banana cream pie pancakes they are phenomenal. It was the best pancake I ever eaten! I will be back many more times especially with folks from out of town or looking for that type of food and not the typical Hotel buffet food. They have a plethora of choices and everything we ordered was prepared very well and quickly. Try it let me know what you think."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious breakfast place in Las Vegas. Everything from their biscuits and gravy to their pancakes is absolutely superb. Anytime I've gone I haven't had to wait more than ten minutes, even during the busiest times. The staff is very attentive and friendly. Can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I love this place! We will definitely be back again to try all the different pancakes. 
We ordered Lolo Ricks Adobo Fried Rice and a short stack of hazelnut pancakes. The fried rice was absolutely delicious and served wrapped in an omelette. The pancakes were absolutely scrumptious. 

Our waitress Kayla was the sweetest and very helpful after she learned it was our first time there. 

More than 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"BABYSTACK on Blue Diamond! Its the best I tell ya! 

I have been to the other two locations, but the BD location has them beat!. It's a newer facility so it feels cleaner, it seems larger and the service is AWESOME!

Our server, wish I could remember his name, seems to be the Babystack Ambassador. His recommendations were on point. My husband ordered the chili moco. However, the Ambassador had advised my husband to get it with the side of Portuguese sausage so that my husband could have it with both the sausage and the hamburger patty. My husband was floored to see that the Portuguese sausage sliced and surrounding his plate, but also had sausages between the rice and hamburger patty! What!? And the chili was really good.

My husband did order a side of the bacon pancake which he wasn't too impressed with.

I ordered the ever famous Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and got a side of the lemon ricotta based on the Ambassador's recommendation. He said it would be lighter since it was a crepe and since our breakfast was more on the heavy side. DAAYUM that lemon ricotta was super ono!

To Lolo Rick or Lola Cora, could you consider adding shrimp sarciado to your menu, please? It is my favorite back home in HI and I haven't been able to find a Filipino restaurant in Vegas that makes it. That dish is a hit in HI and I'm sure it will be a hit in Vegas as well."}
{"text":"Breakfast is so good! They serve up local food and everyone in our party of 8 was definitely satisfied. Great service, too. We will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and will not be back. First of all the seating was uncomfortable,  the booths are hard wood. The orange juice was from frozen concentrate. Ordered a ham and cheddar omelet, seasoned potatoes and asked to have onions and bell peppers added to the potatoes. On the side I ordered the banana cream pie pancakes. The first omelet was burned and included onions and bell peppers. I  tried the pancakes while waiting for the re-order, they were bland and tasted like flour, there were two pieces of banana cooked into the pancakes. The second omelet arrives, again burned eggs, not very flavorful,  and I was unchanged to add cheddar on the inside. Needless to say, despite starving, I could not finish the meal. When on my last bite, after my boyfriend was done with his meal, the waitresses finally returned to the table to ask \"was everything ok\", not giving us a chance to answer, she disappeared into the kitchen. When we went up to the counter to pay, we were asked by the lady how everything was, when I gave my opinion and pointed to the almost whole breakfast that I had left on the table, she made no offer to adjust the bill. Then our waitresses walked up to the counter and started arguing with us that had we said something at the table, she would have adjusted the bill, then repeated herself in saying it, I walked out and left my boyfriend to deal with her. The whole experience was a gross fiasco."}
{"text":"WoW.
Nice breakfast atmoshere. Good service.
The variety of breakfast offerings is amazing. Babystacks definitely has
something on the menu you'll love. The pancake selection is absolutely
mind boggling ----S'mores pancakes? Check. Red velvet? Check. Old
fashioned regular buttermilk? Check. And pretty much every other tasty
permutation of pancake you can think of.
I wasn't in the mood for sweet. I came for savory. I ordered the Loco Moco
which is made up of a burger patty on top of steamed rice. Egg on top of 
that,  topped with a tasty rich brown gravy. Macaroni salad side. Marvelous.
The prices are fair. This is a 4 star eating extravaganza.
If you show up late for breakfast, don't bitch about having to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"I've rode past this little gem a few times but never eaten there until yesterday. The wait time of 30min was expected because of the limited space, but I'd wait an hour for the food and service. I ordered the ribs and eggs with garlic rice and it was soo good. So good I almost bit my husbands hand off when he tried to \"taste\" my food. Our 4yr old is usually a picky eater but he devoured his mini babycake meal. We will definitely become regulars here"}
{"text":"Our server Amanda was super friendly and helpful! In addition to great service, the food was on point! Portuguese sausage, eggs, rice, and a side of red velvet pancakes are my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Slow service, but the food is ok. Nothing to write home about though.  The seasoned potatoes are better than other breakfast places in town."}
{"text":"How badly did we want to eat here?  So bad...that we walked in the blistering heat to catch a bus, walk some more...just to get here!  

I only had one thing on my mind...lemon ricotta pancakes with cream cheese syrup.  Add that to spam, eggs, and garlic rice...and I've got my perfect breakfast. The pancakes were everything I thought they would be.  They were crepe style...great consistency...squeeze a lemon on top...and then bam!  Cream cheese syrup for the win!  Service was fantastic...

Only thing is...would I go through all that to come back here again?  Prob not...unless we rented a car.  But I thought the breakfast was worth every dollar...great stuff!"}
{"text":"i love this place . it's irie and chill BUT THE OWNER NEEDS TO CATHCH UP TO THE TIME AND PROVIDE FLAVORED CREAMER PLEASE!!! Now a days if a place doesn't have flavored creamer it's a sign of being behinds times and also just being cheap to no spend extra money. again I LOVE THIS PLACE BUTT management pls make coffee more enjoyable . ppl by drink at starbucks don't like plain boring coffee with half and half"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and the red velvet pancakes are to die for. Love how the staff is friendly and quick with everything and always pay attention to detail. I'm a customer for life"}
{"text":"Pancakes are very tasty, but it's no life-changing experience. I had the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage and I upgraded my pancakes to Red Velvet. I was with a large group of friends so I got to sample several of the other specialty pancakes. Again, they were all very good, but they don't really live up to the hype... but then again, how could they?  The burrito was also good but nothing special.

I will say that the serving sizes were much smaller than they appear in all the pictures. Not that important to me, but just thought that that was interesting.

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"First of all, the only reason this place is getting a 4 star rather than a 5, is because if it's a weekend day, the wait is always at least an hour. Maybe it's time to expand? Or have a to-go menu?

I was sent over to Babystacks via a friend in the area. I had the red velvet pancakes with my eggs and hashbrowns. They were to die for.  Like dessert and heaven made a baby.

I can't remember what my mom and husband ate, but we all left very happy.

I'll be back, but on a Monday morning. Figure out how to improve traffic so locals can eat here on the weekend, too!"}
{"text":"Cookie butter French toast is a must. The Huntington skillet is also a favorite.  I feel that this location is better than the other one, as this one is larger, and the cookie butter French toast is plated better."}
{"text":"very good, specialty are pancakes. i had the blueberry shorts and they were great. huevos rancheros OK. Pancakes,coffee and ambiance is good. WIll be back!"}
{"text":"This o s a great place for breakfast I love their French toast here. The service is good, it does get a bit crowded at times bilut it is still worth it you get a great breakfast at a decent price."}
{"text":"We're from out-of-town, and searching Yelp can be overwhelming in a city like Las Vegas with lots of choices. This was tasty, affordable and friendly. I'd say no if you have more than 6 in your party as it's not cramped, but not huge either. 

I got the cinnabun shortstack pancakes (3 cakes) and a side of the Portuguese sausage. The pancakes had crushed pecans, a dusting of sugar and cinnamon and a drizzle of icing. They were so good I only needed syrup for the bottom pancake that missed out on some topping. That's saying a lot, as I love my syrup! The sausage is a link cut on the bias, and has a great smoky flavor. Think of it as a kielbasa with more savory touches. I also got to eat some of the bacon too, and it is high quality, with plenty of flavor; not just the usual salty fat of most bacon. 

I'd come back again."}
{"text":"The wait was about 45 minutes for this Hawaiian breakfast joint.
I had Biscuits and gravy with bacon sourdough toast and 2 eggs the gravy was meh a bit gritty like just before it breaks the eggs were uneventful the bacon was good.
the rest of the crew had;
1. Rick's Adobo Fried Rice\" (adobo fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in  omelette) everyone tried it and liked it.
2. Hawaiian Benedict on a Hawaiian roll with spam and a poached egg covered with brown gravy. this was also good.
3. Piglet omelette bacon sausage and ham and cheddar cheese plate was clean and she had a content smile 
4. Bacon pancakes with bacon pieces in and sprinkled between the cakes maple syrup gobbled down and well liked.
5. Cookie Butter French Toast with whipped cream and nutella dusted with pie crust and powdered sugar. super delicious she had a major sugar hi too.

the staff was friendly and place was clean."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for breakfast and it has it's good and bad points. First things first they do not take reservations here and they will not seat u if you whole party is not present. That being said the wait to get a table here is crazy. We were in on a Saturday morning and the wait time was 30m to an hour for a breakfast joint!!!! We were seated conceded to taking seats at the counter because we had waited 45m and did not want to wait longer for a table. 

Waitress at the counter was nice enough but nothing special service wise.  I ordered the banana pudding pancakes with a side of bacon and my friend ordered the breakfast special. The prices were reasonable but I didn't like that the syrups were an extra cost (wth- where they do that at?) but since I had an embellished pancake I did not need syrup. (Also note no sides are included with the specialty pancakes.) 

Overall the pancakes were really good and the bacon was cook nice and crispy. I do however feel that the pancakes were kind of smallish but still filling. I think the specialty pancake options they have are very original like red velvet, Nutella, various fruit flavors so I would like to go back and try some of the other flavors. Not yet a favorite place of mine but it could happen. I would definitely come back and I think I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading the reviews about the awesome Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm a huge fat kid at heart so anything RV is right up my alley.

There was about a 15 minute wait when we got there (noon on a Monday). The place is pretty small so the wait times are to be expected. The menu is pretty big. They have about 12 different kinds of specialty pancakes, omelettes, crepes, breakfast items and a few lunch selections.

I ordered the omelette which came with 2 pancakes that I of course upgraded to Red Velvet for an additional charge. The omelette was delicious and the breakfast potatoes were pretty good as well. I saved the best for last: The Pancakes. It was like dessert and breakfast all in one. The cream cheese \"syrup\" is more like icing but it gives the pancakes the real RV feel. The pancakes themselves aren't too sweet so it is a perfect balance.

Next time I want to try the S'mores pancakes but that's a whole different review. :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely a try if you haven't visited Babystacks Cafe yet. Go for breakfast. Especially on your day off because you'll want the feeling of not having to go into work after eating the Orange Creamsicle pancakes. 
I also tried the Loco Moco off of a fellow family member's plate and that was very tasty. Considering the Loco Moco isn't my favorite plate lunch, theirs is delicious. I usually go before 8am which there is hardly a wait and the service is amicable. Just like the Terminator, \"I'll Be Back.\""}
{"text":"Delicious all the way around!! Got the famous red velvet pancakes.. OMGEEEEEEE!!! They tasted so awesome just with the whipped cream they placed on top!! Hubby got the loco moco with the garlic rice and it was sooooooooo delicious!! A must if your visiting Vegas!! Totally worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"It's such a treat to have a Babystacks on the Northwest side of town! Definitely is it one of the best dining options there is in the area. 

Baby Chick (Skillet) $9.50 - Mmm-mmm! This is one tasty skillet that has mushrooms, chicken, spinach, and cheese. On top of all that are two eggs cooked anyway you want -- I ordered mine sunny side up, which would've been perfect with some rice on the side. Originally, this comes with potatoes, but I skipped that and saved my carb intake for the pancakes.

The skillet is also served with a side of two buttermilk pancakes, but I requested the Red Velvet pancakes instead -- always a good choice!

Service - We didn't experience any wait time, but the cafe does get busy in the AM. Best to come here early if you want a seat. Even though it was busy, our waiter did a good job taking care of our table. 

Overall - Babystacks Cafe is a great place to sit down and enjoy a filling breakfast."}
{"text":"The service in this place keeps getting worse. If there was a 0 star rating that would be it. How can you enjoy the food with the type of service they offer."}
{"text":"All I can say is:
ORDER THE RED VELVET PANCAKES IF YOU'RE A PANCAKE LOVER! I PROMISE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU IN ANY WAY, IT'S PERF, okay? 

Best breakfast and brunch place ever to exist.
Better than iHop? Yes.
Better than Denny's? Uh, no shit.
Better than Egg Works? Hell yeah.
Better than The Cracked Egg? Don't even, YES!

I highly recommend this to any breakfast/brunch persons cause you will not regret it. I was introduced to BABYSTACKS by an ex-boyfriend and that was probably the most amazing thing he's ever done for me in our entire relationship. Haha, seriously just go"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Fast service and fresh hot food. The red velvet pancakes are a must! Our waiter (Lalo) checked us for coffee frequently and with a great attitude."}
{"text":"The service is great, however the food is just ok. The food reminded me of old food, like it was made and sitting to be served to the people. I do not think I will return. The food is not made with passion, and they are just trying to serve you and sit the next person. 
if you do go get the strawberry pancakes because they were the best thing we had."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place with tons of pancake options.  German chocolate was kinda like eating a brownie for breakfast.  Got the kalua pork benedict and the meat was buttery and flavorful, paired well with the hollandaise which was a bit overapplied."}
{"text":"I loved it here I have red velvet pancakes and honesty it was the best. It was totally worth the drive to come to vegas just to eat here. I would totally come back again."}
{"text":"great breakfast spot, happy its literally across the street from our house.

pros: pancakes are AMAZING! (except for the blueberry pancakes, they're a joke! plain pancakes with a few blueberries on top, wtf?!)

cons: servers are nice yes but service is soooo slow!


i like the decor of the original location, since this one looks cheep but the pancakes are made with love and thats why we keep coming back"}
{"text":"I've am a regular at this location. I normally order the loco moco with garlic rice. This time I went out of the norm to order the adobo thinking can they hold the omelet. Not only I got what I want, it was delicious. (But that's usual) this is the best breakfast spot and the service is always welcoming. 
Tip: they give military discounts and come in before 11am or you will be waiting for min 30 mins for a seat. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great local spot with a Hawaiian flair for huge breakfasts.  Lots of pork, lots of eggs and lots of pancakes.  Tons of choices and they were all good.  I had the fried rice and chicken omelette and it was pretty fine.  The red velvet pancakes with chocolate chips and cream cheese syrup really make this more dessert than breakfast but it was a Vegas style decadent treat.  Lots of locals dining here.  Great food and cheap prices."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning for breakfast.  It was super busy and the tables were packed. They said it would be a 35 minute wait, but we were seated within 10 minutes.  Our waiter acknowledged us quickly and took our drink order and then was MIA for around 10-15 minutes. 

I ordered the Honey French Toast and my partner in crime ordered cinnabun pancakes.  Both were amazing! The french toast had a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream on the top.  So yummy.  

The ambiance was normal for a weekend breakfast place.  We were seated super close to a very annoying family of 4, but we dealt with it. Overall service could be better, but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot for some red velvet pancakes! On the weekends, I always order takeout because the wait is long! Everything here is great! I always get the Portuguese sausage with garlic rice and red velvet pancakes!"}
{"text":"First experience at Babystacks.  We came here to satisfy a craving for pancakes -- my GF thought IHOP would be good but i didnt want corp branded pancakes.

First, our server Efrain, was very pleasant, courteous, friendly and hospitable.  (Thanks Efrain!!)

Next, the menu creativity absolutely is true to the food taste.  Besides the \"menu of pancakes,\" the concept of a \"Benedict menu\" is awesome.  We decided to order the Kalua Pork Benedict plus pancakes.  She ordered the Banana Foster and I had the Carrot Cakes with cream cheese syrup.  Everything was amazing, especially the Kalua Pork Benedict.

Although we came after 10am on Saturday and waited approx 15 minutes to be seated, it was totally worth the wait.  We will certainly return again -- and maybe for lunch as the Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich sounds too good and like it would be heaven in your mouth....."}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressed.  The food quality is above average here.  It seems like the owners picked their favorite dishes from restaurants in Hawai'i & put it all on their menu along with the usual all-american favorites.  We (4 of us) ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict with potatoes, Portuguese sausage with Garlic rice, Banana Fosters pancakes, Adobo Fried rice Omelette, and Red Velvet pancakes. Everything was delicious, with the Kalua Pig coming out as our favorite.  The hostess needs to get to know their dishes to better answer questions at the door, but our waitress was nice along with a timely waitstaff. The only reason they are one star short of perfect was because I felt sick right after & threw up. And continued to feel sick the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast this morning.  I heard to this place from my girlfriend and she wanted to try it out so we gave it a go this morning.  Upon arrival they seemed pretty busy and I thought we were going to have to wait seeing there were only a few tables.  We got to sit down right away.  I've read all the review about how they had poor service or slow service.  Today or at least with us the service was great.  No complaints in that department. 

I ended up ordering carrot cake pancakes and steak and eggs.  It did not disappoint.  The food was nice and hot and delicious.  If I had to complain about anything it would be about how small the restaurant.  I can honestly see Babystacks Cafe outgrowing this building.  If they had a larger building they'd definitely make tons of money because the breakfast was good and I'd definitely go back again.   Babystacks has a Eggworks kinda feel to it but on a smaller scale.  I don't want to say ignore the bad reviews but just prepared for a wait.....and if you don't have to wait then that's a plus.   

The employees have a family feel so I was curious and asked if the restaurant was family owned and the answer was yes.  Definitely give it a go and compliment me like crazy because I'm super awesome!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a better review...I mean its my people...I'm from an island culture, this is supposed to be an island inspired spot, but is was the service that stood out to me...

The food is good but not great...Loco Moco, good, but its not that hard to make and for 8.25, thats a little pricey for that dish. The Adobo Fried rice is good, but similar to a lot of Filipino Adobo at any other Filipino Restaurant and again is pricey. Also, the portions are very average. Its a ten to 12 dollar meal that doesn't really fill you up like island food can, so bring a bag of chips or get ice cream on  the way home  Eggs benedict are good and there are a lot of different styles of it so that cool to try. Red Velvet pancakes are good if you really have a sweet tooth. $4 dollars for three strips of o-k tasting bacon....oh no.....

The service, its a little slow...its gets really crowded, and the servers can be pretty smug...Half of the servers are really hospitable and the other half seem annoyed. We were a big group and we waited about an hour...
My friends Waffles came out so late, that he asked to cancel them...for Waffles....there explanation was that the waffle machine wasn't working correctly and they wanted to make them just right...He cancelled but they still gave it him when our meal was basically done, and they still charged him...really...and they were just O-K.....

I love the ideas in this restaurant, but I expected way more and have had way better food, at a better price with better service.  It was Island style Las Vegas food...."}
{"text":"Pretty ok. Went in at 7AM and service was excellent. The toast was poorly made and had a pool of butter on it. Eggs were cold and served at well before the shortstack. The pancakes were scrumpdidilyumptious so go there for the cinnabun pancakes. Reports were made that the omelet was too cheesy."}
{"text":"Placed an order to pick up on the way back to LA. Got an order of the lemon ricotta pancakes with added strawberries and some adobo fried rice omelettes. The pancakes were good but they only gave me two and the menu states the order should come with three *eye roll*. The adobo omelette is comparable to the one from Aloha Kitchen but tastes a little more like soy sauce and is smaller than size. Didn't care for the hashbrowns, they weren't cooked enough.

Edit: Just got home and we opened our boxes of omelettes. One of our three orders is missing a side. The girl never asked what side I wanted over the phone. So they gave us one with hashbrowns, one with potatoes, and one completely side-less. WHY?! Ripped off by one less pancake and one less side. *eye roll again* now I'm changing this rating from a 3-star to 2.

Overall, food was ok."}
{"text":"Once you try the pancakes here, all other pancakes will be ruined for you! These are hands down the best pancakes I've ever eaten. Very light and fluffy, and surprisingly not as sweet as some of them seem.
I've tried some of their other menu items and they are excellent as well. Everything I see on other people's plates looks delicious. I love small family owned restaurants like this! I've taken all my visitors (family, friends) here and they've fallen in love!
The only downfall is that since it's a really tiny place, there's ALWAYS a wait. They don't take reservations either :("}
{"text":"I think you guys should have a Babystacks Cafe in San Diego!!!  No one has the best tasting Red Velvet pancakes, but Babystacks!!"}
{"text":"If your in Vegas and are willing to drive 5-10 min off the strip, go to baby stacks for an affordable delicious breakfast, it's a Hawaiian style breakfast with every type of pancake you can imagine. Banana fosters pancakes are so good. Yet to have a bad item. Usually pretty busy so get here early or be prepared to wait 5-10 min"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I've never left a review. I LOVE this place for breakfast. It's the best mixture of savory, sweet, and island flavors! My favorite dishes to get here are the adobo fried rice, loco moco, and red velvet pancakes. They have plenty of selections to choose from the sweet or savory side, which I love because breakfast isn't my favorite meal as I think it can get boring but their menu keeps me interested with its variety. Service has always been great for us. I have nothing to complain about with BabyStacks.

One note: Go in as small a group as possible. The wait is usually long if there's more than 3-4 people in a group."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have no complaints! In fact, I plan to go here again for my birthday! I think the idea for this cafe is great because it's a mix of Filipino, Hawaiian and American breakfasts. All they need is chicken and waffles and it's the perfect brunch place!

The first time, I ordered the chicken adobo fried rice and it was awesome. For those who don't know what chicken adobo is, it's a very popular Filipino dish. It's basically chicken cooked with soy sauce and vinegar. My friend ordered the red velvet pancakes and those were amazing! They taste as good as they look!

The second time I went, I had the spam scramble, which was pretty good. Nothing too special though. My friend ordered the Loco Moco, and we both had the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! Again, the pancakes were great!

The place does get crowded because it's not that big so expect a long wait especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Seated quickly.  Clean restaurant. Easy parking. Fast service. Excellent food. 

Upgrade your order to a baby stack on your side pancakes and you will be in heaven! I ordered the Country Fried Steak and Eggs w/ seasoned potatoes and side stack of Red Velvet cakes.  YUM, YUM, YUM! I decided long and hard after mulling over the menu that I needed to have my savory and sweet! Country gravy was made with real ham and not at all heavy.  More creamy and just the perfect amount smeared on the steak.  The potatoes are so good! Like little steak fries! And probably the best part was the Red Velvet Stacks! So incredibly light and tasty, just like a cupcake except topped off with homemade whip cream and dusted with some chocolate shavings! OUR mistake to not include the cream cheese sauce it arrived with was disheartening but I may go without again.  

Hubbs ordered the massive Rick's rice and Egg omlet and it was HUGE! Super tasty too! Never thought that combo of rice inside a massive omlet could be so good. I think that the macaroni salad tasted almost like kimchi and so I could not wrap myself around it.  I was very impressed with the selection of brunch items and the array of stacks that they offer.  I will be back and probably never be able to lose weight because of you, BabyStacks!"}
{"text":"I was really expecting great food after seeing the hype on Yelp. What I got was decent food,  but nothing to write home about. There was a list with the hostess for seating on Sunday. My party of 2 was seated within 20-25 minutes. The service was adequate.  All in all,  I'd eat here again if I happened to be in the neighborhood during breakfast time and they had no line. Otherwise,  skip it."}
{"text":"If I could come here for breakfast everyday I would!  I mean I'd probably weigh 1,000 pounds... but hey it is delicious.  I keep meaning to get different pancakes with my meal, but the red velvet ones are just too good.  I have yet to have something that isn't happiness for my tastebuds."}
{"text":"I visit Las Vegas from LA often to visit family, and since I tried Baby Stacks for the first time I always make it a point to stop here at least once per trip!

There is quite a wait on weekends, so arrive early or not terribly hungry! It's worth it though, I promise. The service is great - servers always attentive and friendly. 

My regular order is usually the spam scramble with garlic fried rice and a side of specialty pancakes. I know it's kind of basic, but I can't help it - it's such comfort food! The furikake sprinkled on top of the rice and eggs is such a nice touch. You also can't go wrong with the pancakes. I've tried many of them (my own and bites off other people's plates) and they're always fluffy and delicious. I believe it's two pancakes you get when it's a side to another entree, which I think is just enough without making you TOO full."}
{"text":"Best regular pancakes in the world!!!  Some how they have depth.   the batter is like a sourdough or artisan loaf of bread.  Pancakes are usually shallow and unrememberable , but i was commenting this to my girlfriend as we were eating these.  I have been told to try the other flavors of pancakes. yum"}
{"text":"I come I here every week on my day off. I love coming here. The food is so good! The waiter knows exactly what I want, the spam scrambler with garlic fried rice. If you haven't been here, I highly recommend this friendly fast food establishment. I rate this a 5+stars!! My food is here. Gotta eat."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were what brought me to Summerlin, and the red velvet pancakes are what made the trip worth every mile.  They were absolutely delicious!  The place was small, but we went around 1:30 in the afternoon and were seated right away."}
{"text":"Went early on a Sunday morning so luckily we were sat pretty fast. Our server was nice and did a good job. I got eggs spinach Benedict and sadly my poached eggs were more hard boiled. No runny yolk at all, my sister got the same thing and her eggs were also way over done. It was still good though, I would go back again. Everyone else's food was made correctly."}
{"text":"Its a small little spot that serves up delicious things!

I had the bacon pancakes which was a typical pancake with bacon pieces in it (center only) which I wasn't to happy about.

Also tried the cinnabun pancake which was magically delicious!! It was also very sweet, so if that isn't your thing stay far far away/

last but not least the eggs benedict which was just average.

Lots of creative pancakes, give them a try."}
{"text":"Bunny's fav breakfast spot in vegas! We always get the adobo fried rice and an order of pankcakes"}
{"text":"This quaint aloha-feel place has some delicious pancakes. There's always usually a wait to dine in, so sometimes Ill pick up breakfast to bring home. I recommend the red velvet or banana pancakes. When it comes to anything else, it's your typical breakfast items. No one can mess up eggs, bacon, or hash right? Service and prices are mediocre. 

One major thumbs down is that there was a few ants on the wall next to my table when I've dined in before. 

They've recently added a new location & I would tell people to check it out at least once for their pancake craving while in Vegas. I'm a waffle person & their pancakes still got me salivating."}
{"text":"This place is about a 20 min drive from the strip, but I enjoyed having brunch here on a Saturday afternoon! The wait was 20 min around 11, fyi.

Yes, of course we had to try the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes, which were sweet and delicious. The short stack split amongst 3 people (1 pancake per person) was enough for us, since it was THAT sweet!

The spinach eggs benedict were delicious, as well as the turkey avocado sandwich (tasted quite healthy and fresh!). This place is decorated with huge butterflies hung on the walls, cute quotes (live, laugh, love) and seats about 40 people. I dig it!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I love BabyStacks. My boyfriend is a huge Cragged Egg fan (which I am not) so getting him to even try this was a struggle. The first time I finally convinced him to give it a try he ordered the chicken fried steak. It was okay, he of course preferred the one at cracked egg, and after tasting it, I agreed. After coming back a next time, he tried the mexican skillet. That's his new go-to. I'm giving only 3 stars because of the service. Coming in for sit down, theres never a problem. Lately we've only been in the mood for take out & its only a minute drive from Desert Shores. The past 2 times we've been, the take out service has been horrible.I don't think I'll be ordering from BabyStacks anymore due to our past 2 experiences. First time, we called in to order the mexican skillet to share. The hostess said it would be about 15-20 minutes. We got there about 20 mins later, thinking we would actually be late because although they say 15-20 mins, it usually never is. It took an additional 20 mins for our food to come out!!!!! 40 mins for takeout on one item? okay, I get it, they're busy.. but PLEASE give me an according time. It bugged me, but I understand it happens, so I let it go. A few weeks later we decided to order the same thing. We called in and its the same 15-20 mins. We got there in about 17 and were greeted by a new hostess. We told her we were here for pickup but she informed us the hostess was in the bathroom and she had not learned the system to cash us out yet (not her fault). So instead of waiting in front of the tiny cashier table because people were sitting on the bench to our left, we took a step back to give the people some room. Upon waiting 5 mins, a group of ladies walked up to the cashier to check out and stood in front of us. While the new hostess watched. My boyfriend wanted to say something but I told him to not to, reassuring him that the new hostess would tell the other hostess that we were there first. 5-6 mins later the hostess came out. I decided to try to inform her that we were there first(nicely) while she was walking towards us just incase the new girl forgot. I started out with \"Hi....\" and immediately got cut off with a \"I'll be right with you\" Being a hostess for 4 years and now a server, I thought that was extremely rude. So she proceeds to the cash register and starts checking out the ladies who stood in front of us, while the new girl watched and didn't say anything. Of course they wanted to spilt their bill. Another 4 minutes. After receiving our food, we took a bite in the car because I was starving, and to no surprise found our food to be extremely cold. The ladies cutting in front of us was not the hostess' fault, but to cut me off trying to tell her, is. I was so upset after this experience; it bugged me so bad I highly doubt I will be returning. Not for a good while at least."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pancake place EVER !!!! I'm obsessed with their German Chocolate pan cakes!! Definitely a MUST TRY if you ever decide to go. I've never had issue with Customer service when I go there, but I do wish the location was larger the wait can be so long sometimes ."}
{"text":"WOOOOOOOOOOOW....breakfast was GOOOOOOOOOOD.
My prior breakfast here was good, but this time it was so much better!
We both ordered the skillet. When it came, it was not at all as I imagined but WOW! It was so delicious. We also ordered a side of pancakes and they were tasty too.
The service was good, the prices were good and the skillet was killer! I am going back again soon to have it again. The potatoes were so tasty. Cooked to perfection!
If you come here, get a skillet. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we were looking for something off the strip and not buffet, and we had the most amazing breakfast here. It did not disappoint. I enjoyed the \"island\" feel of the decor and coziness of the restaurant.  Ordered many dishes off the menu which my girlfriends and I shared. Had the Red Velvet Pancakes which was moist and tasty. A great dish if you like Red Velvet.  Also shared the Bananas Foster pancakes which tasted just like breakfast version of the dessert. Had the Cinnabun pancakes which were deliciously sweet and reminded me of a Cinnabon. Definitely on the sweet side but I'm a fan of sweets.  Also ordered the Loco Moco and I thought their gravy was good. Lolo Ricks Adobo Fried Rice is winner and a must too order. It's perfect with the egg it's wrapped in.  Overall, we had a very enjoyable breakfast which was worth the drive off the strip."}
{"text":"My wife and I drive by one of the other locations to come here. The staff are friendly and the food is great. I take many clients here for an early breakfast meeting."}
{"text":"Best red velvet pancakes in town!  Have tried several others, and these are worth the drive.  As mentioned, all the locations can get packed, so plan for a wait if you're going at peak breakfast time."}
{"text":"I left this place smiling for the rest of the day!!! The waitress was such a sweetheart and was patient, helpful with the menu and always around. I've had the red velvet pancakes, the peanut butter, chocolate and banana pancakes (add whip cream) and the kalua pig benedict and all were to die for!!! Who can beat some mouth watering pancakes starting at $4.95?!?! This place might have a bit of a wait but when you try their pancakes you'll have no idea what is going on around you except for what's in your mouth :)"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal Babystacks customer for the last 8 years and I've never been disrespected by employees until today. I don't know if I will be back and if I do it will just be for the food. 

I called them at 1pm to see what time their last seating was since they close early on Mondays at 2pm. The employee I spoke to on the phone was so rude. I live clear across town (20-25 mins) and called because I didn't want to be refused service after a long drive. I asked the girl on the phone when their last seating was and this is how our convo went 

Me: \"hi I was just wondering what time you guys stop seating\"
Hostess: \"we close at 2 so any time before that\" Me: \"okay are you sure if I show up at 1:55 you guys will seat us\"
Hostess: \"that's before 2, right?\"
Me: \"okay I was just making sure because we are on our way right now\"

So we show up to the doors at 1:50, a time before 2.... right?! And guess what the girl tells us?! Any guesses? 

\"Oh I'm sorry we are actually closed right now\"

Hahaha and in my head I'm like youre f*cking kidding me right? So we ask to talk to a manager and this girl brings out a little teenager and she was trying to tell me to my face \"no we didn't get a call\" \"nope that was a different location\" so rudely and then she asks the girl who brought her out to me \"did you get a call?\" And she says \"yes\" lmao. Oh management, these kids running the business are going to ruin it for you. The fact they had no empathy for the mistake they made was mind blowing. 

If I ever come back to Babystacks it will be for the food and you bet your ass this service doesn't deserve a tip. But honestly I think I will have to boycott red velvet pancakes for a while *kanye shrug*"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite breakfast spot! I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location. 

The coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the \"Banana Cream Pie\" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it.  I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on \"Carot Cakes\" and \"PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips\" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure!

Our server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested \"Portuguese Sausage And Eggs\". He said they have a \"Garlic Rice\" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point. 

They have a great kids menu at affordable prices."}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite breakfast place! I never made it up to the original location. I tried once but the wait was too long. This time around there was no wait on a Monday morning. The interior is fairly large -- much larger than the first location, I'm told -- with several large TVs scattered around the room. For single diners, there's a bar to sit at.

The red velvet pancakes that everyone talks about is as good as advertised. Rich, chocolatey, cakey, but not too dense or sweet to make you think you're eating dessert at 8 in the morning. Apparently, it's a home-made recipe not a prepackaged mix. Topped with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and cream cheese syrup, it's one of the better breakfast items I've had.

As much as I'd like to order it again, there are so many other delicious sounding items on the menu to try. With this place just minutes from my house, I'm sure I'll have the opportunity to make my way through all of them."}
{"text":"PANCAKE LOVERS UNITE!!!!

So so many different delicious options for pancakes! There are a ton of unique flavors of pancakes offered such as banana cream pie, cinnabun, etc. Our table ordered full stacks of red velvet and s'mores pancakes to share. In my opinion, the red velvet pancakes were a little overrated because they were kind of dry unless you covered it with whip cream and cream cheese frosting... But the s'mores pancakes were delicious especially the part of the batter that had chocolate. It was like having dessert for breakfast. Those of you with a sweet tooth will be especially pleased. :)

I'd definitely recommend taking the drive off the strip to come here if you want some good breakfast! Friendly and attentive service. They're only open until three pm so they specialize in breakfast foods and you can sleep in a little and go get brunch after noon. 

Babystacks has savory breakfast items, but I think you MUST order pancakes here at least to share with everyone at the table. My friends had been here before and did not recommend the adobo fried rice that seemed to be a highlight in many other yelp reviews. They said it was gross. This place has a lot of islander (Hawaiian) inspired breakfast items such as a spam scramble or loco moco. The boyfriend and I shared the kalua pig benedict and it was tasty! It was the favorite entree among everyone at our table. The pork was super soft and cooked perfectly, and it went well with the muffin, hollandaise sauce, and poached egg. 

I can't wait to come back. There's still so many more pancakes and entrees that I want to try!"}
{"text":"I live in the Southwest part of Las Vegas and I usually find anything I need here. It takes a lot, something like red velvet pancakes, to make me venture out into another part of town. The possibility of trying red velvet pancakes made my friends and I wake up at 8 am on Presidents Day, drive about 40 minutes to Summerlin, and wait 45 minutes to get a table.  Despite all of that, I would do it all over again just to get a taste of those wonderful pancakes.

My two girlfriends and I shared these three menu items:

Red Velvet Pancakes - yes, it lives up to the hype. The full stack came with 6 pancakes. The pancakes tasted like flat cupcakes and they are to die for. It was the right amount of sweetness. You may expect the whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup to be overwhelming but everything was just right.

Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - Adobo chicken is a traditional Filipino dish so my expectations were a little high on this dish. It came with fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in egg like an omelet. It was very tasty and flavorful. We didn't really dig the macaroni salad. Someone was a little too liberal with the pepper.

Spam Scramble - this was the only dish we didn't care for. It tasted as simple as it sounds... Spam with scrambled egg. I guess we just expected something different. This was something anyone could make at home and make it better.

If I were only rating the red velvet pancakes, I would give Babycakes Café 5 stars, hands down. I love the pancakes so much that I would make the drive out there again on my day off just to get a taste of them again."}
{"text":"My husband and I liked this place a lot. Their pancakes are to die for. When they say full stack they don't just mean a lot of small pancakes stacked together, they mean big and full of taste. My husband had the hash and eggs, he loved the garlic fried rice."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of babystacks' pancakes. I think the hazelnut pancakes, with plenty of strawberries and whipped cream, are generally outstanding. The service here is A+ as well, keeping coffee and water cups full at nearly all times. At this point, you might be wondering: from whence did this four star review come? First, I'd rather give a 4.5 star review. Second, I admit that I've been spoiled by some outstanding breakfasts in my lifetime. Also, I can't order sweet breakfast every time I go out. My only knock on this place is that their savory breakfasts, while still very very good, don't knock my socks off. Again, I haven't had a bad experience here, and I doubt I ever will. Enjoy your delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Small place    long wait   food is pretty good  got the loco mock with garlic rice    rice was simply perfection   burger pattie was paper thin and salty   eggs done well   this is the newer location  very popular"}
{"text":"I could write a book on how good this place is. Menu is flawless.  I've had almost all of it.  Love all of it.  Garlic rice is my clear fav!!!   You just gotta trust me and go and get some"}
{"text":"Service is always good but the wait is always longgggggggggg.   Its worth waiting for though. Garlic rice is awesome.  Any pancake is A++   favorite is the loco mofo and pig grilled cheese.   I order both entrees for breakfast and just have the grilled cheese as a appetizer.  Wish they had groupon or living social deals to make it affordable and then I'd come 2-3x a week vs once a week.  Weekdays are not as busy.   Weekend be prepared for a wait.  You gotta come here.  Great meals.   Great great food"}
{"text":"We put our name on the wait list for 2, then 3 parties came after us, then a young couple came in and got sat right away, the kid working the front then sat 4 parties that came after us, so i decided to look at the waiting list to find our name already crossed out, obviously he gave what shouldve been our table to the young couple that he sat right away, i asked the kid why our name was already crossed out and he had no answer and just sat us right away, wasted over 30mins, i ordered one of the eggs benedict only to have my eggs pretty much hard boiled, the waitress offered to have them remade, but we didnt want to be there and wait any longer and the possibility of having a side of spit on my eggs, so i declined, service sucked and food sucked, get it right the first time and maybe the review would be better"}
{"text":"Okay, our table was wiggly, we tried to fix it, coffee spilled on my head and the waiters grudgingly resat us and made us move our own dishes. Hope the food's worth it."}
{"text":"Great pancakes, rice, eggs Benny, Mexican omelet is delicious! The place is pretty small, and they get pretty crowded, so expect a wait, especially on the weekend. I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes is what you need to try, fluffy and delicious.  I added that to my omelette for $2.00, and was the perfect amount for food.  The omelette was good and made to order.  Hubby had the grilled chicken burger and it wasn't anything to write home about.  Service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Avid yelpers (I don't write a lot of reviews but read Yelp constantly for advice on restaurants and services). 

We visited Egg & I, as well as Omelette House before visiting Babystacks. Both places were good, but Babystacks was outstanding, with original offerings. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was huge, and perfectly seasoned -- really delicious and different. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The Almond Joy and Butterfinger pancakes were heavenly. Surprisingly, not too sweet. Red Velvet were also predictably good based on reviews. 

Service was fantastic. Worth the wait, no question. Excellent value. Loved the fact that all breakfast combos allowed an upgrade to any specialty pancake for a modest charge. Loved it so much -- we will be back before we return to Orange County tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Love it. The cookie butter French toast is going to be a sweet memory.   Definitely coming back next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The RICOTTA PANCAKES are the best I've ever had. 

I like mine with extra lemon and warm butter and its oh soooo good. It tastes similar to a dutch baby but thinner. 

My usual entree is the Mexican Skillet. The salsa they have mixed in there makes the whole dish. It's spicy and citrus-y. The portion is good, not huge like other breakfast places but a good serving for the average person."}
{"text":"This is basically my go to spot for breakfast.  the choices of pancakes, and I am always a sucker of spam and eggs. It is always really  busy so make sure that if you are going in to eat, you have time to spare.  Usually I get it all to go.  I think the biggest problem is the price point for me.  They charge a fair amount, but for the most part everything is solid.  If you are looking for a sweet Hawaiian breakfast joint with some wild flavors for pancakes, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Babycakes, you officially ruined every future trip to Vegas. 

I can not live being within close vicinity to those mouthwatering cakes and not going back. That's right, this place is good enough to take your hungover a** in the car and drive 15 mins of the strip to get replenished by Red Velvet Pancakes. 

My boyfriend was whining and griping about going so far to eat breakfast. I had Babycakes bookmarked for a year, and there was NOTHING that was going to stop me. We got a short stack of the cakes and a spinach benedict to share. After one bite, he was singing the same tune. 

Just what we needed to soak up all the liquor from the night before. Babycakes, I love you."}
{"text":"All of my life's choices have led up to this moment. It was no coincidence that I found this restaurant, it can only be explained as destiny and a yelp app. 

I was in Vegas for a weekend for some friend's birthday and I wanted pancakes for breakfast. Not the tacky boring stuff your face buffet kind but some quality flap jacks.  So where else do I turn to but my yelp app. Thanks people of yelp for steering me and my boyfriend to this neat local spot! I was seriously delighted by the selections and the portions are just right. They have red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, honey wheat, and even strawberry shortcake. I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs with a short stack of bacon pancakes (A slight increase in price for the upgrade, totally worth it.). And my boo ordered the regular sausage and eggs with the banana cream pancakes. He and I both agreed Portuguese is the best way to go because the sausage had a little spice to it that the other sausage could not compete with. Good service, we got our food quickly, and our tummy's were more then satisfied with the portions. We are definitely making this a regular stop on our future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"If you want to wait for mediocre food and be treated like crap by the staff, then this is the place for you! I realize that Hawaiian style food is their thing, but with my experience from living on the islands, this is a poor excuse for a restaurant.  After waiting for 30 min, our food was cold and tasteless. We also waited for 30 min to get our check which was $47 for just two people. And when I complained to the manager, I wasn't offered a coupon or anything, just a fake \" sorry, now pay us the $47 that we don't deserve\".  Don't ever go there !!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the red velvet pancakes alone. Plus we were served quickly even though the place was packed when we came in, which I took as a good sign. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The wait on a Saturday morning for 2 was about 20 minutes. A lot of the people coming in after us walked in and walked out as I guess the wait wasn't worth it. I would have to say my overall experience was hardly worth the wait at all. 

As for the food, I tried the Red Velvet Pancakes and had bites of the Kalua Pig Benedict. I felt there were flaws in both dishes. I loved the crumbled chocolate on the red velvet pancakes but I have had better ones. It seems as if reading \"cream cheese syrup\" on the menu is supposed to hook you in but I felt that it was nothing more than liquidy cream cheese icing, hardly a syrup really. Plus, there was way too much food coloring in the red velvet pancakes because the color was beyond a deep red velvet and more like an unappetizing shocking red color. The Kalua Pig Benedict didn't stand a chance with soggy english muffins. The \"seasoned\" potatoes were bland and tasted like they were straight out of a frozen bag.   

Service here was mixed for me. The hostess was friendly enough considering how busy it was, our waitress was very friendly but the girl at the cashier, the one person actually taking our money didn't provide any customer service at all. A real let down at the end of the meal. 

Super random but every time I look at the BabyStacks Cafe logo, I think of the little people from that Facebook game, Restaurant City haha."}
{"text":"Local haaaaay ---

Can't go wrong with spam anything. 

Must try is the ZIPPY's chili.. close to being in Hawaii itself. *My gf puts mayo in it - try it for yourself.

Portions are good. The food is tasty. Low table tops so expect a wait, especially on the weekends. But there is another location, just sound on Decatur about 10-15 minutes from this Smoke Ranch location on Flamingo & Decatur. 

I did have a squab with the hostess one day, but whatever - didn't like her, still don't like to see her there, but it is something I can overcome just as long as she doesn't include in any part of my service. - tip RUDE Hostess. Without the customers, you wouldn't be employed. 

The servers are always attentive and great. 

ONE Suggestion would be that they should be some local coffee to go with the morning grind!

Love this place. Can't compliment it enough. 

Try everything its great and don't be shy about asking to sub something out that you don't like. They're pretty good at accommodating."}
{"text":"Great food and service however, it needs a major facelift.
Seating is cramped and there's a collection of dust from the vents.
It looks like there's a web of sorts on the emergency sign but it's just dust. Nasty, needs a few hours of tlc."}
{"text":"Been here about three times. I keep trying just because everyone has a lot of good stuff to say about it

So far, I've had the adobo fried rice, the spam scramble and the corn beef hash
I did not like any. I also tried their Garlic fried rice, but it tasted too strong of ONIONS. 

on a better note, their PANCAKES are very good.
Staff is great.
atmosphere with the local/hawaiian music is a PLUS

always busy, so I think im just eating the wrong stuff maybe?IDK but I don't think I wanna spend more money here and be disappointed :("}
{"text":"Arrived on a Wednesday morning at 9am. Was seated right away and had the same server as last time. Love this place. Pancakes are irresistible"}
{"text":"I have nothing to complain about on my first visit. I ordered the loco moco and my husband had orange creamsicle pancakes. The server was very friendly and helpful and had a positive attitude. I love the menu and will come back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"Okay Babycakes, I wanted to love you but I just can't. 

So the bf and I drive about 35 minutes to get to this place, wait about 45 minutes to get seated, order our food and about 15 minutes later they bring out my food and it was wrong..TWICE. Okay, it's not that big of a deal and honestly I wasn't even really that mad because the wait staff was really friendly and it wasn't really their fault. I ordered their spinach Benedict (no bacon) and of course it comes out w/ bacon. Okay, no biggie they bring it back out and the eggs are WAY overdone, like literally hard boiled. Okay, let's try again. They bring it out again and its done perfectly. Their hollandaise sauce was actually REALLY good but by this point my boyfriend was already done eating and after all the waiting I wasn't even that hungry. Their potatoes were not that great at all either. 

My bf did share his red velevet cakes with me and those were deliciouso. Overall, it was a miss for us but if we happen to be on that side of town for some reason, we might give them another shot. The place is really cute and I think we might have a better experience the second time around. Just not really worth driving across town for. 

Sorry babycakes..you're super cute but just not that amazing!"}
{"text":"Vegas trips aren't legit Vegas trips for me without eating at this place! It's definitely worth the wait. Adobo Fried Rice and Red Velvet pancakes are my go-to, can never go wrong with these two dishes. 

Adobo Fried Rice-- the egg wrapping the fried rice like a burrito is cooked perfectly, texture-wise. It isn't salty, lacks a little bit of salt in my option, BUT the fried rice itself is so rich you won't need the extra salt. The fried rice is flavorful AND moist, which is a lot of Asian fried rice lack almost always. The potatoes I ordered was seasoned well --  had a little kick. I believe it had cayenne or paprika. 

Red Velvet pancakes-- I ordered the short stack which was plenty for me. It came with seemingly homemade whipped cream. It was light and tasted very good. It also came with cream cheese syrup -- it was quite thick and sweet, so instead of pouring it all over my pancakes, I just dipped in it every bite I took. The dish was garnished with some chocolate powder and some chunks.

Banana cream pie pancakes-- I didn't have these my last visit but I remember it being creamy and tasted amazing! And I'm not really a big fan of bananas. 

Breakfast burrito-- my girlfriend had this dish. She was very satisfied with it and said it was filling. She could barely finish the last few bites. 

SERVICE-
Very welcoming and genuinely nice. 

Would always come back when I'm in town/State!"}
{"text":"Slightly upset I've neglected trying this place in the many years I've lived in Vegas. On the bright side, I finally came around to getting breakfast here today and was very impressed! 

We ordered 2 \"Build Your Own\" omelettes that were both served with your choice of short stack pancakes. You select from a choice of meat, cheese and toppings; I had turkey bacon, spinach, tomatoes, pico de Gallo, and swiss cheese served on top of roasted potatoes on a skillet- absolutely delicious! We ordered the red velvet and hazelnut as our choices of pancakes- both of which were perfectly fluffy and delightful! The red velvet is their most popular pancake and is served with a side of frosting that I wish I could bathe in tbh- if that doesn't speak volumes Idk what does! 

We arrived around 9:30ish and service was actually pretty quick for a Saturday morning. I'm pretty sure we beat the crowd considering we were seated immediately but by the time we left they had a 30 minute wait. 

Definitely enjoyed my experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is colder then outside and mind youbots 57 outside the air blowing all giest are freezing and one of them asked the server to turn down the air they said no wth i asked as well and said if you dont ill just leave to more of a comfortable enviroment so at least i so t shake while ill eat its so cold wven the qorkwrs are wearing sweaters what doea that twll you"}
{"text":"I consider myself a breakfast enthusiast..........always in search of the BEST!  Today, along with three family members, I ate at a friends brand-spankin' NEW restaurant called Babycakes Cafe on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  I find myself rendered speechless; it was so FANTASTIC!
We're a sharing family, the only way to eat out in my opinion, so I was able to try a little bit of everything.

~If you like a little KICK, eat the Portuguese sausage!
~Rick's adobo fried rice and eggs with macaroni salad.......WTF?  FANTASTIC! 
~Perfectly cooked over-medium eggs!
~Hash browns.....YAY, HASH BROWNS!
~Benny's, oh how I love thee....!
~Lastly, pancakes...........my favorite food of all time!  
        *Red Velvet- Better than actual cake!
        *Bacon- So delish!
        *CARROT CAKE- (SIGH) These are hands down the GREATEST  
          pancakes that I have ever eaten!  I am without words..........!

You'd be doing yourself a favor if you go to Babycakes Cafe!

{"text":"We end up skipping this restaurant a lot because they won't split check. We would go much more often if they would start splitting again. Very annoying. I must say they do have great food and service."}
{"text":"Not only was the food excellent, but the service was as well. Thank you Monica and Cassie."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Be prepared for a lengthy wait on weekends. Lengthy. This place has great pancakes. I've had the bananas foster pancakes and the carrot cake ones and they are both fantastic. The bananas foster was really sweet. Surprised? Their bacon and eggs are also good. I can't recommend the coffee. It isn't terrible, but it tastes a lot like Folgers and it is my only real complaint about the place. I've had good service both times. Definitely recommend this place for a leisurely breakfast on a cheat day."}
{"text":"Babystacks definitely lives up to its hype. Everytime someone asks me where I want to go eat breakfast, I always suggest here if they have not had a chance to try out the delicious Red Velvet Pancakes. Salivating thinking about them..

Ahem, back to the review.

Service here is spotty, but it does not bother me too much because they have never been rude. The longest that I have had to wait here was 10 minutes for a table. The specialty pancakes menu is just so wonderful. I have stuck with the short stack Red Velvet Pancakes each time, but I always take a bite out of everyone else's pancakes. Delicious!

I have tried out the Spam Scramble and their adobo. The adobo, meh. But that Spam Scramble with sriracha on the side was amazing! When I first ordered it, I definitely wolfed it down immediately. I recommend you trying that one out.

You won't regret coming here :)"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast/brunch place in Vegas! They have so many options on their menu, any america breakfast item you can think of it's there! I'm in love with their fluffy pancakes! (The red velvet was bomb) the only thing I didn't really like was the adobo fried rice :( I heard good reviews about this dish but to me the inside of the omelette was bland and not flavorful.. the loco moco was pretty good too. Overall, def try to go there for the pancakes, they legit have every flavor possible!"}
{"text":"We just found our breakfast place.   So close to home.   Asian Pacific food from adobo, Spam and corned beef.  I'll add more next time when I try the rest."}
{"text":"Came here strictly for the red velvet pancakes. Only place in the area that has them available and ready, and not over 45 minute wait. I was pleasantly surprised to see they have a lot of local/Hawaiian options and fusion dishes. I'm a big fan. Try the adobo fried rice, or chilli skillet. Go outside your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Came here wanting to try it for several years after hearing good reviews. My experience didn't go as well. Ordered sausage, scrambled eggs, and a crepe. The sausage were cold on the inside and obviously raw in some places. I asked the server to send them back and within 1 min and a half they were given back to me, having been obviously thrown in the deep fryer. They were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside. In gave up and just laughed it off, as this is really unprofessional in my opinion. The crepe was mediocre and underdone too. Two stars are for my server, who was very nice and attentive and kept my coffee cup full."}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for breakfast!!! I know most people rave about their red velvet pancakes but the honey french toast was so tasty, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It might be a bit of a wait to be seated but it is definitely worth every minute! This is definitely a place locals go to enjoy low key, fantastic breakfast."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Great prices and great food...can't get better than that. 

Had the Adobo Fries Rice Omelet & Banana's Foster Pancakes. They were AWESOME!  Can't wait to go back and try the Kahlua Pig Grilled Cheese and the Red Velvet Pancakes. Definitely our new breakfast place."}
{"text":"It was a seemingly normal Friday morning when everything changed.
My daughter and I strolled into BabyStacks by chance and although there was a wait, for some reason, we knew it would be worth it.
We agreed to share the seasoned potatoes.
She ordered the seasonal Easter Pancakes which were just as adorable as they were delicious.
And I had the Bananas Fosters Pancakes. Hands down, some of the most decadent substance to ever enter my mouth. With each bite I took, I wanted more and more. I was hooked. I wish I had some in or around my mouth right now.
That's what she said.
Ha!
I can guarantee you, if you eat here, your stomach will thank me.
And it's moderately priced, so your wallet will thank me too."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time on Saturday Morning 5/28. We were told it would be a 25 min wait. Waited a good 20 minutes. I ordered the Moco Loco with Garlic Rice with a side stack of Butterfinger Pancakes. DELICIOUS!! Everything was so good. My husband had the Adobo Fried Rice and that was so good too! Even the Pineapple Ice Tea! It is safe to say that this will be my new spot every time we go to Vegas. The only \"down\" side (if you would even call it a down side) was the long wait for the food to come to our table but it doesn't even matter!"}
{"text":"Was told 25-30 min wait, took nearly an hour to be seated. During my hour wait I was watching other people be seated way quicker than my party of 2.  Once we were finally seated we watched people who were seated after us get their drinks and orders taken before we were even greeted by our waitress. They're struggling to keep up with the volume they have, and service is sub par.  My $10 bacon and egg plate had over cooked bacon and I could have gotten a better plate at a local casino for $1.49. It also came out 15 minutes before my kids pancakes so it was cold by the time I got to take my first bite... not impressed."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE.  Definitely need to go to the gym before and after though.  Specialty pancakes instead of bread with almost all dishes for an extra buck or two.  I recommend the Cookies n Cream (which have been a constant special for months), or peanut butter banana.  Huntington skillet is awesome, as is the breakfast burrito.  I have been there several times and there is always a wait, but it is worth it.  Highly recommend.  :)"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes were great, but the wait was over an hour long. Will return..hopefully the wait is not too long next time."}
{"text":"Perfect pancakes! Danielle was an amazing server! She was super friendly, attentive and made great recommendations for our first time! We tried the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet and the Banana Foster Pancakes. The omelet was delicious and full of flavor, but the pancakes were definitely my favorite part of the meal! Light, melt in your mouth pancakes with a sugary salty caramel on top with warm bananas and a perfect dollop of fresh homemade whip cream! Thanks for the great service and meal!"}
{"text":"We recently visited Babycakes for brunch. This place is yummy and reasonably priced. We had the kalua pork eggs benedict (the pork was SO good), huevos rancheros (green chili was top notch) and a nutella crepe. Everything was excellent and the service was very good. Only downside to this restaurant is that it is small and there was a long wait, even for just 2 people. So don't come if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Perfect hashbrowns. And dear god, the Carrot cake pancakes.... Mmmmmm. I think I died and went to breakfast heaven! 

Every weekend I consider driving from Southern California to Vegas just for the Carrot Cake Pancakes."}
{"text":"Awesome place and friendly service, my kids love their specialty pancakes!
 I like how friendly and attentive the servers are.
 Even when it's busy it is worth the wait:)"}
{"text":"There is a slight wait when it comes to this place.  Honestly, I'm not very impressed and it does seem overrated.  It's not so great. The rice was very dry and the eggs were overdone. It's like any other diner breakfast spot. I don't see anything extremely special about it. The pancakes were alright. Big I guess. Meh. The service is also not the greatest the two times I came."}
{"text":"A must see. The place is a tad small but very friendly. The Red Velvet pancakes are a must... Light, fluffy and all together a good tasting pancake without that cakey taste. It's not as \"red\" as the pics on Yelp. They were also willing to do a egg white omelet with no problem. Choose a time and be willing to wait a bit, it's worth the wait and everyone was super nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in after hearing all the raves regarding the red velvet pancakes and the kalua pig benedict....Noticed a few local hawaiian and filipino dishes-portuguese sausage, loco moco, spam, adobo fried rice omelette and kalua pig!? for breakfast???

So I ask my waitress if the owner was from Hawaii....\"No, she's not from Hawaii, she's just been there a few times\" Uh-oh.............I take my chances anyway and go with the benedict and forego the potatoes and pay a little extra for a side of the red velvet pancakes.

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and an egg is really hard to screw up, but these cooks did a great job at that. I felt like I was cutting into an egg mc muffin because the yolk wasn't oozing like it should have if you know how to poach an egg. Hollandaise looked and tasted instant and I know wasn't made fresh. And how are you gonna have carnitas pass as kalua pig? same meat, different preparations....definitely lacking saltinesss and smokiness you get from properly made kalua pig....definitely failed on execution here.

Red Velvet Pancakes were good and I'll just stick to the non-local items if there is a return visit. Some may disagree on my 3-star rating, but being a stickler for 
good food DONE RIGHT, I call it like I taste and see it and I'm sticking to my guns......BANG BANG!!!!.......................................................ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast because wifey's never been, and its a favorite within the Yelp Las Vegas community.

Not only is it my favorite meal of the day, but I almost always have to get a savory item AND a sweet item. Wifey kept it simple and ordered Cheesy scrambled eggs and hash browns with an upgrade of Rocky Road pancakes. I had the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, substituted the macaroni salad (but still got it anyway) and  upgraded to their famous Red Velvet Pancakes. I love banana pancakes and banana cream pie, so  I had to try their banana cream pie pancakes as well.

I KINDA SORTA FORGOT two important words though.......

Short Stack.........DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Must've been a sign of hunger!)

I killed my omelette and  we both preferred the Red velvet pancakes as the rocky road ones sounded better than it tasted. Out came the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes, and that plate of 6(or was it 8???) pancakes was enough for 2-3 people! I dug in and wow! were they good! It felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast. I also kinda wish they would've toasted the almonds for added flavor though, just sprinkling them on raw didn't do any justice.

Anywho, although I didn't kill it, I did some serious damage leaving just one pancake  left. \"Whoa!, you really put a dent in those pancakes!\" A table next to us said...\"Are you a competitve eater?\" \"No, but I did have 80 pieces of sushi in one sitting, and put away a 12 scoop bucket of ice cream with the works in an hour.\" I replied........ALOHA!!!

{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(129/365) \"Babystacks #3\"

Checked out this spot which is in our hood and seems like this location has consistency issues. Luckily for us, we didn't run into any issues with our orders.
Babystacks is known for having Hawaiian style breakfast items influenced by a well known spot on Oahu, and If I see comfort foods like Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and Loco Moco, You better believe that's what I'm goin' for!

Our server Mike (who was also one of the managers) was great the whole time, offering suggestions, checking up on us constantly, and even took some time to chat with us and even after our meal, invited us back to try the Cookie Butter French Toast, one of his personal favorites, Which I've already made at home a few times...;)

Wifey ordered the Hawaiian Style Breakfast Sliders with Portuguese sausage, eggs, and cheese on Hawaiian sweet rolls and added on Bacon Pancakes with maple Syrup and I decided to go with the Loco Moco with a side of their popular Red Velvet Pancakes. They also had a Kalua Pig Benedict which sounded good but when it comes to anything benedict, I just do it up at home, because I have come to the conclusion that no one here knows how to perfectly poach an egg! (at least in all of my breakfast experiences here)

Wifey enjoyed her sliders and I thought my Loco Moco was pretty good. Both the Bacon and Red Velvet Pancakes were delicious, But my faves are still Du-Pars and the Sweet Cream Pancakes at 50's Diner. Wecome to the neighborhood Babystacks!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Very delicious food and mouth watering menu so many different kinds of things makes it hard for you to choose just one thing to eat but that's why you can always come back and try different things each time you visit I will always have this place on my mind when I'm visiting this part of Vegas it's so very yummy it's like visiting a family who loves to make delicious things for you each and every time you visit them and that's what will keep me coming back for more yummy delicious things to eat and enjoy every single time"}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of a friend and I can truly say that this was one of the best breakfast spots in Vegas. I had the red velvet pancakes. They were more like red Suzy Q's but I'm not complaining. Customer service here was excellent. We had a large party and everything was perfect. Will be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places to go. The smores pancake is really good and one of the best. The Adobe fried rice is really good too."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  The pancakes ordered for my family(red velvet, white chocolate/macademia and bacon)  were delicious.  Every bite gave me a smile!
     The two things that I remember from that meal that could improve the customer's experience is: the long wait(we came in for a Thursday brunch and waited for longer than 30 minutes) and the portions(considering the prices charged).
     If you're in the mood for pancakes, this is spot!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at babystacks for years now. This is one of my favorite restaurants because they have my absolute favorite loco moco! 

My boyfriend and I come here so often that the servers feel like family and they give us hugs every time or ask us how we're doing. Which I think is very sweet. 

But I'm reviewing today deducting one star because of the very slow service I received today. My friends and I came here after class to just have a quick brunch. But we ended up having a 2 hour brunch because of the wait times for our seat and our food. I've been here too many times to know that this place is small (about 13 tables total) and there is usually a wait to be seated. Today we were sat down after 15 minutes of waiting (which isn't bad) and then right when we sat down the busser gave us our drinks. The downside was waiting for our food. I felt like we waited for our food for about 40 minutes, which didn't feel like the usual serving time that babystacks had. I would say it might be because the kitchen was backed up, but I have seen this place more packed and I have gotten my food way sooner. When we got our food we were finally ready to eat, but my pancakes are missing and my server told me it will be right out. But it literally has been about 30 more minutes, my friends have eaten all their food and my pancakes are nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, I'm just observing the other tables get all their food already. Finally I get it, but I didn't really have an appetite for it anymore... it would have been nice if I was accommodated some way, but I was still charged for the pancake that was pretty much irrelevant my entire dining experience today.  

P.s. Our usual servers weren't there. They're usually much more efficient."}
{"text":"The hype is real lol. Great customer service, even though we waited for about 30 minutes for a table the staff made sure that we would be seated soon and even though they were super busy somehow they still had a smile on their faces. We tried the adobo fried rice, Loco moco, red velvet pancakes and their cookies n cream pancakes. The adobo fried rice was flavorful, you can taste the traditional adobo flavors and the garlic fried rice. I'm not a huge fan of red velvet BUT I'm glad I tried it, you can actually taste the red velvet flavor and it wasn't too sweet even with the cream cheese frosting on the side. The cookies n cream pancakes tastes exactly like an oreo, you will not be disappointed. The Loco moco was okay, maybe we'll try the chili one next time. If you want a filling meal away from the strip you must stop by here, they have multiple locations!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. My friend found this place thru yelp and it am so glad she did. The red velvet pancakes were out of this world. I don't really care for red velvet or pancakes that much but I scarfed these babies down. Would highly recommend over and over again."}
{"text":"BabyStacks we gotta talk. We've known each other for a long time, you took my red velvet pancake virginity away, but its time to part and go separate ways. I have to... eat different egg benedicts... you know???

Back in the day there was a ton of hype for BSC, all my friends were uploading pictures of their glorious pancakes. Now that hype is over and being an egg making master I've become disappointed with the eggs. The previous visits I've always had eggs that are overcooked, makes me sad. The portions have gotten smaller and isn't exactly the cheapest spot in the neighborhood. These days my tooth isn't as sweet anymore to devour their variety of pancakes. I've always thought $3 for a smaller glass of orange juice is a bit high. 

While BSC does have an array of Hawaiian breakfast items, it just doesn't scream excellence or cause any cravings. However if you are determined to have your first meal of the day at BSC, my favorites were the kalua benedict, the Huntington skillet, and carrot cake pancakes. 

Service has always been fine, water gets refilled, no problems with the bill, and orders are correct.

Au revoir BSC!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Get there early to grab a table and bring a sweater because they keep the AC cranked up! I love the cinnabun pancakes, but they also have a lot of other great flavors. Their crepes are awesome also."}
{"text":"Oh baby, BabyStacks Cafe. I am so happy I ventured off the strip to eat here. And I will definitely be back every time I am in Vegas - and you should too.

Filipino fusion breakfast food. Amazingly delicious.

Our table ended up ordering the same thing - Cora's Corn Beef Hash & Eggs $10.95. You can choose to have it with potatoes or hashbrowns, 2 eggs any style, and it comes with regular pancakes.  I got mine with eggs over medium, garlic rice (extra $1) and nutella pancakes (extra $1). My friend got it with eggs over medium, hashbrowns, and macadamia nut pancakes. My other friend got it with eggs over medium, potatoes, and lemon ricotta pancakes. There was no talking at breakfast. And every morsel was eaten. So incredibly flavorful and delicious!

They also bring you a smorgasburg of hot sauces with your food - you don't even have to ask. The menu is extensive and they have all sorts of pancakes and specialties (our neighbor table got the Kalua Pig Benedict and the Loco Moco and was raving about it).

Service was great! Restaurant was super clean and a chill, mom and pop ambiance. If you make a reservation, they won't seat you unless your whole party is there -so respect the rule. They weren't busy when we arrived at 9am, but other reviewers say the place gets packed so be ready for a wait if you aren't there early!"}
{"text":"The best red velvet pancakes ever. It just melt in your mouth! you gotta try it! The loco moco was good too but not the best. My vegas is not complete without eating their red velvet pancake!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here when I'm in Vegas.  The food is so flavorful and the pancakes are great. I love all of the different types of pancakes they have up for offer.  Be hungry when you come....they serve generous portions!!

Reccomended:
Nutella pancakes with strawberries 
Portuguese Sausage Plate"}
{"text":"I met a friend there yesterday for breakfast.  I really wanted to like this place because everyone was so friendly.  Yes there is quite a wait but my friend and I were catching up so it went by quickly.  From the looks of the menu, I wanted to order everything.  Being part Filipina from Hawaii, it was refreshing to see the food had that same ethnic vibe.  I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs, & garlic fried rice.  I really didn't like the texture of the corned beef hash.  It was too processed, and like another Yelper noted, reminded me of dog food.  The garlic rice was good, like my mom's.  I also didn't care for the pancakes.  They tasted very strongly of baking powder.  I can't remember what my son ordered but he ate it all without complaints.  My friend, also from Hawaii,  ordered the Loco Moco and ate all of hers.  She ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and again, the taste of baking powder was overpowering.  The cream cheese syrup was good.  My son ate the rest and liked them.
  
I am not completely turned off by the place and want to give them another try.  Perhaps the pancakes were just bad that day?  I want to try other items on the menu.  I think it's great there are Hawaiian-style breakfast items on the menu even though the owner is not from Hawaii.  Oh yeah, we were told that the chili on the menu is Zippy's chili!!!

I will be back here and hope to upgrade this review."}
{"text":"Slow service, but excellent food!!! This place is pretty small and crowded, wish you guys would take reservations!"}
{"text":"Came here on Mothers Day. While the wait was pretty long (as I expected) the food was delicious. Our server seemed a little scatterbrained but that was probably due to the holiday. Also, the price was very fair."}
{"text":"Great food!  Unique flavors and selection!  They get busy specially on weekends.  But if u have time you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious, heads up there might be a line to get in it is so tasty. The place was really tiny but the food and service was so good I didnt even mind too much."}
{"text":"First timer - Came in looking to feed this Halloween hangover. Hit the spot for sure!! Food was delicious. Now I'm going back to bed."}
{"text":"They told us 1/2 hour wait and it's been over an hour.  One of those experiences. I let the girl know and believe me I'm nice about it and she was a bit snippy.  Hopefully the food is good and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I waited 6 years..  heard about this cafe for a while now. And it did not disappoint.  Jacob was awesomr server. Good customer service.. good food.. 
Red velvet macadamia nut pan cake .. big stack small stack.. soooo good.chicken fried steak. Loco moco and corned beef hash...will definitely  come back. Awesome..good job Babystacks!"}
{"text":"Babystacks has the best pancakes ever! I am somebody who loves to get pancakes alot and before coming here considered ihop the pinnacle of pancakes. But after coming to this place my life was changed forever. Babystacks has the most fun options to choose from like shmores or rocky road pancakes just to name a few but they have soo many more along with a monthly specialty pancakes which follow the theme of the month. The service here is always great and I never leave hungry, give this place a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Moved here from Hawaii and was missing home! Came in for breakfast and the food was amazing! Reminded me of home! Everyone is super friendly and the music take me back for sure! Wonderful breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"To start the wait is not as long as it seems or as the hostess state ( hostess not customer service friendly at all actually almost left due to them) , thank goodness we didn't because the server ( Maritza) has been one of the best in vegas her soft spoken voice and great memory is amazing . Thank you . On top of this all the food was great , hash browns not my fave but overall good food , we will be back and hope for better HOSTESS"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous we loved every bite everybody should try this place and we will be back thank you so much"}
{"text":"It's no joke when people say Las Vegas is the 9th Hawaiian island.  And when I walked into BabyStacks Cafe, I honestly felt like I was walking into a restaurant at home.  Hawaiian music playing in the background, local Hawaii people abound inside... In a strange way, it reminded me of Koa Pancake House in Hawaii, but BabyStacks certainly has a much better and more diverse menu.  From eggs to pancakes - there is something for everyone!! The pancakes it seems are their speciality as they have everything from whole wheat pancakes to red velvet.  And the food portions are HUGE!  The pancakes were great.  Chewy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Their omelette was also huge!   The menu is seriously overwhelming with so much to choose from."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I get the Ricks Adobo almost every time, which is marinated chicken and rice in an omelet. The pancakes are good too, as I have dabbled in some. There Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are amazing. Good prices, good portions, and friendly staff. The only downside can be actually getting into Baby stacks.  The location is small, and due to the awesomeness of the food, its very busy. If your in a hurry though, you can call ahead and have the food ready for take out! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I applaud the success of BabyStacks, but expecting your customers to stand packed elbow to elbow in the waiting area for upwards of an hour in hopes that you can hear your name being called is horrible.  The lack of reservation options, lack of waiting space, and unfriendliness of the staff offsets anything good I have heard about the food itself. I won't be attempting this place again anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Our definite go to spot for breakfast on Sunday's. So convenient and so good. If you get there before the 9am rush you'll get seated right away. Anytime after that there's a hefty wait but that's just because it's so good. Everyone is friendly and the service is quick. They also just recently started splitting checks if needed."}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfast here many times and at different locations and it is always good.  I have tried most things on the menu and they are all tasty.  The seasoned house potatoes are the way to go, fried properly and well seasoned.  The only breakfast item that I found mediocre was the biscuits and gravy, but then again it is extremely rare to find a restaurant that makes proper biscuits and country gravy.  The pancakes are also all delicious. Great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices.! So many different pancake options! The skillets are good too! Even on a busy sat morning, only waited 10 min to sit and received friendly service."}
{"text":"Over the top delicious. We're visiting Vegas and my daughter fell ill, so we had to head off-strip for urgent care. Found this place through Yelp and am so glad we did. I had the adobo rice omelet and as a non-breakfast foods person, can't say enough about it. SO good I know I'll be thinking about it next time I'm hungry. Also had the red velvet pancakes which were AWESOME. Service was great, too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met to eat at Babystacks during our lunch break from work. We were seated promptly at a table right in the front of the restaurant.   It was a freezing day and every time someone would open the front doors a huge gust of icy cold air would rush over us. It took a long time for our food to come out. Only my Eggs Benedict were served, so I had to eat it before my husband's burger came several minutes later or it'd get cold. Right away I noticed it's appearance was pretty sad. Also, the eggs were hard cooked, not runny at all. I notified the waiter, who asked if I wanted it remade. I had to decline due to time constraints.  Their bathroom was pretty nasty. It was smelly and the grout is disgustingly filthy. Our waiter didn't bring our bill, so we just went up to the cashier and the clerk there printed it up for us. My husband's burger was decent though. The Eggs Benedict at The Original Pancake House (Fort Apache & Flamingo) blows this place' out of the water. 0% chance of ever returning."}
{"text":"LOVE IT HERE! my favorite, Loco Moco with garlic rice and a side of red velvet pancakes. My kids loves chili Moco with regular rice and a side of cookies and cream pancakes. They didn't have chili today so they got chicken strips. My other son for spam scramble, always good too! My hubby usually gets either the Kalaha pork sandwich,  he likes that too.  Today he tried the Adobo fried rice. It was yummy. Lots of eggs but the filling was good.  We Co e here every visit to Vegas.  So worth it prepare for lines,  usually 20 to 25 mins. Packed waiting room area. They don't split check or seat incomplete parties. No reservations."}
{"text":"This place here is Pancakes on steroids, some many flavors to choose from. I have found my permanent breakfast spots. The omelets are good as well. Big portions nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience! We walked in and were told there would be a wait of about 20 minutes to seat the three of us. Not five minutes later we were called as our table was ready!  Service was quick and friendly. The meals were delicious! One must try the signature red velvet pancakes!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Las Vegas!  I found this place when my Dad moved to Summerlin a little over 4 years ago and we at least once every time I visit.  
If you love pancakes, this is the place for you.  They have two dozen different types of pancakes.  The hazelnut, cookies and cream are my favorite.  My dad loves the strawberry and gets a short stack of those every time.  
The service here is friendly with a smile on their faces and they are great about keeping coffee refilled.  
Definitely a must if you are in the area!  I will miss it since we are moving my dad to California this weekend.
Thanks for 4 1/2 years of great food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever! Red Velvet are my fav!"}
{"text":"The two recent times that I've been here, I came for the garlic fried rice.

1st time, it tasted more like ONION fried rice than anything and no taste. Needed salt.

2nd time, I gave it another shot; and although it wasn't onion fried rice like the previous occasion...there still wasn't any taste. They don't like to use salt, apparently."}
{"text":"Try the red velvet pancakes, my little piece of heaven. I always get an extra icing on the side"}
{"text":"Called for a to go order and was on hold for 10 min and decided to just drive to the place and order there. Cashier name Vernice/Bernice needs an ATTITUDE CHECK AND CUSTOMER TRAINING! Got to the place and I was next in line to get help, she still decided to take the parsing after me. Plus my garlic rice were saggy like it's been sitting on oil. This place used to be nice to go but the people working here are making it worst. Vernice/Bernice finally got my ordered and I asked for my red salsa because she forgot and gave me more attitude like it was
My fault. Never again with this place. Go to EGG & I or EGG works with better service."}
{"text":"This is my second time to eat here...this time i brought my mom with me..she kinda hard to please... we absolutely loved the food. It was served quick hot and freash...Our server was super pleasent  and checked on us several times even while it was busy. We will be coming back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes hands down, love this place. Usually I get the loco mocco (which is amazing) and get carrot cake pancakes on the side. Never ever Let down. 5 star for sure baby!"}
{"text":"We had the kahula benidict and the red velvet pancakes. Both were excellent, and the service was fantasic. They were very kid friendly."}
{"text":"You want breakfast this is the place. Never had the same thing twice and they haven't disappoint. Very busy so it will take some time"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend and fellow yelper Tracie p we went around lunch time we both were virgins of this place but read such good reviews on yelp about it so we decided to try it.

We were looking forward to the Red velvet pancakes and all the hype about them so we shared a half order of them. Unfortunately they did not live up to all the hype, we were both expecting red velvet pancakes but got pancakes with food coloring we were pretty disappointed. The pancakes were not fluffy goodness but yet a weird texture not to tasty and the \"cream cheese syrup\"  tasted like that frosting you would put on those cinnamon rolls you get at the grocery store. 

Now on the flip side I ordered the Huntington omelet which had cheddar cheese, bacon and avocado which came with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes i got the \"seasoned potatoes\" which were not seasoned one bit and i also got an english muffin which was good but how can you mess that up. The omelet was pretty tasty how can you go wrong with cheese bacon and avocado , nothing that great but it was good. 

Overall it was an ok experience I was pretty disappointed I expected it to be way better because of all the reviews on yelp. I probably wont return here because there are better breakfast places out there."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here over the weekend and man does it fill up fast in there!  It's a small location and by the time I left, there was a huge crowd gathered outside waiting for tables.  I had the Cinnabun pancakes with a side of bacon crispy.  Everything came exactly as I ordered it and the bacon was the perfect amount of crisp without being burnt.  Unless you're sharing the pancakes, a short stack is plenty.  I wound up bringing half of my full-stack home with me.  My only complaint is that when I reheated the pancakes, the salt taste really came out and they tasted horrible reheated.  They were delicious when they were fresh, but I don't know what happened between the restaurant and home.  

If you're an indecisive eater, this is not the place for you.  The menu has sufficient options to keep you trying to decide for days.  It's great for those of us who like to try different things each time though!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast that reminds me of Hawaii because of the loco moco, Portuguese sausage and kahlua pork. It even has adobo rice! Oh, and did I mention pancakes?! The red velvet pancakes are a family favorite.
It's not a Hash House or fancy brunch spot, but it hits the spot and not your wallet."}
{"text":"I had Lolo's Adobo Rice Omelette. I definitely recommend it! The lemon ricotta babystacks are delicious too."}
{"text":"My wife went there today with her friends. Another bad meal. She ordered scrambled eggs and hash browns. The eggs and hash browns were not cooked enough. This place just can't do anything right."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place hands down. Been going here for years little pricey but good  food."}
{"text":"The food was a 3, service a 2.

Service first: understandable that as a busy restaurant, you require everyone in the party to be present before you can sit them. HOWEVER if it's 30 minutes before closing, the restaurant is practically empty, and the people who are present are willing to order for those coming in 5min or so, you'd think they'd sit the party instead of having them wait outside in the heat.

Food: got two of their signature items (red velvet pancakes and Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice). Both were just ok. The fried rice was a little too salty while, as a huge red velvet cake fan, I was a little disappointed by the pancakes (though the cream cheese \"frosting\" was good). Also tried my sister's baby chick skillet and again, just ok. Not sure why this is on best breakfast lists ..."}
{"text":"It's funny just yesterday I was telling a friend it's hard to mess up eggs but I ordered the Huntington Omelette and carrot cake pancakes. I don't know how the eggs were actually dry and hard to cut through with a fork...thats odd. I went ahead and covered them with hot sauce so they would have some flavor. The potatoes were cold and old. I didn't eat very many of them. I know what leftovers taste like. I did come in at noon so maybe I got the remains of the breakfast rush. The pancakes were good but a little unremarkable. I guess once you've had Stacks and Yolks nothing else will ever compare. I will not return but I will drive 30 minutes to go to Stacks and Yolks...their pancakes are HUGE. So much better than this place."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time here so i knew what to expect. My usual Adobo Fried Rice Omelette (amazing!!) but this time went with a short stack of their bananas foster instead of my usual macadamia nut pancakes. Totally the perfect choice for my morning sweet tooth. Now my breakfast date went with the cowboy Omelette and the tarimisu pancakes. The cowboy omelette was just ok to me but the tarimisu pancakes would be perfect for the less of a sweet tooth. Oh and by the way go with their home potatoes instead of the hash browns or fries. So far all my experiences have been positive here at this location. Haven't tried their two other locations in Vegas but hopefully they are just as good food and service as the Flamingo/Buffalo location."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Butterfly decorations on the wall. Some tables were too close to each other.

LIKE  The same great menu as the other location. Friendly server.

LOVE  The delicious pancakes (especially the limited caramel apple one). The Hawaiian breakfast items."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Eccentric decor. Only open til 2 or 3pm.

LIKE  The service.

LOVE  The Hawaiian menu items. THE PANCAKES!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going here and my last. I called in my order so I could just run in and pick it up. Mistake one. I go in thru the mobs of people there waiting and tell them i have a pickup order. I get a ticket only to wait in another 2 mile long line to pay. Really? Why don't they have a separate line for take out orders? I sat in line for a good 10 min while my foods sitting there getting cold. I get it home and yep was cold and disgusting. Not sure what the rave is on this place but it was first and only time coming here. Maybe its different eating there but I think I'll save the money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. I got the western skillet with 2 buttermilk pancakes (included or with toast instead). Restaurant was busy. About a 10 minute wait. Service was good even though they were busy. Restaurant looked clean. Dining area is not very huge. This wouldn't be the location I would pick for a big group. 2 person tables are kind of small for all the plates and stuff they bring out for breakfast. Skillet was good, pancakes were great. They have a bunch of specialty pancakes too.  It's a must try if you are a pancake fan"}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes. Oh My Delicious. super good. Great food as well."}
{"text":"Always a place we visit while in Vegas.  Expect to wait but it typically isn't too bad since they get you in and out pretty quickly.  If you are looking for low carb options, highly recommend ordering the side orders of 2 eggs and the Kalua pork."}
{"text":"Only reason it's a 4 is because it's always busy in there.  The food is AMAZING and the pancakes are unique and love the variety of flavors."}
{"text":"Probably the best stack of pancakes I've ever had. I got chocolate chip. The chocolate was not so overpowering. It's been over 24 hours and I'm still thinking about them ahhahah"}
{"text":"I guess we picked the wrong day!  First day in town, couldn't wait to go here for breakfast.  Sorry to say not good.  Food delivered lukewarm.  Coffee REALLY tasteless.  We had tried another location (not good) and decided to come back here since it was the first one we went to and enjoyed.  Servers really need a personality!  Back to IHOP."}
{"text":"Baby stacks is a good delicious place. We came here for breakfast and they give you a really big breakfast.. The staff was friendly and great customer service our waiter made sure our cups were never empty. We will be coming back, thank you!"}
{"text":"Hostess: \"It's 'restaurant policy' not to seat you until you're 'a complete party.'\"
Me: \"My daughter is on her way and I only have 50 minutes to eat before my dentist appointment.\"
Hostess: \"I'm sorry, Ma'am. I can't seat an 'incomplete party.' Restaurant policy.\"
Ever heard about that little policy called, \"customer service?\" It prioritizes the customer's needs above the restaurant's financial gain! Am I being unreasonable?"}
{"text":"It's my first time coming here and the place is pretty good. I like they're menu choices ill be sure to come back again. Try the Kalua Pig Benedict for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok so they get busy and sometimes you have to wait
We have had both great and mediocre service
The good stuff, the food
Every pancake flavor is great, cremesicle, red velvet, lemon ricotta, to name a few
My favorite sweet creme crepes with or without fruit
Coffee is decent but everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee
Is without a doubt a breakfast must try."}
{"text":"This place has the best red velvet pancakes on the planet, outside of the ones we make at home.  

I've visited and ordered pickup this location several times and always have received good food and super friendly service.  The food always arrives quickly.  It's almost like they know what you are going to order before you do!  The takeout is always packaged properly and thoughtfully.  

The dining area is small but pleasant and is always very clean.  The menu has something for everyone, including an extensive list of various types of pancakes."}
{"text":"Kalula pork instead of beef patty on the Loco Moco.... YUM!  And I swear the hubby thought he heard angles sing when he tried the Banana's Foster Pancakes!  To DIE FOR!!"}
{"text":"Actually 4.75 stars in my book (The knock down for the clustered front entrance ) .... went here on my random day off from work and was very happy I did.... Have drove by here twice on the weekend but it was way too busy for me to take my time to get out of my mustang ..... set up the wheelchair .... and wait an hour to get in .... Thought to myself \"This place MUST be good!!\" Even still on a Wednesday 12/07/11 it was still crowded!! But I decided to brave it.... And my oh my am I a happy camper!! 

The restaurant entrance could be a little less crowded if they removed those high chairs.... Being in a wheelchair it was difficult to get in the front door. Remove the high chairs and me and my wheelchair brethren will be golden. Waited just a couple minutes to be taken to my table. Such a small place for the amount of business they get ! Free wifi internet was available. So I was able to hook up with my iPhone!! Yay!! Was helped immediately by a friendly waitress who got me Coffee.....STAT!! Being filipino I opted for the \"Ricks Adobo Rice Omelet\" .... The waitress said \"Is that it\"? and I asked if it was a small portion... She said NOPE!! Trying to watch my girlish figure I opted for the Omelet alone.... And pardon my french but it was FRICKEN HUGE!! hehehehe!! The rice and Adobo pork was cooked to perfection and the eggs nicely cooked. Yummy !! So scrumptious. 

Will definitely come here again!! I'll even brave the weekend  crowd for this place. Thats saying a lot ! Think I'll be trying the Velvet Pancakes  on my return."}
{"text":"Gotta love babystacks! When I miss Hawaii, and their awesome breakfast. I would come here to just satisfy my soul. With big portions, and great Hawaiian offerings, how could one go wrong here for breakfast? Oh, but I come for the panclocks! I had a morning date with my favorite 8 year old man Vince. Plus I owed him a good birthday breakfast so I had to make it count! The wait wasn't long at all. We were seated at a small table for two, but they were so accomodating to move us to a bigger table when my sister dropped in for breakfast last minute. 

Vince ordered their orange creamsicle pancake (figures since his favorite color is after all orange.) After sampling a few bites, I would say that it tastes a lot like an orange creamsicle. The pancake is also orange. It is a fun choice for kids. the cream cheese and orange syrup was pretty delish and made for a good mix with the pancakes. 

I however, ordered the lemon ricotta. It is served with three crepe like thin pancakes and fresh lemon slices with cream cheese syrup. If you are a sweedish pancake fan or even a fan of tart and sweet...THIS IS THE PANCAKE FOR YOU! Oh..it was amazing. the pancakes were thin and soft, and the tart and sweetness combo made it just the right choice. the portions are big so you will get full fast.

I also took bites of their nutella crepe which is loaded with nutella and are huge! If you love nutella or nutella crepe for that matter. do recommend theirs as well."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast in Las Vegas. I had a build your own skillet with scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms, and spinach. It's served over oven roasted potatoes and your choice of a side (pancakes or toast).I chose sourdough and it came buttered. It was fresh, hot and delicious! I also added a single sweet cream crepe with strawberries and it was so perfect! It was served with fresh strawberries and a fresh strawberry syrup on the side. The sweet cream is a cream cheese filling that isn't too sweet, but complements the strawberries wonderfully. The other choice was bananas. Chrissy was our server and she was friendly, cheerful and a pleasure. Service is A+. My partner had buttermilk pancakes. They were fluffy, obviously homemade and fresh to order. Overall, we throughly enjoyed our breakfast and we will be back before we leave Vegas! 
Disclaimer: I rarely give a five star, so this is in no way meant to discourage anyone  from dining here. I highly recommend this cafe :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Babystacks in Vegas, i come here every weekend even though i live in enterprise area. I always get my crepes, potatoes, & eggs fix. But i highly recommend their locomoco or any of their other specialties"}
{"text":"BabyStacks is an absolute MUST if you want to get away from the craziness of the Strip and have a delicious, comforting breakfast among the locals. It appears to be a family owned establishment, and that showed by the warm, genuine welcome we received upon entering the front door. On a Sunday, BabyStacks was packed, but we were able to snag a table in about ten minutes. 

BabyStacks has a reputation for a robust menu featuring every pancake flavor you can think of, in addition to hearty breakfast classics that come with a unique Filipino touch. I wanted both sweet and savory in my belly before the journey home to San Diego, and, therefore, opted to have the Kalua Pork Benedict and a small order of the Carrot Cake Pancakes with cream cheese icing. 

The Kalua Pork Benedict was amazing. The pork was succulent and flavorful. Loved the potatoes on the side. Unless you're a vegetarian, I challenge anyone to have a bite of this dish and not walk away happy. I enjoyed the Carrot Cake Pancakes, but I regretted not picking a different flavor. The pancakes were very good, but they weren't as moist as I was imagining them to be. On my next visit, I'm going to have the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes. 

My breakfast companion opted for the Adobo Rice Omelette. An imaginative dish that worked on every level. I snagged a bite and would have equally been pleased had I ordered it. 

So, make BabyStacks part of your Vegas itinerary the next time you're in town. It's charm will undoubtedly warm your heart."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews of this spot I was expecting a lot, and they delivered.  Red velvet pancakes were great, the full stack was too much to finish in one sitting even for a big guy like me.  Service was quick and polite.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"So I understand the locals like this place a lot, perhaps it is because of the varieties (Filipino, Hawaiian, American) available to choose from.  The menu is not a 2 pager, it is something to be studied.  Since I'm from out of town, I always want to go where the locals prefer.  We showed up @ about 11:00 am on a weds & the place was already humming.  When we left an hour later, there was a sizable crowd waiting for tables...the weekends must be a mad house here. 
I had the Kalua pig Benedict @ $9.75 and it was delicious.  My friend & I shared a short Red velvet pancake ($8.95 full, $5.75 short).  We loved the food.  Our server was fantastic.  She checked on us a few times & kept our beverages topped off.  I am so bookmarking this joint for future visits."}
{"text":"Went there with the kids this morning again  , we had Nicole as our server , excellent service , food always great , kids enjoy their breakfast , this place is always be our number choice for brunch"}
{"text":"Friendly service and big menu. The bacon pancakes were great. They top up the coffee regularly and have a creative menu. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in town , fresh food and the service is fast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Baby Stacks!  What I really loved about this place, was their perfect portion sizes.  I ordered a combo meal, hashbrowns, eggs and upgraded my pancakes.  Ordered the Rocky Road pancakes.  All were really good.  My friend had the red velvet pancakes, which are really sweet.  I want to try so much more, some other time.

Expect about a 30-45 minute wait for a table.  It's a small place.  Worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of unique pancakes. Fast courteous service. Try the orange creamsicle pancakes"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and their red velvet pancakes.  A lot.

We called one morning and asked if there was a wait to gauge if we should attempt this infamous place.  We were told there's no wait, come on down!  So we jumped in the car and got there literally 5 minutes later and there was *surprise* a 25 - 30 minute wait.  There were only 2 parties in front of us, so I figured it would probably be less of a wait.  Well, we ended up waiting 40 minutes.  That put a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth right at the beginning of this experience, going from no wait to a 40 minute wait.  But that's the nature of the restaurant biz, and I wanted those red velvet pancakes!

We ordered.  I ended up getting an omelet and upgraded my bread side to the RVP, my husband got the fried rice adobo, and my mom got the Eggs Benedict.  When the food came out...I was surprised by how crappy it looked.  Sorry to be blunt, but that's how it looked: crappy.  I expected more after hearing so much buzz.  My omelet, which was supposed to have swiss cheese in it, had 2 slices of processed-store-bought-fake-sandwich-slice white stuff barely melted on top.  My potatoes were obviously from a frozen bag and blandly seasoned at that.  My husband didn't mind his fried rice, but said it was very dry.  My mom's eggs benedict was just ok, and it also came with the frozen potatoes.  I couldn't believe the lack of quality.

The RVP were the only saving grace for the place.  They truly are delicious and I'm glad I got to experience them.  However, I definitely would not be able to eat a whole order of them as they are extremely sweet.

So in short: the wait is long, the food is from frozen and processed crap, and the pancakes are delicious.  Would I make a trip back and wait that long just for the pancakes, though? No."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! Best pancakes ever! Staff is friendly, service is quick, and the food is delicious. I have been a few times and my favorite is the banana fosters pancakes.  Very sweet and yummy. I would recommend baby stacks to anyone who is in the mood for some great breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Ate here this morning. Great food. Our server was great. The restaurant is a little small but cute. They do have a sigh that states first come first serve as far as seating there customers and they called someone before us. So that's why I gave only 4 stars. Yummy place."}
{"text":"We have been here several times now and I've like everything I've ordered. The food always seems fresh! Our kids usually clean their plates. You can order the senior special for kids, and it's just enough food for our 5 yr old. I usually get the southwest skillet and it is delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This has become a tradition for us. I love the option that you can have the breakfast as an omelet or skillet.  I feel like the portions could be bigger but with the baby stak's I can't complain really. The coffee is really good too, most restaurants like this their coffee isn't strong at all."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas we wanted to desperately  escape the overpriced low-quality  food from the hotels on the strip. Thank you Yelpers for your help  finding this jewel!
We arrived 30 min before closing and we were welcomed as if they just opened their doors. 
Our server Jacob made some suggestions since this was our first time here and  we were not familiar with the menu. I had the special: short ribs, two eggs, garlic rice and for the perfect ending German cake pancakes.
Hubby ordered the pork egg Benedict.
Oh boy...what a breakfast!!
Food came out super quick. Everything was delicious, cooked to perfection, the ribs were unbelievable.  Tender, juicy...could have been a rib eye. That good!! Thanks again to Jacob for this suggestion and for keeping my cup of coffee full at all times.  He was very attentive.
The pancakes...ufff....to die for. I can't describe it...just have them."}
{"text":"Ironically enough after eating at their location on Buffalo just yesterday, a friend asked me out to breakfast today at Babystacks at the Stephanie location. Just as much as I regretted eating there yesterday at the Buffalo location, I regretted coming to this one even more ((if that's even possible)). Upon walking in, the decor in the restaurant is very tacky. It looks like someone went into the cheesy home section at multiple Walmart and picked out sets of decorations (signs with tacky quotes like \"peace, love happiness\" and a clock with rainbow mustaches on it on the opposing wall... just to paint the picture..), none of which matching each other. The service was some of the worst I've ever had. The server with a giant red hairspray Afro came to our table maybe once the entire time. I specially asked for syrup and butter for my pancakes when I ordered them because I learned my lesson from yesterday In the fact that they don't bring you anything you need to dine. When my order came out, surprise! No butter and no syrup FOR MY PANCAKES. They're pancakes!! How can you forget that? Our server was no where to be found, shock! So after waiting 5+ minutes I had to go up to the bar area and ask someone to bring some out and by that time my pancakes were so cold that the butter wouldn't spread, *sigh*. The awful service was then followed by awful food! In my first review of the buffalo location, the tasty pancakes saved them from being a total waste of time but this time, my red velvet pancakes tasted super dry and the chocolate powder they used seemed like they got to the bottom of the barrel and sprinkled the left over crumbs on my pancakes. The sausage tasted awful, like someone literally made me microwaveable sausage. Overall the terrible flow of the restaurant, awful waiter, and terrible food was enough to make sure I NEVER come back regardless of what location it is. Safe yourself the time and go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Today I decided to try out Babystacks after many people hurdled their compliments about this restaurant my way. Unfortunately , I would have to disagree. Although the food was good, the service was lack luster. I had to ask the server (who was barely ever seen) for things such as butter, syrup, and more water. That's one of my biggest pet peeves, when a server drops off pancakes and doesn't leave any butter or syrup! It's a pancake!! Butter and syrup is crucial. Although my red velvet pancakes were tasty, the service was enough to ensure that I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this location since we moved to Las Vegas in 2013 . The wait can make you a little impatient but trust me , the food is worth it ! Our wait is usually no more than 20-30 minutes depending on the time of day . Their menu has expanded over the years with such great choices ! 
My personal favorite is the Banana Foster Pancakes with seasoned potatoes on the side . I was completely opposed to any toppings on buttermilk pancakes before (I'm plain jane when it comes to seasonings and toppings) but THIS will change anyone's mind ! The pancakes are cooked to perfection and the caramel and banana toppings are amaze . I always have leftovers to take home for later. The service is always outstanding , especially the server with the cool hair !"}
{"text":"First time... I hear people talk about it all the time.. thought I take the boyfriend there for his pre bday breakfast. All the hype.. it wasn't as good as every one hyped it to be.. food was ok.. came out quick for as busy as they were..  service was good.. they need a better system when it comes to paying... we were in the line to pay longer than we waited for our food... 
Overall.. we could have gone to IHOP for the same things we've ordered and paid less than what we paid here. I personally wouldn't come back, but at least I can say I had it and tried it..."}
{"text":"Late Saturday breakfast. Although there were a number of people standing outside the wait for 3 of us was 25-30 minutes.  Ended up taking the counter which was fine. I had the German Chocolate pancakes. Wow!!!! Daughter had the Red Velvet pancakes which she said were great.  Her finance had the strawberry crepe which looked really good. Shared the biscuits and gravy with delicious seasoned potatoes. Great service, nice atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back. Huge menu with lots of choices."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place to go for a nice family breakfast. We found this place after butting heads with the idiots at the IHOP down the road.
The wife had the bacon pancakes and she said they were very good. I had one of the skillets and it was amazing. The staff here was very friendly and they all seemed to work together as a team to help out the customers. 
Support local business and give this place a try."}
{"text":"my dish was on point. eggs benedict but the reason for three stars is cause the coffee was way to strong for breakfast joint coffee and my friend got biscuits and gravy and they were not very good and either was the sausage links on the side"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! So might as well make it the best too. 
I came here a few days ago with a friend and the place was packed, waited about 30 minutes to get seated, but it was worth the wait. Once we we got seated we got immidiate service, our coffee was brought to us faster than we could order it. 

I looked at the menu for a good minute since everything looked delicious, i am a simple girl and dont like having to choose between so many awesone choices. Why cant i just choose them all?! 
Anywho, i ordered the red velvet pancakes(short stack) and 3 beautifully sized, fluffy red pancakes arrived in less than 10 minutes(now i remind you that i waited an extra 40 minutes to eat, so i was starving) 
and my friend ordered cookie butter french toast.

About my pancakes: WHAT THE H*** WERE THESE THINGS MADE OUT OF? CRACK? I didnt eat the pancakes, i inhaled them. They were so good! I wanted more when i was done(even though i was about to explode) and still to this day i am craving them. 

French toast: i tried some of my friends and it was delicious as well. If i wasnt so stuffed from my pancakes i probably would of inhaled them too while my friend was in the bathroom. 

I definetly recommend this place. The food wasnt the only thing that was outstanding, the service was as well."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. We went back twice over a 4 day period for breakfast. Our team went back a third time as well. It's not really anything special, but the food is special. 

Babystacks offers a lot of great different kinds of pancakes, which are amazing. In addition, their savory items are pretty top notch as well. I tried the Cinnabun pancakes (amazing) and the Red Velvet pancakes (very good). Also, I had the Portuguese sausage with white rice and eggs.

I have a feeling everything on the menu is good, so give it a try."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  This is the best breakfast place in Centennial Hills.  I had the banana foster pancakes and they were incredibly delicious.   The food is amazing and the service is outstanding .   There was a little wait of about 15-20 minutes but it was well worth the wait.  I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch with cool Hawaiian vibes and unique pancake flavors. Got the Cowboy skillet and subbed the ham for turkey sausage and the TLC pancakes (toffee and caramel pancakes), the weekend special. The skillet was a big portion, and tasted like you would expect but nothing very special - delicious cheesy potatoes and egg. Can't really go wrong with that. The real star of the menu are their pancakes. They're soft, fluffy, and come decked out with a bunch of toppings. I also had some of my friends tiramisu pancakes, another weekend special, that had coffee batter and mascarpone whipped cream, and the red velvet pancakes, which would be a good choice if you like really rich and sweet breakfasts. Overall, a very good value for your money!"}
{"text":"Me and my family come here often! Their pancakes are so good. I got the banana foster recently..LOVED IT!! I usually get the red velvet pancakes but decided to try something diff. The portugues sausage with rice and eggs are my go-to!! Last time i went they gave a small portion..literally 6 small pieces of sausage. I was pissed. But overall, food is good and service is great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant appears to be a mixed bag for me.  In some things, it is amazing, and in others, not so great.

First as to ambience and first impressions:  The restaurant is small (maximum capacity 50) in an uninspiring but clean strip mall.  upon entering the restaurant, it is clean, with warm homelike decorations and a warm inviting somewhat neutral light brown paint color that you might see in model home.  The decorations are ones that you might get in a bed bath and beyond or pier 1 imports which give the ambience of a homelike restaurant environment.  Some of the tables are high stool oriented that use comfortable leather stools as the chairs.  Other tables are against the wall using hardwood bench seating as chairs.

Initially the hostess was welcoming.  But within moments the hostess gave a cold uncaring impression.  She stated that the table would be ready in a few minutes and then proceeded to do cashier work, which was fine.  However, three new customers came in and for no less than 5 minutes, she never spoke with the new customers.  Not even the quick look up and \"I'll be with you in a minute.\"  She would even walk past myself and other customers and not establish eye contact.  Even when she did establish eye contact, there was no smile.  Not something that will destroy an experience, but also not something that would help the overall feel of the restaurant.

Unfortunately, after being seated no menu was provided and it took the waitress a few pregnant pause minutes to get the menu to me.  I had the feeling that she was the only waitress in the restaurant -- which I later found out was not the case.  

However, when she did provide the menu, her attitude and service were warm and friendly with many smilies.  She certainly helped to overcome the feelings that the hostess had created.  

Food:  In this regard too, the restaurant did some things amazingly well, and others oh so mediocre.  For the good, they are known for their red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and they are very good.  If you don't like sweet, don't try them.  They are inviting and indulgent.  They come with a creme cheese syrup.  The two combined make for a taste of red velvet cake combined with a sweetness of a cinnabon roll with syrup.  Decadent.  The waitress invited me to have them as a side to my omelette which was just perfect -- rather than a full stack of pancakes.

In addition, I had the mexican omelet which included carnets, jalapeños, cilantro, onions, cheese.  The combination of the omelet and the pancake made for a wonderful confluence of tastes from spicy to sweet and then back.

With such a wonderful combination, the frozen potatoes that came with the omelet was such a violent speed bump on my wonderful country road journey for breakfast.  The potatoes were clearly dull, uninviting in taste and such a contradiction with the other dishes that you are now questioning why you came to the restaurant in the first place.  It is a shame that they couldn't just pan fry some homemade potatoes to complement an otherwise wonderful meal.  I felt like was experiencing a painting by an artist and as I moved from left to right I realize that the oil painting of the mona lisa is done in exquisite detail, but the background is quickly drawn in crayons because there is a deadline to put out volumes of art.

Overall, I would still try to go to the place for an experience.  I would probably go again to see if the experience was the same, but I worry that the generic school cafeteria style could infect other dishes."}
{"text":"So annoyed. Called today at 11:48 to order take out and \"Julie\" said they can't take to go orders because they are too busy. I don't understand why they can't take an order and if their kitchen is open. I didn't even mind waiting. Perhaps they need to change their info and state they don't do take out orders."}
{"text":"Awesome red velvet pancakes.  Worth a 20 minute drive.  Coffee is ok."}
{"text":"Found this place via Groupon and wanted to try it out based on the stellar reviews. My bf and I have enjoyed everything we've ordered from here during our two visits. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. The food has a delicious Hawaiian flare. Laid back atmosphere- great service- yummy food- I'm sold! Ps: give the lemon ricotta stack a try- FaNtAsTiC!"}
{"text":"Love me some Babystacks! You might have guessed what their specialty is by now. You got it.. It's their cakes'. Let me tell ya---they're slap your momma good! There are more than a dozen of cakes' to pick from. Options include: Red Velvet, Rocky Road, Chocolate Chip, Bacon (yup, you heard that right), and lemon ricotta (Lemon Ricotta is my absolute favorite). If cakes' aren't your thing, they offer other items like skillets (layers of potatoes, cheese, eggs and other toppings) , specialty items that feature SPAM, Garlic Rice, Portuguese Sausage, or Kalua Pig Benedict (another personal favorite).  Service at this location has always been great. The atmosphere is nothing fancy. However, their fresh cakes' and local ambience hits the mark in my book.

Warning:  Even though this location is larger than the one in Summerlin, expect to wait on the weekends (even if you arrive at a reasonable time for breakfast). The wait will be worth it and I'm betting you'll return again to try another one of their specialties."}
{"text":"THANK YOU for finally opening a Henderson location! The food was great as always and the service was good also, it was wonderful to avoid driving 30 minutes to eat my favorite breakfast joint in town."}
{"text":"...it's alright to good.  It really depends on what you order and the day. The idea of the dishes are often better than the actual execution.  If they used the adobo chicken with their chicken skillet or build your own omelette then they'd have something."}
{"text":"Pancakes are everything. Personally my favorite are the cookies & creme. Also there banana creme pie pancakes are good. Been here a few times staff is always friendly wether your dining in or take out. Very clean. The chili loco moco is worth a try. Add garlic rice. Also there ricks adobo omelette is okay just salty meat but that's how it is supposed to taste so whatever floats your boat. Def worth a try."}
{"text":"Yummy food! The waitress not so friendly like she was in a hurry to take our order. Other than that the food is delicious"}
{"text":"I love their Rick's Adobo Fried Rice and their Red Velvet Pancakes!  They have excellent customer service and everyone is very welcoming."}
{"text":"I love Yelp!  We were in Las Vegas just for a night staying at the JW Marriott.  I am a big breakfast person and decided to use Yelp to find a cool breakfast place to eat.  I am so glad I found this place!

We had a great meal.  Imagine our surprise when we saw Loco Moco on the menu!  We travel to Hawaii each year and my husband is a huge fan of Loco Moco!  Too bad they were out!  We picked other items off the menu and they were great.  I had one of the omlets and my husband had something with pancakes!  Sorry it has been a month so I don't remember exactly!  But it was GOOD!

What also stood out was the great service we received.  Our waiter was very nice and that really stood out in our minds.  A real genuine niceness...not something forced.

Not sure when we will be back through Las Vegas but when we are in the area we will be back!"}
{"text":"We came to babystacks in the early afternoon. We were seated immediately. We both got coffee that was fresh and hot. The cups were kept full throughout the meal. Our food was fantastic. We had pb and banana pancakes as well as the mocha chip pancakes. All of it was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love babystacks but this location really needs to fix the wobbly tables. Other than that I love my Banana Foster pancakes Just fix the tables don't want to worry about my coffee or water spilling all over my food. Thanks"}
{"text":"We came to Babystacks while waiting for a store at the mall to open. What a surprise. Other reviews said to be patient as the wait can be long. It was 8:30 on a Friday morning. The two of us were seated right away. Yes, they had UFC on the one tv but I love UFC. 
We had the Kalua Pug Benedict and the Mexican Skillet. The most difficult part of our experience was deciding what to order. The menu is huge!  We decided, \"What the heck!  We'll just have to come back to try more.!\""}
{"text":"brunch fanatic? you HAVE to try babycakes out, trust me, your stomach will THANK you!

what i ate:
- daily special: breakfast burrito: potatoes, bacon (your choice of breakfast protein), eggs, cheese. everything inside was cooked to PERFECTION. im not kidding you! the potatoes were crispy edged fluffy potato pillows. the eggs werent overly mushy or overly hard. the cheese was melted. even the freaking tortilla was soft and hot and oh so yummy. i cant believe im raving so much about a breakfast burrito. my only gripe was that my korean tongue wanted more of a KICK to the burrito so i added globs of cholulu hot sauce. i wish it had come with some pico de gallo or something for some extra heat. 
- daily special: cinnamon bun pancakes: this was cinnamon toast crunch cereal in PANCAKE FORM. the texture, the flavors, the buttermilk was all there. delicious
- short stack of the FAMOUS red velvet pancakes: hands down the BEST red velvet pancakes ive had. the pancakes were cooked perfectly - the edges were cripsy, and they were cooked all the way. they were tender, but not mushy. just enough bite without being overcooked. the cream cheese syrup? genius! huge dollop of whipped cream with chocolate shavings on top? this was PERFECTION
- pig omelet w/hashbrowns: we had to get it cause of the name. the pig omelet? filled with various porky products - ham and bacon. we added spinach because we thought a lil green wouldnt hurt, espcially with our sugar overload. also cooked perfectly. the eggs werent tough, but tender and the cheese was perfectly melted. the hashbrowns were thin and crispy and cooked! 
- coffee: MUST get the coffee! its a great cup of joe to help wash down the rest of your meal

pros:
- FOOD. i cant speak for their lunch menu, but from what ive eaten from the brunch/breakfast menu, i have to say that everything was cooked so well. nothing was over or under cooked. everything was seasoned well. i was happy to see some hawaiian/flip dishes on the menu too! definitely want to try those next time
- service: staff were all friendly and courteous. service with a smile

cons:
- the WAIT. my friend and i waited about an hour for a table for two at 11am on a sunday. the place is SMALL and tucked in some random corner of a very dead plaza. but to be honest the wait was WORTH it! 
- off the strip. this is definitely a locals joint! kind of far to eat if youre staying on the strip

would i come again? YES YES YES!"}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place a low rating must not ENJOY GOOD FOOD!!!  It (my experience) started at the door with the friendliest hostess. Warm smile, energy, and even loaned me a pen!  Sat down and looked at a crazy cool selection of items. Different skillets, eggs Benedict options and staple egg dishes. Flipped the menu and the fun jumped to the \"sweet\" section. Pancakes, crepes, and French toast dishes.  Told my waitress that I was STRONGLY recommended by the hotel concierge to eat there. As I will do often I asked her what her favorite thing to eat was and she led me to the KALUA PIG BENEDICT (Yes...I was yelling it just then) and it was amazing. Shredded pork was awesome. Hollandaise sauce was velvety smooth with a perfect balance of acid and cream.  I also ordered a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes...don't judge me I walked 7 miles earlier.  Here's the deal...she could have given me the full short stack and charged me the 5.95 for the short stack but instead informed me of the option to go with pancakes over potatoes for only 1.50 instead!  That's service. These pancakes were amazing. Sweet, buttery, and the sweet cream icing...only used a bit but it was delicious!  Las Vegas...you gotta check out BABYSTACKS Breakfast and Lunch Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. It's everything I want in a place. Hawaiian food, Breakfast food, delicious. When I first walked in I was surprised by how busy it was. On a Thursday at 11:30, there was still a wait. No big deal, the wait was quick and the food was well worth the wait. Spam and Eggs, seasoned potatoes and Banana cream pancakes. It was truly a little piece of heaven. I teared up a little, thinking about how much I wish my dad could try the food, and how happy he would have been there. The waitress was nice enough to ask me if there was anything wrong and anything she can do to make it better, she was so so sweet about it. Its truly one of my favorite places to eat and a big selling point in me moving to Vegas"}
{"text":"I was introduced to BabyStacks through a co-worker about a year ago and I have never had a bad meal here.  Just yesterday (Nov. 4, 2014) I dined here with my daughter and we were seated right away.  Place was almost filled, but that is to be expected for a small dining area.  This day we had Monica as our server, and she had waited on me before on previous visits as well.  She is the constant professional, sweet, attentive, and clearly knowledgeable of her duties.

On this visit I ordered the bacon and egg breakfast with seasoned potatoes, their seasonal pumpkin pancakes with that delicious sauce, and an order of wheat toast.  My daughter enjoyed their bacon pancakes.  Everything came out within 10-12 min of ordering and was perfectly prepared.  I forgot to ask Monica to make my bacon crispy, but it was still good.  I love their bacon!  Daughter also enjoyed her cakes too...while stealing a few of my potatoes.  

I look forward to my next visit where I know the food and service will be just as enjoyable.  Keep up the great quality BabyStacks team!!"}
{"text":"It took a while, but I finally made my return visit to BabyStacks for another awesome breakfast.  This time I came with my mom since she wanted to try a different place that wasn't on the Strip.  

As much as I loved their Adobo and Rice Omelette last time I was there, I wanted to try something different this time, however I wasn't in the mood for their pancakes since I wanted something more savory.  The Hawaiian Benedict definitely caught my eye on the menu so I ordered that while my mom decided on their Kalbi Beef & Eggs.

Hawaiian Benedict -- http://bit.ly/2vLHkJQ
Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, Spam, Eggs, Brown Gravy, Furikake
This was like a loco moco but with Spam on top of Hawaiian sweet rolls and it was really good!!  I loved how everything was smothered in gravy and how the runny egg yolks oozed over everything as well.  Made for a very comforting meal.  I'd definitely order this again.  

Kalbi Beef & Eggs -- http://bit.ly/2vLshQl
This was what my mom ordered and she enjoyed it as well.  She gave me one of her kalbi short ribs to try and I thought it was marinated very well and not overcooked.  Great portion size though.

BabyStacks once again delivered as a great breakfast spot.  I'm glad I took my mom here and showed her that there are other great places to eat breakfast off the Strip.  Maybe next time I visit Vegas, I'll stop by again and try their famous pancakes."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before? It's amazing.

Every few weeks I'll treat myself to a very rich breakfast and this is one of my favorite places to visit. The place is alwaya packed so you might wait a few minutes before being seated but don't worry the wait usually isn't more than a few minutes.

The cuisine revolves primarily around pancakes but there are other options. Some even have a Hawaiian/Filipino take on them like the Hawaiian eggs Benedict they have on the menu. Easily some of my favorite eggs benedicts in Vegas. 

Pancakes here are perfect and not dry like other places. You can get them standard or upgrade them to any of their different options. Most people I know like them upgraded with the red velvet batter but I prefer them with strawberry topping on top.

Very casual atmosphere and the casual setting is very welcoming. Every server I've had is super attentive too. Definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I wasn't very hungry so I just got a short stack of there bacon pancakes. They were pretty good and although I give the restaurant 4 stars i would I've the pancakes a 3. All the bacon was condensed in the middle. They were very tasty though."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday morning to get breakfast and I think we beat the rush when we arrived. They initially told us 15-20 minutes for a table but once I sat down on the bench across the registers, they called us for a table. Cool!

It took a little while for someone to get our drink and food orders but they were super nice and didn't rush us. I got a strawberry baby stack with my Spam scramble with garlic fried rice. I demolished my strawberry pancakes and I only ate half of my Spam scramble. My cousin got the adobo omelette and he prefers the one at Baby Stacks over Aloha Kitchen. At Baby Stacks, they use fluffier egg whereas at Aloha Kitchen, they egg looks skimpy.

Food was good. Parking was plenty. Oh, and they don't split checks here! And you pay at the register!"}
{"text":"I don't usually indulge in pancakes, but decided to try the cookie butter French toast. OMG!! So good. The little. It of crunch and taste of cookie and still with delicious fluffy French toast: perfect. And they are always so friendly here!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly. The service was good and the coffee was hot. I liken this to a Shari's or Denny's- I think the rating is a bit inflated. We had the following:
Red velvet pancakes, Orange Pancakes, Banana Pancakes, Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and chicken fried steak. My husband was not overly pleased with the chicken fried steak and more syrup was in order on all accounts. Those are my lack of five factors."}
{"text":"Wowsers. Walking in the door I was struck by a hand-written sign: White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes... need I see more? No need to even give me a menu... but then they did -- and perfect got even better. 

Red Velvet Pancakes with Chocolate Chips, Whipped Cream, and Cream Cheese Syrup...  Done. Ordered. Devoured. . . Delicious. 

For those who don't want to die of sugar overload, they also have normal pancakes, an assortment of yummy breakfast foods (many with a Hawaiian flare), and sandwiches/burgers for lunch. The Eggs Benedict were very good (add a slice of avocado to make them awesome). 

I'll be going back again soon... that's a promise."}
{"text":"I have been at Babystacks a few weeks ago and just loved it sooo much! This is my type of breakfast. They had a great choice of pancakes and other deliciuosness. I chose German chocolate pancakes, because I love rich chocolate flavour. 
My fiancé and me loved their food and were happy with a nice service. I highly reccommend that place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Ordered the traditional eggs bendy (9.75) and red velvet pancakes (5.75)This cafe has the aloha spirit running deep in its veins, from the gregarious smiles of the staff to the Hawaiian infused menu items. 
  I really enjoyed my food. Riding solo at the counter I stretched my stomach by adding the pancakes after my meal. Fair enough, these flapjacks are really dessert anyways. I give full marks for my eggs benny.  Good hollandaise sauce over perfectly cooked eggs. A combo that always makes my stomach very happy. The sweet pancakes were also very delicious, coming with a cream cheese syrup and chocolate flakes. Very fluffy! Service was provided by Kaylah, and she rocked it! I was checked on numerous times and she couldn't be more friendly! At this price point I'm giving babystacks 5 stars for food and service. I believe they have 3 locations to serve u, my review applies to this location only. Mahalo babystacks!"}
{"text":"Took a day trip to Vegas & a friend recommend BabyStacks,  I guess a lot of locals come here. The food was delicious, I could taste all the flavors of the food as it was fresh."}
{"text":"Got there Saturday morning around 9am. Waited five minutes to be seated. Ordered the Portuguese sausage with banana cream pie upgrade on the pancakes for $1.50 more. Coffee was okay (on the bitter side) and they don't have Splenda. My wife got the macadamia pancake with a side of bacon. We thought the food was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. The pancakes tasted like they were from a mix. I liked my banana cream pie pancake very much. Sweet with lots of bananas and other sweetness. The macadamia on the other hand was just pancakes with white chocolate chip. Macadamia nuts were missing on her plate. 

The staff is friendly and the drinks server was attentive.

When we left, the wait became thirty minutes. I suggest you arrive early if you want to avoid the rush. Seems like a local joint. Lots of young families, Filipinos, and regulars..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I haven't had anything spectacular but the food is pretty good. Having said that, I haven't been too adventurous. They have everything: omelettes, spam scramble, kalua pig benedict, red velvet pancakes, etc. You name it, they got it. And it does look good, but I personally like a light breakfast so I usually get eggs. Their skillets are my go-to order. 

Special shout out for the lemon ricotta pancakes - OMG. They were delicious. I unfortunately I didn't order this so I only got one bite. My sister would only let me have one bite of hers lol. It was really good. I thought it would be heavy but it wasn't at all. It was fluffy & light. The cream cheese syrup was dreamy."}
{"text":"Food: Great. 
Location: Good.
Wait time: Understandable (for a Sunday Morning)
Service: Seen better at Cici's (the host did not acknowledge me for 2 solid minutes as I stood directly in front of him AT THE PODIUM [I am 6' tall, I am not hard to miss])
Prices: $ (though should be in the $$ range but the portions are generous)"}
{"text":"they sat people that came after our party, average food nothing extra special compared to all the hawaiian filipino restaurants out here and ive been to most of em, and they served my wifes salad after i finished my heavy rice plate. worth a second visit? certainly not, another hype resto that i wont visit again."}
{"text":"We went to breakfast at around 8:45 am. As we pulled into the parking lot, I was unsure of what to expect. It looks old and vacant with a sign taped to the door. The sign was simply to inform customers that they will not split checks.

So if you want to split the check, get over it. They do one check per table. Also they only seat you if your entire party has arrived. This didn't apply to us since we were paying and arriving together.

We were seated immediately by a very kind waitress. The menu has a good variety and their pancakes are so good. A short stack (3 pancakes) can easily fill you up for less than $5. We decided on the Bananas Foster and Red Velvet with sides of sausage and hash browns. The food was served very quickly. It was fantastic and surprising.

I highly recommend their pancakes and hash browns. They are the best I've tried in the Vegas area.

We ate at a relaxing pace and there was attentive service. When we asked for our check, it was ready immediately and we paid at the cashier. They cleaned our table before we were out the door and had it ready to seat new customers. I think we were out of there by 9:20.

If you are looking for a quick, delicious meal at a great price with excellent service, then this is the place! Thank you BabyStacks!"}
{"text":"I am new to Las Vegas and my friend who has been here for a few months brought me here as a \"Welcome to Vegas!\" Brunch. It was about a 30 min wait, you could tell this place was a poppin place for Saturday morning brunch. When I looked at the menu I was so surprised to see they had island food! I felt almost like I was at home. I was going to order the spam and eggs, but I decided to go with the adobo omelet. It was amazing... I also had a short stack of the whites chocolate macadamia nut pancakes. Omg... I will be coming back and I will introduce more people to this place. 5 stars, hands down."}
{"text":"Amazing every time.  Seriously, everything on the menu is outstanding, service is super friendly, I love Babystacks!!!"}
{"text":"Why should I go..... Because you want great breakfast food and variety 

Spam scramble:  Basically a spam omelet.  With garlic rice. So good.  Especially if you haven't eaten it in a long time. 

Nutella pancakes:  a dessert pancake that never fails to satisfy 

Price:  About 8-10.... Fair I guess.  I always want cheaper but eh what can you do"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes topped with fresh whipped cream and chocolate crumbles, served with cream cheese syrup are amazing. We also loved the carrot cake pancakes, yummy. My all-time favorite though is the Kailua pig benedict spectacular. 

Delicious food but they need a larger space, they are always packed"}
{"text":"Recommend. My daughter and I visited on a Thursday morning and were sat immediately. The restaurant was hallway full, and the servers were quietly and efficiently buzzing around. This was my second time eating at this establishment, and was quickly put at ease remembering my first experience coupled with the early sight of thoroughness by the employees. Orders were taken briskly, with no compromise on service. Customer service is absolutely excellent, taste equally pleasing. Portions left a little to be desired, but considering the price and me leaving feeling comfortable, overall my expectations were met. Filipino and Hawaiian cuisine that's very pleasurable."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Babystacks is a great, consistent breakfast choice for anyone living in the Spring Valley area. I've been going here since they opened and I've tried most of the things on the menu (except the lunch stuff). They have tons of creative pancake flavors, many of which can be an upgraded side for other breakfast entrees. I recommend the red velvet, lemon ricotta, and the strawberry pancakes. The red velvet pancakes come with a cream cheese syrup and a whipped cream on top. The strawberry pancakes have a strawberry syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream on top. Then the lemon ricotta is a thin, crepe-like pancake with lemons and powdered sugar.

I highly recommend getting a skillet or the adobo fried rice, then upgrading the side to your favorite babystack for an additional fee. It's worth it to have both if you're hungry then just take home any leftovers. The adobo fried rice is something I've never had at another restaurant. The fried rice is wrapped in a big omelette, probably like 3-4 eggs if I had to guess. The rice itself is flavorful and I love that you can taste a bit of vinegar in it with the meat.

The staff here is always friendly and attentive. They'll refill your water or coffee before you even need to flag them down. The prices are great, with most things hitting just under $10. When you're ready to go, they'll hand you the check and you go up to the front register to pay when you're done. They have a big parking lot in this plaza so there's more than enough space. Just try to avoid the weekend brunch crowd, when the wait can sometimes be 30+ mins. Other times, you'll be seated almost immediately. There's bathrooms in the back, always clean. And they have a very homey interior with TV's usually playing news or sports."}
{"text":"Came in to show my sister what I thought was going to be an amazing breakfast. She's visiting me from Hawaii so figured she would like it here. First she ordered scrambled eggs (shelled eggs) we for egg mix from a carton. So then we decided to ask for over hard since they wouldn't give us fresh eggs. Well guess they don't like it when they are proven wrong. So they burnt our eggs. Our potatoes were so hard that my kids couldn't and wouldn't eat them. Ive been in the industry for many years. The server decided to question me and tell me that I was wrong and they were using shelled eggs. Right!! Especially with that bright yellow color on the eggs."}
{"text":"My last visit did it for me. I found a lovely long strand of hair in my omelet and the waitress spilled my water all over the floor and on my foot (of course I had to be wearing flip flops and but thankfully it was just water) and didn't even apologize or replace it. And when the other worker came to mop the mess up, he wiped his hands on my napkin WTF!? Big freaking turn off that day. I don't think I'll be coming back in for a while. You have tested my patience long enough BabyStacks. 

I still liked my red velvet pancakes though."}
{"text":"My wife and I get out to Las Vegas one to two times per year.  Just like most people, we usually stay on the strip.  We get a shuttle from and back to the airport.  We NEVER rent a car.  Cabs can be expensive so we normally spend 95% of our time on the strip.  Now that we have family in Sin City, we are starting to venture out a little bit more, and it's the one of the best Vegas decisions we have ever made.

We were talking with our family about where to go for Sunday Brunch.  We found buffets ranging from $17.95 to $90 per person on the strip.  Then I hopped on the internet and found BabyStacks Cafe.  They have 4 locations in town. We liked the description and headed to the one off of Flamingo blvd on Buffalo Drive.

This restaurant is owned by a woman who dared to ask herself one crazy question:  What would happen if you take cupcake flavors and turn them into pancakes?  The answer, pure AWESOMENESS! We were a party of 4 and waited for about 30 minutes to get our table.  From what I read, this is pretty normal for the restaurant.  The capacity is a little over 50+ people, and the demand is high, so be prepared for a little wait.

Once in the restaurant, we found it to be clean and the service was spot on.  We ordered quickly.  Here is what we decided on:

Red velvet pancakes
German chocolate pancakes
Lemon Ricotta crepe like pancakes
Orange Creamsicle pancakes
Bacon pancakes
Biscuits and Gravy with sunny side up eggs and hashbrowns
Mexican Omelette
Egg White Omelette

The menu is full of great sounding cupcake flavored pancakes, as well as traditional favorites.  They even have Hawaiian specialties with pulled pork and spam. If the other dishes are anything close to what we ordered, you can't go wrong.  Every single dish was delicious.  We all shared what we ordered and all any of us could say was, \"WOW!\"  Personally, I thought the red velvet pancakes were the best, but it was so close to call that there really was no clear winner.

I have never raved about breakfast before.  But I just had to write about this place. BabyStacks Cafe is by far the best breakfast I have ever had. Here is the kicker...the total cost for all 4 of us was $70!  We all ate until we were stuffed and every bite was wonderful.  I guarantee that you can't find anything like this on the strip.  I would suggest that if you are on the strip and you don't have a car, Uber, Lyft, or cab-ride it to this restaurant.  You will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pancakes in Vegas. Every time I visit I always go to babystacks. My favs are the red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut, and lemon ricotta. I've also tried the loco moco which also good. I'm glad this place is nowhere near the strip otherwise the wait would be rediculous."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The first time was great. We did have to wait a while for a table. After our first visit I can say the service is not the greatest. You do wait a while for your order to be taken and then sometimes the food is not consistent. The good is still pretty good though just van be very good or just ok."}
{"text":"Service was really great but the quality of food was disappointing:( for most part seemed like food was sitting under heat lamp or made hours ahead. I'd be willing to give it another try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Easy parking in the big lot, fast seating, & super friendly service started this experience off with all my fave things. 

And then the FOOD happened, & it was all over:

Steak & Eggs - I chose their oniony, garlicky garlic fried rice instead of potatoes - SO GOOD with my poached & runny eggs.  The steak was perfectly rare, & my side of hollandaise made me happy.  AND - I upgraded the plain pancakes that came with to:

Red Velvet pancakes - not the best textured pancake bc it was a little on the dry or overdone side, but the chocolate shavings & fresh whipped cream & cream cheese-y syrup that came with it made each bite yummy!  The small stacks are two small pancakes, which are the perfect size to try them yet not stuff yourself silly.

Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs - I had a bite of this & it was damn good!  The crispy battered steak & the gravy were really good.  Hash browns were kindof basic, but the upgrade to these were SO good:

Banana Cream Pie pancakes - another short stack of two perfectly textured, light & fluffy little pancakes, topped with vanilla pudding, sliced fresh bananas, & fresh whipped cream.  These were THE BEST!! 

Their selection of unique kalua pork menu items (grilled cheese & benedict) as well as fried rice rolled into an omelette make me wonder why these guys don't come to LA!!

This is one of the best breakfast places I've been to.  Definitely a must if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"I like babystacks for who they are but I think they can improve on the quality of food that they dish out. I ordered the corned beef, hash browns and and eggs. It came out warm kinda like it's been sitting in the open for a while. I wasn't too happy about that. Coras corned beef hash wasn't really special either it tasted and looked like it came out of a can, no flavor what so ever, their potatoes were not seasoned or up to temperature as well basically got a warm-cold breakfast. A breakfast platter from McDonald's comes out hotter than that. so I probably wouldn't order it again. Their specialty is pancakes and their red velvet never disappoints.  I didn't expect much from their other breakfast items."}
{"text":"We came here based on the amount of reviews and the positive reviews! And we were completely satisfied! It's very well priced and the amount of food isn't incredibly overwhelming but you get completely full and don't need a nap after. We had Efrain as our server and he was very attentive very knowledgeable about the menu and had multiple alternatives for us! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great experience, food,service....all what you want  for breakfast.. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I know there's a ton of rave reviews of this place, which is why we had to try it. I was a bit disappointed in the highly-revered Red Velvet Pancakes. They were good, yes. Without the cream cheese \"syrup\" and whipped cream, it would have been nothing special at all.

We also tried the Adobo Fried Rice, which comes in am omelete. It was a nice, large portion, but I thought there could have been less eggs, and more flavor. 

The other specialty pancakes we tried were the Cinnamon Tres Leches (the best, in my opinion-- DELICIOUS), the Smores (soso- basically just pancakes with chocolate chips and cinnamon cereal and marshmallows on it), and the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut (our second favorite, our second favorite after the Tres Leches).

As for the service, the place was really really crowded. We arrived around 11:45 and it was about a 30 minute wait. I kind of felt like we were rushed, as the server kept asking to take away our plates. Despite how often she came by to try to clear the table, we got zero refills on coffee or drinks. Not even water. It wasn't until she bright the check that she asked if we wanted more coffee. I get that it's busy, but I feel like they should pay more attention to their service, rather than try to rush out all their diners."}
{"text":"After a night out on the town, I came to visit my brother and nurse a hangover with some good food. He suggested we come to Babystacks Cafe - foodie adventures run in my family genes. After a bit of a wait (the place was packed), we were seated. 

Everything on the surrounding tables looked and smelled amazing. I wanted to order one of each! But with a queasy stomach from too many drinks, I settled on something simple so as not to upset my equilibrium. I got the bacon and eggs breakfast which came with three strips of bacon, eggs any style, potatoes or hash browns, and two pancakes. Although simple, it was absolutely delicious. The breakfast potatoes were so tasty. And I upgraded my pancakes to try their infamous Red Velvet pancakes. SO GOOD. 

So if you're looking for a great breakfast/lunch spot off The Strip, come to Babystacks Cafe."}
{"text":"Hmmm. I have mixed feelings about this one. I'm a huge sweets person and thought previously I could sustain on dessert alone. I can't. The famed red velvet pancakes are literally a flattened red velvet cake with whipped cream AND cream cheese syrup. Sugar with sugar on top of sugar. On my quest to give myself type II diabetes, this certainly could do the trick.

I could definitely see myself coming back here, but maybe for some more savory fare. I felt sick to my stomach after eating about half the short stack. It's like when you're a teenager and you think that Mike's Hard Lemonade is a) good and b) a good way to get drunk. I've graduated to getting drunk off classier items (Zima) and should have graduated to something less sugary for my midday meal."}
{"text":"Go To breakfast stop! We bring any Vegas visitor to Babystacks. The pancakes are amazing and highly suggested! Wait times can be long so arrive early or after 1100.  Don't miss out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in the city. The pancakes are by far the best thing on the menu but everything else is also very delicious."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a friend, who swore the pancakes were fantastic. And he was right, they really are.

We came around 1 in the afternoon, so we avoided the typical breakfast/brunch/lunch rush hours. We were seated immediately and received good service throughout. Nothing super, but solid.

As soon as I looked at the variety of pancakes on the menu and on the specials board, I got excited. So many choices! I ended up going with an omelette with chili verde on it to go with 2 peanut butter and banana pancakes. The omelette itself was OK; it had all the elements of an omelette, but wasn't particularly fluffy. It was solid. The pancakes, though, were great! I am a sucker for both peanut butter and bananas, so maybe it wasn't that hard to impress me, but nonetheless, they were delicious. I also tried my friend's pancakes banana foster, which were one of the daily specials. He had ordered a large stack of pancakes (6 pancakes) and was overwhelmed by what came out. Those pancakes were pretty tasty and were pretty much like dessert.

What really interested me when I went to the restroom was the spam sandwich on a sweet roll that I saw in a newspaper review of BabyStacks. I'll be coming back, and that will most likely be what I order.

Solid breakfast/brunch destination; I'll definitely come back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Well I woke up really hungry. Especially from dieting a whole week, so I though... \"I wanna splurge, just a little more, today!\" So I was going to go to IHOP, but my brother and his family wanted to eat. And, we ultimately decided in Babystacks. 

This place was packed. I'm assuming it's because it's a new eatery and people wanted to try. We waited about 15 minutes before being seated.

I was having a hard time to decide because there was so much in the menu, which wasn't that aesthetic to the eyes. It was hard to understand the menu. 

I got spam and eggs with garlic rice and pancakes. The rest of the group got the fried rice, Portuguese sausage, red velvet pancakes and steak. 

I like my spam crispy and brown, this was lightly grilled and soft. The garlic rice was better than bland. It had flavor. BUT, it was still pretty bland. I could tell that there was onions and garlic powder but a little salt with the rice would have been better. 

Pancakes had a unique flavor. I've had really good, fluffy, sponge-like pancakes at different restaurants, but this was pretty dense and tasteless. (I do have really good tastebuds, that's why I'm on a diet from enjoying too much food.)

I'm not sure what the other Yelpers think is so great about this adobo fried rice, but I've had Hawaiian and Filipino fried rice... And THIS, was not authentic adobo. Instead of adobo meat, it was adobo rice with shredded meat. If you're a shoyu addict, enjoy this meal. It was soaked with soy sauce. Couldn't even taste the \"adobo meat,\" which I think was a pigment of my imagination in this dish. Reconsider the adobo fried rice, and get it somewhere else. 

Loco-moco's patties were flavorless, eggs were undercooked, food wasn't treated with love.

For the price of the food here, I would have gone somewhere else. If you're gonna have hawaiian-themed food, have hawaiian sized meals. 

I am super sad because I had high expectations. Food is not outstanding. Service was good. Wanted more out of it. I'm going to another place for b-fast."}
{"text":"Great new location southwest of the strip near mountains edge. Clean restaurant, friendly staff and great tasting food. Island style atmosphere with a modern touch. If you can't decide what to order, I recommend the adobo omelette. You won't be sorry. Soo good!"}
{"text":"Being out of town, we wanted to try a local cafe. After researching, I stumbled upon this place online and automatically the red velvet pancake and Hawaiian dishes got me. They reminded me of Hawaii. The wait was less than ten minutes for us. I, personally, ordered the adobo fried rice and red velvet pancakes and boy, were they delish. Starting with the adobo fried rice, you can definitely share this with another person. It was very big but that's the way it should be and the meat was season perfect. It was to die for that I wanted to bring it back to the hotel with me except we didn't have a microwave. Now, the red velvet pancake. Oh man, I devour that thing. From the whipped cream to the cream cheese sauce, there was nothing left on the plate. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Usually go to ihop but my mom and sister swore on this place so I said why not? NOW BABYSTACKS IS MY TO GO TO PLACE! The food was delicious! And the staff was great, Christopher was amazing! he was so sweet and funny. Definitely gonna keep going back."}
{"text":"Heaven on a plate!!! Everything is just so good . Had the loco loco with garlic rice it's just a must . Also had the veg omelette and German chocolate pancakes on he side . Sooooooo good."}
{"text":"Great service. My waiter was Mike, he was really nice and efficient. I asked for cheese on my scrambled eggs, I didn't get it, but I don't think he heard me. Not his fault. 

The restaurant is small! There are other locations, I went to the one at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch. Expect to wait on a Sunday (even with football at 1pm) but I promise it's worth it!

I couldn't decide on what to get. Red Velvet Pancakes are their best seller, but chocolate isn't really my thing.  Everyone around me ordered them...they must be good. I was torn between lemon ricotta, hazelnut and banana cream pie pancakes...(they need a sampler plate! For real!) I asked my waiter, Mike, his suggestion and he told me lemon ricotta was the way to go. Delicious!! But the pancakes are way HUGE. I mean huge. Bigger than your head. Think the size of a large dinner plate. The short stack is three pancakes. I went famished but finished about half.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were thin halfway between a pancake and a crepe and had a nice lemony taste. I squeezed on some fresh lemon and butter and dipped them in cream cheese syrup (WHAT???) and had a foodgasm. 

I am going back to try some more!

My bill came to $16.50. Very reasonable.  I had coffee, oj, short stack of pancakes, and a side of scrambled eggs. I'd probably skip the eggs, not great...and since the pancakes are so huge I wouldn't have needed them if I'd known."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never written a review about this place, I come here about once a month. It's really delicious. My favorite thing is bananas fosters crepes, which I only just recently tried. They are messy but worth it. You're going to ruin your shirt or need to wear a bib, but then again I am a messy eater so you can't take me anywhere nice and my clothes get ruined fast. My brother visited me and he had the bananas foster pancakes, he thought they were great! I have tried other pancakes they have, lemon ricotta are strong runner up. Myself I don't like red velvet that much, but it never fails that I see someone order them and they always seem to be in the middle of a foodgasm. The staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Baby Stacks is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Las Vegas.  Good service and great food.  Expect a wait.  It is a popular place."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hype about it and maybe I missed the best stuff on the menu, but I don't think it is anything special. That's just my opinion and clearly other people love this place but I just think there are better breakfast places for the money."}
{"text":"Never been to this Blue Diamond location. Love it because it's so much closer to my house. I got one sweet cream cheese crepe & added strawberries & upgraded to banana foster. It was a veerery sweet crepe, could've ate more if it didn't have the caramel. I would say 7/10 Also I got a side of garlic rice... honestly just tasted like white rice & a bunch of onions. Not really any garlic flavor. It was a bit on the greasier side. If it was a fried rice with more garlic & a little seasoning it could've been great. Garlic rice for me is a 6/10."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place except the wait but the wait is worth it and tells you it's good so that's NOT a \"complaint\". The service is great and fast. I've been to 2 of their locations, both on Buffalo and was equally satisfied. I love their banana fosters and red velvet pancakes and I get their omelette made into a skillet.. Tlkn about it, I think I'll go get one again today. I moved here a year ago and always bring visiting family to this spot and they share my love for their food. Highly recommended especially if you like pancakes."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've ever had! Every flavor is to die for. We tried the lemon ricotta that has more of a crepe texture, cinnamon roll, a special Oreo cookie and they were all delicious and different. You won't be disappointed. Make sure all your party is there and plan to wait at least 25 min."}
{"text":"yum doesn't even begin to describe it. 
I had the bananas foster stack.  incredible.  just the right amount of everything. I got a side of bacon too, excellent.  one friend got the red velvet stack, he was in love.  another friend got a skillet, you could tell it was fabulous by the way she ate it. 

nice place.  clean.  helpful and friendly wait staff. good seating with enough room. only drawback for me, it was absolutely freezing inside.  reminded me of my days of standing in a deep freeze for an hour at a time,  brrrr"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but when it comes to seating it's ridiculous. They're so precise about all of your party being here I couldn't believe it. It's so inconvenient. I only had one person missing because she was parking and the lady almost didn't want to sit us. Terrible."}
{"text":"Ok, so....  Knowing I had a day off on MLK day, my mouth started notifying me that it would again like to indulge in red velvet pancakes.  I submitted to the request, and got to Babycakes at just about 9am.  There were 3 tables open, so no wait.  Huge improvement!  It was again a weekday, though, and I noted that 15 minutes after I was seated, there were indeed approximately 10 people waiting.  That being said, I decided to tweak my ordering to include one of the Polynesian elements of the menu, and rather than getting potatoes or hash browns with my over-medium eggs and peppered bacon (yum), I got a mound of garlic and onion fried rice.  Very good call on my part.  The rice was slightly crispy and had slivers of onion and whole cloves of garlic which had a roasted, rather than pungent, flavor.  It was delish with the eggs!  And, as the trip demanded, I upgraded my pancakes to 2 small red velvet pancakes.  My taste buds cried a little.  :)"}
{"text":"5 star concept, 3 star food, but I'll take the average.  This place is all about the pancakes.  They do itty bitty pancakes which is great if you want to try a bunch of fun flavors / not overdose on the enormous pancakes that are usually offered at most brunch establishments.  That being said, the food was just ok.  I think it's a great local spot, but not somewhere I'd go out of my way for.  The service was nice but incredibly slow and disorganized.  Our food came out in weird increments (about 15 min apart) so that wasn't great."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm food delish! I had the kalua pork grilled cheese with garlic rice. The grilled cheese with the juicy kalua pork was amazing. My husband had the huevos rancheros scramble and ate it before I could try it, (he liked it) but shared his macadamia nut white chocolate pancakes....holy heaven:)))) The service was great, friendly, attentive and helpful as it was our first time. My new favorite breakfast spot:)"}
{"text":"It feels like home cuz it's Hawaiian built. They always welcome and handle their guest with hospitality. I don't even have to ask for anything when it comes to refills or condiments. They always beat me to it. At least that's my experience. 

Of course the menu has Hawaiian style food you would typically eat for breakfast which is always tasty. But the main attraction is their pancakes! 
You have to stop by for the pancakes! My favorite is the red velvet and macadamia pancakes! 

Everything is affordable to choose from and a family oriented environment."}
{"text":"First off, I love our waitress Danielle. She was so accommodating with a high energy personality.  Danielle was very friendly, fast paced and always looked out for our needs without us having to wait. She even threw in a free mac salad on the side which was also accommodating. My friend and I were very pleased with her service! 

My friend and I ordered the Chili Moco, Lolo's Adobo Fried Rice,  Buttermilk Pancakes and the Red Velvet Pancakes. The prices were moderately inexpensive and they were big portioned plates. I had to take my food to go, along with my pancakes because this was very filling and delicious. 

I also ordered another Red Velvet shirt stacks to go and she definitely hooked us up! I got three stacks of pancakes with extra extra cream and syrup on the side! Way to go! It was very satisfying. 

I only had one dislike about an item and it was the macaroni salad. I know we just got it on the house, but i just wanted to bring up the critique of the food. It was very watery so the flavor was pulled out of the macaroni salad which made it taste flat. If it was a little more dryer, I would definitely hold up its texture and flavor next time."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. This is a smaller location than the other baby stacks. There will be a line regardless of which location you will go. The longest I wait was 30 mins, but it also depends on your party. Service also depends on your waiter and how busy it is that day. Also keep in mind, this location does not split the checks right now. 

The food is delicious. I always get the chili moco and upgrade to garlic rice. It's basically a loco moco with Hawaiian chili on top. You can also upgrade If you are extremely hungry it might not full you up. I also add red velvet pancakes to it. Their red velvet pancakes are amazing. They are sweet, but not overly sweet. The sauce you pour over the pancakes compliments the pancakes very well. 

Lolo adobo fried rice omelette is pretty good as well. It is a savory dish if you are looking for something like that. It is the \"locals favorite\".

I also love their lemon ricotta. The best way to describe it is that it is like a crepe. It comes out on a huge plate. But I noticed the size has been getting smaller over the years. Which makes me sad. But the flavors are amazing and it light on your stomach. One of my favorite items on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab some lunch with my Mom the other day.  I've read many of the Yelp reviews raving about the Red Velvet Pancakes and had to experience this for myself.  Based on the familiar items of SPAM, Portuguese Sausage, and other island style dishes....I'm guessing that the owners are from the Pacific Islands.

I ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes (Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup. $5.25), which are 3 Pancakes about 8 inches in diameter each.....and a side order of Portuguese Sausage.  Mom ordered the Jalapeno Burger ($8.75).

The food came out in short order and I eagerly started on my Red Velvet Pancakes......they were freakin' AWESOME!  Wow, I was blown away with the Sweet, Soft, Velvety flavor and texture.  I should have ordered a full order dammit.

I then took a few bites of the Portuguese Sausage.....it was disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the flavor of it at all and it didn't taste like the Portuguese Sausage I was accustomed to eating when I'm in Hawaii.  Bummer.

Mom couldn't finish her Jalapeno Burger, so she gave me a few bites.  I thought it was OK, nothing special.  Certainly not worth $8.75.

Our server was friendly and on top of things.  Overall, a nice breakfast experience.

Will I return?  Those Red Velvet Pancakes are calling me....."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes are their claim to fame and deservedly so. The flavor is just right, not bland at all and definitely not too sweet. Other menu items that are worth checking out are the Huntington Omelet, Corned beef hash and eggs, country fried steak... I must say, the adobo fried rice wasn't that great. Not as tasty as I thought it could be. Their seasoned potatoes need a little bit more seasoning as well... Otherwise, a good mom and pops style breakfast joint. Expect a wait though!!!"}
{"text":"Good was great & server was fantastic! Jacob was super friendly & attentive. We tried the breakfast burrito with a side of bacon pancakes. Kids has chicken tenders w/ fries, BLT, egg/sausage/hash browns/pancake. We'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. 
Service is almost always great! Except last time the lady that delivered our food (I'm assuming she's either a server or a busser- she had long dark hair in a ponytail) came and told us around 1:30pm that they were closed. Her exact words were \"is there anything else you want? We're closed.\" It was extremely rude and condescending. There were others in the restaurant still consuming their food and I just found it disrespectful."}
{"text":"Ohh man.... this place is soo good! My friend recommended this place. He said to try the Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm glad I listened. 

The drive is like 20 mins from the strip. I walked in and it was packed. Decided to take food to go. Ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes and the Loco Moco. Shoots!! First off let me tell you about the pancackes. Soft, moist & delicious!! The taste was not to sweet like a regular Red Velvet cake. The cream frosting and crushed macadamia nuts complimented it just right. And the Loco Moco was the biz! Gravy was soo good! It had little chopped up mushrooms too. Patty and egg cooked just right. This place will definitely be a must next time I'm back in Vegas. I highly recommend that you try this spot out."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious and abundant breakfast, and very casual atmosphere.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Thank you for having a plant based option so my husband can enjoy Loco Moco and I can enjoy his company for breakfast. Delicious steel cut oats with peanut butter and banana."}
{"text":"It is the best pancakes in Vegas ! If you like red velvet , banana fasters , Cinnabon just two name a few if you can think it they have or can make it !!! ;) I love baby stacks :p"}
{"text":"Let's be clear. The food and service here is awesome!! I'm giving 3 stars for a very specific reason. It's over 105 degrees outside...and easily 80 degrees in the dining area. I can only imagine how hot the kitchen is. Guests and servers alike are visibly sweating. Moms are fanning their babies (no kidding). There are ceiling fans on but not doing much. It's uncomfortable to say the least- hoping we'll be able to enjoy the food. 

We asked if the AC is broken and were told it's just how it is here in the summer. Apparently employees have told management repeatedly but to no avail. 

I'm hoping to be able to revisit and give more stars next time. If it's this hot next time we come we'll have to wait until fall to come back."}
{"text":"Okay food waitress suggested something I really didn't want to try but it turned out to be okay after all. It was the French toast with the cereal all over it. Felt like I gained 10 pounds."}
{"text":"An impromptu Vegas trip brought me to this marvelous place of brunch goodness. With island staples of Loko Moko and various Kalua Pig dishes on the menu, this little hole in the wall brings tasty Hawaiian dishes with a brunch twist. They also offer \"normal American breakfast items\" on their menu, but definitely try the Hawaiian fare!

Seemingly the weekends are busy, so be prepared to wait. The actual place is relatively small, so that also contributed to the wait time. My personal wait ended up being around 30 minutes but well worth it. The service was on point, and the time it took for the food to arrive after being seated was waaayyy shorter than the actual wait to be seated. 

I will be sure to stop by again when I am hungover and leaving Nevada. Mahalo Babystacks Cafe!"}
{"text":"Visited this place twice while in Vegas.  Short 5 miles from the strip and absolutely worth it!  The food was amazing!  Service spectacular!  Nice view of the mountains on the way to an awesome meal.  We will be back next time!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but both times we went here it smelt like sewer! We could barely eat our food with out gagging. We probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Holy jeezus! This food is awesome! Every time someone comes in from outta town, I take them here. The kalua pig eggs benedict and the red velvet pancakes are to die for! I recently just got the rocky road pancakes and YES! They are also a must =)"}
{"text":"A larger group of us went in at eleven on a Tuesday and we only had to wait and fifteen minutes for a table which is not bad at all!  We where greeted promptly even though the place was packed.  The server was very nice and attentive wish I could remember her name.... she had dark hair, skinny, and tan. I had never been here before but everyone else had.... I was very impressed with my pancakes! I got the PB and ?... I choose bananas then added Nutella it was sooo good!  I have a picture of my nephews rocky road ones which where also delicious! I got two different omelettes ( shared with my boyfriend) and they where both good.  Let's just say there was ten of us and we all enjoyed our food a lot! And the price for everyone's food and drinks was about $140 which is really good for a family of ten I think. I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Lines can be long so come early, they open at 8!

Adobo Fried rice is awesome. So are there red velvet pancakes. I usually ask for 'as a side' can never finish the meal. Service can be so-so. I had both, hit or miss, but come back for the good food!"}
{"text":"Pancake lovers unite! Whether you like plain ol' buttermilk or rich red velvet, their menu aims to please with several different specialty iterations of a breakfast classic. My personal fave is their banana cream pie pancakes.

Babystacks has an obvious Hawaiian flair, even down to the music. If you're from the islands like me, you'll be happy to find portuguese sausage and rice on the roster served with aloha here.

The place isn't that huge, but it does get crowded especially on weekends, so expect a wait unless you're there the minute they open. Decor and layout are simple and laid back, but the eats are definitely the star."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place for breakfast until now. The food quality has deteriorated along with the service too. Even McDonald's serve a better quality burger....so sad"}
{"text":"Go at an odd time or get take out! 

The times I've been here, albeit during prime brunch hours, have always had a long wait. 30-45 minutes usually but I can imagine it being much worse. (I know it could be worse)

That being said and you being warned, Babystacks is a pretty decent place to grab brunch/breakfast in Henderson! 

Located in a strip mall and adjacent to Genghis Grill, their menu has typical breakfast items and has a Hawaiian flare as well with items such as spam, Portuguese sausage and Pork Adobo Fried Rice.

Now back on that Pork Adobo Fried Rice. It's the fried rice wrapped in an omelette. If that sounds amazing to you, it's because it simply is. I've ordered this twice and enjoyed it everytime. It comes with a side of mac salad and your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. You can also sub the sides for an order of pancakes (some may include an extra fee)!

The red velvet pancakes were ok imo. Mine kind of fell apart on me when I tried to cut them and their tastiness was because of the cream cheese syrup.

My one gripe about this place is the early closing time.  2pm everyday?? (3pm on Saturday/Sundays) But still.. I love having breakfast foods throughout the day so that's the bleh part for me."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes- yummy! Fluffy on the inside and crisp edges. 

Ranchero skillet - it was okay. The flavor was good but the chicken pieces were teeny tiny and could only taste potato. So that was a big disappointment. Friend got the Cowboy skillet and his ham pieces were microscopic! See picture for size comparison. 

Sanitation- worker dropped his towel on the ground and wiped a table with it without sanitizing it again so makes me wonder how careless they are in the kitchen. Big thumbs down."}
{"text":"When ever we come to Las Vegas we always have to make a special trip to this place. I am glad there is a second location so we don't have to wait a long to to be seated now. Be sure to get here early otherwise the line gets long. Everything on the menu is AAAA++++  i especially love the lemon pancakes"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you're from the islands or want to know how people from Hawaii eat, you should eat here. The vibe is nice, however they don't take reservations, so make sure everyone's there when you walk in the building. I had their Portuguese sausage and eggs with garlic rice. They do put a lot of garlic so BEWARE! Also the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. Despite how busy it always is, the customer service is always great, and the food is amazing! Try their red velvet pancakes! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good had the red velvet pancakes, and some other dishes that were good as well. Nice breakfast place overall"}
{"text":"I love this place. The wait sucks, but it is usually worth it. I've been here and the first location several times with my kids. They will even wait knowing that they will get to eat the best red velvet and bananas foster pancakes ever. We also love the cinnabun and carrot pancakes. No matter what, ask for their cream cheese sauce. Amazing. As for entrees, my personal favorites are the adobo fried rice (being Filipino) and Kalua pig eggs Benedict. I also ventured to try out the Mexican skillet. Wow. Yeah, leave your diet at home and don't ask for nutritional facts. You are here for the food coma.

They are really five stars, but I deducted one for the long wait. FYI: it is usually a 30-45 minute wait on Saturday / Sunday after 9am so bring your coffee, iPad, knitting project or newspaper to help pass the time. You will be pancake hoarding in no time. They have a few TVs in there for watching football games ;)"}
{"text":"Get there early or you might be waiting for a while (I went on a week day) and they won't seat you until your whole party gets there. The waitress was alright, took our order, gave us our drinks, refilled our drinks, served us our food, and handed us the check.

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak meal; the chicken fried steak was thick but cooked thoroughly, their gravy was delicious. His only complaint was the eggs and hash browns were  bland. 

I ordered the white chocolate macadamia nuts pancakes (short stack) and only finished two out of the three. It was delicious, but I wish there were more white chocolate and powdered sugar on top and more nuts in the pancakes.  

Overall, we might go back after trying a few more local breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I have been here twice...and I'm glad I gave them a second try.  I love the unique pancakes this breakfast place offers.  Carrot cake pancakes, red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, and many more!  I was fortunate to try both the red velvet and carrot cake pancakes...YUM!  I had the Huntington Omelet both times (without the bacon) which had just cheese, avocado, and salsa served with country-style potatoes.  Good, but not extraordinary.  Coffee and OJ are average, but also good.  There are other unique items on their menu such as the adobo fried rice omelet (adobo fried rice wrapped in an \"egg burrito\") which my hubby liked.  Menu does not include many options for non-meat eaters (like myself), but there is a create-your-own omelet option.  

Service was not really good the first time (I got my pancakes after I was almost done with my meal...my hubby got his pancakes with this meal), but the second time was better.  The owner even came around to check on us.  Tables are tiny (if ordering pancakes plus meal, the plates don't fit!) so it's almost better to go as a three-or more party to get a bigger table...or to ask for one of the high tables, which look a little bigger.  

After the first visit, I was reluctant to try them again.  But thanks to some coaxing from a friend, I decided to give them another chance.  Although this is not my favorite breakfast place, I would still go back to try more of their unique pancake creations and to support a local Filipino business. 

I'm hoping each time I try it, I'll like it better and rate it better.  For now...3 stars."}
{"text":"No, if I could give zero stars I would!!! The hostess and manager were so rude. Four of us arrived an hour before we were given a table bit that us NOT the reason why this establishment deserves NO stars. It is because their manager says, \"fuck you, get out\" after we asked to be moved to a different table since we were split into two. What kind of hospitality is this? Surely this establishment should be out of business."}
{"text":"This Babystacks was pretty busy but still didn't make me wait THAT long.  The server my party had was nice,  very welcoming, and most of all very open to sharing her opinions with us. Their specialty pancakes are for the most part amazing.  I personally love their red velvet pancakes.  The cream cheese icing they have on the side acts as a syrup.  I feel that it compliments the red velvet pancakes so much more than regular maple syrup ever could.  The Portuguese sausage was fair at best.  It was a little undercooked but that's my only complaint.  All in all I would love to go back."}
{"text":"Really good red velvet pancakes. So fluffy. The cream cheese syrup was the bomb. Also had the adobo fried rice omelette. It was ok, prefer to have more garlic flavor (absent) on my fried rice. The menu looks awesome and wanted to try more stuff like the Kahlua pork Benedict, but had too much food from the buffets the night before. I will definitely hit this place up again next time we are in Vegas, make it a place to go to on the way back home. If anything, just to come back for that red velvet cupcake."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a decent breakfast in Vegas, and was not disappointed.  

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, with bacon pancakes.

The CFS had a good texture.  The gravy was good.  The eggs were a little underdone for \"Over Medium\", but that's up to interpretation.  But enough of this.  This is a pancake joint, so let's talk about those.  The bacon pancakes were very good.  They had bacon in them, and on them.  They were springy and resilient without being tough.  Not too soft or hard, but just about perfect.  They were flavorful, and very tasty.  

The service was good.  The waitress pleasant.  Everything was pretty quick.  The cost was decent.  Were I a local, I'd probably come here often.

About the only thing that I can ding them on, and the reason this isn't a five star review, is that the coffee is not great.  It's on par with the other places I've been in Vegas, but not great.  I'm a coffee snob, and can't handle what tastes like something that came pre-ground in pre-measured bags."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone here twice so far and are dying to go back again. The first time we went, he got the lemon ricotta pancakes with his steak and eggs and I got the cinnabon pancakes with my egg breakfast. Absolutely delicious, especially the lemon ricotta. They have a cream cheese icing for some of the pancakes that I just want to drink by itself.

I know how gross that sounds, but once you try it, you'll understand. 

The second time we went, which was just this morning, we had our same server and hostess! I loved that. They are both super smiley and welcoming. My boyfriend got the same as before and this time, I got the \"make your own skillet\" with carrot cake pancakes. I almost ate all of my pancakes before I even started on the skillet which had mushrooms, onions, and green bell peppers over potatoes with melted cheese. I chose cheddar and got scrambled eggs. With some cholula drizzled on top, I was in heaven. I enjoyed every bite and every bit of service :P they rock! We will definitely be going back soon. :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the adobo fried rice but it was a tad bit to salty. It was still really good! The prices were great for what came with it especially since the Red velvet pancakes were definitely a PLUS The service was great as well & we waited under 10 minutes to receive our food. I would definitely suggest Baby Stacks to my friends & family!!"}
{"text":"I've been to their other locations and by far the Henderson Baby Stacks has no sense of urgency and horrible customer service. First, is it unprofessional to be chewing gum while on the job. Second, it took quite awhile to get asked for coffee. In additional, a refill while waiting 30 min or so for our food. Last, the cashier had bad customer service... No thank you, please come back again, nothing. Their staff needs to be trained on customer service or management just needs to get a new set of staff. I rather drive to centennial, buffalo, or flamingo for better service. Yes, it is that bad."}
{"text":"Love this place! Get there early or be prepared to wait. It's small, so seating is limited but it's worth the wait. I have never had anything bad there, and the service is always great! We go every couple of weeks, it's the only place we go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"awesome breakfast place! i heard a LOT of good things about babycakes...mostly the red velvet pancakes. I LOVE red velvet anything so after hearing about them i had to come and try them. the pancakes did not disappoint! SO GOOD! they are a bit sweet so eating an entire order yourself is probably not a good idea. =P my friends and i order a full stack of the pancakes to share and then each got something else. i ordered the kalua pig benedict...i had to try it after reading about it on yelp. it was good. there needed to be a bit more flavor to the pig but overall it was tasty. the potatoes that came with the dish were awesome! perfectly salted and not greasy like a lot of breakfast places. my friends ordered the adobo fried rice and the breakfast burrito with a side of garlic fried rice. the adobe fried rice was delicious...a tad salty but good. i didn't try the burrito but had some of the garlic fried rice and that was good too. don't think i would get a side of it...it had a bit too much onions in it. service was great. there is a bit of a wait on the weekends but totally worth it. i can't wait to come back! =)"}
{"text":"Pancakes are so delicious. So is chili and potatoes and everything. Food is amazing but there is always a wait to be seated: once you're seated though they are quick and attentive. They need to get a bigger place. Lol"}
{"text":"Huge menu...lots of options. They also have turkey sausage and turkey bacon for those of you that don't do swine. 5 kinds of benedicts and of course a ton of different kinds of pancakes. My husband had the carrot cake pancakes and said they were amazing...the space is a little small and can get cramped when it is busy, but other than that it is a great little neighborhood breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Best. Pancakes. Ever. They were super busy but  we were seated immediately, service was great and food came out fast. The banana foster pancakes are like if an orgasm was a food. They use real eggs instead of the egg powder places like IHOP and Denny's use. They need a bigger location so I don't have to look at so many other peoples faces while I eat."}
{"text":"Update.  I've been back to Babystacks a few more times and have had better service on recent visits, plus the food has been consistently good.  Today, Liliana was our server and she was very nice and efficient. 

I ordered the BYO omlette with spinach, tomatoes, ham, and cheddar with breakfast potatoes, and the bananas foster pancakes-$9.25, plus $1.50 for the upgraded pancake choice.  The pancakes were fantastic!  Basically dessert for breakfast.  All that was missing was the table side flambé.  The omlette was good, but I would ask for less cheese next time.  After eating 1/2 the omlette and 1/2 of the pancakes, there was no room for potatoes, but were a little dry anyway.

John had the Country Fried Steak and Eggs -$12.95, he said that it was delicious and would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"I decided to bring my parents they are visiting from Hawaii because I have ate here in the past and it was really good. Well complete opposite we waited 10 minutes for table and another 25 minutes for food .  There was a piece  of hair In my potatoes and my moms pancakes were cold . The adobo omelet wasn't impressive either, what happened?  I told the waitress and she argued with me that I was wrong and that food came out immediately . I would'nt have written this if she didn't do that but she knew we were unhappy and didn't do anything, but argue back with me ."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, but the the red velvet pancakes were too good to be true.

we ordered:

red velvet pancakes: delicious! especially with the cream cheese syrup and little bit of whipped cream. not overly sweet  

white chocolate macademia pancakes: Regular buttermilk pancakes with a few macademia nuts inside, also sprinkled on top are the white chocolate chips. I was hoping they would have incoporated melted white chocolate into the batter somehow. It was okay, nothing too special. 3 stars.

kalula pig benedict: also something worth trying if you're into hawaiian food. 4 starts outta five for this dish. 

Definitely worth the drive, you can just order the red velvet pancakes and you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Yess! My favorite breakfast place is now on the south side of town making it easier for those who don't want to travel all that way up to the northwest. This location is a bit bigger than the original, but of course all the food especially the pancakes still taste the same. I've been here on 2 visits and my most recent I ordered something other than my usual selections of kalua pig benedict and red velvet pancakes. They had a dry erase board with new menu selections and it had things like kalua pig grilled cheese and breakfast sliders. Both sounded delish, but after reading the description of the breakfast sliders it seemed like it was something I could make on my own making me choose the kalua pig grilled cheese! Loved every bite of it because it had a good amount of pork in there and meshed well with all the cheesey goodness. I've heard from friends and from my own personal experience that the other pancake options cannot compare to the red velvet, does anyone know of another pancake they offer that is just as spectacular?

P.S. they over estimate the wait time because on several occasions I have been seated sooner than the original time they told me."}
{"text":"This is a Hawaiian fusion breakfast place.

There are several locations for this restaurant and they are all fairly consistent in food and service.  They tend to be crowded on weekend breakfast and brunch so get there early or expect a wait.

Service tends to be good without any major complaints.

The food here is excellent.  The pancakes are varied with more options than any other comparable restaurant I've been to.  Somehow they are able to get their pancakes crispy, light, and fluffy without any greasiness. Their Hawaiian inspired dishes are great and the standard American style breakfasts are well prepared.

Try their red velvet pancakes and the Loco Moco substituting Kalua pork and garlic rice.  Amazing."}
{"text":"We love Babystacks.  Definitely known for their Adobo Fried Rice and numerous pancake creations, there is something for everyone.  Today I did a more traditional bacon and eggs, but had to add the Garlic Fried Rice. Tasty and very reasonable for price.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This babystacks cafe was the bomb for me and my wife...we split an omelette, which was cooked to perfection...hash browns were amazing, and the short stacks were very good, and fluffy...and the service was outstanding..."}
{"text":"Came alone today because I was just craving some baby stacks! My server was exceptional. The Huntington Skillet is by far my favorite skillet. The lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for! It sounded a little weird to me at first but I think they are my new fave over the White Chocolate, Red Velvet, Blueberry, and Carrot Cake pancakes.

{"text":"This is pertaining to the Stephanie location. The food is very good, don't get me wrong...but the service? This is the first time eating here, the waiter comes and we order water, almost 10 min later he brings it and walks away. I wait for him to come back to ask for straws, but he's no where to be found so I get up and ask for some. So we FINALLY get to order, food came quickly, but no utincels. I ask for some. We have toast, but doesn't offer any jelly, I have to ask for some. My son's water was getting low... no one to refill it. The place wasn't even busy because it was almost closing time. I love the food, but next time I'll visit a different location"}
{"text":"Babystacks!!! I love this place. I always order the same thing, every single time I come. Rice, sausage, egg and hazelnut pancakes. I love how the pancakes here are not overbearingly sweet, just perfect."}
{"text":"Love Babystacks, and this was my first time at this specific location. Came for brunch and we were seated pretty quickly. Took a while for all three of us to make a decision, they never rushed us just allowed us to take our time. With each order he went over our options. I had a breakfast burrito with an upgrade of red velvet pancakes. Both were really good and tasted freshly made. Another in my party had Adobo Fried Rice and enjoyed it. The third party had a Piglet skillet. He liked it but said \"he's had better. 

I felt they were very accommodating and checked on us regularly. I've always enjoyed their food and service at all of their locations, and will be visiting this particular location more regularly from here on out."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes...need I say more!? Homemade whipped cream, icing and a chocolate sprinkle...heaven on a plate. Many of there breakfast items come with buttermilk pancakes on the side, but spend the extra $1.50 for these. You can also order them as a main breakfast plate, but I find that can sometimes be a bit much as far as an over-sweet experience and on the side you get just enough to experience them firsthand. 

Some of the things I usually get is the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage or the Adobo friend rice, both tasty and winning dishes. Service is quick and they will continue to come by and refill your coffee or water without having to ask or search around for assistance.

The location at Smoke Ranch is by far the best, but that being said it's almost always packed with people and there's a wait. If you go to the other by Flamingo, it's MUCH less crowded. They have one other location and I also heard a Henderson location is on the way.

They do ask for ID if you are paying by debit or credit, so just to be aware.

Good stuff....yummy goodness!"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place that my husband and I finally decided to try it. It was ridiculously busy as expected. However, even when we were told it was a 25 minute wait, we were actually seated in 15 minutes. I commend the staff because in spite of the volume they had today, we didn't wait long for our orders to be served and the wait staff were all very attentive. I love the red velvet pancakes!!! Will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"I love BABYSTACKS CAFE and I'm so happy they opened this location near my house. Everything on the menu is yummy! If you are looking for a great place to eat for brunch then be sure to come here. The services, the atmosphere & food is worth it! 

My favorite is the Kula eggs benedict. It is to die for, you have to try it. Make sure you order some red velvet pancakes OMG you'll thank me later! Other favorite dishes are the Adobo Omelet, Loco Moco and Lola Coras Corned beef hash.

Every time I have family visiting, we always eat at Babtystacks café and they always want to go back!"}
{"text":"You just have to love BabyStacks Café.   

I came in here for lunch with a couple of my coworkers.  I kept bugging them on trying this place out. Yup just like I predicted, they were a huge fan. 

I ordered the Kula Pic Eggs benedict. OMG it was amazing. It was so yummy. I would have never thought to mix these two together. 

After telling my coworker it's a must to order their famous Red Velvet pancakes, I had to order on for myself. They fell in LOVE with them. 

Customer service is always great when I come here. Sometimes the wait is long but, don't let that stop you cause trust me it will all be worth it. 

I do love how BabyStacks do get involved in our community of Las Vegas.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I love BABYSTACKS CAFE. This is the BEST BRUNCH PLACE IN LAS VEGAS. Everything on the menu is yummy! If you are looking for a great place to eat for brunch then be sure to come here. The services, the atmosphere & food is worth it! 

My favorite is the Kula eggs benedict. It is to die for, you have to try it. Make sure you order some red velvet pancakes OMG you'll thank me later! Other favorite dishes are the Adobo Omelet, Loco Moco and Lola Coras Corned beef hash. 

If you love pancakes like i do then this spot has a lot to choose from. From tradition pancakes to another of my favorites, the \"Rocky Road\" pancakes. 

Every time I have family and friends visiting Las Vegas, we always eat at Babtystacks café and they always want to go back! 

Be sure to come early because it does get busy (especially during the weekend) but trust me it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"A place that actually lived up to its hype.

I've been hearing about this place and I finally got to try it! I was surprised at how easy it was to get a seat here at 9 am on a saturday. I was expecting more people to be here.

Service: everyone was pretty friendly. The waitresses and waiters always made sure out coffee cups were full and let us know the status of our food. 

I decided to try the cookie butter French toast. Omg so good! I was a little hesitant because it sounded like it would be too sweet for me, but it was perfect. It was French toast with cookie butter in the middle of the breads, drizzled with Nutella. It was a little crispy on the outside and soft on te inside. If this was anything like the rest of their menu, I'm definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely inedible. I was so disappointed. Pancakes were dry, coffees were cold. I was hungry when I left. Then waitress are oblivious and barely checked on us. She had no reaction to giving us out check with 2 full plates of food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Las Vegas , I can eat the red velvet pancakes every day!! They don't sit you until your whole party is there so make sure everybody shows up on time if you want to get seated in a timely manner. Place is kind of small and gets packed all the time so if you have 3 or four people you might want to call ahead to reserve a seat. Staff are very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian breakfast joint in north Las Vegas! I always get up grades to garlic fried rice and banana stacks! The service is good and wait lines are not that bad. Great Hardy breakfast"}
{"text":"I've been here over 10 times now and have never left a review. This is a great breakfast joint! The food is always good and the staff is always friendly. Go there now!"}
{"text":"My kids and i live going to this local gem for breakfast, the Adobo Fried Rice is really flavorful paired with some of thier lemon pancakes it's the perfect match. I recommend getting there earlier than later because there's almost always at least a 15-20 min wait."}
{"text":"Babystacks never disappoints and this most recent location is no different. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette is a must. You're welcome ..."}
{"text":"The Adobo Fried Rice. Omg. So good! Well seasoned and hearty! I ate half of it there and the other half later. Just thinking about it is making me salivate. The only problem was that it took a minute for me to finally dig into it when it was delivered to my table as I sat there with no utensils. My server walked by me. I was hoping she noticed I was just sitting there staring at this delicious looking/smelling goodness that I could not eat. Nope. So I had to ask. Maybe she was too busy? 

Anyway, I paired it with the red velvet pancakes. It's as amazing as everyone says it is. There were many other pancakes I wanted to try. I was actually torn between ordering the red velvet and the Orange creamsicle. Feeling like I had to make a decision, I chose the red velvet. After that, I decided I wanted to switch to the Orange creamsicle. Yes, that is annoying, but I decided I wanted to try the Orange creamsicle more. I asked if it was too late, and she straight up said \"yeah\"... Um... Ooookay then. While the red velvet was in fact tasty, I wasn't satisfied. I was filled with regret of not being able to try the Orange creamsicle. 

My server was really nice, but I wish she was more accommodating about me wanting to switch my pancakes. I did enjoy my food a lot tho. Definitely obsessed with the adobo fried rice! I wanna try more of the pancakes so hopefully I'm back in the area again soon. I guess next time I'll come in with a game plan of exactly what I want."}
{"text":"I was searching on Yelp for a breakfast place near our hotel.  Since we were up early at 6:30 am we decided to go to Baby Stacks when they opened.  Baby Stacks is located on the corner in a shopping center.  I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes and my BFF ordered the Red Velvet pancakes, corned beef hash, and potatoes.  She wasted the corned beef because she didn't like it.  I enjoyed my Cinnabon pancakes.  I would recommend ordering the short stack with a side dish.  If you have a sweet tooth, the red velvet pancakes were good too."}
{"text":"This place the best sweet cream crepes I've ever had. Ever. I order it every time I come here. I crave them every day. Get them with strawberries and you'll never want anything else in your mouth. Why do they close at 2?! WHY. And why don't they open one near UNLV? I'd never leave. GET THE CREPES. And the seasoned potatoes are pretty bomb.com too."}
{"text":"We have come here a few times for breakfast.  Usually there is a wait, but it isn't long and it's totally worth it. They do not take reservations and they will not seat you unless your while party is present. Food is always great. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"It's the perfect place for breakfast. Order the adobo fried rice for sure.The kids love the pancakes. Solid service and the food comes quickly. Only problem is there is always a 45 minute wait for a table - any time of day. Every day. But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here with my gf bc we've heard the hype and it's kinda close by.  Honestly,  not enough bang for the buck you have to pay for anything they have. I ordered a burrito, and it was the plainest, smallest breakfast burrito I've ever had. We went back a separate time,  thinking it was just the 1 time, nope! Never going back."}
{"text":"Once you get past the 45 minute wait, you're in for a real treat! There are so many incredible options for delightful breakfast meals that you might have a hard time settling on one! 

My suggestion is to go for the bananas foster; although my husband is a fan of the red velvet. The OJ is completely overpriced, so grab a cup of coffee and prepare to feast on some of the most incredible cakes to ever cross your lips. 

Great, now I want some :D"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Pancakes, country fried steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy... It's all awesome. Will be back to try more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at Babystacks and have been for over six years. I started going to the location near Buffalo and Flamingo because it was near my home. We moved across town and I started frequenting the location near Stephanie and Warm Springs. Now I've moved again and am located between two locations, the one on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch and the one I'm reviewing now that's located at Durango near Deer Springs. 

I prefer the location at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch, but with the severely limited seating options, there is often a wait, even on weekdays. This is my fourth visit to the Durango and Deer Springs location. This location has a large seating area, so there is almost never a wait, which is convenient. 

Needless to say, I know what my favorite Babystacks meal, the Honey [French] Toast is supposed to look and taste like. Before giving a poor review, I wanted to give the location a few tries to see if my experience was a one-time thing. Sadly it has not been. 

On my first visit by myself about two weeks ago I ordered my usual meal, the Honey Toast without powered sugar and coffee. The Honey Toast came out burned, very black on the back and along the edges. I went ahead a tried a bite to be fair, but it tasted like charcoal. In all my visits to Babystacks locations I had never gotten my Honey Toast in that condition. I showed my waitress and she brought me a new order of it, only slightly less burned, but the center of the Honey Toast was salvageable. I went ahead and ate it in disappointment. I didn't have the time to send it back again as I had somewhere to be. 

On my second visit on the weekend a few days later with my boyfriend my Honey Toast was okay, but the waitress brought out his food a full five minutes before mine. 

On my third visit a few days later the Honey Toast looked a little overdone, but eatable. However, when I put my fork into the whipped cream I came out with a kinky black hair. I showed the waiter and he had my food remade. 

Today I decided to give them one last try. My Honey Toast came out burned yet again. I pointed it out to the waitress, but told her not to bother reordering it. I'd eat the middle and call it good. I asked her to please let the cooks know because this keeps happening. My coffee was also served at room temperature, but at this point I barely noticed. 

I'm one of those customers that hates, absolutely hates having to send food back. It's embarrassing and I don't want to ever appear to be a b---h, and I don't want to ever risk the ire of the people making and handling my food. After three out of four bad experiences here, I'm done. I will not come to this location again. It's extremely disappointing to come to this conclusion because I've always seen Babystacks as a restaurant with high standards. This location fails miserably."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to a Babystacks, the first location I went to Durango and it didn't think it was horrible so I wanted to check out the location in Henderson. 

I feel like the long wait for a table on the weekends are inevitable, so be ready to wait and make sure that your whole party is there so once the table is ready you can go party with your pancakes and eggs. The food was OK, nothing extraordinary but I do favor their pancakes AND I'm a waffle kind of girl, so it's a kindaaaaaaaaa a huge deal! 

The decor is quaint and some tables are wobbly but their workers are sweet and very friendly and when you've been waiting an hour to sit down, those are the kind of people you need to be serving you. Overall good experience, and I definitely recommend their pancakes & adobo fried rice"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always busy but worth the wait! Everything on the menu is awesome but my favorite is the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet and the Nutella Crepes! YUM!"}
{"text":"Loved the Henderson location. The ppl are very family oriented and personable! Love Eric Awesome server!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Decent service. This is the second visit for us. The bacon pancakes are good. It definitely gets crowded but we sat at the counter so we were seated right away. We will try it a third time."}
{"text":"I loved this place felt like I was back in Hawaii. Had a nice comfy island feel to it and the food was awesome. The pancakes were incredible and there griddles are too. The prices are awesome ad well."}
{"text":"This place is completely amazing, I have been here three (3) times and have yet to sway away from the red velvet pancakes.  I'm sure they have many amazing things but wow these pancakes are out of this world.

They have taken breakfast food to a whole notha level!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to visit BabyStacks by the valet at the Palms Hotel.
It was a very short drive from the hotel, we waited the half hour for a seating and were not disappointed.
They have nice music playing that reminds me of my visit to Hawaii last year. The servers were cordial. Since the hotel food was soooooo expensive it was a welcome relief to see their pricing. 
As far as the food. We ordered burritos, pancakes and also the Spinach Benedict. I had some of each and loved each item. 
Funny... they don't bring pancake syrup with some of the pancakes. The sauces seem to be enough to dress the pancakes but we asked for syrup anyway. 
If your in Vegas and want a place to eat breakfast I recommend this place. The menu is extensive."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes are good, they are light and fluffy and not too sweet. The melted mini chocolate chips on top add a nice touch. I eat the pancakes plain and don't add any syrup or sauce because they get really sweet if you do.  I also ordered a side of garlic rice which was tasty until I took a big bite of garlic paste that wasn't spread through the rice well.
Expect to have a long wait if you come for breakfast, they tend to get busy and if they could move to a bigger venue that would make things better.

Would I go back? Only if the wait to be seated wasn't 30 minutes plus.

Weekdays are probably better days to go than the weekend"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try out Babycakes today after picking up a Groupon a week or two ago.  This place would have a shot at 5 stars if it wasn't for closing so early.  2pm?  In Vegas?  Come on, who's out of bed before 2pm in Vegas.

I had the peanut butter and banana pancakes and was a bit disappointed... the PB flavor was very faint (to me), but the waitress brought me a side of peanut butter to make up for it.  My girlfriend had the strawberry pancakes and she said it was one of the best pancakes she has ever had.  And she's a pancake fiend!

We somehow didn't get the red velvet pancakes, but we plan to get it next time.  Oh, we had a side of hash browns, too, and they were really, really good.

So close to a 5 star.  Make it 24 hours, guys.  Please?!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and it was alright. The one thing that annoyed me the most was that the server asked us what we wanted to drink before we even got a chance to sit down, look at the menu, and settle in! 
The servers look like they don't like their job, which is fine, just don't show it to your guests. I had the Hawaiian Benedict, which weren't bad, but the hash browns were a little hard. And my bf had a very bland adobo omelette. 
I would only visit this place again to try their pancakes. Hopefully I'll have better experience next time."}
{"text":"Yummy! I was never into breakfast/brunch food before but once in a blue moon it will hit the spot. Our party of 10 was well taken care of here with such great service and food. Considering we're in the city that never sleeps, after a good night of fun we were all famished the next morning. By word of mouth, we made a visit to BabyStacks and they did not disappoint! My girlfriend and I ordered their most popular dishes, the Loco Moco and the Adobo Omelette with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. Everything was so tasty!! My friends also ordered the Banana Pancakes and that was filling, but flavorful as well."}
{"text":"How in the world this place gets anything greater than one star is beyond me. Service was horrible. The server was way too busy to even acknowledge us. It was our first visit she didn't ask, it would have been nice to learn a bit more about what was good, etc but whatever. Barely acknowledged us rushed off checked on is once and it was in passing she was horrible. Now on to the food...... great pancakes??? Are you kidding me?? I guess if you like drywall and cement you would love these round globs of batter. No taste whatsoever!! If it was for the kalbi beef ribs this \"meal\" would have been a complete disaster! Won't be back don't get the hype."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast, lunch, or brunch! Too bad they are not open for dinner. :)

The food and service has always been great. But I had to give them 4 out of 5 stars because the wait for our food is a little longer than normal compared to similar restaurants."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad experience here.  The food is consistently good and prepared and served to my liking.  Although I don't really venture to the whole menu my breakfast is always delicious and served with a smile.  One meal here always gets me full and that means I go home and rub my belly.  That's a good thing."}
{"text":"Fella and I are so glad we found this place. We were trying to find places to eat away from the strip and fortunately came across this place. Their food is delicious. We mainly fell in love with the selection of pancakes they have; we ordered their chocolate and banana pancakes and both were fluffy and filled with flavor. We very much look forward to eating here in our future trips to Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"When we're in Vegas, we always hit up this place.  The wait is totally worth it.  They have large portions and it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of babystacks.. i pretty much always get the same thing .. Portuguese sausage and eggs can't go wrong with this dish.. the sausage are sautéed in a skillet with a little bit of burnt edges which is just how I like them. Eggs over easy with garlic rice.. perfect breakfast. I know they pride themselves on their pancakes but that doesn't draw me here .. they are a little stingy with the syrup but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"actually this restaurant doesn't even deserve a stsr! Horrible management no customer satisfaction! I will not return to thus restaurant. Food was not edible and didn't even touch my food but they never even bother to ask if they could do anything! That top it...Horrible do not go there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday morning last week.  Very quaint family run diner.  A little on the small side for Vegas but just about right for a nice sit down meal with friends and family.  Friendly atmosphere and staff make you feel like your in someone's home rather than a strip mall.

Although comfortable, I did not like the bar table setup we were seated at.  About half the seating is bar height and the rest your normal booth/chair setup.

Menu is a mixed bag of Breakfast fare, definitely Asian/Hawaiian influences with your typical pancakes, waffles, and benedicts.

What we tried:  Loco Moco; bland gravy and patty was prepackaged and had no flavor.    Adobo fried rice; definitely fried but no distinct adobo flavor...the presentation was odd as well, almost sent it back thinking I got the wrong order (rice is stir fried then folded into an omlette) .  The macaroni salad that came with the omlete was runny and bland...and seriously who serves mac salad for breakfast?

The food was decent but not exactly what I was expecting... I think maybe they are going for Hawaiian/Asain-Fusion on some of the items (Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict) but for the most part I think they are missing it.  

Gets pretty busy so make it early on a weekday to save yourself the wait."}
{"text":"The breakfast here was the bomb!! 

The service was incredibly slow, but our server seemed like he was doing his best. I think he was maybe just having an off day. My husband and I ate here when we were starving and jonesing for breakfast food, and this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"So good and always on point. Can get really busy, so expect a wait. Service is friendly with a smile. The pulled pork Benedict has settle flavors that just seem to work. Red velvet pancakes are so delicious with a sweet frosting topping. Have tried many dishes and have never been disappointed. A phenomenal breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Try um, You'll like um ! Adobo Fried Rice Omelet, LocoMoco, Portuguese Sausage Eggs & Rice, Red Velvet Pancakes & More. Aloha & Mabuhay"}
{"text":"This is a frequent go to for weekend breakfast/brunch.  They have such a wide variety of pancakes and Hawaiian staples.  I often get the Portuguese sausage egg sliders on Hawaiian rolls.  But it is also hard to pass on their crepes or red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"We have been to this location 3 times now and love it.  The service is friendly and the food is great!   I have never had a bad meal (well I take that back).  There was only one dish that wasn't as good as it could be, but that was probably how I ordered it.  You can tell that the ownership is Hawaiian by the menu and the decor.

Red Velvet pancakes:  TO DIE FOR!  The cream cheese syrup is super sweet so use sparingly.  They are so wonderful though!

Carrot cake pancakes:  Very good, but tough to live up to the red velvet that every other review praises.  


The chicken and chili omelet:  very well balanced, but a bit larger then I really needed with the pancakes, we can not finish both and always have extras. 

Honey toast: flavor very good, this is a good version of french toast and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a sweet breakfast dish.

I can not remember the exact name but this is what I ordered incorrectly: the skillet of eggs, potatoes, and pork with salsa on the side was a bit dry. This can be either ordered as a skillet or as an omelet (opt for the omelet).  the ingredients were good.

Overall, these were great meals and I have recommended BabyStacks to friends in the culinary industry.  This is a big compliment."}
{"text":"Great comfort food!! My family and I always hit up this place whenever we go to Vegas. It's a little off the strip, but definitely worth the drive. Everyone is so friendly and they have great service! I ALWAYS order my favorite dish- corned beef hash. Cooked perfectly all the time! It's always crispy yet soft. Their red velvet pancakes are BOMB too! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place leaves me speechless. My recommendations are the Portuguese sausage sliders and red velvet pancakes. My only problem here is that I order too much food. Everything is heavenly and I've ever had bad service. The only negative thing is the long waits during rush hours but what else can you expect from a place with such good food."}
{"text":"4 of us came in for Sunday breakfast and had just an OK experience. Like several other recent reviews, the service was quite a let-down. They may have been understaffed, however from our perspective the staff were inattentive and slow. 

The food was alright -- a touch cold due to everything being so slow -- but, I will say the Portuguese Sausage and Garlic Fried Rice are quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed the Loco Moco with garlic rice upgrade. A delicious explosion of flavor, through and through. Over easy egg over hamburger steak, over garlic rice, topped with brown gravy. 

The regular pancakes are good, the Bananas Foster pancakes were decent, the fried rice omelette was OK, and the chili loco moco was pretty good. 

I'd definitely return for the LM and also the great service. Our server may have been the happiest person in Las Vegas. Loco Moco all the way!"}
{"text":"this is an update.. I had to tell my grandparents to try this place and they finally did. They loved in , and with my papa (grandfather) who is from Hawaii. RAVED about it. he wants to go back already. My mama (grandma) enjoyed the red velvet pancakes so much and had a huge smile on her face. [ and she is so very picky]

we will return, and now will probably try the location on the sw side of town. the Service here is great! The staff is amazingly friendly. They are quick and the place is always busy now that must say something. we have never been here and not seen the place FULL"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE EVER! Their red velvet pancakes are \"to die\" for! It's a small family-owned place with a very friendly staff. We did have to wait, but not for long. Although, the wait IS TOTALLY worth it! Also, the service is great! Wonderful people run this place and I feel so welcomed here. And the prices make this restaurant even better! The food is cheap, but does not taste it. I also love how they give proportion options - short & tall stack pancakes, and individual crepes. I HIGHLY recommend this place!!!!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could lol.  :)"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a regular here and come at least once a month. The food keeps me coming back and the waiters are friendly in the midst of the rush. My favorite items on the menu are the hazelnut, white chocolate, red velvet, and Cinnabon pancakes. I also have to get Portuguese sausage as a side every time. The only downfall of this place is the wait time. If you're in the mood for a quick breakfast, this is not the place. It's best to arrive early because the wait time is usually 30-45 minutes. They are expanding to a Centennial location, so that's good news! All in all, great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I just went to this location yesterday with my family. There were about 12 of us. The wait wasn't bad  at all. We were seated once all guests arrived. I ended up ordering the, \"build your own\", omelette; which comes with a short stack of pancakes (or toast) and potatoes. For all 12 people ordering, our food came out in a very timely manner. Everyone's plate looked great. Personally, my food was okay. I enjoyed the omelette (nothing special). But my pancakes tasted very bitter and like card board =\. For some reason, the plain ones are just not very appetizing. They were tough. I'd totally recommend ordering a specialty stack of pancakes . Those were flavorful and delicious (as I tried my husbands and friends red velvet and banana pudding cakes - very delicious) ."}
{"text":"Holy cow! It was an amazing breakfast! Loved the chocolate chip pancakes. They have a great staff with welcoming smiles!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The chocolate chip pancakes are to die for. We Got here around 10 AM on a Saturday. And was able to sit right down anything after that it started to get really crowded. It is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place and their red velvet pancakes and it did not disappoint. I ordered the adobo omelet and it was devoured by the whole family. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"SERVICE 4/5: 
This restaurant welcomed us with smiles. The servers were always attentive if we needed anything. Patient and fast.

FOOD 3/5:
PANCAKES = OUTRAGEOUSLY SWEET. I got the carrot pancakes and my boyfriend got the banana foster and it was so sweet that we only finished half our pancakes."}
{"text":"Wish I had the stomach to try every single pancake flavor! So amazing! 

Mandatory Vegas spot from now on!"}
{"text":"We have been to one of the Babystacks on Buffalo before and loved it. We plan on going back to that one should we go to Babystacks again. 
My boyfriend, son, and I came in for a late breakfast on Thursday. There were people there, but plenty of open tables. Once seated, we ordered drinks from the server while we looked over the menu. She asked if we were ready to order, but I wasn't and asked for another minute. She left and we did not see her again for at least 10 minutes. Fair enough though, I did ask for more time and that's what we got. 
We placed our order ; I got the Mexican skillet with bananas foster pancakes, my son ordered bacon and eggs with Rocky Road pancakes, the bf ordered a veggie omelette and strawberry pancakes. After another kinda long wait, out came my pancakes, my bf's pancakes and my son's bacon and eggs. Then another wait. It wasn't too bad for me. I ate half my pancakes before the rest of my food came to the table, but my boyfriend likes to eat his pancakes for \"dessert\". That's just the way the man eats. So my skillet finally comes, my son's pancakes come. The server says to my bf, \"your omelette will be out in a minute\". Fine. Well, she didn't come back with his food until my son and I were about done eating. She just sets it down with a, \"Sorry\". So he scarfed it down since he was starving and then ate his cold pancakes while we waited for him. 
My bf and I have both been servers before so we're pretty understanding of kitchen mishaps and we tend to tip generously, but the way she handled this was all wrong. She could have offered some form of explanation so he would know he should eat his pancakes instead of saying it will be out in a minute. She also should have offered a discount or something for the inconvenience of not bringing his food until we were done. So the 2 stars are strictly for the food which was very good. Service needs some work."}
{"text":"The experience I had here at babystacks was incredible. The amount of pancakes to choose from was insane and and was hard for me to make a decision. Not only were the toppings on the pancakes delicious the pancakes themselves were warm and fluffy while melting in your mouth. The service was great as well, the ladies there are all kind and professional. I ended up coming here two mornings in a row because I couldn't get enough. Make sure to get there early right when they open or later before they close to avoid the crowd. Will definetly be coming back here when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning, and while busy the wait was worth it.  Had to wait about 20 minutes, but once we got our table our waiter was super helpful and nice.  We went with the headliner: the red velvet pancakes.  Also got a set of regular pancakes and some chocolate chip as well.  

Food came fast and was really fantastic, the pancakes are rich and sweet without being over the top.  You definitely want to plan your flavors as some of the sweeter pancakes probably don't pair as well with the traditional salty elements like bacon and eggs, but still they are delicious.

No complaint about the food or service!"}
{"text":"BabyStacks has become a tradition on every Vegas trip. It's a ways from The Strip so don't think it's a quick stop but it's a definite must-try. The Cafe seems like it's Filipino, ergo Adobo Fried Rice, with American and Hawaiian influence.

Red Velvet Pancakes -- Fluffy red pancakes topped with chocolate chips and whipped cream. It's served with their absolutely delicious cream cheese syrup so you can flavor to taste. Typically, I get the pancakes without whipped cream. IMO, everything is perfectly sweet without it. The cream cheese syrup is to die for. It's a perfect pairing with the semi-sweet red velvet pancakes. 

Rick's Adobo Fried Rice -- Shredded chicken with rice wrapped inside an egg and green onions. Simply incredible. The saltiness of the chicken was just right. Add some hot sauce (Cholula or Sriracha) to give it a kick. It's a hearty portion but it's so dang good I usually finish most of it in one sitting. It also comes with a side of mac salad. You can hardly taste the mayo. Probably one of my favorite versions of mac salad to date. 

Service has always been on point. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"My buddy brought me here as a surprise he didn't know I tried to come here before and I didn't stay because of the wait. 

Man what a great surprise the food is good the coffee is good the price point ok. Really small place but nicely decorated. The wait staff is friendly and decent service. 

I had the red velvet pancakes and I have to say their signature dish is awesome! The cream cheese syrup with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles...I need to run a couple extra miles to balance this out.

Place has decent food and great red velvet pancakes. This is truly a treat place."}
{"text":"I can give this the best rating without even thinking about it.  I met a friend from Arizona at Babycakes this morning for a breakfast of Red Velvet pancakes.  We each got the short stack.  The three cakes come with a dollop of whipped cream and a container of liquid cream cheese.  I thought I detected a slight vanilla flavor in the cream cheese.  It was divine!  There was also a sprinkling of mini chocolate pieces that melted from the warmth of the pancakes!

I had coffee and my friend had Coke.  Service was wonderful!  Our server had a great smile and was right on top of everything.  I had a coffee refill almost before I knew I wanted one.

I will be back to try some other items on the menu.  Being able to go on weekdays lessens the worry about waiting although we met at 8:30 and the place was almost filled - it is small - before 9."}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the amazing reviews. I was HIGHLY Disappointed .. First I ordered bacon and eggs ; eggs, scrambled with h cheese. The bacon was half cooked ( I guess u need to ask for crispy bacon to get it fully cooked). I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese, and I got chopped eggs with a slice of cheese on top. Excuse me but I believe when you ask for scramble eggs with cheeses, it suppose to come out SCRAMBLED with CHEESE in it smh. My friend ordered corn beef hash with potatoes on thee side, and her potatoes was frozen in the inside. 

With the negative comes the positive and the ONLY positive I can say is .. 
I ordered the cinnamon bun pancakes and I would have to say it's was the best thing out of the whole order.

I will not be going back to baby stacks. The reviews really let me down this time"}
{"text":"A friend from Canada emailed and wanted to know if we could meet somewhere for breakfast.  She had some shopping she wanted to do today and asked what places I'd suggest.  I sent her a few Yelp links and she picked BabyStacks Café.  I have smart friends!

We met just before 8 this morning.  I have eaten at the other location where I had the red velvet pancakes.  I had studied the menu several times before going and changed my mind as I was ordering.  I got a short stack of the Rocky Road pancakes.  The menu describes it this way:  \"Almonds and marshmallow in chocolate batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, more almonds and marshmallows.  Lightly drizzled with chocolate syrup and cocoa powder.\"

How's that for having dessert for breakfast?  The cakes were excellent!  Very flavorful with lots of good chocolate flavor and the sliced almonds added some nice texture.  Our coffee was refilled quickly.

This was a great place to meet a good friend, have some good conversation, and enjoy some tasty pancakes for breakfast.  There are so many other things on the menu you try, that I'll have to return!"}
{"text":"Came in with my husband, 4 kids & the grandbaby. The wait wasn't bad. The service was quick & the food was just as quick. not one complaint out of the kids' mouths,  they were too busy shoveling the food in. I personally had the fried rice adobo omelet, which I would order again.  We're from out of town, found it on Yelp, & as confirmed with local family we would not be let down. Definitely was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed about their rice. For a place that serves \"hawaiian\" style food, their rice was like \"minute / jasmine\" rice. 
I wish I had asked our busser (since he looked like he could've been from Hawaii) if he would've eaten the rice. I'm positive he would've said 'NO'. Al dente, hard on the exterior like its been sitting out too long and not appetizing at all. 
Get potatoes. You're better off. 
As for the rest of the food, I had a spam scramble - not enough furikake. Pancakes were good and fluffy. 
Please just fix the rice!!! Trust me it's gross."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service. Good prices. Hard for me to recommend places so highly, but I have got to say we will swing in here anytime we come visit the in laws."}
{"text":"DONT MISS OUT ON THEIR PANCAKES!! 

My boyfriend and I shared a short stack (3 pancakes) of red velvet pancakes and OH MAN, it's f- delicious. The pancake itself is not overly sweet or thick at all, has amazing flavor (really tastes like red velvet, and has incredible delicious whipped cream with the most satisfying chocolate shavings that's  sprinkled on top. SO GOOD!! 

I also ordered the Kuala Pig Eggs Benedict with hash browns, but i just thought it was just okay. There wasn't really much flavor than I have expected. 
My boyfriend got their Kuala Pig Grilled Cheese with hasbrowns and it was okay as well imo. Just a regular grilled cheese with Kuala Pig. 

But yeah, overall definitely stick to the pancakes because it's soo delicious!!"}
{"text":"After hiking at Mount Charleston with Terri R. and Mel C., we decided to stop here for breakfast.  I didn't know there was a northwest outlet for Babystacks.  It proved to be a good place to go.

I have never had Spam until today.  When I looked at their menu and saw the Specialties section, the Spam Scramble popped out and I knew I had to order this.  Along with this, I opted for the two pancakes you can get instead of toast.  I ordered the Orange Creamsicle pancakes that come with orange syrup, whipped cream, and a small container of cream cheese icing.

Breakfast was great!  Spam is just like cubed lunch meat.  The Furikake mixed in gave the scramble some extra taste and the rice was good.  I didn't finish the rice because I wanted to have the healthier food--the pancakes with orange syrup and whipped cream.

As others have mentioned, this is a large restaurant and they have a large waiting area.  The three of us opted to eat at the counter where there was immediate seating.  Service was great.  My coffee was refilled several times and they were there to refill water glasses, too.

This is a good option for my hiking group to stop for a late breakfast/lunch while we're still hiking at Charleston.  

This was a tasty breakfast made better because I enjoyed it with two friends."}
{"text":"I came here super hungry at around 2pm without eating anything prior to coming. If you know me then you know that I expect a couple things under these conditions:  a) some damn good food b) a lot of it c) food has to live up to the yelp hype since I researched the shit out of this place.

I walked away a little disappointed for the following reasons:

1) small portions
2) waited 20 minutes for a table at 2pm (popular place, i get it)
3) mediocre quality
4) I really wanted to like this place based on the reviews!

Here's what we ordered:

Kahlua pork grilled cheese (2/5) - bland and sandwich wasn't thick, very thin and unsatisfying

spam and eggs w/garlic rice (3/5) - while this was good (its very hard to screw up spam and eggs), the ratio of garlic rice to spam/eggs was low on the rice side. I asked if I could get more rice since there wasn't much of it and the waitress replied that to get a side of white rice it would be another $3. REALLY? That's ridic. I didn't eat all my spam for this reason...

red velvet pancakes(5/5) - very good, as expected since this is what everyone raves about. I did enjoy this but not enough to make up for the main breakfast dishes.

If you like pancakes for breakfast then come here otherwise i think other breakfast joints would serve you better."}
{"text":"3 times, very good and simple. I had my usual corned hash beef with buttermilk pancake. Delish!!"}
{"text":"Fun breakfast spot.  Staff is cool, nice menu, competetive prices, quality offerings.  Inside only."}
{"text":"Worse! Food! EVER!!!! The wait staff is ok but the food is probably the worst food I've had since living in Vegas. I tried giving them a \"second\" chance at another location but I was still disappointed! (My entire party was disappointed) someone even asked \"whoever recommended this place can not choose breakfast for a loooong time for choosing this place!!!!!!\" Go if you've been starving other than that there's IHOP or even McDonald's is better!"}
{"text":"Came in and had the loco moco plate,  and the red velvet pancakes. I have to say presentation wasn't a concern of theirs,  but the loco moco was perfect! I never had it with onions, the sauce was just right in flavor. The portion was just enough. Now the velvet pancakes?  A little bit too much on salt, it was almost as if I were eating my play dough again lol! If they just need to cut down on salt, and it will be perfect. Staff was friendly, service was good. I will return to try something different."}

Overall: 
Red velvet pancake,  daughter ordered it was surprisingly good.  It tasted fairly close to an actual red velvet cupcake.  I hate pancakes but this one it was good.  However wish they had a smaller stack bc we couldn't finish it.  It's not a meal, it's more of sharing with everyone for couple bites and your good.  

Galbi with garlic rice, oh the rice was good. It didn't have too much flavor but it was good. Reminded me of Hawaii.


If you thought it was helpful, please hit those buttons [helpful, funny, cool or send me a compliment ]  Thank you and happy eating!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food EVER!!
Hawaiians know how to eat.
Just don't think about calories and you'll be fine!

Adobo fried rice is to die for! So good, eat that shiii with sriracha with breakfast potatoes, they are amazing! 

The sliders are delish! The Kalua Benedict, hellllllo foodgasm. 

Oh if you don't want to jizz your pants in public or drool all over don't buy the pancakes. If you don't give a flying ffffff, get it, because if you die tomorrow after eating these delicious little monsters, you'd die happy and fulfilled.

The servers are allll nice, they treat you like family.

Service is good, food is great, price is reasonable, portions are huge... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This place has become a regular breakfast stop for me!   Erica and the team are all amazing!   Sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"the red velvet pancake were so so yummy, hubs had the bacon pancakes and said they were good also. I left wanting to try at least 5 more flavors even though I was so full. 
Go here but expect a wait we went on a Saturday and it was 45mins we left and came back on a Monday around 9:30 and waited 25 mins."}
{"text":"Being a creature of habit, I've spent too much time at Egg Works over the past few months. It's my, seemingly fail proof, go to breakfast spot. I wanted to switch things up and so I gave BabyStacks a shot. Definitely not disappointed. 

This location was a fairly small little spot, but the wait wasn't terrible. Like many diners, people get in and out at a good pace. I spent most of the wait with neck breaking turns left and right to stare down people's food as it came to the tables. 

I ended up choosing Rick's Adobo Fried Rice and just loved it. A good amount of food at a reasonable price and I can see why it is considered to be one of the \"local's favorites.\" 

Also had a chance to taste the Cinnabun pancakes. If you're not concerned about your blood sugar levels, then get after this. The short stack (which will set you back all of $5 and some change) comes with 3 pancakes and trust me when I say you better be famished if you think you're going to finish a full order.  

So many other items on the menu I'm looking forward to trying. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been to the other locations and neither one of them were this dirty. We waited for approximately 30 minutes before we were seated. The table we were seated at was not wiped down as there were still fresh water rings on the table.  My daughter found a piece of hair inside the napkin with the utensils. I asked for new utensils, this time, when my daughter opened the napkin, there was a piece of rice stuck in between the tines of the fork.  We were so grossed out. I ended asking for plastic utensils instead.... by the time our food arrived, my daughter already lost her appetite. In fairness,  the waiter was really nice,  that's the only reason why I'm giving them 1 star."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! it was busy and service was still excellent. I had the country benedict WOW definitely try it if you love biscuits and gravy and poached eggs."}
{"text":"On Thanksgiving morning, my husband and I wanted to enjoy a nice quiet meal before joining his family this afternoon for the Thxgvn festivities. As an out of towner, we relied on Yelp to find a decent breakfast place and avoid the typical gross joints such as IHOP or Denny's.  With limited holiday option, we decided to check out BabyStacks Cafe.

I been to the first location years ago and was pleased with it. I pleased to see they have done well to open a 2nd location.  Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and was seated immediately. This location certainly has more space, but it does not have the same 50's style I recall the first location had.  The menu is about the same and I noticed they are offering more \"Hawaiian\" style breakfast which I didn't remember they've had before.  No matter, they still have their famous pancakes.

My husband an I ordered the whole wheat french toast coated with corn flakes cereal.  My husband went with a BYO omelette with a side of Oreo cookie pancake.  When our order arrived, my french toast looked amazing.  They were so thick I decided it's best to eat it using my hand like a french toast bar.  However, my husbands BYO omelette looked less than appealing to me.  The side of hash browns looked dry as if it came out of a frozen package hashbrown.  The omelette is just uninteresting. The Oreo cookie pancake came shortly.  My husband thought it was ok.  It was essentially a chocolate cake not even a pancake with whipped cream; well....not a total lost, the whipped cream was tasty.   My French toast was really good. I also ordered a side of Portuguese sausage so I have a sweet and spicy combination.  It was a good call; the combination was very good.

Overall, I think the place is ok.  I think there are other places that offer a more well rounded offerings here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a must every time we come to Vegas. The food is always delicious. The wait staff is very attentive and the prices are very reasonable. 

They have a myriad of pancake flavors. I love the red velvet cake and the lemon one. 

Trust me, you need to go here, just do it! (Nike)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every time we go to Vegas, we make sure to hit this place up at least once for breakfast. 

There is a huge selection of specialty pancakes, my favorite is the red velvet with the cream cheese frosting. 

I give their omelets a B+, they are big and they don't skimp on the fillings. 

If you are in Vegas, do yourself a huge favor and check it out. The wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! There's usually a line but the food is worth the wait. The red velvet pancakes are the best thing on the menu. This is my new favorite breakfast spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience here.  Love the non traditional breakfast items. Portuguese sausage and garlic rice is awesome!! My wife had tried a different style pancake each time. .. She is never disappointed.  Highly recommend this place.!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! The Bananas Foster pancakes are amazing. 

The service however is what made 5 stars 3. Painfully slow and we went during non-rush hour.  The waiting area was packed with several empty tables waiting to be filled. The front counter staff focused more on answering the phone and taking to go/pick up orders rather than the waiting on customers."}
{"text":"I ordered the carrot cake pancakes & a sweet cream crepe with strawberries.  I could legitimately eat this breakfast every day!  It was out of this world delicious!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot. There are two locations and  I have been to both. Love the red velvet pancakes. Try the Hawaiian pork eggs Benedict. There is always a wait on the weekends and holidays. Only downside can be the kids that run around or scream who are ignored by inattentive parents and staff who don't address it. Yes, this happens regularly."}
{"text":"Pancakes-decent.
Service- No, just no.
Wait time- Not worth it...
 The first time I came here I was blown away by the Red Velvet Pancakes.
The second time I came here, I realized this place wasn't as amazing  as I originally thought, and considered it decent. 
After that, I tried to steer clear from here, but of course everytime someone wants to have brunch- they and their neighbors always want to meet up here, so I go, but not by choice.
Like I said- their food is decent, but the wait time is annoyingly long, and not worth  it for the service you get. Even after waiting 45 minutes for a table, the server took 10 minutes to take our order. She came back missing 4 out of 8 drinks, and gave us the wrong 4 when she came back...ok, maybe she was new or having a bad day, but with 3 servers and not that many tables, someone should've helped her out. Another 30 minutes later (no exaggeration here, I promise) she came out with our food. 
But wait-
The cream cheese syrup is what MAKES the Red Velvet Pancakes decent...no cream cheese syrup?! Guess what happens next? Oh right, I wait...AGAIN, this time for a HALF filled syrup cup!!! I ask, nicely, maybe she'll fill it up a little bit, since it's half full and I server says ,\"it'll be another 75 cents extra.\"
Okay- in my defense, I read that it would be extra for the syrup, but I just wanted her to fill up the syrup cup included with my pan-cakes-puh-lease!!!
 
What in the hell?!?!? 
I would've given this place 3 stars if it weren't for the extra hour and a half used in waiting for seating and food...and the syrup!!!"}
{"text":"If you want an awesome breakfast experience that will delight you in the morning and make you feel happy for the rest of the day - then eat here!  BUT, you must either come really early to ensure you are not waiting in line too long, or come an hour and a half before it closes (considered lunch time - or Brinner if you will) so that the wait isn't as long as in the morning.  

I ordered the Adobo fried rice.  It comes wrapped up in an egg omelete.  A little much egg for me, but the adobo fried rice itself was really good!  In fact, my mouth is watering as I'm typing this out.  That's how good it is!

Then I ordered a short stack of the Peanut Butter and Jelly pancakes with banana.  Best pancakes I have ever had.  I loved it!

You have to come here and order both an entree and another entree just for the pancakes.  You will not regret the calorie intake!

The people I came with had the corn beef hash, the portoguese sausage and eggs, and of course the infamous red velvet pancakes.  The full stack is huge!  They both very much enjoyed their meal as well.

I HIGHLY recommend this place.  It's so good!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened up this new location much closer to the Southwest Las Vegas area.

I love to order the Portugeuse sausage with garlic fried rice with my pancakes side upgraded to the Peanut Butter and banana pancakes.

Yum!  This place never fails me.  This new spot is even better and bigger, and a much shorter wait.  I will definitely start to frequent this joint.

My friends love the red velvet pancakes too, and the loco moco.  Other friends have said they liked the Adobo Fried Rice too.

Try it now!  Breakfast or Brunch, it's good!

Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (44/365). I have a lot of catching up to do"}
{"text":"About 15 minute drive from the strip. 
it was a full house during breakfast/brunch time (weekend).  Be prepared to wait. 
When we left at about 2pm - there was no wait. 

Tip:  Look at menu & also the specials on the board while waiting. Then when you're seated..BAM - you're ready to order. Efficiency! Time is of the essence in Vegas :)

                                          THE SCOOP:

KAHLUA PORK EGGS BENEDICT:  pork was tender and seasoned well.  Not too salty, which is a PLUS in my book.  I asked for hollandaise sauce ON THE SIDE.  You might want to request this too.  B/c once you break the egg yolk it can get pretty rich & heavy.  And if your benedict is drenched in hollandaise sauce too...idk!  Can you say heartburn?  This dish was pretty good. 

PORTUGUESE SAUSAGE w/ garlic rice & eggs PLUS your choice pancakes (2 cakes).  This dish is simple, but AWESOME. The garlic rice is good & homey, but NOT ENOUGH (portion size is about 1/2 bowl of rice).  Us Asians like our rice. 
Sausage was tasty and plenty. 
As for the pancake - i ordered Banana cream Pie.  A bit bland and dull for me.  Like all some of the other reviews say - if you like Banana cream pie...you would like this. However, it was BLAH.  I even ordered CREAM CHEESE syrup on the side.  The syrup wasn't as good as I envisioned it to be.  Tasted more like a sugar glaze w/ a hint of cream cheese.  

ADOBO FRIED RICE: Egg omlette w/ pork adobo rice inside. Sounded pretty unique...had to get it (to go).  It was good, but nothing too special.  Meat was tender and well marinated. i would go w/ the Portuguese sausage combo dish rather than this. 

SERVICE: friendly waiter.  Food took a LONG time to come out. 

Overall, I liked the food and the wide selection on the menu.  I LOVE the idea of  Hawaiian/Filipino mixed with american breakfast.  What a great FUSION CONCEPT :)"}
{"text":"Centennial Hills location. Sparse menu, lackluster food.  Very disappointed after great hype. Might as well go to Centennial IHOP.  Once was enough. Too bad."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for brunch after a night out and I was starving! They have a lot of specialty pancake options which can be added to any of the combos as an upgrade. I stuck with the buttermilk but my friends got carrot cake and lemon meringue which they enjoyed. I also had an omelette which I didn't find to be amazing. It was a little overlooked so the edges were slightly burned and they didn't use a lot of cheese so it was on the dry side. We came on a weekday morning so it wasn't very crowded and our service was quick. Overall, a decent breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Not much of a fan...  The food is okay.  Not much to rave about...  I've been here twice and every time I've been here,  the wait for the food after you order is sooooooo long.  

1 thing I don't recommend on getting is their  blueberry pancakes.  It's dry and they give you nasty cardboard like blueberries on the side.  

1 thing I do recommend are their seasoned potatoes...  They actually cook them well. They are crunchy and tasty.  

Not my most favorite place to go,  but not the most hated either."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place has four locations and still allowed to be in business. It's only technicality but I would like to get what I ordered and paid for. 
First time this place opened some of the food they served wasn't even seasoned or ready to be served. Please thaw your frozen food properly before putting them in customers takeout. 

Second time only reason I had to order from here was so I don't have to drive 25 mins to get the stuff to make my own at home. Let me tell you something put the takeout items in a bag so your customer can take it not placing aplastic bag in front me to put the food in the bag after paying for it. You staff was watching put my food in my own bag and didn't do anything. This is so petty but so important. 

Food is isn't amazing it is mediocre and overpriced food that I wouldn't eat unless I have no choice. 


 It gets worst every time"}
{"text":"Three words...Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!

Resembling a stack of thinly layered crepe-like lemony yumminess these giant pancakes will leave you more than satisfied. if you're a lemon lover like me, these will not disappoint.  Served with a lemon wedge, powdered sugar and some lemony syrup.  Ohhhhhhh!  I will be back for more.  I had to take half of them home. So good!

We came early and beat the crowds. Thankfully they're opening another one in Centennial and another just opened down the street so that may alleviate the long wait for a table. Mr. G had the eggs and garlic rice and let me just say if you want to ward off the vampires...

Service was fabulous, friendly and attentive.  I'm glad I came back and gave them another try."}
{"text":"Babystacks Cafe, located in the Buffalo and Smoke Ranch area is superb.  I would give it 5 stars but on some days I'm fighting with flies to eat my food.

You can order pretty much anything and what you read on the menu is what you'll be served with.  I enjoyed everything I have ordered so far and if I were to order an omelet dish I would get a special short stack than the plain ones for an extra small fee.  I find it funny how an infused Filipino dish get mixed in next to items like the Red Velvet Pancakes.  But they work.

They have TVs in there but if you see a line outside please be courteous and get moving.  We want yummies in our stomach too!"}
{"text":"Went to this place after reading it was great thanks yelpers it was.  My boys had the red velvet pancakes and in short imagine a personal cake for breakfast some of the best pancakes I tasted and even better cold leftovers.  I had the biscuits and gravy not the best I ever had but not to far from the best.  Defenitely had a homemade feel all around.  Looking forward to going back and trying seething else from there

I went back before I rememberd to finish this and got the kalua pig eggs benedict awesome stuff my new breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Are you of Filipino or Asian descent....and you want some pancakes? Well then, Babycakes Cafe is for you!  The owners of Babycakes are some mighty nice PILIPINO (I say it like my nanay) people!  Have you eaten yet?

Babycakes is packed in the morning especially on weekends because they are only open for breakfast and lunch up until around 2 PM!  So if you can get over your \"What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas\" hangover get here early!  If you get to Babycakes at prime dining time be prepared for a bit of a wait.  But it's ok because it's worth it.

We meandered here on a Furlough Friday for us and intended not to spend any money of this day of no pay.  Boy was that a mistake!  We 'accidentally' pulled into the parking lot just to see what the crowd was like.  Once that smell of pancakes and grilled goodies hit me I couldn't help it.  We got out of the car and walked in.  Thankfully, no wait!

I just couldn't keep myself from looking around the dining area and checking to see if I was related to anyone in the place!  So bad...I know!  So many Asian people around me...like I was at a Wow-Wow-Wee taping!  Or a Journey concert with Alan Pineda as the lead singer!  Alas, there was no relatives of mine within the vicinity.

On to checking out the Babycakes Cafe menu.  Lots of familiar breakfast choices.  Babycake pancakes, favorites, omelettes, benedicts, crepes, all kinds of good stuff!  We ended up ordering the Baby Chick omelette with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and cheddar cheese ($9.50), the Two-Egg Breakfast with two eggs, and hashbrowns ($6.25), and a short stack of their famous Red Velvet babycakes ($5.75).  Both of our orders each also came with two buttermilk babycakes included!  Not too shabby!  

The food?  Delicious!  The omelette was fluffy and had a good amount of fillings, the eggs were cooked great (sunny side up..yum) and my hashbrowns were the way I like em'...super crunchy!  The babycakes were excellent as well, buttery and light.  But damn...those Red Velvet babycakes?  They were pretty bomb!  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips?  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  So savory!  Didn't even need the cream cheese syrup.  I will be sure to order a FULL stack of these next time!  And probably not share, ha ha!

Babycakes Cafe also has some stuff on the menu that is definitely Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian inspired.  These guys serve Spam!  Oh yeah!  The king of meats in Hawaii!  Definitely feelin' like I'm home.  Babycakes also has a Kalua Pig Benedict which definitely rings in the islands.  Don't forget Loco Moco!  It's made there too.  They serve Asian inspired Honey Toast!  Japan would be proud!  One of Babycakes biggest specialty sellers is Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  I wish I had ordered it because it looked so yummy!  Steaming hot with a side of macaroni salad included, all I needed was to top it off with ketchup, shoyu, and Tabasco.  Breakfast nirvana I say!

We'll be going here again soon.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere is good.  I heard on the grapevine that the members of Jabbawockeez and Super Cr3w frequent Babycakes Cafe quite a bit and they love it!  I didn't see any of them in there the time we visited...but then again, how would I know what the Jabbawockeez guys look like without their white masks on?

Go here for a good breakfast!  It's the most important meal of the day!  If I remember correctly, the lady owner of Babycakes Cafe was super duper, mighty fine lookin', very pretty lady!  Friendly too.  Another reason to visit sooner!"}
{"text":"Funny enough, we live right smack in between both Babystacks Café places.  We finally decided to take the jaunt in the opposite direction and visit the location on N. Durango!

Place is super busy for breakfast on the weekends.  Especially on a Sunday.  So church goers beware.  You may be in for a bit of a wait in your Sunday best.  Luckily for the wifey and I the wait was only about 10 minutes that day.

Place is nice and lively, and seems a bit more spacious than the other location on Buffalo.  Actually it seems a lot more spacious with the high ceilings and more tables.  I like the colors, actually makes me want to drink coffee and eat breakfast.

Menu here is just about the same as the other location.  Breakfast and lunch items galore!  Nothing in short supply.  I skipped my want of Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (hard for a Filipino) and went with something else out of the menu.

I chose the Ranchero Omelette ($9.25) - four egg omelette with an entire Ortega chile and chicken, topped with fresh green salsa, and pepper jack and cheddar cheese.  Also came with hash browns (love mine well done), and two buttermilk babystack pancakes (of course!).  Omelette was of good size, with lots of chile and chopped chicken on the inside.  The cheeses complimented the omelette well, and the green salsa gave it a nice added kick (but not too hot).  I enjoyed it a lot.  The hash browns were standard, good and cooked how I like.  I however love to drown mine in pepper, ketchup, and lots of Tabasco.  Yum.  The babystack pancakes?  Good to the last bite.  I dunno what it is about their babystack batter, but it's a keeper.  Nice, hot, fluffy (not you Gabriel Iglesias), not doughy or rubbery, perfect with some maple syrup.  All in all a great breakfast for me.

The wifey had the Mexican Skillet ($9.95) - flat top potatoes with marinated carnitas and jalapenos, with pepper jack cheese, topped with two eggs over-easy, and a side of fresh pico de gallo, and sour cream.  Wifey also opted for two buttermilk babystack pancakes.  She said her dish was good, but there was a bit too much jalapeno in her skillet making it a little spicy for her liking.  The pico de gallo also had more onion than tomato.  Other than that she enjoyed it, and gave thumbs up to the babystack pancakes.

I like Babystacks Café for breakfast and will keep coming here for their morning delights.  Service here is great, our server was quick, very attentive, and kept our cups full.  Can't ask for anything more, especially during the early morning rush.

Eat!  Next time it will be Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  Or maybe not."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes? Yes please! This is a diet-busting, calorie nightmare and was super sweet, but I LOVED it. I finally get what all the fuss is about. Because of the sugar overload, I can't make this an every day or even every week stop, but definitely a place to keep in my back pocket for a treat! Prices were reasonable, the place was clean, and the server was nice. No complaints and nearly gave it 5 stars. Just not quite there. Almost....almost."}
{"text":"Wish they had locations in Southern California, Southbay area!  Look forward to eating here everytime we visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived we were a bit concerned because at 8:30am no cars were out front. But we decided to check it out anyway and glad we did. Always nice to get away from the strip and check out a locals place. 

There were many tasty sounding options and it took me a while to decide! It's cool to be able to order a skillet or omelet and have the side as a specialty pancake option. 

I chose the Piglet skillet: crunchy potatoes, good melted cheddar, eggs cooked as ordered, sausage, ham, and bacon. Pancake choice was rocky road short stack, which I didn't love (but it was still good) because the chocolate overpowered the almonds and marshmallows. 

The coffee was a basic weaker brew and the tea only green or black. So for a breakfast place, found myself wishing for better hot drink choices. 

Good friendly service was appreciated. 

The bathrooms are a bit grimy. 

Overall would try again because several pancake choices caught my eye and I would like to give them a try."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars

How can one place be soo good and soo bad?

Cons: The coffee is like hot water. If you closed your eyes, you couldn't tell the difference.  Furthermore, no lattes, cappucino or espresso! BOO!
Our eggs were so overcooked they were essentially hard boiled.  For a breakfast place, screwing up the eggs and coffee is sort of a big deal!

Pros:The hollandaise sauce is dreamy.  The kahlua pig benedict was excellent except for the above mentioned eggs.  The prices are fair. $50 for 4 breakfasts and 4 coffees. The red velvet pancakes were excellent and surprisingly not too sweet.

We also ordered a huntington omelette, and spinach benedict.  Omelette was o.k. Nothing special; on the dry side. Eggs were overcooked on this benedict as well.  

Service was o.k. We had to flag her down to take our order but she did keep our coffee full without asking. We waited 30 mins. to be seated at 10:30 on a Friday morning.  

I'm willing to try them again but right now not so impressed."}
{"text":"This place is popping! Service was a bit slow but understandable considering how busy they were. The red velvet pancakes are a must have. Will be coming back to try their other pancakes."}
{"text":"Holy moly supper yummy.  The pancakes are always amazing, lunch is tasty. The only negative is when I order a house salad before my meal... It never comes out first.  Like 5 times now."}
{"text":"If I can give this place zero stars I would . So I came in 3/10/18 @ 9:50 am and we got sat at 11:15 am with a party of 7 Everyone who came after us was sat before us . We asked the hostess twice for an update of when we would be sat, and both of them were VERY RUDE.  And then when we finally get sat they seat us at a table for 6 so we asked if we can get another chair and they said no because it's a fire hazard which is understandable, but they should have just waited till they had enough seats/tables available before seating us, so here we are squeezing 7 people in a tiny ass table. And the server clearly did not know her menu but she was nice.. food was okay , iv had better at another location."}
{"text":"Came here after a day of hard drinking and waking up not knowing what today it was with a hangover lol. Place was packed but the wait wasn't as long as I expected I was looking up food thruYELP and I already fell in love with this place! Adobe fried rice and the variety of pancakes is delicious this place is truly amazing! RECOMMEND ON COMING HERE EVERYDAY FOR BREAKFAST!!!! I'll be back here for sure when I visit Vegas and will have pictures next time!"}
{"text":"All their pancakes are awesome and the kalua pig/grilled cheese sandwich is bomb too!"}
{"text":"We went early today ( Saturday) knowing that the wait is usually long. We waited about 20 minutes, not too bad but we won't be coming here any time soon on our own volition.

 I ordered the Huntington Omelette-  the omelette kinda sucked- the avocado on top was not ripe and the cheese had no flavor. The hash browns which we ordered extra crispy were only half cooked (hate to see how they would have been otherwise).   I did not bother to take more than 4 or 5 bites. I did order the Red Velvet Pancakes-  they deserved 4 stars! They were very good.   

My husband ordered  the corned beef hash which he said  was \"nothing to write about.  He thought it tasted very bland & almost canned although the menu states it was home made.  He was also disappointed in the hash browns.  He ordered the Smores pancakes.  He liked them-I found them way too sweet.
.  
Service was quick and our server was pleasant."}
{"text":"Let me start of with the red velvet pancakes! It's a must try when you come to Babystacks Cafe they are so delicious!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast before we headed home. Small wait time for a table. Glad we got there when we did. Place really filled up as we sat and ate. Food took a good bit to come out. Worth the wait. Everything was fresh and delicious! Red Velvet Pancakes are a MUST!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, and options for vegans. (No vegan menu but they made it work.) I was a happy camper! My bf loved the corned beef hash and pancakes. Definitely reasonable prices:) we will be back!"}
{"text":"The green chili sauce is simply amazing. Both locations are awesome. Always clean. Great staff. I eat there a few times per month. If I didn't work so much I would eat there daily. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I went here with my cousin after she picked me up from the airport. She recommended it to me, as it is the original BabyStacks Cafe in Las Vegas.

I ordered their Banana Cream Pie pancakes and the Hawaiian-like combo order, which I don't remember the name of, that consisted of Spam, eggs cooked to order (I got my usual scrambled), white garlic rice and furikake (rice seasoning of Japan). The breakfast definitely reminded me of what I typically eat for breakfast, as I really love Spam! Spam was good, although I should have asked to have them cooked longer to brown them - my Spam was just cooked and hot (which isn't particularly bad). The rice could have been made better as it was more moist than I usually have white rice. The pancakes were really good, but the bananas weren't as fresh - soggy, brown was how they were presented to me. I think that the pancakes were definitely sweet enough to go with the banana cream pie part and didn't require any syrup of any kind.

I also tried my cousin's red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. It was VERY red in color (I don't think they should put that much color in there), but it turned out to taste really well and not have an artificial taste. Usually with a bright color, I associate that with artificial taste, but this was not the case for the pancakes.

Overall, I would definitely come back here again, so I can try all the other flavors of pancakes they have! The price per person was definitely matching the quality and portion of food! I recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas, or any locals!"}
{"text":"Kaylah was wonderful here at baby stacks! Such quick and friendly service, with a welcoming smile! I'll deffitently be back. Thanks Josh for recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"Love their food. Service is sometimes slow, but they are very friendly and worth the wait. I have not had something that I have not liked. I wish they would let you substitute some of their crepes, though."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie the food is beyond amazing, the two separate times I come on vacation I come here and order the kalbi with rice and every time without any exaggeration, we find hair inside. 

I really don't want to give this rating for such a great food spot. But how can it be such a coincidence that I come order the same dish between different months that we can possibly find hairs in the food. 

The first occasion when we found the hair we spoke to the manager and he switched the dish for us, the second time they just apologized and offered a free small stack. It's quite unfortunate that it happened twice but that's more than enough for me not to come back. Hygiene is very important in a restaurant and if the chef isn't covering up then it'll always be an issue."}
{"text":"This place is that good that we had to come here TWICE during our week stay in Vegas.  I do believe that they have ties to Hawaii (which is always nice, being from the 808 myself) because their menu offers items similar to what's offered back in Hawaii.  

I highly recommend their \"Huntington\" omelette upgrading your sides with their \"Cinnabun\" pancakes.  SO GOOOOD!  Will be back again for more, thanks gang!"}
{"text":"Come here for the pancakes! My family and I come here often for their wide variety of pancakes. 

Babystacks is a Breakfast/Brunch place that specializes in Hawaiian style dishes, such as the Loco Moco, Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, etc. However, they also have normal breakfast plates such as Eggs Benedict, Chicken Fried Steak, Biscuits & Gravy, etc. This place is pretty well known for their pancakes, especially their Red Velvet! They have a ton of choices to choose from that are pretty delicious and awesome.

Here are the dishes we have tried:

Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict - Not a fan. The Kalua Pig was burnt and didn't really go well with the Hollandaise Sauce.

Adobo Fried Rice - This was okay. There didn't seem to be a good amount of meat to rice ratio inside the omelette. 

Eggs Benedict - Delicious! Eggs were poached perfectly, and their Hollandaise Sauce was spot on.

Chicken Fried Steak - My hubby's go-to dish! Good portion of chicken fried steak, delicious white gravy, and potatoes. Yum! 

Loco Moco - This is a hit or miss. Sometimes the hamburger patty is good and moist, while other times (like today) it's dry and tough. 

Red Velvet Pancakes - These pancakes are good, but our family prefers their other ones.

Lemon Ricotta - When I want something light and not as heavy and decadent as normal pancakes, I get these. They are really light, but definitely delicious.

Smores Pancakes - My son's favorite Pancakes! Chocolate chip pancakes, with chocolate drizzle, crushed graham crackers and marshmallows? So Good!

What I love about this place is the fact that I can get a normal meal, and then opt to get pancakes instead of toast/rice/potatoes for $1.50 more. Their pancakes are like a dessert for us, so it's nice to end our meals off with their pancakes instead of having to order a whole plate of them.

-1 Star for their inconsistent food/service at times."}
{"text":"Food wasn't satisfying,music was loud,too many kids in there,sits were uncomfortable,overall,I didn't like the place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday around noon. Wait was approximately 30 minutes. Ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs with the buttermilk pancakes. Service was four out of five stars. Didn't have to wait too long to request condiments. Prices were fair. Portion sizes are also pretty good. Food was a bit under seasoned but that was easily remedied.

Overall I would return on another trip and perhaps try a different breakfast choice"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast during the weekday. Always busy and food is amazing. Small place though, need more room. Kinda pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  So glad to have one closer to home, went there this morning for breakfast. Service was fast and as always great. I had the piglet skillet and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes (which are to die for). Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I didn't.

I heard a lot about their pancakes, so I decided I must try some!

I ordered with my sister, brother in lw, and my baby niece. They were very accommodating with the baby.

I see how people can be turned off by the real wait time versus the posted wait time. Our 20 minute wait was only about 10 minutes. Someone was told 30 and they left when they only would have waited 15.

I was leaning towards 3 stars, but the service and speediness of our food made it a 4.

I thought the place was very cute and their staff was very nice.

Our male waiter was especially awesome, checking up on us and coming around at the perfect times, even though the place was packed. 

Now for the food..

The orange juice was definitely not fresh, but it's cool. They'd have to keep a bunch of oranges.

I ordered the carrot cake pancakes and the pork adobo fried rice.

My sister got the same entree as me and her fiancé got the kalua pork eggs Benedict.

The bro in law thought his food was really good, which is what I'll probably order if I return.

The sister and I agreed the pork adobo fried rice was underwhelming.

The dish was just flat in my opinion; barely seasoned, unseasoned egg, and just lacking flavor. I only ate half, and I usually always finish my food :]

My carrot cake pancakes were awesome! It had actual carrot in it and pecans on top. The cream cheese syrup was really good! I appreciate the portion of syrup, although small, because you get to taste the actual pancake itself instead of sugary syrup.

About everything was under 10 bucks that I saw. 

I'd definitely go back for more pancakes, but their \"specialty\" entree of adobo fried rice should have been more of a standout.

Oh yea! We needed hot water and cold water to mix with baby formula and the waiter came through."}
{"text":"Fast service, good food, short wait, nice server. I got the honey toast and I literally wanted to screen shot my tongue just to remember how flippin good it was. M'lady got ye mocha chip pancakes which were like chocolate chip pancakes except hipster. I never got the the bottom of my coffee cup for more than 30 seconds."}
{"text":"I REEEEAAAALLLYYYY enjoyed my breakfast here. I found the place on Yelp a month ago & as soon as I got to town I had to try them out! 

The place is small and cozy. I opted to see at the island and save the tables for patrons with othet guests since I was dining in alone while waiting to pick up a relative from the airport. 

I ordered the German chocolate short order of pancakes & the Portuguese sausage cooked well done. THEY PREPARED EVERYTHING PERFECT!!!!! I'm not a breakfast snob & rarely have to have it, but when I do crave it, I'm ecstatic when they don't disappoint. 

Service was just ok. I wasn't wowed. I wasn't pissed off, but it was just ok. I will definitely be going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in day after Thanksgiving & everyone had the same idea as my daughter. Had it not been for her great idea to be here I'd have left! I got my usual German chocolate half stack, Portuguese sausage, and tried their garlic rice and added mushrooms. Daughter had the Frankie kid meal. Hostess was weird. Wait time 30-45mins. Server was great. The food here was a little better than the Durango location I believe in reference to fresh/hotness."}
{"text":"So I've been to a few different locations and this 1 seems to be the closest to me when I'm in town so I've frequented it more. I haven't tried various items, I usually stick to my fave German chocolate pancakes, Portuguese sausage, and seasoned potatoes. Everything is always solid. Haven't experienced any issues. Today they forgot my Portuguese sausage, but everything else was cool. Service is also always pleasant. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I really liked the carrot cake pancakes ESPECIALLY because of the cream cheese syrup. I think that made the dish, even though it's more like dessert than breakfast. Service was pretty quick, if not super friendly.
Locally owned is a plus, but minus for the location (wish it was closer to me)."}
{"text":"Dear Babystacks,

I did my due diligence by bringing my whole party of 5 in at the same time... Please do yours and sit people in the order they arrived. One of the girls at the front seemed a little confused after the other girl asked her why sat the party that came after us before us... And then laughed it off... Thanks- we have been loyal but we will be going to The Cracked Egg from now on!"}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place regularly back when I first moved to Vegas but I'm glad to come back about four years later to see that everything remained great as usual! 

As expected there was a wait but even though we were quoted about 45 minutes, it ended up being only a 25 minute wait! Service was great, it was hectic but the servers and hostesses kept their cool. Major props today since it was so busy because of the holiday. 

They have a wide selection to choose from on their menu. On the front, you have what you would expect from breakfast/brunch joints such as egg and meat entrees, omelettes, pancakes, and skillets. On the back, you have a variety of Asian-fusion choices. 

The portions are quite large and most entrees come with potatoes or toasts on the side. When you're trying this place out for the first time, definitely get the Red Velvet Pancakes because the hype is real for those suckers. They're so fluffy and tasty! The Spam Scramble is also a must try. It looks like something your mom might make at home but Babystacks makes them with a such a tasty twist by adding Furikake. 

Don't know why I stopped coming here regularly when everything is so great but I guess I shall be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have brunch and based on the reviews it seemed like a no-brainer. I will say the service was great! Very prompt, very courteous... not a single problem. 

I'm giving three stars because the food was ok. There wasn't anything wrong specifically. It was just eh. I had the Huevos Rancheros with a short stack of Cinnabun pancakes. The entree was decent but tasted a bit bland. It came with hash brown which seemed to have been heated up in a microwave and seared for a couple seconds. Again, it's just my opinion but there's wasn't much about the Huevos Rancheros to rave about. The top pancake of the short stack was awesome! But because they really only drizzle with frosting the top one, the other two seemed a bit dryer. 

All in all, the food was average but the service was great... enough to come back and try something else. There were plates I saw being ordered that looked fantastic. So the three stars may go up after an update. 

At any rate, I would recommend this place. Your experience may differ."}
{"text":"The wait was 45 minutes.  The hostess let us know that it could be longer.  We walked around the block, then sat outside.

The food was adequate.  I had the hazelnut pancakes and my guest had the grilled cheese sandwich with pork.  He said the sandwich was unique and delicious.

The server took our order right away since we had plenty of time to decide what to order while we were waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. My boyfriend and I used to love going to the first location in town we were so excited that they opened a southwest location by our house. I ordered banana foster pancakes with no sauce or Carmel just wanted bananas and whip cream pretty easy right? Wrong. They brought them out and they were drenched in Carmel the pancakes were swimming in a sea of Carmel, very smiley soggy, so I politely asked for them to remake them like I asked in the first place the serve argued but then finally re made them. They were brought out a second time almost the same but this time the pancakes were swimming in a sea of butter. I politely stated this still isn't what I ordered and stated I have order them before at the other location and at this location once before and the server argued with me stating I was in the wrong so I just said never mind can I just get normal pancakes. The normal pancakes finally came out fine. The couple next to us even stated that that was ridiculous they even knew what I wanted. Pancakes topped with bananas and whip cream. When the check was presented nothing was discounted she charged us for extra items then when we asked to see a manger she said she was the manager and kept telling us we were in the wrong and she had a very hostile attitude  I don't appreciate being treated that way no costumer should. Horrible costumer service. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I have never been to any other location of Babystacks Cafe so I can not say how this one measures up to others. All I know is I LOVED the meal I had here over this past weekend.

Allison S. and I decided to have a late breakfast at Babystacks before doing a little shopping. There was a decent sized crowd of people waiting to be seated at the fairly small cafe when we arrived, but the wait was only about 25 minutes. 

I was tempted by the red velvet pancakes that Babystacks is known for, but when I saw that one of the daily specials was the strawberry lemonade pancakes (which I had already dreamed about, after seeing the photo Suzy H. posted) I had to order that. I went with a short stack, and added a side of sausage, and it was more than enough food for me. 

The pancakes were perfection, just the right amount of lemony tartness topped with fresh strawberries and delicious cream cheese icing, plus a huge serving of whipped cream. I have had fluffier pancakes, but the flavor profile completely made up for any lack of fluff. I stole a bite of Allison's spinach benedict and that was super yummy as well.

Service was spot on. Babystacks remained busy the entire duration of our visit, and while it was clear that our server was working hard, she was an absolute sweetheart and she always had a smile on her face. Our water and coffee cups stayed filled and our food came out fairly quickly. 

Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Babystacks and look forward to returning to try some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Babystacks Cafe - Henderson (2017 Yelp Review #236)

I've been a fan of Babystacks since the day I moved here.  Babystacks is very popular, especially during the weekends.  So, expect about 30 minute wait to be seated.  Their known for their specialty pancakes, including their red velvet. It's been a long time since I've had their pancakes, but I remember them to be fluffy and awesome.  Besides their pancakes, I recommend the Portuguese Sausage, the Loco Moco, and the Adobo Fried Rice.  In my opinion, Babystacks serves the best Portuguese Sausage in town.  Prices for everything on their menu is better than average and the service is always spot on."}
{"text":"First of all, I can't believe that this is my first review of BabyStacks (formerly BabyCakes).  I've been to Baby Stacks a ton of times and it's this specific location that happens to be my favorite. Then I realize, my visits were all before I started Yelping.  

BabyStacks use to be a staple for breakfast before I moved out here.  The restaurant is small and can get crowded, but once you're seated be prepared for a breakfast treat worth bragging about.  I'm not embarassaed to admit, there was a time I was here weekly.  From service to their food, you cannot go wrong with this place.  

-Red Velvet Pancakes:  This is what they are known for and if you haven't tried it, it's a must.  Review the photos and tell me you can't resist.  

-White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes:  This is actually my favorite stack here. Imagine eating your favorite Macadamia nut cookie transformed to a fluffy pancake. 

-Garlic Rice:  My favorite dangerous dish all time.  The rice looks plain, but it's so good and melts in your mouth.  Who describes rice to melt in your mouth? I do, that's who.  This another suggestion.

-Adobo Fried Rice:  One of my newer favorites here.  Not as big as say Aloha's Kitchen, but I think it's better in taste.  A healthy serving of rice and chicken Adobo wrapped in an egg omelet.  

-Loco Moco:  Hit and miss with their Loco Moco's.  Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's just okay.  I think it's maybe due to the fact I think Hawaiian BBQ makes the best Loco Moco.  

-The Others:  Then you got the traditional stuff that will not disappoint like eggs, sausage, their Portuguese sausage.  Their Portuguese sausage is also very good.

If you're visiting Vegas, BabyStacks is sure to be one of your highlights.  After you've tried BabyStacks, you will not be impressed with the others out there.  Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"Nearly 7 months since my last visit to this specific BabyStacks. So, an updated review was in need. 

Whether you're local or visiting, you have to try Babystacks at least once.  My opinion, still one of the best breakfast joints in town.  You can still get your eggs, bacon, and hash browns at BabyStacks.  But let's be honest, it's all about their stacks.  You can't go wrong with most of their pancakes and it's their Red Velvet that they're known for. Other favorites for me include their Portuguese Sausage, Loco Moco (IKR?), Garlic Rice, Biscuits/Gravy, Macadamia Stack, and their Adobo Fried Rice. 

Regarding this specific location, I have to say it's the best one to go to if you're looking for less of a wait and a bigger location.  At this location, you're almost seated immediately.  However, I still think the North Buffalo location is better.  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just loyal, but I think the food taste just a tad better at the north location. But please, continue to go the south location so that I don't have to wait as long at the north one. 

TIP:  On my most recent visit, I did something that I never do. I got a full stack of their Red Velvet pancakes. A short stack is usually good enough, especially if you're just complimenting a main dish.  I don't believe in wasting food so I cleaned my plate. I don't think I ate for at least another 5 hours after."}
{"text":"I'm super happy to have stumbled to this little restaurant! It's located about 20 min from the strip. I went here on Saturday morning and boy was there a line! Waited about 50 minutes! Can't really complain about the wait since it was a breakfast place and I did come on a weekend. The ladies that serve us was very friendly! I ordered the piglet skillet and upgraded my pancakes to the red velvet pancakes and let me tell you nothing was left on that plate!! It was sooo good!!! The steak and eggs was absolutely delish! The best part about eating with the family that I was able to taste also the banana cream pie pancakes and adobo burrito! Everything I tastes was really good! I see why there was a line! I have to say that those Hispanic line cooks, can definitely cook adobo!!! If ever you are in Vegas this must be on your list!!"}
{"text":"I had to visit a relative in Centennial (North of Summerlin), while I was in the Ninth Island (Vegas).  He suggested we eat at Babystacks that serves some Hawaiian Style grinds, and I'm glad he did.  Its located on Durango near Elkhorn, just off the 95.

We ordered Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice ($9.95 | chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette), with your choice of side.  I chose mac salad, while my friends chose country potatoes.  BS also offers loco moco, portuguese sausage, corned beef hash, as well as crepes and other traditional bfast items.

Da adobo fried rice was winnahzzz!  The chicken adobo was moist and nicely seasoned.  BTW, adobo has Spanish roots combining salty & sour flavors.  The Filipino version uses shoyu & vinegar to accomplish the foregoing.  It went well w/ the omelette, and we were stuffed afterwards:  5 Stars.  On the other hand, the mac salad was suprisingly bad.  It was comparable to store bought mac salad:  2 Stars.

Regarding the ambiance, this is a big place.  There are several tables in addition to a counter.  The space is flexible so you can combine tables for large parties:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the service was really good.  Our waiter was super friendly, and the remainder of the team gave us a lot of Aloha:  4 Stars.

Mahalos to my cuz for the rec on Babystacks.  The entire experience was very positive.  If you don't mind a little drive from the Strip, hit this local place.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Yelp, you led me astray. I believed the four and five star reviews. I believed in you all. 

Instead, I was led to a land of hockey puck pancakes, and bacon bits scattered only in the center of those hockey puck bacon pancakes. Literally... bacon bits. In the pancakes. The bacon pancakes. I ordered bacon pancakes, not bacon bit pancakes. Guys. It was half assed and terrible. Who, after naming their cafe AFTER THEIR PANCAKES, has the gall to screw up those pancakes? That's awfully brave and jerky of you, BabyStacks. I'm kind of peeved about the whole thing.

My boyfriend's omelet was sad. It looked like a pancake with dried cheese on top. 10.00 for that? I mourned.

Hazelnut pancakes were dry but the whipped cream wasn't bad. 

Didn't catch my server's name. Didn't catch much of him actually.

The hostess asked how everything was. I said \"Eh. Barely okay.\" She cheerily continued ringing me up and said, \"great!\"

That's about it."}
{"text":"Hmm, where do I start on my review...let me first tell you, I am not a breakfast person at all, the mister, however, loves his breakfast.. So one Saturday morning we decide we'd check out Babycakes.  I do happen to love red velvet cakes when done right so were looking forward to the red velvet pancakes, even though I'm not a pancake fan.

Anyhow, we arrive at about 11:30 on a Saturday and the wait is 45mins, okay, we say, let's hope it was worth it.  It wasn't too bad, the actual wait time was about 30mins and we were seated.  There was all types of people, lots of families.  I order the Kahlua pig Benedict and half order of velvet pancakes, the mister got something ( can't recall so it was probably not that memorable) and banana pancakes.  He said his was just okay, but he tried my velvet pancakes and fell in love.  My Kahlua pig was so good, it had cabbage and shredded pork, just the right amount of hollandaise.

My velvet pancakes is were I was hooked, which is a lot for me considering I am not a fan of pancakes.  The pancake was soft and warm and the cream cheese syrup had just the right amount of sweetness....Babycakes has made me a fan of breakfast!  I will definitely be back, next time with my daughter cause I know she will be hooked just like her mama!"}
{"text":"HOMESTYLE BREAKFAST 
(3.75 stars)

- long wait, average 30-45 minutes 
- place isn't fancy, just a small cafe 
- portion to price is favorable 
 
The meals at this place is influenced by Hawaiian, Filipino, and American items. We drove away from the strip to eat before we went to the Rise Festival - definitely had this place in mind because we were thinking \"big breakfast\" before spending hours in the Mojave dessert. It seems to be the local's favorites and outsiders (like myself) have come to take over and create longer lines. 

LOLA CORA'S CORNED BEEF HASH AND EGGS - served with your choice of the following: (2) buttermilk babystacks or toast and steamed rice or potatoes, and eggs of your choice. Upgrade to garlic rice $1, Upgrade to your favorite babystack (extra charge). I tried to upgrade to their special that had rick's adobo fried rice but was declined and therefore I settled for garlic fried rice. MUST upgrade the buttermilk babystacks to RED VELVET. The corned beef hash is house made, not greasy, and had a nice corn beef flavor without it being too salty. It's hard to write a review about cornbeef and garlic fried rice.

Sorry, I'm not posting my pictures... it was challenging to take a pretty picture of corned beef hash. 

Until the next bite...."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time..reserved rating. Pigs in a Blanket were plentiful but dry. Wife's Garlic Rice w/Portugese Sausage, Gravy and Eggs were delicious. They have lots of unique items on the menu and we will continue to eat here to try them out. Service was good, lots of parking and prices were reasonable. Recommended to others."}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews from yelp. It really was extremely delicious - we were here in December on a week day and didnt have to wait to be seated. The food took a little long to come out,  but the deliciousness made up for it."}
{"text":"EVERYONE enjoyed their breakfast. The Banana Foster pancakes were very moist and the flavor was fantastic. The Mexican Skillet was the bomb and also very flavorful. My youngest daughter loved her cookies and cream pancake. My oldest daughter who doesn't like pancakes enjoyed the coffee flavored pancake and my 4th daughter says her French Toast was great."}
{"text":"This is definitely a must go to when you're in Vegas. It's a ways away from the Strip but worth the trip - especially for the fluffy pancakes. I'm not really a pancake person unless they're stuffed with chocolate chips of made of red velvet. And these gave the Buttermilk Truck cakes a run for their money. My potatoes were a tad bland but after sampling everyone else's breakfasts I can say everything else was delish! Our waiter was everything a waiter should be and we didn't wait more than 5 minutes when our table was ready even though we had been told there was a 45 minute wait. I was a happy gal after breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow you would never know by pulling up and looking at the place.    amazing Breakfast.   I was just driving by hungry and took a chance I had a skillet in the red velvet pancakes and oranges it was 15 bucks can't beat that deal in Vegas and it tasted absolutely wonderful could be my new favorite offi strip breakfast joint

Back again for the cowboy skillet and the carrot cake pancakes.   10 stars if it would let me"}
{"text":"Babystacks is notorious for their Red Velvet Pancakes and boy are they tasty. I always got them to go and whenever i wanted to sit down, i get myself a stack. Inside is a bit small, but since its open only for breakfast and lunch there's really no need for a big place, i kind of like it like this.

Last time i ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. It was good for the most part but it was quite salty. A little too salty for my taste, maybe next time i order it, ill ask not to make it so salty aha. anyways still a 5/5 because of their Red Velvet Pancakes."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Staff were really nice... food was great. Prices were not over the top. 

Do stop in and give them a try...well worth the short drive from the strip to enjoy a great breakfast. 

Get there early! Place is small... but.,... I think they are moving to a larger location... so this should help."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes! That's what got me to want to try Babystacks Cafe, and I was not disappointed! They are absolutely the BEST! Just the right thickness, a little crisp on the edges, soft, tasty and most importantly not too sweet. The Cream Cheese Syrup, fresh Whipped Cream and bits of chocolate crumbles top the order off perfectly. I am salivating just thinking bout them!

We've been there a bunch of times and there is usually a wait, anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour no matter what day of the week you go. The second location at Buffalo and Flamingo is larger and sometimes you can walk right in there, we go there on occasion but still prefer the charm of the original locale. The servers are always friendly and even when the place is packed the food comes out quickly and piping hot. 

I've tried a plethora of the pancakes, but I keep going back to the Red Velvet! My second fav would the the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, sweet, tasty and done to perfection. The Smores, Rocky Road and Bacon are all good as well. The Carrot Cakes, however, had a good flavor, but were a bit dry .. maybe an off day for whomever made them? 

Babystacks also offers a full menu of different breakfast and lunch type items for those who are not craving pancakes. The Biscuits and Gravy are delicious and we usually get an order to share. That way we have sweet AND savory for breakkie. The gravy is flavorful and they give plenty of it. Sooooo good! A friend of mine had the Mexican Omelet which he said was perfectly done and just the right amount of spices and heat. 

This is definitely a place I would recommend .. the prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, the service is great. The only thing I would say is that it's not really set up for larger parties as it's quite small. If you are wanting to do something for more than 6 people, you may want to take it to the Buffalo / Flamingo location."}
{"text":"Cards on the table, coming to this restaurant today, we were confusing the name with another local place that we have been to many times and liked a lot. That said, this was our first time at Babystacks. Two people ordering a fairly standard breakfast... $30. Breakfast doesn't cost  $30. For $30 I expect a life experience. We ordered eggs, sausage links, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, and potatoes between the two of us. My scrambled eggs were over done. I don't expect my eggs to be crispy. The sausage was greasy... to be expected of links... but all but flavorless. The biscuits and gravy were interesting. Buttery or cheesey.. not sure.. but also kind of sweet. I didn't finish them... I walked in starving and I love breakfast food.. didn't finish. 

Restaurant was still very full and seems to get reviewed well. I just don't understand the attraction. What's it cost.. maybe a nickel to make a pancake! $30! I'll pay too much for good food, but I'd put this place in par with a Denny's. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Wow this is the best breakfast brunch I've ever had. I ordered the kalua pig Benedict and the small stack red velvet pancake. Let me tell you the Benedict was heavenly. Never had it with kalua pig and it was genius. If youre in the area go here."}
{"text":"The number of pancakes on this menu is mind blowing!! I got the cookie butter french toast and it tasted so delicious! If you are having a sweet tooth in the morning, this place is the place to go! Their kuhlua grilled cheese is also super duper amazing and their lemon pancakes! The prices are not too bad for the amount that is given to you and the workers are incredibly nice!"}
{"text":"The pancakes were really good. They were light and fluffy but packed full of flavor. You can tell they put a lot of care into their pancakes and perfecting cupcake-like pancake batters. They had many flavors like lemon ricotta, peanut butter, strawberry and we had a hard time choosing. We decided to go with red velvet and carrot cake pancakes. Both were awesome and served with a cream cheese syrup. One suggestion for them, selfishly speaking, would be to create a pancake sampler to give customers an opportunity to try a variety of their flavors. We had to order two separate dishes just so we could taste more than one of their flavors."}
{"text":"Well the red velvet pancakes are all that everyone says they are! LOVE THEM!!! Since this spot is around the corner from my house, my husband wants to eat there couple mornings a week!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST banana pancakes I have ever had! Seriously.... These cakes are legit!  Great service and friendly staff. We will be back."}
{"text":"More than the food...i'm loving the red velvet pancakes...it's what I look forward to each time I come here."}
{"text":"love this place! the only problem is this location is pretty small and they are usually pretty busy unless you go early enough! delicious food!"}
{"text":"Woke up in the afternoon and was craving for breakfast and this place popped up and decided to give it a try.  I'd definitely not recommend coming to vegas right now cuz it's 115 F right now and wow it's so hot I can barely touch anything in my car lol.

On to the restaurant, it's a nice size spot inside a new looking plaza (no shade parking though) sigh
Everyone working there is really friendly and after the recommendations we decided to order french toast combo w sausage and eggs, country fried steak and eggs, add: red velvet pancakes ($1.50 extra), cranberry juice and chocolate milk. Everything tasted wonderful but the red velvet pancakes itself just taste like pancakes w red dye...it def lacks the red velvet cake flavor.  But if you combine the whip cream and white sugar syrup that comes w it, it sord of resembles that flavor.  The chocolate milk taste like milk w a hint of chocolate (I think).

Overall: pretty decent breakfast place considering the location :)  might return again if I ever come visit my friend this way and craving for breakfast."}
{"text":"I would give this place a better review if I didn't have egg shells in my omelet. Popular, casual, nice Hawaiian music in the background. Pointed out to the waiter there egg shells in my food. His response; \"Uh, other than the egg shells, how is everything\"? \"Oh, and I told the cooks\". REALLY? I told the hostess & she said she would have brought me another omelet. I told her she should have been my server."}
{"text":"Had the Ricks adobo fried rice omelet and OMG it was a mouthgasm. The service was so good and food  arrived so fast i could've sworn i was at McDonalds. Go eat there now, the end"}
{"text":"This is a fun and cute restaurant. The bacon pancakes are delicious with just the right amount of fluff. My coffee was never empty and always piping hot. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Lets get one thing straight: the red velvet pancakes are not food.  They are dessert and pretty darn sweet even then.  This can be a plus or a negative.  I actually wish that they were a little less decadent since then I'd still order them on occasion.  As is this is a good place for breakfast and I like the adobo omelet thing as a \"something different\" on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent pancake house meets Hawaiian and Filipino diner food.  It was a bit of a zoo on Saturday morning, but managed to get a seat at the counter.  This location is out in the burbs in Henderson

I went with the LoLo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, basically a Filipino rice omelette, and some Bananas Foster pancakes.  Both were excellent; I really should not have eaten it all."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast this is where I go! When I have family in town, this is where I take them. I've had red velvet pancakes at other places but this one takes the cake! The service is friendly and they make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about.  Basic as can be. Coffee was shit. OJ &  Grapefruit juices both shit. Cheap ingredients I would never personally buy at the store,  could make everything on the menu 10x better at home. Hate to hate...  just don't like it when I see 5 stars and amazing reviews just to find out its pretty much iHop or worse.  Other than that, props and respect to the owner for making a killing off cheap product and low human standards on food."}
{"text":"If your ever looking for local Hawaiian breakfast food in Las Vegas, this is the spot!!! The servers are sooo nice & friendly!! And the food is awesome! The only thing is to be prepared for a long wait. Try to go early!! This place is pretty small but definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Everytime i come back, my review just gets lower and lower. 

I order the same steggs again. Like always. 

This time, the meat was raw. Idky i didnt take a picture of it. The outside was a bit too cooked, and the inside was just raw. 
The customer next to me said he was a cook and even commented saying that it was raw. I told the waitress and shes like: \"no that is medium rare. If its too rare for you, we can get it cooked a little more.\"

Im like uhh sure. And then the customer next to us repeats: im a cheff, that meat is just raw. 

Thought it was over when they brought it back the second time. Nope. It was still raw on the thicker side. And when i say raw, like im literally talking raw and its cold on the inside. :|

They take it back the third time and gave me a burnt piece of steak. This is literally the steak they gave me. A half eaten burnt steak. 

What the actual fuck? They actually want to give me a stomach ache and cancer. At the same time!!!"}
{"text":"My first time going to babycakes food was great service was good I had to scramble eggs with green onions in them and garlic rice spareribs I thought it was a little odd for breakfast but hands-down the best breakfast I had in a long time"}
{"text":"Came here early Saturday morning and was the best 20 mins I waited for breakfast while on vacation. Drive in from Vegas after mother saw amazing reviews of Babycakes and people were dead on with reviews. Red Velvet pancakes were mouth watering. Service was great. Takes you back to Hawaii the moment you step inside the restaurant. Get here early in the morning so you won't have to wait long."}
{"text":"OMG! In love with the bacon pancakes and I don't even like pancakes. A definite must for foodies! Made my favorite list of things to do while in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awful service by teenage children who were more concerned with talking to one another and playing on phones. After waiting over 20 minutes for our party of three to be seated when there was an abundance of open tables (they didn't want to push two tables together to accommodate our party, yet sat parties of two at large tables...hmmmm) we walked out. Food is decent, but not worth the wait or lack of service."}
{"text":"Well, let's start off with the location: it is away from the hustle and bustle of the busy Las Vegas Strip and not too far that it's too close to the mountains. I love it!

Next, well, it's a small cozy nook so I expect that parking is minimal.. It's located inside a commercial complex so parking is not bad.. We just had to circle around once to find a suitable parking for our truck.

Being that it is a cozy little nook, of course waiting area is a bit packed when we got in. Cashier is also right there by the door so you have people trying to get out and people trying to get in at the same area.. One plus, there are benches where you can sit while you and your party waits. My only biggest comment would be that, I wish the hostess would smile. She doesn't look happy at all.. All the while, there's a sign that says \"be nice or leave\".. Well, how do you expect people to be nice and friendly when your hostess does not acknowledge the guest at all let alone smile? Even after I said thank you after she sat us at our table.. Still no smile. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't rude or anything.. But just please smile!

Our server on the other hand, Jamie, is very friendly and accommodating. All smiles and cheerful! She made sure my drinker are re-filled all the time.. She's very attentive. Great service! Good job!

Now, my favorite part of the review.. FOOD! Being a chef, this is where I tend to focus on. We ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in omelet. That was bomb!!! So tasty and fluffy! Absolutely delicious! As a side for it, I ordered Rocky Road Pancake. That was good too! Our server suggested to get that instead of the s'mores pancake. I'm happy I did! Then, we also ordered the Kahlua Grilled Cheese Sandwich. My fiancé said it was really good but if only the portion is bigger for the price they sell it for. And lastly, I ordered Loco Moco. That was amazing! But it wasn't enough rice.. Lol. I had to order an additional side of rice. Now, the macaroni salad that came with it, it was a bit bland. Could use more mayo and salt & pepper. Other than that, food was better than expected.. Service was amazing.

I would absolutely come back at Baby Stacks! Perhaps try the other food choices they have.. And hopefully when I come back, I'll be greeted by a hostess with a big smile on her face!"}
{"text":"Color me a fan.

I never made the trip all the way out west to try any of the older BabyStacks Cafe locations, but now that they're easily accessible to us Henderson-lings, I made it a point to go as soon as I reasonably could. That opportunity came this morning.

Walking in, I saw that it was packed and that people were sitting in the front area. Bit of confusion at the front when they didn't ask me whether I wanted to sit down or make a to-go order, so I asked if I could sit. Most of the tables looked full, and I wasn't sure whether the people in the front were waiting for a table or for a to-go order, but one of the employees told me that they had room at the counter and I immediately accepted.

After agonizing over the menu for a while, I went ahead and got a full stack of red velvet pancakes ($8.95) with a side of two eggs ($2.00), scrambled per my choice. It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, but I don't mind a little wait when the food is supposed to be good.

Turns out that it was really, really good. What I saw was a platter of six red pancakes, each about four inches in diameter, topped with a huge dollop of cold whipped cream, a dusting of chocolate sprinkles, and a plastic cup of cream cheese \"syrup\" (plus a second cup later when my server asked if I wanted more). What I tasted was absolute indlgence. The fluffy pancakes with a bit of crispiness on the edges, the cold cream to provide a temperature contrast, and the almost buttery syrup were all enjoyable to the last bite, even after I got almost sickeningly full. Heavenly.

Eggs were alright. Not sure if they were even large eggs, but I wanted some protein so I got some. Maybe I could've added a bit of salt, but no biggie. They served their purpose.

I wish that they'd stay open for dinner, but I'll take what I can get. Hopefully their Hawaiian/Filipino specialites measure up to the luxurious red velvet pancakes. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I have given this place 2 tries now and think I have a good idea of the restaurant. The food is good but could be warmer, the items don't seem hot just warm. Service both times has been subpar and well, bad. The prices are decent and the serving sizes match. I wouldn't say this place is worth the wait or that anything stands out on the menue. This is a good breakfast joint for the area to avoid the Cafe at Sunset or the drive-thru."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot for Hawaii locals in my opinion.  Locals like rice with their breakfast. I always upgrade to garlic rice.  I used to get the spam scramble or just Kalua pig, eggs and rice, but now I typically get the country fried steak.. So Ono!  They also have a vast selection of pancakes.  I love the island music, the tvs on sports, all the local people that come in, the staff is so friendly and personable.  I totally feel like I'm home and it's always nice to see people in there that are obviously not from Hawaii.  Just talking about it now, I think I'm going to head on down!  It's only a block from my house which is always great.  Anyone who lives in Vegas knows westside is the best side! Oh! The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars, is one time I ordered for take out and when I ate it at home it didn't taste nearly as good; my garlic rice was weighed down and my Kalua pig was just whatever."}
{"text":"5 star everytime!!!!!! Their cookie butter French toast is unreal!!! We showed up at the height of their busy hour. That hour when people finally decide to roll out of bed from Saturday night. They were very busy and the wait time was expected to be 40 minutes but we were seated and waited upon in 10 :). Everyone there is always so happy and up beat. Great way to start my day. Thanks Babystacks!!! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"The original Babycakes/stacks

Located on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch in the small strip mall next to Sierra Gold and a Hair Color Xperts. Plenty of car parks in the lot.

So your hungry or needing something sweet, Babystacks has got you covered from every angle. Traditional Breakfasts, Hawaiian breakfast, kids Meals and the Famous Pancakes are all on the menu.

I've been coming here since this place opened, and I'm never disappointed. The service is always prompt and the meals are always cooked and prepared in a timely fashion.

I Always recommended the signature dish of Red Velvet pancakes with white chocolate but in recent times I have been here, the Banana Foster pancakes have been outstanding!

Extremely kid friendly with high chairs and coloring to keep them occupied. Also adult friendly Flat screens with news or sports on tv to keep the grown ups occupied.

Weekends are a tricky one, due to the popularity of Babystacks the line up can get crazy so I recommend during the week.

{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite breakfast and lunch places! The adobo fried rice is my go to and I get it 99% of the time. I do love the garlic rice, lemon ricotta pancakes (and I usually don't like pancakes but theirs rocks) and their Benedict's are delicious too!"}
{"text":"If I could work here for food I would but then I'd have to spend all my free time at the gym! I'm so in love with the food! Everything was cooked perfectly right down to my over easy eggs and bacon. I love that they offer short stack pancakes. Took my sister and she got loco moco, I got the cookie butter French toast meal (what heaven tastes like), and we shared a short stack of red velvet pancakes. Ended up taking the pancakes home because we were too full lol. Great experience and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Place of the famous red velvet pancakes!


This breakfast place is highly sort after by locals and people from afar. The menu is extensive pancakes that make your mouth water. I've had the pulled pork once before and thought it was great.

The weekends can be pretty packed full with lines out the door but it's to be expected. I'll put it simply, Babystacks is one of the top breakfast places in the valley, yeah it's busy busy place, but the reason is because it's great quality food with great service.

{"text":"The Huntington Skillet legitimately changed my life. So good, so fast, and a perfect portion. The cookies and cream pancakes we're also delicious, and the staff was gracious. We walked in at like 1:50 but everyone was still nice and friendly. It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"During our Vegas \"Getaway\" my wife and I were tired of breakfast buffet's so we decided to check this place out to get away from the cigarette smoke and drunks. The place is very small and the wait was about 25 min. The server was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs. My food was very bland. No flavor! i added salt, ketchup and Tabasco and then we had something good going. I ordered the Orange Creamsicle pancakes and they were just okay. Nothing out of this world or won't make me go back. All i can say is that this place is better than going to a Casino buffet."}
{"text":"I have left previous review on amazing breakfast places but this by far is my favorite. I always get the Portuguese sausage and eggs and rice. With a side of corned beef and I upgrade my pancakes to the red velvet. It comes with a cream cheese sauce and it's to die for. They are owned by Hawaii people so they are always playing Hawaiian music which is so comforting if you're also from the islands ! Make sure to go there and you'll be hooked. It's always busy to allow some extra time if you're in a time crunch."}
{"text":"Great service. Place is always packed but so worth the wait. I love the red velvet pancakes they are my fav!!  I'm glad they have other locations now."}
{"text":"I really like this place and this is the first less than meal I have head there. I usually get the adobo fried rice and it is always good. Today my wife had the Loco Moco and it was great. I tried the biscuits and gravy and it was poor. The biscuits tasted like they were the nasty cheap frozen kind and the the gravy was bland and luke warm upon arrival. I believe this is an isolated incident as the other dozen or so times I have been there the food was good. So I rate them A-OK."}
{"text":"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in higher end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

Babystacks Cafe is a breakfast/lunch cafe offering pancakes, eggs, omelets and sandwiches.  We stopped in for breakfast.  Marginal pancakes that tasted good but that were very dry. Our omelets were nothing to write home about with obviously frozen seasoned potatos. Its hard to mess up breakfast and while these weren't \"messed up\", they just were not good.  We recently ate at another \"diner\" near by. For the same money we received an excellent meal, huge and tasty . . . very much unlike that at Babystacks Cafe.  There are too many other better choices to risk another visit."}
{"text":"Friend took me to try their pork adobo fried rice omelette! Was very tasty! Cleaned my plate! Pancakes were very good also! Service was fast and friendly! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Thank God for Yelp, I would have never given this cafe a second glance in it's location.. but my fellow Yelpers told me it's a must go to place and so I went.  YUMMY!!  I am an eggs benedict connoisseur and have returned my share over the years, but today's breakfast was not going to leave my sight after my first bite.  This was ridiculous good, here is the twister, it was a Country Eggs Benedict, perfectly toasted english muffins with country sausage (5 stars for the sausage), two perfectly poached eggs and then country sausage gravy covered the entire masterpiece.  Their gravy was on point.  You can taste the freshness of each ingredient in every bite.  Hubby ordered egg whites scrambled with Portuguese sausage and potatoes.  The Portuguese sausage was amazing, so much flavor in each bite.  The potatoes were spiced just right and cooked to perfection.  With his breakfast he also got red velvet pancakes.  The red velvet pancakes were sprinkled with chocolate chips and some whipped cream.  On the side was a cream cheese syrup that is unbelievable.  The pancakes were good, but the syrup is what makes them.  

The staff is so nice, they greeted us immediately and sat us as soon as the table was ready.  My coffee was refilled often and everyone helps there.  You do not have to wait for a particular person, everyone takes care of all the tables."}
{"text":"First time here and will probably be back. Very friendly staff, food was great and the atmosphere was very pleasant playing island music in the background. Great place to have brunch or fill up  before a road trip."}
{"text":"Always packed on the weekends! Get to know your neighbors, you can pretty much hold hands with the people next to you. Food is good, but it's just too crowded for my liking."}
{"text":"Very wonderful small cafe.  I had the corned beef and hash with the cinnabon pancakes and hubby had adoba omelete and bacon short stack.  I loved my meal but hubby says there was something missing from his omelet. I would definitely come back this is an awesome breakfast place we came around 11am and both locations on buffalo where very crowded. Our wait time was around 25-30 min.  Our waitress was super busy so the serve time was not quick but it was well worth it. Very accommodating to my request for an iced coffee."}
{"text":"Oh BabyStacks, I love you so much!  Staff is always friendly and attentive.  Food is always delicious.  This place consistently impresses me with their service and dishes.  I've been here at various times and different days and this place is always busy.  Normally when I come here I expect at least a 20-30 minute wait, but they usually are pretty good about seating you before the time they tell you.  Let me tell you it is well worth the wait!  However, if you are feeling particularly hungry and can't wait out the time, I recommend going up to the cashier and ordering your food to go.  When I do this I usually wait at most 10-15 minutes for my food and am on my merry way.
 
My top recommendations are the red velvet pancakes ($5.75 for the short stack) when I first ordered this I was scared that it would be overly sweet, but it's just the right amount.  The pancakes itself are fluffy circles of heaven and the cream cheese syrup compliments it perfectly.  I also like the banana cream pie pancakes ($5.75 for the short stack) and the banana foster pancakes ($5.95 for the short stack) as well.  I always get a side of their crispy bacon ($3.95) too.  Come here to treat your taste buds to a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"Awesome food little pricey for breakfast food but good! Eggs Benedict has to be my favorite"}
{"text":"One of our favorite comfort Hawaii foods to go to when in Las Vegas. Babystacks Cafe are all over the place and you'll surely find one nearby. All the menus are the same. I usually get the chicken adobo fried rice. The portions are big, so bring your appetite or you'll be asking for a take out container.  My 9 year old son got the red velvet short stack which he said was good and he's a critic like his mom, lol!  I definitely recommend for breakfast and lunch. I haven't ate here for dinner yet, but I'm sure I would enjoy it. Great for the family, we had a party of five. Go early to avoid the wait. This place is popular due to the great food and affordable prices."}
{"text":"One of the best Red Velvet Pancakes I ever had.  Even better than the Red Velvet Pancakes in Los Angeles.  The pancakes were sweet and fluffy.  The insides of the pancakes were the prefect color red.  It looks delicious.  It taste delicious.  This going to be my new breakfast spot when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place the food is good and the service is fast love go there on Sunday for brunch before I go to work"}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last visit so I was enthusiastic to return to BabyStacks Cafe. I was headed  west to visit a client so this was the ideal to have some bfast. 

I was greeted and seated immediately but unfortunately I had to flag a waitress down to finally place my order for coffee and a Kula pig Benedict. When my entree arrived I sampled the benedict which was stellar! The kula pig had a smoked flavor and contained green cabbage which harmonized superbly with the medium cooked eggs and hollandaise sauce.

I also noticed they offer Loco moco on the menu. My mouth is watering while writing this and looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place, I always get the s'mores pancakes and the potatoes. The pancakes are super sweet and yummy and the potatoes offset the sweet with the perfect amount of savory spice. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast and brunch!"}
{"text":"Please don't hate me, but I think BabyStacks is a bit over-rated.  It is a good diner but I don't think it blew my socks off at all.

I have heard a lot about BabyStacks and I am always reminded when I drive past it at least once a week.  I am a devoted patron to a different local breakfast dinner and usually go there for breakfast.  We wanted to try something different, so we headed over to try BabyStacks.

Our first mistake was getting there at 10:30am on a Sunday.  Oops and here comes a 45 minute wait.  That was self-inflicted pain, but we dealt with it.  Since we had a long wait, we had already checked out the menu and figured out what we wanted.  The menu has a lot of variety and definitely something for everybody.  This is always nice because I know we can never agree on food at my house.  They have your normal breakfast items like egg dishes, biscuits and gravy, and of course a multitude of pancake choices.  They also have a decent lunch menu with salads, sandwiches, and burgers.  On top of all of that, they have Hawaiian food on the menu.  Like I said, something for everyone.

I wasn't in the mood for breakfast by the time we were sat, so I went with Loco Moco.  It was good, but not great.  It totally hit the spot for my craving, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It came with a side of mac salad and it was really pretty bland, in my opinion. The first time I had Loco Moco was in Maui, so I am probably ruined since I compare everyone's version to the first one, and few compare.   So it was good, but not great.

My hubby got a breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage.  It was a huge burrito and he was only able to eat about 2/3 of it.  It also came with a side of regular pancakes.  The pancakes were ok, but again, nothing special.  Overall, his breakfast was ok and pretty average.

My mini me got the kid's grilled cheese and it was an awesome grilled cheese.  It was super gooey and overflowing with cheesy goodness.  

Now I know what you are going to say, \"Why didn't you try the fancy, smancy pancakes?\" Well, I wasn't in the mood, so there.  Maybe this is why I am only giving it a 3 star rating and didn't get my socks blown off..  We do plan on checking it out again when we are craving pancakes and maybe it will be better next time.  For just regular breakfast food though, I think I will stick with my go-to place around the corner.  Based on this experience though, everything was ok.  The service was ok, the food was ok, and the prices were ok."}
{"text":"Omg! We are hooked! If you are a pancake lover this is the place for you! Excellent prices and service too!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I came in at the right time this morning. There were several tables being used and the restaurant was fairly busy in general. But there were still a few tables open and the counter was completely open. This is where I sat. By the time I was done the place was packed. The tables were full and my newly vacated seat was the only one at the counter. People were waiting in the entry for tables. I beat the crowd today for sure.

Babystacks has an extensive menu. One whole side is nothing but pancakes and omlettes of a varied nature. The other side has sandwiches, burgers and other entrees. This is where I looked for a meal. 
There were a lot of choices that looked intriguing but I chose loco moco with garlic rice and fried potatoes. There is something disgustingly pleasing about a hamburger patty with egg and gravy over rice. I asked for my eggs to be cooked sunny side up. I'm not always a big egg eater but when that yolk and gravy gets down into the rice, oh baby, its good. Get a bite of everything on one fork and watch out. Its a flavor bomb. Add in Babystack's perfectly seasoned and browned fried potatoes and you have a starch packed breakfast for the ages.

Service was fairly effecient given how busy Babystacks was this morning. It was not overly attentive service but my food and iced tea came out quickly and I didn't have to wait more than maybe a minute to get my check after I finsihed eating. I had a good and filling meal for a fair price."}
{"text":"A Hawaiian breakfast place in Vegas? Very cool. Establishment: clean, Wait staff: kind, energetic and tentative. Food quality: 5/5 portion size: 3/5 which coincides with Food price: 3/5
Good food but a bit pricey for the portion sizes. But overall I WOULD return"}
{"text":"Well, if I am a fan of \"sweet\" breakfasts, I would give them a 4 starts! But I am not! The pancakes have their own homemade flavored syrups, which were really good, but too sweet for me! The place got packed in matter of minutes! The service was not so bad!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place until today, my cup of cocoa had a hair on it l, and I asked the waitress to please change it in a very nice a polite way, and what she did was roll her eyes at me and walked away without even let me finish My sentence. I wish I know that lady's name to tell her manager about her behavior. We walked out and will never be back there again."}
{"text":"I've gone there 2 times now a decent price not cheap but not too expensive I love the foot there thought it's delicious and worth the money"}
{"text":"Fantastic little establishment I found on yelp.  

The food was great, we had a Ranchero and Mexican omelette, Spam and eggs and the carrot cake pancakes.  Everything about the food was fantastic.

The ambiance was awesome.  The hostess made us feel welcomed, as if we were Ohana (that's Family in Hawiian).  Waitress was extremely friendly and was helpful with suggestions since we had never been there.  

There is a little bit of a wait, I think that was because of how good of a place this is.  They seemed to have their regulars because I saw them calling people by their first name.  

I think this place is one of the best places I have visited in Vegas.

The only thing I will knock on this place is the restrooms (sorry I'm picky about certain things), they did need to be attended to.  I would have given this place a 5 STAR rating if it had not been for this one thing."}
{"text":"Went here during a recent trip to Vegas. I thought the food was ok, but \"meh, I've experienced better\" which is 2 stars. Not quite sure what the basis of the numerous 5 star reviews is?? Oh well, on to the next one...!"}
{"text":"Babystacks Cafe has wonderful service. They are quick, polite, and efficient. I ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were pretty yummy. I am not really a huge pancake fan, and I likely won't order them again, but it was definitely worth trying it once. My boyfriend had the banana cream pancakes, which I liked. But more than the red velvet ones. Overall, a fun experience and I look forward to trying other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Babycakes has the best pancakes that I have ever tasted!  The Red Velvet Pancake litterally melted in my mouth.  That is what I call a GOOD pancake.  Anyone know the recipe?  J/K

The fact that I was with family and the atmosphere was fun, made my experience all the much better.  Oh, make sure you try the Filipino dish: Adobo Fried Rice.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly one of the best things I ate in Vegas on my last trip.  We came in as a party of 12 and it took a while for them to accommodate us but it was ok.  The menu was extensive but I chose the baby chick skillet and red velvet pancakes.  The skillet was weird as it didn't come in a hot skillet as I imagined but it was good nonetheless.  The seasoned chicken with mushroom, spinach and runny OM egg topped with my substitution of pepper jack cheese was a good choice.  It was on the high end of garlicness but that wasn't a negative.  I was even more amazed at the red velvet pancakes!  Light and fluffy topped with chocolate crumbles and whipped cream.  Pour the cream cheese syrup on top and it's like eating a cake!  Definitely a must try there!  We also had a friendly server who took good care of us.  I would return the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Babystacks is known for great food and their Blue Diamond location is no different. They regularly have specialty pancakes that are off-menu (just ask) that you can order if you eat in or order for take out."}
{"text":"Normally love this place. I even tell people about it all the time. After today, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody Cuz I would be embarrassed to. First of all,  I ordered a side of bacon extra crispy for my daughter. When the food came, there was no bacon.  I remember ordering it because I asked her if she just wanted one side or two and she said one so I told the server just one side of bacon. So I had to reorder it and said extra crispy. My daughter finally got her bacon and my son and I were already done with our food.  The bacon was not crispy so she only ate part of the bacon that I paid $3.95 for.  Aside from that,  the guy bringing our drinks gave us one straw when we had 2 cold drinks. We had to keep hunting someone down for a straw. The couple at the table next to us didn't even get any.  Then,  nobody came for refills for coffee.  I finally saw someone come out to do refills but he just talked to the one table he refilled and went back in the kitchen.  I was finally asked if I wanted more coffee when the server came to give me my ticket. We had been done eating for about 10 minutes by then.  Today was really disappointing.  By the way, all that time I was waiting for a straw, I watched the guy bring out every drink and just walked away without giving them straws and he had them in his apron pocket"}
{"text":"The reason for 4 stars is because I believe this location is too small to house that many people. You notice this as soon as you walk through the door, there was an inadequate area where people were supposed to sit and wait for tables but that section gets overrun with people within 5 minutes. They should have a designated host/hostess to seat guests. The second reason for only 4 stars is because we knew our server was busy but he didn't refill our drinks the entire time we were sitting there and he didn't great our table for approximately 7-10 minutes. It was busy and I understand that things get lost but I believe management should hire more servers for this venue. 

Let's get on to the food! 
The food is great! I ordered spam and eggs and everything was cooked to my liking. I ordered a side of hazelnut pancakes! Those were also excellent. Family of 4 was happy aside from the drink part. But the food is really very good! Just a few fixes in hiring and this place would deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went there on a saturday morning with a party of 4 and it was packed like crazy. We waited for 35 minutes and I'm not sure it was worth it but still glad I came.

When it came to ordering our food the service was friendly and quick. My hub ordered the eggs benedicts and I ordered the basic 2 egg breakfast with potatoes, bacon nothing out of the ordinary. I also tried some of the pancakes and wasn't impressed, but I'm not really a pancake person to begin with.

The prices in this joint seem to be fair for what your getting, but I don't see myself  making my way back any time soon because it just didn't make a lasting impression on me."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast place outside the strip. Service was fast and staff are accommodating. I'm a breakfast kind of gal and has a sweet tooth so this place is my go-to the moment I wake up . I had the corn beef hash with rice, coffee and red velvet pancake! They have a variety of food to choose from. I left the place satisfied and the feeling that I'll be having breakfast here and will try other items on the menu every time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Our server was great, and our food was decadently absurd (the 4 of us ordered 2 main dishes for the table, a mistake for our meal plans for the rest of the day). Great island vibe and a shorter-than-quoted wait."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and food is good.  The wait is a bit much and some of the \"rules\", while I get the point, seem a bit much for a small mom and pop shop.  Be aware if the party is not there you will not get seated.  But they do a good job overall."}
{"text":"I love breakfast so I was so excited to find a Babystacks opened in my neighborhood.  Now when I want a sweet sugary breakfast I know where I'm going. The red velvet pancakes are a given, but I really like the lemon ricotta pancakes too and they come with the same cream cheese syrup.  I'm sure this place is gonna get crowded in no time."}
{"text":"If you are Craving Red Velvet Pancakes, then This is Your Destination!!!

This is the Only Place I go for them, and They are Delish! But, this isn't the Only Delicious Item on the Menu! They do have a Few Hawaiian Dishes on the Menu as Well...Such as the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet (My Favorite), and the Kalua Pork with Cabbage Benedict that is Very Tasty as Well! Most of the Items on the Menu do Come with your Choice of Hash Browns, or 2 Other Sides, which are listed on the Menu! Portions are Enough for One, but Could be Shared by 2 People! 

Crepes are Also on the Menu, My Sister got the Nutella/Banana Crepes...and they were According to her...Awesome! lol

The Workers are All Very Nice, and Check on You Often! The Cafe is a Little Small, but the Wait Time isn't that Long! There is Ample Parking, and The Overall Look and Feel of the Cafe is Hawaiian Themed, Very Clean, and Tables are Cleaned Very Quick!

Love, Love, Love This Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So many different choices  I ordered their special pancakes of the month -tres leches... They were delicious, so fluffy. My boyfriend ordered the cookie and cream pancakes.. which basically tasted like chocolate cake! Definitely will be coming back whenever I'm in the mood for perfect pancakes!"}
{"text":"Nice clean spot. Friendly staff & prompt service! Great menu selection some unique island style items which is cool. 
Ordered Loco Moco with garlic rice which was good was expecting more but good quality. Chicken adobo omelette was good lil dry but still finished it lol Choc chip & German choc pancakes were amazing! Definitely go back when in Vegas again"}
{"text":"Big portions, crazy pancake flavors! Loved our meal and it was very reasonable priced. Do yourself a favor and leave the strip for breakfast next time you're on Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing pancake selection! Especially love the red velvet pancakes!! Like that I can get breakfast with an island flare to it - the garlic fried rice is a great side item.  Beware though this is not a place that you will probably be able to be seated immediately, every time we have gone here or to the other location we will wait about 15 minutes minimum for a table.  If it is a holiday weekend be prepared to wait about 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The only thing is the waiting. It's a small restaurant so the wait is a little longer. Every time I go I'm never disappointed. One of my favorite babystacks are the red velvet pancakes, they are so scrumptious!!! The great thing is they have soooo many different style pancakes to choose from. They have a great menu as well. Lots of dishes to choose from, from omelets to skillets, typical breakfast dishes. I have to admit even on my lazy days I order them for pick up."}
{"text":"This place is great. I can't say that I've tried a lot of things on their menu, but I can say what I've had has been excellent. 
They are very well known for their red velvet pancakes and for a good reason. I don't eat a lot of pancakes. Matter of fact I never eat pancakes, but when I come here I always eat their red velvet pancakes. Delicious. First off they are cooked perfectly. They are not too sweet, but if you like them sweeter you add more of the cream cheese syrup or the perfect whip cream. 
The adobo fried rice is bomb. Wrapped in an egg it looks like an omelet until you cut it open and delicious fried rice with adobo is inside. It seems like most people have tried this place, but if you haven't then you must."}
{"text":"As always, their food is very satisfying and the service is excellent.  We ordered Cowboy Omelet, cookie butter french toast and kalua benedict. It was spot on, comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"BabyStacks... I Love Pancakes and I Love BabyStacks

My Vegas family took me here for Brunch and boy was I excited! The moment we parked the car, my nose knew we were where we should be. As I floated to the door towards that amazing aroma, I noticed the place was packed with locals. SCORE!!!

I had the Red Velvet with Cream Cheese Icing, Heavennnnnn.
I also had the Peanut Butter and Jelly. The batter was peanut butter. Need I say more?!?!

They also have spam and eggs, awesome! I just want to try them ALL! 

Will someone come with me so I can order something new and try a bit of yours too?"}
{"text":"Nice Hawaiian vibe. Staff are friendly and efficient. The red velvet pancakes are a must and everything else is average in taste and a staple in breakfast. They offer spam,eggs, and rice. With a few flat screen tv around the small but cute restaurant"}
{"text":"I am a burger junkie. I can eat burgers three meals a day. I had just finished a three day road trip when I stopped at Baby Stacks. I do find it odd that a breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas doesn't open until 7am. Nonetheless I got there at 7 expecting to see the normal breakfast options. I like a simple eggs and bacon. Then I noticed the burger section of the menu. I got a Mushroom Swiss burger. It tasted great! The cheese was smooth an not overpowering. The mushrooms were juicy and the bun was so soft and tasty! The fries were delicious and not greasy. I'm glad this place is so close to my house! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a busy place. What it lacks in room it makes up for in great flavors!

I had the Huevos Rancheros and it was a great way to start the day. 

You may have to wait to get a table, but the quality of the food and the reasonable prices make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"I need to preface this with I don't like breakfast. I never eat breakfast.

Somehow, some friends convinced me to go eat here with them. I had the loco moco with garlic rice. I had dreams about this garlic rice.... like, why am I not eating it right now? 

This place is basically a Hawaiian food / American diner breakfast place. I think I'll try to postmates my meal next time. Overall, if you're in to breakfast, or want some good Hawaiian food the morning after some heavy drinking, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"This is A must for me at least once a week! Huevos rancheros, phenomenal. So many different flavored pancake choices it hard to chose!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for the wait (it was over 20 minutes at 11:30 on a Sunday) but IT IS WORTH THE WAIT! I have been determined to go here after receiving several recommendations and reading reviews. Baby Stacks lives up to all the promises previous patrons have described. 

Realize the name has changed from Baby Cakes to Baby Stacks. We made that mistake and ended up at in Henderson at a bakery inside the M resort.

The red velvet pancakes were worth the wait and worth going back for."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist, but came here since we read the Yelp reviews.  Was not disappointed, and would recommend to everyone in the area.  Pancakes are the specialty of the house, but my omelette was very good."}
{"text":"Great food. Hate the way all baby locations do business. From being greeted by all their rules to the fact they squish everybody in next to each other to their cheap credit card machine that takes forever. Again... Great food."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint. I love hawaiian breakfast! The hawaiian eggs Benedict and Cinnabon pancakes are amazing! The service is great too! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Exceptionally bad service. The only reason I come here is because I cannot find sweet cream crepes anywhere else in town. If it wasn't for that fact I would never come here. On multiple occasions my wife and I have walked into their restaurant only to be given a 25-30 minute wait time to be seated. This would not bother me however there are more empty tables than full tables. It's upsetting because the food here is great. I will not let up on the bad reviews and complaints until the management and host staff is replaced. I will lose this restaurant as much business as possible until the business gets better. 

Here's a tip babystacks...full waiting area+empty tables=no money."}
{"text":"This place has long been on my list, but that being said, I had to muster up the patience to wait in the line everyone talks about.  I'll say we got lucky and only waited 25 mins on a Sunday at around Noon for a table of 4 (and the place probably only seats 30!).  

I ordered the adobo fried rice which sounded good on the menu, but was just 'A-OK', in fact I didn't finish it all.  Disappointed.  It was missing something - more meat, more veggies, more taste overall.  I was tempted, but resisted dousing it with tabasco and shoyu although looking back now, maybe I should've.  Not impressed at all. 

My daughter had the spam scramble and that is right up her alley - she was smiling ear to ear -- scrambled eggs with spam and rice with furikake!  She also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes which were yummy, not memorable yummy, but reorder worthy.  

Friends that were with us ordered the red velvet pancakes which were pretty thick n heavy - if you like them that way, then you'll love these!  The taste was good and the cream cheese syrup was the best part!!  My girlfriend ordered the nutella crepes which we ooo'd and aaah'd about.  She said they were amazing!!

All in all, ok . . . I like the menu, so many choices and everything is just a little bit beyond the norm . . . lots of local favorites and service with a smile which is something I'll come back for.  I was disappointed with the adobo fried rice after all the rave reviews.  Next time, I'm trying the kalua pork eggs benedict - or portuguese sausage breakfast burrito!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were going through Las Vegas trying to hit up all the food places. I usually go for drinking and gambling, so it was nice that I could wake up before 9 AM to try different food places.

We know pancakes can be filling, but we were determined to try the food. So we ordered 2 different pancakes with eggs and bacon. Suffice to say, my wife and I didn't finish our order.

We ordered the red velvet pancakes (so good) and the pecan pancake (can't remember the name). Very satisfied with the meal. We ordered the Portuguese sausage as well. It's good, but it taste pretty much the same as the ones you can buy from the super market."}
{"text":"Service was great! Really nice menu, with a lot of options. I had strawberry pancakes, which were very flavorful. Also had mexican omlette, which had carnitas, jalapenos and pico de gallo. Very good. We love the variety of dishes offered. You can choose to go simple, or can choose something with a little bit of a twist and not be sorry. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Place is the BOMB!!!  Has great food at very reasonable prices.  A must have when you're in the Las Vegas area !"}
{"text":"Fantastic Breakfast restaurant!  The kalua pork Benedict was Devine also the mocha almond pancakes!  Great service, friendly people! My Husband and I will be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"First and for most. It's awful when a breakfast place has crappy tasting coffee. The food portions are sort of small for the price you pay, and this place is super over rated just because, they have \"cool\" pancakes. The space is super cramped. Which makes it hard to get around especially when its packed. The tables are also too damn small. Servers are a hot mess and don't know where to start when it's busy. I waited 20mins to pay! If you just sat a 16top maybe you should ask for some help, and see if another server can check on your tables for you! We never got a water refill and couldn't find a retard to fill it for us! Gah I'm still annoyed thinking about my experience. And it was my 2nd time here thinking ok I'll give it another shot and see what the hype was about. And it ended up being 10x worse than my first experience.   Never again! Can I have my 60$ back please!?!"}
{"text":"Went today for the 1st time and I can tell you that the Red Velvet Pancakes are literally the BEST thing I ever ate.  And I'm a fat girl so you know I speak from experience. 

I have pics but I'm afraid to post them for fear I'll be running back to have more."}
{"text":"Disappointed. First time here was really good tho super crowded. This second time hardly anyone in and the service was meh from the host to the cashier to the speedy Gonzales clearing bus boy. Bathroom floor was wet and sticky. Ew. What of the kitchen?? Then to top it off they take Discover by not Amex? Not coming back to this location. Deleted my bookmark on Yelp and saved location on google maps. The get three stars because of my combined experience from my first time earlier this week and today and that the country Benedict and pancakes are yummy."}
{"text":"Things have gotten better, food is always good just always crowded. Which isn't a bad thing always gotta get that to go."}
{"text":"Let's just say I don't like pancakes and I loved theirs! I wasn't planning to get any but the pictures on yelp looked so good I couldn't resist. The German Chocolate pancakes with bananas are to die for! 10/10 recommend. The service was really attentive as well. Also, for a party of 5, it came out to $60 including tax. Not bad! I'll definitely come back again when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love babystacks because it is convenient and the have really good food I personally think that the senior breakfast is the best and it is for all ages even though it's named SENIOR breakfast I still like it"}
{"text":"After my first visit to the babystacks on Durango and having their strawberry pancakes, I could not get them out of my head and made it a must for us to go to babystacks when I was back in town.

We went to this BabyStacks because it was closer - menu and quality is the same. This time around, my boyfriend got the corned beef hash because he enjoyed it so much when I ordered it last time. And I decided to try the Hawaiian chili loco moco. Although I had intended to reorder a stack of strawberry pancakes as my side (because the strawberry sauce is to die for), I decided to get the hazelnut pancakes with fresh strawberries. My boyfriend got red velvet with his order.

My Hawaiian chili loco moco was delicious, everything was perfectly seasoned. My hazelnut pancakes were a little dry, it wasn't dry enough to make them not taste good, but it kept crumbling every time I tried to pick it up with a fork. The red velvet pancakes were fluffy, the texture reminded me more of a cake than a pancake which made it great!

I love BabyStacks, I just wish they had one in California so I could eat it more often :-("}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and I know a place is good if they can get me craving for more after I finished my meal. 

We chose to eat at Babystacks because it was convenient. My boyfriend and I aren't really pancake people (we prefer savory breakfasts) and had ordered the corned beef hash and the adobo fried rice. I felt like it would have been an injustice to come to babystacks and not try their pancakes, so I asked our server for their most popular pancakes and decided to get the strawberry pancakes to go with my corned beef hash.

I wasn't expecting to really like the pancakes since I normally don't. BUT I ATE ALL OF MY PANCAKES. IT WAS DELICIOUS. It came with fresh cream and strawberries and this strawberry sauce that was addictive. I almost forgot all about my corned beef hash because all I wanted to do was keep eating the pancakes. The corned beef hash was perfect, it had a nice crisp to it and some softness in the middle. I love eating it together where I'm able to get corned beef hash, a little runny yolk, and potatoes all in one spoonful. 

My boyfriend got the adobo fried rice which was served in an omelett. I've never seen that before so I thought it was really creative. It was well-seasoned and yummy.

For a place that we randomly picked, I was thoroughly impressed and we enjoyed everything we ordered. I'm honestly still thinking about those strawberry pancakes."}
{"text":"My entree item:
Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice: \"A traditional Filipino dish with marinated shredded chicken and rice. It is all wrapped in omelette style eggs!\" It definitely is good!
*All entrees come with macaroni, potatoes, or upgrade to the baby stacks.*

I came in a party of twelve today at 9:40 am and it was a packed house! Wait time was about 25 min. 

At the time the a/c was broken, but they advised us before sitting us. It was 86 degrees inside!!! We should've just ate somewhere else at that point. 

PANCAKES: They are great though! It's two slices with most of the flavor on the top piece while the second one is just a plain pancake. (I upgraded to the Red Velvet Pancakes!)"}
{"text":"Was turned onto this place by a friend. We went on a Saturday morning to find a 25 minute wait. I was a little skeptical since breakfast in Vegas is RARELY worth a wait. Once seated was impressed by how fast and friendly everyone was. Wifey tried the Loco Moco with Garlic Rice. This was fantastic, really very good. I tried the Huevos Ranchero with green salsa...damn good. We both shared the Bacon Pancakes, delicious. Coffee was never empty and great. This was worth the wait. Great breakfast spots are hard to find. Will return many times."}
{"text":"Our Services was terrible, the Server Cassandra, so called herself The manager; does not know what the customer service is. This is the worst experience we had eating here. She never attended us or ask us how was everything, not even a greeting smile. Worst of all waited for Water Til the last min, served with our bill. The excuse she gave was she was too busy, can't attended our table. This is a poor excuse, shouldn't be A manager at all if can't handle this Rush hours and can't greet customer with a smile, be presence, it doesn't take an arm or leg to do!!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype on the pancakes!! Worth the 5 mile drive away from the strip for brunch. The wait for 4 was said to be about 45 minutes, but the quick service and efficiency of the kitchen kept the crowd moving and we only waited probably 20 min max. I ordered the banana cream pie pancakes and they were amazing!! Bananas baked into the fluffy pancakes and covered with the thickest, creamiest, and best tasting whipped cream I've ever had. I wish I could have taken that stuff home; it was so good! On my hierarchy of breakfast treats, pancakes land in 3rd behind french toast and waffles, however BabyStacks definitely won me over with these pancakes. Also had a bite of the red velvet (bomb with the cream cheese syrup) and the strawberry (freshest strawberries and hella whipped cream) as well as fries and the garlic fried rice. That fried rice was legit. Definitely on my must visit list when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Everything I order is great. This location only. Highly recommend anything as long as you add the side of seasoned potatoes."}
{"text":"Website says they take to-go orders before 9am on Saturday and Sunday but no one picks up the one before that."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite spot to meet with friends and family for breakfast! The service is impeccable and the food is a beautiful array of classics and orginal modern flair. They also offer you a to-go cup for your beverage when you leave. The hospitality is friendly, but they treat you like family. The Cracked Egg use to be my favorite until these guys came along. A must see and eat!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fantastic fantastic! Great diverse selection of pancakes! Cream cheese syrup is to die for!"}
{"text":"Oh Babystacks.......you never do me wrong. Oh how I love thee....let me count the ways..                                                                                                                                         

1.) Red Velvet Pancakes (Yum!!) - These pancakes are nice and light. Not too heavy. Very flavorful but not too rich where you feel like you would need to drink a gallon of milk. To top off this wonderful dish it comes with a whipped light cream cheese syrup and mini chocolate chips.           

2.) Loco Moco - ( Oh ma gawd!) - This amazing dish is made up of steamed rice, an all beef patty, and eggs served any way with brown gravy on top. So magical. All the flavors blended together very well. The only thing I don't like about this dish is the macaroni salad that comes with it. No flavor. Maybe you could substitute the salad with some fruit?                                                                                                                            

3.) LJ's  Scramble - (Kids dish) - This dish is on the kids menu. I think they give a nice size portion for the price. It comes with a scrambled egg, sausage or bacon, hash browns (which is enough for my daughter and I to share) and 1 baby stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Baby stacks is known for their gourmet style pancakes. They have several different options to choose from such as s'more, lemon ricotta, carrot cake, Rocky road, cinnabon, and bacon. If I could ever get out of my comfort zone, step out of the box and try something new, I would like to try these other pancakes. They sound wonderful! I will also need to try the Kaluha pig Benedict or spinach Benedict. I hear these dishes are tasty as well?   Baby stacks has two locations. I live closer to this location (smoke ranch) but I think the one off of Flamingo is bigger? You definitely want to get to either location early because there can be somewhat of a wait. I am a fan though and find myself going at least 1-2 times a month."}
{"text":"Incredibly wide range of breakfast foods! We tried the red velvet pancakes and the cream was among the best whipped creams that I have ever had. On top of that, the pancakes were delicious!"}
{"text":"I am still drooling when I recall those signature pancakes. This place is bomb for breakfast. We ended up here because of random circumstances, but I absolutely loved their pancakes. The only drawback is that they are VERY sweet. So you must be ok with very sweet breakfast food. If you happen to be in the area, come here and get those signature red velvet pancakes!"}
{"text":"Mediocre overpriced food...charged me .70 for a side of hot sauce. Why stop there...you should charge for fork rental too"}
{"text":"It was okay. No big wait but I had a groupon deal. I wouldn't go back unless I had another. And even then if I saw another groupon I probably wouldn't bother buying it. The food was nothing to rave about. It was just blah."}
{"text":"Came here with a huge appetite, and did this place ever satiate that need. I ordered a simple egg and bacon breakfast. The eggs, over easy and cooked perfectly. This time I didn't order any pancakes because I wasn't in the mood for anything sweet. The orange juice was good too. :P 
There was a good wait, and I'm actually glad I had the patience and waited. The service was really good, polite and very attentive. Drinks always full and our every need met. I would recommend coming here at least once.
The restrooms and restaurant is clean, busy but it's all good."}
{"text":"The wait here was about  30-40 minutes on a Friday morning but well worth it . We were seated and it  took a while for us to decide so I think our waiter forgot about us so someone else was kind enough to take our order . I ordered Lolos adobo fried rice and it was yummy . I got a side of mac and German chocolate pancakes to go . Hubby got Lola's corned beef hash and he said it was ok but he did like his Nutella pancakes . My little one got the kids breakfast with an egg , sausage and hash and an Oreo pancake which he polished off in a matter of minutes . My other boy got a 2 egg , sausage and hash brown plate with 2 bacon pancakes which took a very long time to come . I think when they made the pancakes they forgot to add the bacon so they ended up sprinkling the bacon on top . Nevertheless , he liked it . My other son got the 6 s'mores pancakes which he liked . Everything was yummy and we will definitely make this one of our stops every time we are in the area ."}
{"text":"Great place for pancakes but the place is small and you can't wait up to an hour easy if you don't get there at the right time. That's why 4/5. Get the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Service was very fast and friendly. Food came out in about 7-10 mins. I ordered the Lola omelette with fried rice. I have to admit I had something totally different in mind when it came out. It is so filled with rice its not fried more like wet. Mush with the adobo and minuscule amount of chicken. I upgraded to the garlic rice which is just a waste. 3 stars because service was good. Thanks Ariana for taking care of us. Mostly likely sticking to normal breakfast for awhile."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Babycakes for awhile now. We finally got the chance to on a Sunday morning with another couple who has been to Babycakes before. There was a \"40\" minute wait, but it was more like a \"20\" minute wait, which was good for this starving girl.

Our friends ordered the Mexican Omelet and the Kahlua Pork Benedict. I ordered the Corned Beef and Hash and the fiancé ordered the Rick's Adobo  Fried Rice. I ordered the blueberry pancakes on the side with my order and my friend ordered the banana pancakes. (Yes, I didn't try the Red Velvet Pancakes only because I'm not that big of a fan of it). My corned beef and hash was cooked very nicely. It was crispy but moist all in one. Seasoned potatoes were a lil dry, but a lil over medium egg yolk solved that problem. I also tried the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. What an awesome concept....eggs and fried rice in one. Yum! My pancakes.....well I don't think anything can beat my light fluffy blueberry pancakes from Maui....so that was a bust for me.

Overall, service was good, we all left full and plates were emptied. We will be back and maybe next time I'll try these Red Velvet Pancakes."}
{"text":"I would definitely give it 3.5 stars. At first I was in love with the red velvet pancakes so we would come here quite often. For a breakfast joint it is definitely hopping so you want to get here earlier if possible. I always tend to order the same things when I go to breakfast. In this case, the corned beef hash is my go to. The corned beef hash is nothing to write home about I guess. It kind of looks like the stuff from the can so sometimes it doesn't look the most appetizing or appealing. The taste is hit or miss as are the potatoes. Of course the saving grace is always the pancakes which I definitely like the red velvet or the blueberry. The last couple of times I decided to just order to go, because it is easier with a toddler in tow and I really just wanted pancakes. The blueberry pancakes were good, but there were barely any blueberries. I do like that they put fresh blueberries on top, but the ratio of blueberries to batter should be a bit more than what I've seen lately. Overall, breakfast items are decent, but their winners are their pancakes. 

P.S. They do a really good job packing to go orders with foil lined boxes so it stays hot on the way home!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the red velvet pancakes...and they should!  They are truly amazing. They have a slightly crusty outside and the middle is moist and not too sweet. It's served with this thick glaze that you pour over it in lieu of regular syrup. Oh my!  It doesn't get much better than that!!  

The coffee was perfect with the pancakes. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is the service was a little lacking. They didn't seem to be all that busy but it took a while to get out order and the coffee refills didn't come around as much as I would have liked. I've been there a couple of times on different days of the week so I'm not sure why the service was just so so. I'll tell you what though, the red velvet pancakes makes it worth your wait!  Go there, NOW!"}
{"text":"I love babystacks I always go to the original location in Summerlin they have the best service there and should've just gone there instead. Never coming back to this location again after our experience . Yes, there's a lot of people, it's busy... BUT that doesn't give you an excuse to be rude and inattentive to your customers. Our server took 15 min to get us a drink and another five to get our orders... Once he did get our orders all of our orders were incorrect! A simple sorry about that would've sufficed BUT he managed to say are you sure you didn't order that?.... Like BRO... I ordered Portuguese sausage, rice, over medium eggs, with pancakes .... and he gave me the sausage, seasoned potatoes,scrambled eggs and toast... instead of apologizing he was just like so you changed your mind on the toast..? NO. I never ordered it.. and he was telling me that wasn't what he wrote down.. Well OBVIOUSLY you were not paying attention and didn't care much for good service...he apologizes after hearing me make a comment about him claiming we ordered what he wrote. To put the cherry on top
of this horrific service he managed to put 3 drinks that we didn't order on the bill...... The cashier asks us if we wanted to add tip ... the answer is a big NO. I'm usually a good tipper but with that service he was lucky we didn't walk out... Amazing food won't keep customers coming back if your service is horrible and unprofessional. I did not expect a 5 star dining experience here but I also did expect attentiveness, and a little bit of courtesy.... SMH."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! 
I've been to the Stephanie location & Blue Diamond location.
Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice is amazing!
Try the Red Velvet and Cookies & Cream pancakes!"}

{"text":"Very long wait ...... Really the only negative ( maybe that is actually a positive:) ). 
Decor not inviting BUT I brought 6  girls here and they all said their food was delicious!!!! Everyone wants to return."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Babystacks. We were lucky enough to score some seats at the breakfast bar, so we didn't have to brave a wait. I'd like to start by mentioning that this spot is very family friendly. Which I love. We were greeted by our server and he quickly served us our coffee.  () We had strawberry pancakes which were delicious. My daughter got buttermilk pancakes which were also super tasty. I'm personally not huge on sweet breakfasts, but I can honestly say I really enjoyed tasting their sweet treats. 

I ordered the breakfast burrito and replaced the meat with refried beans. I choose the green salsa to go with my burrito, and seasoned potatoes as my side. Let me just tell you guys- the burrito exceeded my expectations. It was super delicious. The green salsa is literal perfection. Seriously, I wanted to drink it. Okay, not really- but I actually ordered another side of it so that I could put it over my seasoned potatoes. 
If you order more of a savory breakfast I highly suggest ordering it with the green salsa! 

The service was prompt, the staff is friendly, and the food did not disappoint. We will absolutely be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Per our friends' and Yelpers' suggestions we went with the most popular items. See: FOMO. 

Red Velvet Pancakes: so good and not just because it's sweet, but because the sweet is a delicious one. It's that white cream sauce on top, better than any syrup could ever imagine, a gourmet cupcake kind of delectable in the simplest vanilla cream. I can definitely understand the hype with this dish. If not for taste, it's in the sizing. I could not finish off the huge saucers on my own. 

Eggs Benedict: well, it's what you'd expect, it's great, but in hindsight now, boring. 

Adobo Fried Rice Omelette: I would go back for this dish. I liked it that much and it's worthy to note that I normally don't care for adobo at all. Being from Hawaii, pork or chicken adobo, especially filipino adobo, is everywhere, but not on my radar. This, however, could've changed my life growing up. 

On that note: Do locals run this place? I got that vibe. The food and setting are a little more diner feeling to me than cafe, though. Not a complaint."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The pancakes taste great but are not fluffy at all. Don't expect good service wheb you come here."}
{"text":"Love this place! The menu has a lot on it, and not just typical breakfast stuff. Has a lot of unique things. Had an awesome breakfast skillet with fresh (so good) salsa. Everyone in the family was happy with this place. Love the family feel too."}
{"text":"YUMMY! A great place to go for red velvet pancakes.  Also a great place to go for filipino breakfast dishes.

Both are great.  My new favorite spot for breakfast in Las Vegas.

The red velvet pancakes weren't too sweet so that you couldn't finish the whole thing.  The filipino breakfast I got was delicious.  Service is good, food is good, prices is good, plenty of parking.  

Five stars for BabyStacks Cafe!"}
{"text":"I am giving only 3 stars because the other 2 people I was with did not like their breakfast. I had the short stake of Red Velvet Pancakes, and they were wonderful and I can't wait to have them again. One of breakfast companions ordered the \"homemade\" corned beef hash & eggs medium with toast. The hash looked like dog food that came out of a can and the eggs were runny, the toast was so dry. He said it was one of the worst breakfast's he has had. The other person upgraded their pancakes to Banana, but was brought regular instead. Waitress never asked if we needed more hot water for our tea. Another thing that drives me crazy is the 2 tables we had pushed together were 2 different heights and 1 of them wobbled like crazy. Some of the other tables were the same way. I will go back, but my 2 friends will not."}
{"text":"My good friend and I always head here when the \"out to breakfast\" big takes us over. All the unique flavors and slight island flare makes this little morning spot hard to beat. I love their German chocolate pancakes when I'm fighting the sweet tooth, the lemon ricotta when I want to be a little more tame. But let me tell you GARLIC RICE!!! Oh my, sooo good and so much garlic!!!! I will never say no to These babies!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, food was incredible.  we had the red velvet pancakes. Perfectly sweet and airy.  I also had the eggs Benedict with pork which was also amazing.  The pork was tender and juicy.  They were running behind and had lots of customers.  They were so kind they gave us a discount on our bill since we waited forever.  Awesome customer service.

Very happy with my choice, and there are LOTS of options for breakfast. I would come back to try the pancakes for sure, there were so many goodies on the menu I'm sure almost anyone could find something they would enjoy here."}

Breakfast served fast and hot. 
Enjoyed my Saturday morning here."}
{"text":"Overall, great food! Should've ordered sausage patties instead of links, but my meal was delicious! I tried the red velvet pancakes and they were scrumptious! A bit on the sweet side, which I love, but next time I'll try the T bone steak and just regular pancakes ... Or maybe the banana cream short stack? I don't know, everything looks pretty tasty on the menu! Staff were friendly, my family and I came on a Friday around 11 am and it was packed, no wait though, and staff were hustling and bustling so we left a generous tip for our waitress :)"}
{"text":"I randomly found this place while I was in Vegas. I woke up early and decided to find a breakfast place with the people I was with. The thing that drew me to this place was the Red Velvet Pancakes. 

This place was fabulous. I gave them two thumbs up when I saw that they served Spam & Eggs. The red velvet pancakes was good. I also tried the lemon riccotta pancakes and they were good and light. It sound good right now as I'm writing. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Must eat the red velvet pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"If your into pancakes then I'm sure this is your place.  I am not one of those people.  I have become a breakfast person recently, so I have been going out of my way to go to different breakfast spots.  And that quest brought me to Babycakes.  

It's a pretty small place, but was quite busy.  The service was quick for what it seems to be a understaffed establishment.  The food is normal breakfast fair.  I did try the buttermilk pancakes and they were o.k.  But like I stated before I am not a pancake person, so maybe this isn't the place for me.  I will maybe come back to try some of the Hawaiian food I saw on the menu and that's about it."}
{"text":"small place & weekends have a long wait after 10 . Worth the wait for the red velvet pancakes :) yum yum yum topped with whipped cream and small chocolate chips"}
{"text":"Everything here is so good! Fresh and clean! Coffee is yummy! I just wished they would expand. All Babystacks should be a whole lot bigger so that they can accommodate more at a time and lessen the wait time. But the food is so good, people like me are willing to wait. Hehe! Good job to the owners!"}

{"text":"Not sure if it was the cook today or because I ordered out but I was disappointed. This was our first time eating here and saw how good the reviews were/live down the street and wanted breakfast food. Ordered blueberry pancakes and hash browns. The pancakes fell short. Tasted as if they drowned it in butter while cooking all while bland at the same time (butter isn't a replacement for sugar). Hash browns were hard around the edges and not seasoned at all. My boyfriend's red velvet pancakes were pretty good. Just super bummed they didn't live up to the hype. Overall, I'll pass."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I've been to Babystacks, but I've tried just about every single pancake and all of them have been great. Naturally some are better than others and the Red Velvet pancakes never fail to disappoint. The Carrot Cake and White Chocolate Macadamia round out the top three.
Also their hash browns and breakfast potatoes are pretty great. I've only done breakfast here, I can't speak for their lunch food."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Had the BYO omelet with Portuguese sausage. A little on the salty side but still good. Bacon pancakes were dry and the bacon wasn't cooked into the batter as described in the menu. Service was... let's just say a guy took our order, twice, and still got it wrong. His hair was on point though. He must love Mario bros. Take this review for what it's worth from the opinion of one guy. Like I always tell myself, give any place at least one chance."}

{"text":"Friday morning, was really packed---we waited a bit for a table to open up, but singles or couples got seating right away. I liked the long wooden bench in the front. Comfy, could seat many people. Service was very good, everyone's really nice and attentive. 

This was our first visit here (Babies R Us/ shopping center), but we've been to their other location (4 total in the valley BTW). I had been looking over their menu since the real first visit, and was really wanting to try their \"local favorite\" Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice (egg burrito) and the red velvet pancakes seemed very enticing. What the hell, right? We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. Our son had his favorite, sausage links. I didn't get a hot chocolate because I knew breakfast was going to be big. And it was delicious, we split each item, our favorite thing to do.

My husband asked me if it was authentic, and it definitely was (I don't eat filipino food as much because (1) my lola was a really good cook and because of that (2) I am really picky with it. Besides, it is usually high in fat, calories & sodium, too. 5 days a week I am on a restricted diet.) The adobo flavor was perfect (not too much of one ingredient like vinegar), the twist was adding rice, and placing it all inside an egg wrapper which ends up looking like a burrito, mmm, it was hella good or masarap. Hubby liked it so much would conside getting the same, but me being curious, would like to try the loco moco."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Inspired by a meeting with my husband's relatives on their quick visit (that was so nice to see them) recently for breakfast at the Blueberry Hill (yum!) on Flamingo/Tamarus, I wanted to go out for breakfast on my birthday (a few days ago) and scoped out a few places (1) thanks to Yelp, (2) remembered this place, a few months back, from a benefit segment on the news and (3) may have heard about their best seller, Red Velvet Pancakes from a local radio show hostess (we hardly go out for breakfast, but I miss it). I am always checking out menus (but changed my mind on my choice---this menu has a ton of options) and since I'm on a restricted diet, look forward to eating a little more freely on my cheat days. 

This is located in a small strip mall, corner pocket, and is a bit small, but it feels cozy and it is clean---turnaround time is fast because this is a popular breakfast spot (counted about 13 tables, booth and table/chair combos, with the booth side against the walls); not quite, a hole-in-the-wall. My son noticed the giant butterflies on the wall, by stating \"Big bugs!\" There were two tv's on opposite ends of the L-shaped restaurant. When we arrived, it was quiet, and many tables were empty. By the time we left, there was only one empty table, two tables if you count ours. When you walk in, there is the cashier (where you pay), and  the menu is posted on the wall at eye-level height (for me anyway, I'm short). 

Our server was Monica, and she was super sweet, outgoing, and helpful (suggestions) when we had questions about the menu. She was also pretty attentive, checking on us many times. 

My husband got the german chocolate pancakes, the full stack. It was huge! It looked really decadent and more like a dessert. I had one, the little guy had half of one, and we took one and a half to-go. It was really good, light and fluffy, but very sweet (caramel sauce), so it's not something I would get (I don't have a sweet tooth). My husband loves his pancakes, but when we go again, said he would get the short stack with a side of something salty, sausage or something. Even the guy next to him (got the build your own omelet) was looking at it when it was brought to our table. I got the biscuits and gravy with two sausage links, and it came with my choice of potatoes, I got them seasoned. The gravy was very good, and the biscuits were soft (four). Little man liked the sausage and potatoes. I was going to get the adobo fried rice (that was my 1st choice), but opted for a less heavy item because lunch was going to be AYCE sushi, and I really didn't want to spoil my lunch (balance). I really enjoyed the hot chocolate, sprinkled with bits of chocolate (didn't melt), mmm. I would definitely get that again. It was full of flavor, not watered down, and most likely the best cup of hot chocolate I ever had, and when I told my husband, he said \"You downed it quick, someone didn't even offer me a sip\" My oops. If we go to a new place, I try to check out other people's food (but I'm not a neck-stretcher), to see how they look, and also portion size. Someone next to us got the red velvet pancakes and they looked decadent. 

I will definitely try something different next time. Hubby said we could always go out for breakfast and eat in for lunch or dinner, just to switch it off, and that way we could enjoy breakfast out sometime (he is the breakfast maker in our home). 

There are four locations, two on the west side (summerlin, spring valley), one in the centennial area, and henderson. 

To reiterate, a popular breakfast spot (all the reviews on Yelp, c'mon!), nice staff/very good service, great food, and definitely one place to meet out of town guests for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place!  A wonderful find while visiting Las Vegas.  Great service...great food!"}
{"text":"A crafty take on a cornerstone of American breakfast cuisine that too often becomes tiresome.

The shining star of the menu is of course, their pancakes. And deservingly so. They come out hot, moist and delightfully soft. Soft enough you do not need a knife to cut them, as all good pancakes shouldn't. Aside from the texture, the innovative spins they have in their recipes (Cinnabun, orange creamsicle, PB and ?) tie them together in an extremely palatable and delicious experience. Boyfriend had rocky road, I enjoyed the hazelnut myself. Both were delish!

As it was pushing into lunch time we also ordered a kalua grilled cheese and an eggs benedict. The grilled cheese deserved a 4/5 in terms of tastefulness and innovation. The benedict I found a little bland in flavor and too reminiscent of many other breakfast joints in town. 

Service was an A+. Seated at approximately the given wait time, staff was very friendly and attentive.

Altogether a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It's a fusion breakfast place and you have your choice between sweet or savory. We usually go with the savory! Pancakes of different varieties, spam, eggs, and more :)

Adobo fried rice and Kalua Pig Benidect. I'm not really a fan of hollandaise but for some reason theirs, I like! My husband usually gets the adobo fried rice and it's pretty good too.

I can't really ingest sweets like I used to but every once in awhile we'll share a short stack of pancakes and we're never disappointed. One thing that I wish they had is more of a selection of fresh juices. I'm not even sure if the juice that they offer is actually fresh?

Love this place. 

The End."}
{"text":"Overall the food is pretty good ... I've been to Babystacks three times now, and consistently they have had service issues to where all the food, particularly pancakes and toast, is not served until after we have finished our meal or even forgotten ... The joy of pancakes is eating them in combination with the savory taste of eggs and bacon ... We had lemon ricotta and blue berry and there were only 2 blue berries in the small stack. The restaurant has some work to do in terms of their food processes during busy mornings to ensure the dining experience is not frustrating."}
{"text":"I came here ready to stuff my face with the glories of awesomeness. Yeah, I think I went a bit overboard, but it's okay. I can always start dieting tomorrow. 

Red velvet pancakes- 5 stars. I still drool thinking about this pancake, because it's like eating cake but in pancake form. The texture is more like a muffin cake rather than a chewy pancake, but it's SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD. For a sweet tooth like myself, this is heavenly. 

Adobo fried rice omelet - 4 stars. The flavoring inside with the rice and adobo is good. I think it could have been a bit saltier, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a fried rice rather than in an omelet since the egg outside dilutes the saltiness inside, making it a bit bland for my taste. I was confused if I'm supposed to put ketchup outside and eat it or should it have been tonkatsu sauce? Maybe that would be more genius. 

Side of portugese sausage- 4 stars. Who don't like sausage? OINK OINK. My belly does. I'm no Portuguese sausage connoisseur, but I love a fatty polska kielbasa and this sausage did the job. 

Some healthy bacon and all kinds of stuff omelet with avocado on top- 4 stars. I never order omelets at restaurants, because I can make a pretty legit version in my own kitchen. SO, I don't know what to say and how to rate this omelet. It was good, but not something I'd order. 

I'm coming back for VELVET PANCAKES!!! WOOOOOO!

Service- 7/5 stars. It's off the charts. I can't even believe how fast my water was filled at quarter point every time. The dude was working real hard and he deserves major credit for it. Stellar service for sure from start to beginning."}
{"text":"I had the Huntington Omelet, so good~ Egg was fluffy with the avocado, hmmm~ The Staff was really nice and helpful.  It was my first time to visit BabyStacks"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while since I had seen so many good reviews. I had also seen reviews that said the service was not that great. When I arrived the place was completely full but I was by myself and only needed to wait approximately 2 minutes for them to clean a table and accommodate me. I asked for a coffee and it took a couple of minutes to arrive but after that the service was more than adequate. I ordered a bacon cheese and avocado omelette and I also ordered bananas Foster pancakes. Both were very good and my overall experience was very good as well."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.  We arrived around 8 am on last Saturday..no wait.  Good timing...there was a steady stream of customers while we ate.  Our server was super sweet and attentive.  I had the bacon and eggs, with an upgrade to the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  The BF had the Piglet Skillet.  Boy, do you get your money's worth!!!  The breakfast potatoes were crispy, perfectly seasoned and delicious.  The Lemon Ricotta pancakes were perfect compliment - not too heavy, leaning towards a delicious crepe.  We both had food to take home but it didn't last - we ate the leftovers before lunch (we were organizing the garage and needed the carbs!)  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried their Steak and Eggs with Garlic Rice. It was delicious. My boys love the chocolate pancakes with a side of bacon and hot chocoate. It's a small restaurant so it gets super busy. Be prepared to wait if you get their during lunchtime."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE the adobo fried rice! The place is small and always packed, but the servers always know when you need something lol"}
{"text":"This is based on my first visit. I was very happy. I brought my 2 kids who are 7 and 5. This place is very kid friendly. 5 minute wait, but it was a weekday afternoon.  This place is not that big, so I can see a wait being an issue if it was busy and if you were a party over 4 there is really only one table that you can be sat at. We ordered S'mores, Cinnamon pancakes and Spinach Benedict with fruit. Everything was delicious. Service is excellent. I like how you just pay at the register. Great pancake place. I am actually sad that it is a 30 minute drive for me."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in all of Las Vegas. Maybe the state. Possibly the country. The service, the food, the ambiance is outstanding every time I go in. Pancakes tried: Red velvet, orange creamsicle, Easter special ( Cadbury egg batter with toasted coconut and whip cream on top), Cookie butter French toast, and sweet cream crepes. All fantastic. Red velvet pancakes are a must have! And the cookie butter French toast is the guilty pleasure of the century. Entrees tried: Spam scramble is decent. Spam sliders are delicious with Hawaiian sweet rolls layered with a spam scramble and your choice of cheese. Pick cheddar. And make sure to get furikake seasoning on EVERYTHING. It makes the dish 10x better. Kalua pig Benedict is not as good as it sounds. No flavor with a ton of carbs. If you're torn, pick the adobo fried rice omelette (substitute rice for garlic rice, add furikake seasoning) and the cookie butter French toast. Your tastebuds will thank you. It will be so good you'll come back to try the rest of the menu. Babystacks you have my heart... And my hips :')"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone thinks this is the greatest.  I liked the location and the interior.  Everyone was nice and we enjoyed ourseves.  But, my pancakes were not done inside and still doughy.  Also, I expressly said please cook the egg so the whites are not runny but the whites were still runny.  This is basic stuff  Coffee was served often but was weak.  My buddy's pancakes were fine.  

I would try it again for lunch as they all seem nice and seem like they are trying hard but my meal needed some quality control.  I hope it gets better and Vegas needs more good local places and less chains."}
{"text":"I have been delaying my 200th review...

Why????

My 200th review need to be amazing, needed to be mind blowing, needed to be inspiring and of course needed to be just.... awesome.  I am not talking about my actual review of course, but of the place that I am reviewing.  

Babycakes is worth my 200th slot and my 300th and my 400th and so on.

It is that good.

I was visiting Las Vegas from Houston a few weeks back and my family and I wanted to go get some fantastic breakfast.  My fellow yelpers told me to try this place out and after reading the reviews, I decided it was worth the try and the drive from our hotel.

After a bit of complaining from my family as we drove there and found a bit of a wait, the complaining stopped the second they took a bite out of their omelet.  The four of us go different omelets and I decided to get the Macadamia Nut pancakes with my omelet.  

\"BEST OMELET I HAVE EVER EATEN!!!\" - Family

\"........mmmmmm.......\" - Me

I am having trouble finding the words to describe the food they have here.  Everything is amazing and the pancakes were RIDICULOUS!!  

For example, the food was so good I ended up buying one of their mugs.  Their little Babycake mugs.  Just so I will have a memento of my favorite breakfast place on earth.

Thanks right

MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE ON EARTH!!!!!!

I feel like going to Vegas, but only for the Babycakes.

Peace"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I gave this place a try last weekend after hiking in the Red Rock Canyons. We have been trying to eat somewhat healthy, and this showed up under a search for 'healthy breakfast' haha well after reading about red velvet pancakes, all bets were off. We turned on the GPS and headed over.

We waited for quite awhile, probably a half hour or so, because of the fact that it was Saturday at around 11:30. We really hit the rush because right when we sat down, like four or five tables got up and they didn't get re-seated (do we stink or something!?)

The menu looked INCREDIBLE. Banana cream pie pancakes, carrot cake pancakes, orange creamsicle pancakes, SMORES pancakes, and I believe cookies and cream pancakes (there were plenty others but these stuck out to me). We had choice overload, because every single one sounded unbelievable. Since we also read about the homemade corned beef hash, I also wanted to try that.

We ended up getting the meal that comes with eggs, corned beef hash, and a couple of pancakes, and ordering a separate short stack as well. We got the short stack of red velvet, and the other 2 were banana cream pie.

Well, first, the corned beef hash was FANTASTIC. I would come back just to have that for breakfast again. For some reason I was craving it, and man did it hit the spot. 

The red velvet pancakes were probably the best I ever had, and mostly because of the creamcheese sauce they put on top. If I wasn't 'eating healthy' I would have asked for some extra, because that would have made it the best thing in the whole world.

The banana cream pie ones were also really good, but my girlfriend felt they tasted a bit too artificial. I personally really liked them. 

The bill was something like 20 bucks, and for 2 people including coffees, we were more than happy with that. The two woman that were at the front were also really friendly, and chatted with us about our experience afterwards.

Great value, great breakfast, and incredible pancakes. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I was sincerely excited to try Baby Stacks this morning, we put our name down and waited about 30 minutes. We noticed some people who came after us were seated before us. My boyfriend went in and asked and they sat us down instantly. Once we sat down the waitress passed us twice. No greeting or \"I'll be with you shortly\" I understand it's busy but customer service is customer service. All customers should get equal amount of great service. The woman finally came up to us. I asked her about how they made oatmeal and she said it was instant and I replied \" instant oatmeal for five dollars!\" She got offended and made a passive aggressive gesture. I told her we needed a minute and we decided to leave. I will not be returning due to bad customer service"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not memorable. Three different kinds of pancakes and all melded together. Denver scramble was okay."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and my last. We arrived at 8am to a 25 minute wait, im thinking this place must be awesome. I kept things basic and ordered a short stack of buttermilk pancakes. I was disappointed when my rather thin pancakes  were placed before me with a plastic cup of syrup and a pat of hard butter  in a foil wrapper. The pancakes were like rubber, requiring a fork and knife to cut them and slightly  warmed over. I ate 1/2 of one and my husband tried the other half. I left the others on the plate.  My husband ordered the basic bacon and eggs. His eggs were cold, English  muffin barely toasted. Nothing to see here, move along......"}
{"text":"Great spot to hit for breakfast or brunch. Skillets or pancakes are awesome..service is always amazing! Deffo a regular spot for me"}
{"text":"As with John M., I am very stingy with my 5-star reviews. But nobody likes a liar, so I had to be honest and give this place its proper due.

Went with a large party, as a group we ordered nearly half the items on the menu, and then I stuffed my mouth with (stole) off every single plate that hit the table-- it was all amazing. I had the portuguese sausage and eggs with a short stack of red velvet pancakes (I could drink the CREAM CHEESE SYRUP by itself). 

Pros: HUGE variety, so many creative pancake choices (red velvet, carrot cake, white choc macadamia nut, rockry road), clean environment, trendy (yet unassuming) atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, reasonable prices.

Cons: They don't have a location in Southern California."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Loved the music would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting"}
{"text":"I love Babystacks and have gone to many of their locations for a few years now but I will not be going back to this location. They were full on a Sunday, as usual and service was beyond slow and lacking. There were so many employees \"working\" yet nothing seemed to be getting done. With tables in close proximity you can hear EVERYTHING, even every mistake and forgotten item by the server from the guests. There were multiple bussers standing around watching the football game while there were dirty tables everywhere with guests waiting to be sat and when they did start cleaning tables took forever to clean and would drop things on the floor without picking it up, had inappropriate conversations with each other while using foul language right in earshot of guests, servers on their cell phones behind the counter, drinks unfilled... or no drinks all together, 3 hosts standing around chit chatting with each other. 

I am a restaurant manager and see past most things and even give excuses but on this occasion, I cannot. If I were the owner, I'd want to know! Gave me anxiety just being there for 45 mins. With this location being so close to home and being so new, it's a shame. I will make the extra 20-25 minute drive to go to their other location or to another breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed! Service is sometimes slow only because they're always so busy but they're friendly so to me it doesn't matter! Food is fantastic especially the Nutella pancakes!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is an amazing cafe! I come here every weekend with my family :,) it is an astonishing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Everything is awesome here! Adobo fried rice is amazing and the crepes and pancakes are to die for. Sometimes there's a wait for a table, deal with it! Totally worth it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!!! Amanda was our server and she was the nicest, attentive server I have ever had! You can tell she loves what she does. She always had a smile on her face with every customer!!! She was awesome!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in with a huge group and got taken care of quickly, food was delicious as usual!!!!! Great customer service."}
{"text":"While the red velvet pancakes were really good, I personally liked the Cinnabon-like pancakes a bit better. Try the Portuguese sausage (with a little kick to boot!) as well. Pefect and delicious contrast to the sweet 'cakes"}
{"text":"We drove across town to have breakfast here and it was worth it. Loved the red velvet pancakes! Limited seating so expect a wait. Service was friendly. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is amazing breakfast joint!! We had the breakfast burrito and biscuits and gray with the butter milk pancake!! This is from Hawaii style food as well highly recommend"}
{"text":"Babystacks one of my favorite favorite breakfast places!!!!!!! We are always seated fast, food comes out on descent time and no problems with their service. Their menu is great with a lot to choose from. Their pancakes are a must try!!! I've gone to both locations Centennial and Henderson a couple times and I have no complains. :)"}
{"text":"Thought I'd take a slow down in my hussle bussle of a life and have me a nice sit down early breakfast. A few co-workers of mine told me of this place called BabyStacks Cafe. Not to bad of a little cafe, but that was the only bad part... It was a VERY little cafe. Maybe about 7 or 8 seats. Don't get me wrong, the food was stupendous.The skillets are amazing and the red velvet pancakes are heaven on earth, just wish the cafe was a little bit bigger. I felt as if I was literally rubbing elbows with my stranger of a neighbor. I like roominess when I eat."}
{"text":"I have been coming to babystacks for the past 6 years. Recently babystacks made a change in policy where you cannot split checks. I can't begin to explain the inconvenience this caused the party I was with. On top of that, I drive 25 minutes to this location because I've always had a good experience and the food is great. But another reason is because it is military friendly. Today Krissy told my entire military party that she couldn't give us military discount because they had already gave us our check, although we hadn't even paid yet. I'm not looking for a handout but I will always support a small business, especially if they're military friendly. Not splitting our check is inconvenient and annoying, but to then deny military discount because we didn't announce we were military before ordering food is absolutely absurd. Again, I have been coming to various Las Vegas babystacks locations, but this was the last time and I will not return again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They have a stupid policy that doesnt allow them to seat incomplete parties. This was my first time coming here. I arrived with my daughter and said we had 5 altogether. They said I had to wait til all were there at first and I was fine with that. My sister and her boyfriend arrived 5 mins later and I said we were ready. The waitress replied \"So theres only 4 people now?\" I said no my brother is parking. Instead of seating us she said they could not seat us until ALL were there. Today is THANKS GIVING and the restaurant was half empty with NO LINE. Being in an industry that deals mainly with customer service I understand their are certain policies all companies have but there is COMMON SENSE when to bend the rules. 

For being a smaller cafe they sure can't afford to deny business especially for only being a local spot. They have 2 signs which were pretty negative from the get.

1. Be nice or leave
2. We can't sit incomplete parties.
(Which is understandable is they were BUSY)

Both signs just deny business. Morons!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes and friendly people. The variety of pancakes are delicious. If you're  in Vegas, definitely check this place out. The potatoes are so good too."}
{"text":"food: adobo fried rice. it's ok... nothing special about it. it's not packed with flavor as i have hoped. it was bland and didnt have much to offer. my friends ordered the loco moco and that was great. another ordered the eggs benedict and it was delicious. ***3/5

service: the place was busy, but service was fairly quick. so many people around but our server was quick to get us whatever we needed. ***4/5

value: the portion of the food was big, but bigger portions to ok food is whatever. what i ordered wasnt that great, but the food i did try from my friends were decent. they have potential. ***3/5"}
{"text":"I know most people come for the pancakes but I come for the Hawaiian breakfast. I love Hawaiian food!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a menu full of diabetes stop here. They don't really have healthy options and the pancakes aren't very good for a place called Bandstand. I wouldn't eat here twice in a lifetime."}
{"text":"Babystacks is definitely our favorite breakfast spot.  So glad to have one closer to home, AND the execution is on par with the other locations we frequent.  Also glad to see small business succeed in Vegas.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We had some excellent cookie & cream pancakes. Along with Spam & Fried Rice, buttermilk pancakes and a breakfast burrito. Everything was super!  Friendly server too."}
{"text":"The food here is undoubtedly good. For the most part, It is just your standard breakfast fare. The pancakes are delicious and creative, but a lot of places have delicious and creative pancakes. You will never show up here and not have to wait a minimum of 30 minutes for a table, so the sole reason that I suffer the wait is that it's the only place I can get garlic rice. And it's GOOD garlic rice. Today I joined a few friends for brunch. We met at 12:30, were seated around 1, and unfortunately got the table next to the window. And the air conditioning was apparently broken. It was 108 outside and at least 150 inside. At one point, Satan stopped by our table to ask how the food was. Ok, I may have hallucinated the Satan part, as I was in full on heat stroke. It was difficult to enjoy the meal with all the sweat that was dripping into it. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the employees back in the hot kitchen. In the Las Vegas summer, you have to put more effort into temperature control. If I'm waiting 30 minutes for a table, I expect you're bringing in enough revenue to invest in a couple fans at least. I don't feel so well after sitting there sweating."}
{"text":"What can i said this place is awesome the service is good and the pancakes are the best i have in my life, what a great place to start your day. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love love love! How can you go wrong with Portuguese sausage, rice, eggs, and red velvet pancakes for breakfast??? My family and I love the island options on the menu. Restaurant is smaller and there is always a wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Babystacks' 5th location!  They must be doing something right... Something. 

Monkey do:  

HUNTINGTON OMELET- bacon avocado cheddar & pico de gallo $9.5
PB & BANANA (2) $1.5
COFFEE $2

Sad omelet was eggs stuffed with bacon, cheese on top and slivers of avocado to decorate. Pico de gallo helped, but meh. Pancakes are dense and needed the huge water cup given. Peanut butter chips sweetened and provided most of flavor.  What a waste of time and money. Monkey make better at home and kick self for being lazy. 

Smiley, friendly staff. Lovely decor. Packed on holiday weekend, very difficult to pay at register with podium corralling people waiting from dining area. Cashier had to walk from register to me to retrieve payment.  Annoying space. 

Monkey been here, done that. It'll build a turd."}
{"text":"My ultimate favorite breakfast location! Food and service is always a 5 star. Wait time can be a little longer than i would like but that's because they are always so busy. The staff is always very kind and friendly i come here at least 3 times a month never gets old!!"}
{"text":"This is a super surprise. I thought one thing and totally different. The pancakes are to die for. Hash browns eggs done perfectly. Friendly nice staff. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I love Babystacks and I always recommended my friends and family to go eat at Babystacks when they come and visit.  However this was my first experience at this Babystacks Cafe and by far it didn't hold up to the other Babystacks location standards.  We were greeted by the host and our server Danny was nice. Today we got the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, side order of garlic rice, and a loco moco.  I was disappointed when I found hair in my garlic rice and immediately took it back.  It was a bummer.  The loco moco was okay except for the patty.  The patty was hard as a rock but the flavors were there. I'm very disappointed with today's experience hopefully when we come back next time it will be better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was great their potatoes are so good my family loves them and their portions are just right. The place is nice and clean. We ordered cookies and cream pancakes after the waiter recommended it and they were out-of-this world good. Service was amazing from the hostess to our waiter Gloria she was so sweet. Definitely know why this place got such high ratings on Yelp"}
{"text":"I normally go to the location in Centennial Hills and the food and service are great.  I was disappointed in this location.  The restaurant wasn't as clean as the CH location.  It wasn't busy and our server seemed to forget to bring almost everything we asked for.  The food was served lukewarm. Because I really like their food, I will give them another chance to impress me.  I'm hoping these comments will help them fix the issues."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Las Vegas!  The bananas foster pancakes are to die for!  A comfy, casual restaurant the entire family can enjoy."}
{"text":"So happy they opened a location closer to my house. I love their adobo fried rice. Just tried their banana foster pancake and have to say it's something I would like again. But nothing compared to Rise and Shine. The red velvet pancake I like better from stacks and yolks. Great place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and it is always busy. What I really like about this place is the huge menu. They have literally every type of pancake you can imagine from tiramisu pancakes to red velvet pancakes. I've also ordered the adobo omelet which is something I've never seen in any other restaurant. Every time I visit Vegas, I must come here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch spot in the Las Vegas suburbs.

I was craving pancakes and was happy to find this gem that serves breakfast until 2pm. There were many breakfast choices but I settled on the bacon stuffed pancakes.....Yum!

The waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating.

I'll be back to try more of the pancake choices."}
{"text":"Merry Grand Opening BabyStacks Cafe!

Where: 
In the Southwest on Blue Diamond between Buffalo and Cimarron. The restaurant is more spacious than the Flamingo/Buffalo location. 

Food: 
We had our \"usual\" order of the Spam Scramble with garlic fried rice, corned beef and eggs with hash browns, rocky road and banana cream pancakes.

We've had this same exact order at two other locations and there was no hiccup in quality despite it being their Grand Opening. In fact everything was up to the high quality standards I've come to expect from BabyStacks. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. 

Service: 
Was great and everything ran smoothly. Drinks never empty. I appreciate that we didn't have to wait long. 5-10 min till we were seated, which is great compared to some other wait times experienced at other locations."}
{"text":"yummburger!!!  stopped here for breakfast and glad I did, great food and great service. My girl went with the pancake upgrade, definitely go with some red velvet cakes, thumbs up on those. They had a few different options that sounded sooo good. Definitely check them out"}
{"text":"Giving four stars - instead of 5 - because the restaurant has made their portions smaller for sure.  Service was awesome!  We love their red velvet pancakes.  Coffee could be better.  Breakfast for two was around $35.00 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"My favorite Go to place after Church. However its always packed, but its worth the wait. Great red velvet pancakes, and enjoy the vibe of the place. Glad I took a chance with this place. When I leave Las Vegas I'm going to really miss Babystacks."}
{"text":"If you like creative pancakes and standard breakfast food this place will not disappoint. 

I can't think of anything bad about this place unless you're severely claustrophobic...even if you are eat some pancakes (Cinnabun) and you'll get past it."}
{"text":"Pancakes are amazing! But the omelets are sooooo food! Wish they were open later then 2:00 pm"}
{"text":"I don't often crave pancakes but when I do... I come to Baby Stacks Café. There is something for everyone here, the pancake variations are endless (almost). My favorite are the rocky road and my sweetie always gets the s'mores. The restaurant is usually packed so we get our food to go. Aside from the afore mentioned, the Kahlua benedicts are pretty good. Also their whipped cream is home made, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is usually our go-to for pancakes. They probably have the biggest variety in town. 
This was my first time at this location and like the others, it's quite busy. I NEVER eat at the restaurant because of how busy it is. Instead, we pick up and eat in the comfort of our own home :) 
The Mr. loves the S'mores pancakes and I typically try different ones. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their pancakes. All that I've tried have been delicious, it's a matter of what you like and in the mood for. I think Babystacks has a pancake for everyone. 
This time I had the Hazelnut and they were, of course, delicious. The best part is their home made whipped cream. It's delightfully creamy, sweet, and fluffy. I typically don't eat pancakes with whipped cream, but this one I can't say no to.
I also tried a new breakfast item, since trying chicken fried steak recently for the first time (if you read my reviews, you already know), I've decided to broaden my breakfast horizons. I tried Corned Beef Hash and it tasted good, flavorful and crispy. Not really my thing though. I usually get Kalua Pig Benny here, it's really good! Hash browns were not my fave either, a little under-cooked for me. But the seasoned fries are awesome so I will stick to those.
All in all, a great breakfast option, especially if you're a fan of pancakes."}
{"text":"Their pancakes really are delicious, especially the red velvet with cream cheese frosting. Soft, warm, fluffy pancakes with frosting that's not too sweet with a nice slight tart to it. I always get the corned beef hash, brother gets the spinach benedict and we split an order of red velvet pancakes to get the best of both worlds. Entrees come with a side of regular pancakes that you can substitute with a specialty pancake for an extra charge. That's typically the way to go if you want to try a little bit of everything on the menu without placing a full order of a stack of pancakes (too much for one person)."}
{"text":"Food was OK, it's the customer service that was a 0.  Went with 3 friends, asked the Mexican person for a table. Said we had to wait, we are all white people. A Mexican family came after us and was immediately sat. We waited another 10 min before being sat as anothwr group that came after us was seated, Phillipino, needless to say we won't be back at this prejudice establishment on blue diamond."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!  Love to take my whole family!"}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me, knows that I love stunt food. Crazy combinations, over the top ingredients, alternative meats, all of it. If it's unusual, hard to find, or exotic, I'm all in. And this is my kind of place!

They definitely serve hotcakes! Their pancakes are literally little mini hot cakes, and there are tons of choices. We had a hard time deciding, because there must be over 25 choices of pancakes! We went with carrot cake and German chocolate pancakes, upgraded onto our entrees. They were amazing, like you deconstructed a cake right out of the oven. (I'm definitely a dessert person, and proud of it!)

 The entrees were good as well. I had the Portuguese sausage & eggs, with chunk potatoes. Next time I would order the hashbrowns, to help soak up my eggs. The potatoes were ok, but not super exciting. Everything else was great. My friend ordered the cheddar, bacon, & avocado omelette, with hashbrowns, and ate every single bite of it. 

The place is very small, so I imagine it's a nightmare on weekends for wait times. We were there on Tuesday at 11am, so not bad at all. The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses in the small shopping center, so parking might be difficult at peak times also.

The prices were reasonable,  especially for such exotic choices. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I'm going to have to work my way through the menu. Chipping off a little bit at a time. Bucket list, try it all."}
{"text":"small restaurant with a long line, great service here, warm and friendly staff, and good food. definitely worth a try. my Portuguese sausage was just not crispy enough, and the portions were average. They would do well to serve their plates w just a bit more white rice. Everything tasted delicious, and again, great customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"If you have not been here yet RUN do not walk!!!  Go now!  (Unless it's past lunchtime and they are closed.)   We attempted to eat here on a weekend morning, but there was a line going out the door so we didn't even get out of our car.  Yesterday, a Wedsneday, my daughter and I decided to drop in.  The place was very plain.  I guess I was expecting it to be fancier, but it's not fancy at all.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  The menu had tons of items on it.  Everything sounded so good, it was hard to decide what to order!   So, we each picked something to share.  We ordered the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich with macaroni salad, and a skillet with scrambled eggs, potatoes, green sauce, and whatever else they put in there.  OMG...... everything was so amazing!!!!   We could totally understand why it's packed on the weekends!   The prices were reasonable, and the portions were fair.  My only complaint is that they are not open for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Meh... it was just ok. It feels more like a cafeteria then restaurant and most of the pancakes are just too sweet. They are more like desserts then pancakes. The 2 times we went, the wait staff was polite and took our orders pretty quickly. To me however, the price was a bit high.

However, this place should be tried, especially if you have a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing but i literally have to walk to the door and see if the one kid is working because hes that bizarre. I wont go there while hes working because i literally feel awkward. I just had to leave cause i saw him inside and all i want in the world is strawberry crepes. I feel like rude leaving this review but its honestly ridiculous."}
{"text":"I would have given them more stars if there greeters would have greeted me.  I had to interrupt them chatting with each other to ask to put my name on the list.  Banana cream pancakes were amazing and so were the red velvet and Rick's Adobo fried rice!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This the rating I give this place. I have been here 4 times 3 times we were not able to go in because the wait was over a hour. This last time I showed up with my father and my 10 month old son. We asked for a table for 3 plus baby. They would not sit us or even acknowledge that we were there. My sister and I live across the street in Desert Shores but my sister could not find her keys. They said we can not sit you until everyone is present. My son was starting to get fussy because we are not sitting him down. They sat 8 other tables by the time we waited. So I asked if we could please be sited the girl at the front said it was a 30 minute wait. I have been wanting to eat there 4 times needles to say they are not friendly. They did not care that 3 out of the 4 were there and by the time we were walking out not even a bye. I say I rather go to the cracked egg because I can at least be treated as with respect and to be acknowledged, and to top it of I can have breakfast with my family. 


Shame on you Baby Stacks that's 2 less households you will not have as costumers. And believe me I will tell everyone I know if the horrible experience at your establishment."}
{"text":"Quick tip when you are crowded / busy dont have an 18 year old kid trying to seat everyone.... doesn't work.... we were a party of 4 with a party of  6 ahead of us .... open table of 4 right in front of us sat empty for 20 minutes....we were refused seating because the kid was trying to  come up with a plan to shove 6 into the table for 4.... wow...in the meantime 5 parties of 2 waltz right in and get seating...in the end we were given a booth that would have sat 6... while the table of 4 still sat empty...and the party of 6 still sat waiting.... we could have taken the table for 4 and the 6 could've sat where we sat....confused?  Read first sentence... oh yeah... food....?  Food was good as always but we waited 20 minutes while a table sat empty right in front of us ... we were on a tight clock (had to be somewhere) and had to rush ... 
."}
{"text":"This was our third or fourth time coming to the babystacks chain and our second time at this venue... What can I say? Just that this has become a regular stop on our travels to Las Vegas... Especially for my kids... We were all the way over in Mandalay Bay and my kids wanted nothing but babystacks for breakfast...

Our orders consisted of s'mores pancakes, Cinnabon pancakes, Rocky Road pancakes, and cookies and cream pancakes... Throw in some seasoned potatoes and one slide order of eggs and all four of us were taken care of... Not to mention, my mother-in-law accompanied us and she is a strict vegetarian... The chef made a very nice skillet for her consisting  of potatoes and cheeses and a multitude of vegetables in a spicy sauce that kept her very happy as well... Thank you for accommodating that!  Our orders were delicious, tasty... Sinfully good!

My one big question is how come you don't find this chain in one of the big Resort Hotels? I think it would be a grand slam... The masses who wander the strip on foot have no clue what a great little place this is!

Better yet, keep it our little secret ;-)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and our server was friendly and attentive. Kalua grilled cheese and chicken fried steak were great. We had bananas foster and red velvet babycakes. All I can say is wow!"}
{"text":"Overall the experience was good. They had some fantastic pancakes. The staff was friendly and attentive. Our meal was great. I'm giving them a 4 star because it was above average but nothing out of this world. Also because the restaurant was small. If I came here with 6 people it'd be nearly impossible to be seated in any reasonable time frame. Maybe if we show our support for a good place they can expand. Here's to hoping because the owners run a tight ship and have a staff who are genuinely happy to work there"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and normally service here is pretty good but I changed my pancakes this one time. I had to send them back twice. Gloria was our server/manager on staff (I don't get how she is a manager to even start off). She was pretty rude and she was talking to me with a bunch of disrespect in her voice and tone. She then brings me the check and nothing was discounted (I'm not one to want a discount) but a simple 10% off or anything was kinda expected. When I asked to speak to a manager she came over and continued to argue with how we ordered the pancakes wrong... I just don't get it I'll just go to a different breakfast place I'm just left with such a bad taste in my mouth... I'm extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot for the most part I would just stray away from their crepes they are really spongey.... Also I had their hazelnut pancakes which have Nutella on them and it had barely any Nutella on it at all same as the crepe my buddy from Australia had the Nutella and strawberry crepe and there were like 4 strawberries and next to no Nutella I felt like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Calling all visitors who are visiting from the islands to come to this new location of Babystacks Cafe.  This was my first time to this place and not disappointed at all.  I've wanted to try it on my last visit but I didn't get a chance too but on this visit it was a \"must\".  I was so glad this location had just opened no more than 2 weeks ago! 
Location-
Easy to find right now only one front sign but adding the second side sign.
Inside decoration-
Very simple gardening decorations on the walls to me it gives you a very peaceful atmosphere!  Nice clean tables/chairs and 6 counter stools.  Like most local filipino
houses guess what they got hanging on the wall? The wooden fork and spoon! Hawaiian/island reggae music playing in the restaurant. 
Food-
I wanted to try a little bit of everything!  But I settled for these...
Red velvet pancakes
Kalua pork grilled cheese with fries
Portuguese sausage and rice (the rice tasted like jasmine rice) not a real fan.
I thought the pancakes was awesome! My favorite! Then the Portuguese sausage just topped it off! I didn't know what to expect on the grilled cheese but I must saw it won my gut!
Overall-
I will definitely bring more of family and friends here to try it out...Local people will always support locals no matter what."}
{"text":"Let me just say whatever location I go to I have a blast and this location is one of my favorites with great servers like Jacob it's no wonder this is one of my favorite places. They are very attentive and help give you good food choices my omelette was the best idea yet and you guys were pretty clutch for that. Definitely will be back with more friends"}
{"text":"I came in at 12:12 on 3-10-16. I was greeted immediately and was sat as soon as the hostess was done giving change to another customer. My server Danielle was AWESOME! She was super nice and always made sure I didn't need anything multiple times. I had the country fried steak and eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly (I asked for over easy) and the country fired steak was amazing ! I love their gravy! I also upgraded to the pb and jay pancakes , BOMB! 
Overall food was amazing and so was the service!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Waiting is definitely a pain but the food is just so good. Red Velvet pancakes were delicious and Adobo Fried Rice was like a taste of home."}
{"text":"I will admit they have delicious food. My pancakes tasted fantastic, the bacon was cooked perfectly. Got my food pretty quickly. 
I went with a group of friends and at the end of our meal we asked for our checks and he came back with one check. We didn't know that we couldn't split the check in until we got to the register.
But bad customer service doesn't make me want to go back."}
{"text":"The wait was definitely worth it. My great friend treated me to a birthday brunch today. As a first time customer, I'm very pleased with both the service and especially the food. Their garlic fried rice with onions is excellent bit their red velvet pancakes are to die for. I  consumed my food so fast no time for pictures. More of a reason to return :)"}
{"text":"We were greeted right away which is always a plus. 4 stars because of the busy crowd & wait time but the food is totally worth it. 
the wait time was spot on & we received the drinks & food quick. the servers here are excellent & customer service overall is A1."}
{"text":"Cute place always busy. very big menu everything comes out fast!   Wish they would have more vegan choices tho"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back and Vegas and enjoy this marvelous yummy restaurant. The best pancakes ever. Great service! I have been on vacation since June 3 and this is the best restaurant we have visited."}
{"text":"Food: I should have stuck with the pancakes. I am visiting from Hawaii and was a little home sick so I wanted to try the loco moco. First off I was a little disappointed that they couldn't sub fried rice for a small up charge but rather only could do garlic rice (over garlicked) or buy the $10 adobo fried rice on the side. This is something any L&L, big city diner, loco moco shop does easily. The gravy too tasted a little... Boxed. The coffee tasted distinctly plasticky mixed with that airplane coffee taste of bad water, and the sugar didn't make it any better. But I will admit this is my fault for ordering something Hawaiian in Las Vegas. My husband got the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes and gobbled them up so those were good. 

-stick to pancakes 

Ambiance: the staff was very nice and smiley, a little inattentive but functional. The decor is a little sparse but the music was nice! 

Overall: good place to get breakfast if you want traditional breakfast foods, but they have some work to do on their Hawaiian local specialities."}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended this place and it was worth the visit. I got the corned beef hash with a substitute to German chocolate pancakes. Easy parking, relaxed set up and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am generally not a fan of breakfast food. About once a year I get a craving. We chose Babystacks to satisfy our urge. It was as good as the other reviews. The place is hidden on the back side of a shopping center. Was not busy so we were seated immediately. Food was served about 10 minutes after ordering. Red velvet pancakes were moist and delicious. Sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. We also shared Rick's Adobo Rice & Egg. It was also delicious. Came with macaroni salad. All generous portions. We will return."}
{"text":"I was sooo hungry and I thought this place could accommodate my food allergy. But NOPE. I left hungry and disappointed. Nothing gluten-free. I usually don't write negative reviews however for this I will make an exception. Nothing here is gluten-free. Sooo hungry! Maybe even a tad hangry."}
{"text":"What is the hype about this place?  Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 6 regular tables and 6 bar tables that use high chairs.  I was going to order the chicken fried steak, but the server said it's frozen and then fried.  I asked about the corned beef hash being made scratch, but it's out of a can.  I asked if they make their biscuits from scratch and the server said \"I think so.\".  I was alarmed.  I went with the Kaluha pork eggs benedict with the seasoned potatoes.  Very disappointing. The potatoes are just deep fried potato cubes.  No bellpepper and onions.  The pork was smokey and just okay.  My sister had the loco moco. The gravy was bland.  The hamburger patties had a good flavor.  We also had a short stack of buttermilk cakes.  They were okay.  Nothing I would write home about.  140+ Yelpers averagin 4.5 stars really had me puzzled.  The food isn't made from scratch.  Frozen and canned just don't get me in that 4.5 star mood.  Spam is the only canned item I would accept only because you know it's canned.  Corned Beef Hash doesn't mean it's canned unless they say Hormel Corned Beef Hash."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place for pancakes! I'm not even a pancake person, but I love babystacks!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We ordered the garlic rice, portuguese sausage, and fried eggs plate. Also the red velvet pancakes with all the sides, scrambled eggs, and bacon. Would highly recommend trying this place. Gave 4 stars because the wait time is just so long."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. We've tried almost everything on their menu and I would definitely recommend this spot to everyone. Everytime we have visitors from out of town, this is one place we would bring them too. I'm raving all about them so why the 4 stars? Well, the wait is ridiculous! Extremely ridiculous! They know they've gotten popular and they are aware of that yet they stay at this little place. My wait time right now is 1 hour. The food must be that good that people would wait that long. Maybe. But that could even be the cause of their downfall. Change the location. Make the place bigger. Whatever needs to be done to decrease the time wait."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came in for a bite to eat, and was very pleased with everything.

Our server Liliana was very nice. We had a great experience, she and the other servers were constantly at us with refills and always made sure we had everything we needed. Amazing service, I wish every restaurant had service like Babystacks!

We had a beef hash with rice, and the breakfast burrito, with a share of pancakes. The beef hash was solid, however the breakfast burrito could have been better, not much meat and the red sauce that it came with was too sweet to pair with it. The hazelnut pancakes were AWESOME. 

Long story short, good food, great service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I found this cafe before leaving for our trip on Yelp. I showed my son and he said he was in. So we decided to leave the strip to try this cafe out and boy did it not disappoint! We wanted pancakes but then saw there menu offered so much more like Hawaiian favorites Loco Moco. I just had to get it. The server asked if I wanted potatoes, toast or pancakes and I was amazed to hear I could choose pancakes! So I got the best of both words. Same for my son who ordered the Kalua pork grilled cheese and a side of orange creamsicle pancakes. I got the side of bananas foster pancakes. 

Our server brought our entrees our first and than our pancakes. Tastes my loco moco and it was just comfort food from the start. Rice was perfect, with the right amount of gravy to mix with the egg and a nice size hamburger patty. My son bit into his grilled cheese and all I get is a smile and a giggle and yum. For him to try a grilled cheese with pork was huge and this didn't disappoint. Onto our pancakes I tried the banana foster and they were so flavorful I took a bite and I was like \"yum!\" He tried his creamsicle pancakes and he was like \"wow\" and I was like \"oh my\" and we were like \"should we ditch the Vegas buffet tomorrow and it was a \"yes!\" The orange creamsicle had cream cheese syrup not glaze syrup! You place them in your mouth and it is a flavor bomb. 

So the next day I got Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice which is fried rice with marinated chicken wrapped in a egg omelet so good. The fried rice and the chicken was so good I could just order a big bowl of that on its own. Than I had the tiramisu pancakes and those were soft and creamy. These pancakes are not your typical pancake batter. Each pancake on the menu has its own batter and specialty toppings to make that flavor combination so they really know their pancakes. We definitely will be back the next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! Great food and service.!! The red velvet pancakes are a must ! The only down side is the wait time but I honestly don't mind because the food is worth it !"}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay! Service was good, a wide selection of pancakes they were way overly sweet though! My loco moco was not good. Rice was hard, burger patty was extremely salty, and the gravy was really bad. Coffee was also meh. I'd much rather go to Kitchen Table or Hash House, probably won't be back, but I didn't regret trying it!"}
{"text":"Had the country fried steaks and eggs. It was awesome! Red velvet pancakes were delicious with the cream cheese syrup!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot for the area. The worst part about coming here will be trying to decide on just one menu item. Before I even ordered I knew that I'd be back again.

We arrived on Saturday morning to a packed restaurant which I expected. We were quoted a 10-15 minute wait, but didn't wait nearly that long. As soon as we were seated our waiter came by to take drink orders. Once he returned with drinks a few minutes later he offered to take our orders, but didn't rush us. Our waiter continued to return frequently refilling drinks and checking in on us. He was friendly and everyone working the morning I visited seemed jolly. 

I had the French Toast Combo with Honey Toast, Bacon, and over medium eggs. Yum! The French Toast was perfectly prepared and has a nice crisp to it. The eggs were prepared more on the over easy side, but that wasn't a big deal.  The portion was perfect for me. It filled me up without feeling like I had eaten too much.

My husband had the Banana Cream Pie pancakes, a full stack. The portion was huge and he really enjoyed it. I liked the flavor of it as well. There were plenty of bananas and cream pie on top.

We'll definitely be back. I can't wait to try their Filipino breakfast option!"}
{"text":"Yum. This was our fist time here. The food was very good but the restaurant was small. We got there at noon on a Saturday, I bet it's packed earlier in the day."}
{"text":"My favorite here is the adobo fried rice omelette with a side of babystacks German chocolate pancake!  I love that you can get any pancakes on the menu for your side.  They can get really busy even the weekdays but you will get seated within 5-10 mins.  The servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"My problem with breakfast food is, my eyes always get bigger than my stomach, so I always end up over-eating, feeling way too stuffed, and then napping for a couple hours. But anyways...

I ended up building my own omelette and getting a short stack of carrot cake pancakes with cream cheese \"syrup\". Both dishes were great, but the omelette wins by a few points. But to be fair, pancakes are never my choice of breakfast food, unless it's Swedish pancakes.. but that's a different story. I'm definitely an eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes person."}
{"text":"Sorry but I'm not ready for this bandwagon yet. I love neighborhood joints, I really do! I give automatic 4 stars for mom and pop places that are innovative, offer something special and follow up with fantastic service. Babycakes have real potential to hit all those marks if they correct a couple of things:

1. Service is fast and efficient but doesn't really have any personality that stands out.
2. My poached eggs came out well and I didn't even get the opportunity to send it back because no one came to check on us. 
3. Your red velvet pancake is the bomb, but it's not showcased. It's like having Kobe Bryant on your team, but keeping him on the bench. Why bother? 
4. The wait is atrocious for people who would want to trek here for breakfast. If you live far away and come here to wait for another 45 min - 1hr, you may leave feeling disappointed. 

I guess my expectation for this place was too high. And considering I value my Sunday so much, I hated the fact that I spent 2.5 hrs on something that didn't live up to what I had imagined."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place, it was probably close to two years ago.  Back then I was expecting some amazing mouth watering experience since all I kept hearing about was Baby Stacks (baby cakes back in the day) and read a spread about it in the Seven Magazine. 

We had a party of 6 which i understand there was wait since the location is extremely small with only about 10 tables.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (corn tortillas layered with refried beans, seasoned diced chicken, cheese, two eggs, and covered with their homemade fresh salsa) thinking that it should be good though yes, i understand that the is place when raved about was on their pancakes.... When the food came out it was okay... I cant really say it was good because it really lacked a lot of flavor.  I had to pour a ton of hot sauce and salt on it to make it taste like anything!

My boyfriend ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict (Toasted English Muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke flavored pork, topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce).  His choice was so much better! The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, the pork was flavorful, the english muffin had the right amount of crunch that gave the dish an added texture! I ended up eating half of his dish cause it was so much better then mine!

Red Velvet Pancakes (topped with their fresh whipped cream and chocolate crumbles ans served with cream cheese syrup).  So this is supposedly what they are known for.  I THINK NOT! Yes, it tasted like red velvet cupcake but it also tasted like I was going end up diabetic.  The cream cheese syrup was the topper for me on spitting the piece out of my mouth.  I just couldnt swallow it because it tasted like it was only made out of powdered sugar... 

Today was my second time coming here.  We waited for 30 minutes which is okay since our party of 3 expected it on a Sunday.  During that time, I figured i'd look over the menu and make sure I'm careful this time and pick something that ends up being at least good.  

WRONG!  I decided to go for simple this time and ordered the Spam and Eggs with the Garlic Rice upgrade.  Spam was heated on the flat top and gave it a hard exterior which made it almost chewy and not what I want in spam.  The garlic rice had no flavor at all and I actually thought it was just plain rice and didnt give me the right order until I noticed a big chuck of onion at the bottom of my plate and I thought \"Oh i guess they did get the order right, but this doesnt taste like anything!\"  

The buttermilk pancakes that came with the dish wasnt bad (which i'm glad cause I really hope nobody would be able to mess up regular pancakes especially a place known for their pancakes).  However the pancakes were cold... which is pretty strange since the plate it was on was a little bit warm.  Normally I would understand this if I left it on the table for a while but once the waiter put it down, I checked cause it looked cold.  

I think the only thing they got truely right on my order was my over easy eggs... 

My boyfriend ended up getting the Biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy wasnt too bad with the help of salt! The order comes with 3 small biscuits that are hard.  I take that back, only 2 were hard and the last one couldnt even be cut when you stabbed it with a fork.  Yes, he did try to do this and the fork amazing stayed completely vertical in the air.   When we asked if the biscuit were usually like this, the waiter said no but in that hesitated tone that made you think somebody knew but hoped the customers didnt noticed... 

I will never come back to this place.  One time, shame on me, second time, shame on them!"}
{"text":"The best desert breakfast place in town! Their biscuits and gravy is also a go to of mine. Wait time is usually less than what they quote it as. I see why their line is always out the door."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about Babystacks, I was really looking forward to going. When we arrived it was packed! They told us it would be a 25 minute wait, but it only ended up being about 10 minutes. I had the Huntington omelette with the spud chips & banana cream pie pancakes. Lots of food! Everything was hot & very good. I think I am giving it four stars because I had heard so much hype, maybe my expectations were too high. The service was good. My family (4 people) all ordered the same with variations on the omelette & pancake flavors. The bill with tip was $71.00. I tasted my daughter's red velvet pancakes & that were delicious. My husband had the blueberry which were more on the traditional side. Overall a good experience & we'll go back. Just wish it hadn't been talked up so much! It's just good breakfast food, nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"Almost every weekend we get nutella crepes & their BLT to go. Not only is the food delicious, but they are always kind & courteous. They even take the time (even though they are always swamped) to open each box to ensure the order is correct. Everyone who knows me, knows I rave about Babystacks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My Loco Moco plate was phenomenal!  The red velvet pancakes were delicious. My husband was jealous of us because he ordered lunch. 

My only complaint was the 'gravy boogers'.  You know, it sits too long and gets a skin on top.  Apparently, I got all that. That grossed me out. I pulled off those long bogeys and proceeded to tear it up. We got seated quicker than expected for 7.  Overall delightful. My friend didn't care too much for the hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"1 star for management, 5 stars for our server. We get there yesterday morning and are told it would be a 20-30 minute wait, which is normal for this restaurant. Because of the size of our party, we choose to wait outside. 35 minutes have passed and we are still waiting outside and we're starting to wonder what is going on. Shortly after, a woman in a white dress comes to ask if we have a party of 10. I said yes and she said that they've been calling for you. Not thinking about it, I followed her in. She went off to the side to talk to another girl, and I said \"Wait, you don't even work here?\" She said no, I just saw you and your family waiting for a long time from inside. I thanked her and said it was appreciated. I went up to an elderly haole woman behind the counter and gave her our name.  She was surprised that we were still there. Apparently they had just given up our table. I said, did you even go outside? She said yes we did. And I thought, wtf? Another non-working customer just came outside to grab us. If it wasn't for that other customer, we would probably still be standing outside one day later as I type this. So stupid. Don't lie to my face that you came outside when you didn't. Despite that Haole's ignorance, our server made us forget her and made or meal great. Get someone else to run the front."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I got the veggie omelette and upgraded my pancakes to the carrot cake ones. HOLY CRAP. Seriously so crazy good. I inhaled the food so fast. No coffee on the menu, but besides that definitely amazing. Recommend to anyone out of town looking for a tasty morning bite."}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick breakfast. We were seated promptly. Service is good. They have a large selection of pancakes ranging from red velvet to oreo. The portions are large so unless you're very hungry, sharing is a good idea. They are a fan of spam so if you like that,  many choices. It's not a traditional breakfast menu. Has intl flair such as kalbi with eggs,  kahlua benedict, etc. We had the breakfast burrito and it wasn't large compared to the omelettes. Coffee was ok."}
{"text":"The redvelvet pancakes were not on the hook.  Super light and delicious topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings and believe it or not, it was not too rich.  There was also a frosting dipping sauce that tasted like cinnamon roll glaze.  Very well executed.  I wanted another order.  The other pancake options looked tasty as well.  There were several others that I wanted to try.  Everything they brought out for other tables looked great.  Seeing someone else get the home fry potatoes persuaded me to get them instead of hash browns and I almost always get hash browns if they are available.  

We also got the spinach benedict.  That looked the best to me and that with the potatoes was great.

We were curious about the Kalua Grilled Cheese (NO, it isn't alcoholic, weirdo!) and when asked if it was good, the waitress (who was really sweet) confirmed that it was really good and she had just recently tried it.  Done deal.

Everything we had was good.  I don't regret any of the choices.

Definitely give this place a try for a casual breakfast."}
{"text":"First of all, the ambiance is nothing special. In a sort of run down strip mall and all the signs (on Xerox paper with highlighter) plastered all over their doors and hostess table are very off putting. The signs pretty much say one of two things: they will not seat parties until the entire party arrives and they will not split checks. I don't really have a problem with the first (lots of places only seat entire parties) it is more the way they convey the message. Just kind of rude/bossy. But the no splitting checks thing just baffles me. I can't remember the last time (ever?!) I've been to a place that won't do it. 

The menu is huge. So many different types of pancakes! Every flavor under the sun. They have savory items too, but really the pancake choices seem like what 9/10 people order. Normally I am not a huge sweet breakfast fan. I much prefer savory, but, when in Rome... 

So I got the short stack of Red Velvet pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. Definitely could qualify as dessert more than breakfast! The pancakes were very good! Fluffy and had a great red velvet flavor. Surprisingly, I enjoyed them more than I expected. I couldn't even finish the short stack though because they were pretty rich. 

Service was fine. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. 

I think just maybe classing up the way they convey their (kind of annoying) policies could bump them up to 4 stars for me. A little more polish could go a long way."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I went with my friends for brunch yesterday and everything we ordered was delicious. The red velvet pancakes were really yummy."}
{"text":"I'm the biggest supporter of Babystacks, have been eating it for years, recommend it to anyone who will listen...  the food really is that good.  Today though my Babystacks love affair might have ran its course.  Was seated as soon as I walked in, no wait which is great, usually there's at least some wait.  Server brings me some coffee, I order, start waiting for my delicious breakfast to arrive...  reading some news articles on my phone I notice a few parties arrive, they've got to wait around 5 minutes to be seated, so I've been seated and food ordered easily 5-10 minutes before they arrived...  coffee cups empty, no big deal food will be out shortly so I wait, it is getting a little busy so I leave the staff alone, not too bothered at this point...  5 more minutes go by, party that was seated after me gets a full spread of food and refills delivered to them.  I start to look for my waitress, maybe my order got jumbled up it happens...  few minutes go by nothing.  Coffee cup still empty...  approach the counter and ask if maybe there's a mix up, people that were seated long after me are well into their meals and I've had an empty cup of coffee in front of me for 10 minutes...  lady is real blunt, \"sir your food it coming we are busy\".  I say \"Yeah I get that but those people sat down 10 minutes after I ordered and they're halfway through their meal, maybe there's a mix up with my order...  she gives me a stop bothering me look, says she'll check on it so I go sit back down...  see her call the waitress over, they have a conversation, while they're talking another waitress brings my food...  coffee cup still empty, no offer to refill...  at this point I'm playing a game to see how long it takes someone to refill my cup.  Food is room temp at best, bacon is cold to the touch...  my waitress comes over to ask if everything's ok, I say not really...  well is there anything I can get you?  Umm yeah coffee would be good since I've been sitting here with an empty cup in front of me for the last 20 minutes...  eat my lackluster $20 breakfast and go to pay...  lady says that'll be $20, I had already set my card down with the check, she stands there with her hand out I point to where I had placed it on the register, she scans my card and just tosses it on the counter.  I'm no body language expert by any means, but you could tell she was being passive aggressive by the way she just chucked it on the counter...  I'm standing there with my hand out to take my card back and she just throws it at me like she's dealing black jack on Fremont street.  By this time I'm past the point of pissed off...  \"Is there a problem?\" I ask.  She gets a look on her face like she's trying to hold back a fart.  I say \"Look, I've been here 100 times, never had this bad of service...  is there a manager I can talk to?\"  She gets this kind of fuck you, yeah I'll get you the manager kind of condescending tone...  brings the manager over and it's the same one who brought my food to me when the original waitress didn't...  I'm a pretty loyal eater, I have my spots I love and recommend, this Babystacks has always been one of those spots, but today they lost a customer...  pretty sure it won't hurt their bottom line, just feel really let down by my experience there today...  I'll be sure and let people know about Egg and I or the cracked egg from now on instead of Babystacks...  also wanna point out after reading other reviews I'm not the first who's had problems with the old bitty in the 1982 rimmed glasses that works the register.  Might be time to make a move, a hostess' job is customer interaction, she might be better suited washing dishes or something, customer service isn't her forte."}

{"text":"I don't even like pancakes but their red velvet pancakes are to die for!!! And the Mexican skillet"}
{"text":"Great place to eat off the strip.   It was my first time there and I love this place.  We went over easter time and the wait was 40 min. wait but it's worth the wait.  I had eggs and crispy bacon along cinnabum pancakes.  My whole meal was delicious!  Nice service and refill on drinks."}
{"text":"You want to know two things that are the same in Las Vegas and San Diego?  

1. The name Babycakes.
2. They both serve red velvet pancakes.

The only difference is that in Babycakes Cafe in Las Vegas it is much cheaper to get the full stack.  You get six pancakes topped with cream cheese syrup for nine dollars.  In San Diego, you get two pancakes with cream cheese spread on top and in between the pancakes with fruit for $11.  

Personally, I would rather have red velvet pancakes in Las Vegas than San Diego because I get my money worth for six pancakes for nine dollars.  Sorry, Babycakes in San Diego.  

I recommend coming to Babycakes Cafe on a weekday near opening time because my boyfriend and I didn't wait on a Tuesday morning around 10:15 AM.  

If you love red velvet everything-cupcakes, drinks, pancakes--I recommend getting these pancakes.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast! Came here this past sunday. Hostess was a little snobby for some reason. They had a 15 min wait  which wasnt bad for a sunday. Today i got the portugese sausage w egg and my boyfriend got the pig omellette. Food came out quickly and service was good!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I really don't like giving out 4 Stars to breakfast joints because no breakfast place can reinvent the pancake, its the same everywhere. But not this place! RED VELVET PANCAKES oh yaaaa 

Red Velvet Pancakes: 4/5 I'm not a big pancake person because I'm not much of a sweets person but my boyfriend is. He loved them! practically inhaled them. The velvet pancakes were very soft and fluffy and you could definitely taste the red velvet especially topping it with cream cheese icing. A little sweet for my taste but my boyfriend loved it. 

Bacon Spinach Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise sauce: 5/5 I've never had eggs Benedict but I was looking for something on their menu that consisted my favorite's for breakfast: eggs, cheese, spinach, bacon, sausage. Closes thing they had was the spinach eggs Benedict. I was iffy about the hollandaise sauce because its a buttery sauce but it complimented the Bacon Spinach Benedict perfectly. The hollandaise sauce kind of taste a bit cheesy to me. 

Pastrami Sandwich: 3/5 My boyfriend ordered this, he said it was a bit salty but that's pastrami for you. There wasn't anything special to the sandwich when I took a bite so I'm rating this average. 

Coffee: 0/5  I was actually disappointed about their coffee, I don't know maybe I was \"expecting\" too much? BUT When I hear \"cafe\" I think of coffee's & espresso's. Yet all they had was regular coffee and black. This place came off to me more like a DINER than a CAFE."}
{"text":"Yum, so ono! Chili moco and bananas foster short stack, I can't even breathe I'm so full!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Both times the service was great. Friendly and attentive. 
The first time, a few months ago, the place was packed. The food actually was better. 
This time we were practically the only ones there. The food wasn't as good. I had the Wheat French Toast. It tasted good but was a bit over cooked. My side of scrambled eggs came out cold. My partners egg scramble was also over cooked on the potatoes. Seemed like the kitchen just wasn't on point."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday, and it was the worst breakfast I had ever had at an establishment. They first sat us down at a table that wasn't clean,  we then ordered our food and it took them 45 minutes to bring out my friends meal, she ordered  the banana foster pancakes, (their were just two of us eating) and forgot about mine. I ordered the eggs Benedict with spinach and mushrooms and the eggs poached hard with a sided of Portuguese sausage. 10 minutes after my friend receiving her meal, they brought out mine. The eggs were running which I specifically told the waitress that they needed to be poached hard and she also forgot the sausage. When she initially came out with my food she placed it on the table and ran off, so I wasn't able to correct it immediately and she then disappeared for an additional 10 minutes. I had to flag down another associate to get them to come down to my table and then tell them about how my meal wasn't done right. They said they would get my waitress, so again I waited an additional 5-8 minutes till she came around and I explained how they messed up on my meal and she wanted to argue with me about what I ordered. She said, \" You know the eggs are running for the eggs Benedict.\" I told her \"I know that but I don't eat them that way, \"and she said \"she well that's the way the normal do it.\" I understand that, but as a customer, I'm not asking for much at all about them poaching my eggs longer so they are over hard. After that she grabbed my plate and I told her I was done and that I'm not going to wait another hour to eat my meal when they brought out my friends early so she already ate and it was done along with her forgetting the sausage. The long and the short of this is that the meal was mediocre, the service was horrible, and I don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Great concept, extensive menu choices, pancake batter could be lights and fluffier. Nutella with whipped cream was good but cakes could be better . biscuit and gravy was 7/10 ham instead of sausage was good change. Huntington skillet with carnitas was legit great flavor....maybe add biscuit under there."}
{"text":"This spot could use an Expansion Pack, if you know what i mean Lol. I was surprised we didnt have to wait in line to be seated.
Evangeline (our waitress) is a busy worker with a great personality. Keep it up!
Going right into it, I enjoyed the Mexican Omelette which had jalapenos thrown into it and served with seasoned potatoes on the side. 7 
White Chocolate Macadamia stacks w/ cream cheese sauce were outstanding. 10!
Steak and Eggs didnt seem to impress me at all. Hash browns had no flavor and eggs were bland as well. As for the steak, it was juicy but had to throw some A1 to get the flavor i wanted. 6
I did digg their Hawaiian jams that came on every so often though. I guess you can say, it set the mood. 

Make sure you hit up this joint! Its more than worth it to stop by with their prices.
If it wasnt for the orgasmic tasting pancakes,  i believe they would be a 3 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Time Matters!  We tried this place for the 1st time last recently.  The hostess needs help with her perception of time and service.  I showed up with my family and was told 30-35 minutes was the wait to be seated.  The place was packed and decided to take a chance on the wait.  It was in a shopping center and we weren't going to wait outside with 3 kids.  I took the kids to go sit in the car while my wife went an picked up an item at a nearby story in the center.  After 15 minutes, I asked my daughter to go check and see how the wait was going.  She came running back saying that they had called us several times and we needed to go or we would lose our spot.  I grabbed the kids an ran into the restaurant; however, the hostess asked if we were all together and I told her No, but my wife will be here in a moment.  The hostess said, \"I can't seat you unless you are all together.\"  I replied with, \"You are going to seat us and if I need order for my wife, I can since I know what she likes.\"  The hostess told me, No again. I told her that we would not be in this predicament if she would have been more accurate on her time.  So, she sat us down.  Some may be excited that to see that they wait wasn't as long as suggested, but when you're juggling 5 people.  That task is not as easy as one might seem.  Luckily the food was okay.  But due to the service at the beginning, I have no intention of returning.  I wish I recalled her name, but it was an older woman with a grumpy attitude and who likes to yell.  A hostess is a critical component of a dining experience.  They are the first person the customer sees and the last one too.  Centennial doesn't have many good breakfast options, but I don't mind traveling 10 miles to get the experience I expect."}
{"text":"My wife and I, plus another couple, piled into the car on a Friday morning, and headed over around 9am.  We were sold on the trek from the Strip based on their menu online.

We found this cute lil place that clearly had good food.  We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but we were seated in under 5 minutes.

The waitress got the drinks quick and was ready with all our questions on the menu.  We had three different omelets that were picture perfect!  We tried their German Chocolate, Strawberry, and Cinnabon pancakes.  All were great lil piles of smiles!!

A really great bang for your buck breakfast spot!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best kept secrets in Mountain's Edge. Not only it serves great food, including the cinnamon pancakes and skillets, but also the service is exceptional. Jason provided excellent, above and beyond, service. Get there before 8AM to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"This is such a yummy place!  Very authentic Hawaiian.  Whatever you get get it with the garlic rice. So amazing.  Everything is great here so I suggest it all especially the spam:). It's a cute little cafe with a moderate amount of seating.  Can be a long wait on weekends so get there early. If there's a line it's worth the wait;)"}
{"text":"I love this pancake shop. The pancakes are huge, and the choices are nice. The only problem would be that it's a little bit too sweet."}
{"text":"If you love breakfast and pancakes, then this is the place for you.

So many choices, all of the ones I've tried have been amazing.  The staff is helpful and friendly and if there's a long wait (there has always been a wait when I go) you can get a cup of coffee to pass the time.  

Red velvet pancakes are incredible.  They had a special bananas foster for a while too that are my current favorite.  

I think they are expanding too, there are other locations!  Seriously awesome pancakes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant and our server Joey was awesome. The only thing that made me want to give this place a 1 star review is the fact that this is the second time I have found HAIR in my food. I would think that they would not charge me for the food that had the hair in it as a courtesy, but both times I had this encounter they still charged me. They need to practice proper sanitation in the kitchen, because this is NOT how customers should feel leaving an establishment of this nature. I am secretly disgusted and would not be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"Okay.  Not so great as everyone states.   I though the Huevos rancheros were so so.  The chicken was cubed and took away.   The tortillas were not fried before hand.   I think egg and I is better.   HOWEVER, if you like Hawaiian breakfast, then I would recommend you go."}
{"text":"I think the food was great.   I did not like the wait and noticed that empty tables were left empty for a considerable time.   The Huevos Rancheros were okay.   I am not sold on the diced chicken.   I thought the tortillas should be fried a bit too.   The pancakes were okay.  Nothing incredible.   Maybe I was expecting more because of all the reviews but I found it to be just okay.   HOWEVER, if you like Hawaiian breakfasts, then this may be your place to go.  Loco Moco was very good."}
{"text":"Love the food but the staff is a bit iffy
I usually get my food to go & with no special requests - just a straight forward item or 2 plus I ALWAYS tip even tho they don't do anything really.. How is it that eggs Benedict was served to me with scrambled eggs?! The cashier owned up for the mistake but also admitted she was hoping I wouldn't notice! (& she was NOT joking either) Plus the cashier couldn't calculate the tip I left asking me how much it was for?! I will Nvr understand ordering food ahead of time just to sit & wait & wait... I'm really annoyed right now.
So I got the food & they still found another way to screw us- no hash browns! lol but I gotta admit- food was still bomb!"}
{"text":"4 stars to start, only because I've only been there once. If future visits remain consistently good, I'll up it!

The banana cream pie pancakes were amazing! I also had a taste of the red velvet pancakes, which were just as good. This place also knows how to make some of the best bacon ever! Praise bacon!"}
{"text":"Isn't the best I've had. But it's definitely good. The service is great, and the food comes out quick even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast from out of town because of good Yelp reviews. We were very disappointed. Hubby had the corned beef hash which is house made but with canned corned beef and was salty. The lemon ricotta pancakes were not crepe like, they were just flat pancakes which were just ok. The buttermilk pancakes weren't even hot, and they were thick and rubbery. Service was fair. Prices are high and not worth it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"BabyStacks has great food and is very clean. I'd recommend the red velvet pancake or the chocolate chip pancake, it is the best! Everything is great but the croweds. It's always so crowded at BabyStacks. You mostly have to wait like at least 25 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"A must visit when in vegas! Cute place with great service and excellent food! The carrot cake and cinnabun pancakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"Best place u could have breaksfast at. don't expect much on the services, coz everybody is busy. they could forget to give u ur drink, which they did to me. but that doesn't matter, I was there for food, not the service."}
{"text":"Babycakes, Babycakes, Babycakes...

Red velvet pancakes, red velvet pancakes, red velvet pancakes....

These words have been dancing around in my head for months now ever since I read a bunch of reviews about this place. I finally got the chance this morning to go to Babycakes and discover if all my lingering dreams of RVP's would come true and they definitely did.

My boyfriend and I arrived today (Sunday) at about Noon and the place was packed. I knew as soon as we drove up that we would be waiting, but never the less we were going to eat here no matter what. It ended up being a 30 minute wait, actually not bad for a brunch on a Sunday in my opinion. Would I wait that long during a week day? I'm not so sure.

After our wait we were escorted to a table in their very small dining room. Yes, this place is TINY! 

I ordered the Huntington Omelet and I upgraded to the red velvet pancakes ($1.50 to do so), and my boyfriend got the full-stack of RVPs. Okay, so all the hype is true - these pancakes are freaking amazing. My boyfriend said he liked his, but he didn't finish the whole plate. Probably because they're extremely rich. 

But here's what I really liked, their omelet and and serving of hasbrowns were perfect sized. Not too much, not too little. It's not like going to IHOP where they bring you out an omelet the size of your head that you're never going to finish. I appreciate that. 

The prices were spot-on, the service was super sweet (they kept my coffee filled, always a plus!), and the food was DELISH. 

Babycakes, Babycakes, Babycakes,,,,,"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to babystacks and we will definitely be back. I thoroughly enjoyed the corned beef hash and my poached eggs were perfectly prepared. I also had the carrot cake pancakes and couldn't recommend them enough. My wife ordered the club with some stellar fries. Seriously,  those fries were the hit of the table.

Where this place really shined was the service. Valerie was excellent, and ensured that we had an amazing dining experience. Even the cashier struck up conversation and had a smile on his face throughout the transaction."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! A friend of mine told me to try carrot cake pancakes b/c she always goes to the Babystacks in Centennial Hills. They were dry, the eggs were flat and gross, turkey sausage were indescribable. Service was mediocre... My boyfriend ordered the piglet skillet with the eggs well done; the eggs were burnt... I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my spouse and other friends of ours. I anticipated the wait (20-30 min) and didn't mind because I will wait for good food and look the menu over. Once seated we ordered. I ordered the spinach Benedict with garlic rice and a strawberry crepe. Once everything arrived I went for the crepe and tasting the rice and thought, yum pretty good but I was craving the spinach Benedict. I go to cut into my poached eggs and they are way over hard. When the server finally came over to check on us (after waiving at them) I showed him my hard boiled eggs and now cold food. My spouse now at this point is about done with her food. I turn down the remake (microwave and maybe correct eggs).  You only get 1 , 1 first impression. I gave 1 star because that's about what I ate and my thoughts on my 1st time there. Vegas has many options for food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's small and homely. Tucked away in a shopping center on Stephanie. Great food! Awesome staff! You have to try the red velvet pancakes and/or the Kalua grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly, adobo fried rice was bomb.  Red velvet and cinnabon pancakes were also very good.  Pork eggs benedict was good, although, portion was a bit tiny for me."}
{"text":"There was a 20 min wait! But as they say good things comes to those who wait... I got the red velvet pancakes with its light flavorful whip cream and a side of cream cheese topper and it was heaven!!!"}
{"text":"This place was all the hype so I went with a friend to check it out. The first thing I noticed were all of the handwritten signs saying sorry for this inconvenience or that... It was a bit distasteful and didn't make the best first impression. No split checks, no seating partial parties, no this, that, and the other. So many rules everywhere it distracts from the ambiance of a laid back breakfast/lunch café. Anyways. The food looked great that they brought out to everyone else but I guess I ordered the most lackluster dish on the menu, a turkey club and a side salad. It was something I could have made at home and made better at that but it was good. Just nothing even remotely special or unique to their menu. It was literally deli turkey, avocado and a tomato on two slabs of sara lee. I guess next time I give them a try (I am not opposed to trying it again) I will have to order one of the skillets, or pancake creations it seemed like those were served up with a bit more pride and creativity. Service was adequate but nothing that stood out or made me have a positive reaction to the service portion. Just average across the board."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we came here. The husband and I only have one day off a week together, so we occasionally enjoy a nice breakfast out. But, I've gotten to the point that national chain eateries don't impress me anymore. Additionally, our daughter is really finicky and breakfast is not her favorite meal. We've eaten here twice now and have enjoyed our meals. The pancakes are fluffy just like they should be. The kahlua grilled cheese was to die for. And, our  daughter loves the spam and eggs with an extra serving of rice instead of potatoes. Yay!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. I'm speechless!
A friend was raving about this cafe, so based on her recommendation I gave it a try this morning for breakfast. 
First off, I have been in hospitality for years and know what good high quality food is supposed to look and taste like. 
Unfortunately this was some of the worst I've ever had. The corned beef hash was over salted and even when mixing some of the egg yolk in, was barely edible. I was excited to try their homemade Kalua pork which came highly recommended by a very nice server. Sadly, it was soupy and slimy with a faint smoke flavor added. The pancakes were the worst I've ever had and interestingly this cafe prides itself offering a vast variety of them. They were a tough and chewy inedible disaster. They looked nice and fluffy, however so much baking soda was added to give them their beautiful appearance, that it completely destroyed the flavor. I want to taste buttermilk or a hint of sweetness, not salty baking soda. And let's talk about the side of fruit, when I thought it could not get any worse. The fruit was old and obviously has been sitting in the fridge for days. Rubbery translucent cantaloupe and honeydew and old strawberry slices. I normally do not complain but I did end up speaking to the manager. Although dressed as server she, did agree with everything I said, confirmed the fruit was cut yesterday and has been refrigerated and also agreed with the horrible pancakes and Kalua pork. My meal was comped and she thanked me for bringing this to her attention. Amazingly the place was packed and based on the items I have tried I don't even want to imagine what the rest of the menu tastes and looks like. 
If you need help to raise your food quality and standards, I've also been a restaurant consultant for years and would be happy to assist. Sadly, this was atrocious..."}
{"text":"this is a place where all the locals go, and i love it. i'm in the center of both locations, and both are great! I believe the blue diamond location is a bit bigger than the buffalo one. However the food is still at the top quality. 

There is a large variety of menu options. I always have a hard time choosing what I want to eat, because I always crave anything from them. If you're looking to eat something sweet and savory, I would go with ordering a plate on the back (ex: Spam & eggs) that plate already comes with hashbrowns/potatoes AND a side of buttermilk pancakes (which you can upgrade!!) 

I always go with the Spam & Eggs, with hashbrowns & Red velvet pancakes.

The adobo fried rice is super yummy as well (however it is more on the salty side, so it's better to have if youre sharing). 

White chocolate macadamia pancakes & banana foster pancakes are 11/10. Love how they are not too sweet. 

The service is normally spectacular, but people have their days. There are normally long waits as well- since it is where locals go most of the time. Yet, That still won't stop me from coming since the food is so great!"}
{"text":"Met two friends at this location this morning. The food was excellent. About 2 to 3 hours later, all 3 of us reported to each other we had food poisoning and the same symptoms. I've been tasting the adobo fried rice and eggs all day. :("}
{"text":"Nothing like CAKE for breakfast!!

We ordered the Kahluah Pig Benedict and the Chick Skillet with Red Velvet Pancakes. The service was good. The server was prompt and polite, always there to refill coffee.
The food came out quick enough, the portions weren't enormous like many breakfast places do. The Benedict was good enough, the pig was tender, cabbage just slightly crunchy. The poached egg was poached hard (Not runny) which I like a little more runny, but that's ok, and I could always go for more hollandaise! haha!
As I had seen mentioned in another post, the hashbrowns suck. They're a thin layer of potatoes crisped on the top side, mushy on the bottom. Meh.

The skillet sucked terribly. The \"chick\" aka, chicken, was in the form of 3 small pieces. VERY disappointing! (Mentioned it to the server, and it was taken care of, but besides the point) They did not skimp at all on the benedict, but the skillet was a wash.

The Red Velvet cakes were amazing. But then, who doesn't like eating birthday cake for breakfast? Because seriously, that's what it is. Sugary mess of yum.  And honestly, not impressed. I can nuke some birthday cake in the microwave and call it a day.

All in all, I don't plan on returning, thanks anyways!"}
{"text":"The only entree I order from here is the Loco Moco. If I had to choose one breakfast dish for the rest of my life, this would be the meal. The loco moco is a  definite must try (poached eggs-medium, garlic rice, seasoned potatos)."}
{"text":"Can you saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay Red Velvet Pancaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakes!!! I can.  Me and my family went here for breakfast on 5/3/12 and after 6 months of researching for a great place to eat breakfast in Vegas i was set on Babaycakes after reading about thier red velvet pancakes.  Yum!  Im a fanatic about awesome breakfast and red velvet cake so to find a place that puts both of things together in to one dish made my day.  I got the long stack which came with six pancakes and a heaping scoop of whipped cream, butter and these chocolate chip coco nib things.  When i bit in to it the cakes were nice and warm and had just the perfect amount of sweetness with the cream cheese syrup.  Perfection.  The whipped cream and cocoa nib things were just the perfect amount of sweetness and was not overly sweet especially for me a person who doesnt have a sweet tooth.  It was heaven on a plate.  When i was done i felt very fool and satisfied with nothing left on my plate.  My lady had the breakfast burrito and it was really good espcially because i have a high standard for breakfast foods and its hard to mess it up.  My daughters shared the usual which was scrambled eggs, sausage and the regular pancakes.  My mother inlaw had portuguese sausage and french toast and she really liked it she said it reminded her of home and made her feel like she never left Maui lol.  
     All the food was exceptional for diner food and the prices were very reasonable.  Babycakes is a little restaurant outside the Las Vegas strip probably a 13 min. drive but well worth it.   The atmosphere and decor is like a typical diner. but more hip because it has a flat screen tv lol.  The service was exceptional and attentive and our waiter was very nice and patient and hooked it up with some crayons and paper for my girls.  Our food took about 15 mins which is not that long but like the drive its well worth the wait for it.  All the food came out hot and steaming although the presentation isnt anything to write home about, but once you take that first bite, devine!  Are you drooling yet???
     I highly recommend this place for breakfast people especially for those that love red velvet cake.  When you pull up to this place it seems like its a hole in the wall but once you walk in its a whole different world.  I believe its one of the best breakfast spots in the area and even though its away from the strip it creates a suspence so dramatic that once you get there you wish it didnt end lol.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh so full...pumpkin pancakes, banana & peanut butter pancakes on the side with veggie omelette and potatoes. Potatoes not homemade fresh but my brother had hash browns that looked homemade.  He had ranchero omelette and inhaled it so must have been good....he said needed more spice.  Excellent server Nicole."}
{"text":"When you're out of town and you're in Vegas, you just want to be in the middle of the action and be on the strip. Going anywhere outside the strip just seems sketchy, right?
We wanted to meet up a couple of friends, who are both locals, for brunch. We suggested going to the buffet at The Cosmopolitan and they both gave us these hesitant, unsure faces. They suggested going to this local mom and pops place instead, which is off the strip. Then it was my turn to give the hesitant, unsure look. But when they mentioned \"Adobo fried rice\" and \"red velvet pancakes\", I was convinced.

Baby Stacks is a small restaurant located in a shopping strip. I was told it was originally named \"Baby Cakes\", but people kept thinking it was a bakery so they had to change the name.  The place definitely looks like an unpretentiously casual, local diner. Nothing fancy, no frills. Scanning the menu, the theme of the restaurant seemed to be Hawaiian with items like \"Loco moco\" and \"Kalua pork egg benedict\".

Our server, Lori (or Laurie, Lawry, Lorie, Loree...), who was a very agreeable lady came to take our orders. I decided on getting the \"Loco Moco with garlic fried rice\", my bf got the \"Adobo fried rice\" and we both got half a stack of the Red Velvet cupcakes.

I loved EVERYTHING! I was surprised with how I shamelessly devoured everything, considering that I have a very little stomach for food. Maybe, it's my genetic predisposition to love white rice.

The Loco Moco has 2 solid beef patties atop rice. (It originally comes with steamed rice but I strongly suggest you get the garlic fried rice instead.) 2 eggs go on top of everything while smothered by some tasty gravy! Ultimate comfort food!!!
The adobo fried rice is genius idea! You get fried rice mixed with chicken adobo pieces (you can also do garlic fried rice) wrapped in beaten egg. Exactly, it is an adobo fried rice omelet.
The Red Velvet pancakes were the perfect way to finish our meal! You think you wouldn't have room for it? Think again! The half stack comes with 3 pancakes while the full stack comes with 6. The pancakes are sprinkled with mini chocolate chips with a side of sweet cream cheese sauce. 
I am soooo glad I was convinced to get off the strip. You can almost never go wrong with mom and pops restaurants. *BURRRP!*"}
{"text":"YAY a BabyStacks in Henderson!!!!



   I enjoyed BabyStacks with my PIC a few years ago when we did a Vegas trip. When I came back, I told my Mom and baby sis, you have to come here! I didn't know they had one in Henderson until my mother told me they had one when they moved out there themselves. They're anti Vegas so this was perfect and even more perfect that they're only a mile from my moms house.

  I have no clue how I was able to be alive for this breakfast since I woke up at 3am and drove to Henderson with my girlfriends and never took a nap LOL. But my hunger was soooooooo strong, it overcame the sleep deprivation HAHA.  Surprisingly I wasn't even hangry especially walking up and seeing the crowd of people waiting. No biggie, put my name on the list and we sat on the bench at a neighboring eatery. I will say, for the most part, the service folks out here are really nice because, while we were waiting a staffer from the other restaurant greeted us even though we weren't there for them . We thought we were going to get the boot lol. So we get called and the guy asked if it were ok to eat in the patio. No problem with that and that was for the best because being a party of 2, you're seated earlier and inside is cramp for my taste so my mom and I actually had privacy to eat like pigs if we wanted :D The service here is great and they keep it together even with the crazy breakfast crowd. I don't recall our servers name but she was one of the sweetest servers ever and did so well with a party with 7 kids!!!!


   Ok now for the food. You have A LOT of options , so if you can't find something, something is wrong with you.  I didn't want to go overboard like I did when I came to the other location with my PIC. So I kept it simple with a straight forward breakfast. This came with sausage, hash browns topped with pepperjack , scrambled eggs and two naked pancakes with a side of butter and syrup. My mom ordered egg whites, cheddar hashbrowns, toast and Portuguese sausage . It was a nice out and we only waited a few minutes for our food. Food comes out fresh and hot. Looks great! We dig in and everything tastes so good!!!! The pancakes were good but Snooze am in San diego is number one for me in the simple pancake category :) I'll still eat their pancakes all day! Their sausage patties are my favorite kind, nice sharp taste of fennel and so juicy mmmmmmm.  My mom LOVED her food, it was solid. 

  We didn't go fancy schamancy like most people do when they come here, all those pancakes loaded with rich toppings and or heavier breakfast items. We wanted simple and we got that and thensome. So good and hit the spot.  We left more than satisfied and I went home and took a nice loooooong nap :D  I'd come back to their small chain everytime I'm in the 702 :D"}
{"text":"This place deserves a 5 because I over ate like a mofo and got sick for doin so LOL


 So the PIC was so over that brekie from Bouchon the day before so he wanted something off the strip. I fired up the yelp and it was between that and some other spot but these pictures from here won me over!

 I don't know Vegas and what part we were in but getting there was almost nuts because it was flooded getting there. Damn storm in Vegas kinda ruined my Vegas mojo. Oh well. So found the spot in a shopping center next to a donut shop I wanted to get a donut BUT the food coma after this orgasmic meal stopped that LOL.

 Since this was a weekday brekie, we didn't have to deal with the weekend rush that I kept reading about, so :p Walked in and sat at the counter so I can watch some tv while stuffin my face. The service was good . We had a dude that I think may have ran the place himself or family. Anywho scaled the menu and was drooling over the options. So typical me :D  Finally  we figured out what we wanted after trying to figure it out for damn near 15 minutes. My fault HA!

   I opted for the build your own skillet. With the eggs ,spinach,bacon,mushrooms and cheese. Under that is a bed of breakfast potatoes. I also added two red velvet pancakes for an additional charge. Still came with toast OH LAWRD LOL. Pic ordered the Ricks adobo fried rice and also we did a side of portugeuse sausage and kailua pork. Man this sounds like were some mad fat asses LOL.  So im getting excited for all this food to come out. Thank god we had the whole counter to ourselves HAHA. We start piggin out. My skillet was delish BUT I didn't care for all the potatoes under my fixins. I like hashbrowns much more than breakfast spuds. The eggs were nice and fluffy. I could have used more cheese but im a cheesehead LOL. The red velvet pancakes were CRACK! Thats pretty much did my tummy in! I kept eating them and eating them and eating them. I usually hate pancakes but these were OMAZING. The cream cheese syrup was so damn good! The chunks of chocolate chip with the batter and syrup made it a perfect bite! Damn now im starting to day dream about those.  The portueguese sausage was a good amount and cooked perfectly. The kailua pork was a lacking something, some kind of brown au jus with a touch of sweetness would have made it more enjoyable. His dish was  good as well but not the best fried rice. But still good and he ate it all!

  We walked out stuffed as hell and we were going to go shopping BUT I couldn't take knowing that I would have to walk amongst the crowds, so I said F it take me back to my room so I can sleep LOL. Can't wait to come back here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"With a soft spot for breakfast foods, my boyfriend and I tried this place for brunch. Pancakes?! Why not? 

We walked in, the staff was cordial but not really animated. We were not seated as promptly even though there were more than enough tables. With the aberration of the decor, the seating was uncomfortable when we were seated. Also, the waiter was a bit lethargic and nelgected to bring me the coffee I ordered till a I called him over 15 mintues later. 

As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the short Buttermilk pancakes and I had the Honey French Toast. The food was alright but the price was bit much for the French Toast ($8.50 for two slices of bread with no sides). 

Not exactly the place to be for a returned visit, as we will look to other places to try next. If you love breakfast foods of high cailber, try Squeeze In over by Easter and Pebble instead."}
{"text":"I came with my family since we were in the area for my daughter's soccer tournament. This place came up when I googled \"breakfast.\"  Small but quaint place.  The food is a Hawaiian/Filipino blend, which I liked since I'm Filipino. We had to wait for 15-20, which wasn't bad. The overall service was attentive and fast.  

There were a lot of choices from savory to sweet on the menu but the most impressive items on it were the pancake selections, there were so many to choose from since they all sound so good. I went with the German Chocolate pancakes and they are to die for.  I have been craving them since I left Vegas.  I wish they had a place like this in LA. 

Now if I go back to Vegas my \"must\" stop breakfast place will be Babystacks for sure!!  Maybe next time I will try the more savory stuff but definitely will get one of their pancakes choices as well."}
{"text":"The pancakes are to die for. Delicious. But don't come here for coffee....the coffee is awful! Very watery and low quality. But, I keep coming back because of the food (the Nutella crepe is very good too). Only 3 stars because, for me, a good cup of Joe in the morning , is essential."}

{"text":"The very first time I went the buffalo location and I  thought it was just ok. I found out they had another restaurant on Durango and not only is it around the corner but the restaurant bigger, all of their staff is always pleasant but I thought the quality of food was better at this location!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was cause I was hungover, but didn't see what was so special here.  Sure the red velvet pancakes are good, but not great.  Plus, we had to wait 1 hour just to get in on a Sunday morning.  The adobo fried rice was served in a gigantic portion but was medicore at best. Not the kind of place I look for when I want a good brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast, but be prepared for a wait on the weekends it gets really busy! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a yummy breakfast. We usually dine at the one in Centennial Hills"}
{"text":"All the food was good. I love eggs benedict and love trying different varieties. I got the kalua pig benedict. Rich hollandaise sauce and I got pancakes instead of potatoes -- the red velvet pancakes. I also got to try the macadamia pancakes and cornbeef hash. Everything was delicious and probably had a million calories. The coffee was just ok though. Service was great. Food arrived fast and coffee was filled timely. Thanks Santos!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We got so much food for a really good price. I left the restaurant so full and satisfied. There are so many varieties of just the pancakes alone that it was so hard to choose what I wanted. Everything sounded so good!

Their corned beef was delicious and my egg was cooked perfectly the way I ordered. I got the white chocolate pancakes--they were very sweet and incredibly delicious. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

The service was great, and everyone was incredibly friendly. They were happy to answer all of our million questions! I really enjoyed our experience there!"}
{"text":"They have a great menu I was sold on the place when I seen they had Portuguese sausage which not everyone has My daughter had there pancakes to sweet for me but she just love them You all need to go here for breakfast pretty damn tasty"}
{"text":"The food lived up to the hype and was delicious. Our waitress was friendly and knew the menu. The food was fresh and theybhave several original items. I wish it was bigger, but that's a me problem."}
{"text":"Omg. Every time I come to Vegas, I tell my best friend to take me here. This is one of the best places to go to for breakfast. Probably the best pancakes I've ever had. There is a large selection of pancakes to choose from; red velvet, cookies and cream, orange creamsicle, and s'mores are just some of the many choices you have. If you want even more food (which I always surrender myself to), you can order the entrees that include the pancakes of your choice. I've had the adobo fried rice omelet (holy moly it's big), spam fried rice with garlic, and chili moco. Everything on the menu is so much like Hawaiian style food, so you definitely get Hawaiian vibes when you dine here. There are three locations, and I've been to all of them. Service is usually consistent. Make sure to come when they first open, because the restaurants can get crowded."}
{"text":"Delicious food, not so good service from the greeter girls. One in particular had attitude, no smile, when apologizing for the wait (even though there were open tables!) she didn't seem to care. 
But the food I ordered- adobo fried rice and banana foster pancakes were so delicious it ALMOST had me forget about her terrible service, almost."}
{"text":"On New Year's day I really didn't want to cook any breakfast so we decided to go out.I was surprised Baby Stacks was crowded because I thought people would still be asleep at 9:30 am. Some of the people looked like they didn't sleep at all with their dresses and New Year's eve hats!

  I needed to go to a Hawaiian breakfast place this time because what I was craving you would not find in your local IHOP. I decided to wait the 30 minutes even though I was super hungry.

I ordered the Kalbi (beef short rib) , upgraded to the garlic fried rice and an over easy egg. I like to mix the egg yolk in my rice. (Learned habit from childhood) . It was delicious and just what I needed!

 I figured while I was there I would also get a side of their Lemon Ricotta crepes. It may  sound weird but spritz them with some lemon and drizzle some of the white sugary topping and you are set! I haven't encountered any crepes like this anywhere else in Vegas so I made sure to have some since I don't come here all the time. I also had the white chocolate/ macadamia nut pancakes . You can upgrade from a buttermilk pancake to one of their specialty cakes for a small price.   

The service is great even though it can get really busy .That being said please allow around  30 minute wait time ."}
{"text":"What happened to their Macaroni? It used to be really delicious but this time around it was really bland. That is the reason for the one star downgrade. It was disappointing because I was really looking forward to it. I couldn't eat it after two bites. 

The spam, egg whites and rice were yummy. I also tried their Lemon Ricotta crepes which were also good but a little thick. 

BabyStacks was still busy for a Friday but we didn't have to wait longer than 20 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Oh Mylanta! This is a place you need to put on your bucket list, it is different and amazing check it out.
I had the Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice Locals Favorite."}
{"text":"I've been to both this location and the one on Stephanie in Henderson. They both serve great food. I love their pancakes, especially the hazelnut ones. If calories didn't count, I could eat them every day. I also had the Mexican skillet at this location, which was very tasty and had a nice amount of spice. Our server was very pleasant, as was the one that took over when our original one took a break.

My only complaint was it was a little chilly in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pancakes were really good, we had the red velvet pancakes. Other than that I don't see what the hype is all about. I had the corned beef and it was insanely salty and my boyfriend had an omelet with potatoes that seemed half the size of the order from the table next to us. The wait to be seated and then the wait to get the food were about the same, 20-30mins. Would go back to try the other pancakes but not for anything else. Maybe our next experience will be better..."}
{"text":"The food was just as I hoped it would be from the other reviews I read. 
I ordered bacon and eggs breakfast.
Of course I had to upgrade to the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup.
The food was well worth the 25 min. Drive. 
Baby stacks would have gotten a rating of 5 stars, unfortunately the server had forgotten my request for an orange juice.  
The tables are too small for the large portions they serve.    
Other than that I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"This place is our favorite breakfast place in town. You get such great quality breakfast for the price. There are so many great selections on the menu. Worth the long wait."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My son loves the ricks fried adobo. I personally love the red velvet pancakes. It gets really busy on the weekends. I would recommend pickup."}
{"text":"We'd passed this place at least a dozen times and always remarked how we should try it -- and finally we did on Easter weekend.  It  was much smaller than we thought inside -- but not too crowded. Cozy, I'd call it.  But there are no booths, it's all table seating.

The staff was really nice and attentive as they could be considering it was pretty busy. We walked in around 10:30 on a Saturday morning, but we must've gotten lucky, because despite her saying it would be 20-25 minutes, we were seated within 5 minutes. Not too shabby.

I ordered the Mexican Omelette with buttermilk pancakes instead of toast.  The omelette was delicious -- could've been a little spicier or maybe had another elements, like pico de gallo, but I just hit it with some Tabasco and all was well. Delicious carnitas, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and topped with sour cream. Yum. I'd order it again, for sure.

I'm kind of picky about my pancakes. So many places make them heavy or dense or way, way, WAY too big. I don't need silver dollars, but I prefer them smaller than my face.  These are the exact right size, especially to accompany eggs.

I wanted to try the red velvet pancakes everyone raves about. The guy at the table across from us ordered them and they looked amazing.  Babystacks lets you get a specialty pancake instead of just buttermilk in lieu of toast, but I figured if this is a breakfast joint that specializes in pancakes, I should start with the basics. If their buttermilk pancakes are good, the rest probably are, too.  And they were good! I ate them both and ended up bringing home most of my omelette.

Next time, I'd like to try the lemon ricotta stacks or the red velvet. There are really so many to choose from, though i'm not much of a dessert-for-breakfast type of girl, so I likely won't try them all.

But I'll definitely be back -- it was comparably priced with places like Cracked Egg just up the street.  And while I love Cracked Egg, Babystacks will provide a nice alternative, especially when I really want pancakes."}
{"text":"Great place when you go there will be a wait I have never got lucky in no wait but love there pancakes especially the bacon pancakes"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes was amazing!! This restaurant offers great portion sizes!!! I definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Banana's Foster really good!! I also ordered the Baby chic omelette it was ok lacked seasoning, seasoned potatoes were ok. Overall food was good."}
{"text":"I know EVERY review talks about the red velvet pancakes. Yes, we HAD to try them. You can't vacation in Vegas and drive an hour out on your last day to come to a random ass cafe and NOT try their specialty item.

I thought the pancakes would be too sweet, but they were perfect. My boyfriend and I split the red velvet pancakes and the specialty eggs benedict. I credit this place for introducing me to eggs benedict. I've always wanted to try them and never had until now. So. So. So. Good :)

There were tons of great sounding dishes on the menu but we had to choose something. If I ever make it back to town again, I look forward to diving into some of the other yum yums. 

I really liked the coffee mugs here, so... I bought one for $5 as a souvenir :)"}
{"text":"This place has some bomb pancakes!!! 
Its a tiny restaurant but it does get busy.  
We were so indecisive on what to eat here because the menu has a lot of options.  

We did breakfast combos with babystacks.  Kalua pig and cabbage benedicts, biscuits and gravy, and the Sausage Burrito with portuguese sausage.  We got each entree with a shortstack of pancakes.  The red velvet, cinnabon, and bananas foster.  They were all delicious.   The banana fosters was my personal favorite.  It wasnt too sweet but it was sweet enough.  I had the sausage burrito and i enjoyed it.  The kalua benedicts were also awesome!!!!! I didnt think that it would be good with cabbage but suprisingly good.  

The price was good for the amount and taste of food you get and the service was superb.  We had Chris so ask for him!!! He was really awesome."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday, about 9:30..... they weren't very busy... plenty of empty tables.
We sat down right away, waitress came over got our drink order. Then they asked us to move tables to accommodate a large party. No big deal we didn't mind helping out, except then they squeezed us in the tiniest table in-between others, when there was still plenty of empty tables. UGH....
Food was average... if that...
Wheat toast was BAD!! Inedible!! (EAT, downtown has spoiled me forever on REAL toast) but this was stale and hard. YUCK! Eggs were not good, tasted horrible!
My husband had the breakfast burrito, he said it was average. 
Better breakfast at several other places in town!"}
{"text":"Lord I don't even know where to start. Honestly I was really excited about this place with the large line formed outside it gives you the feeling of a great meal ahead. But you sit down in a very uncomfortable chair at a fairly small table. The service was decent but not great honestly it was just non memorable at the least. Then we get to the food I don't care what they say these are processed products and there is nothing special about that I can go to a mcdonalds and get that kind of breakfast. The omelet was decent but again besides the eggs seemed like processed food inside the chili was just plain gross honestly. This restaurant is really close to my house but I am just not ever going to bother waiting to eat here again not worth the wait in the least."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Yelpers, you guys rock for sharing about a great place like Babystacks!

We're from the SF Bay Area and we've had a few visits to Las Vegas the past year.  We're so over the usual stuff and just wanted to find a good breakfast that wasn't on the strip.  We Yelpers know that some of the best food can be found off the beaten path, right?  So my trusty Yelp App not only roped me in with an eye catching menu that had pancake choices like Smores, Banana Creme Pie, Red Velvet (cue eye pop here) but it also told me that this place is about 15 minutes from our hotel.  Sweet!  Off we go in our rental.

Probably because we went on a weekday, we didn't experience a lengthy wait as mentioned in the other reviews.  During the 5 minutes we did have to hang out, I noticed the clean, casual & laid back surroundings with a bit of an island touch.  Cute butterflies everywhere.  I also saw the specials on the board and I knew I was in for a dilemma.  Almond Joy pancakes?  Orange creamsicle pancakes?  I asked for a menu to have an early look but by that time we were ready to be seated.

I got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  It only comes in one size, and the order was HUGE.  The cream cheese syrup made each bite delightfully sweet and really went with the lemony, fluffy pancake. My leftovers: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RIYUD4i-_sPDH597B92DXg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg

The huzbeau ordered the Kalua Pork Eggs Benedict.  I liked my pancakes, but I was coveting his plate the whole time.  The pork was tender and nicely salted with perfectly poached eggs.  I've never had this rendition of Eggs Benedict before and its a work of genius!  If it were me though, I'd throw in some spam in there (which I did order on the side; comes with two slices).  Note to self for the next time.  And I'm definitely getting my own. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wgy9HFmRWyhY8IupO76RHw&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg

The Keikis enjoyed a short stack of Almond Joy pancakes (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RziSeEnGuGZ-SfEMFhZXrg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg) and the combo meal that came with bacon, hash browns, eggs and a red velvet baby stack (no picture, sorry...my little girl inhaled it).  

Everything was delicious.  We may have ventured off the strip, but we made our own smorgasbord here.  Service was sufficiently friendly and there is plenty of parking.  We will definitely be back when we visit this area again!"}
{"text":"The wait here is pretty long, unless you have a party of two.  My party of three probably waited at least 30 minutes.  It kinda sucked bc we'd see parties of two arrive way after us but get seated right away.  :(  It's not their fault that they have many more two-person tables, but it was still irritating.  

Anyway, once we were finally seated, we ordered pretty quickly.  You get a side of buttermilk pancakes with most orders (a stack of two) and can pay a small fee to upgrade to a flavored one.  I think they should offer an option to get one pancake bc I saw a lot of people leave a ton of leftovers due to the amount of food.  I got the Chili Omelet, which had Zippy's Chili (my favorite from Hawaii!) on top and inside.  Though there was Zippy's Chili inside, I wish they put more on top.  It was pretty basic - just an omelet filled with Zippy's!  Good but not great.  The has browns were really good, though, as they were crispy and not soggy.  I also upgraded to the Red Velvet pancakes, which came with a deliciously sweet whipped cream (they must make it there bc it def did not taste like the canned kind), chocolate bits, and cream cheese sauce on the side.  The cream cheese sauce was super sweet, but I liked it, though the whipped cream was probably enough.  Pancakes were light and fluffy and really good.  My friends got the chili verde omelet, which she found to be very average, and my other friend got spam and eggs.  I can fry spam myself at home, so I never order it out, but she had a craving for it.  One friend got a side of buttermilk pancakes, which she said was good.  Food came quickly, and we ate just as quickly since another line was building up.  The place had a constant flow of people coming in.  I can see why, though.  I'd definitely eat here again, even though it's a bit of a trip off the strip!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. Everything at this place was great. The hash browns  were awesome,  pancakes- perfect with taste and fluffy. The eggs benedict came with a biscuit instead of an English muffin.  It was the best I ever had,  I love eggs benedict and have had many, this is the best. Coffee was great and that is important.  This is a definite must every trip, you can't go wrong. Great servers,  always in good moods, nice and sweet."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. We had the red velvet pancakes which were great, biscuits and gravy, and the fried rice omelet!! Jordan was our server and took care of us well. We would highly recommend. Thank you."}
{"text":"Been here several times for breakfast.  Food and service is ALWAYS excellent.  Amazing pancake selection.  The pig Benedict and banana pancakes is my usual."}
{"text":"By far my go to breakfast cafe. Really brings out the island vibes with the reggae music and great staff!"}
{"text":"I've always heard great things about this place. The first time we came in we waited awhile (as expected) but what threw me off was upon walking in, you literally have to fight to get your name on the wait list. There is no order, no organization, no one there to greet you. The \"hostess\" is the same person who is running the wait list, seating people and bagging to-go orders. On a busy Saturday/Sunday, that's just not reasonable. 

We came in with the whole family this past Saturday. Busy, again, as expected. We were quoted 30-35 minutes for a party of 5 with a highchair. Waited close to 50 minutes. The hostess was not friendly whatsoever and once we were finally seated, argued with my mother-in-law after she requested an extra chair. 

I will say, the service afterward was prompt and food was definitely good but just that initial first impression kills it all.

For a place that represents Hawaii - they don't show very much Aloha."}
{"text":"Eh its just not very good. no healthy options and their pancakes taste like foil..... i say just dont. with all the near by options try one of those"}
{"text":"Great food! Portions leave you a little hungry but that's my only critique. The staff has always been friendly and the corn beef with garlic rice is phenomenal I tell my out of towners to go here."}
{"text":"There's always a long wait here but soooo worth it. A must have is definitely the red velvet pancakes and honestly everything I have tried on the menu has been amazing!!"}
{"text":"RED VELVET PANCAKES! I don't even like pancakes and I would never choose to get pancakes, but these pancakes I absolutely love and can't get enough! Genius combining red velvet with pancakes! So good. Must get this is when you come here.  It comes with whipped cream with chocolate shavings and like this white syrup. I don't know how to explain what the white syrup is, but it compliments it really well. It taste similar to the normal frosting of a red velvet cake in syrup form.  

This normal breakfast dishes are good too! Small for the price, I think.  But the quality is noted.  I got the portuguese sausage with rice. MMM... Lots of Filipino influenced dishes on the menu.  I heard the Adobo omelet so bomb too."}
{"text":"We came when they first opened, it was just ok. Their pancakes were yummy . We came again 6 months ago and they've gotten better! Here again w my son, he wanted pancakes and I wanted something filling. I got my island food and he got his pancakes! Food is getting a little better and I'm glad for their business! Good variety of food here, servers are friendly and I like that they're allowed to have their own style and yet look clean in appearance :) our server had a poofy mushroom shaped hair and it was awesome! Lol."}
{"text":"someone just asked me what was the name of the restaurant that I ate Orange Creamsicle pancakes.  Well I came ot Yelp thinking I gave a review and I didn't.  I dont even have the pictures anymore....hmmm.
Anywho. OMG this place is amazing!!!!  I think I ordered the Sausage and Eggs and the pancakes came with them.  Hubby ordered the Build Your Own Omelette with the Honey Wheat Pancakes.  Everything was really fresh and the pancakes were out of this world. No words can describe the taste of those Orange Creamiscle pancakes and I tasted his Honey Wheat and they too were amazing.  
The only thing is the place is so small.  As soon as our food came the people next to us were lke ohhhh whats that with his nose almost touching my pancakes.  For that reason I will not go often.  I like to have some privacy when eating...give me at least an arm length apart.  If we wouldve both stuck out our arms, we could've hugged lol.  Other than that, great food!!!  May just order to go next time!"}
{"text":"Wanted a yummy breakfast on our day leaving Vegas.  Would compare this to Egg and I.  Hubby had Mexican scramble that was TDF.  Super tasty.  Kids chose short stack of smores and rocky road.  Smores tasted just like smores and moist, rocky road was a little more dry bc pancakes were chocolate.  I had Huntington omelette which was ok.  Not very much flavor or cheese.  Great service, but did have to wait 30 minutes to be seated but that is expected on Sunday @11 in Vegas!  Would go there again."}
{"text":"We used to LOVE going to BabyStacks everytime we visit Vegas.But our last visit on November 23rd didn't impress me anymore. I ordered Lola Cora's Corned Beef Hash & Eggs with an upgrade to the garlic rice. The garlic rice had RAW garlic that was over powering. Our waitress didn't even give us the specials for the day and didn't ask how our food was. She did  however come and refill our coffee. Maybe we have just outgrown this place. There's too many options in town."}
{"text":"Been hearing of this place for awhile now for the \"Local style\" menu selections like back home - HAWAII

We arrived close to lunchtime because i seen they had a late menu for breakfast on Sunday morning and they were pretty busy. For my little and myself we were sat right away. 

I already had an idea of what i wanted to order but still wanted to look over the menu. So many decisions.....Red Velvet pancakes, Kalua benedict, Loco Moco, etc.    Mmmmmmm. So ono! I opted for the BYO omelette (3 eggs, choice of 2 veggies, 1 meat and 1 cheese) thats alot of choices, i see alot of places will only give you 2 choices with 2 eggs where this place is 4 and 3 eggs!!!!! Score! It also came with potatoes and choice of toast or pancakes. I asked to swap my side to white rice of course and got the pancakes for her to eat instead of toast. Asked for Aloha Shoyu which they did have NO TO KIKKOMAN!!! Hahahahaha.

Food was awesome
Service was great and the local atmosphere was great. Local music playing throughout restaurant. Give this place a try! You will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Happy they opened up this place so close to us. Simple garlic rice with spam and eggs and red velvet pancakes on the side is my favorite dish there so far. The hubs likes the cookie butter French toast which was yummy but a little too rich after a few bites for me. We'll be definitely coming back to this place for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food and the pancakes are amazing!  Wasn't happy how the food didn't all come out at once or I  would have given this a five star.  Would definitely come back again!  :)"}
{"text":"Close to our crib in suburbia I ubered there for take out.  Cornbeef Hash with poached eggs, adobo omlette and a stash or portugese sausage and lashings of bacon.  Everything was packed in individual boxes so it would not get mushed up on the ride home.  The food came out in 10 minutes and I arrived home and was able to deliver a business breakfast like it had come out of a posh hotel.
Enough food for an army for $47 and super nice service"}
{"text":"Nope...not even up to the standards of Omelet House over on the Boulder Highway (The one loser to Russell Rd) and Omelet House has much better prices.   And the Pancake House in Green Valley Station puts them to shame.  Banana pancakes should have the bananas cooked in, not on top.  Also served so cold they can't melt butter.   1st and last trip for me."}
{"text":"Babystacks is a pretty solid breakfast place.  I ordered the huevos rancheros with green chile sauce. It was pretty tasty, but not quite spicy enough for me. The waiter said that the green chile sauce is the spicier of the two, but I think next time I'll go with the red sauce. I got hash browns with my meal, which were AMAZING!! Really, some of the best hash browns I've had. 

My girlfriend ordered the red velvet pancakes. She enjoyed them quite a bit. I'm not much of a cake person, but they were pretty good. It was like eating cake for breakfast - which is something I always looked forward to as a kid after a birthday party. I couldn't see myself eating a whole meal, but the few bites I had sure were tasty. 

We also ordered the adobo fried rice with the intention of taking it to go. We didn't realize that it was an omelette with fried rice in it. We apparently didn't read the menu very well since it says that it's adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg. I guess I just assumed that most fried rice has egg bits in it and didn't think that it would be an omelette. Pretty interesting take on fried rice. It was pretty good, too. It didn't really have much of the adobo flavor I'm used to, but I liked it. 

Overall, Babystacks is good. The service was great and the staff members were very friendly.  I've been wanting to try it for a while now and I'm glad I did. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"BabyStacks Café helps to remind me that you can still get great breakfast grub in the city that never sleeps. The only miss on 5 stars is the cramped seating, but I understand their need with their long wait times.

We first ate here on a Saturday morning, and almost turned away because of the wait, but I'm sure glad that we stuck around for the 15 minutes, because it was well worth it. While their seating area is small, and crowded in some places, the overall feel is great, and the attention to customer needs in flawless.

The big pull factor for me is their food. I've been there three times, and each time I've gotten different flavors of pancakes. I've always gone with their Mexican Skillet, which is tasty, salty, a little spicy with some fresh Jalapeños, and the perfect portion. I like that they offer the option to upgrade all the buttermilk pancakes that come with a breakfast to the \"premium flavors\". I've had the red velvet, orange creamsicle, pumpkin, s'mores, and carrot cake. (I go with my wife, we each get a different one and share). They are so good, I could order these for desert after a meal! 

All in all, a great place. We've had all three locations, and there are no flukes, the food and employees are consistent. If you're looking for a great place, and you love pancakes, this is right up your alley!"}
{"text":"I'm guessing I had all my calorie intake for the day... Definitely worth it! Red velvet pancakes were amazing! Guys up front were friendly, our waitress was great. I'd definitely have breakfast here again. Cons small place but again it was great! Packed."}
{"text":"Just had a great breakfast at Babystacks! Had The pork adobo fried rice omelette and a short stack of pancakes. Friendly and personable service from Cassandra. My friends had the fresh corn beef hash, garlic rice, pancakes and eggs. We rolled out of there totally content. Everything on the menu also looks delicious and tasty. Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"I think this place has potential but they are very small and seem disorganized. The food is good, our meals came out quickly, and they were hot and tasted good. There always seems to be a wait even on a weekday so that says something about the loyalty of their customers. I think the potatoes are a little dry, although the seasoning is good. Will try it again for sure, but on a day that maybe isn't so busy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have two locations one on Stephanie and another one Blue Diamond. Both locations are small and always packed. But packed for a reason, they have a variety of dishes all good for breakfast and lunch. 
I tried to keep it simple and I ordered the Kaula Pork grilled sandwich, instead of ordering French fries like usual, I upgraded my side to a babystack of pancakes. I settled for Ricky Road, and I was super glad. The pancakes were rich and full of goodies- marshmallows, Chocolate syrup, almond slivers and whip cream.  I almost was able to finish one stack until my son ate the rest, my lil Chocolate monster stole my stack.  But it was okay the Sourdough grilled sandwich filled with kaula Pork was good and fulfilling.  I left the table full and content.
My husband ordered the Portuguese omelette and love it, he was torn on ordering the Kalbi short ribs- but the waiter suggested the omelette and my husband enjoyed his omelette and was very full. His omelette almost looked like a burrito filled with sausage and veggies. 

My son ordered the quesadilla and he was a happy camper, he wasn't a fan of the fries, because they were topped with seasoning salt, so his fries were red and not the usual color. Maybe not a big deal to most, but for picky eaters it is.  Was I mad? Nope- more fries for me while he ate my pancakes:/
So overall the restaurant usually has a wait, and the locations are small. So seating can cause the lines of waiting long.  Is it worth the wait? Yes- Yes it is. Is the food good? Yes-Yes it is Would I come back again- Yes- Yes I would....."}
{"text":"So we kept hearing about the this awesome location from friends and from some gals from the Las Vegas Moms Blog. So we took a chance and came, I was so happy that we finally made our way here. The menu has a very big selection on pancakes and they all look yummy. So in our first visit I tried the Red Velvet and it was sooooo good, even my picky eater was curious and he ended up taking my last stack and only left me with half a pancake, I loved the cream cheese glaze, it wasnt too sweet and it complimented the pancake, so I can see why it is there best seller. I also took a chance with the Kaluia grilled cheese sandwhich, and it was awesome. I am not a fan of sourdough but the bread and cheese complimented the pork and added good texture and flavor. So today I am trying the breakfast burrito with Kaluia pork and the bacon on  the side, and an order of cinnamon bun pancakes.  I will update this review once I taste my customized burrito and unique pancake. But so far I am really digging this place it has an american, Filipino Hawaiian twist, and it really works out, especially if the Filipino in you wants rice with your food."}
{"text":"I loved every bite. Large portions, good service, CLEAN. I would definitely go back. You better bring your appetite with you"}
{"text":"I seriously don't know what is the deal with this location because the summerlin one is great. BUT this one needs help and I am so bummed that after all the anticipation of them opening in Centennial, this location has turned out to be a serious disappointment. First time I ate there it was take out and  I ordered the strawberry pancakes and may lightning strike me dead if I did not get home to find a freakin shortstack of plain pancakes WITH TWO STRAWBERRIES CUT IN HALF!!!!! AND THAT WAS IT FOR THE STRAWBERRIES IN MY STRAWBERRY PANCAKES!!! 
Second time ate in. Ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. BURNED BURNED BURNED! Ya know for a pancake place this place SUCKS! I don't know if it's poor management or lazy chefs or both but geez! I'm not sure I want to go for the third times a charm factor."}
{"text":"An hour wait was worth it!  I had the Mexican omlette - delicious with a fresh pico de gallo on top.  My only complaint was that I wish it was fresh jalapeno and not pickled inside the omlette. Subbed the house pancakes for red velvet and omg...mouth watering and taste-gasm. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best breakfast spots in Vegas! The red velvet pancakes are to die for and the Cinnabon pancakes were delicious also. They need to open a location near my house in Silverado ranch!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! They didn't lie about the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup! So good. A little pricey for breakfast, but they give lots of food. They even gave us to-go cups for our drink refills!"}
{"text":"The lightest most tender pancakes I can remember having. We got the bananas foster and lemon ricotta. The BF were sublime. Bacon was also perfect. Great service and good atmosphere. The wait is a bit long,  but legitimately worth it. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet.  I like this place, but the prices are a bit much for me for breakfast.  

I'm a local girl that is used to making the rice plates at home, so thats my take away from my rating.  I've seen how small their omelets are and giggled to myself.  If they know people from the islands, that's a pupu size portion.  Pupu as in appetizer.

Their carrot cake pancakes, bomb.  I can never make up my mind between having eggs or pancakes, so I go for the combo.  I do the Portuguese sausage, or cornbeef hash, eggs, and garlic rice with an upgrade of carrot cake pancakes.  

I've tried the Kalua Benedict.  Eeeeeh, its okay.  I say that because if you have had Cinnamon's in Kailua, its hard to get that anywhere else.  My Kalua Pig always seems to be dry.  Like its been sitting under the heat for too long.  

Like most breakfast joints, this place gets very busy.  So if you do come with a large group, you will find yourself waiting for awhile.  Same like the bathroom, there is only one.  

Will I return, yes.  I crave their carrot cake pancakes.  Oh, don't forget to look on the board. Sometimes they have specially made pancakes for the day/month."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast on my first morning in Vegas. Nice small place with super friendly and welcoming staff. Food was very good and better than expected. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Get in early as it doesn't stay open beyond early afternoon. Good variety is great and tastes are delicious. Worth it."}
{"text":"I finally tried BabyStacks Cafe, based on a recommendation of a couple of friends of mine. Boy, was I in for a great treat. Excellent customer service, reasonable prices and delicious food. A unique concept that is a nice break from your traditional diner food cafe. They offer Filipino and Hawaiian style breakfast and lunch specialties, along with American breakfast classics. They are also known for their Red Velvet Pancakes and Adobo Fried Rice. 

I went in for breakfast and I had the eggs with Portuguese sausage and home fries. The sausage was well cooked, the fries were crispy with a good  amount of seasoning, and my eggs were cooked perfectly to my specifications of over easy. 

My special came with butter milk pancakes or the option to upgrade to a specialty pancake. I decided to indulge and went for the lemon ricotta crepe style pancakes. Oh my...so darn good!! They were served with a lemon glaze syrup sauce and dusted with powdered sugar. Perfect size, not too sweet and the lemon glaze had a nice tang to it. 

I will definitely come back, as I would like to try their bananas foster pancakes on my next visit. They just sound so heavenly and my waitress highly recommended them.  I highly recommend BabyStacks Cafe. They have several locations throughout the Las Vegas valley. I dined at the Buffalo and Durango location."}
{"text":"Great food as always & less wait time to sit down since the sq ft is larger than the buffalo location."}
{"text":"One of the biggest reasons we go to Vegas is to explore all the food options. You may be surprised how much of a foodie town Las Vegas is, well beyond the Strip. This last trip, we went to Babycakes Cafe (@BabycakesCafeLV), which is about 20 minutes off the Strip. Their claim-to- fame is pancakes inspired by popular cupcake flavors -- you know it was a must-try for Kim.

The pancakes were really good. They were light and fluffy but packed full of flavor. You can tell they put a lot of care into their pancakes and perfecting cupcake-like pancake batters. They had many flavors like lemon ricotta, peanut butter, strawberry and we had a hard time choosing. We decided to go with red velvet and carrot cake pancakes. Both were awesome and served with a cream cheese syrup. One suggestion for them, selfishly speaking, would be to create a pancake sampler to give customers an opportunity to try a variety of their flavors. We had to order two separate dishes just so we could taste more than one of their flavors.

In addition to cupcake pancakes and traditional breakfast menu items, they also have Filipino and Hawaiian-inspired dishes. I ordered Rick's adobo fried rice. This is a Filipino dish that includes shredded chicken adobo and fried rice, wrapped in egg.

It was nice to find a place that Kim and I can both enjoy. It lets her justify eating cupcakes for breakfast and gives me an opportunity to eat dishes that I enjoyed when I lived in Hawaii. Moreover, it has a little bit of everything so you can satisfy a diverse group of people and palettes. The food was very good and we stuffed ourselves. They could work on their service a bit. They have a lot of teenagers working that don't have a lot of service experience - you have to ask for refills or flag them down when you want your check, but the food was awesome, so it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I am a breakfast snob... I've been perfecting my own omelette making skills since I was 11 (I'm now 30) and I enjoy cooking in general... so for me to get out of the house for breakfast, it better be darn good.

That said, I am a regular at BabyCakes Cafe.  The pancakes are far better than I can ever make at home, and they've spoiled me with awesome toppings such as fresh whipped cream (i.e. not that junk from a can)... also not something I would take the time to do at home.

These few negative reviews were clearly written by someone who came once when they were in a bad mood, or for whatever reason had an isolated bad experience.  I have eaten here dozens of times and from that more proper sampling I can say that this place knows how to \"break the fast\" better than anywhere else I have tried in Vegas.

I usually don't care much for taking the time to write reviews (I know, I'm a jerk), but I am taking the time to create a yelp login just so I can review BabyCakes because it's that good... and everyone I bring there loves it."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here and had the best dining experience ever! Our waitress Kayla was so helpful and had that true aloha spirit! She recommended the pancake specials....... Bananas foster and German chocolate cake pancakes ! They were amazing! I will be telling all of my friends about this place! Kayla thank you for all of your suggestions and for making our experience wonderful! Can't wait to go back and try the Kahlua pig benedict !"}
{"text":"Visit here every time we come to Vegas. Fresh, made to order pancakes. Unique flavors, plus some delicious savory selections on the menu. You will wait to be seated at times since it's busy, trust that it's worth the wait. Reasonably priced, delicious, comforting breakfast food."}
{"text":"We wanted to like the place, but unfortunately we will not return.  I'm giving it one star because the waitress was nice and friendly (although once our food was delivered, she seemed to disappear).  Make sure you pay attention to the wait list as they were calling people out of order.  We asked if we could sit at the counter and were told we had to wait, but then a couple walked in a few minutes later and walked straight to the counter where they were served (even after the hostesses talked about how they were not on the list).  I ordered corn beef hash and eggs with seasoned potatoes and buttermilk pancakes.  This is my favorite breakfast, but this one ranks at the bottom of the list.  It appeared and tasted as though the hash came out of a can with some chopped onions thrown in (do not put onions in hash please).  It was very dry even with the over easy eggs mixed in (I ordered over medium). The potatoes were overcooked and flavorless.  Even with syrup poured all over them, the pancakes were extremely dry.  We will stick with New Day Café."}
{"text":"bad service !!!

I was quoted 40-45 min for a table for 4 on a Sunday at 12:24pm. We decided to go 3 miles away and get a smoothie and come back. At 12:50 we checked in and said she called us at 12:39pm... I reminded her what she quoted us and she said \"I said it could be up to 40-45 min\"... She called us 15min after she quoted me 40-45?!? I've worked in several restaurants, it's not that hard to host.

we also started noticing other tables who ordered after us were getting their food before us. and when our food finally started coming out, it would come out in spurts.

food quality was mediocre. I got the Huntington Scramble and it was nothing special. I also had to ask different waiters several times for extra things. 

definitely won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Love how close this is! Fast service thought it does get busy in the morning, your guaranteed to sit fast. Cute cafe style. Lively. Amazing pancakes. Love the signature red velvet. There omelets are my favorite in town right now. Friendly staff and accommodating. There strawberry lemonade is blissful and unique!"}
{"text":"Despite the wait, the food here is amazing! I tried the local favorite, adobo fried rice omelette, and the red velvet pancakes. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Had red velvet pancakes that were exceptional! They were perfect.

I ordered an adobo fried rice omelette that I've gotten many times before that was saltier than anything I've ever tasted in my life. Ever. It's like they dropped the salt shaker in the pan when cooking or the lid to the soy sauce came off or something. It was really that bad. So I had someone else try it and they spit it out.

Sent it back and they said it's supposed to be salty and if they bring out another it will be the same since it's pre-made in advance. Again, I've had it before and it was never like this. Anyone who could shovel that down has defective taste buds.

Anyway, the pancakes were perfect so this deserved a 3 star review for that."}
{"text":"Wow! This place totally blew our minds and exceeded every expectation. The food is unique and you won't be able to get it anywhere else, and the prices are reasonable.

We got the red velvet pancakes, and the fried rice omelette. The omelette was perfect, not too greasy, and the red velvet pancakes were absolutely amazing.

It's a shame this place isn't open later because we would definitely visit after work if we could. Unfortunately, they close at 2 PM. Regardless, it is still five stars"}
{"text":"Stopped by here again for the first time in years. We came around 12:45 and it was PACKED, although we didn't have to wait for a seat. For a very small place it was still nice because you didn't feel too crowded. 

My friend and I ordered two of the Huntington skillets with eggs over easy with regular pancakes and the cinnabun pancakes. Everything was SO tasty and the prices were great!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for breakfast in the Vegas Valley. Friendly, great food and fast service. The specialty pancakes are out of this world and if you don't try some you are missing out. There is usually a wait so get there a little earlier than you want but it is worth the wait!!! Go try it if you haven't! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Extremely overrated. I expected much better due to the yelp reviews and the hype, but the food was mediocre. I ordered the kalua pig Benedict (two of my favorite foods combined sounded amazing) and the red velvet pancakes. The best thing about the pancakes was the whipped cream on top them. The pancakes themselves were really bland with odd tasting chocolate pieces and a decent cream cheese syrup. The concept is great and the price isnt bad but they're definitely not worth ordering again. The eggs Benedict were mediocre as well. I could get more flavorful hollandaise from ihop, which is says a lot. The pork wasnt tasty to me but I've had too much perfectly cooked kalua pork to enjoy anything less than. I thought the fried cabbage was a pretty good accent though.
 I'd try different menu items from this place again when it isn't as busy in hopes that it's reputation isn't pure hype but honestly this place is average at best."}
{"text":"Every time I have family in town, we HAVE TO go to Babystacks! They get super creative with their pancake flavors! In the past we have had, the orange creamsicle, red velvet, maple bacon, nutella, banana cream pie, and carrot cake pancakes. They're all really delicious but SUUUPER sweet. My little family consisting of me, bf, and our 4yr old usually just order a short stack and share between the three of us. They have filipino-esque dishes like adobo fried rice along with hawaiian fusion options like Loco Moco. 

My bf's favorite is their patty melt. It IS delicious but the last time we had it, I think they added an extra helping of grease.... which my bf didn't mind, LOL. 

My favorite USED TO be the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, but recently, their hollandaise has had the consistency of pudding, the color of cheez whiz and the taste of.... idk, NOT hollandaise. Tis a shame because I always ordered it when we went. The last time I ordered their Kalua Pig grilled cheese and although it was delicious, it too, had an extra helping of grease. I couldn't finish the whole thing so I just handed it to the bf.  

Other than the hollandaise, this place is pretty consistent and although I have a hard time picking out stuff to eat (partly bc I'm filipino and can cook a lot of what they offer), we can't help but to keep coming back for their pancakes. The 4yr. old is a definite fan! :D

*Also, they've opened up a second location in Spring Valley (still on Buffalo Dr.) It's still a ways from our place but close enough to have in the back of our minds when weekend brunch approaches!"}
{"text":"Learn how to cook steak!!!! And don't serve half good size steaks and half flat flank carne asada looking steaks!!! Will never get steak and eggs here again."}
{"text":"They have the best banna pancakes by far that I've tasted .

We don't usually come to this location since its on the complete opposite side from us, but since we were close we thought we'd stop by for lunch.

I've never had a problem with baby stacks, it was always considered one of the top choices for lunch.

This location felt a lot like being in a restaurant back home (Hawaii) with all the reggae music playing.  

Our server, who I totally forgot her name was very patient although it was so busy. Being pregnant and all I wanted to order everything on the menu.

Slthough the I'm not the best food tester since I always order the same thing; the loco moco Hawaiian chili style! It's amazing 

My boyfriend tried the breakfast burrito & he says it taste like any other breakfast burrito nothing special so I wouldn't recommend it. 

I'd recommend this place if your looking for a decent, not pricey place to catch a good sit down lunch!"}
{"text":"Small place, but I'd say worth the wait if you feel like eating a big serving.

The food was decent to my taste buds. I cook often and most of the stuff is what I like to make but in my own way. The adobo fried rice tasted like, adobo fried rice. lol I wouldn't order it again but it was definitely good! 

I got a steak or chicken of some sort and i remember it being pretty tasty, not enough to remember so that can tell you something.

Wait was about 30 minutes. I'd go again if there was no wait. It was the only place to grab some grub around the area so we waited!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have been to. I've been to many especially in Hawaii and this one tops a lot of them. The customer service  was great. The food came out quick and didn't have to wait too long. The food was so much! I had the Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice. They gave so much Portuguese sausage! The cookie butter French toast was amazing! I just wish they had a smaller version because it was so much! My boyfriend had the same as me but with cinnamon pancakes instead of cookie butter French toast. The prices were reasonable. 

I highly recommend this place to everyone. My boyfriend and I loved it and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places to eat ! The food is simply amazing . If you are a foodie this is a must try place . I had spam and eggs and orange creme pancakes"}
{"text":"Stay away. Food okay. Service is the  worst 15 minutes to just order. 24 minutes to get a Coke. An hour to get cold food. Never got check or a refill on coke. Had to eat with no drink. I even went up front and asked for a refill. Still no luck. Go somewhere else. When I went to pay I was told to go back to table and wait for check. I told them no I had been there for almost 2 hours. Let me pay or I'm walking out I didn't have any more time to waste"}
{"text":"Devoured the food too quickly, otherwise there would have been pictures..

There's not enough good things to say how great this place is. Friendly service and a familiar, yet unique menu. 

I got Chili Loco Moco w/ garlic rice and wow. I would've never thought to put two of my favorite things together, but what a match made in heaven. The chili is meaty, the rice garlicky, and the eggs runny. It's great loco moco that is elevated by chili and cheese. I got it with a side of their homemade mac salad and that was also amazing. It wasn't over the top heavy on the sauce and was a cool contrast to the chili. 

However, my partner probably got the star dish. The chicken adobo fried rice omelette with hash browns. W-o-w. Great flavor and the egg \"wrap\" really added a silky texture against the rice and chicken. 

Both dishes are very flavorful and a unique take on simple breakfast items. The price is very reasonable and the portions are huge. Definitely have to come back to try their pancakes, they looked amazing but I was lured by the chili loco moco. No regrets, just have to have a return visit. 10/10 would recommend. Service, food, everything is on point here."}
{"text":"This was probably the most successful brunch I've had in the longest time. Despite the heavy crowd, my loved ones were seated within 10 minutes. Our server was attentive to our table and our food did not take long to arrive. Not to mention our drinks were constantly refilled.

So let me talk about that Chili Moco though...there's a reason there's a recommendation icon next to it. It's sooo freaking bomb! My man was surprised I smoothed my plate way before him given that I'm normally the slow eater. I may have been just super hungry that morning and that's why I was so glad I ordered the German Chocolate Babystacks as included in my order. It's chocolate pancake smothered with coconut flakes with drizzles of pecan and caramel AND chocolate syrup. I was in love in an instant! I got to try the red velvet as well. I'd go for that one too.

This second visit here definitely confirmed it for me. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Always crazy busy.  I don't like sitting at a 2 seater table. I like having space to move. Such a spoiled brat am I. Lol last time I was in at this location and at another location I wasn't satisfied with Lolo's Adobo Fried rice omelette. So, I got A Veggie Garden omelette which was good but nothing to rave about. My niece got the cookie butter pancakes. Mmmmmm..... Move over red velvet, cookie butter is in the house! That was good! Next time, I'm doing just cookie butter pancakes.

Mediocre."}
{"text":"It's awesome!  Came here 2x and it was great both times.  Cute little mom & pop shop.  Adobo fried rice, kalua benedicts, and red velvet pancakes are delish! Both servers were good and took care of us and not overwhelming.  Both times we came here about 8am and not busy at all but when were were about to leave people started trickling in.  Well definetly be back. I want to try something else but I know I'll end up stick with either the 3 I've tried."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice was ok, not like my parents', I like more flavor.  It came with a side of your choice, hash brown, Mac salad, or pancakes. I chose the mac salad which was just ok. 

The hubs got the sausage links, egg and hash brown breakfast with a side of red velvet pancakes (2 cakes). 

For what we ordered it was perfect. We shared the pancakes which ended or meal as our dessert. 

Service was good, and it wasn't crazy busy at 9:30am. 

For the 2 of us , the bill was $21+.

Well be back.  I'll try something else.... Maybe the cookies and cream or banana foster pancakes. 1 stack I think would be best. 

Until next time *waving"}
{"text":"Locals-type diner for some Hawaiian fare, but mostly for pancakes that are a bit on the sweet side.  To be quite honest, IHOP fare might be comparable.

People really like Babystacks, though.  Business seems good here.  The room was full.

The Red Velvet short stack was comprised of three extremely red pancakes.  Rather heavy-handed in the food colouring, even for RV.  Cream cheese syrup goes very nicely with them.  The combo tastes exactly like a Red Velvet Cake.

It was pretty good, light and fluffy... if a bit on the dry side for a pancake.  I prefer hotcakes with more butter or moisture in them.  Babystacks offers interesting variety of pancake flavours, including Carrot Cake.

Loco Moco was tasty.  Poached eggs, cooked medium, were still runny enough over the meat patty and scoops of rice.

Portions could be bigger.  Prices are low.  Service was alright.  Restroom was clean.

I really wanted to like Babystacks a lot more, but it was just okay.

Maybe stop in if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip."}
{"text":"Their parking is plenty located within a large shopping center. Their prices are friendly from $3.00-$18.00. The vibe is always packed with many locals. The service was busy, but yet somehow the servers always came to check on our table at the right time. The food selections are wonderful. Many include breakfast plates. Their portions are huge! If your hungry get the Mexican food plate with tortillas which comes with chicken, rice and beans. I came hungry, but after leaving not only was I happy with the service, price and food, but I was full! My portion was more than tasty enough food. Enough to feed two! I recommend next time you want some good tasty breakfast, but not from a big food chain eatery come to this place it's excellent! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Normally it's packed as hell (30-40 minute wait), but I got lucky on a Monday around 11ish.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  A great wide selection of pancake flavors...from Rocky road to their signature Red Velvet (a definite must try!)  I ordered their Kalua Pig Benedict --omg it's so damn good.  The best Hawaiian fusion breakfast.  The eggs were cooked perfect and the kalua pig was flavored perfectly (not crazy salty).  I also ordered a side of Red Velvet short stacks.  MmMmMm...came with a fluffy dollop of whipped butter and side of melted cream cheese icing and sprinkled with chocolate chips crumbles.  I'm normally not a sweets kinda person when it comes to breakfast, but this was absolutely delicious.  It paired well with the Kalua Pig Benedicts.  The only thing I regret is not taking a picture before devouring the whole thing.   I will definitely be back to this cute little cafe!"}
{"text":"The service was speedy, friendly, and they gave me everything I asked for without missing a beat. The pancakes are phenomenal! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The first time I came to BabyStacks, I was seated immediately and had an attentive server. I took in the ambiance--soothing music that suited the mood, wooden tables and chairs, TVs in good positions, and overall, it was a comfortable setting. The wait for my food was never too long either. These factors also held true the second time around. Now, here's what I've got to say about the food:

- Red Velvet Pancakes: Now this, this is what a lot of people like to come for, so I had to try it. It really is a delicious stack. The ratio of whipped cream, to pancake, to cream cheese syrup is the key to the perfect bite of this dish! I do have a comment on it's consistency though. I prefer pancakes that are fluffy and melt in your mouth. These pancakes have a little bit of a chew to it but not enough to be drastically inedible. In fact, my peers didn't even notice. Otherwise, this alone is a great reason to come to BabyStacks!
- Adobo Fried Rice: I love it and I couldn't stop eating it. It is flavorful and some might say it's a little salty, but that's just how I like it!
- Country Fried Steak and Eggs: Nothing special, but still very tasty!

BabyStacks is a great place to eat and definitely offers a lot of variety. Bring everyone with you!"}
{"text":"Love the Garlic rice it is delicious!!! Suggest the Cinnamon pancakes yummy!!   Breakfast with Granddaughter..came at 10 had a bit of a wait but once we sat down Gidget our server was top notch!   Lovely time at a very sweet restaurant!   I love being able to have rice with breakfast!   It's like having a bit of Hawaii in he morning!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me.  My wife had the orange creamcicle pancakes and I had the country fried steak.  The pancakes did not live up to standard they were dry and overcooked.  My fried steak was ok.  I would rather go to Mr Mama's."}
{"text":"I am not sure how I heard of this place but I am so glad that we were able to enjoy breakfast here.  My wife ordered pancakes with bacon and I ordered a Mexican omelette with a side of the orange creamsicle pancakes.  I had thought the pancakes were going to be super sweet but these orange creamsicle pancakes were really good. They are served with an orange icing to top the pancakes and the whole meal was enjoyable.  I would effeminately visit this place again since they have a wide selection of dishes."}
{"text":"I come here every single time I'm in vegas and I'm never disappointed. Everything is delicious and decently priced. The seasoned potatoes are SOOO good, no other place compares. I always get the spam scramble and the cookie butter French toast. The French toast is delicious and the spam scramble is filling. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast and lunch! The kalua grilled cheese is mouth watering."}
{"text":"Stopped in @ 7 am Sat. morning. If you arrive @ 7:15 get ready to wait. I got right in & had bacon & eggs. Very good breakfast & good coffee & service."}
{"text":"Pancakes were really good. Eggs Benedict were great. My girlfriend had the Loco Moco and it was delicious. Unfortunately I can't give this place more stars because the service was terrible. 

Waited 15 minutes to seat two while there were three empty tables clean and ready. No one was attentive. Had to wait a good while to order too. 

Bottom line - if you're in the area and have time to wait, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing the service was off... Maybe we went on a rough dayd I would make it a point to try this place again! The have a lot of SPAM on the menu and I would like to try it in a Hawaiian dish!!"}
{"text":"This. Was. So. Good. Honestly. I had the veggie omelette which comes with potatoes AND pancakes. It was the perfect size. Big but not overwhelming. I upgraded to the s'mores babystacks and oh my goodness. Heaven incarnated onto a plate. My best friend got peanut butter and banana ones and also was in love. 

Our server was amazing. like I said, food was incredible. I think it's my favorite restaurant now. I love a good cheap, hearty, homey breakfast place. There were like five parties in front of us for a wait but they got through them so quickly! 

Only thing is I wish they had espresso drinks: lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, etc. or even iced coffee! The bottomless refillable coffee is nice though, so I can't complain about that. Overall, great, delicious time."}
{"text":"Arrived 10:40am. Seated right away, drink order taken. OJ for me coffee for gf. 

Few minutes to look over menu, I decided on  Portuguese sausage and eggs w/red velvet pancakes. My gf had the Piglet omelette. Less than a 10 minute wait for our food, talk about quick service. Everything was good as always."}
{"text":"Excellent service along with excellent food!! The kalua pig grilled cheese was awesome. Loaded with moist and flavorful kalua pig! Comes with your choice of side. I had the potatoes. 

My gf had the piglet omelet which she loved. Loaded with ham, bacon and sausage. She had a side of pancakes."}
{"text":"I love this cafe and I am so glad it is around the corner. I called in my order for pick up and it was ready on time. It stayed hot and fresh until I got home and we pigged out. My husband had the veggie garden omelet with potatoes and I had a short stack of German chocolate pancakes which was so good! My other favorites are the red velvet pancakes, cookie butter French toast, and garlic rice. Will be back again to try the hazel nut pancakes and the adobo fried rice dish."}
{"text":"We've tried :

Loco Moco
Rick's Adobo Fried Rice
Baby Chick Omelette
Ranchero Omelette
Breakfast Burrito

If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian breakfast, look no further than the loco moco and Rick's adobo fried rice at Babystacks Cafe. The loco moco, served with garlic rice, was oozing with deliciousness and had a brown gravy that was tough to beat. The fried rice was massive in size, only to be matched in flavor. 

The intimate setting inside makes you feel like you've left Las Vegas and have entered a little Hawaiian eatery. I will definitely be back.

Aloha!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the beloved Babycakes? How about... they play an excellent selection of music to complement the delicious meal experience.

Sometimes... check that... frequently, hype overshadows the actual product. Thankfully, this was not the case with Babycakes. For all the praise showered upon the Red Velvet Pancakes, they still uber-deliciously and surprisingly exceeded my expectations. They are easily the best pancakes I've ever had. Red Velvet Pancakes with the Cream Cheese that they provide » regular pancakes with maple syrup.

We also ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict, and Nutella Crepes. I like how the fried rice is wrapped in an egg to make it sort of like an omelet. My cousin, Sarah N, commented that the egg was bland, but I think it works well with the saltiness of the Adobo. The Kalua Pig Benedict was also yummy. I do love a good [insert food adjective here] Benedict and this one works for me. Finally, the Nutella Crepes totally hit the spot to end our meal. Strangely enough, I'm more of a savory crepe person but this one also works for me.

I wish they weren't so far from home. Or maybe it's a good thing they're not near my house.

5 stars"}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service, and a variety of unique breakfast dishes make Babystacks one of my favorite hidden gems in Las Vegas. Try their scrambles with a side of pancakes!"}
{"text":"This is a small breakfast place but with very good food! They are open from 7-2pm during the week and 7-3 on weekends. We ordered the pork skillet which was delicious. It had a lot of cheese however, it could have been better with some peppers or onion. We also ordered the traditional eggs Benedict which was average. Baby Stacks is well known for their red velvet pancakes which are phenomenal! This is a must try! 
Overall the place has pretty good food. The bad part is that there is always a long wait and they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST OF LIFE! 
I'm not a breakfast person, but I'm a sweets person and this place has the best pancakes in the world. I could eat them every day! Wish I had one where I live (Az) but it's nice to put on my must go to list when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Average tasting food. My husband's pancakes were tough. And service so slow to the point where one of the patrons got up to ask about their food order. There seemed to be enough staff, the tables weren't filled so I'm not sure why the service was slow. With that said, the service staff was courteous and apologized appropriately."}
{"text":"I have gone to Babystacks often and I enjoyed the food and the service.  Today I went with several family members from out of town.  I bragged about the service and the food to them.  All four of us ordered our food.  Two people sat next to us at the counter and ordered their food after us.  Every one in my party except me was served their food as well as the people next to us.  I waited several minutes and our server did not come by, everyone was enjoying their food and I had to flagged down the server to ask about my simple order of french toast.  She quickly told me they forgot my order and I asked her to cancel it, she walked away and NEVER returned to us.  Then she sent another server over to ask me if I was sure I wanted to cancel the order and I told her, yes I want to cancel my order.  She proceeded to tell me, they forgot the order and when I asked how they forgot but remembered everyone else's I was told that french toast takes a while to cook, mind you the lady next to me ordered steak and eggs and still got her food in timely fashion.  Then she said to me like she was doing me a favor that she would take it off my bill.  I was truly upset at the extremely poor service and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stick with the pancakes, adobo fried rice, country fried steak and loco moco when eating here..

Stay away from the omelettes and benedicts. I think they were just an afterthought. Like, \"hey, let's put some omelettes and benedicts on our menu to widen our clientele!\" 

So stick with the pancakes."}
{"text":"I'm super plain Jane when it comes to pancakes BUT the red velvet pancakes are absolutely amazing. They made it work. Service is also great. Phone died so no pic or check in yet.....but I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 92/100

Props to the owner for including creative Filipino touches to the menu. The chicken adobo fried rice and garlic rice option for breakfast specials (Sinangag in Filipino) made me and my galpal feel right at home! 

I honestly can't believe we waited this long before hitting Babystacks. It's an all-rounder, service and food were both wins! And even better, the lines weren't hauntingly tedious like we dreaded them to be. Took us less than 5 minutes to be seated but don't buy our case as fact. I have a feeling that certain days will be busier than others, seeing as people come in families, not just in pairs/singles. 

Due to unavailable table seating (yep, they had to re-arrange tables to accommodate parties of 4-6), we were led to the bar where we tuned in to the morning news. I don't remember us waiting long before we ordered. We were pretty ready to rock & roll and devour! Servings are pretty decent (I'd say large for us, Asians) and we shared the Corned Beef Hash with Sunny Side up Eggs, wheat bread and the savory, buttery Garlic Rice, also known as Sinangag in Filipino. 

On top of that, we figured it would be a waste to not try one of their specialty pancakes. As Hazlenut/Nutella lovers, we debated whether to get the Hazlenut pancakes or the more well-known Red Velvet stack. We ended up with the former and beamed as they got to our counter drizzled with nutella, crushed almonds and whipped cream. Holy moly, were they pretty - and I don't know if you could use this word for pancakes - chunky! A whole spoonful would take a while to chew on and swallow without the help of a drink. Milk did the magic. Soon enough, we had to stop before the they filled us up to our throats. 

Babystacks impressed me, especially since one would not decipher the cultural fusion that occurs until you get a glance at the menu!"}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast place that has a humongous menu with reasonable prices too. You can upgrade you omelette side of pancakes to one of their fancy pancakes. I've tried the red velvet and the cinnamon roll pancakes and they are AMAZING. Expect to wait for a table on the weekends, but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Bananas Foster Pancakes! These are my absolute favorite pancakes ever! Honestly, all of their pancakes are great, all of their food is great. I usually go for the Piglet Skillet add Carnitas, gotta get all the pork!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, both locations are amazing. The spot off of Smoke Ranch and Buffalo is a little smaller than the one on Flamingo and Buffalo but the food is absolutely the same. I love this take on Hawaiin and Breakfast Food, definitely something different and the pancake variety is crazy good. I personally do not care for pancakes but here, they are irresistable, super moist and fluffy and pretty much any topping you could wish for. One of my favorite dishes tho is the spam omellete, omg... I really don't understand what spam is, nor do I want to, but fried... it is one of the most amazing meats(?) ever!! I love the little sesame & seawood stuff they sprinkle on the rice, what a unique breakfast. The prices aren't too bad either, for the food, I think its worth it, something off the strip and outside of the box."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband and siblings and Amanda was GREAT. it was our first time here so it took awhile to look over the menu to decide on our meal and Amanda was great giving us time  giving us suggestions, and then checking how we enjoyed the food.

Food was DELICIOUS. We had Lolo Rick's Adobe fried rice, country fried steak (not so starchy as other places I've been too), chili moco, and a loco moco. We shared a nutella crepe which was not overwhelming and just enough nutella. Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"It was just okay , nothing to write home about. I have had better at other breakfast places."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice & red velvet pancakes never fail! Delicious. And server Jason was very nice."}
{"text":"Great place for a traditional American style and/or Filipino Style breakfast. The wait was reasonable. I recommend the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Went there   today for the first time. I had the spinach Benedict. It was good! Service was good and prompt. Teamwork observed. Seating could be more comfy. Booths, or a little more private. Tables seem pretty close together. But overall; it was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Love the Hawaiian breakfast items here, so tasty!  Kalua pig very high quality.  Those are really the best reason to come here.  The coffee is very strong and slightly bitter.  Portions are quite large.  Pancakes were just okay, not that fluffy but I like all the different flavors they offer.  Not too sugary like some other places in town.  Prices are okay overall, all the upgrades they offer can add up if you're not careful.

Friendly waiters working very hard, could have used more people working today.  Everything was a bit of a wait, but they were busting their butts.  Pretty good on drink refills.

We were seated right under a ceiling fan today, will have to watch out for that next time because it was too cold, and made my food cold very fast.  I think one of the tables next to us asked them to crank it up to high :( because it wasn't like that at first."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint, but unremarkable.  Didn't have to wait for a table, but the service was slightly slow, they seemed understaffed.  I got a skillet, husband got a benedict, neither one of us got pancakes since we try to eat low-carb these days.  The portion size was just adequate for me, husband left hungry.  I felt like the plating was designed to hide how little meat was on your plate.  The coffee was not bad, but I noticed they are quicker to refill at first than later, they pretty clearly were trying to get people to finish eating and leave quickly.  Even though there were empty tables around as we were eating, and nowhere near closing time.  That, along with the spartan, crammed-in atmosphere, tacky signs, and lack of warmth, is a bit off-putting.  I would probably come here again, since the food wasn't bad, but there are so many decent cheap breakfast places around the neighborhood that I might never bother.  Rather eat somewhere less stingy."}
{"text":"Went here looking for a different look on a breakfast a while back and found it to be pretty overpriced for a pancake place. Service was so so.  And the place kinda had a funny smell like maybe the complex or strip mall there was having issues . Omlete house is always a good choice is you are bummed on your experience here ."}
{"text":"I wish I had known that Sunday's are super busy. Nonetheless, it was more than adequate for a breakfast date. 

I ordered the Mexican omelette, minus the carnitas, which you can do if you don't eat meat or don't like an ingredient in their put together omelettes. My bf ordered the breakfast burrito, once again without the meat. The Mexican omelette was a 7/10, which is pretty decent on my scale. I'm the spicy type of person, and so I had to soak my eggs in Valentino (which they provide, yippee!). The Bf definitely enjoyed his breakfast burrito, which came with a side of potatoes as well (seasoned or hashbrowns)...but I think he liked the Mexican omelette more too!  

The omelet also comes with a side of potatoes and 2 babystacks, so it's like getting a WHOLE meal and more. 

I'll be back ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I like to order the Hawaiian Benedict. The gravy is so good! I go only during the week as it's a VERY popular place on the weekends. My family has enjoyed many wonderful meals here!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star is the service. I felt a little rushed both times I went. The servers were nice but just that. Not the best at offering up suggestions when I said it was my first time and knew nothing about the place or menu. That aside the food was amazing!!! The first time I went I got the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage - holy yum!!!!! So much flavor and stuffed perfectly. The next time I had to bring my fiancé and he got the loco moco - for not being in Hawaii... WOW! I mean I'm not an islander myself but I've been to Hawaii and this definitely compares! I got the short stack of the Bananas Foster and it was perfect! Next time I'll ask for the sauce on the side because it was soooo sweet but what do I expect? It's Bananas Foster caramel sauce; which was totally on point! Not to mention the taste of the pancakes themselves, buttermilk perfection! I'd probably enjoy them on their own with a dash of syrup! Can't wait to try more - their pancake flavors are endless!"}
{"text":"it was pretty good... Small on the inside. good food their orange juice is fresh with slight pulp... love their seasoned potatoes"}
{"text":"I implore you, please eat here and be blessed. You will thank me, and then want to go back tomorrow. 

Baby stacks is an awesome Hawaiian breakfast and lunch joint with a unique flair. Their pancakes are some of the best I've had, and come in a wide variety of flavors. Their Kahlua pork eggs Benedict is my favorite thing on the menu. I literally dream about that dish with a short stack of red velvet pancakes. I tried this place for the first time in August of 2014 and went back 6 times in the next 5 weeks. 

Just go."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  

My husband, sister and her boyfriend had breakfast here on the weekend that my husband and I were going to get married.  We had a sampler of pancakes to share and some other savory dishes to share.  

The items that we talked about after leaving here were the red velvet pancakes, rocky road pancakes, but the real headlining event was Rick's adobo fried rice.

Now a breakfast place to look forward to when going to Vegas."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm good!  Period! This is a locals place and way off the strip, but delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing it's a MUST everytime we come to vegas. A few miles off the strip but worth it. I highly recommend this place when your in town."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you're looking for pancakes. I was craving them one day so I went on yelp and sure enough BabyStacks popped up. When we went in, the room was spacious and not too crowded. (Guess we came at a good time) Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. My friend ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet. He loved it and said it was better than most places he's had it from. Along with that he also got the Cookies N Creme pancakes for a side. He really enjoyed them, as did I! I had the Cinnamon Roll pancakes and those were delicious, but I think I preferred the Cookies N Creme. Either way, both were great! Glad to know they have a Henderson location! (:"}
{"text":"Always a good breakfast at baby stacks. The pancakes are awesome. We have eaten there a few times and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of the reasons I really like this place is because of their pancakes and they let you order a side of pancakes with omelette or eggs with hashbrowns or what have you. I wouldn't suggest their steak it kinda looks like rubbery. I also think it's a bit small for the traffic they get."}
{"text":"We can here two days in a row and will always come back any time I am in Vegas. The service is impeccable and the food is amazing. The pancakes are so moist and full of flavor. 

If you get savory and sweet,  eat the savory first because you won't want to eat anything but the pancakes. 

They also got be a huge to go cup of coffee for my road trip. Great food and great service. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were deciding between this Babystacks and the one near the strip, and we're so glad we chose this location! The wait was 30 minutes shorter than the franchise near the strip. 

By waiter suggestion, we ordered the adobo omelet upgraded with garlic rice (the most popular order) and a short stack of strawberry pancakes. Everything was delicious!! If you're looking a hearty, comforting Hawaiian-fusion-brunch, try Babystacks!!"}
{"text":"Typically a longer wait but a small place with crazy good food. A must go to breakfast place. Everytime I go I say I'll try something else but I always end up getting the creme cheese crepes which are amazing and filling."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast many times and Babystacks never disappoints. I've only been to this location and the one at S. Buffalo, but at both restaurants, the service has always been fabulous despite the crowds at peak breakfast times. A fan favorite, as well as my own, is the red velvet pancakes which are rich and indulgent, but totally amazing. I also love their seasoned potatoes! My parents like to try new things off the menu every time we go and they've never been dissatisfied. I definitely recommend Babystacks but if you're going to come, come early! This place fills up completely by 8am on most mornings it seems, weekday or weekend."}
{"text":"very yummy.

i liked the adobo chicken rice wrapped in egg thing.  it was nice flavor.  the macaroni salad was very comforting.  

the carrot cake pancakes were yummy

i tried ger-ger's pork benedict.  very good.

nice fusion filipino / american breakfast food.

very nice server."}
{"text":"Coming from someone who enjoys going to brunch every now and then, this place was aightttttt. The location is great from my home, literally down the street. Variety wise on the menu, they got it down. I was expecting a bit more because the hype was so built up. Now being able to experience it for myself, I was satisfied but not to the point where i wanted to finish my food. 

I ordered the Piglet Skillet. If you want unseasoned over fried potatoes and barely any cheese and overdone scrambled eggs; I definitely recommend this dish. It was really dry, like something they just threw together on the grill without any seasonings. 

My parents ordered the Senior breakfast both exactly the same except one with scrambled eggs and the other with over easy eggs. Our waiter failed to comprehend that. He thoughtfully replaces the eggs and let us keep the old eggs. Over all the food was okay, just wish it wasn't bland. Oh and mind you, we asked for condiments including salt and pepper and he failed to bring the salt and pepper. 

 Our waiter, he was nice at first. Greeted us once we sat down but after he brought us our order of drinks, it began going downhill from there. He checked up on us once throwout our whole 45 minutes there. I had to signal him down for him to come to our table. It's funny cause he would look our way but not make his way. 

Would I go back here to eat again? Sure, if everything else was crowded I definitely would. Please season your potatoes at least."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I had the Loco Moco and it was delicious!! I have been several times and everything I have tried has been great! Staff is always friendly :) Only thing is, if you go on the weekends the wait is long but that also shows how good the place is."}
{"text":"Best place near here for brunch!  Adobo fried rice omelette, Kaluah pork grilled cheese sandwich, & red velvet pancakes!!!  Everything tastes delicious!!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but amazing things to say about the hostess at this location. Cassie was extremely welcoming upon entering the facility. She was so helpful in seating us and was so easy to talk to. She even explained the menu's to my husband and I as it was our first time there. Upon our second visit, she was exactly the same! Such a sweet person who enjoys what she does :)"}
{"text":"We were put in such bad seating. & there were many empty tables .. we asked the host if there was another table & he didn't move us. We were a couple steps away from the bathroom. Like I mean TWO STEPS. it made me lose my appetite. & on top of that, we waited for 25 minutes for our food to come out. I used to go to baby stacks a lot & I remember it tasting MUCH better than this !
I ordered Loco Moco with garlic rice, that was okay. Then my boyfriend got adobo fried rice omelet & it didn't taste like anything. It was so bland!!! The thing that got me is the Portuguese sausage .. it was definitely not Portuguese sausage. It tasted like the Hillshire sausage from smiths. What a waste of money. Never coming back to any Babystacks again .."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon around 2pm - an hr before they close. We got hazelnut pancakes and the special fried rice. The fried rice was good but not the best I ever had so it was just okay, nothing super special that I would come back for. The potatoes was actually pretty good - well cooked and well seasoned. The hazelnut pancakes were nice and fluffy and not too sweet which I really appreciate since most places tend to dump a whole jar of sugar in their pancakes. I think it went very well with the wiped cream on top with no additional syrup.

Overall
Taste 3/5
Serice 4/5 very friendly
Price: 4/5 reasonable and worth it
Parking: 4/5 plenty in the lot"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat breakfast in town!!! I recommend it to my friends all the time! Red Velvet pancakes are perfection every time and I don't usually like sweets in the am but these are the exception! Also love the Huntington skillet with avocado yum as well as the Portuguese sausage which is a little spicy but yummy! Can never go wrong with spam and eggs either lots of favorites you should go!!! The only reason I give 4 Stars and not 5 is because this location has terrible air flow in the summer I don't like to Go to the flamingo location! Beside all that the food is always on point...you may have a long wait on weekends and also they won't seat incomplete parties so make sure everyone's on time!!!"}
{"text":"Great red velvet pancakes! This is the reason you go here!!
If you haven't tried these pancakes you haven't tried what Babystacks
is all about.

Banana cream pancakes are also a delicious option that come in to a close second place."}
{"text":"Came in with my mom around 8:30 on a Sunday morning. I'm so glad it wasn't busy because every time I come here (probs around after 10) there's always a line. It's also usually a 30 min wait. 

Since we came so early, we were seated right away. Carlos was our server. He was very nice and polite. I ordered the corn beef hash with garlic rice, over medium eggs, and red velvet pancakes with no whip cream. My mom had the senior breakfast. Our order came out promptly. The corn beef hash was crispy on top and the over medium eggs were perfectly cooked! I couldn't finish that because I wanted my pancakes lol. The red velvet pancakes were fluffy and the perfect amount of sweetness! I also couldn't finish that cos I was pretty full. So they have pretty decent portions. 

Our server made sure we had the condiments we needed and always refilled our drinks! Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Have heard about the Red velvet pancakes..gave them a try. Big let down. Pancake was very dry, even after syrup. Was only able to have a couple bites."}
{"text":"Was it insanity or a senior moment?  I have made the same mistake in the past when we stayed at the South Point, but I thought the restaurant would be reasonably close to Sam's.  It wasn't so don't do it.  This location and its S. Buffalo counterpart are always busy for breakfast, but we lucked out and did not have to wait for a table though a waiting line formed shortly thereafter.  My wife ordered the banana cream pie pancakes, I ordered crepe-like lemon ricotta. Even after drizzling the pancakes with 2 containers of cream cheese syrup and lemon segments, mine were virtually tasteless.  Hers was delicious, mine was not.  She finished hers, I did not.  She was very happy, I was not."}
{"text":"We made the long drive to the original location because that address was listed on our KSHP gift certificate.  On arrival the hostess told us there would a 30-40 minute wait and advised us to go to their new location where our certificate would be honored.  After about a 15 minute drive and 5-10 minutes wait, we ordered short stacks of the banana cream pie pancakes that I so enjoyed on our last trip.  The batter must have been too thick because our pancakes were noticeably thicker and drier. A big disappointment."}
{"text":"Baby Stacks Café will be our breakfast stop on our trips out to Las Vegas from now on.  We ended up going twice on this trip and I had the HM1 in both the omlette and skillet style.  Service is great, fast and the food has never let me down!!!  You will never go wrong coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Vangeie Salonga/owner....A little girl trying to make mature business decisions..Grade \"F\" 
Sunday was our 4th and final attempt to eat at this so called great place. We arrived at 9:30; was told the wait would be 1 1/2 hrs to 1 hour and 45 minutes. As crazy as it sounds we decided to wait but left the premises and was back within an hour thinking we would have at least another 30 minutes before we would be seated. We gave our name and asked how much longer the wait would be, only to find they had called our name within 30 minutes and not 1 1/2 hour as they had told us. I think the girl at the counter felt bad and said \"let me see if I can seat you now.\" (obviously there was a table available) She asked an Asian girl who I later found out is one of the owners daughters. She said no; we would have to wait another 30 to 45 minutes now. I explained; this was our 4th attempt to eat here and was told the wait would be much longer than what it was, are you so busy you can't accommodate 2 people? The Asian girls answer was \"yes we are.\" I then asked for a manager and Vangeie (Asian girl) informed me it is a family owned business and she and her sister are the managers and there was no one Else to talk to. I told her I would be writing a review and asked Vengeie for her last name (Salonga); she then told me \"Oh and by the way my sisters name is Liberty.\" It is pathetic when you think you can be so cocky and disrespectful as the owner to think your business is invincible. Vangeie; I have been a business owner for 25 years and you need to learn about customer service if you want to stay in business. You might be so busy now you can send people away without a care, but restaurants come and go in this town and with your attitude and lack of customer service as the owner don't count on being around long. This is a small town and word gets out. Remember if one person has a bad experience they will tell 10 other people....make that 20. How stupid you are not knowing business 101.....customer service."}
{"text":"Good food ok service try the bacon pancakes.  Good place to go Sunday morning.  Didn't like their coffee and they don't like short and to the point reviews"}
{"text":"When I wrote my last review based on a previous experience, it was actually intended for their Summerlin location (2400 N Buffalo Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89128). I didn't realize at the time that there was another location or that the street address was the same. Anyway, I visited this location on 04/13/2013 and it was just as great as my previous experience!

Between three of us, we ordered the BANANA CREAM PIE PANCAKES (Bananas in buttermilk batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, sliced bananas, drizzled banana cream sauce, and topped with crushed pie crust and almonds), SPAM AND EGGS BREAKFAST WITH GARLIC RICE, KALUA PIG BENEDICT (toasted English muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke-flavored pork, then topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce) with seasoned potatoes, and MEXICAN OMELETTE (marinated carnitas, sliced jalapeños, fresh pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream) with hash brown.

Everything was soooo yummy! And I LOVE finding places that make me feel like I'm back home (in Hawaii) eating breakfast at my favorite local spot! Very well done. I love the ingenuity and execution of the different exquisite pancakes as well. I can't wait to try another flavor!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype with this places at all.firstly it reminds me of eating in a high school gym at lunch time during the busiest hours.the owners have have spent very little on decorating the place just put some cheap wooden benches down,and said \"we are a Restarant,I thought the pancakes were just ok lacked
Fluffiness and father small

My wife's gash browns were way over cooked and her eggs where cooked over easy not over medium
NOPE won't be back however try it for urself but it didn't WOW me at all..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Stumbled across it on Yelp and thought that the reviews were so good we couldn't pass it up.  Everyone was raving about the red velvet pancakes, and they were right!  They are incredible.  I also got portugese sausage, eggs, and garlic rice, and all of it was wonderful (except the eggs were not quite as firm as a like.)  My boyfriend got the adobo omelet and it was really good too.  The wait is long but worth it - I'll definitely be back.  I'm already dying to try both the Smores pancakes and the Macadamia / white chocolate pancakes."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! The banana cream pancakes are stuff dreams are made of :) gets really busy on the weekend & service can be slow at times. We've eaten here more than 4 times & each time the food was good but service varied. Give it a try but be patient - depending on the day! Go early for quick seating!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. The service was a little slow but I was not in a hurry. Only problem they were out of my favorite pancake. I have been to Babystacks at other locations and they have all been very good."}
{"text":"Erik was our server, had the tiramisu pancakes it was amazing and extremely fluffy. Chicken salad was fresh and chicken was cruchy and the ranch dressing is made in house. It was our first time coming here and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Danielle Danielle Danielle!! OMG, it has been years since I came into a restaurant and had service like my wife and I got from Danielle. We're vacationing up from SoCal, staying over at the Marriott  and just picked this place to drop by.  Food was a great value - tasted great, came pretty darn fast, but seriously, if I lived here I'd be in there every week just to go in and have a waitress like Danielle bring me my food. If you're a waitress and you're in the service industry,  you wonder why you don't get tips or you wonder why your tits aren't big enough, come on by here and take a look at how it's done!  just unbelievable! Whoever is running the place,  I hope you're paying her enough because this gal is not going to be here forever!! What a gem!!"}
{"text":"Hanging out with my family for a brunch,
It is a great place to spend time together, I enjoyed my breakfast burrito! Also they enjoyed their Baby Chick Skillet, the Mexican Skillet & the Strawberry Pancake. Price is okay!"}
{"text":"You will not regret dining at BabyStacks Cafe. The service was fantastic and the menu is unbelievable. The variety of pancakes will keep you coming back for more. I tried the carrot cake as an upgraded side and was very happy with it. My imports and hash browns were cooked to perfection. I'll definitely be stopping again on my next, and probably every, trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"As usual..food was good, but service way too s l o w....
Server did as good as be could..had WAY TOO MANY TABLES.
Why is it businesses want our $$$..
boy they are TOO GREEDY to provide enough help to get us back ?"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  Walked in and was seated at the counter for a party of one.  I tried the house favorite \"Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice\" with small stack of pancakes and a side of corned beef hash browns.  The food plates came out with enough food for two people. I had to take half of it home for another meal!  The house special was just ok, but I will be back to try something else.  Service was efficient and quick."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast spot. They need to expand. Plan to wait for a table. Great recipes for pancakes, awesome loco moco, and even better huevos rancheros"}
{"text":"I love BabyStacks!  Apparently so does everyone else because there is always a waiting list - no matter what time or day of the week we have gone.  I actually prefer to go alone because it's easier to get a chair at the bar type area than wait for a table.  

I will say though that the times I have gone with a group, more specifically - my daughter in a wheelchair - the service was great.  I am so appreciative of their wanting to ensure her comfort level & actually acknowledging her existence vs. giving strange looks & talking to me about her in front of her (happens at other restaurants all the time).  The servers are wonderful. Seriously.

As for the food - oh.em.gee.  I have sampled almost every pancake flavor they have & I can't think of a single negative thing to say.  The friends & family I have taken with me who have tried other dishes were just as satisfied by what they had.  

The prices are great, the food is amazing, the service is great...the wait sucks but hey, at least they're busy enough to stay open so I can keep going back!

If there was any suggestion I could give - it's to find a way to have a shaded area outside the building where people can sit/stand while they wait for a table.  The accessibility of the restaurant is often compromised because of the people standing around blocking several areas."}
{"text":"Nice people and good service however food is disgusting and prices are a little high for the portion sizes. I got the biscuits and gravy which tasted like chicken pot pie. The eggs had zero flavor and the potatoes were average. I don't see myself coming here at all in the near future it was sure a disappointment"}
{"text":"Baby stacks is my go to when I think about breakfast out. Apparently a lot of others feel that way too, and who can blame them? Get there before 8 if you don't want to wait for a table. 
By the name you would guess that they specialize in pancakes and you would be right. They have at least 12 varieties and usually a special flavor of the day.
I can only speak to the pancake combo breakfast but it is fantastic. Way better than pancakes at home or anywhere else. The eggs are always cooked perfectly to my liking and their turkey bacon is tasty. Service is quick and friendly. Great spot for great pancakes!"}
{"text":"Food - 4 star average 
Chicken adobo fried rice is like an omelette with rice inside. Srircha makes it taste amazing. - 4 stars.
The loco moco was more like a 2 star dish for me. The meat tasted old, like it had a stink to it, like dirty fridge stink. The meat was also pretty pink on the inside. Not bleeding red, but I don't really like my ground beef on the medium rare side. It definitely set me off and I had to force myself to finish what I had. My brother ordered the same thing, but he said his tasted fine, if not great. He loved it actually. 
The house potatoes were DELICIOUS! - 5 stars! 
The buttermilk pancakes were buttery and fluffy. Definitely will order again. - 5 stars
And last but not least... The red velvet pancakes - 5 stars. I've been dreaming of it since... 


Service - 2 stars. 
The service here was lackluster. We (party of 9) came the day after Christmas and boy did we come at the wrong time. They weren't necessarily busy, but we did have to wait a bit. A party of about 20 went in just before us and it was a HORRIBLE idea to stay after that. The host said he'd separate us, which we didn't mind because we already waited about 30 minutes and our party sat on opposite sides of the restaurant, again no problem. But here's the kicker. The party of 20 that came in before us wiped out the kitchen service as there were only TWO cooks that day. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and by the time the food came, everyone was extremely upset. Our server DID notify us 25 minutes into the wait that they were short on staff in the kitchen. But he never checked on us before or after that notification. We should've left after that, but since we saw the food coming out for the party of 20, we waited. Still, we waited a LONG time after. No compensation made for being there for almost 3 hours. 3 precious day after shopping hours. 

TIP: EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE THERE IN ORDER TO BE SEATED."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are to die for. 
My son ordered them and they were incredible
I ordered the Benedict and a Nutella crepe
The crepe was really soft I didn't like it

The service was great though
Only 3 stars because the foul stench in the woman's restroom 
Sewage
It was awful"}
{"text":"Wow! So glad I found this place on yelp! I got seated quickly despite what other reviews said about wait time. All the reviews raved about the red velvet pancakes so had to give them a try, & they did not disappoint they definitely lived up to the hype, they were DELICIOUS! & on top of that my meal was only $8 and some change!! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Yep..I heard about these amazing red velvet pancakes and had to drag the family to that side of town and try em.
Of course the hubby had to try the grilled cheese and FF. They off the fries seasoned which is nice. His sandwich was pretty ordinary but he was happy.
I had the special which was a breakfast burrito and that came with 2 of the best pancakes EVER!!
They come with a small jar of cream cheese syrup and they are sprinkled with chocolate bits and a huge spoonful of whipped cream.
1st the burrito..it was perfect. I had ham in mine since my little guy loves it and we were sharing. We both tore into it. It had just the right amount of cheese,potato,ham, and eggs. We ate the whole thing.
Now onto the most wonderful pancakes in the world...
One word: YUMMY!!!!!
Go get some NOW!!! These are amazing. Then do some serious cardio cuz god only knows how much sugar/calories there are in them.
I also ate them both and did not share with the hubby or my baby!
LOL
Its a bit pricey..our bill was almost $24 bucks plus 5 buck tip. And it was on the other side of town. But I will drive here again  for THOSE pancakes.
Oh..service was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have found that this is the best Babystacks location. Food is consistently great. I always order the spam scramble with garlic rice and a side of lemon ricotta pancakes. When I am thinking of breakfast, this is the place I turn to."}
{"text":"Why is it that all the great spots to eat have limited seating ?
Quality over quantity.
Baby Cakes is delicious, my kids loved it and the service was great.
Portions are just enough and the price is right . Cant wait to visit again."}
{"text":"I hate the service here. Literally I hate it. I don't understand how unorganized one can be here. But its on my list of places that have scarred me because of service. 

Regardless. Food wise--they do take the cup for the best red velvet pancakes and burgers. 

Make sure to get the red velvet pancakes :)

I recommend going to the other one down south"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre. Adobo rice is more like soysauce rice, so unpleasant! Coffee is gross. Red velvet & carrot cake pancakes are good, sauce is just condensed milk though! I will go back only for the pancakes."}
{"text":"Amazin food and attention. Always packed so it's a bit of a wait sometimes, but I always get lucky. Adobo Fried Rice Omelette whaaat? Omg to die for! Pancakes are always decadent. Great place!"}
{"text":"What a great way to end our Las Vegas weekend! 

Some friends of ours decided to take us to \"Babystacks\" before we departed LV Sunday afternoon, I'm so glad they did! I've actually NEVER heard of Babystacks till that day but now I might actually make a pit stop whenever I'm in town! Babystacks as you've probably guessed is primarily known for their variety of pancake options.. I'm not much of a pancake fan so I opted for one of their signature dishes \"Chili Loco Moco\" along with a side of small order of macadamia nut pancakes to try. A friend of ours is an LV local and she suggested we order the Chilo Loco Moco with the adobe fried rice substitute so we can try 2 signature dishes into 1. Hence, our order was \"Can we have the chili loco moco but instead substitute the regular rice with adobe fried rice, hold on the onions, replace the burger patty with kalua pork, and also upgrade the side to a macadamia nut pancake?\" The waitress (so sorry I didn't catch your name) looked at me in shock and said \"Hold on, let me see if we can do that for you\" and came back 10 seconds later with a thumbs up! I was so happy they were able to accommodate to our complicated order LOL. 

It took awhile for our food to come (25 minutes or so), my assumption is because of our complicated order haha. When our food finally arrived, I was surprised to see the GENEROUS portions! As in, the food was falling off the plate because it was THAT MUCH! I'm so glad we sub'ed the regular rice with adobe fried rice because it definitely added some texture/flavor. I'm also a sauce person and the loco moco gravy was heavenly. The kalua pork was perfectly shredded and flavorful, at a heaping generous portion as well. Subbing the side dish with the macadamia nut pancake is highly recommended because we were able to try what the pancakes are all about! It was a bit overcooked (stale and dry) but otherwise sweet and delicious. Even with both my boyfriend and I sharing, was more than enough because we still had left overs to go! I'm so glad we were able to try Babystacks because I will definitely be back! 

Tip: Restaurant closes at 2pm on the weekdays and 3pm on weekends so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out.  The girl that took my order was not familiar with the menu at all.  She kept telling me they didnt have this and that when I've ordered numerous times before.  Arrived to pick up my order.  They showed me my food before packing it up.  And guess what...its wrong!  So they go to remake it, says will be 10 minutes, while my other order that was made correctly is sitting there getting cold.  So frustrating!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had an excellent experience at this place. All of the ingredients used for our meals were fresh and high quality.  I had the macadamia nut pancakes with white chocolate- yum! The sour dough bread was delicious, seemed almost home made. The eggs were fresh and cooked properly. The bacon was thick cut and the club sandwich was huge! The service was great considering it was super busy. They also have some authentic Hawaiian and Filipino dishes."}
{"text":"good portion size, lots of pancake selection, friendly service. large lunch selection. open till 2:00pm."}
{"text":"I am a Big fan of this place.  Love the steak and eggs with a side of the custom pancakes; favorites are bacon, cinnabun, cream sicle and lately the German chocolate pancakes.  Also try the garlic rice side instead of potatoes."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are EXCELLENT. They come with a cream cheese sauce or something like that. Honestly, you won't even need the sauce. They white choc macadamian nut pancakes were okay. A bit skimpy on the nuts! 

The potatoes and omelets did not look very tasty but surprisingly, they were delicious. Omelets a bit on the small side. Overall, pretty damn good. 

A short 10 min drive fromthe strip."}
{"text":"It gets pretty crowded here, so be prepared to wait.   Came here twice for breakfast and LOVED it.  Their adobo fried rice is delicious, their crepes are delicious, and their spam and eggs- YUMMMMMMY.  Was not a fan of their red velvet pancakes. It was a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"i really like everything so far about them. tried their hazelnut pancakes and they are yummy! but buttermilk is my favorite. would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few of my friends and the boyfriend on a very hot Las Vegas morning.  It was a Friday and it was packed!  We waited for a good amount of time but nothing too long.  The hostess seemed a little overwhelmed since he was trying to man the cash register, seat people and get the to go orders all at the same time.  Any case, he got through his list of things to do and we were seated in no time.  The menu is a little overwhelming.  There were so many options to choose from - from adobo fried rice to Portuguese sausage to the variety of pancakes and to sandwiches.  Again, it was overwhelming to choose what to eat!  In any case, we placed our ordered and waited for a good 10 minutes or so and we had our breakfast.

The boyfriend ordered the cookies and cream short stack.  It came with three pancakes and a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream.  As well as a side of cream cheese syrup.  He was in heaven.  He loved every bite of it.  I had a piece and it was just way toooooo sweet for me, but like I stated, it was perfect for the boyfriend.  I ordered Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice.  It was wrapped up in an omelette and I had a side of hash browns.  It was carbs on carbs.  The fried rice was a little too dry for me.  A part of me should have asked (if it was offered and doable) if I could get the eggs over easy.  The omelette was cooked a little too well done and if it was a little runny, it would have been great with the rice.  I love runny yolk with rice.  Overall, the flavor was great, it was a little too dry for my preference.  The other items that my friends ordered looked great and everyone loved their meal.  After it was all said and done, our bill came out to less than $70, which was great considering we ordered A LOT of food.  

Overall, the staff was attentive enough, the food was okay, there are so many options on the menu and the price point is decent.  Would I come back?  Why not.  I would like to try the other options they offer and they sure have on their menu a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"Got the spinach Benedict and tried a bite of the banana pancakes. Both delicious, awesome serving portions, I mean huge portions, but so good! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a really good brunch spot outside of the strip on this Sunday morning and lo & behold, we found one that went above and beyond our expectations! And since we decided to sit at the bar, we cut the hour-long wait! Now I love my pancakes, and I love red velvet, so when you put the two of them together, I don't think you can really go wrong. And their red velvet pancakes were oh-so right! I ordered the country fried steak with the babystack of red velvet and my boyfriend ordered the adobo fried rice, also with the red velvet -- SO SO GOOD! ESPECIALLY the pancakes! It tasted like fluffy clouds of red velvet goodness in my mouth, topped with delicious cream cheese syrup! I almost forgot I ordered anything else, my steak was so neglected! The adobo fried rice was pretty awesome too! Super flavorful and wrapped in egg like a burrito -- I ate most of my boyfriend's plate. I only took off a star because after we finished eating, we were kind of neglected and had to wait at least 20 minutes for our check. But don't go here without ordering their red velvet pancakes! You will absolutely regret it!"}
{"text":"All the pancakes are great. They have different varieties of pancakes they depends on what you are craving. Either sweet and/or salty. Pancakes are very creative. Since it's a breakfast/lunch/brunch restaurant, they are always busy and wait times can be up to an hour. It's a very popular restaurant. You can always call in an order in advance and pick it up if you don't want to wait for a table."}

{"text":"No amount of great food can make up for TERRIBLE customer service, inconsiderate and ridiculous  policies, lost my business over a stupid seating issue when your place is dead at the time with no one in the restaurant. Denny's has nicer employees down the street and faster service"}
{"text":"Last 2 times we went here wasn't very good. This time our omletes were way over cooked and browned without any flavor. The waitress forgot our coffee. The only reason they get 2 stars is the pancakes, they are good."}
{"text":"The wait sucks, but boy aren't those red velvet pancakes worth it! Portions are great and the waiters have been great as well. Everything I've ordered here has been really good. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This is a favorite of family. Every time we come here which is each and every trip.  You can't go wrong here.. lotsa tourists but mostly locals.. many return customers.. glad they have more locations!"}
{"text":"Great food.. I'll be back.. This is a good place to spoil yourself. I've been back to BabyStacks quite a few times and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here so I finally decided to leave a review . Food is great . Great atmosphere. Awesome pancakes! I had cookies and cream special this morning and it was spot on Oreos lol. It's a real cozy place (small ) so if your claustrophobic you might be slightly uncomfortable lol. But I def recommend it my only think they should improve on is the bacon wasn't that impressed but overall everything was too notch!"}
{"text":"If you are planning to come here to eat, don't think you will be seated right away. This place always has a wait, but the food is worth the wait.  My mom loves this place. Anytime I ask her where she wants to go to eat breakfast, she always says, \"You wanna go to Babystacks?\" and off we go. 

I'm not too much of a breakfast person, so I only order either grilled cheese, or pancakes haha! Whichever I order, I love it. They have red velvet pancakes, which are extremely delicious and sweet. A little too sweet for me, but still good.  My mom orders the senior breakfast, which is eggs made the way she likes them, hash browns, turkey bacon or sausage, toast or pancakes.  She loves her breakfast! 

Staff here are very kind as well. From the minute you walk, you are greeted. To be seated, as I mentioned could take a little while, but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times...Be prepared for a wait on weekends ...depends on the weekdays. 

Pancakes are always fluffy and good flavors so if you or someone you know LOVES pancakes this is the number on spot. My favorite so far is carrot cake. I tried banana cream pie today and is was pretty good. It had a whipped topping, cut bananas and almonds. I usually like the toppings but the banana pancake was good on its own. 

I had a classic breakfast today- I ordered Portuguese Sausage with two sunny side up eggs and garlic rice. This is the best way to order it cause you just put the eggs right over the rice and yum. If you don't like too much garlic and onions stick with regular rice. You do need a breath mint after eating. 

I like the food here and it's good. The price is okay and the servers were nice. You will enjoy this place but I recommend a small group so you don't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. They're open for lunch also, but I've  only had breakfast there.  Good service and really good breakfast food! Colorado skillet is my favorite!!  Pancakes are yummy also!"}
{"text":"Love when i find great new breakfast places in town. This place not only has the normal breakfast options but also more extravagant options like Red Velvet pancakes, Peanut Butter pancakes and Filipino Fare. The chicken adobo is to die for and so is the French Toast. I would suggest this breakfast spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Very yummy and quaint place. I was initially put off by the 45- 60 minute wait the hostess quoted our party of 5 on a Sunday but we ended up only waiting about 20 minutes. No one ordered the red velvet cakes so I could try them but I did sample the biscuits and gravy and well as the extremely buttery hash browns. I had the Adobo friend rice.... fried rice wrapped in an omelete. If it had some sort of yummy sauce on it (hollandaise?) it might have been superb, nevertheless, it was very tasty. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive to our needs. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place gets a three star because of the waitress who took care of me. From the beginning I asked questions regarding the famous adobo omelette. I ended up ordering it and opted out for the red velvet mini pancakes. 

The adobo omelette was a huge disappointment. Given, the owners are Filipino, the adobo was horrible. Filipino adobo is based on, garlic, vinegars and black pepper with a touch of soy sauce. This omelette tasted more like shredded chicken over rice and tossed in Kikkoman Soy Sauce! Tasted exactly just that!  I couldn't even proceed to eat it even after adding ketchup! 

The server asked how I was doing and told her I didn't want to eat the salty soy sauce chicken omelette and she offered me something else. I told her I would pay for it and to get me the loco moco. I have to admit, the gravy on the loco mock was good. I paid extra for the garlic rice and the patty on the loco moco tasted good as well! 

Service provided made the experience well after a bad start. When back in the area, I will be back to try something else on the menu. It seems like their pancakes are the actual business."}
{"text":"It's a long wait and they're only open for a few hours but the food there is sooo good. They have many different types of pancake flavors. Red velvet is a must try! I always get the chicken adobo fried ride so good!  it makes me feel like I'm back home in Hawaii. :)"}
{"text":"First visit!  Nice atmosphere! Friendly servers! Great service!  
I had the Mexican Omelet. It had Carnitas, peppers, topped with cheese salsa and lots of sour cream.  It worked!  Sour Cream really made the difference!  Hash Browns and sourdough toast was \"Dennys\" quality.  Nothing special. 
My wife had the Sweet cream crepes topped with strawberries. The Sweet cream filling was soupy. Strawberries must have been out of season cause I counted maybe a dozen slices of strawberries. Nothing special. 
Would certainly go back for the omelet I had."}
{"text":"Love this place... Great food & awesome service. We always come here when we come to Vegas.. Loco moco is #1, great pancakes as well.."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in vegas! The red velvet pancakes are so good!! Nothing like them anywhere else, it is definitely one of their signature items. This place has a hawaiian inspired menu with many other american breakfast items. You will find something on the menu that you like, no matter what you're craving. So good!"}
{"text":"I wish yelp had half stars as baby stacks is more of a 3.5 star kind of place. That's not really a knock on this business. The vibe is island style and the restaurant has a relaxing feel. The menu has a ton of pancake options but has other more traditional options like omelette says well as island flavor a like loco moco. 

I had the loco moco which was very good. The patty was big and thick and juicy. It seemed to be made from scratch. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the gravy was rich and dark. I got a side of bacon pancakes. I was hoping for better cakes. Mine were flat and dense and slightly chewy. The flavor was there, but the texture was not. 

My wife had the chicken fried steak and eggs with carrot cake pancakes. Her steak tasted a bit off although it was nicely fried. Maybe the oil was on its way out. She loved the sausage gravy but was nonplussed by the thick, undercooked hash browns. Her pancakes were thin and tender and had lots of spice. They tasted like carrot cake and were very good. 

The service overall was good, yet our food took almost 30 minutes to arrive. The table next to us was having issues too. Maybe the kitchen was in the weeds as it was late morning on a Sunday. Our server did check on us several times and refilled our coffees constantly. 

If you like a large selection of \"dessert\" pancakes then you'll probably like baby stacks. If you're more of a traditional pancakes person you may prefer a different place. If you want loco moco this is your pace!"}
{"text":"The place is fairly small. Great friendly servers. It seemed like the kitchen was just as big as the dining room. This place is famous for their red velvet pancakes served with a sugar glaze. At the end of your meal you pay at the front counter. Make sure your whole party is with you as they will not seat you if you are missing people.

I thought the huevos rancheros plate was kind of all over the place, still good but more cheese would of made it better. Also served along with home made potatoes."}
{"text":"this place is so amazing. the food is GREAT. so many choices, the pancakes are great, service is amazing. very happy!"}
{"text":"I just popped in here today while running errands real quick, not expecting much. I got a build your own scramble with toast and made a sandwich with it, it was crazy good! I was not expecting so much flavor! Perfect portion for me. Service was quick and friendly. Iam giving three stars because my avocado was not fresh,  kinda dark and mushy. I enjoyed the t.v at the counter."}
{"text":"Pancake craving? So good...pancakes of all flavors. Can get busy so I suggest going early. Service is good."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting this place to be so busy at noon! The atmosphere at this restaurant is really cozy and welcoming. It feels very local and homegrown. The servers were very attentive and food came out at a decent time. The food was so delicious! If you're a person who doesn't always finish your food (like me), get any short stack pancakes for only about $6. I decided to get the Cinnabun pancakes and they were *italian finger kiss* really good."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly.  Great food for the price.  I'm almost always here after a long night shift."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast place in Las Vegas.. Definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Bomb.Com!!!! 
This place was awesome all around. The service was friendly, the place had a good islander vibe (reminded me of Hawaii), and the menu had something for everyone from many varieties of pancakes, French toast, omelettes, and breakfast combos. As for the food, well let me just say it was amazingly delicious!!! 

I ordered the spam, eggs, and potatoes with pancakes. And of course I upgraded those bad boys to the banana cream pancakes. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I wasn't able to finish. But I had to try both. The spam juicy and cooked just right, the eggs were done the way I like, and the potatoes were yummy. Everything had good flavor and paired well together. The banana cream pancakes was so rich and like a dream you don't want to end. It tasted just like pie, with a buttermilk pancake crust. Sooo good, and worth trying. 

My wife ordered the shredded pork and rice omelette with a short stack of rocky road pancakes. She loved it and couldn't finish her meal as well. Had some bites and I must say what we both ordered was flavorful and a good filling breakfast. 
Good portion breakfast plates, delicious pancakes, good coffee, friendly service, and worth trying."}
{"text":"BabyStacks Cafe brings me back to island life because of their ono grindz, island music, and kamaaina-esque service. This place sort of reminds me of Eggs 'n Things and Koa Pancake House in Hawaii, but comparing BabyStacks to those places just isn't fair.

BabyStacks is your typical breakfast/brunch joint with an island/filipino-inspired flare. Their menu items include the usual eggs, bacon, sausage, crepes, french toast, pancakes (large variety), etc. but if you're looking for something more (I'm talkin' to all ya'll Pacific Islander Yelpers) they also have spam, Portuguese sausage, loco moco (with the choice of garlic fried rice), Kalua pig (benedict), adobo fried rice (omelette), etc. 

The restaurant is quite small and fills up rather quickly, but for our party of 7 (arriving after about an hour and a half of opening) only waited for about 15 minutes. Not too bad. I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and thanks to my family, I was able to try bites of the Kalua Pig Benedict and Nutella Crepes. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was delicious! The rice is fried with Filipino-style chicken adobo, wrapped inside a fried egg (hence, \"omelette\"), and garnished with scallions. The portion they serve is big enough for two people, so if you're not too hungry or want to try more things on the menu, I'd suggest sharing. The Kalua Pig Benedict was also very good. The pork was cooked and seasoned well. I wouldn't mind ordering it on my next visit. The Nutella crepe was just alright. I prefer my crepes to be thinner. The thickness of the crepe topped with cream made it a little soggy for my taste. If you do decide to order crepes I'd, again, suggest sharing it because they're huge! Talk about kanak-attack!!!

They also have daily specials that aren't menu regulars, so if you're looking for a unique breakfast experience check this place it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place- just tried it and we'll be visiting again. Super mall place so expect some wait time. Loved the red velvet pancakes. The service was great."}
{"text":"Came out to Vegas for a birthday trip. Always love trying local spots. This one had some amazing reviews and whelp it lived up to them. Pancakes were fluffy and delicious. Garlic rice brings back grandma memories so that was also a plus. All in all a great spot for some good breakfast. When we come back this will still be on my yelp list to come back and try"}
{"text":"Truly great breakfast place if you have the taste buds for sweets! My all time favorite to order is the red velvet pancakes. The pancakes are really pretty and very delicious. It comes with whip cream on top and a yummy sauce to add to it. I also like their adobo fried rice omelet. This restaurant gets moderately busy and average wait time is about 15-30 minutes. The menu is easy to read and the servers are helpful. At the end of the meal you pay up front."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast! Service was quick and the food came out hot. We would come back."}
{"text":"Great service (cute Hispanic girl) always kept my husband and my coffee filled, great food, awesome menu!!! red velvet pancakes are the biz!!!!!!! My new favorite spot!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I was more of a morning person so I could enjoy breakfast more often. I've been here a few times and it never disappoints. I ordered a skillet and it was great. The service was good and my coffee cup was never empty. If you're looking for some good food, look no further. My only request is that the music in the restaurant be a little lower so you can hear your server and the people with you a little better."}
{"text":"Very good pancakes, the red velvet are like eating a doughnut and the adobo rice is awesome. The staff r friendly and atmosphere relaxed and pleasant"}
{"text":"3rd time here and can't find what's so great.  SLOW SLOW SERVICE. ..eggs? They cook in 5 minutes why the 33 min wait for food? 
AND TODAY THE FANCY MALE SERVER DIDN'T EVEN HEAR MY ORDER...REALLY? brought my daughters pancakes and looked at me like I was crazy. I told him \"what to you think? I was just going to watch HER eat?\"
Not very sympathetic either...very snooty. I was so upset NO I didn't ask for the management. I would of made a seen!
Why the hell as a server would you not say....SO your don't want anything?  RETARDED 
Ugh! 
NOT GOING BACK I was trying to like it. I really was.  
DISSATISFIED DISAPPOINTED and frankly sad. 
& food is average.  IF it was great I could over look the wait and all the RULES they have.  No splitting checks, sit here, pay up there. Wait outside. Oh I didn't hear you order. FOOEY"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times were so good! It's small so sometimes there is a wait but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to be said this place is awesome and always busy so get here early and enjoy."}
{"text":"Wasn't too excited about service, but food was excellent! Baby stacks forever hits the spot, and I will continue to give my business!

Thanks again Baby Stacks!!"}
{"text":"No matter how many different breakfast spots I'll try, BabyStacks Cafe will always be one of my favorites!
 
I have been to every location countless times & they have the friendliest servers.
 
Everything I have ordered here, I enjoyed. There are so many options to choose from & I always have a hard time deciding what I want because I want it all! However, I am obsessed with their pancakes! I always have to get a short stack, even if it's to share, because their pancakes are so perfect.

You should expect there to be a wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Baby stacks was delicious!  I had spinach Benedict and loved every bite of it. I'll definitely be going back. The servers were all very friendly. The only thing is the restaurant is small."}
{"text":"Had family breakfast everybody was happy with the food... it has a comfy feel to it great if you don't just want a chain breakfast experience. Service was nice and friendly only thing the never refilled any of our drinks"}
{"text":"We ended up going here when we were looking for a quick breakfast one morning.  We had actually planned on going to the donut shop next door, but their selections was lackluster to say the least.   The restaurant was PACKED when we got in there.  Every table except one two seater was full.  It was too crowded to easily walk through, but in had a pleasant vibe.  It must be said I DO NOT like pancakes.  My husband ordered cinnabon pancakes and I ordered pumpkin pancakes with a side of homefries.  Ordering was a challenge as the employees were standing in front of the specials board and we couldn't read it.  Breakfast came out in a timely manner.  The pancakes were smaller than I expected for the price.  The syrups that came out were also very small.  We bother requested regular syrup on the side.  The white icing style syrup that came with mine was AWESOME and the highlight of the trip.  My husband was disappointed with his meal bc the pancakes were too small and stacked poorly on the plate so the syrup ran off the side.  The homefries were good, similar in flavor to the Egg and I.  We are not likely to go back to this place...  just not a good value for the money"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here was delicious! The Kalua pork grilled cheese is my favorite! Service is great. They get really busy on the weekends and don't take reservations but he wait is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! It was crowded but the wait was not bad! Service was great and very family friendly!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I ordered the veggie garden skillet and the Nutella crepe which arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. Both were delicious! The crepe did get a little soggy by the time I went to eat it but then again I left it on the side until I was done with my skillet. I recommend ordering it at the end or eating it first. Service was good overall. The guy at the front with glasses and blonde tips was very efficient. He seemed to be seating everyone and made sure my water was always full too."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I make sure I stop here. Red velvet pancakes to die for! Tried the Ricks pork Fried Rice this time as well. Def lives up to the hype. Will be back again as usual. Until next time Vegas..."}
{"text":"Holy food portions and goodness. While you may never get your bill (???), the food and service was fantastic. The combinations of salty sand sweet will cure any Las Vegas hangover!"}
{"text":"Nicole is a terrific server. 

I was craving a breakfast burrito,  I'm always concerned about the burritos sizes. 

All I can say is I was full after my breakfast burrito, I got sausage for the meat part.

It's delicious I'm happy with my overall experienced, I also love the fact that Nicole came up to me and asked if it tasted good. Two thumbs up!!! That shows me that she cares about how I'm enjoying the food which makes me feel welcomed and loved!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes & Adobo fried rice omelet delish!!! Best brekfast spot in vegas"}
{"text":"Delicious food. My taste buds were clowning. Great service. Thank you, I enjoyed every bit of the food."}
{"text":"Amazing location near our hotel. Great service. Delicious pancakes and just a nice environment"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes were awesome. Had a great time visiting with family.  Was pleasantly surprised with the variety of food options.  Super nice waitstaff!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I love Babystacks! Where do I even begin? After visiting multiple times and trying various omelettes, pancakes, and sides, I can say without a doubt that this is my go-to breakfast spot in Vegas.  As far as pancakes go, I absolutely *love* the banana fosters for a sweet but not overly sweet stack of pancakes. The red velvet is great if you've got a real sweet tooth. The strawberry pancakes and blueberry pancakes are great for a more simple but still tasty option. As for omelettes, I prefer to build my own. The Huntington and Mexican are the two set omelettes that I've enjoyed the most. I also can't say enough about the biscuits and gravy-- yum."}
{"text":"My first time here and hubby. The place was packed so we're advised to wait for 15 to 20 mins. It was Sunday and what a busy place.

I ordered Portuguese sausage, eggs with garlic fried rice and house regular pancakes. Everything I tasted was delicious. Carrot pancake is to die for. The portion and preparation was excellent. The waitress is very professional and she make sure that we got all we need. I absolutely recommend these place to all my friends and would love to come back for my pancakes craving. Is it worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This probably is one of the worst breakfast restaurants we've been to. We went there twice just to see the consistency of the food. The first time was good the second time it totally missed the mark. The order we received as far being not good was different than the first. Let me explain, I ordered the two egg breakfast special and I specifically ordered the eggs medium because I hate runny eggs. Anyways, I received them runny. This restaurant is pricey for what it is, the quality is not there. If its food was worth it I could see the justification for the prices."}
{"text":"OMGEEE LEMON ricotta lemon pancakes were the highlight of our meal!  Next time I'm getting the large order of this and bathing in the \"syrup\"

The Mexican skillet was pretty delicious.  Crispy carnitas, spicy jalapenos and creamy sour cream really made the dish

I ordered a breakfast burrito, wet with gravy...oink oink

The cinnabun pancakes were too sweet for me personally but well enjoyed by others.

A group of five ate \"family style\" so I got to try a couple of dishes.  Our server was a very sweet young lady.  She was attentive and our order, albeit modifications, came out exactly as requested.  Kudos to her!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I just thought this place was okay.

I'm not really a fan of tight sitting quarters when I'm enjoying breakfast. Id much rather feel as though I can lounge, enjoy my coffee, and have a conversation that 20 other diners are privy to hearing. So, as for ambiance, I'd give the place a 1

The food was alright. Maybe I'm just partial to the places I've grown up with (The Egg and I, Blueberry Hill), but even still, I cant say the food is that great. The scrambled eggs had a very strange coconut flavor to them that caught me a bit off guard in a kind of unpleasant way. My pancakes tasted like, well, pancakes. Nothing I could not have gotten at IHOP (and I hate IHOP) Maybe I should have tried their famous Red Velvet pancakes, but not being a fan of anything Red Velvet, I didn't see how a pancake would possibly be so good as to change my mind.

The service was what one would expect in a busy breakfast joint with limited seating; nonexistent. I cant say they were rude, but nobody seemed to engage with us or give me any reason to feel welcomed. I felt as though I was being rushed out of my seat the moment the food was sat down on the table. 

The only reason I cant give this place a much lower rating is because I'm sure there are people who love their famous Stack of RV, and because I didn't try it, I cant say the food is all that bad. Its just not my favorite. Coffee was great, and bacon was prepared perfectly. Had it have not been for the seating arrangement and the service I could have given this place a 4 star rating. It's just okay for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food, never disappoints! I recommend the cookies and cream pancakes, but that's just a personal favorite. They have something for everyone here for Sure. The portions are huge for what you pay and they never skimp on quality. Also, we've never waiting longer than 5 minutes for a table during their busy times. Staff is friendly and it's a great spot to bring out of town visitors to."}
{"text":"Headed (way) off-strip to try this little cafe with my son, based purely on the strong Yelp review. Despite being some twenty minutes from our hotel, it did not disappoint! 

We arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday and waited about 20 minutes for a table. Not too bad considering the size, which is pretty small.

My son ordered the standard Buttermilk pancakes with a side of bacon and I had Honey Whole Wheat pancakes. In a nutshell, everything was terrific! The bacon was thick and generous and the pancakes were a good size and prepared perfectly! I resent not ordering the Red Velvet, after seeing it delivered to the table next to us, but that is what next time is for!

Certainly worth the trip if you're in the city and want to avoid a $40 room service omelet or the ridiculous buffet lines. Can't wait to come back and give it another go!"}
{"text":"Came here one day because we had originally wanted to get an adobo fried rice omelet from Aloha Kitchen, but it was way far...so our friends suggested this spot.  We came in right after the 6:30 mass near by and we were sure happy we did, because about 5 minutes after we got seated, the place got PACKED!  

Anyway, we got exactly what we came for, the adobo fried rice omelet.  If you've never tried it...gotta go.  They also have these pretty good red velvet pancakes; which definitely taste more dessert-ish than they do pancak-ish, he he he.  But we all enjoyed our food and the service was excellent.  

A little far in my opinion, when there are other options near by, but if it was close to me, I'd definitely go pretty often!"}
{"text":"Super great food !
Waiter seemed nice nothing over the top.
When it was time for check out the hostess taking the payment seemed annoyed that all 3 of us were paying separate and literally gave us a calculator to know how much each of us owed... seriously???!!... I figure the only explanation for that is that she didn't know basic math."}
{"text":"A great place to pop into for brunch! They have a ton of options on the menu ranging from traditional pancakes and waffles to their own specialty house creations. There is a bit of an underlying Hawaiian/Filipino theme to the food and it is excellent! They make a mean Loco Moco - a Hawaiian dish of garlic rice topped with a burger patty, fried egg and gravy. It may sound strange, but trust me, it's delicious! 

If you come here on a holiday or weekend be prepared for a bit of a wait. I've never been here when it wasn't packed. Also, if you come with a group be aware that they are no longer splitting checks so you'll need to bring cash or plan to Venmo the person who ends up taking care of the bill."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place.  Had the honey French toast and the Cinnabon pancakes.  Have to say they were both quite amazing.   Great service, top quality breakfast food and a reasonable price to boot.  Looking forward to making this our Sunday morning breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Looking for a great brunch spot, this is the place! The portions are big and if you are craving some good flavored pancakes and moco locos, you need to get them here!

[Environment] Roomy and spacious to walk around; especially during the busy brunch time hours. It can get pretty chatty but you can still socialized amongst your friends and family.

[Service] The staff here is friendly and prompt. Even through the hectic brunch hours they still remain friendly and are patient with you. So don't feel rushed. Our drinks were always topped off and we really felt welcomed

[Food] The food was delicious. I enjoyed my Chili Moco Loco, the portion was really big for the price and had to take some home. The crepes were also yummy, topped with fresh fruits of your choice and NUTELLA! The red velvet pancakes was also yummy! They come out in red and look pretty cool!

Overall, I enjoyed it here and was a satisfied. If you are looking for a good brunch this, this is the place! 

[ See it, Taste it, Yelp it! ]"}
{"text":"I would eat there every morning if I could but I know I would only gain weight.

Love their different varieties of pancakes, my favorite red velvet."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! We were told a 15 min wait for 5 people, and after 35 minutes, we were still waiting. We requested 3 times for them to push empty tables together to make room for us, and they declined. Don't bother going if you have more than 4 people. Hostesses are unwilling to think outside the box."}
{"text":"Loco moco was perfect and the macaroni salad was delish! Will def come again. People were really nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Aloha is heartfelt and food is Ono! The pancakes were really good. We had the original babystacks pancake, Mac nut chocolate pancake, and chocolate chip pancake. All were really good and fluffy. Good coffee. We also got spinach eggs benedict and spam and eggs. Waitress was very warm and welcoming. We arrived before 9am on Monday and we're seated right away. There was a 20 min wait by the time we left."}
{"text":"By far the best place for breakfast! The service is on point and the food is outstanding!! This was my first time trying this place, and I'm so glad I did!! I will definitely be back!! Preston in particular is a wonderful server! The wide variety of pancakes will leave you indecisive, they all sound great! I can't wait to come back and try some more! :)"}
{"text":"Before departing Vegas, we needed some brunch.

Came here and the wait was about 30 minutes.

Ordered the Filipino Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with hashbrowns and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes.

Wow! The omelette wasn't just all rice. There was actually pork adobo in it and you can taste the adobo. The red velvet pancakes were amazing. I couldn't finish all my food and needed a to-go box for later.

Great stuff!"}
{"text":"They red velvet pancakes! That says it all- when friends come to visit they get a kick out of the menu selections of pancakes!!"}
{"text":"A must place to visit when in Henderson, Nevada. The shredded chicken adobo omelette was bomb.com'"}
{"text":"Every time a newcomer is in town, this is our breakfast cafe of choice. Can't beat the signature red velvet pancakes or the any of the Hawaiian inspired dishes. Got there by 830a on Sunday and the place was already packed by 9:30, so always try to get there as early as possible or you will be waiting 45+ minutes. This past weekend I tried the lemon ricotta pancakes (not a big fan of lemon, so...not a big fan of these), Bananas foster pancakes (my new fave!!), and spam scramble (delicious, but trying to cut my meat intake ;). Other great pancake dishes are the White Chocolate pancakes and cinnabun, both super delish, but I do have a huge sweet tooth so I may be biased."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch as we saw this new location.  The restaurant was not too busy and the layout is fine.  The waitress was friendly, but scarce at times.  The ranchero omelet was great with nice green salsa.  My wife really enjoyed the carrot cake pancakes.  Overall:  very good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great service . We regularly go to the one on Stephanie and I have to say the difference in quality of food makes the drive worth it . We had a large party , most of whom ordered a variety of different pancakes. All agreed they were fantastic ! We still highly recommend the red velvet as the staple best . I personally ordered lunch today and the BLT was great ."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The food never disappoints and the staff is very attentive... The food has decent portions and the prices are externally reasonable. The only down side is it's always crowded but surely worth the wait. Today wasn't bad we only had to wait 15 minutes."}
{"text":"It's a good cafe, but I wouldn't say it's amazing. I got a skillet and a side of red velvet pancakes (which are their top dishes), and both of them came in within 15 minutes which is pretty long wait for a restaurant. The red velvet pancakes were fluffy and flavorful, but the skillet was like a normal skillet with no special ingredients or anything. I'd come back but it's not a must for me."}
{"text":"This place is a must go! The food was amazing and and the service was equally as good. Ask for Efren! Best service I've had in a long time. We will be back."}
{"text":"My family is a brunch family; so when they came to town this week, I finally headed the long-time advice of a co-worker, and took them out to BabyStacks.

This is a problem, because I live next door to BabyStacks, and Babystacks is wonderful. The menu is that perfect pokemon inducing length where you absolutely want to try everything, and that seems like a totally achievable goal.

I had the Orange Dreamsicle Pancakes, which were actual orange flavored, and just lightly sweet. The cream cheese syrup and fluffy homemade whipped cream made them a real treat, and rounded out the flavors. I got a side of bacon that was crispy, flavorful, and perfect, and a nice bottomless cup of coffee, as brunch requires.

My mom had the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes, and from the taste we swapped, they were amazing. My dad had the Strawberry, and would not take a break from inhaling them to answer any questions. He also refused to share. High praise indeed.

I'll be back to Babystacks soon, and often. YUM."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  Pancakes of all kinds are on the menu.  The Ortega Skillet was yummy, I subbed bacon and sausage for the chicken.  Tropical Island French Toast was amazing.  Lemon Ricotta pancakes were delicious.  Will come back next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaaaamazing. I had the orangecicle pancakes and of course the works with all the sides! Demolished. I scarfed it all down like a fatty. Didn't snap one picture. !!! But next time . :)Reggae much good vibes great food."}
{"text":"BabyStacks has always been my FAVORITE breakfast place in town! I used to always go after school, work, or just on a free day if I can. 

The environment is super friendly & inviting! Every time I go, I want to try something new, but there's some items on the menu that I ALWAYS have to order! I always get their Strawberry Lemonade (which is refillable) & their red velvet pancakes! I've had red velvet pancakes at other restaurants, but no one does it like BabyStacks! It's not too sweet, and it'll leave you wanting more. The cream & syrup they use is honestly so perfect. 

I've ordered everything from omelettes, skillets, crepes, to loco mocos and every dish was just perfect to me. If you're looking for a spot for filling, and great tasting breakfast/lunch, this is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I love this place......it really puts Ihop to SHAME. If you come on a busy day, rest assured the \"30 minute\" wait is about half that. The service is quick and wonderful. And, the best part is the food is AMAZING! I haven't ordered anything I didn't fall in love with! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's just really good food, expect a 30-40 min wait, but worth it, pop into Sierra Gold next door for a drink while ya wait."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back to this place. We got the bacon pancakes, red velvet and hazelnut pancakes. We also got the spam and garlic rice. Everything was really yummy the pancakes were bomb!! The prices are reasonable but the portions are definitely only enough for one person. We got there at 9 on a Friday morning and there was no wait. But when we were leaving about an hour later the place was packed and a line heading out the doors. My only complaint is that they don't have one here in Cali :( . Please consider coming out here, preferably in the IE"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Vegas! The Carrot Cakes are to die for! For those who want something a little less sweet you can't go wrong with an omelette. I'm a big fan of their tomatillo sauce. I never come to Vegas without stopping by."}
{"text":"So amazing!!!! The red velvet pancakes are to die for! This place gets a little busy so you have to come at the right time. Always worth the wait and the drive from Mountians Edge for this place! 

Can't wait for the new location to open!"}
{"text":"Great Place. I got the tip in a German Forum and tried it myself during my visit in 2014. The coffee was very good and the banana fosters short stack is absolutely delicious. For all who are in Vegas it's the place to have an awesome breakfast."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE EVER.

The wait is a while, if it is your first time you will soon understand why. Their eggs and bacon are normal, nothing crazy. Their potatoes are great. Their pancakes are literally heaven in your mouth. I'm serious. Be sure to try the Red Velvet ones... oh, and the Banana Creme Pie ones... mmmmm my mouth is watering...

The drive is about 20 minutes out for me, but it's worth it every time.

Please open one up in the Henderson area soon, please!"}
{"text":"Definitely enough unique pancakes! I don't see it as amazing, but everything tasted good.  Service was a little slow, my omelette was only ok, but I if I wanted pancakes, I know I would come back."}
{"text":"Love this place but because it's small, I usually order take out. Today when I called at 10:58 I was told it would be 20 minutes which is the norm. I just left at 11:44 with my food. I don't know if it's because there was a new hostess but another person complained about the same thing. 

When I addressed it, the host simply said \"oh...almost an hour?\" I said \"yes. I called at 10:58l. She just swiped my card and asked me to sign for my receipt. I understand new employees learn on the job, but an apology would have been nice considering I come here a lot and recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

being that this place is the hottest ish on yelp i hadddd to try it. 

on a friday around noon there was no wait for 4 people. yay! 

i had the loco moco which comes with 2 eggs, gravy, 2 home made hamburger patties, rice, and mac salad. let's start with the good. eggs were cooked just right and the gravy was reallllly good. the hamburger patties were just okay. it seemed like they had been pre-cooked and re-heated. the meat was very tough. it was like a day old bbq hamburger patty. i'm used to the really tender thin hamburger patties so this may just be preference. the mac salad was not good to me at all. there was a lot of black pepper and something else i couldn't quite figure out. i shared this with a friend but it really wasn't enough food to share. he didn't like the mac salad either but enjoyed everything else.

sooo the real reason why i came here was to try the red velvet pancakes everyone is talking about. and yes. it lives up to the hype! the pancakes are very light, fluffy, and not overly sweet. the whipped cream on top seems home made and can be compared to a marshmallow flavor. yum! the cream cheese syrup is sweet and has the perfect syrupy consistency. 

my other friends shared eggs benedict and half was done well and the other half was overcooked. they also got regular pancakes and really like them. 

overall service was friendly but on the slow side. it took a while to get our food. the tables are set up in a way where it's very congested and it's not a great place for groups if you have more than 6 people. 

i absolutely fell in love with the red velvet pancakes but i'm not sure if i would come back for their lunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food.  The portions are generous and the food is delicious.  The cookie butter French toast is amazing.  This is a must try for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was their this morning and it was plenty of seats available. What a friendly environment! Food, price 3 stars & environment, service 5 stars! You get plenty food it was way over cooked. (taste 3 star look 5 star)"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite breakfast place in town.  The choices for  pancakes are awesome & I like the other stuff such as the skillets.   Service is always friendly & great.   I've been to their other locations as well & they are all amazing.   Great place,  great food,  great staff. Great job."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite breakfast place in Vegas! I got lucky and this new location is right down the road from my house. It's smaller than the other location I usually visit but luckily I have visited on weekday mornings and not on the weekends. Since the location is small I would imagine if you came mid-morning or later on the weekends you would probably have to wait a while. For this reason I'd get there early if you go on the weekends.

Our service has always been good. The waiters are attentive and have good customer service skills. 

They always have great pancakes and you can always add the speciality pancakes to any breakfast. This is what I always do so I can have the egg, sausage, etc breakfast with something yummy and sweet!

Today I decided to get the two egg breakfast with my eggs done over easy along with the potatoes with the tiramisu pancakes. I also decided to get a side of toast so I could dip it in my eggs. The tiramisu pancakes were the limited edition pancake so I had to try that. They were amazing! I recommend them if they are still on the menu when you visit. The eggs were also very good and I enjoyed them with my toast.

If you come here you MUST try the pancakes. You cannot go wrong with any of the different flavors they have although their red velvet is their best seller."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast restaurant in all of Las Vegas! I really love restaurants that are local and not just another chain restaurant which is what Babystacks is; a great local place. This place is always busy so if you don't want to wait make sure you get there early; especially on the weekends! The pancakes are amazing as well as the omelettes and skillets. My favorite pancake there has to be either the infamous Red Velvet or Butterfinger. It's two hard to decide between the two! My goal is one day try every single pancake :) The great thing about this restaurant is you can still get an omelette or skillet and still be able to have a side of their delicious pancakes. My favorite skillet is the Mexican skillet. If you like spicy this is a must try! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is a breakfast food lover and wanting to experience delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"Baby stacks is one of my most missed places to eat. The variety of pancakes yet I could pick one blindfolded off of the menu and never go wrong. Ever since I've started my clean eating I'm reminiscing on my foodie places and writing yelp reviews for them. I miss you baby stacks... I miss you!"}
{"text":"Staff was rude , gave us wrong check and couldn't fix it because the other table already paid and left . Food was alright burger wasn't seasoned at all , steak was good pancakes were alright"}
{"text":"Gemreat place. Portions were perfect and the food was on point. The red velvet pancakes that they are known for did not disapoint."}
{"text":"Busy place with a bit of a wait! Food was great! I had the bananas foster pancakes, eggs and potatoes!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I give 5 stars but this place was deserving. Everything we had (corned beef hash, spam and eggs) was delicious and not even a hint of grease. The eggs and pancakes were light, buttery and fluffy. 

We head back to SoCal tomorrow and this will be our breakfast stop on the way out."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!  All the pancakes are great, with the carrot cake being my favorite.  The fried rice omelette is unbelievable.  Although it may be crowded, the service is fast and tables open up relatively quickly."}
{"text":"Being from LA baby stacks was introduced to us by our good friends who live locally. Our first visit was at the Henderson location and from what we remember it was exceptional. Coming from there we expect everything to be the same. The dining area is clean and dare I say hip? The staff is friendly and accommodate to their customers and that's always important to us as patrons. The wait time for us was quick although we arrived 1hr before closing so we caught the tail end of people leaving.  

We ordered the usual breakfast items with the exception of the abobo omelette which I'm sorry but Aloha kitchen is far better. It was rather small and the taste wasn't anything to write home about. I think the biggest disappointment was the original pancake and that was a big surprise considering they are called baby stacks. It was super dry dispite having butter and being drenched in syrup. I literally couldn't swallow it and end up spitting it out which was the 1st time ever! Congratulations on becoming the worst pancake I have ever had in my 40 years of life. They did remake it and it was a little better but I now know I truly dislike pancakes that are cake like. On the flip side we also had the red velvet pancakes which was more palatable and pleasant to eat, I'm guessing it's because red velvet was originally meant to be a cake. I don't think I will be returning to this location. Seriously if a normal pancake won't pass muster then we're pretty much done."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and the food is always delicious. The lemon ricotta crepes are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at babystacks and I genuinely love vibe from this place...it feels like home. The service is great, specifically, our waiter who was really fantastic! The food is pretty good, but personally, I have had better. As most of the other reviews stated, the pancakes are the star of the show. I had the hazelnut pancakes which were good, but I wish the hazelnuts were incorporated into the batter instead of sprinkled on top. The whipped cream however, was absolutely delicious! I also got the Kahlua grilled cheese which lacked a little flavor, but was alright. Overall, still good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Amazing Red Velvet Pancakes...this we all know.  Just thought I would mention that the pumpkin pancakes had a tad too much nutmeg and ginger for my taste.... and I LOVE pumpkin pancakes.  Took one bite and could hardly finish it...won't make that mistake again.

Suggested a Henderson location so I wouldn't have to drive so far and a little birdy told me it's in the works...hmmmmmm can I say excited?  (Driving 20 miles to wait 25 minutes to sit can get old.)  Fingers Crossed.."}
{"text":"mehhhhhh. This place is just... ok to me. I agree with Arnold D...I don't understand the hype. I've been here a couple times . I've tried biscuits and gravy, Kahlua pig Benedict, a turkey sandwich, corned beef and hash, fried rice & of course the infamous red velvet pancakes. It's not that it didn't taste good it was just that nothing stood out. Nothing was amazing or 5 star worthy, just your standard diner tasting food. I love the concept of the place and the little fusion thing going on. But to be honest I prefer breakfast at The Egg and I or Blueberry Hill.."}
{"text":"What a great meal! Our food was delicious- we tried two different specialty pancakes (banana foster and carrot cake) and were impressed. Our waitress, Amanda, was attentive and our glasses never emptied. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We here with a bud on a Friday morning for breakfast to try out their Red Velvet Pancakes.  They were indeed good!  Definitely like eating dessert for breakfast, so get something else to go with them like eggs and bacon.

The wait was a bit long and not really much of a place to sit and wait.  Decent experience.  I am indifferent about returning :)"}
{"text":"OMG!!! First time we ever went & let me tell you it was AMAZING!
My son had a kids meal, I had red velvet pancakes(BOMB.com) & my husband had corned beef & eggs!
LOVED it will be back soon."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the long line to get in for a Monday morning, until I tasted the food. Pumpkin pancakes are on the specials board, and they were delicious and fluffy, not dense like many pumpkin pancakes tend to be. The Kalua Pig Benedict was wonderful, and the Orange dreamsicle was outrageously flavorful. The cream cheese frostings that came with the pancakes were flavored to match the dish, pumpkin spice and orange flavored respectively, which made each dish that much more cohesive and delicious."}
{"text":"I use to travel all the way to the southwest side of town to visit baby cakes..I'm glad they have one close to my place but just wasn't impressed.the service was good but my Benedict's was swimming in hollandaise sauce. I have been to the other 2 locations and their food is way better."}
{"text":"Food was great! Especially loved the gravy.  Huge chunks of sausage in the gravy.  Service was fast and attentive.  Hostest had WAY TO MUCH MAKEUP ON, but made for fun interaction with my wife as we ate.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Babystacks twice. Each time it was fairly busy. People on Yelp seem to like it well enough. I was enticed by the photos of meals and pancake creations. However, each time I've been here, I've been underwhelmed by the main dish I chose (first time was adobe fried rice omelette, second time was country fried steak with garlic rice.) I am pretty particular about my eggs in that I prefer them to be cooked when I eat them. All too often I've ordered a fried egg and they arrive under cooked. While here, I asked for a fully cooked fried egg. The server suggested medium and added that the yoke would still be runny. That's fine with me if the yoke is runny, I'd just like the white parts to be fully cooked. Well, when I received my meal, the outside of the egg was cooked, the yoke was runny, but there was a significant part of the white part on the inside that was still raw. It was more like over easy. I don't like that at all and had requested that it be fully cooked. I don't personally find it difficult to fully cook an egg, even while keeping the yoke a bit runny. So this was a disappointment. The rest of the dish was fine, but not amazing. When scrambled, the eggs here seem fine, but I think a restaurant should offer well served eggs in all variations. Also the garlic rice, which was described as being garclicy with onions, tasted fairly bland. As far as the pancakes go, they have an incredible range of flavor choices, I loved having all those options. However, both times I have dined here, my experience with the pancakes did not exceed places like IHOP or Denny's in terms of fluffiness and flavor. (However IHOP's eggs do not even meet my basic requirements. In fact, my other wanted to go to IHOP this morning, but thinking about their eggs, I Yelped a bit and we settled on Babystacks.) Anyway, back to my review, I couldn't even finish the entire half stack of pancakes before feeling sick. And let me tell you, I am a sugar fiend. Waffles, pancakes and French toast with all the sugary sweet toppings are my jam. Unfortunately, I will probably not be returning here because my experiences have been consistently underwhelming. Please keep in mind, the service was great, and it seems that many people enjoy this place just fine. This is just my experience and I hope it is helpful one way or another."}
{"text":"To be honest I had no idea about how AWESOME of a place this cafe is. If you're a fan of AMAZING breakfast options I highly recommend you check this place out. I had the pleasure of coming here for a Book Club meet up. We are a group of Sci Fi/ Fantasy readers who are female food lovers. Our fearless leader set up this Brunch and let me tell you I was really impressed. Upon entering the parking lot the place didn't look too special but I could see lots of people waiting for a table. I was running late as USUAL so once I entered we had already been seated. Our  server Jacob was prompt at greeting me politely with a smile and asking what he could get me to drink while he went to grab me a menu.  I literally opened it up expecting to go with my normal go to breakfast choice when I was #MINDBLOWN. They have so many different options from Red Velvet Pancakes to these awesome fancy eggs benedict dishes. I had a really hard time deciding what to go with but I couldn't help but wanting  try the Fried Rice Stuffed Omelet. I however didn't trust myself to just impulsively go with my gut choice without asking Jacob what his thoughts were on the dish.  He smiled that bright smile and stated it was DELICIOUS and one of the most popular dishes. Let me tell you he was RIGHT!  about 3 of the 8 ladies went with the fancy eggs benedict varietes another got a crepe and some fruit. Since I didn't try any of them all I can say is EVERYONE had empty plates . My dish was super yummy but HUGE so I ended up bringing half of it home. I am terrible at remembering the names of items but I will say this place is priced around 10-15$ per entree but you get TONS of food and good quality taste and EXCEPTIONAL service. I was helped by Happy and Friendly people even when checking out and paying at the front. What impressed me the most though was they had no problem giving us seperate checks and at NO TIME were we rushed at all even while we were done eating and sitting there talking the afternoon away. I can't wait to return with my family to try out some more awesome dishes...If you're a breakfast person or even just a fan of delicious asian fushion give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place.. and I must say, I was not let down at all. 

I decided to try this place with a few of my girlfriends on a Sunday morning. I ordered the steak & eggs with hash browns and upgraded my original pancakes to the red velvet pancakes. Two of my friends got the red velvet pancakes as well. We absolutely loved them! They are soo delicious. They're the perfect combination of a bit of chocolatey flavor & cream cheese. They were also very fluffy and light, but the edges had a little crispiness to them which was good.

The hash browns and eggs were yummy as well. The steak, however, wasn't all that. It had a very charred taste to it. I ordered it medium rare and there was very little pink to it. It was also very tough and hard to chew. I could have done without the steak.

The ambiance of the place was nice. It was very clean. I don't think they turn on the A/C though, which I didn't mind much but my friends did. They had ceiling fans running but I guess with that many people in one place, it tends to get a little warm. 

We waited for about 20 minutes to get a table because it was so busy, this isn't a bad thing.. just shows how good this place is. Our server was very nice and friendly. 

I'm docking a star only because of the steak. I LOVE steak and I'm not even usually picky when it comes to it. But theirs just didn't cut it. Other than that, everything was amazing. 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice is too salty.  I get the Mexican omelet.  It's spicy and full of taste."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming of BabyStacks since I left Las Vegas.  Literally, I had a dream I was swimming in a pool of cream cheese sauce.

We came to Vegas for a weekend getaway and stumbled upon this place.  We liked it so much on Saturday that we returned for breakfast on Sunday.  I'm sure if I lived there I'd go every day of the week and be a huge, fat pancake eating machine.  It's probably best that I live six hours away.  

If you like orange, get the creamsicle pancakes.  The red velvet also won't disappoint.  My husband loved the fried rice wrapped in an egg (can't remember the name).

Until we meet again, BabyStacks..."}
{"text":"Great red velvet pancakes!!!! 

Seating is very tight though."}
{"text":"This place was great. My wife wanted to come here, and I was a little hesitant at first. We arrived and was seated right away. Staff was super friendly and got our drinks right away.  After ordering our food, it took like 5 minutes to get our food, and it wasn't like the place wasn't packed. 

Down side:
Won't seat you until your entire party is here. And won't split checks.  

Besides those things, it was enjoyable and will probably be back."}
{"text":"Typically I love Babystacks, but today was very lacking.

I was in the mood for something Hawaiian and breakfast at the same time, so they were the closest thing.

I'm a sucker for Portuguese Sausage and Eggs, which is what I ordered. I was taken aback when they don't allow for substitutes, so I ordered on the side kalua pig and cabbage... never felt so \"nickel and dimed\" when I saw the charge for kalua pig and the cabbage separated haha. I get it since I can sell sides and enhancements for dishes but wow.

Knowing what I know now, they sauteed the cabbage which when I poured over my rice, I definitely saw all the oil run off the plate. I was hungry so I didn't want to waste that almost $4 upcharge. So for future referrence, if I ever want to get my Portuguese Sausage fix, any Egg Works location at least provides a full link cut in half, not slices off of 1 link that looks like they are trying to stretch out. And to get my kalua pork fix I'll stick to ISG because for a couple dollars extra, I would get double the rice and about 3x the amount of Kalua pork with actual braised cabbage and not quickly sauteed on the flat top.

As for their pancakes, I've had better in their other locations. Even though I ordered the PB and ??? as my side for the breakfast instead of toast, it still came out very dense. Not their usual fluffy pancakes in the past.

Also, I didn't appreciate my server \"Nicole\" - I found her name on my ticket - giving me the check a couple bites in to the meal. Also didn't care for the pancakes coming out late. I would prefer to have everything served all at once. I get it if that's what their manager expects out of them, but by dropping the check, what I feared would happen did happen: She never checked on me again. I had to flag down the guy that was their busser who was polishing silverware in front of me to get me more water. She even came back from break and still didn't check on me afterwards.

And another thing,  I get not everyone is accostumed to foodies taking pictures of their food. But be more conscientious of your surroundings. You can laugh at them in the back service area, not in front where customers can see your busser and the male server with the very big afro style haircut snickering at the two ladies taking pictures of the food that was sitting next to me at the counter. Common sense not to do it where other guests can see you pointing and snickering at them. Do the polite thing and talk \"shite\" about guests where they are out of eye and earshot. Just like in the movie \"Waiting.\"

And yes,  I lied to my cashier when she asked me how everything went and I said okay. I didn't want to run the risk of being late and I for sure didn't want to bog her down with the points I just pointed out above."}
{"text":"First of all, always check your to go orders before you leave the place.  I placed a to go order and we were missing an order of pancakes.  Mac Pancakes were ok, nothing to come back for.  Adobo fried rice taste more like shoyu/soy sauce.  Maybe we'll stop by again to try something different, hopefully it'll be better."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Called twice this morning from two different phones and Erica states she is unable to hear anything... Ummmm from two different phones. Then when I called back the lines go straight to voicemail. Being that today is Father's Day is no excuse. This location is always busy, so please answer the phones in an area where the workers can hear clearly."}
{"text":"Awesome.  I had the Loco Moco with the garlic rice and it was like I was back on Oahu.  The pancakes are off the planet good as well.  Definitely recommend a trip off the Strip to this place!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I want a big sweet breakfast. Although the service is average due to that location being busy and next to Sunset Station Casino, the servers do their best to serve you quickly and in a polite manner.

I always order the \"Ricks Adobo Fried Rice\" and UPGRADE my Pancakes to \"Banana Fosters Pancakes\" VERY MOUTHWATERING AND DELICIOUS!!!

The restaurant itself is mediocre it is kind of a small area for people to get around when it's busy, and it does get a little bit loud. But it's a great place to eat good breakfast. Bring your family and friends here and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We were in town for a bit and heard about this great breakfast/brunch place. It's about a 10-15mins drive from the strip. We were immediately seated upon arrival. 

Everything on the menu looked really good, so it was hard to decide. Ultimately, I settled on the Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice with extra garlic and hash browns on the side. The garlic fried rice was made with shredded chicken in a tasty marinade. I was half expecting the chicken to be dry, but it was good and seasoned well. The rice was wrapped in an egg omelette. Our waiter was a little confused when I asked for extra garlic in the rice. It wasn't a difficult request but he had a hard time understanding me. My boyfriend got the Breakfast Burrito, which was really amazing. It had peppers, onions, cheddar cheese, your choice of meat, and red or green sauce. This also came with hash browns on the side. 

Sadly we had dinner reservations or I would have tried some of their pancakes. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in down!"}
{"text":"I would give it 10 stars if I could!! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place shortly after we moved to Vegas and now we have to come here at least 3-4 times a month. I love the ham, eggs, and garlic fried rice. Sounds a little weird, I know, but try it once and you'll be addicted.

I won't try and top what's already been written about the red velvet pancakes. They are heavenly, try them, 'nuff said.

Yes, there is almost always a wait for a table but hey, the best things are worth waiting for and so is Babystacks."}
{"text":"Any and every Babystacks location is amazing. All of the food tastes as great as it looks. And the servers are all kind no matter how crazy packed they get. I will ALWAYS recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I go to this place every time I visit Las Vegas!! I would say this place is known for more than a dozen options of specialty pancakes, adobo fried rice, and loco moco. I decided to mix things up and get the corn beef hash which turned out to be a mediocre meal. Remember to upgrade your meal to get the speciality pancakes for about $2 is totally worth it. Dont forget to upgrade to garlic rice if your meal doesn't include adobo fried rice. They have a great selection of specialty made pancakes but known for their red velvet pancakes. I'm a big chocolate fan so I'll try to get a chocolate based pancake. 


Fyi it's a breakfast place and they normally close at 2 pm!! They will not seat you until all of your party is present and will split credit cards checks."}
{"text":"Family atmosphere, A+ service, Hawaiian comfort food and slippa' friendly.  BabyStacks is a good place to sit back, enjoy a cup of coffee for luch and slam as many Red Velvet Pancakes in your mouth until you reach your limit!  All the rave about these heavenly cakes live up to its reviewers 4-5 star rating.  The Red Velvet Cakes were accompanied with cream chese syrup, choco chips and whip.  The other dishes we ordered on the menu were no comparison to IHOP and Denny's.  Eggs Benedict w Kaluhua Pig and Chicken Adobo Omelet just to name a couple.  The place is quite small and the wait can be quite long which is the only downside.  Otherwise.. Onolicious Brah!"}
{"text":"Went with of a group of ten we tried alot of different dishes. Country fried steak was really good. The strawberry pancakes (full stack) was more than my son could eat. now that is crazy! Every dish was awesome. they had Filipino dishes and other unique menu items. The strawberry syrup seemed to be most popular. A Must try breakfast stop when in Vegas. A bit out of the way I think in Summerlan but well worth it."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had!!! Must have! All of us had different ones and all of them were good! Red velvet, Ricky road and orange dreamsicle!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place blew my mind - an attraction off The Strip.  I'm typically not a pancake person, but I ate my whole shortstack and main plate.  Whoops.  So much flavor and deliciousness!  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place.... NOw that they opened a location on Buffalo/Flamingo.. the wait is soo much shorter.  The red velvet pancakes are da bomb... and i just love the pork adobo!!  I also tried the cinnamon pancakes which are really good too!  I have nothing bad to say about this place this all.  The food is GREAT."}
{"text":"Terrible gravy, eggs are no Bueno, this place needs to be cleaned and douched. Waiters are very forgetful. Probably won't be eating here anytime soon. Waitress was very nice. However, her hair was in her face. And they all look sloppy."}
{"text":"Awesome! I now eat here every week for breakfast.  This place is 25 mins from home and worth every minute of the drive.  I usually eat 2 breakfasts just so I can try everything! Portuguese Sliders! Super awesome! See you next week BabyStacks!"}
{"text":"When Babycakes Cafe first opened in October, we were invited to join the Husband's cousins in experiencing this new breakfast joint.  Unfortunately, we couldn't make it out that morning but heard raving reviews from them and soon after, it was blowing up on Yelp!  It's been on our radar since, and when a groupon for Babycakes showed up, we scooped up on this coupon!

Yesterday was the big day - most importantly, we wanted to avoid the weekend rush.  Reviews about an hour long wait weren't something we were interested in, and luckily, it was only a ten minute wait for our party of three on a Wednesday around noon.

We decided to share three items that were unique to Babycakes Cafe than other breakfast joints in town.

* Red Velvet Pancakes \"Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles.  Served with cream cheese syrup.\" (Full stack $7.95, Short stack $5.25) - First off, I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes and it's not my first choice in breakfast.  But hands down, these pancakes are REALLY good.  They aren't too fluffy or thick.  The sweetness is just perfection and sweetness from the cocoa, whipped cream, and syrup all add to this yummy cake.  I was sold and would definitely reorder this over and over again.  We went for the full stack to share, which was a very smart choice! 

* Kalua Pig Benedict \"A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, English muffin.  Topped with our delicious hollandaise sauce.\" ($9.75) - The Husband and Truc N. were loving this dish.  As Truc was saying, he doesn't really like pork all that much but he really enjoyed their version.  They both complimented on how moist the meat was and enjoyed the savoriness.  The accompanying potatoes could use a something something though. 

* Rick's Adobo Fried Rice \"A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.\" ($8.50) - This was the downfall of our breakfast.  It was a huge scrambled egg concoction with the fried rice mixture inside.  I was the first to split it open and there was a weird smell that came from it.  And then the taste, I wasn't quite getting it and wasn't sure if this was how it was supposed to taste.  When the Husband got into it, he ultimately said their burned it - the rice, the meat, just everything inside.  I'm still not sure if it was intentional to have the 'burnt' taste or not, but all of us were not impressed with it.  Not something we recommend.

Overall, they have some unique items that make them stand out - specifically the first two items we ordered and additional things like Honey French Toast, S'more Pancakes, Bacon Pancakes, seasonal items like Pumpkin Pancakes and Macadamia Nut Pancakes.

Service - it did take awhile for our food to come out.  And I can only imagine how much longer the wait may be on weekends after you get seated.  And yes, there is more than just the food here, the view is quite nice too for the men.  I don't recommend coming with a large group as it's a small restaurant and there isn't that much room for large groups."}
{"text":"I normally get the cookie butter French toast combo or red velvet pancakes with a byo omelette combo. 
But today, I switched my red velvet for the lemon ricotta. THE BEST CHOICE. 
Adding it onto my favorites list. 
Oh! Also tried the Boston cream pie pancakes, crazy good!
Great food, chill atmosphere, and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Post bikram yoga meal. 
And pre workout meal. 
I'm choosing this place to fuel my day. 
Love this spot!"}
{"text":"At this point I'm not going to make this a regular breakfast stop anymore. The food is tasty as always but the service is getting worse and worse every time. It took 10 minutes after getting our drinks to take our orders despite the waitress passing by our table five times. She brought my husband the wrong pancakes and despite asking for a refill earlier in the meal (which never showed up), later asked if my husband wanted a coffee refill AFTER we finished our food and it took forever to pay the bill because the people in front of us in line had a huge issue with their own bill. Still had to pay for the babystacks up charge despite her error and the poor service. I really hope the service changes for the better soon. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite when visiting Vegas. The food is so delicious that they close at 2:00 pm. Fast, courteous service   I call it Asian Fusion.  Two locations.  I've tried both and love both. Red velvet pancakes and adobo fried rice are what I ate today.  Or I should say that's what I order every time when eating here.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This was okay. Didn't want to cook so here we are. They have many choices of pancakes - the menu is vast. I'm not a pancake person but they had other stuff to choose from. My son orders the red velvet stacks and I had the Nutella crepes with strawberries. 
My son took a bite and I could tell he was just ok with it. It was quite dense as I had a bite too. Tasty but too thick on my opinion. He said it felt like he was eating a thick cake. 
When mine came, I already knew I couldn't finish it. I like my crepes light and thinner. This was thick too and I only managed to eat one and took home the rest. Maybe we are not pancake ppl but should it be so thick.
I do like the decor and how the restaurant is
Set up. To me that's the first thing I notice when I come in and the odor, which was fine. The food could be awesome but it will turn me away if it's not clean or inviting. It was busy which is also a good sign and no wait ."}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place YOU NEED TO. Lol it is hands down the best breakfast place in the city! They have awesome breakfast burritos, but my favorite is the red velvet pancakes!!!! Mmmmm so tasty, I'm craving them just writing this review!  I might just have to go again in the morning haha. But seriously I've been here so many times and never have had bad service or bad food. Everything is always on point!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are absolutely amazing and heavenly. I just found out I'm allergic to gluten so hopefully they have a gluten free version bc their pancakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good most of the time except for one guy, will need to get his name. The main things we don't like is the place is small and you are sitting so close to everybody/other tables. Also very loud but probably due to putting so many people in a small place and no barrier to speak of from the kitchen area."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancake is top notched. My niece loved her pancake with honey and chocolates. I forgot what it's called. The atmosphere is pleasing. We waited a little bit because it was really busy but the service is excellent. They serve garlic fried rice and adobo rice which is peculiar for a cafe (I'm guessing it's owned by Filipinos). Anyway, we'll come back again when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome pancakes... long wait... small waiting area. Awesome food so... i guess the wait doesn't matter."}
{"text":"The steak and eggs are so good, I order TWO of them. Red velvet pancakes of course. The workers are always nice and polite at every location I've been to. Hands down my favorite restaurant to eat at; Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day after a good workout."}
{"text":"5 stars for the wide selection and delicious pancakes!!! We ordered to go and loved every bite!!"}
{"text":"I love Babystacks. Pulled Kahlua Pork Loco Moco is Bomb. Service is pretty great for as busy as it always is. All the Specialty Pancajes are Amazing. For presentation reasons the toppings taste great and look good BUT... I want MORE. They only put Toppings on Top... I want them on every pancake."}
{"text":"Our morning would not be complete with this awesome meal. We did take out this morning .There was something for everyone on the menu. I had the Loco moco with a side of banana and peanut butter pancakes. The portions were perfect. The staff was very friendly and did their jobs with pure awesomeness! Thanks baby stacks! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"this place is alright not as good as the other locations.. the servers aren't too attentive, this place can be busy and crowded .. i ate here twice already and it hasn't change my mind to add another star since i did a pick up right before work .. they showed what i got and i said ok .. and while i got to work i found no utensils and syrup for my french toast i was pissed i mean i dont eat it plain .. i paid this much and i get crappy ass french toast!

i'm not that type of person who would let go i mean the stuff they got aint cheap .. i called, the lady on the phone wasn't that nice what kind of service they got coz the way she talk to me she has no class and i work for food and i handled people over the phone better ! she got me mad because she was like \"i cant do anything other than you come back for the syrup\" like wth is that .. you want me to waste my goddamn gas when im already at work .. she doesn't know how to take care customer concern when in the first place its her fault to put no syrups inside the bag and even utensils smh .. i gave one star coz i told her to give the phone to the manager atleast this lady apologize and gave me 20% off for next pick up purchase but idk if i am since the server doesn't know how to do there jobs .."}
{"text":"Best breakfast .. food are great .. this is one of the place I go to beside rise and shine .."}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast junkie so to get even an avg review it needs to be somewhere I'd try again.  First the pros, The velvet pancakes were heaven.  My wife ordered the chocholate chip pancakes which were simply buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips on top she was disdapointed.  Her pigglet skillet she enjoyed.  I ordered the country benedict.  Everything about my order was good unitl I cut the yolk of my poached eggs that looked like the eggs were hard boiled.  Still it was good.  The service was acceptable nothing that knocked our socks off but acceptable.  We may try this again if we visit vegas again but not this trip."}
{"text":"The food is always gonna be good at Baby Stacks! But what makes this place a 3 star is because of the employees. I get how busy it gets knowing that it's only open for breakfast and brunch, but it's not an excuse not to be greeted promptly and just get ignored for a long time even when you're already standing in front of the host.

Nonetheless, food is bomb. Always gonna get more. Maybe just at another branch though, not this specific baby stacks."}
{"text":"Seriously, i dont know if this is a family business but it sure feels like your at home. The food and service is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I have been taking my family about 2-3 times a month since it opened. We loved having breakfast here at first. As time went on we had more and more issues. First of all most of the staff is not very attentive. Don't expect for them to come check on you. You have to make several attempts to wave them down.  The last time I was there I had an empty coffee cup my whole meal then 2 people asked if I wanted a refill just as I was going to ask for the tab. The next thing is the cleanliness. Tables sticky, food under our seat, and something splattered on the wall next to us as we ate that you could see from across the restaurant.  The last thing that is getting worse is organization.  The only way to pay is at the front (common at many breakfast places).   The last few times they seem to wait till the whole waiting area fills with people before they send someone over to work the register. The last time I was there I waited so long I watched my table get cleaned, sat, and the food was coming out for them as I was paying. Part of the reason was a group of about 10 women were instructed to be rung up before me by an employee even though I was in line. they then asked for their check to be split into individual checks. When I finally got to the counter to pay I asked if he was aware that I had been waiting to pay he said \"I know you waited a long time and shrugged. paid and then asked to speak to a manager. To my surprise the manager was the man that instructed the group to cut me. The food is good, but it's not worth it because of the cleanliness and the staff. Looking forward to hash house a go go opening across the street."}
{"text":"Okay. Guys. GUYS.

This is literally the best breakfast I've ever had IN MY LIFE.

It was so good that I am going back weeks later to review it, because it was seriously THAT AMAZING.

ZOMGGGGG ALL CAPS BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO VEGAS AND DON'T GO THEN YOUR LIFE WILL BE WORSE AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW.

All right, so the food. I am a huge eggs benedict fan, so after reading the great reviews, I went with the kalua pork eggs benedict. Wow!!! It certainly did not disappoint. Smoky and savory and melt-in-your-mouth tender - mind-blowing. I was torn between wanting to savor it slowly and wanting to shove it all in mah belly at once. My boyfriend had the adobo fried rice, and the second he took the first bite, he had to close his eyes just to take it all in. I tried it too, and I don't even like rice, but I almost wanted to trade mine for his. Almost.

But, the best part of the meal was the pancakes.

We shared an order of Butterfinger pancakes. Let me repeat - BUTTERFINGER freaking PANCAKES. The lady asked if we wanted them made with peanut butter batter and we said yes... best decision ever. They came warm and awesome with candy shavings and a huge scoop of really thick and amazing whipped cream. I'm telling you guys, the noises we were making while eating were downright indecent. 

I wish I could paint you all a better picture of just how incredible this food was. Mostly I just want everyone to go there so they can get lots and lots of business and expand to SoCal, because I have been craving it ever since. Yes, it's off the strip. Get over it. It's beyond worth it.

If I were to take off stars, it would basically be because no breakfast can compare and now that I know food this good exists I will forever be a spoiled brat saying, \"Well, it's good, but it's no BabyStacks...\"

Thanks a lot for ruining my palette for life with your deliciousness."}
{"text":"We had the Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice, loco moco , short stack of banana cream pie pancakes, cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice. Our total came up to be about 23.00. The place is small and cramp but clean and so are the bathrooms. We came in at 0800 on a Friday and was seated immediately. Servers were friendly, checked on us often and our food came out quick and hot. 
The food.... Rob says his Portuguese sausage eggs and rice was throwback to what we were used to eating in Guam and his orange juice tasted like the canned ones  we were served in school. 
Mine was the loco moco, they used a darker gravy than what I'm used too but I did like it a lot. I'm glad they don't use cheap rice here which takes away from the dish like the other island restaurants here do. I don't know which they use but it was not heavy and thick. I got through two of the patties and was stuffed,only got to eat a quarter of my pancakes which is a shame since they were soooo good."}
{"text":"Fancy pancakes for cheap. Had the banana cream pie pancakes really good not as sweet as it sounds. $6.00 for the short stack. Tried the carrot cake pancake and the adobo friend rice omelet all good. It's busy and cramped."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE; I  LEFT.
When I arrived I had to wait while cashier took care of 3 customers bills at check out. They have no one to seat a potential paying customer. They just let u stand there until cashier is done & then, she'll seat u. 
Then, once seated, I sat there drinking my coffee & was ready to order; however,   3 different employees came by & told me \" your server will be here in a minute\" as I continued  to wait & waIt while waitress gave refills to customers seated next to me, eating, & ignored me.
I got so fed up, I got up & paid for my coffee ($2.70) & left. WILL NEVER BE BACK.  This is no way to do business. Have enough help to wait on customers. 
And, probably, sever would have been highly offended if I had ordered & left without tipping. 
Vegas is a tipping town.  But ONLY if give Good service!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the restaurants we were looking forward to when we moved back to North Las Vegas. Great breakfast and lunch options, and Hawaiian plates. It's nice to have steamed white rice available to switch up with their potato options. The array of pancake options from smores to red velvet to banana fosters makes it impossible to choose your favorite because they're all delicious! Also the servers are excellent, they are patient with our kids and always check back on you so your drinks are top off and you're not left chasing for service. I do know this is a physical constraint with the size of the overall place, but think wisely when you're going there during a breakfast rush. The front of house always quotes an extremely long wait time, but due to the in and out, high traffic, you never know if it's actually going to be 10 minutes or longer. Also the seating is not comfortable during the rush as the tabletops are small and limited seating."}
{"text":"Great place, right when you walk in you can smell the fresh aroma of pancakes! I had the adobo omelette and chocolate chip pancake, it was outstanding. My mouth is salivating right now just thinking about it. Great service and great staff."}
{"text":"With so many locals from Hawaii living in Henderson, it's so awesome to have this place open it's doors today.  Loved hearing Hawaiian music flow through the restaurant.  My husband and I ordered the Kalua pig benedict, red velvet pancakes and loco moco. Our waiter gave us the option of how we wanted our eggs cooked, which was different.. I thought a loco moco had sunny side up eggs but a little variety is cool.. And aren't eggs Benedict poached eggs?  I guess it would be cool if they were scrambled. Maybe. Anyway, both dishes where awesome. The red velvet pancakes and cream cheese syrup weren't too sweet so I actually enjoyed them. Next time, I'm definitely gonna hit up the Zippys Chili plate!

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they weren't all that ready for their first day. They only accepted cash today because their Debit/credit card  system wasn't up and running yet. It's a good thing I had some cash. I'll definitely be back so maybe then, I'll update the review to 5 stars. :)"}
{"text":"The only not 5 Star thing about our visit was when I asked the waitress if they had anything Gluten Free, she said, and I quite \"The closest we would have is the All Wheat French Toast\".  @__@. Crickets.
 I had the Banana Fosters Crepes, they were perfect, with sweet syrup and the non-sweet crepes, complimenting each other perfectly. I asked if the bacon is crisp, she asked
If I wanted it crisp and I explained crisp but not hard. It was perfection.
 My GF The Locals Favorite, a burrito with Mojo. It was To Die For. Capitals firmly needed for this. When we go back next week I think we're all getting it, even my sweet food loving daughter.
 Said daughter got the Macadamia Nut Pancakes. We both added cream Cheese Syrup, and barely used it cause everything was perfect.
 My Mom got the Red Velvet Pancakes and ate so much that our chickens were depressed at the
lack of leftovers. 
 We arrived at nine and had a five minute wait, we heard the hostess telling people 20 minutes at one
point, so we'll be there at 8:27, our usual meeting time next week.
 Parking was ample, and the coffee was good, never empty.
 Paul H had given this place decent reviews, and Yelping about it discovered we both were Biscuits lovers, this place doesn't have the love you feel of Biscuits, however it may win out in the end!"}
{"text":"Update: they don't care that it's uncomfortably cold. They say it gets too hot later. Bummer, we liked it here. Very strange that all the Not Recommended reviews are one and two stars. Usually I can see why, but not this time.

If they weren't so small they may not have the rule of not seating until your whole party is there. I knocked off a star for that.
 The crepes are delicious. They have made me a Nutella fan. I have fought for years against it. Then I tried it with strawberries, and then bananas. Both set it off nicely.
 The rest of the menu is varied with some specialty dishes I've never seen. Everyone raves about them, I've had some bites. They are very good, but I'd have to give up a crepe for them, so a bite or two do me just fine.
 If you get there before nine there's no wait. After nine you will wait 15 to 20 min.
 The waitresses are ok, nothing to scream about. They keep the tasty hood coffee coming, sometimes after a wait of 5 min or so. To me that's unacceptable. So another star gone.
 That being said we've been there every Sunday for almost three months. Lol"}
{"text":"I'm not normally a breakfast person, but Babystacks definitely turned me! I had the chicken adobo omelette, which might sound weird to some, but it was far from it! Slap a little sriracha and ketchup on it, and it is even more perfection! Also, try the khalua pork eggs benedict, which are amazing. The real star here though are those red velvet pancakes... they are perfectly balanced between pan and cake. So moist and decadent but also light and airy. That cream cheese syrup sauce they come with is like crack! Too good to not eat the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast..love all there pancakes. Most try the oreo cookies and cream pancakes. Very fast and lovely service..this is a most stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes- DIVINE!
Friendly staff, a little \"cozy\", and huge portions.

Tried the biscuits and gravy (not something I'm able to get much of in HI) and we also tried the omelet and red velvet pancakes. The winner was definitely the pancakes!

Try the red velvet pancakes if nothing else. And I'm a red velvet skeptic..."}
{"text":"Went to Babystacks the other day for the first time.  I had family in town and they were in the mood for pancakes so we gave it a shot.  The wait time wasn't long, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was done right.  I liked the menu options for pancakes especially, and ended up going with some Nutella/whipped cream concoction; which was very good.  

The only thing deterring me from giving 5 stars was the lack of options of what to have with my pancakes.  I was really hoping for a milkshake or cappuccino, but the only coffee option was coffee and cream."}
{"text":"Good but not sure it's worth all the hype.  Went there with a fairly large group of friends and had to wait a pretty long time to be seated.  It's a small place and right now very trendy so be prepared to wait.

I found their red velvet pancakes a but too sweet and definitely overrated.  I love red velvet but when you add in the chocolate chips and their icing it was just too sweet.  It was better without all the other stuff but then slightly dry.

Liked their buttermilk pancakes more.  Nice and moist and delicious with the butter and syrup.

Believe I also got corned beef hash - it was very good but the potatoes with it were meh."}
{"text":"First time at the blue diamond location. Very disappointed in the service. I've been in the restaurant industry for 27 years as a server. The server (Edgar) had no personality and was not friendly at all. He was basically a order taker. Dropped off our plates and walked away. He didn't ask if we needed anything else and he never checked back to see if our food was ok. We also had to ask for our check, which we had to wait for. I will not return and I will spread the word about the terrible service to all my colleagues in the industry."}
{"text":"Jessie B and I wanted to grab some brunch last weekend. When she said she had never been to Babystacks I knew it would be a perfect fit. 

Since it was a Saturday there was about a 25 minute wait, but I knew it would be worth it. When they called our name we were quickly seated. Our waitress was very on point. She never let our coffee or water glasses get empty. Babystacks menu has tons of different pancakes that they offer, but make sure you check out their white board for their daily specials. I finally decided on the Spinach Benedict with a side of their macaroni salad and Jessie picked off the white board and got the Strawberry Lemonade pancakes with a side of turkey sausage. The Spinach Benedict was excellent! It was loaded with spinach, crispy bacon, mushrooms, poached eggs and it was all covered it the best tangy hollandaise sauce I think I've ever had. It had a lemony note that was perfect. Jessie was nice enough to let me try her pancakes too. Let me tell you I'm really not a pancake person and those pancakes rocked! What a great flavor! Lemon pancakes covered in strawberries and it had a lemon syrup too!! ALL the lemon. 

It was another great brunch with Jessie B. Babystacks didn't disappoint. The wait sucked, but for the amazing food and excellent service it was worth it. If your looking for a tasty breakfast/ brunch spot this is the place! Yum!"}
{"text":"Those pancakes are so good. I also had the Zesty Chicken skillet, that was also tasty. Glad we ventured off the strip to explore all that Vegas has to offer. Will definitely make sure we eat more here on our next visit."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Ordered the huevos rancheros and it was very tasty.  

Oh man the pancake selection was tough to choose! I decided on the red velvet because it got such great reviews. They were delicious!!! Definitely a fantastic place to eat! Next time I'm in Vegas will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great place to have hawaiian style food.  We wanted to eat at a breakfast place that served hawaiian food and we were not disappointed.  We weren't from Vegas but found that it was a very popular place to eat by the amount of people waiting to get in.  Service was great and the menu had a variety of different hawaiian and american breakfast plates.  Will visit that restaurant every time we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love that this place is so close to my house. Ive never had to wait long for a table. I stick to the same thing Everytime. My sister and I share the Huntington omelet and the red velvet pancakes. Service is fast and good can't go wrong if you stick to the popular dishes! They are popular for a reason:)"}
{"text":"I'm still angry at my best buddy, who lives/lived in Vegas, for not taking me here sooner.  HOLY COW.  SO DELICIOUS.  I cry when I think of the red velvet pancakes.  I cry even more when thinking of the kalua pig omelette.  

We went for brunch on Friday at around 11:30 AM.  There were a group of 6 before us but other than that, not much of a wait.  We got our seats within 10 minutes.  Love that they had Hawaii-an food selection.  i ordered the kalua pig omelette while one bff got a crepe and the other bff (who i'm mad at), got the red velvet panackes. 

The crepe, was just a crepe.  But the pancakes were warm and delicious and so much like a red velvet cupcake.  A perfect accompaniment to my slightly salty kalua pig.

The kalua pig was perfectly salted and made me miss home just a bit.  The portion was generous; if I were going home after brunch, I'd save some to eat for later.  But I wasn't so I went ahead and ate most of it.  My crepe-bff ate what I couldn't finish.

I can't wait to come back to Vegas for this place!  Slots/gambling/clubbing, I'm not such a huge fan.  But this place, is worth flying back for."}
{"text":"Back at it again Jacob!!! Mr. Hawaiian Franco!!! As long as your here I'll bring my service here. Oh the food is great too!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to eat for 3. They refused to seat us because we were still waiting for my 3rd friend. They literally had many tables available for us. So instead of seating us and allowing to enjoy a cup of coffee while we wait, they needed us to wait for our 3rd person. It's not like we were a party of 8! That didn't sit well with me. It's simple easy customer service that wouldn't have caused any issues on their end to sit up. But because of their \"policy\" they've earned this 1 Star."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. Spam and Eggs! That's the best meal from my childhood that I still eat today. Me and my 10 yr old son devoured our plates. Perfect fry on the spam with just a slight crunch and the eggs were scrambled just right. My daughters white chocolate chip macadamia pancakes were heavenly as she said. This is highly recommended if your in the area. Must go again"}
{"text":"Um, yes.

In a town full of overrated casual breakfast joints, this one is the real deal."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times with husband.  The pancakes are good and they have a really large variety of pancakes available.  It was really busy there but we were seated promptly and served quickly."}
{"text":"Holy sh*t! This is my new favorite go to spot whenever I go to Las Vegas now!

Hawaiian, and Filipino cuisine. Extremely good comfort food. I got the banana foster pancakes, loco moco with Kalua pork and garlic rice.

Very extensive menu of pancakes and brunch style food. Good for a night of drunken adventures (for sure hungover when I ate here, and it GAVE ME LIFE)!"}
{"text":"Service was more than excellent. 
Very thoughtful and pleasant. 
Small place wait at lunch hour was about 20 mins. 
WORTH EVERY MINUTE. 
PANCAKES fluffy inside and chewy outside. Perfect. 
Portuguese sausage and eggs to die for. 
Chilli Moco upgraded to garlic rice the rave. 
Spam and eggs with rice was outstanding. 
Kids and adults really loved the peanut butter choc chip banana pancakes the very best they ever had. 
Fresh Strawberry lemonade not too tart not too sweet best ever. TOPS FOR POPS. 5 stars only because there wasn't a 6."}
{"text":"Discovered this hidden gem while visiting my sister in Vegas. We went here for our post-Thanksgiving breakfast and it was a perfect fusion of American-Hawaiian-Filipino! Spam and eggs over garlic fried rice was awesome. GO ALREADY!!"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite and a couple shots of insulin.   Babystacks serves up delicious albeit high calorie pancakes.    Take your pick from Banna's Foster , chocolate s'more, or the one the are known for - Red Velvet.     I got a large stack of those...whew !  too much.   It was like eating a big plate of candy bars.   Tasty but too much.

They have all the other regular breakfast staples including some nice benedicts.    All in all they do a good job."}
{"text":"This place is not too bad and the wait was pretty light. It is so hard to find a decent place to eat breakfast at on a Saturday or Sunday that does not either cost an arm and a leg, or does not have a hour plus wait. We have been to many. Babystacks is a good place to eat without much of a wait. Their prices are pretty reasonable considering you are getting a much more reasonable proportion of food. A lot of the breakfast places in the area have MASSIVE (like plate sized pancakes), baby stacks serves small and more reasonable pancakes that are equally good and much less money. This was the first time we can here and it was good, so was the service. My kids enjoyed their chocolate chip pancakes, and my wife (who isn't a huge breakfast fan (crazy I know!)) got their grilled cheese. I had their pancake breakfast with eggs, hasbrowns and sausage. All of it was good, manageable proportions, and came out quickly. I highly recommend a visit here. We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place. 4 of use went in hungry and came out stuffed. Great food excellent price."}
{"text":"This place is always busy when I come but customer service is always great. I got the hazelnut pancakes for the first time and it wasn't that great, it was a struggle to swallow my food because it was very dry. Maybe the batter wasn't made correctly but everything else tasted amazing as always."}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying that I LOVE the food at this restaurant, but the last time I was here, it made me rethink ever coming back again.  That makes me SOOO disappointed, because they have a great restaurant, but some of their staff is ruining it for customers  :(

****ASK FOR ANOTHER WAITRESS if you get \"FELICIA\" (Phyllicia)****

I was beyond frustrated with that waitress' attitude when she put her friends (2 people she knows) ahead of  ***SIX***  groups of people who were patiently waiting for the next available table.  It was appalling that when I asked a male waiter why she let them cut in front of everyone, both him and Felicia (Phylicia) **LAUGHED** and did not take the customers' concern seriously.

I was polite when I asked about the situation, but their attitude back towards me was rather rude.  Finally (after much debate), she told her friends they had to leave (since they clearly were skipping the line ahead of all those people waiting and they didn't even have a reservation).  However, she continued to give mean looks to myself and other customers who complained to her about this unfair situation, while we were finally seated and eating our meal.  Very poor service.

So again.... do yourself a favor... if Felicia (Phyllicia) is still working there, then ask for another waitress.  She is absolutely rude to customers and it's not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"My wife, sister and friend stopped for breakfast. Everyone enjoyed their meals and some of us had a few complaints. My friend ordered Nutella pancakes and a side of spam. Her pancakes seemed a bit dry for her, the spam was delicious. My sister had banana pancakes, which she loved. My wife had wheat French toast and she liked but not loved. I had a BYOWN skillet, scrambled eggs, peppers, mushrooms and potatoes with a side of red velvet pancakes. I wish my food was a bit warmer and I also thought the pancakes where sort of dry."}
{"text":"Man, I love Babystacks! The Summerlin location was created such a great vibe, I was really putting some big expectations on this new location. The best part: it's literally a mile away from my house! That's a score!

Just like the first location, this location is busy! On the weekends (and probably the weekdays as well) be prepared to wait! My wait wasn't bad though, just 30 minutes. There's a hostess station with some seating and lots of standing room outside. When you enter the restaurant, you'll notice lots of table top seating and some booth seating. There's big tvs for the game and some bar top seating as well. The service was awesome. Our server was such a sweet lady. She greeted us within 2 minutes and kept checking back with us. We actually got our food before the guests that sat 5 minutes before we did! Now that's efficient :)

For brunch, I got the Spam Scramble for $7.95. Three scrambled eggs with diced spam, sprinkled with furikake and a garlic rice upgrade for $1.00 more. The garlic rice was cooked with furikake, oil, garlic and onions. The flavors were awesome! I love spam and love the saltiness of it, complimenting the eggs very nicely. The rice was on point, just as I remembered. The ONLY problem with this plate was the portion. OMG, it was sooo small! It took up only 75% of the plate. I ate everything within 2 bites. I definitely think they have bigger portions in the Summerlin location. For my side, I decided to upgrade with a babystack of Red Velvet. Red velvet pancakes, topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles, served with cream cheese syrup. OH-EM-GEE, just has I remembered! The cakes were moist and so flavorful, the cream cheese really made the red velvet pop out and the chocolate crumbles accented the dish very well. DEFINITELY A MUST TRY!

I'm so glad this place opened by my place. I can literally come here every weekend without wasting a lot of gas. The next time I come, though, I hope they address this portion issue. Whether or not, I'm still coming back...time and time again!"}
{"text":"I have never heard soo many great reviews as I have heard about this place.  When I got a text from my friend last night before that they were going to Babystacks for brunch, I jumped on the moment to tag along.  Boy am I glad I did!

***Please be advised that you may have to wait a while before you get a table.  The hostess advised me that it could be upwards of up to 45 minutes.  We ended up waiting a little over 30 minutes.

Speaking of the hostess, I would like to share the only reason why this place got 4 stars for me.  This morning, there was a young girl in the front, taking everyone's name for the list.  She was definitely not as pleasant as I hoped for.  Maybe it just wasn't her day.  She showed a lot of irritation and no patience for anyone in front of her.  When it was time to pay, I noticed a jar that said, \"Tip for hostess,\" and realized why there was only a SINGLE dollar in there...

Ok, I'm done with my negative rant.  I want to talk about the AH-MAZE-ING food known as Babystacks!  Here's what me and my friends got:

Spam and Eggs for $8.25- It came with 3 slices of fried spam, eggs the way you like it (I got it scrambled) and either potatoes, hash browns, garlic rice for an extra charge and pancakes (any kinds of specialty pancakes for an up charge as well).  I chose the garlic rice and the bacon pancakes to get a versatile meal.  The rice was regular white rice with some kind of garlic infused oil drizzle over it with onions.  The only suggestion we had was maybe having caramelized onions in the future, but the rice was good.  The eggs were eggs and so was the spam.  Here's where this dish blows your minds...WHEN YOU COMBINED THOSE FLAVORS IN ONE BITE! That combination in one bite just made this dish worth it for me.  The pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with strips of bacon in the batter.  I really love eating breakfast meat with maple syrup so having that bacon in the pancakes made it AMAZEBALLS for me!!

Kalua Pig Benedict for $9.75- Now this is the dish that will keep me coming back!!  Let's start with the most flavorful seasoned potatoes cut into small cubes.  Then my friends, then there's the main attraction!  Toasted English Muffin, layered with a smoked Kalua (shredded) pig with cabbage, a medium poached egg and topped with hollandaise sauce.  I can't tell you how AH-MAZE-ING this dish is.  You'll just have to try it yourself.  Just know that the pork is super juicy and smokey, the English muffin is toasted by still soft, the egg is perfectly poached and the hollandaise is...well, let's just say that I'm going to dream about that sauce for months to come.

My friend had the short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes for $5.75- Start with 3 red velvet pancakes, topped with chocolate chunks and whipped cream and served with a cream cheese syrup.  I had the opportunity to try this and boy was it good!!  Super moist, super flavorful and such a great concept/reality!  I will be ordering a full stack the next time.

My other friend got the Portuguese sausage and eggs for $8.95- He had his eggs over easy, got the hashbrowns and chose the banana cream pie pancakes for an extra charge.  The Portuguese sausage is very familiar to me, being from Hawaii and it looked like the eggs were perfectly cooked.  Although I didn't try his meal, I know he was very satisfied by it, especially the banana cream pie pancakes.  His pancakes had bananas in the batter and as a topping.  These pancakes also came with sliced almonds, whipped cream, crushed pie crust and drizzled with a banana cream sauce.  

The place is small.  Super small.  There's a t.v. in the joint, contains bar top seating and a couple of butterflies as it's decor.  I'd consider this place a contender for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The food is that good!  If it wasn't for the hostess with the bad impression, this place would have gotten a 5 star.  Mark my words though.  The food itself will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have been here and it was a very pleasant experience from beginning to end. There were so many good choices my wife and I were not sure what to get but we had a lot of suggestions from family and friends that have been here before. I had the corned beef hash and my wife had the Adobo fried rice we were both happy with our food and it did remind us of our favorite spot back in Hawaii. I will definitely recommend this place to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I will keep short and simple....THE BEST LAS VEGAS BREAKFAST RESTAURANTE.  The best food and top notch for service 
Alway brings a smile to our faces when we step in"}
{"text":"Awesome out of the way breakfast at babystacks. Had Kailua pork eggs Benedict.  Almost too yummy."}
{"text":"Never dissapoints ! I love it here, very family friendly, and amazing staff. :)"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad food experience here! The lemon ricotta pancakes and garlic (very garlic!) rice are both to die for. 

The service is fine. It's always incredibly busy in the morning, and many servers are less then attentive (even when it isn't busy). I have ordered out, which works exactly how it should. 

Overall, I great place to dine. However, if you are impatient about waiting for your table or your server, try another place."}
{"text":"I've been a few times with the BF since my initial review and it's slowly crept up into a favorite breakfast spot for us. 

Firstly, I'm a Filipino so any place that has steamed or garlic rice is cool by my standards. This is a cool inbetween middle of Hawaiian breakfast and American style breakfast that is similar to what we would have at home. It's the varied options that bumps this place for us. I cannot eat pancakes alone for breakfast as it just is too much, too sweet, so it never seems worth it for us to get a full order at many places and they don't do short stacks of flavored ones. Here, many of the breakfast come with a option of a \"babystack\" (2 pancakes) and you can upgrade it to the many gourmet flavors for just $1.50 more. That amount with a savory breakfast seems perfect and costwise is great to get breakfast AND the flavored pancakes for under $10. Most places we would have to basically order pancakes as our third entree plate and that's usually too much to eat without others sharing.

I tend to favor their omelettes, as they are pretty fluffy and a good size or I let my Filipino all hang out and get a simple breakfast eggs and sausage type plate with rice.

Our go-to pancake flavor is the lemon ricotta. This one is a bit more crepe or german pancake like and is just very light in flavor. Lemon flavored sweets is a new thing for me, and this place definitely has helped convert me We normally get another rich flavor to contrast. However, the chocolately type pancakes here are not overly saccharine and dense. We had a almond joy flavor recently off their specials and it was fluffy, and just deliciously balanced. Nothing richly sweet like the chocolate bars. Chocolate pancakes is one of my least favorite kinds, but theirs is highly enjoyable for me. I've had their famous red velvet before, and honestly, every other flavor I've had surpassed that one so don't be afraid to delve out of the box. 

Service has been pretty decent of a range of acceptable to great. It's always at least friendly consistently. We go during the afternoon mostly, so it's never been a wait but is busy. I'm not sure if this place is packed with a waiting during usual breakfast hours on weekends, but I imagine so. If you don't like waits, well breakfast at breakfast time is maybe not a good thing to do.

I have yet to try some of the specialties like the kahlua benedict, but mostly because I have trouble thinking about coming here and not getting a pancake. They sound great though that it just might be worth it! In fact, I think I may go this weekend again. I've been on a big breakfast kick lately since we've been waking up early."}
{"text":"The wait was plain ridiculous at the original location so we decided to go to this secondary location where I called ahead and there was no wait and close to other errands we were doing. I don't like this temporary new earlier schedule of ours. Having breakfast at breakfast time really sucks with the wait times and dampens the mood.

We had zippys chili omelette on the specials white board. It's pretty decent and a bit different. I never really thought about chili on eggs, but it makes sense. 

I did a make your own skillet - potatoes with your choice of toppings (1 meat, 2 veggies, 1 cheese) and you can add additional toppings to the base price. I did carnitas, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese and asked for green sauce on the side. It was decent, but different from most skillets that seem cooked together, this is more thrown on top and put in the broiler to melt the cheese. 

We got our babystacks that come with our breakfast upgraded to their two new flavors on the white board. We did butterfinger which was rather nice and the butter finger pieces slightly melted were more peanutty in flavor and some parts crunchy. The creamsicle was decent, but I don't know if I'm just not a fan of orange flavored baked goods. 

Service was alright. It took a while for someone to come see us and order but once we did food came out pretty quickly . Server and host were both friendly. 

Yep. Same consistency of food as the original which is good. Sometimes it doesn't happen that way with new locations. Same food with possibly less of a wait!"}
{"text":"I used to be a french toast girl, and then suddenly this affinity for pancakes showed up.  While in Vegas, we noticed a common theme, all of our best meals were off the strip, and Babystacks was not an exception.  The touristy thing would have been to stay on the strip for breakfast, but after seeing all of the pictures of red velvet pancakes, i couldn't resist.  I applaud Babystacks for providing a half and full stack option, there is nothing worse than feeling full and sad for wasting all of that food.  I ordered the half stack and i love how they embodied the essence of  red velvet cake.  They could have been lazy and served the pancakes with maple syrup, instead they came up with a genius way of incorporating the cream cheese element into a sauce.  When it arrived to the table i was unsure of the look of the sauce, but after tasting it, it was delicious, a wonderful accompaniment to the lightest pancakes. I also ordered a side of turkey bacon at it was fab.  
Overall, Babystacks is a very humble restaurant serving dynamite food, and i look forward to coming back and trying more pancakes on my next visit."}
{"text":"Looking for a good place to eat with the girlfriend, we decided to check out babystacks, because of its close proximity and because we were really craving breakfast food. When we arrived the wait was short(a good sign), but the food wasn't that pleasing. First off, I got a spinach Benedict. The egg was way over cooked and not poached like it should've been. Not on one but TWO of the English muffins. I was okay with just avoiding eating it yet my girlfriend looked discouraged as well. She got the loco moco but there was hardly and I mean HARDLY, any rice to accompany the beef sausage. They charged us for a simple thing (tea), which at most places I go to are complimentary. Last, our waiter was late in getting our check and so while we waited I overheard our waiter as well talking to the other customers about how the chef \"almost cut off his finger\" and that there's blood everywhere and they're trying to get the situation under control. I thought that was pretty unprofessional."}
{"text":"We seem to be the breakfast neighborhood as we have plenty of breakfast/brunch options within a 5 mile radius. This is one of the newest in the neighborhood and the 3rd location for Babystacks. 

I got the adobo fried rice omelette- The adobo had good flavor and the omelette was fluffy and cooked right. You get a choice of side (mac salad, potatoes, pancakes) and I chose the macaroni which was fairly standard and decent. 

Lemon ricotta pancakes- this I think is my favorite on their regular pancake menu. Its a bit different since these are thin pancakes, like German style pancakes. I like it because its a good amount of sweet and the light tang from a squeeze of fresh lemon on it is nice. If you like those Dutch Babys this is the pancake cousin. 

Service was decent enough, but nothing standout. We had our drinks refilled and were checked on. 

 I hope that the quality of the food stays at this one as I feel the original location has slipped a bit in my last 3 visits. I'm glad to have another option in our hood."}
{"text":"We will not be coming back here for a long time.

The seating time can take up to 15 mins for 2 people, longer if they are having a super busy day, which is not bad at all. We opted for the counter yesterday, in order to get seated faster. Even though a lot of tables were open, there was a lot of people waiting. 

There was NO reason to get seated quickly. The food took about 45 to an hour to come out. Everytime I asked the waiter what was going on and where the food was, all he could say was \"It's coming\". When we were about ready to leave, I asked again \"Can you please tell me what is going on and it's coming?\" The waiter said he would go check, rather than coming back out and answering me, he hid in the kitchen for 10 mins and then finally brought SOME of our food out. By the time we got all of our food, parts of the order were wrong, waiter said he would get what I asked for & never brought it out.

Now, I overheard an excuse one of the waiters gave another table and it was \"Our regular chef isn't here.\" I do not feel that to be an appropriate excuse. There should always be back up&back up should be able to do their job too.

Let me say this, the food was still good and our meals were comped. BUT good food and horrible service with a side of comped meals.. is not enough to make a great experience like food should always be. I would rather pay and leave happy."}
{"text":"Easy access off the freeway so we thought we give them a try. There was alot of people waiting but since there was only 2 if us tgey were able to seat us right away.

The menu had so many things to choose from  hubby ordered homemade cornbeef has and eggs and I ordered an omlette. The coffee service was on point and our server was a little doll. We were very happy with both service and food.

If you are in the area I would check them out. I know if we are in tiwn we will be going back. I want to try some of thise amazing looking pancakes I seen."}
{"text":"Babystacks is an awesome breakfast/brunch option if you're on the NW side of town.  They have a huge variety of pancake choices.  Many of them super unique and all of them delicious.  I've had the carrot cake (tastes like carrot cake), banana cream (definitely my favorite!), orange creamsicle (super orangey tasting), and the cookies and cream (tastes like it sounds!).  

I appreciate that they have Hawaiian/Filipino breakfast choices too.  Not every place has spam or my fav, the adobo fried rice.  The adobo fried rice, which is basically an omelet, is reallllly good here - super packed with lots of meat and its even better when you upgrade to the garlic fried rice.  

My only qualm about this place is that service is not exactly top notch.  Servers are friendly enough, but not very attentive.  We've gone where service was soooooo sloooooow and we've gone when service was a normal speed.  Both times the place wasn't terribly crowded.  That part can be pretty hit or miss I guess.  

Either way, the food is great so give it a try and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 3 - This location is clean, cute, and pretty busy. But I feel like it's just too small for the amount of people it serves on a daily basis. Even waiting in the front area, it just feels like there's not enough space for everyone to walk through--especially since where you pay is also where you wait.

SERVICE: 4 - Our server was really friendly and helpful. He was fast and didn't want us to rush with eating, even though there were quite a few waiting people. He made us feel comfortable. The food we ordered also came really fast, which was a really nice change from regular waiting times. 

FOOD: 3 - Kahlua Pig Benedict: I usually really like Eggs Benedict, so I was really excited about trying one with pulled pork inside. I wasn't that impressed though with this one. I thought that the flavors were missing from my plate and I felt like they forgot to add an ingredient in. 

Garlic Fried Rice: I wasn't a fan of the garlic fried rice. It just felt wet, too oily, and the garlic was almost too subtle so that it just tasted like regular rice. It was a pretty big disappointment since people rave about it so much! For me, it just tasted like rice. 

**Red Velvet Pancakes (a must try!): The red velvet pancakes and cream cheese syrup that they make at this location are super good. The pancakes are warm and yummy. The way I eat them is I cut the pancake into pieces and dip them in the sauce..because pouring the sauce on does not cover enough of the pancake for me! 

It's a pretty sugary breakfast, but damn. It is so good. 

Their pancakes are the best, so I'll definitely be coming back to try the other flavors to get my morning sugar high on!"}
{"text":"This Babystacks location is really good for a private breakfast or one-on-one talk in the morning because not a ton of people really go here! Probably because it's just way too far from everyone else! Inside, it was clean, warm&inviting. There was really chill music playing; the atmosphere just gets you in a mood to relax. 

Customer service wasn't bad for us, there was no one in there and they sat us down right away and gave us menus. They were a little bit slow walking around, but it wasn't a big deal. Plus, any time I needed something, I made a point to wave to them and they would make their way over! They were all super friendly :D 

The food was pretty good, I had the Cookie Butter French Toast. That was absolutely delicious. It was warm, crunchy and perfect. Next time I should bring a banana on the side because it seems like it would go well with it. However, it was super sweet, so if you're eating it, you gotta have a sweet tooth, my friend!! My friend told me to order a side of the Red Velvet Pancakes, and I have to say that I'm really disappointed in them. To me, they don't taste like red velvet and the 'cream cheese' is odd tasting. Maybe I'll order at another location to see if it tastes different, but it was just a really big letdown for it being a famous item. 

It was a fun, cheap, and relaxing experience to eat here and I will probably visit again! :)"}
{"text":"Wow! One bite of my Rick's Adobo Fried Rice and I was hooked. Then I tried my red velvet pancakes and I felt as though I was eating an actual red velvet cupcake. Can I have some more s'mores pancakes please? Those pancakes brought back some happy childhood memories. The gravy on the chicken fried steak was nothing short of amazing. The prices were reasonable. The staff was very kind and friendly. This restaurant was a bit of a drive from our hotel and the wait was quite long, but I will try to have at least one meal here very time I come in to town. Just thinking about the food here puts a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Love everything, the only reason I give 4 instead of 5 is because it disorganized ... When it's busy it's hectic and clearly they're understaffed."}
{"text":"4/23/17 Been wanting to go here for awhile. First observation is the incredibly long line out the door. Allot of people see this as a bad thing. I'm thinking gotta be good if they are willing to wait 30-40 minutes to go in. Put our name on the list. Walked around for a bit. When we got back our name was called. Mike our waiter was very nice. He is a fast worker. He took our order and we got the food in a reasonable amount of time. Food was awesome. I had pancakes, ranchero omelette, and fried potatoes. Huge portions. Couldn't eat it all. Prices are great. My meal was $9.95. Only thing I didn't like was the small amount of syrup for my pancakes. Will ask for extra next time. Yes there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"If you love pancakes, this is the place to go in Henderson.   When ever we are in Vegas or Henderson, we stop by before driving home.   Love the banana foster and butterfinger pancakes.   Wife loves the nutella crepes.   Solid hash and the Portuguese sausage are fun.   

Service is always friendly.  For things other than pancakes, the food has a Hawaiian Filipino influence, again delicious and fun."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious. The staff was sweet and kind......and good to look at at****.....food came out fast, AND was delicious. Definitely a hidden gem.....evem though theres tons of reviews its tends to not be overcrowded....
Overall i loved every bit of it.....
HEY.....hungover?......long night in Vegas?.....welp. head to babystacks!

(Yes, true,  i just totally advertised for Babystacks....
Why? Because it was that damn good."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times and always get pretty much the same things, but today ordering the Lola cornas corner beef hash was not consistent to the other times I had them. This time once it got to my table the food had a distinctive sour smell. I usually share whatever I eat with my daughter since it's her fave too but once I ate the corner beef hash I knew it was spoiled, I tried again just to make sure probably it was just a different recipe but nope it was a bit slimy taste and sour at the end. And sure thing I had an upset stomach when I got home. This was the first meal of the day for us and everything else was to my satisfactory and our waiter was gladly to comp off the corner beef hash since I did not want anything else but did want to remind them it was not the same taste like always and I know what something spoiled taste like since I have worked in the food industry as well."}
{"text":"When ever i get a craving for  Adobo Fried Rice omelet i come here!! also the Red Velvet pancakes are good too!!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town and they have HUGE portions! They pride themselves on their pancakes but I think that their skillets are by far the best thing on their menu! I've only ordered to go so I cannot account for their service but the waiters that take my order are always polite and I love that the food is always ready on time and is scorching hot!!! I'm looking forward to trying more items on their menu in the future!"}
{"text":"This place has bad service. There was an empty seat for a family and my family and I wanted to sit together and we were told we weren't allowed to. Other restaurants would've been accommodating but not this place. The manager even told us to get out. I was speechless after that. We've been coming here multiple times whenever we come to vegas and this is the first time someone told us that we can't sit together. Food maybe great but I wouldn't come back here again after the bad service we received"}
{"text":"Yay! My fave place in Summerlin for brunch. Super friendly staff and great food to boot! So far I've tried the adobo fried rice (like an omelette with rice) and the spam scramble. I chose to opt for the upgraded garlic rice and I had 'no ragrets.' 
Their pancakes are delicious af too. Eat some there, take some home for a snack later -- can't go wrong with that! I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on our way back to Reno after seeing it on yelp. Oh man am I glad we did. First of all, the service. We got our much needed coffee within maybe 2 minutes of being seated. Also, our server (I want to say his name was Jake?) was so friendly and attentive. Coffee never dropped below half full. Now to the most important stuff: the food. O.M.G. It was delicious! I had a skillet with the hazelnut pancakes on the side, hubby had the adobo fried rice with red velvet pancakes, and our daughter had a short stack of the banana cream pancakes. We ate until we were beyond stuffed because it was too good to stop! The skillet had lots of flavor, I didn't even add hot sauce like I usually would. Pancakes were to die for. Husband was very impressed with the adobo, and he's usually hyper-critical of any adobo that isn't his mama's. 

 All in all, the 3 of us left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Ok this place is legit. It was referred to us by our banker since we just moved here from cali. I've been living here for a couple of weeks now and been wanting to try different places that we don't have or don't know about in my part of the bay. On my first Friday at work I wanted to treat myself to a big breakfast and chow down but I could only come up w/IHOP. But here is what I've been looking for. I had the short stack of their best selling red velvet, Ranchero chili chicken omelet w/hash. The pancake had a nice crisp on the outside w/a nice fluffy interior and very good chocolaty flavor. All the the whip cream and cream cheese  syrup complimented it very well. My wife had the baby chix skillet w/fresh veggies and a nice garlic flavor. They also have a filipino/Hawaiian option which is a plus when I entertain guests since that's what they like."}
{"text":"First time at BabyStacks was ok. Nothing to write home about. I think I would like to try it again just to see. The plain pancakes were solid. The corned beef hash was bland and the potatoes were underdone. My boyfriend had the orange creme pancakes and said they were ok, though the syrup tasted artificial. The garlic rice is quite something, but you better LOVE garlic because it's strong. Like I said- I'd try it again and would probably get something more characteristically Hawaiian- like some sort of spam scramble. I suspect that they get that right."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service was not. I had to ask the busser for more coffee and the server only came back to my table to give me my check. She never came to my table to see if I needed anything. The pancakes were awesome.  But just a little more attention to the guests would be nice.  I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"The wait was long, but totally worth it!!
I ordered the corn beef hash but eggs and it was serious so amazing, my mom and brother also both agreed my dish was the best one.
With that came a side of pancakes that I also polished off, perfectly fluffy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had. If you are in the area and looking for a breakfast spot, you found it! Macadamia nut white chocolate pancakes were great. Service was good too."}
{"text":"I love the pancakes, but the service in the order to carry this time, call by phone for an order and put me on hold a girl and wait and wait so long that I decided to go to the restaurant and still still waiting were not busy I forgot that I was waiting and I showed them my phone that was waiting, I'm sorry we forgot to answer. I think it's the last time I come back."}
{"text":"As a Filipina, I love this place! Pancakes galore for the traditional folks and Spam and garlic rice for me! They even have a larger spoon for those who like to eat with a fork and spoon--there's even large wooden ones on the wall! I'm home. I guess we're lucky, because service is always excellent. My only complaint is that the corned beef hash is home-made--needs to be Hereford canned with diced potatoes for me :-)"}
{"text":"First off....not sure how they got a 4 star rating on anything. Let's start with the awkward stuff...waiting area is small. Staff rarely makes personal contact at the front. Upon moving to being seated young lady in a rush to get back to the cash register to stand and look pretty cut me off....I give her the opportunity to go first because after all I am the customer. They sit us in the very back. Where the AC blows incessantly next to the hallway leading to the bathrooms. Waiter was nice. We felt out of place not being Filipino or Asian....seriously seemed like we were in a foreign country with both staff and customers....don't know why that was. Food less than acceptable. Actually my Piglet skillet was mostly cold. Wheat pancakes for my wife dry and tiny. Overall a horrible experience. Waiter was on the ball but not exceptional. Never visit again...yech"}
{"text":"Amazing! Love love love! 
I recommend the skillets over the omelette because I think you get more and it just fits together better. Every pancake I've had here has been delicious (the nominal charge to upgrade pancakes is 1.50), especially the seasonal flavors like choco mint and pumpkin but you can't go wrong with the best seller red velvet. My favorite dish is the Mexican skillet- it's my go to as well as all my siblings.
Nitty gritty: this place gets busy! Even on weekdays this place is busy by 930-1000 and groups should be prepared to wait. On weekends I would say to get there before 815-830. Service is courteous and friendly and usually incredibly fast."}
{"text":"Must say... I wasn't all that impressed. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I wasn't in the mood for super sweet so I went more traditional breakfast with blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon and potatoes.

Pancakes were too heavy on the blueberries for my liking... can I have some pancake with my blueberries? The potatoes were very boring with little to no seasoning or flavor. I would think they would mix some more in there.. where's the chopped peppers and onions or something?? The eggs were eggs and the bacon was bacon.

Some of the other dishes I saw come out looked pretty good so I'll have to come back and try it. Maybe the red velvet pancakes are that good that I'm an idiot for not ordering them.

Service was fair from what I remember and I was happy that it didn't take as long to get seated as they quoted us. TV at the little bar area had on CNN which I thought was pretty strange. Who wants to watch that?"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast when staying on this side of town. The reviews were great so we tried it on a Sunday AM. The guy told us it would be a 40 minute wait but we didn't wait more than 20 mins. It is very clean and bright inside! 
We ordered a full stack of chocolate chip pancakes with the Huntington omelet. Everything was delicious!! The only thing i would say is the full stack was way too much!! The service was friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I super love their red velvet pancakes!  Make sure you come early on weekends if you don't want to wait.  Say goodbye to IHOP once you try this place."}
{"text":"I wish I could try all the flavors they make and tell you my favorite! So far though the lemon ricotta crepes and the German Chocolate pancakes are my favorite. Though everything I've tried so far is so delicious!!!!
My only complaint is that they don't have a pancake sampler, LoL. 
Seriously tasty food though! And very friendly, and helpful, staff!!! I will keep coming here!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Sat us close to restroom & kitchen & when I asked to be reseated they claimed all the tables were needed for guest waiting. So apparently I wasn't a guest that needed to be serviced or made to enjoy my experience."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! I absolutely love babystacks! Their food never disappoints my family nor I! The last two times I have gone for breakfast I get the Mexican Skillet! It has so much flavor and the carnitas are properly cooked. The skillets come with pancakes so my kids always have something to eat without having to order their own meal (they are 1 and 3 and can't eat a huge portion). 

The prices are reasonable especially for how fresh and consistent the food is.

The only reason I took away a star is because the wait time is always so long!!! They definitely need a bigger location to accommodate their business!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place I heard their food was really yummy! 

The place was busy which was a good sign that the food was bomb diggity!  We didn't mind the wait because we were a party of 10 but the hostesses were just rude and didn't seem to care to be there.   She calls our name and not even a second later calls it again all annoyed like us having to pick up my nephews car seat was such an inconvenience to wait a second!

Our server didn't help the situation either.  He didn't introduce himself,  was getting irritated because 3 of the party of 10 wanted their pancake toppings on the side.  To top it off he goes ahead and decides to make it so that everyone gets their pancakes toppings on the side..  So we got the joy of having to spread Nutella on 4 kids orders of Nutella Pancakes and do the red velvet pancakes as well as.  If it wasn't for the food being so good this place would have gotten 1 star honestly.  Got checked on by the server once and never got out water refilled...

The food was delicious, but I definitely will not go back to this location.

Adobo Fried Rice (Adobo Omelette) was on point.  Perfect rice to adobo ratio and the egg was not to thin or thick just right.  (It was colder then I would like but it wasn't the cook who decided to mess up my kids orders.)

Kids Nutella and Red Velvet Pancake orders were both great but they might have just been bomb because we put the toppings on ourselves haha.  Naw seriously though the batter mix was good it wasn't overly fluffy or too thick it was perfect.

Great food (5 stars),  not so great service (1 star because I don't think I can give a 0)!"}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice - A must! The only adobo I like is my moms so when ordering this I was very skeptical. It was actually very flavorful and I really enjoyed it.

Classic pancakes- We didn't get to try any of their specialty pancakes but their classic pancakes were so good! Fluffy sweet cakes that melt in your mouth!

Overall friendly quick service for a good price."}
{"text":"First of all, glad to have one on my side of town--yay!  Is it as good as the other locations? To be honest...nope! Something is definitely lacking here taste wise. Sadly, underwhelming.

In a couple visits, I was able to order and sample the following:

-Red velvet pancakes, still good, but not great. Cream cheese syrup is a must!
-Cinnabon pancakes, nice flavor, but dry texture.
-Bananas foster pancakes, my favorite! The sauce was amazing--not too sweet =)
-Pineapple pancakes, tasted like pineapple upside cake!  Also, tasted like there was like some kind of liqeur in there...rum? Probably not. Had mine with cream cheese syrup (extra 0.75)

-Loco moco w/ garlic rice, patty sucks...plain and simple. It didn't have any flavor. Seemed like a frozen patty. I thought they made their own? Oh well. Not ordering this anymore.
-Adobo fried rice (Our server called it \"adoBE\" fried rice...hehe). This one was a winner, actually BETTER than the other locations. Massive portion and lots of adobo chunks. Enough for two people to share.
-Chili loco moco, pretty good, except they use the same boring patty and really skimp on the chili. Wish they topped the plate with more chili.
-Kahlua pig grilled cheese, eh OK. It is missing a flavor profile. Maybe add a slaw for tang and texture or a nice aioli?

No matter what, I will still come here because I really do love Babystacks. I hope the food tastes better tho =X"}
{"text":"We haven't been in awhile so I was quite excited to start my day having breakfast at BabyStacks with my hubby on our day off. That was the end of my excitement. 

The place looks nice though so kudos for that but the food is a whole different story. Not worth the $40++ price tag most definitely. My husbands plate was so sad with the corned beef looking so unappetizing, taste was boring. My Portuguese sausage plate wasn't much better either, the egg was slimy and gross. The only saving grace was the garlic fried rice which was pretty good. I order the Lemon Ricotta pancakes on the side with the cream cheese syrup, normally that's my go to but for some odd reason that day it had a weird uncooked batter aftertaste to it. Service was ok, a little bit of a wait as can be expected given the place gets super busy. 

I'm rarely impressed with island style breakfast places and this just solidifies it. I'll stick with making my own macadamia nut pancakes, Kimchi fried rice, corned beef, and eggs the way I like it at home. I don't see the appeal of this place anymore, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I thought long & hard to come up with a reason to not give a five star rating, but really I just can't come up with one! The hostesses were kind & professional, we were seated quicker than told, our server was attentive, but not overbearing, the food was cooked well & tasted amazing, the place appeared clean (except there was a small amount of coffee that had spilled in the creamer bowl & that bothered me, but they were creamer cups so no biggie) & we were able to get our check & pay quickly. All around a really great experience. I bookmarked it so when we come back to Vegas we can return! .....for more lemon ricotta pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Good staff. Great food. I love the pancakes s'mores. If I was sent to prison for five years this is the place I would be thinking about while I was locked up. 
It's cheaper than ihop and it taste 10 times better. If you love breakfast and tired of the same old things like Denny's and ihop or eggs and I and looking to try something amazing. I suggest this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"i looked up breakfast places to check out during my trip to vegas this past week and babycakes cafe totally caught my eye. i had my friend in vegas meet up with me at mgm and i drove us there. he lives in henderson and is in vegas all the time so he was pretty dubious about driving to summerlin to get breakfast. 

as we sat there waiting to be seated (don't worry, the wait wasn't bad at all) i pointed at their specials and the newspaper article on the wall that says they base their pancake flavors off of cupcake flavors (hence the name. DURRRRR. yes. i am slow... but i got there!). he got excited and grabbed a menu. it was sensory overload as we studied the menu like a doc studies a brain to be dissected. before we were even taken to our seats, he decided on the adobe fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. ask i am not a fan of getting the same thing as whoever i'm with (i'll admit, i was a little sad. those were both things i wanted to try hahahaha) i went with the special: white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes and the portuguese sausage and garlic fried rice. actually it was the sausage and it came with rice and pancakes and eggs. i just added the garlic fried rice and white choc mac nut pancakes. and i'll tell you. 

LOVE.

L. O. V. E. 

the mac nuts in the pancakes weren't huge and annoying as some mac nut pancakes are. the white chocolate kept its shape but melted easily so it wasn't just huge chunks of chocolate. the portuguese sausage went really well with the garlic fried rice. if you like spicy like me, a little tabasco makes it even better. 

next time, red velvet pancakes and cream cheese frosting, you are mine. 

oh and btw, love the interior. lots of nice natural light. 

i think the only thing that would make this place even better is macadamia nut syrup for their coffee. or kona coffee."}
{"text":"I ate their Wednesday morning , at suggest of my companion. A small spot but very cozy. Friendly waiters (I had left my phone in the restroom ). I ordered the Ranchero omelet with coffee and a short stack of the Cookie's 'n' cream pancakes. Very delicious."}
{"text":"I came in this morning. Brunch. Servers name was Gerardo. I decided on something different. I usually order breakfast with the cookies n cream pancakes, an Oreo type pancake which is so sweet it needs a side of insulin (that's not a joke). If you order them, get an iced tea, hot coffee, no sugar to offset the sweet. 

I had the chili moco which really was perfect for the time of day for me. It's hamburger, eggs, rice, \"Hawaiian\" style chile with onions. I upgraded to have the lemon ricotta crepes. It should come with two slices of lemon to give a nice kick with the icing. I had a glass of water as well. Felt like a perfect brunch. Delightful atmosphere with the bustle of a nice Monday morning. 

My boyfriend had iced tea, western skillet, ham, onion,bell pepper, with potato and two eggs over medium. Served with an indifferent salsa, nothing was special very mediocre. No spice. Nothing. 

That came with bananas foster pancakes. Bananas needed a bit more time cooking but was enjoyable. They don't need the whipped cream, already rich by themselves. But if you want a sugar rush, scratch that sugary itch, here ya go. 

I had a great time as I always have and today was wonderful. Thank you."}
{"text":"A good enough option for breakfast. I would say they have a nice variety of options but you would do well to stick to what is popular. The many Hawaiian influenced plates are some of the best, though they are obviously well known for pancakes. I tried the Kalua Benedict with a short stack of banana cream panacakes. Pancakes were lovely and hit the spot. The benedict was tasty, larticularly with the smoked pulled pork. However, my hollandaise had the same typical taste and texture you would find at any cheap breakfast joint (as if it came out of a jar), and the poached eggs were overcooked. The yolk did not run at all which is a sin when serving benedict or even just poached eggs. It showed a lack of detail and commitment to the food they serve. It seems a shame as they clearly have some nice plates and flavors but without the execution you are only just slightly better than an ihop or dennys. My wife's skillet was alright but she didn't finish it. Service was alright but overall the experience wasn't enough to really bring me back."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with some friends after our Race for the Cure... We were starving! Got seated quickly (within 15 mins... We were expecting 30 mins) and our orders got taken quickly. I ordered a two egg breakfast with garlic rice and carrot cake pancakes... I was excited. Needless to say, 40 minutes after we ordered, my friends received their complete meals and I received greasy garlic fried rice and some Luke warm eggs. My other friend that ordered eggs also noticed his weren't very hot as well. When I asked where my pancakes were, Jamie Lynn our waitress informed me they would be right out. I ate what I had, and everyone finished there meal.. And guess what? My two (yes... 2!!!!!) carrot cake pancakes showed up... Close to 1 hour after I originally ordered them and after other tables received various pancake orders. Needless to say, I wasn't hungry. I would never return here, nor would I recommend this place to anyone - unless I hated them. Poor service, subpar food and overall a disappointment. I had been wanting to try this breakfast joint, but I would much rather get better food and service at Divine Eatery on Hualapai... Or at IHOP on Centennial. I will never return or recommend Babystacks again."}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband and I have been coming her two weekends in a row. The omelets are super yummy! the potatoes are fresh and well seasoned. The orange juice tastes great too! The original pancakes are the best, i didn't like the red velvet ones though. Super tasty food! Love the decor inside too."}
{"text":"HYPE? Yes. WORTH TRYING? Yes. COMING BACK? Hell Yes.

RED VELVET PANCAKES: Don't lie. You know of Babystacks because they're home to the red velvet pancakes. And red velvet is hipster. But that's ok, that's why I came here too. I'm not a lover of pancakes,  but I am a lover of these. They're tastier than regular pancakes and topped with a house-whipped whipped cream and chocolate chips. And who can complain about a cream cheese \"syrup\"? Its painfully sweet, but in a good way. Order it alongside some savory items and you will have the perfect meal to please your palette. Get a full-stack if your hungry, short stack if you wanna nibble.

KAHLUA PIG BENEDICT: I love me some eggs benedict. And when its mixed up with some creativity I'm all for it. This was pretty good. Not great! But I was happy with how it tasted. The shredded pork and cabbage mixture could've used a little more flavor though. Spices are your friend Babycakes... Cheese and Egg yolk alone cannot flavor up a whole dish. I finished the leftovers the following morning. It tasted even better to-go once the flavors had settled and melded together!

VARIETY: The menu is quite large. All the usual breakfast combos and classics like loco moco are orderable. So many dishes look so delectable!

I'm very particular about paying mark-ups for breakfast food. But this time, the restaurant lived up to the hype. This new Spring Valley location isn't too far from my house so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh yes, the red velvet pancakes are as good as everyone says, it is definitely a must try! I didn't care much for the adobo omelet (it seemed dry and salty to me) so I had the waitress box it up hoping someone at home would like it.  Well, I was right, my husband, the human garbage disposal, loved it!!"}
{"text":"Comparing this to the other two Babystacks...it weighs a little less on the quality side.

I know it's hard for chains to be so consistent, but other chains do succeed...

The main things are - 
The food seems to be a bit overcooked. If you look through a lot of the pictures, especially the pancakes, a lot of them are cooked or even burnt. 
What boggles my mind is - why would the cook even serve them? Then, why would the waiter think those are okay to serve? Shesh...it's so bizarre to me. 
We ordered the carrot cake pancakes and they were overcooked, but still edible. Yes, we ate them. I will praise them on one thing, the cheesecake icing is delightful.

On top of that, we had the Mexican Skillet and the Spinach Benedict. 

Both were okay. Biggest thing for both of us were both dishes were very soggy. Everything, from the potatoes to the english muffin. It makes it to where the dish is not very enjoyable. I don't know if they were just sitting in the window for awhile or what. 

The service was good - we went in past 12, so it wasn't very busy. Easy to get a seat and the server was pretty attentive. 

To round it up - you have a lot of options to choose for brunch or breakfast in the Centennial area. If you're feeling a little risky, do try."}
{"text":"If not for the desert mountains surrounding me, I would have thought I was back on vacation in Kapaa.

I'm sensing a recurring theme here, with Hawaiian food in the desert.  I'm not mad about it.  I'm just jealous, that's all.

There was about a 20 minute wait at 10am on a Friday.  This place was packed!  That didn't change during our whole meal, people eat, people leave, more people sit and more people eat.  I think we got here at the right time, because it seemed like the people who came after we got seated had a longer wait time.  This isn't a big place, maybe one day, they'll expand.  Anyways.....

I've been terrible at deciding lately, but I suppose it's just a Vegas thing.  Too much looks good, and there's not enough space in my body.  I was torn between the Spam scramble with rice and mac salad, and the Ricks adobo fried rice omelet....What to choose?!?  Lucky for me, my mother-in-law ordered the adobo fried rice, and I was able to get the Spam scramble, but I changed out my white rice for garlic fried rice, of course!  

So the Spam gets diced and thrown in with eggs and cooked on the flattop, and left a teensy bit runny, and while that would have been just gravy, they went and sprinkled Furikake on it!  It kinda seems to lift everything it gets put on, that Furikake.  Next time, I'm going to put it on my frozen yogurt and make it 10x better.  The only thing that kind of turned me off to my breakfast was my rice, because the garlic and onion were both slightly raw.  Is that a Hawaiian thing?  I've just never had it that way, and when I cook, I make the garlic kind of crispy and dice and saute the onions so they're less noticeable, , but it wasn't that bad due to my LOVE of garlic and onion, even if it was a bit undercooked.  The Mac salad, al dente noodles with subtle flavored dressing, I don't know anyone that LURVES mac salad, I certainly don't hate it.  I hate half because I was saving room for....wait for it......

Adobo fried rice omelet!  

I'm from that school of eating that loves to cut their food up into little pieces, mix it all together and eat it with a spoon, and adobo and rice?  Certainly falls into the category of foods that take well to being mangled like that.  I just wish it was Pork Adobo instead of chicken.  But I suppose if I'm going to gain a pound a day every time I'm in Vegas, I should do it healthier right?  

The adobo fried rice omelet, so wrong yet so right!  Soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, shredded meat and rice all wrapped up in egg and sprinkled with green onions?  Done improperly, this could be about the worst garbage ass omelet in the history of man, but in the magic hands of the chef at Baby Stacks, it turns into a culinary masterpiece!  Just don't be afraid to destroy the art, it can't stay beautiful forever.  

Good coffee, great food, a bit on the small side, but a great place to start your day.  Just don't forget to get portuguese sausage like I did.  I guess I have another reason to make my way back to BabyStacks."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 12 for my nieces kindergarten graduation. It took us about 30 or so minutes to get seated as expected for a big party. Our server Valerie was so nice and patient with everyone. The food was great, my brother in law order a plethora of pancakes from salted Carmel pretzel (a group favorite), red velvet, orange creamsickle, and PB pancakes, cookies and cream, bacon and banana and a German chocolate--- oh man, they were all so delicious! If you have a sweet tooth, definitely check this place out!!! Everything here was great!!"}
{"text":"What more can be rewarding after a 5 hour hike at Red Rock, I'll tell you what....a good ass breakfast!  My first time here and by the looks of the food on the table and how crowded it was being a wednesday afternoon, I knew it was gonna be good.

My friend was on her whack diet (she ain't even fat), so she just ordered tuna salad and biscuit with gravy.  I ordered the mexican omelette and red velvet pancakes, which I never there was such a thing.  The mexican omelette had marinated carnitas, sliced jalapenos, pico gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream.  It was pretty good but the red velvet pancake was the main dish I enjoyed the most.  I have never been a big fan of anything red velvet and this is the first.  She gave me a bite of her biscuit and gravy but I thought she was done with it and I killed it.  Haha she was like really, I look down for one second and you eat it all without sharing, ooops.

Very affordable too with friendly servers who attend to you right away and checks up occasionally, despite the place being busy.  I will definitely be coming here for breakfast again. My ex and her tuna salad, what a waste of visit to baby cakes for her."}
{"text":"came here for a delicious brunch experience when visiting from NYC. red velvet pancakes two thumbs up and the locomoco was good. I must come back again when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place!  I ordered the lemon pancake in a breakfast combo, replacing the buttermilk for a small fee. Loved it! This lemon pancake is light, flavorful, not too sweet, not too intense. I would loved to have eaten a stack of these gems but too much for me! My friend had the german chocolate pancake and honestly, we agreed that we'd come back here just to order this as a dessert to take home.  How can a pancake taste like homemade German chocolate cake?? Wish we had this restaurant in my area.  It would be a fave!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots for breakfast!! Their pancake recipes are delicious and unique!! The place is small so there may be a little bit of wait but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"BabyStacks has been my favorite go-to brunch spot for the past few years. 
When I go, I always order the same thing -Portugese sausage w/ eggs & rice & I upgrade to their famous red velvet pancakes. I don't know what people mean when they say it's bland or dry, but I loooove them! 
During all my visits to the three locations that I've been to, I've never had a problem. Service & food are always on point! *A tip for new customers: go early on the weekends or call ahead of time to check wait times at the different locations to avoid waiting long."}
{"text":"Super wonderful pancake selection. Like many other say, I'm not a huge velvet cake fun but enjoyed their signature velvet pancake so much. Was a little too sweet in my opinion, but would be wonderful if you have very strong sweet-tooth. Free wi-fi, great host, nice food. Worth a wait."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant that I have been to where I want to try everything on the menu.  I order something different every time. The service is good and the food is amazing!!  One of my favorite breakfast places!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating here for months! 

I've been busy but finally, I managed to plan another mini road trip:

Just like my donut adventure I filled up gas night before, google mapped babycakes, set the alarm....went to bed early. 

DESTINATION: Babycakes.
Mission: red velvet pancakes & kalua pig eggs benedict!!

I  was SUPER EXCITED! :) 

I was coming from Henderson, I also had to pick up my friend, hop on 3 freeways, and took about an hour to get there, it was definitely a mini-road trip! Before I left the house, I made sure I had my coffee and cold water. 

I woke up at 8, picked up my friend, and got to Babycakes at 10. Not bad. 

It was a weekday 10am, and there was a wait. Not complaining, but just want to mention that. We waited almost an hour for a table. When we got there it was PACKED! And there was at least 10 people ahead of us, and some waiting outside. 

If there's a long wait.... it MUST be good. I don't mind waiting if it's something worth waiting for. And having a friend with me, we were able to do a lot of catching up! With women, that's always a good thing! You know we love to talk! hehe :P 

It was about an hour wait... till we got our table. 11am. 

We already knew what we wanted, we did some research on the menu online the night before. hehe. 

Full stack red velvet pancakes, kalua pig eggs benedict, and fried rice omelet PLEASE! And bring on the coffee, lots of it! 

Our waitress was really nice. Checked up on us every few mins, offered to refill our drinks and coffee. And didn't rush us, she even told us that there's no rush and we can still have coffee and chat even after finishing our meal. 

.......................Not sure if anyone else mentioned this but their COFFEE, is aaaaaaammazing!!!!!! I had about 4 cups of it! haha

I LOVE coffee, but I don't drink that much every morning, I have 1 cup a day. But at Babycakes, It was like crack! I had 4 cups, I need to find out what it is!!!! 

So anyways, on to the glorious food. 

I had the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, my friend had the Fried Rice Omelet, and we shared the red velvet pancakes. 

Honestly.... Surprisingly, I fell more in love with the kalua pig eggs benedict!!!

 I was looking forward to loving the pancakes more, but it was the opposite. I didn't think I would like the k.p.e. benedict, it was just suppose to be \"something to try.\"

But I fell....... hard.

There's just something about the yellow (hollaindaise?) sauce that was different than any other I had before. My fave meal of the day is breakfast, and my two fave breakfast items are pancakes and eggs benedict. I'm from Hawai'i and I love kalua pig, but on a eggs benedict...??? Who would've thought?! 

It's aaaaaaaamazing! They were HEAVENLY!  It's definitely a must try! 

I sampled my friend's fried rice omelet.....and I gotta say, I've had better. It was HUGE though. My friend didn't finish it, but didn't take it home either. 

Okay now on to the star of the show: The Red Velvet Pancakes.

Hmmm... honestly, I think it's too hyped up. I've had pancakes else where and this didn't top it. It may be b/c my cousin makes these totally awesome red velvet cakes that can't compare to anyone elses... so the flavoring for the red velvet pancakes were just.... okay-good. My friends who told me about it, they loved it and said you don't have to add the cream cheese syrup, but I had to. I love intense flavors. It was Not spectacular. not heavenly. :( and I was sooo looking forward to it. My expectations were too high. 

We ordered a full stack, it comes with 6 pancakes. The pancakes were thin and seemed small. For me, good pancakes = thick & fluffy, and at least medium size or large size. They seemed like they were smaller than those photos posted here or on their website. I don't think it was worth the $9 bucks. And I expected the chocolate chips to be slightly melted so I can smear it on my pancakes but they weren't. The red velvet pancakes are a good idea but I think they could've done better. But I will still try their other pancakes next time I'm there. 

They were good, but this is not something I would look forward to the next time I'm here.  Others have different opinions so try it out for yourself. My friends who have tried, loved it. Don't take my word for it! It's definitely a must try, at least once! 

OH...... and if I haven't mentioned it yet, they play HAWAI'IAN MUSIC here!!!!!!!

That's the first thing I noticed when I stepped in and I felt like I was back home. :) That's definitely a plus with me. The owners are from Hawai'i. And with the good service and essence of it, they post the kids colorings of their mascot up (that's cute.) I felt like I was at a breakfast place back home. :)

Looking forward to my next visit, I want to try the spinach eggs benedict and the smore pancakes. 

Rumor has it the owner is looking into creating a 2nd location, I hope she puts it in Henderson! :) Cuz the 1 hour drive is too far! But still worth it. ;)"}
{"text":"I have one thing to say: RED VELVET PANCAKES! 

This has definitely become my family's go to breakfast spot. They have the sweet breakfasts but also the savory! I always enjoy my time here and the food is beyond amazing. 

I would recommend Baby Stacks to everyone I know. Keep doing what you guys are doing! Great stuff."}
{"text":"I just want to first point out that I have eaten at all of the Baby Stacks restaurants in Las Vegas and this is the worst and most inconsistent in terms of service. The host staff is awful. There have been four separate occasions where my husband and I have witnessed the host team seating parties out of order. It's not for any apparent reason either as it once was for a table of 2 which was the same as our party. We are not the only ones to have noticed this. This past weekend we saw it happen to another party who got extremely irate. They just seem disorganized and dishonest. They are also not very friendly as you come to expect the host staff to be from other places. It's a shame because the pancakes here are amazing! Try the red velvet pancakes! Best I have ever had. Not super sickening sweet, just perfect. They also give you fresh whipped cream.The coffee is also pretty good in comparison to other breakfast spots around. If you get a chance definitely check the place out but if you want to enjoy your dining experience all around go to one of the other locations..."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite breakfast spot! Loved the Nutella pancakes and the short ribs with the garlic rice  they were to die for! Portion sizes are pretty big and flavor definitely gets 5 stars. They get pretty busy so be prepared for a wait if you have a larger party. You get the sense of mahalo and the atmosphere is lively!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! The usual breakfast entrees are delicious but if you're a foodie and you'd really like to see what makes this place extra special, try these: (1) Rick's Adobo Fried Rice Omelette (2) Loco Moco with Garlic Rice (3) Red Velvet Pancakes. Enjoy! ;)"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever..Red Velvets are a must !"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff was friendly and fast. The food was delicious. We were dining with our one year old and they made sure to bring out his fruit right away so that he had something to eat. I would definitely recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"This place is horrible at accomodating big parties. Fuckin horrible. Given, its fathers day, i understand its busy, but when you get there and say you have 9, and youre waiting for fucking ever and a party of 7 that JUST walks in to put their names down (probably waited 10 minutes max) gets seated before you and your party do, thats fuckin bullshit. Poor fucking customer service. Sorry ass excuse for a \"restaurant\". And the bitch that was also at the front podium wasnt even apologetic. All she kept saying was \"well we dont have any tables to seat all 9 of you yet\". Well yeah if u keep seating people with a few less people than ours, then there will never fucking be a table you dumb cunt. This place used to be one of my favorite places, but a bunch of new sorry ass employees that have no fucking brain can fuck up your business. Word of advice for management, your fuckin employees are ignorant and need propee training."}
{"text":"Love coming here! It's become my neighborhood go-to place. Food is great. Service is great. Spam & Eggs and the  Orange Creamsicle pancakes are my fave!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for breakfast!  

The core items are good, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc...

But where they really shine above the rest are their pancakes.  Red Velvet, Almond joy, Smores (my favorite), etc etc.  Are are very good, creative and well presented.

Only bad thing...they are always crazy busy in the mornings...doesn't matter the day I go, I always have to wait for a table.  But the pancakes are worth it!

Give it a try"}
{"text":"The food here is so good that you have to wait for it. There is almost always a line but it is well worth it. The place is a bit small which means you unfortunately can't help but hear the conversations at the table next to you. The red velvet pancakes more than make up for it though and the selection of pancakes is huge it will take you a while to get through them all. Service is wonderful and everyone is very nice. Definitely be back for more stacks!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast choice, esp in the NW!

Every time I am here, I order a breakfast platter and substitute the specialty pancakes.  IMO, the pancakes are why anyone should come here!

This time, I went with the Spam & Eggs ($8.50): Choice of Potatoes & Pancakes. Good stuff! Wish the spam was a bit crispier for my tastes. 

I substituted the Cookies & Cream Pancakes: Chocolate Batter with Oreo, Whipped Cream, Icing, Cream Cheese Syrup & more Oreo. These were delicious! But I love Oreo...pretty much anything....so I am a little bias :P

Eva tried the Red Velvet Pancakes: Whipped Cream, Chocolate Crumbles & Cream Cheese Syrup. Good as always...probably one of the reasons why they got famous!

My only complaint about this location is the lack of presentation/love put into the plating.  After all, you eat with your eyes too!  Compare this plate from the Buffalo location to the others below :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/babystacks-cafe-las-vegas-3?select=AGi8KQcbeiX8Pt9VmEOTDA#AGi8KQcbeiX8Pt9VmEOTDA

But besides that, yummy breakfast food at decent prices.  I'll be back for more :)"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. It's always crowded and stuffy inside but it's a nice place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I know so many love this place and there isn't much wrong with it but it is very \"ok\" to me. I'd leave 2 1/2 stars if I could. The staff are fine, the food is a little pricey sometimes depending on what you get. 
 Sometime there is a wait , the seating is not very exclusive.
The Moco Loco was the best meal anyone here has tried. Worth a shot to try out if you are in the area but may not be a favorite in the end."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. We tried a little of everything and shared. The cream cheese sauce is a great touch."}
{"text":"Great food and Service! Solid Diner!!!!! Side note the Banana Foster Pancakes are SO GOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"BabyStacks Cafe is definitely on my list of favorite places in Vegas. Not only do they have great breakfast food, but the atmosphere inside is so relaxing. Upon walking in the first thing I heard was the local music playing in the background.  I haven't heard any local music since I last visited Hawaii during the summer, so it was a very nice surprise. 

The menu at BabyStacks Cafe definitely reflects that Hawaii feel as well. There are some great breakfast selections such as Portuguese sausage & eggs, Rick's adobo fried rice, and of course the pancakes. I decided to try the red velvet pancakes after reading many, many, many positive reviews off of yelp. I also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes because of my HUGE potato addiction. 

The red velvet pancakes weren't disappointing at all. Keep in mind they are sweet though, so if you don't care for sweet tasting foods I would stay away from them. The red velvet pancakes are served with whipped cream, chocolate bits, and a side of cream cheese syrup. The combination of all of those toppings definitely leaves a heavenly taste in your mouth after every bite. The seasoned potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and wasn't overpowering at all. The texture of the potatoes was slightly crispy, which I enjoyed very much. 

I definitely recommend that you try this place at least once. Be warned though, there is always a long wait to be seated. Also, the cafe is only open during select hours during the day, so be sure to double check those before heading out!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast at an awesome price.  DW and I got off the strip and had one of the best meals of the trip for breakfast.  I had the loco moco which was outstanding and I can not wait to go back and have another one.  DW had an omelet which was good and I ate her short stack of pancakes which were also very good.  Service was awesome and the price with coffee and tip was under 30 bucks.  Compare that to the cold waffle I had the day before in a casino cafe (which cost 15 bucks) and you can see why I am so high on BabyStacks.  Once again if your in town visiting do not let the off strip location keep you from one of your best meals and values."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the corn beef hash and upgraded our cakes; mine to the lemon ricotta and his to banana.  I loved my lemon ricotta with the cream cheese syrup; a heavenly combination of sour and sweet!  It was regular pancake thickness and not crepe-like as described on the menu though.  The corn beef hash tasted like it was from a can and the hash-browns were dry.  Next time, we will order the pancakes as the main entree and maybe add some eggs and sausages as sides."}
{"text":"Went in there yesterday for breakfast wasn't very impressed. My girl friend had a french toast combo she enjoyed the french toast the eggs were cold though. I had a skillet combo and upgraded to banana foster pancakes. I had the same problem with my eggs also being cold and I found the skillet to be rather bland. You could tell that the pancakes had been sitting out for a while because they weren't very warm and the whipped cream on top was pretty much a liquid by the time I got them. To top it off they don't split checks so that was a bit of a inconvenience considering none of us carry cash. May go in one day just to give it another shot, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Service is friendly, prompt, and attentive.  There were three of us.  It was my daughter's second visit there, first for my wife and me.   The food was excellent with an extensive menu ranging from loco moco, basic eggs varieties, with sausage or spam, to steak, and eggs benedict.  Their pancakes variety is the widest and wildest I've ever experienced.  Out of curiosity, I had the creamsicle pancakes and it exceeded my expectations...absolutely delicious.  It's a \"guarantee to return\" place."}
{"text":"Great for testing out your pancake limits. Don't sell yourself short, try something adventurous, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Finally a breakfast place near Mountain's Edge. Good place to eat breakfast & then take the kids to the park. I loved Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice. My husband got the portugese sausage w/ garlic fried rice & it reminded him so much about the breakfast menu of mcdonalds in Guam. The serving is not as generous as eggworks and they are a bit pricey but I would pick this place over any breakfast restaurant in the valley! They also give military discount which is a plus!
Only 4 stars because of the small serving size. See pictures. I dined in and did carry out the next day. The portion of the food is only for one person. Can't really be shared."}
{"text":"The wait time is ridiculous, but the place is relatively small. Packed places mean good food though. Which was the truth! The hazelnut pancakes were delicious. The omelet could have more salt, but tasted fairly well. The hash browns could have been cooked better but I enjoyed them."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I go to LV I make it a priority to eat here.  Service is great. Food is delicious. They have televisions and great music playing. The cookies and cream/red velvet pancakes are amazing. I also get the eggs Benedict or the omelets, all are delicious and filling. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hearing praises from friends and reading about it elsewhere, I was initially overjoyed to end up here after a shopping trip with my brother at the Premium Outlets North. However, the service and the food were lackluster at best.

Being seated on a Wednesday afternoon, my brother and I were fully expecting to evade the normal rush. However, this didn't stop service from being inattentive and practically non-existent. Sitting for a few minutes without being acknowledged at our table, another waitress noticed our unsettled behavior, and quickly made amends with service. Normally, I'd understand a wait, but Babycakes has about 15 tables throughout the restaurant. Small is an understatement, and in this, I didn't understand the neglectful service we received. I felt more attended to by our neighboring table's child than by the wait staff. 

My brother and I shared the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and the adobo fried rice. The adobo fried rice was nothing special - other than surprising me in being wrapped in an omelet. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes were the biggest disappointment. I fully expected lemony, fluffy crepes; however, what was placed on my table were dry, bland crepes. Nowhere could I identify an ounce of ricotta, and the only lemon throughout was squeezed on myself. 

The price is decent for the portions we got, but the taste isn't justified for that price. Overall, for such an adorable concept, I was disappointed by the lack of service and lack of flavor."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and smiled the whole time that we dined. 

We had the red velvet pancakes as a short stack which was plenty as these are very rich. So good! Very dangerous. I love huevos Rancheros, I always end up ordering them at breakfast places. I tried the green salsa, yum, and they had chicken as well. I do wish there were a liiiitle more beans on the plate. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Can I rate this negative stars? Worst dining experience I've ever had! And I'm not hard to please. I came in with two other people and we were ignored for almost 10 minutes. 2 separate tables that sat down a long time after us were greeted right away. I had to get up and ask a bus boy for drinks since no one would even glance at us. I again had to get up and ask for someone to take our order another 5 minutes after that, which he got mad about because he said it was not his section. The other tables all around us got immediate service the whole time. I found out our waitress was supposed to be Cassandra. When I asked her for help, she was extremely rude and gave me a ton of excuses of why she didn't help us. She never came back to the table after that. Our food was delivered by someone else and we were eventually checked on by a different person. I realized that we were the only white people in the entire place and it's extremely sad to think that this is why we were ignored and everyone else was helped. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Rudest staff, mediocre food, gross environment. Egg Works wins all the way."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab some breakfast! It is open for breakfast and lunch but I have only been there for breakfast and I keep returning. I love the the eggs Benedict as well as the red velvet pancakes.

The place is clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is one our new favorite breakfast places to go to. Went there for the first time on Sunday, wait time was about 10 min, but worth it. Our waitress was friendly and the food was just perfect. We ordered the red velvet pancakes on the side and they were pretty good. I'm not a big sweets person but I would definitely order those again. 

I really like their menu selection, it's not just pancakes. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Visiting LV and found BabyStacks Cafe on Yelp, of course!  OMG!  What can I say other than Kudos to you guys!  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!!  EVERYTHING!

I'll make it simple with our orders of five.
1. Ham & Eggs: (2 eggs, hash brown, ham & 2 pancakes) Deelish!
2. Pilipino Omelette:It was different.   Not use to rice with eggs but it was worth trying!  Excellent!
3. Velvet Pancakes: DELICIOUS!
4. Steak and eggs: Made to perfection. Super Good!
5. Waffles & Eggs:  Yummy

I'm glad we stopped by today!  It was worth it and satisfactory!  =)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ohhh baby stacks. Should have gotten the corned beef hash! 

Long wait for brunch/lunch that I was able to go through the menu and yelp to decide what I wanted. I was between the corned beef hash and the kulua pork Benedict, thanks to yelp recommendations

But honestly wasn't that happy with it :( I wanted something salty (that's why I didn't spring for the pancakes) and the taste was a little too smoky and not what I was expecting...

One pro is that I like how their pancakes are small, easier to eat and cute too"}
{"text":"Some of the best pancakes in the Vegas area, try the peanut butter pancakes with bananas. With so many different pancakes to try you can never go wrong! Great food all around, but really, you come here for the pancakes."}
{"text":"This is another local Vegas spot I enjoyed. So many pancake options! I opted with the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut pancakes & I did not regret it. The pancakes were perfectly cooked. I also chose the \"Bacon & Eggs\" under the Breakfast Favorites section. Came with exactly what it says (3 huge bacon strips, eggs cooked any way u want) plus your choice of side (crispy potatoes FTW) [$9] I upgraded to the special pancakes so no toast (extra charge). Mmm everything tasted excellent and was very filling. I tried a bit of the \"Orange Creamsicle,\" tasted like ice cream! 

The wait was less than 15 min on a Sat afternoon (1-2pm) at this location. Our waitress was so nice and respectable.. I want to come back and try their other pancake options as well as their other menu items."}
{"text":"The cousins and I ordered:
1.)  RED VELVET    7.95 (FULL) 5.25 (SHORT)
Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup.
This tasted super delicious.  It wasn't too fluffy nor was it heavy.  Normally when I eat
pancakes from other establishments, I feel very heavy.  The combination of the whipped cream with the chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup blended well together.

2.)  RICK'S ADOBO FRIED RICE  8.50
A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.
I thought it was just okay.  I wasn't too much of a fan with the egg since it had no flavor to it.  My cousin said that because the Adobo Fried Rice already has enough flavor, to add sodium to the egg would just possibly be too salty.  I think I would just like the Adobo Fried Rice without the egg wrapped around it.

3.)  KALUA PIG BENEDICT  9.75
A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and our delicious hollandaise sauce.
This was my favorite.  I would come back here for this because I just love Eggs Benedict.  The taste of the Kalua Pig gave it a flavor that matched well with the Hollandaise Sauce.  A lot of people on Yelp felt that it was too bland.  I found adding some salt to the dish pepped that up.  

4.) NUTELLA CREPES  8.25 plain or 9.25 (with seasonal strawberries)
Nutella mixed filling spread topped with fresh whipped cream and almonds.  
This was definitely a great way to end our meal.  It wasn't too overpowering with the Nutella and had the right amount in the crepe.  I'm not really a dessert person, but this was well done.  It doesn't look too hard to make."}
{"text":"I had the local favorite. Rock's chicken adobo omelet. It was great, but I think to make it even more tastier and awesome if adobo sauce drizzled on top of it. Or have an option to order side aviso sauce."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite breakfast places. My favorite are the cinnabon pancakes but yes the red velvet ones are just as good as everyone says. Good coffee too. It's a chill environment, the service is always great, and the price is right.  It does get busy quick on the weekends but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Favorite favorite favorite place!!! Amazing EVERYTHING!  I don't think I've ever eaten anything here that I didn't like. Red velvet pancakes are definitely a MUST! Can't ever go there without having some! Oh and I'm super excited for the new location by centennial!!! Near my house!!!"}
{"text":"Went there again, still very good except...skip the garlic fried rice.  As you can see by my pic, it doesn't look or taste like what you would expect from a fried rice.  It does have a garlic taste to it, but there isn't anything in it but onions and rice (that is a bit greasy).  Not worth the extra dollar I had to pay.  Other than that, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Baby Stacks is a good breakfast spot. I was not overly impressed. It was filling and we were seated promptly and had attentive service. I am a bacon and egg guy mostly. I had the Chicken fried steak. It seemed like it was from a frozen bag of CFS's and the gravy was not mixed well. So far 2 Baby Stacks and I am not seeing what the hype is.My meal came with standard pancakes that were dry. Others in my party swear by Baby Stacks but unless you are a pancake lover maybe it is not for you. I can say the staff is friendly and they serve you well."}
{"text":"Great little place. We were seated right away, friendly staff. The Spam scramble was tasty. The Mac salad was quite good. Had bacon pancakes as well. Only downside was having to wait for extra butter for the pancakes. Overall, I would come here again. You should go check it out."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious breakfast today!! We had Hawaiian Benedicts, Adobo Fried Rice, Butterscotch-chip Pancakes (special), Cinnabon pancakes, and the Cookie Butter French Toast. Everything was AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Its all hype to me. I mean food is good but not heavenly great that I will wait in line for an hour. The servers did their very best to attend to customers' needs. Adobo rice is ok. Not a fan of the way the adobo was  cooked. Spam rice is better i think. The pancakes are ok to good. Red  velvet flavor was dry but tasty. Chocolate chips was good. The banana one was too sweet for me. I may come back for a second try."}
{"text":"OMG this the best place to get pancakes. I think there are around 10 different types of pancakes to get, not to mention you can basically create there own. Personal fav is Chocolate chip pancakes with banana slices on top. Can't beat it. The bacon is great, not very crispy, but it makes it work. Overall, big fan who can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfasts that my wife and I have had in a long time.  Forget calorie counting though as many of the pancake dishes are loaded with sugar.  Wife had the red velvet and I think she was moaning.  I had a new dish...banana cream pie pancakes.  I didn't want to talk while eating...just enjoy and enjoy.  We went during the week so didn't have any of the problems that other reviewers had...no wait and very friendly waiter.  No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"it's always a toss up when is comes to every else besides their pancakes 

service is always very friendly and attentive and food comes out really fast and hot! 

the lack of a last star is due to their inconsistent taste in food. we absolutely love the Adobo fried rice omelet sometimes it's good to the last tiny grain of rice full of flavor ... today however was bland and rice to adobo ratio was not good. different cooks I guess. 

it is worth a try just for the red velvet pancakes now those are worth the trip. yum!"}
{"text":"Every dish here was P H E N O M E N A L !

Sunday brunch, 30-45 min wait for a Party of 4 - typical. 

Pancakes: pumpkin - so delicious
                  banana creme - the banana cream topping makes this dish
                  red velvet - tastes like cupcake tops with yummy cream cheese topping

Adobo rice wrapped in egg: delicious flavored rice wrapped in a scrambled egg. what a neat concept.

Kahlua pork omlette - I just tried one bit of my friend's dish and man that pork was overflowing with flavor.

Would def go back here and try everything else."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, long wait time if you're in a party of 3+ people. I didn't like how small the dining space was. My table was sticky and cluttered with condiments. Also the water didn't taste very well. 

Pros: Good food
Variety on the menu
Great prices
Quick service
Apple Pay

Cons: No wifi
Crowded
Not enough locations
Dining space too small
Tables were sticky
Too many condiments on the small table"}
{"text":"I am so glad this opened up by my house!! This place rocks. Red velvet and German chocolate are my favorite pancakes! The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The food has always been great. The weekend for breakfast is of course busy, but the wait never feels too long!"}
{"text":"1st visit: egg's benedict - the poached egg was overcooked & rubbery. that's my fave breakfast so i was sad. wah wah.

2nd visit: eggs over-easy w/ toast - it was good

cool pancake selection & specials, nice service, long wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. If you have a chance get lolos chicken adobo fried rice in an omelet egg wrap. Outstanding flavor and huge .
 The wife had pumpkin pancakes that was the best
 we've had so far from Chicago to Hawaii and that was part if here meal along with the Huntington omelette with crispy bacon and smothered with cheese and avocado.
Go early as the line gets long or opt for the counter for a quicker in and out."}
{"text":"I made it a point to visit this location after reading the reviews and making a bookmark. I was not disappointed. The service and meal was excellent. I had the eggs and whole wheat pancakes with turkey bacon. 

4 stars because it was s packed it was difficult to relax and enjoy a breakfast meeting over coffee. Felt a little rushed and there was a long line waiting for tables... This is good because it shows how great the place is... Also how quick the meal is prepared. But $30.00 for meal, coffee and tip... I want to sit and hang out for longer than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"No proper greeting. Seemingly too busy to appreciate customers, or provide a positive customer experience. The service was ok. I just do not think that they are equipped to handle the amount of customers that they have. The food was good, but took more than 15 minutes after placing our order. A couple of the items were prepared differently than their other location, usually multiple locations prepare menu items identical."}
{"text":"There's a pancake for everyone at Babycakes! Yes, the red velvet are the darlings of the bunch, but there are 12 varieties on the menu including bacon and PBand [you choose]! When done well, variety is such a nice thing, and there pancakes are pretty darn tasty. Of course, I went with the boring old honey whole wheat. I love my whole grains! They were executed just right, not too big, not too thick.  

I enjoyed the hashbrowns. Would have enjoyed them more if my husband hadn't insisted I share! My eggs on the other hand weren't scrambled soft per my request, but that's not a deal breaker for me I suppose. The service was friendly, and the spot is cute. They definitely need to expand, as I don't know I could regularly justify waiting 30-45 minutes on a weekday afternoon to get a plate of pancakes. Still, it always makes me happy to see a local business killing it. When you have a hunch you need to brunch (or breakfast), add this to your list. But, you might want to call to check on the wait!"}
{"text":"Oh BabyCakes! 

I went here on a Saturday morning around 11:00 and only waited about 20 minutes before I was seated. I consider that pretty good timing for a great brunch place. 

I heard all about the Red Velvet Pancakes so that is what I ordered. BabyCakes also has tons of other types of pancakes too. Smore's, Banana and Bacon just to name a few. 

I also ordered the Huntington omelet which come with bacon, cheese, avocado and pico de gallo. This thing was huge and delicious.  

The service here is great too. 

Overall 4 stars. I am taking away a star because the ambiance seemed a little plain. If you disagree, try Sabrina's Cafe in the Italian Market in Philadelphia."}
{"text":"I love the pancakes ( bananas foster ) and the food is good. But I just wish the serving can be a little bigger. The serving is small for the price . I'm usually island servings are pretty generous. No need to be huge either. But at least a good portion . But then again that is just a suggestion. I still recommend this place to get breakfast if you are not hungry or to get something's small with a coffee. But if you are starving mmmmmmmm maybe elsewhere :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever! We come here at least once a week and love the staff and food! It's always busy so be patient because  it's worth it. My favorite is the loco moco! And of course the red velvet pancakes. :)"}
{"text":"A lot of people rave about the pancakes here. Although they were good, the other items were not.

Rick's chicken adobo fried rice omelette fell short. It didn't \"wow\" me. But my husband liked it and I gave him my whole plate. 

Hubby ordered the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice. We both thought the portuguese had the weirdest after taste. The macaroni salad tasted blah... and it wasn't cook all the way. 

Overall, service was good... food was okay."}
{"text":"Baby stacks has changed my life. This is one of my favorite breakfast places in town. They had me at Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. It's a cute little spot and the staff is so friendly. I've been coming to baby stacks for at least a couple of years, I'm wondering why it's taken me so long to write a yelp on them."}
{"text":"Super breakfast, extensive menu with great options. We ordered the hash/eggs with side of red velvet pancakes and the country omelette. Both were huge amounts and delicious. The service was the best!  Each employee went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. Definitely one of the best places to go for a breakfast (and there were no lines!)"}
{"text":"Eeeeek! red velvet pancakes & s'mores pancakes!!

A cute little spot away from the strip, staff friendly and food is delicious, I think I'll pay Babycakes a visit the next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"Onolicious describes Baby Stacks Cafe.
I've had this breakfast eatery bookmarked over a year and I finally made it.
Not located on the strip but 5 miles away, it took a cab and 3 hungry girls to make it over. Greeted right away and seated, with lots of items on the menu, I just stuck too the reason why I came over here which was for their White Chocolate Macadamia Pancakes awwwyeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, with hungry eyes the Adobo fried rice omelette sounded delicious and the Kalua Pork eggs benedict. 

Atmosphere: Warm home feeling, Service: Awesome Prices: reasonable
I can imagine this spot being crowded on the weekends, thank goodness it was only Monday. Salivating til our food comes out, I hear my favorite Island tunes. Why can't we have restaurant like this in the bay? (insert sad face)

White Chocolate Macadamia pancakes-OMGEEEEE were so delicious, fluffy and light. Huge portion btw

Kalua Pork eggs benedict-A little too saucy but the pork was on hit! tender and juicy.

Adobo fried rice omelette-Star of the show, and my favorite. Concept is a great idea, I felt like I was eating a huge burrito but we were totally satisfied with every bite.

Amazed with the sweet & savory foods, I would recommend this spot for breakfast!
Ono Grinds!!!!!!! -ALOHA"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything about this place makes me feel good about not just eating there but being a customer there.

I get the Red Velvet pancakes, not just because they're topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings, or that they come with a cream cheese syrup, but because they are RED on the menu."}
{"text":"Their pancakes are the best! They have everything from red velvet, smores, to even bacon! It's a Filipino/ Hawaiian restaurant so it feels just like home cooking! I love this place. The fried rice adobo omelette was amazing! I can't say enough good things about this place. They're fast and the service is great. I love this place. One of my favorite spots in Vegas for brunch!"}
{"text":"I had seen photos from friends of the pancakes and chicken adobo fried rice. I insisted my local friends take me here on my most recent trip to Vegas. We went super early on a Sunday morning to beat the crowd/line and sure enough there was no wait at all and we got to pick our table. I was so torn between crepes or pancakes, so settled on the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which reminded me of a slightly thicker Swedish Pancake with more tart flavor from the citrus. I also got a side of bacon because, protein. House coffee was very good as well. My friends got skillets and omelettes, and the bacon pancakes (cue Jake from Adventure Time! Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes, take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake, bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make, bacon pancaaake!). Everything looked so good, and from what I had, pretty darn good stuff. I will be back, Babystacks."}
{"text":"This diner is only open until 3pm, and when I walked in, the place was full of people. I ate at the counter and had the spinach eggs Benedict - an eggs Benedict that uses bacon, spinach, sauteed mushrooms & onions. The spinach, mushrooms and onions were fresh and good quality. I was in the mood for eggs Benedict, but the last couple places I ordered it, they made it with some sort of ham instead of Canadian bacon, and I didn't want to risk that again (fool me once, shame on you...). I was also impressed by the perfectly poached egg - probably because that is a skill that continues to elude me. The coffee was fresh and had a good flavor, albeit a bit too weak for my liking.

The Hollandaise sauce was also fresh, plentiful and had a good consistency, but it wasn't seasoned properly. I couldn't taste any lemon in the sauce, which was disappointing, and I could tell that there wasn't any salt in it whatsoever. Perhaps this was to counterbalance the bacon (and I'm not a fan of oversalted food), but if you don't put any salt in it at all, it's not going to taste like anything. The low-point of the meal were these country potatoes. They were very dry and clearly frozen, and my mom's are much better. They do, however, give you several options for a side, and the obviously correct choice would have been the pancakes, which is what the restaurant is known for.

Overall, I was impressed by Babystacks Cafe. If I hadn't ordered coffee, the meal would have come out under $10, so it's definitely a good quality for the price. I'll certainly be coming back and next time, I'll order the pancakes as my side. Babystacks Cafe is worth the trip."}
{"text":"It's too bad my new favorite breakfast place is in Nevada.  I'll have to visit this place every time I'm in Vegas.  
It's worth waking up for.  It's worth driving to.  And it's worth the wait.  

Everything I tasted was phenomenal. 

The Red Velvet Pancake was out of this world!  The cream cheese syrup with buttery whipped cream really made this velvety pancake unforgettable.  I can have this for breakfast everyday! 

I thought their Rocky Road pancake would be too sweet.  It was perfect! Impressive that almonds and marshmallows were inside the chocolate batter as well as on top.

As a peanut butter fan, I went bananas for my PBand??? pancake.  With peanut butter in and out of the pancake, I can taste how any topping would go well with this pancake.  Elvis would be proud!  He'd probably be here everyday too!  

I had an omelet with ground beef, bacon, cilantro, and green onion.  It was like a marriage made in heaven.  Every flavor came out and I enjoyed every bite!  

The Adobo Fried Rice was amazing too.  With marinated shredded chicken mixed with rice AND wrapped in four eggs, this unique omelet is definitely something to brag about.  

Service was flawless, even with a long wait.  Their large size cups are ingenious for less frequent refills (for water, orange juice, soda).  But the coffee kept coming.    

Can't wait to come back for more of their fresh pancake creations and other breakfast specialties."}
{"text":"It ranks 1st of my top 3 places to have breakfast. The timing at this location is always promising not much of a wait if you get up early of course it's very popular so it's very understandable if there is ever a long wait. There pancakes are the best I've had. My two favorites are the Oreos & red velvet. Always get the loco moco it'll be something that'll please your hunger."}
{"text":"Taste is a 5/5, I got the adobo fried rice and their banana pancakes, so good! The flavors are so savory and I really enjoyed the sweetness of the banana pancakes. Service was a 5/5 as well, our server was very patient since witness our first time and even offered recommendations. I wanted to mix my food and have something sweet and salty at the same time so he suggested my adobo fried rice and pancakes. Portioning 2/5, the adobo fried rice omelet was small, comparing it to other Hawaiian BBQ places that offer it, the size was on the small end. I was actually still hungry after my omelet but I was not going to pay another $9 for it. The price we paid was worth the quality and taste of the food but I do wish their portioning was bigger. This place is hyped by a lot of my friends but I do not see it, maybe if I tried another dish that'll change my mind?"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place you can go to. They're red velvet pancakes are to die for. Everyone is so friendly here. They're typically always busy but it's so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Decent service,  but the food was delicious. My bf and I had biscuits and gravy,  the bacon, avocado omelet and side of banana cream pancakes for dessert :)"}
{"text":"The food here is always tasty. The staff is friendly. It's kind of small,  so there's often a wait at busy times."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast place.  Great food, affordable prices.  It can get busy, but I've really never waited more than 15-20 min.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at about 7:15 on Saturday morning, after a ridiculous lack of sleep, and my darling husband saying, very suggestively in my ear at 6:45 am:  \"I WANT PANCAKES!!!!\"

I'd heard great things about Baby Stacks, and I really liked the place.

It was pretty empty when we arrived, but quickly filled up as more reasonable people started waking up and coming out for breakfast.  

We ordered:
The veggie skillet:  2 eggs (I ordered mine over medium), cubed potato, spinach, peppers, onions, and tomato.  I upgraded my short stack to the hazelnut pancakes (instead of plain buttermilk) 
The country fried steak with hashbrowns and bacon pancakes. 

A word about portions:
Really smart here.  The skillet was the perfect size.  I was able to eat all of it, AND most of my pancakes without feeling stuffed, or overly full.

Fella's portion was a bit bigger, and he had a little trouble finishing all of his food, but he was a trooper. 

The food is REALLY good here.  
As with most breakfast places I've eaten at here, the food is NOT aggressively seasoned.  I had to add a bit of salt and pepper to my skillet.  Not a big deal.  I'd rather have to add some than have the food be too salty to eat. 
The eggs were PERFECT.  Firm whites, runny yolk...I'm drooling a little remembering how amazing it is.  

The hazelnut pancakes were great too..although they were a tiny bit dry,  but I find that most pancakes are unless I drown them in butter and syrup.  These were full of flavor though, and the dryness went away with the whipped cream. 

Fella's food was great too.  I tasted everything. ;)

all in all, it was a great visit!  The service was excellent, and they had reggae music playing, which is also a win for us.  

We will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We visited on 4/12/17 while on Spring break vacation. Small restaurant with limited seating. We waited about 20 minutes for a table (came on a weekday around 9:30am). Service was prompt and friendly. The restaurant specializes in (you guessed it!) pancakes and there are also traditional Filipino breakfast dishes which was a plus for my husband. Hubby got the Portuguese sausage, eggs, garlic rice with a side of buttermilk pancakes and he loved it! I got the eggs, sausage links and upgraded my buttermilk pancakes to bacon pancakes. I wouldn't get the sausage links as they were greasy and nothing special. Bacon pancakes were ok but I would prefer bacon waffles (at Hash House a go-go). I would try a different kind of specialty pancakes if we ever make it back here. My daughter got the S'mores pancakes and she loved them! Prices are decent. Overall, a pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING pancakes!  or babystacks as they call them here.  They have dozens of different ways to have them prepared from sweet to savory.  I cant wait to go back to try more flavors.  I had buttermilk while my boyfriend had cookies and cream.  These are no ordinary flavored pancakes.  Not only do they prepare speciality pancakes, but they have specialty whipped creams and syrups for them.  Delicious!  Additionally I had a breakfast skillet which was fresh and delicious.  You could really taste the freshness in the potatoes and vegetables.  The eggs were cooked well.  You cant always find a short order cook who can prepare eggs over medium, unfortunately but well done here!  My brother had an amazing burrito!  Cant wait to go back!  Also, the coffee is delicious!  Apparently the owners prepare their own brew and their recipe is great.  I couldnt get the staff to elaborate on the blend but I find it has tones of Hazelnut."}
{"text":"I came to Babystacks with a friend on a Saturday morning during a recent trip to Las Vegas.  It's unfortunate that we weren't particularly hungry when we visited, because so many flavors looked good.  We were very sad to only try two of them.  However, the two Babystacks we did have were fantastic.

There was some wait at the restaurant but it wasn't terrible, particularly in consideration of the fact that it was a weekend morning.  We were told that they're soon opening another location nearby, which should help move people through a little faster in the future.  The service was great; our waitress was good humored and offered several suggestions.

After much discussion, we chose red velvet pancakes and orange Creamsicle pancakes.  Both were amazing.  After trying each flavor, I couldn't believe that more restaurants don't use flavored batter.  It's really a brilliant idea.  

If I ever make it back to Vegas, Babystacks will be high on my list of places to visit.  Their unique and delicious pancakes are definitely not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I was so happy they opened up another BabyStacks closer to home... although I still wish they'd open up one in Henderson (but my thighs don't!) ! 

The red velvet pancakes are still the best, but I also adore the carrot cake ones. My husband and I always split the chicken fried steak (our favorite in town!) with eggs, hash browns, and red velvet pancakes. This more than feeds both of us! Sometimes we make the mistake of attempting 2 breakfasts between us (perhaps a skillet and the chicken fried steak), but then we are rolling out of there in extreme pain!

Keep up the good work BabyStacks - a location closer to Henderson would be nice :)"}
{"text":"Was brought here by a friend, I had never heard of this place prior to a week ago! This place is amazing! I had ham and eggs and a full stack of there spectacular Red velvet pancakes. It was all cooked perfectly and the pancakes were just so good!! Tried my friends German Chocolate pancakes and they were just as good! Would like to see them move to a bigger space they were so busy, but the wait for a table was not to long."}
{"text":"Both times, we had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to be seated, but the wait was well worth it. Their entrees are generous and delicious. I'm not a pancake eater, but their red velvet pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever had. Their wait service is great, attentive, fast, friendly, and courteous. Sorry IHOP, BabyStacks got you beat in all categories."}
{"text":"I had the Adobo Fried Rice and my wife Country Eggs Benedict.  Both cooked perfectly, brought out quickly and tasted very fresh.  Waitress checked on us often enough to be sure we were being taken care of but not so often as to be annoying.  They have a very creative menu and you could go there four or five times and order an item not served in another restaurant.  You could also go there and get the Ham and Eggs.  Small restaurant with a very personable staff at the front desk and throughout the restaurant.  I plan to go there next time and have the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs or the Whole Wheat French Toast rolled in cereal flakes."}
{"text":"Before heading back to reality and heading home, my friends and bf wanted a nice good breakfast to end our fun weekend in the Sin City and with the helped of yelp it brought us to this place. Upon driving up to this place you can already see groups of people waiting outside so you must know that this restaurant is good. 

I had their Kalua Pig Benedict which I enjoyed a lot. I would recommend this dish to anyone who likes egg benedict. 

My boyfriend had their Portuguese Sausage and Eggs and it was okay, don't think he'll get it again as the sausages were just sausages, nothing really stood out with this dish. The garlic rice that he order had too much garlic in it as well. Will not recommend this dish to anyone. 

Tried a few pieces of their Red Velvet Pancakes and it was good, little too sweet for me, but no complaints here. 

Also tried their Buttermilk Pancakes and again it tastes like pancakes to me. Honestly I can see why people would stand for over an hour to eat here, this please is pretty good, but next time I'm in town I would just pick up the phone and order, lesson learned. =]"}
{"text":"Babystacks is a great place to start off the day - great food and reasonable prices.  Me and the hubby usually get eggs and bacon, which also comes with potatoes (I would recommend the hashbrowns) and toast/english muffin.  They have a kids menu, and for about $6 you get a small pancake, egg any style, potatoes, and a meat (sausage or bacon) - that's a pretty good deal for kids.  The pancakes usually look pretty good - if you like decadent pancakes, they definitely have those here!

I would recommend getting there early though - none of their locations are really big, so if you get there too late, you'll end up waiting.

Oh, and I think they have pretty good coffee too - most restaurants I think have really strong and basic flavored coffee, but I've always thought that they have decent coffee here."}
{"text":"We got there at 10:00 the wait was quick. The place is packed. The service was fast. Our server Noemy L. was nice and quick. The food came out even quicker. The red velvet pancakes were yummy. The adobo fried rice was huge and onolicious! The coffee was good."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast spot!  Our family goes every Sunday!  Some of our favorites include, banana foster pancakes, chicken adobo (if that's how you spell it) French toast with cookie butter (soooo yummy) expect a wait time if you go after 9:30."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Nice area and friendly employees. Will be coming here a lot now since it's near me."}
{"text":"So we got seated at around 2:30pm and I was hungry and tripping because they close at 3 and I wanted to order because I didn't want to be the last man standing and feeling disrespectful for being last.

So I waved my hand up in the air like \"CAN I ORDER\" and the girl raised her hand back up at me and was like \"YOU WANNA ORDER\"?? Ok b.... don't get sassy with me. Got you one star docked for that.

We ordered a variety of different items and shared. It was delicious and inexpensive. The red velvet pancakes were so good as well as the white chocolate pancakes. I don't think I will ever enjoy a pancake as much as I did here. What's the recipe?

My friend got the corn beef hash and it was so disgustingly salty. Had to break our sunny side up eggs on it and taint it with the potatoes then drown it in the disgustingly overbuttered toast that she forgot to bring out. Potato's were deliciously cooked and crisped to the T! Although it was extremely salty and almost killed my taste buds one bite of those pancakes drowned my sorrows away and I was back at my A game.

The Kalbi here was good too. Overall, I obviously fell in love at first pancake. There's like 3 or 4 locations nearby each other in Vegas. Share the love. Come to San Diego, CA."}
{"text":"We loved everything we tried! The strawberry syrup is fresh and delicious! Kids love it! And the service was great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast. The red velvet pancakes are AMAZING! They are so yummy, they come with a side of cream cheese syrup, which you don't really need to add, they are delicious with or without. The chocolate pancakes are delicious also, while they are served with a topping of whipped cream and bits of chocolate chips. I'd say the only thing I don't like about this restaurant is the size. It's a pretty popular spot, so if your hungry get there early because they fill up quickly and the wait can be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. When your starving and your seeing all the delicious plates being served steps from you, it can get frustrating!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live across the bridge from this restraunt and frequent it quite often. It is sad to say though that I will not return again. Since we began going to here the service especially at the front counter has become atrocious. Yesterday I woke up to a charge from BabyStacks on my card for 07/15/2016 and I have not been to this establishment in 3 weeks. Now I will have to take the time to go to bank have them investigate the charge and point of sale date. This is very difficult when using a company card that has to be closed at the end of each month. My final complaint is when I arrived this morning to eat breakfast CASH in hand the place was moderately busy however I am one person and the entire counter area was empty. I advised the older lady at front that I would be happy to sit at the counter. She stated \"not yet.\" I stood there for 10 minutes, single person looking at 8 open seats. This is not that difficult to figure out. I removed my name from the list and will not nor my husband return to here. It's not that great with the hassle attached. I also did have to go to bank and had to open case and close account because I am just not cool with their billing practices."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. Eggs- perfect. Bacon- perfect. Pancakes with fresh strawberries, house made whipped cream and house made strawberry syrup- AMAZING!! Service was great as well. My favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Seated quickly, service was great, restaurant was very clean. I ordered a breakfast skillet and strawberry pancakes. Skillet was cooked perfectly and tasted very good, but the strawberry pancakes were the rock stars of this meal! I never finish pancakes when they come as a side and almost never use syrup. These pancakes were light and fluffy with real, house-whipped cream and house-made strawberry syrup! It was WONDERFUL!!! I'm not a huge fan of sweet foods, but I will most definitely go back for those pancakes. Maybe I'll try the strawberry cream cheese crepes too... :)"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with some friends. Babystacks is a breakfast restaurant with some Hawaiian influenced dishes. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs and it did not disappoint. I recommend trying that and also getting a side of red velvet pancakes. 

The wait can take awhile depending on the time you go. We waited about 30 minutes so be prepared! The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Wide variety. Great pancakes and omelets. Huge portions. Great waitress!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is always the bomb but even better with Monica as your server. 
She s quick, friendly and super fun. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast eatery. I always have to have red velvet pancakes. It's moist and delicious,  not too sweet. Adobo fried rice is the bomb. Garlic rice is amazing. Definitely my favorite breakfast/brunch place. They're always busy so expect a minimum 40 mins wait time on the weekends."}
{"text":"Food was average. Everyone I spoke with was ranting and raving about how good this place was. I thought they offered a great variety of food items, and the food was overall good. In my opinion it was just like any other breakfast place I have been to, including Omelets, eggs, pancakes, crepes, etc. I would visit this place again, however it wouldn't be one of the first places I would choose for breakfast food. The service was just ok. server was not every attentive, and we had to continue to ask for refills. The last thing that I would mention is this place needs to evaluate the hours of operation. They are only open in the mornings so you need to be there early if you don't want to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"I USED to love this place. This morning my boyfriend, my 3 year old  and I went to breakfast on the Buffalo and Smoke Ranch location. They brought my daughters food out and she told me \"mommy, there is a spider on my plate\" I looked down and there was a small spider alive on her plate. I gave my boyfriend her plate, our server was with a table so he took the plate to the cashier/hostess. Her response to the spider on the plate was \"well, go tell your server\". Well immediately my boyfriend got a bad taste in his mouth for the attitude and unwillingness to help from her. Then a male server came by and asked if we needed something because I was then up from the table with my daughter, the hostess then said he's the manager, tell him. We told him and he was sort of shocked, he went and looked at the plate and our server came up. He then told our server there was a spider on the child's plate. She said she was sorry and so did the male server. But really there was nothing that could have helped, I was grossed out and my daughter was confused at the scene. So I was heading outside then the rude hostess came back and said it's not my fault, I didn't do anything. She was over 50 years old and was just rude, she wanted to throw all of her co workers under the bus. It was not her fault but as an employee, to tell us to just take the plate to our server and basically don't bother her with was the wrong response. We left all of our food on the table, as we were leaving my boyfriend just yelled at the lady saying that was my child's plate, she's 3 years old! Own up to what you said to me, it's no body's fault but the cooks in the back. But own up to how rude you are. She kept trying to argue back and my boyfriend left with a F you! I guess there is nothing really that could have made things better but a little compassion. We will never go there again and I filed a complaint with Southern Nevada Health District, they really need an inspection. And they way my 3 year old felt after wards was that is was her fault which really made me sad. She said just ask them to give me new food with no spiders. I don't like spiders. Ugh My precious little girl. So we are done with that place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area for three days and we came here on two separate days because it was sooooo good!!! 

A delicious fusion of Filipino and Hawaiian dishes! 

On the first day I enjoyed the Steak & Eggs and on the second day I enjoyed the Spam Scramble. My bf really liked the Adobo fried rice. Some reeeealll hardy and delicious food here! Definitely want to come back next time I'm in LV!"}
{"text":"I recommend getting side of eggs & sausage and save room for the pancakes! The plates were good but the best part is the pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good if your looking to add a more Hawaii touch to your breakfest! I had he Hawaiian Benedict which had 2 toasted Hawaiian rolls with Spam, poached egg, brown gravy and Furikake sprinkled on top. This baby will fill you right up but if you think you have room to squeeze one more then definitely order their red velvet pancakes that are drizzled in their delicious cream cheese syrup and topped with chocolate crumbs - now that pancake is so one of a kind that even after you read this review your tastebuds will be tingling!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pancakes in town. Hands down. It was worth the 45 minute wait. I got the banana pancake and I was impressed. Super good!"}
{"text":"Tried to place a carry out order but the manager decided they are too busy to take any carry out orders. No option of waiting for my order even though it would be a long wait. Tried to call a few times before driving there but the phone kept ringing each time I called. This place failed in taking care of a customer. I only gave them a star because Yelp doesn't have an option of 0 stars."}
{"text":"This location served thee best adobo fried rice omelette! The meat wasn't dry, as how I had it at the other locations and it was delectable (and I say that with a smile on my face). My cousin and I shared the red velvet pancakes and OH EM GEEEEEEEEEEE...AMAZE!!! We were super stuffed already but wanted to savor and finish it, because it was that good! I loved how this location wasn't that much of a wait as the other locations and I loved how they utilized their bar seating to keep the other tables open for larger parties. I give the staff a 10/10 for customer service and a big plus for keeping the Hawaiian jams playing. If you're from the islands and feel a little homesick, definitely come here to ease it up a bit."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've found in town, the food is incredible even though they are known for the pancakes -with reason!!!! Everything I have had here has been amazing and it's always busy but they handle the crowds well so you don't feel neglected. Besides you can't stuff your face full of pancakes and talk at the same time! Great breakfast all around!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Buffalo location but this time I went to this location with my sister. The wait time was about 15 minutes which I wasn't surprised because Babystacks is always busy whenever I go. The food is amazing. I usually get the Huntington Omelette with red velvet pancakes instead of regular pancakes. It is an extra charge but soooo worth it. The Nutella crepe is pretty tasty as well. 

My husband and I did go to the Buffalo location and they did let us add different stuff to our Nutella crepes which was really nice cause sometimes places don't allow it or they make a huge fuss. Just the only down fall usually after 10am it's jam packed. If you've got the patience I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"One star for good music. Two stars for decent food. No stars for the payment policy. They will not split checks. Their hand written note on the register rudely states \"NO EXCEPTIONS!!\"

My coworker and I sat at the bar to have some lunch. I asked the waiter if he could take our orders separately so we could pay separately. I was looking for a loophole in their ridiculous policy. He states that they cannot separate checks. I replied I understand that for the tables but we are sitting at the bar. He explained that we \"came in together\" therefore we could not pay separately. My coworker said \"Then what if we sat here and didn't know each other? Would we still have to pay together?\"

The waiter begins to look around and under his breath he slyly tells us \"Well they are separate seats so I guess I can take your orders separately\". He took our orders and commented a couple more times about it.

I have no problem with the waiter. He was a nice guy and he was following policy. My problem is with management who apparently doesn't realize that a restaurant is a customer service based business. Coworkers are a large portion of lunch business and less people carry cash as time goes on. We are on lunch from work, not on a date and have our own methods of payment.

This was my third trip here with the same payment hassles. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Why after all the times I've been to Vegas, this was my first time coming here?? I've been missing out! This is totally my type of breakfast go-to spot. They serve all my favorites, it's so hard to choose. And then they wanna make it even more complicated by adding different types of yummy pancake concoctions! Definitely making it a priority to come here from now on when in Vegas!

I ordered corned beef hash with egg and garlic rice.. Tastes just how mama makes it! With a side of cinnabun pancakes. Heaven! Wish I took a picture but I was too excited, I dove right in!"}
{"text":"Third time here and the portions are still really big, but half of our order was brought out and the other half five minutes later (first half getting cold). I imagine it's always busy on Sundays for brunch, but the quality of the food is consistenly good."}
{"text":"Oh babystacks how I love thee! Pancakes of all sorts to satisfy all tastes. This is a breakfast place but all of the pancakes tastes like dessert so much that you forget you're eating pancakes. So if you like that kind of stuff, do yourself a goodie and go here. 

Prepare to wait to be seated at any of the locations. Servers are excellent and other staff is friendly. 

Too bad this place is not in LA yet- they"}
{"text":"Leaving Las Vegas en route for Los Angeles we'd originally considered traveling pastries from Bouchon versus our leftovers from Robuchon as breakfast - at least until I heard about Babycakes Café.  Highly regarded on Yelp! and reported to be committed to local high quality ingredients the small shop was a brief detour and, honestly, how often do I have a car at my disposal in Las Vegas?  Opening at 7am we woke early, loaded the car, and arrived at the restaurant at 7:05 - so early the coffee hadn't even finished brewing.

Entering the restaurant we were greeted sleepily by a young Hispanic woman at the front and seated by a young Hispanic man who would also act as our server throughout the meal.  With water poured menus were delivered and once coffee and tea were optioned for we were told it would be a few moments as water was still boiling and coffee still brewing.  Low on décor we sat back and watched highlights of DeSean Jackson lighting up the Giants on the plasma screen until the young man returned with beverages and took our orders.

With quality service throughout the meal - coffee refilled frequently and water never empty - we watched the restaurant slowly fill to half capacity while we waited...and from my vantage point I watched the kitchen, a two man operation running the griddles and grills with great speed and skill.  With the time just shy of 7:30 our plates would arrive - each warm, well prepared, and accompanied with appropriate toppings in small plastic cups.

The first plate, ordered by my sister, was the short stack of Peanut Butter and \"make your own combination!\" pancakes - in her case banana and chocolate.  Served with maple syrup the pancakes were decent but not spectacular - a mild peanut butter taste within and chopped bananas and chocolate chips atop.

My aunt's selection, a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles and served with cream cheese syrup would fare better than my sister's choice, albeit largely only because of the syrup.  Cocoa tinged, thin, and somewhat crisp on the exterior the pancakes themselves were tasty while the addition of the chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation and the whipped cream was expectedly sweet.  In the cup, imagine a mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned out - a great idea that worked nicely on both this dish and my selection.  As we'd be dining on Red Velvet pancakes for the next two days I feel obligated to note that these were the worst of the group by a large margin.

For my choice, Carrot Cakes - certainly the most interesting of our pancake selections with shredded carrots and pecans studding the batter.  Topped with more crumbled pecans and the same lovely syrup served with the red velvet options I actually enjoyed my short stack quite a bit and was glad I'd opted for less food so I could sample some of my mother's choice - the best of the meal.

Titled Honey Toast and described as \"two pieces of thick sliced honey toast dipped in a farm fresh egg wash and cooked to perfection! Then drizzled with sweet honey. Yummy!\" I will have to agree with Babycake's assessment - they were prefect and yummy.  Significant in size and heft the two thick slices of toast were perfectly caramelized on the exterior and custard within while the slowly melting whipped cream and honey proved to be a smooth and sweet balance without being overly saccharine.  While superfluous, I will note the house syrup was actually quite good - it reminded me of the Sweet Syrup at Camellia Grill in New Orleans.

Settling the modest bill - a mere $7.50/each with tax and tip - at the front before making our way to the car we were bid farewell and told to come back soon.  While I'll admit that in retrospect I rather wish we'd have simply gotten some pastries for the road, I certainly did not dislike Babycakes - it just wasn't worth the special trip.  While the small café would be well suited for a city like Columbus or Toledo, given the quality of the competition in Las Vegas it just doesn't stack up, even if the price is a steal compared to options on the strip - I'd much sooner venture to Hash House a Go Go (on strip or off.)"}
{"text":"Items Selected:

Coffee
Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - Three Crepe Style Pancakes, Lemons, Cream Cheese Syrup
Cookie Butter French Toast - Fresh Whipped Cream, drizzle of Nutella, dusted with pie crust and powdered sugar
Kalua Grilled Cheese - Kalua Pork with Melted Muenster and Cheddar Cheese on Grilled Sourdough Bread

Having experienced the North Buffalo location with mixed emotions when it was still called Babycakes it was at the recommendation of a few locals that I opted to give the since-rebranded and expanding Babystacks Café a second look and with my mother in tow for an early arrival before the post-church rush I'm happy to say the baby has aged well.  Undoubtedly a place where kitsch finds prominence but where classics and good diner-service also stand strong it was admittedly with much debate that decisions were made on a menu where no less than a dozen sweet selections and numerous interesting savories plus specials reside but with coffee free flowing a plan was eventually hatched - two sweets, one savory, yes bacon, no potatoes, and much sharing after a short wait.  Beginning savory and progressing to sweet I must say things started shaky with a small plate of $4 bacon and surprisingly bland pork lost to buttery bread and cheese but progressing to \"dessert\" the story turned one-eighty, the thin pancakes fluffy and rich but brought in check by light citrus while the French Toast pulled on no reigns, a full display of decadence with supple egg bread surrounding a slathering of Speculoos and drizzled with Nutella plus a half cup of whipped cream...more than enough to share and impetus for a trip to Centennial Hills to visit Babystacks III soon."}
{"text":"This place needs to seriously invest into training their hosts. The host is your frontline to your guests' experience! They were seriously unorganized, there were people who walked in and were seated within 5 minutes and there were guests who had been forgot or skipped and had been waiting close to an hour. That is simply unacceptable. I heard the wait was going to be 50 mins so I decided to order to go. There were several people who came and went while I waited for my food. After a guest that ordered food a good 10 minutes after me received her (LARGE) order after my mere two meals the host finally remembered to check the gang of to go orders that had been waiting behind her for quite some time. The food she grabbed as stated was mine had been sitting on the counter for atleast 5-10 minutes. Extremely disappointed in this location. As this is my second attempt at trying to eat at this restaurant as I was a victim the first time I tried to eat here as a guest that had been \"forgotten\" or skipped. They need to take tips from their south Buffalo location. Won't be returning to this spot. Two stars for semi decent tasting lukewarm food."}
{"text":"\"RED VELVET PANCAKE?  OH...HELL NO!\"

The menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=L04CYf9iZEDwFairvDQFIQ

When I saw that popular item on the menu, I did actually shout out loud and created a troubling scene in front of many patrons and a dirty look in front of the owner, who was also there dining with her family.

After that unnecessary outburst, I settled down and ordered the full stack of the Red velvet Pancake for $7.95. The full stack of the red color pancake had six red slices with mini chocolate chips, a thick cloud of whipped cream as the topping and two cups warm cream cheese syrup on the side. 

My pancake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=3ms4kj7wayMeLFKfxJpb1Q

I got to tell you that this cute little café is one-hour away from downtown Las Vegas; the red velvet pancake is definitely worth the drive. I have never had any pancake as good as this. The whipped cream is thick and the cream cheese syrup is very unique and adds the exciting taste. 

This café is only open for breakfast and lunch. The café is also located west of the Las Vegas medical facility. 

The one-hour drive is definitely worth it. And I might do it again and try the other flavored pancakes and American and Filipino cuisines."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb! My niece took us here and if it was not for the hour wait I would have given it 5 stars. They overlooked our name and bypassed us so that was frustrating. Not a good place to go if you are on a strict diet but if it's a cheat day order anything. The German chocolate pancake was to die for! It was like being in Hawaii. We would definitely go there again and hopefully the staff doesn't ignore our name."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have even heard of Baby Stacks Cafe, so I was unfamiliar with their menu and whether or not it was going to be to my liking.  I ordered a chicken friend steak meal over the phone.  Before I even got back to work with my to-go order, I knew I'd be back to eat at this restaurant.  I walked in to a very welcoming, friendly staff and great atmosphere.  And by the way, my meal was great!  Thank you to the gal who assisted me, you earned the 5th star in my rating.  I believe her name is Danielle???"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty....great portions.  I would eat there again for sure.  It is busy, so call well ahead for your to-go orders."}
{"text":"Food value was really good for the taste. Friendly staff and good tables. Kind of small area to wait and had to wait outside for 20 mins before we were seating. Over all great place."}
{"text":"Babystacks is a go-to quick brunch joint. They tend to be busy on weekends but it's worth the wait and I never had to wait more then 15 minutes. Everyone is friendly there. 

My favorite is the Cookie Butter French Toast."}
{"text":"Whoever decided to make the idea of upgrading to garlic rice or adobo fried rice is a genius! Once you've had it w/corned beef hash white rice will never be the same again!

Decided to try something new after leaving Vegas. So gad I found this little gem! We ordered the corned beef hash, upgraded to garlic fried rice w/a side of their red velvet pancakes. They added strawberries and it complimented it so well! I ordered the steaks and eggs and shared it w/he boyfriend :) our service was excellent and friendly. They don't take reservations. It's first come first served so get there early to avoid the wait :)"}
{"text":"If you are going for sugar overload or carb and fat loading (as we did), this is the place for you!  The pancake selections is amazing - pretty much any creative concoction you can imagine.  And the pancakes are light and fluffy besides all the great stuff on top.  I had the Banana's Foster pancakes (only 3, which were huge) and my husband at the Cinabon pancakes.  YUMMO!  The bacon is thick and crisp too.  I had them fry my spam and it was a little overdone, but still wanted that spam.  We happened to go in right after they opened on the 4th of July so there was no wait and it was really quiet.  We have seen the lines outside in the heat when we have been in the area and it is outrageous.  But then it is that good!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Almost didn't come here if it wasn't for our cousin's advice. 
Of course I love to support local and so coming here was a no brainer. 

Upon coming here we did take notice that they are known for their pancakes and their adobo fried rice. We order those in addition to the S'mores pancakes and their breakfast 2 egg special. 

The 2 egg special wasn't too special I thought. The potatoes as well as the toast  look and tasted like something you can get anywhere. 

The adobo fried rice in the egg wrap lacked a bit of salt but was quite good with a touch of hot sauce. Oh yeah, you know this place is Asian owned because they give you some choices of hot sauce in advance before you get your food.  It's tasty but I did wish the fried rice wasn't nearly as soggy. 

The S'mores pancakes are just regular pancakes with marshmallows, choco chips, and regular syrup. It was good but not excellent good. 

We also got the Kalua Pork benedict. The Kalua pork was juicy, smokey, and so good! I did wish the eggs were hotter and more runnier. I am picky about my benedicts but together, they were still really good. 

But the best thing we got undoubtedly was the red velvet pancakes. Slightly crisp on the outside with a dollop of cream and the cream cheese syrup on top. The syrup DOES make the pancakes come alive!

By the bathroom, it shows how the owner wanted to make cupcake flavors into pancakes. I have to say, she did a wonderful job transforming it. Babystacks are regarded as one of 50 US must try pancake locations. I totally would agree with this statement. They have locations in San Diego and Las Vegas. 

I thought the service was great overall. I did wish the hostess was friendlier and more outgoing. She seemed like she had a bad day and it was only morning.

So great breakfast choice when you don't wan to eat in a casino when coming here to Vegas as a tourist. Just make sure you come early because there will be a wait here!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Veggie omelet with red velvet pancakes is a must. Friendly staff and descent prices."}
{"text":"Busy on the morning I was there.  Prompt service.  Ordered pancakes.  Very good.  Bacon and eggs.   All as I wanted.  Delicious.   Went home and back to bed.  Solid breakfast spot."}
{"text":"If you like breakfast you will love this place ! Nice menu from a huge variety of pancakes to omelettes, including a great lunch menu. 
This was a great find ! Yelp hasn't failed me ! 
Thanks Yelp !"}
{"text":"The banana foster pancake is amazing! I'm not much of a pancake guy, but they simply hit it out of the park with this dish. My kids loved the cookies and cream as well as the red velvet pancakes. With all the dining places available in Vegas, they managed to get me to come twice it was sooo good. The service was great as well, especially by Carlos. He's a fantastic waiter."}
{"text":"My friends totally hyped this place up, even though I'm not a huge fan of pancakes. Then again how can I NOT try the famous red velvet pancakes? Too tempting.

This is a super popular place for breakfast or brunch, and their targeted hours (closing at 2PM or 3PM everyday) make sure they are ALWAYS packed. If you come with a group, make sure you don't have any lagging friends, because they will only seat you when your entire party is present.

I tried the limited edition Chocolate Peppermint Pancakes, which were tasty for the first three bites then were too sweet. The pancakes themselves are chocolate, with peppermint pieces cooked into them. Good thing I only got a small stack! I did try the red velvet pancakes, but they just tasted like flat red velvet cupcakes, as expected. 

The wide variety of food at BabyStacks is a little overwhelming, but I guess you could say they have something for everyone. The service is decent (not outstanding) and it's just a hectic place to eat with all the crowds and TVs and bar area and AHH it can get crazy. Definitely an iconic restaurant to check out but nothing special."}
{"text":"Mother's Day and to go food don't mix. We were quoted 45 at 9:45am. We still haven't got our food. It's 11:23. I'm seeing an abundance of to go orders piled up behind the register. There's a fine line between greed and having your patrons whom  invested their valuable time to dine in. It's just the right thing to do to cut to go orders off and focus on the guest at hand. I love this place.. and the wait is great and the food is awesome... but just do the right thing. 11:30- got food."}
{"text":"Unorganized mess. My daughter likes chocolate chip pancakes so we stopped here. The lady at the front forgets about us somehow even though I watched her put my name on the list. The food is great but this lapse in service is unfortunate. That is what I am basing my review on. Never again."}
{"text":"\"I LOVE this place! I want to eat here everyday!\" said my 7-year old niece.  

She is one of the world's luckiest eaters but Babystacks got her!  She had a custom made French Toast with nutella and banana and seasoned fries.  She loved the fries and liked the toast.  She also had chocolate milk which tasted a little watered down... ew.

I couldn't decide, so much good stuff on paper.  I decided to go with what they're known for, Adobo Chicken Omlette!  Also a side of  Banana Fosters Pancakes... yum!!!!

It was super packed but the hosts and servers are friendly.  It's a small establishment but it's definitely worth the wait!

We WILL be back!

\"Be kind or get out!\"  -Babystacks"}
{"text":"Love that Spam is used in a lot of the menu items!! Loved the Spam sliders. I also enjoyed the Spam breakfast burrito! Loved the rice or macaroni salad option too. So glad we discovered this place. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love Vegas and I love breakfast! 

Location:
Located in a shopping center about maybe 20 mins outside the strip is this hidden gem. A lot of parking. Small waiting area inside. Decent sized breakfast/brunch spot.

Only open til 2p w wait times I hear that can grow to almost 2 hrs. Luckily, I went here with my best-friend's older brother before the crowds and didn't have a wait! 

Food: 
Adobo fried rice omelet was very good! Not greasy like a lot of Filipino food. Rice, meat, and egg were all cooked perfectly. It really worked well. Who would've thought Adobo in an omelet?! We also ordered the White chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! This was a little overkill for me since I'm not a big pancake or sweets guy. If I remember correctly, I finished only half of the split dish.

Service:
No issues with the service. Great, attentive, and we were checked up on more than once. Greeted very warmly when we walked in and immediately were shown to our table.

Overall:
I'd come here again to try a different pancake dish that's not overkill on the sweets. The Adobo omelet itself is worth the trip back and dare I say, even worth a wait if you happen have one!"}
{"text":"I LOVE BABYSTACKS.
Customer service is always great. On sundays they get really busy since it is a family breakfast place but they still do try their best to serve you as quickly as possible. It's just the sitting that takes an awful long of time.
Food is amazing with the price point. Definitely try the adobo fried rice and red velvet or cookies and cream pancakes. These pancakes give me life and makes sense why their name is babystacks!!'  
I have tried all branches all over Vegas and food quality and people always exceed my expectations. 

Better than hash house a go go hands down"}
{"text":"I came here on a tuesday morning and ordered the adobo fried rice for 12. 

- it's an omelette with fried rice inside. the taste was good. it comes with adobo flavor shredded beef. not too salty but enough to taste the vinegar and soy sauce. i'm filipino.
- TOO EXPENSIVE. considering thelmas lunch with 2 pieces of adobo, rice, mac salad, fruit salad for 7. babystacks is not worth it. you can even go to wicked spoon and get unlimited omelettes for lunch for 23! lol. well...you probably wouldn't want to do that, but just sayin...
- no water refills? hot waitress but a required 18% for gratuity for a half-ass job, lame.
- i've eaten at their flamingo location and it was great :)"}
{"text":"we came with my family on a tuesday morning and i ordered cora's corned beef hash and eggs with blueberry pancakes. 

- i got the garlic fried rice. my meal was essentially an americanized filipino breakfast. haha. woulda been better with filipino corned beef (onions and tomatoes :] ). 
- blue berry pancakes were ordinary. nothing special, but still tasted great."}
{"text":"My mission is to try every single kind of pancake they have on the menu. So far, my favorites are: red velvet and s'mores. Although I make good red velvet pancakes, the thought of waking up early to whip up a batch from scratch is totally  unappealling so the best option is Babystacks! The food tastes like they were homecooked...and I don't have to do the dishes afterwards.

They have \"exciting\" pancakes that are worth trying like rocky road, s'mores, and cinnabun. Gone are the days of boring old commercialized pancakes."}
{"text":"Holy crap! The food was sooooo good and the service was great too. Kaylah was super sweet and very friendly. 

I had the chili omelet with the banana cream pie pancakes and I cannot wait to have them again. My son had the red velvet pancakes and those were to die for too. 

This place is a must try so if you're reading the Yelp reviews to help you decide whether or not to check this place out, the answer is HELL YEAH!"}
{"text":"Baby Stacks is a very cute breakfast joint that reminds me of grandma's kitchen. Unlike other chains of breakfast restaurants such as IHOP or Denny's, Baby Stacks definitely has an aura of individuality, making it a fantastic ma and pop hideaway. You can almost be certain the recipes are original and as homemade as it can get . With it's homey country style decor and easy, laid back ambiance of staff (all servers are casually dressed in jeans and a t-shirt), this place is definitely the spot to go to for breakfast and a newspaper.. or brunch dates with a few close friends. 

Definite Recommendations:

RED VELVET PANCAKES *Signature dish*  (short stack $5.75/ full $8.95). 
Before trying these pancakes, I was never a fan of red velvet cakes because they were always too sweet for me. However, these pancakes were amazingly balanced in taste that it blew my mind away. It's served with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles along with the most delicious cream cheese syrup. The pancakes itself is fluffy to the taste and sweeter than your traditional buttermilk pancakes. (In this case, the sweetness comes from the pancake rather than the syrup we're so used to in regular pancakes). 
The best part about this dish is definitely their cream cheese syrup. The creamy cheesy flavor of the syrup extremely compliments the sweetness of the pancakes, balancing it out, making ever bite the perfect combination of sweet, with a hint of salt and richness. Words cannot describe how amazing this dish is so definitely try it for yourself!

KULUA PIG BENEDICT ($9.75)
The Kulua Pig Benedict is an English muffin layered with Hawaiian style slow-cooked shredded cabbage and pork, poached eggs and topped with hollandaise sauce. This dish definitely kicks the traditional Benedict to the next level. The Kulua pig taste so tender and juicy with just the right amount of saltiness that goes well with the muffin and sauce. You can get this dish with a side of seasoned potatoes that are delicious with or without ketchup/ sauce.  I always get this when I'm in the mood for something light that I know can fill me up right away and then easy to take home later to eat again. Because this dish comes with 2 Benedicts, it makes portioning the meal perfectly, and definitely something I recommend if you want to split with someone else.

CORA'S CORNED BEEF HASH AND EGGS ($10.95)
Now I know corned beef hash is a very common dish that can be purchased anywhere. There's really only so much you can do with corn beef, however, the corn beef at Baby Stacks has a very fresh flavor that definitely separates it from the canned corned beef you find in the stores. The flavors definite taste homemade, with a delicious garlic flavor that follows every bite. The dish comes with 2 eggs and a choice of either buttermilk pancakes, hash browns, seasoned potatoes or steamed rice ( you can always upgrade ).. My suggestion is to upgrade to their garlic rice *drools*.. It's simply rice that is fried in garlic and onions, enhancing the flavors of the beef to the next level. With Tabasco and ketchup on the side, this dish is definitely my favorite dish of all time."}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations.  While overall reviews are good, there are some indications that we might not love it.  Well, we really enjoyed it!  We were a group of 4 and we ordered a variety of dishes  - bacon, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, Portuguese sausage, and pancakes.  I had the banana cream pie pancakes and they really tasted like banana cream pie.  If you like banana cream pie, you will love these pancakes.  My friends had carrot cake, cinnabun and bacon pancakes.  They were all well received but the bacon pancakes had a complaint that they were lacking a bit in the bacon department.   I didn't not try them, but they did not look like they were super infused with bacon as they should be.

The only major complaint we had was service.  When we first arrived we asked if they had fresh brewed iced tea and the woman taking our drink order said no.  We saw a pitcher of what looked like iced tea sitting on the counter top.  We asked our waiter when he came to take our order and he said that was indeed iced tea.  Apparently the woman who took our order did not speak english very well.  Hmm...that's a bit problematic.  We also had to ask twice to get coffee refills.  Other than those small flaws, everything was delicious and we left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Babystacks, I've given you many a go. Inconsistent dishes, mediocre service, but two of the tastiest breakfast items I've had to date.

Babystacks is know for its fluffy pancakes and its Island inspired breakfast items. Adobo Fried Rice. I don't know what this stuff is made out of, but it's so addictive (so probably crack)! On a previous visit, I overheard a guy ask for the rice as a side and the waitress said, of course. A big pile of fresh adobo fried rice arrived with his order.

On my last trip I asked for just a side of the rice and was denied. Being in a large group and not feeling particularly bratty, I let it slide as a friend said she'd take my eggs and I could have the filling. When the food arrived, the rice was delightful except for how crunchy it was. Starving and because the rice was so damn tasty, i plowed away. I was insatiable. To this day, I still find my self muttering Adobo Fried Rice in my sleep...

The rest of the menu is hit or miss, including the pancakes. Most are simply pancakes with dope toppings, but the pancakes aren't anything spectacular. The most delightful I've had were the Cookies N Creme pancakes. Diabettttus for breakfast, but heavenly.

I don't hate, Babystacks, but I don't love them either. Very middle of the road. It's a coin toss and the same can be said for your experience there as well."}
{"text":"When I hear \"Babycakes Cafe\" my brain shouts, \"YUM!:

Babycakes is an amazing semi-new breakfast spot. 

Their menu consists of traditional American favorites along with Fillipino and Hawaiian delights.

The place is really small and on the weekends, the wait is anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes long. 

The service is wonderful and is owned by a local family and not some huge chain, which I love seeing in Vegas. They know regulars by name.

My favorite thing is the fun pancakes they serve: s'mores, red velvet, German chocolate... the list goes on people.

They also have daily specials.

Definitely worth the trip and the wait if you're not in the area and not in any rush (especially on the weekends)."}
{"text":"Food was really great!, had the orange creamsicle pancakes that were excellent!
the only reason I didn't give 5 stars was for the service, had to ask for a lot of things, like Syrup for pancakes, sugar, there was no sugar on table even after they poured coffee, these are small thing I know, but I still will come back!"}
{"text":"solid breakfast if you want some yummy pancakes.  love the red velvet, Nutella, banana foster... my fave is the carrot cake.  flecks of carrot and the sweet creamy creamcheese icing.  delicious.  adobo serving is enough for 2.  the staff is friendly and food is always good."}
{"text":"We love Babystack! So many pancake choices and they are all delicious! We usually get the bacon and eggs with seasoned potatoes and our favorite pancakes. 
Friendly staff and clean environment. It is a popular place but we have only waited 15 minutes at the most."}
{"text":"Weekdays are best. Expect to wait about 20-30 min on weekends but its worth it the food is great. Try the Strawberry Red Velvet pancakes. The last time I was there I had the \"Peanut Butter and ____\" pancakes. The 'blank' means you can chose what ever peanut butter partner you'd like from a selection of items. I had the PB & Bananas. 

No anywhere as good as most of there items but it can be improved upon. The pancakes themselves where banana filled, but the PB was in the form of PB chips. As in choclate chips. They melted on the pancake eventually but you still have to kind of spread them on to the stack. That would have not been my first choice. Maybe a spread on the side or just spread some actually PB on the stacks. Maybe they do it for presentation?...

Either way they didn't taste as good as they sound. 

The food is awesome and you can get some traditional Filipino and Hawaiian items as well. They have an extensive menu for pancakes and omeletts which are my favorite so you have plenty to chose from. Just be sure to order the half-stack if you're not hungry. The pancakes are about the size of your hand in diameter but they are very rich. 

The four stars comes from the size and set-up of the establishment. Very very small and very limited seating for a place where you have to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated, longer if you're a bigger party. In the dead of summer or cold of winter you have to wait outside to be seated if the few seats that are inside are already taken. It's almost elbow to elbow inside and if you are private person there isn't anything you can really talk about without the folks at the next table being able to hear it. 

Otherwise, this place seldom disappoints. I would definitely recommend you try it at least twice."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. I always get the adobo rice and lemon ricotta pancakes.. no wonder there is always a line out the door ....amazing."}
{"text":"The best food in Vegas!! My family absolutely love this place. Food and people are wonderful."}
{"text":"So disappointing! We have been waiting to try this place, but there is always a huge line. Finally we got in early on Monday. The pancakes - which should be the best item on the menu considering the restaurant name- tasted so strongly of baking powder that I could barely eat them. To top it off, one of them was totally raw in the center so I ate a mouthful of raw batter. The coffee tasted like acid and was not good at all. The Zesty Chicken skillet was lean on chicken and heavy on potatoes- though it was fresh and flavorful. The restaurant layout is not relaxing at all- you feel like you are in the middle of the server station. One positive- the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Ok so I have to write a review on this place. One because I have need had a meal, let alone 3 meals that tasted so amazing and two because they deserve it! 

When walking in,I didn't know what to expect. A normal diner/ cafe. The host was very nice greeted us with a smile and a pleasant how are you. Table was instantly ready no wait. When seated they offered us drinks. We looked over the menu and ordered! Oh and our server what also nice along with a lady serving us drinks. 

So we ordered, German chocolate pancakes, short shake chocolate chip pancakes, and biscuits and gravy( with potatoes, eggs , and a sausage patty). The food came out pretty quick! 

Now I'm not much of an egg person but these eggs were so amazing that my family tried and kept picking off my plate. Well I can't complain to much considering I was picking off their plate too! Seriously, all three plates tasted amazing!!! I never had an export emcee where every dish on the table tasted so good. It's usually only one dish that tastes good! 

For an out of town experience, I highly suggest this place! Great food, friendly staff, cozy eating establishment, and an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, hostess was rude as was the manager. Won't be back!! They all need customer service classes because customers are the reason they are open. Won't waist any money there and warning my friends and coworkers about how bad this place is!"}
{"text":"Ok. Here's the scoop. Loco moco was good, very good. RV pancakes without the chocolate, very tasty. I took to go orders of the banana pancakes. To try at the Volley ball tournament. The line can be outrageous for parties greater than 2. So waiting will be long.(expect up to 45 minutes)"}
{"text":"There's no better breakfast place in Henderson right now. The toughest part about going here is trying to decide just what kind of pancakes to order. I am a self-proclaimed pancakeaholic and I don't care who knows it. My personal favorite has got to be the banana cream pie pancakes though."}
{"text":"The food was SO good!! My family and I decided to try this place while in Vegas and we loved it! Best breakfast at a restaurant we've had in awhile."}
{"text":"Delicious every time, my family loves to support this small business. They never disappoint and the staff is always happy to be there. Also the art work in the Blue Diamond location is superb! Local business, local art, cheers to a long future for Baby Stacks."}
{"text":"Second time visiting babystacks!! From Kansas City and absolutely love this restaurant!  The Portuguese fried rice is out of control amazing!! The service was friendly and kind!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This review is not for the food -

I haven't had the food YET (waiting),  but the coffee is AWFUL. If you're gonna do breakfast, you've gotta have good coffee and this is almost not drinkable. BYOC."}
{"text":"Food and service is awesome! The combinations and different fusions really are what sets them apart from everywhere else. However because it's so little, it gets full fast!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes here are my favorite thing on earth.....what sucks is that I work at a nightclub & will never be able to make it here before 2pm when they close.

I got up at 1 today- soooo excited to eat here, walked in at 1:40 & they told me they were closing in 10 minutes, so I had to order to go. Extremely disappointed. Had to eat at cappriottis instea"}
{"text":"LOVE IT! 

The red velvet pancakes are so delicious! Not too heavy either, even the cream cheese syrup is light & fluffy. Which ensures that you'll be able to enjoy some of their other awesome menu items!

I am a hawaiian girl, so I'll all about the portuguese sausage & eggs- thumbs up for authenticity! I just wish they would get coconut syrup for their macadamia nut pancakes!!!

Even my boyfriend loves Babycakes- he gets chicken fried steak everywhere we go & claims that they have the best. He's not very easy to please either- so this means alot. 

The service is just as great as the food, everyone is so nice & helpful. The two times we've dined here- we have had outstanding service. 

Can't wait for our next visit! =]"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now - once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once for a team lunch with work. I think the service is very lackluster. My most recent visit was for an early lunch. Our server brought us the water we asked for right away, but didn't come back for another 15 minutes to take our order! 

I asked for egg whites overhard, and he responded, \"So you want them scrambled?\" I explained what I meant by overhard (strange that they don't know this). About 15 minutes later both meals came out, but without my eggs. He said they'd be out \"in a little while\". When he finally came over with them, they were scrambled and he asked, \"Is this OK? I know you said you didn't want them scrambled.\" So he basically handed me exactly what I said I didn't want, and asked if it was OK. That was annoying. 

Everything here is an add on. Egg whites, upgrade to fruit, upgrade to a flavored pancake, etc. I spent more here on just 2 eggs, a side of bananas and dry wheat toast than I do on a much bigger and more diverse breakfast (that includes a piece of coffee cake) at Cracked Egg. 

When I came for a work lunch, the wait staff made a big deal about splitting all the checks, which seemed ridiculous. We are clearly a large party that wants to pay separately, but they were saying they could only do a maximum of a certain number of checks, which I thought was silly. 

Good food, and some of their specialty pancakes are to die for, but service isn't flexible and prices are steep. This place is always busy. I'll avoid."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for breakfast whenever someone comes to town. It's not even close. Hash House a Go Go while still great, is a distant second. 

Tips: 

- Don't leave here without trying their pancakes. Seriously.

- I order Rick's Adobo Fried Race every time, it's just that good.

- You can substitute sides for their pancakes."}
{"text":"Cute place to go in the morning to meet a friend or two. The service is average and food is tasty. The wait can be ridiculous, but you don't go there because you are short on time. You have a very open choice of pancakes and other breakfast fare."}
{"text":"A surprising mix of breakfast and Filipino/Hawaiian cuisine make this spot a good one to visit. Don't worry, despite the diverse nature of the menu, you can still order traditional pancakes, bacon and eggs, and regular omelets...but why would you want to?? With dishes like the adobo rice omelette and the Kalua pig benedict you should definitely give your taste buds something to write home about. Visit this place and you will not be disspointed.

Hot tip: if you come here for breakfast, be ready to wait a few minutes for a place to sit. This place is always crowded"}
{"text":"This place is really good, me and my family went for breakfast the waiting time was long but we were a large group. Food Amazing prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Babystacks is by far the best breakfast place I've been to so far.  The hostess/waitress was so sweet. She kept asking us if we are doing okay and smiles. The place is clean and nice. Great atmosphere. There's also a flat screen tv that you can enjoy. The place is kind of small. I have no complaints because when I go, there's only a few tables occupied. I usually go when they first open.  The food is good. Their Red Velvet pancake is a must have. Nom nom nom. My mouth is drooling thinking about it. Well the Red Velvet is nice and fluffy. It's not chocolately like a red velvet cake. It has that perfect balance to it. The icing and dollop of whip cream I think with mini chocolate chips makes the pancake taste even better."}
{"text":"Smoke Ranch & Buffalo location: Food is great but the host staff doesn't know how to correctly manage the seating or wait times. We went with family from out of town, party of 8, was told 45-50 minutes, which was fine - but after over an hour of watching 2, 3 and 4 person parties being seated repeatedly we left. We could have been seated easily within 20-30 minutes when another large party left. Although the food is good, it'll  be a while if we ever go back :( We went to another breakfast establishment nearby and we're seated within minutes because their staff is aware how to manage the seating chart."}
{"text":"3 words: Red. Velvet. Pancakes.

I'm by no means a morning person. But tell me we're going to Babystacks, and I'm there! Seriously, this place is a breakfast lover's haven. You'll find most of your typical breakfast items here such as eggs, sausages, bacon, omelettes, etc. They even serve several of their dishes with a Hawaiian twist to them.

Babystacks definitely specializes in pancakes (hence the name). They have almost an entire side of the menu dedicated to their magnificent pancake creations. It's so tempting to try them all, but I always end up ordering a stack of two Red Velvet Pancakes. No visit to Babystacks is complete without these fluffy cakes! They are made super soft and warm, topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips. Some type of cream cheese/condensed milk syrup is also served on the side. Pour some of this delicious sauce on the Red Velvet Pancakes, and you have yourself a real treat!

Since I feel way too guilty having just dessert for breakfast, I always add something of nutritional value to my meal. Sometimes I will build my own omelette. You can choose from a variety of fresh vegetables, meat, and cheese, which is pretty awesome. It also comes with a side of seasoned potatoes or hash browns! FYI, opting for egg whites is an additional .75 charge.

Every time Hubby & I come here, it is packed with fellow breakfast lovers. To beat the morning rush, I'd recommend going before 10am. And whatever you do, don't forget: Red Velvet Pancakes!"}
{"text":"Great variety of breakfast/brunch dishes! You can see there some Hawaiian and Filipino influence in some of the dishes on the menu like Adobe and some dishes with spam. There's also a very large selection of different pancakes to choose from. It's a cute cozy local place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Our first time here, the pancakes were not as fluffy as expected.  The kalua pig was delicious but some of the cabbage was alittle bitter for some reason.  I asked for well done hash browns and it was slightly done.  It was yummy but the next time I will try the loco moco or the adobe fried rice.  I wanted to try the garlic fried rice too.  We went during the week and there was no wait so that was a good thing.  The sweet pancakes were just dense.  Our friend loves it here and our son.  I don't usually order pancakes personally but I do like to take bites from who ever I am eating with."}
{"text":"I just moved here, and so far this is the best breakfast spot I've come upon. My favorite item are the S'mores pancakes. It can be busy here at times, but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ten bucks for two eggs and some sausage? LOL.

Service good at least. 

Let's add some prices below \"9.95\", eh?"}
{"text":"I was surprised how small this place, but good thing it was not busy.

Anyways, got seated and ordered our food.
I ordered the steak & eggs with an upgrade of red velvet pancakes ($1.50 more for the upgrade).  I was highly disappointed on how everything tasted.  It was all DRY.  I know i'm not at some high-end steak house but the steak was extremely chewy and hard to cut.  There was absolutely no flavor and had to doused it in A1-sauce. The red-velvet pancake tasted good, but dry.   I love the chocolate taste that goes with it, but that was the only thing that tasted appealing (Since I am a lover for sweets.) 

The server was sub-par, she took a while to get our orders and we had to constantly call her to re-fill our drinks.  

Maybe i'll come back, but who knows."}
{"text":"Although it has been on my bookmarks for some time, I am plagued by the Vegas reluctance to drive more than 20 minutes to get to my destination. Going to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North cut the trek in half and gave me a reason to explore this beautiful side of town.

My sister and I thought that we had outsmarted the regular rush but there was still a wait on a Wednesday afternoon. It makes sense since Babycakes can only seat 50 people and has a total of 10-15 tables depending on how they breakdown the seating. 

The place is quaint. The hostess/cashier saw us come in and placed us on the list without us having to approach her. Fifteen minutes later we were sat. It took another ten minutes and a few puzzled glances to get a waitress over to take our drink order. Once we were noticed, the service improved. 

Between the two of us we shared the lemon ricotta crepe/pancakes and the adobo fried rice. There were three thin cakes, dusted with powder sugar with butter, lemon wedges,maple syrup, and more powder sugar on the side. The crepes were crisp. The traditional lemon and sugar combination was nice. We did not taste the ricotta though. I wished it was thinly layered on each instead of mixed into the batter. My Filipino friends will probably scold me for getting such an easily made dish, but the adobo was decent. It was more salty than sour or sweet, but balanced well with the omelet wrapped around it. Not being a big fan of mayo, we subbed the mac salad for house potatoes. They were seasoned well, but could have been more brown. For both meals, we left satisfied for less than eighteen dollars before tip."}
{"text":"A new location, some of the same staff, and still not a fan of the food. After an intense workout, I needed some food in me. I had tried BabyStacks before with my sister and found it mediocre. Part of my distaste was due to their lack of proper staffing and attention to their guest. With an additional location, it reduces the wait time and the business for both locations. 

Our server, Mikey was nice. Came around, took our orders, refilled my water. Another girl came around and offer me refills when she saw my cup empty. The service is not the focus of my dislike of this place. It was the food.

I got the Red Velvet Pancakes as my meal. A full stack of these hot cakes is overkill. They come out with six large disks topped with chocolate chips, whipped cream, and their cream cheese frosting. A few bites in and my teeth were feeling achy. The syrup was unnecessary since the pancakes are already too sweet on their own. I finished two of the six and was done. My friend was insistent on getting a half order of pb & chocolate chip pancakes and a eggs and sausage plate. The pancakes are heavy and the savory items are just average. Their eggs are executed well and the hash browns had a nice golden crisp."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Yes, its full, but its worth it. The food is delicious, clean and nice place.  Cant wait to come here again. Red velvet pancakes are the best."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Their pancakes are delicious probably some of the best I've ever had. They have so many flavors to chose from. The red velvet are great. Most recently I just got classic chocolate chip and they were great as well. I've also had their skillets which are also amazing. I personally like them better than the ones from egg works. This place gets crowded but it's definitely worth the wait. The staff is very friendly and they have great prices! Would definitely chose this place over egg works any day! Mist"}
{"text":"We couldn't come here the other day on Saturday because the wait was too long but we decided to come back on our last day in town on Monday and we got right in for a party of two. We ordered and our food came pretty quickly and everything turned out great. We had the Huntington and the Cowboy omelet and they are BIG. We also got the bananas foster and red velvet short stacks and don't let the name fool you, they are super filling as well. Come hungry because you will need an appetite!"}
{"text":"So I've been to the SW location and loved it. This location...not as much. It's aesthetically more pleasing, it is just as small. Staff was helpful and pleasant, and the place was clean. It was a Sunday morning, the crowds weren't there yet, I think the line out the door started around 9 or so.
My husband ordered a Chocolate Milk to start, well I think they only put the C in, it was the lightest chocolate milk I ever saw, our friend ordered one too and his looked the same, I think one drop of chocolate syrup was added to each cup.
For breakfast he ordered the Breakfast Burrito with a short stack of S'Mores pancakes and I got a short stack of the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes with a side of Bacon. So my main gripe is about the pancakes, they weren't as light an fluffy as the SW location, they were also a tad over cooked and dry and my pancakes hardly had any bananas inside. My husband agreed that the pancakes weren' t as good this time. The Breakfast burrito was good and so was the bacon. My OJ tasted a little off as well so I just didn't drink it.
 I would visit this location again but with all the other Babystacks around town now, I think I'll skip this one until it's absolutely necessary."}
{"text":"We don't go out for breakfast very often, but when my husband thought we should go out for breakfast, I immediately said \"BabyStacks\"!
It was probably around 10am on a Wednesday or Thursday and they were still surprisingly busy. Almost every table full, but we didn't have to wait. The restaurant is small and it got a bit warm with all the food and people but our experience was still enjoyable.
My husband got the Piglet Omelette and a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelette was good, but felt like it'd be better with peppers and onions added. The Red Velvet Pancakes tasted just like your eating a cupcake. I wanted something different and ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and a side of bacon. The bacon was ordinary but the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were amazing. The portion is humongous! The pancakes are thin, moist and lighter than most pancakes but they were just as filling.
Service was a little slow but we give them a pass because they were busy, but everyone was friendly and helpful.
I look forward to going back and trying more of their pancake flavors."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go every other Sunday and always have fantastic service and of course GREAT FOOD!! No matter the wait time, we have no problem waiting every time we go. Adriana is one of our favorite servers, amazing young lady! :) love it."}
{"text":"HOLY......

CRAP.

The Red Velvet Pancakes is some serious business. It is AMAZING. What's a better word for amazing? ORGASMIC? Hahahaha! 

I ordered the short [comes with 3 pancakes] we also ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict which was also amazing. Never had a benedict like that before and it was evenly portioned out between the shredded pork and cabbage. Yanno how some places give you more cabbage than meat. Yuck. But not Babycakes!!

The pancakes come with an amazing cream cheese syrup which completes the entree. I was in heaven. We split both entrees so it was a perfect amount! Got a little bit of dessert and regular food.

This is A MUST GO TO spot if you have a car. The drive is worth it. We didn't even have to wait because we went at the buttcrack of dawn. But as time went on the place got really packed, FAST. Plus the restaurant is pretty small so I can see there being a wait. Also keep in mind they close at 3PM.

AWWW YAH!"}
{"text":"We came here before heading home and it was worth it. The place was packed but we only waited 10 mins. I got the lemon ricotta crepe with a side of bacon. I was expecting the crepes to be thinner but it was still good. The velvet pancakes was delicious! I thought it would be sweet but it wasn't at all. Our server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The most horrible spot ever. I got the kalbi beef and it was all bone. When I addressed it he waiter said it was all weighed out and he can charge me extra for more. He said  he weighted was the bone and no beef. Being 6 months pregnant I wold like to eat some food for breakfast. They \"ran out\" of pink lemonade.  The service sucked. I would just go to the one on the Las Vegas side. Way better service and food."}
{"text":"Babystacks you did not disappoint! Honestly my new favorite breakfast spot! Can I just say 3 words... RED VELVET PANCAKES! I've been craving these and I finally found a place that serves them! The portion sizes are huge I had the red velvet pancakes, the piglet omelette with breakfast potatoes and some of my boyfriends adobo omelette so good! Prices are very reasonable as well! This place is a MUST TRY! Keep having great service, amazing food, great prices and did I mention the red velvet pancakes? Haha you forever have my business!"}
{"text":"On weekend peak breakfasting hours this wait time here is normally between 45 mins - 1.5 hours.  The dining area is very small.  

When we were finally called for our seating on a Sunday morning at 10am, we promptly placed our orders.  Everyone ordered various stacks of baby that arrived about 45 minutes later...except my order.  The server immediately realized that he had made a mistake in the order entry and quickly expedited my overlooked order.  My dish was delivered about 10-15 minutes later, just before everyone in our party of 5 finished eating.

I opted for the bacon pancakes.  I don't know if I'm just crazy because everyone else loves their pancakes, but they were dense & heavy, like pizza dough.  I prefer my pancakes on the light & fluffy side."}
{"text":"Nummy breakfast yummies!  I love love love their Kalua Pig Benedict!  They've invented an all new breakfast classic that tops my morning cravings list.  I added a little hot sauce and enjoyed my perfect dish.  My fellow ordered their infamous Red Velvet Pancakes, which is absolute over the top decadence.  We shared a side of bacon, which was very dry and not good.  The service was good, but the tables are really small and a bit cramped."}
{"text":"Jesus tap-dancing Christ.

Southern California needs you! 

I ordered about $50 worth of food between two (hungover) people. I got to try the loco moco, corned beef hash, adobo fried rice/omelette, garlic fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. The loco moco, corned beef hash and garlic fried rice were good in their own respects but could be passed on. The adobo fried-rice/omelette on the other hand... delicious. Would love to see over easy eggs on top of the adobo fried rice as opposed to a solid scrambled/omelette piece.. in which I shall note for the next Vegas trip. But what really stole my heart were the red velvet pancakes. I'd break my diet and lose dem gainz anytime for those wonderful pancakes. 

Other than that, the service was spot-on and was rather exceptional. 

A slight trek from the strip, but quite the delicious hangover cure none the less.

Easy 5-stars.

{"text":"By sheer luck I stumbled upon this place when looking for good eats in Vegas! I'm not a pancake fan by any stretch of the imagination, but the reviews made them sound so good that I was a believer. I'm really happy I got over my hatred for pancakes and gave Babycakes a try.

My brothers, a friend, and I made this our last stop in Vegas before heading home. While it was a little out of the way for us, it was well worth it. We waited maybe 20 minutes, just long enough for me to change my mind on my order a few hundred times. I was going to go with the s'mores pancakes or the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, but I ended up giving in to the Yelp reviews and going with the red velvet.

And you thought my hatred for pancakes was bad, I despise red velvet. Not because it tastes bad (it doesn't), but EVERYONE is doing it. Every bakery and cupcake shop from here to Kalamazoo is doing it. Every baker on Cupcake Wars thinks they have the original, prize winning, most amazing, down-home, just like moms red velvet cupcake. It's run of the mill. It's tired. It's boring. It's so freaking cliche I can't handle it.

Then there was Babycakes. It's criminal what they've done here. A short stack (three pancakes, full stacks are six) of fluffy, brilliantly colored red pancakes command your attention from across the restaurant (and they did at least three times). On top sits a generous mound of whipped cream studded with chocolate chips. Heaven on earth! They come with a side of a lightly sweetened cream cheese syrup. The pancakes are prefect without the syrup, but add a little and you'll be sure to find yourself in a foodie nirvana. The red velvet pancakes were simply amazing. Sweet, tender, not at all like any other pancake I've had.

My brother had the cinnamon roll pancakes and they were delicious as well. I'm not entirely sure if the pancakes themselves were  regular pancakes or something else, but they were good. Topped with a cross-hatch of the cream cheese frosting, a dusting of cinnamon sugar, and a generous handful of walnuts and these things are phenomenal!!! They come with a side of regular syrup, though I doubt you'll be needing that.

My friend loved her omelette, but her pancakes were the epitome of my distaste for pancakes. This surely wasn't Babycakes' fault, I blame the pancakes. My brother loved his bacon pancakes.

Service was great, really friendly. We ordered and our food was out within minutes. Everyone was so friendly and the food was delicious. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Fun, tiny joint w decent service and decent food. A bit overrated (hence the 3-stars), but decent for portion and price.

Benedict: eggs were cooked perfectly, but the hollandaise sauce was tired and bland (needed more lemon and salt/pepper)

Lemon Ricotta Pancakes: great consistency, could have been more crisp on the outside. 

Bananas Fosters French Toast: properly cooked, but omg too sweet! 

Buttermilk Pancakes: decent consistency, but completely overrated. Not the best in town, but again decent for portion and price

Potatoes: hashed browns or \"seasoned\" home fries - undercooked and meh"}
{"text":"If I had to rank the meals in the day, Breakfast would be dead last for me.  There are a few reasons for this:   1) My lactose intolerance limits a lot of the cheesy/milky items I would normally want to order, and I don't like starting my day with an angry tummy.   2) I usually don't have time (weekdays) or motivation (weekends) to really go anywhere to grab something.  On this Sunday, I had to drop off a friend who had a little too much to drink last night as well as a tux rental to Men's Wearhouse, and decided it seemed like a good day to try a breakfast place I'd heard a lot about.  You know, carpe diem and all that.

Upon walking into Babystacks, I wasn't surprised to see a large crowd sitting around waiting for a table, and we signed in and were told it'd be a 15-25 minute wait.  Quick sidenote: While we were seated near the door, my friend pointed out a black widow spider crawling along the floor that went underneath our bench.   I did the good Samaritan deed and promptly stood up and switched seats.  It looked harmless, really.  

Once seated I ordered an orange juice which I'd forgotten was so expensive when eating out.  I naturally ordered a full order of Red Velvet pancakes, because if I'm going to blow up my insides with lactose goodness, I'm going all the way.  A short time later I was presented with a beautiful plate of 6 huge, red pancakes with the fixings.  The first bite was heaven, and 15 minutes later, the last bite was heaven.  I can't really add anything that probably hasn't already been said about them.   The rumors are true, the hype is justified, the pancakes are freaking delicious.

Next time I would switch it up and probably just get a 1/2 order with some side order of something savory.  The couple next to us ordered some sort of skillet or plate with some lovely pieces of cooked animal flesh that were really disarming to me as I continuously shoved my mouth full of candy in pancake form.   Yes, next time I need bacon with my candy.

Service was fine, though it did take a little while for the waitress to take our order after we got our drinks.  Obviously it was packed so I was understanding of it, and once the food arrived, no complaints.  The prices are very reasonable.  

Now I just need one closer to my house that delivers, and breakfast can be making a strong case for being #2 after dinner."}
{"text":"Baby Stacks Cafe is our go to for a late morning breakfast. They food and service is always great and consistent. Definitely give them a try for top notch breakfast and lunch selections."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic!!! It was my first time trying the pancakes and the egg sausage rice ...we will definitely come back with my family again!"}
{"text":"This place is PACKED for breakfast on weekends so get there early if you dont want to wait. Awesome food at fair prices and plenty of interesting things to try. We arent big sweet eaters so we've stayed on the non-pancake side of the menu, but everything we've had has been great. Fun, kid friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"We had breakfast. The water must have come out of the tap because it had a horrible after taste. I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs over medium. Eggs barely cooked and the sausage was chewy, not sure how they did that. Service was fine and attentive, but few people there. I may give it one more chance. Maybe I went on an off day."}
{"text":"We love this place! When it is not busy, we always get our ordered food at least within 10 mins of sitting down. We always get their adobo fried rice portuguese sausages with garlic fried rice and eggs. It comes with sides. I forgot the choices but we always get the red velvet pancakes with a small surcharge. This works with us since I have a 4 year old girl who can't finish a whole stack of pancakes so this option comes in handy! Service is good! When they're busy,  just be patient and be considerate... will recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Eh...it was ok. I'm a breakfast food connoisseur...addict, however you want to put it and have now tried nearly every breakfast joint in Vegas. The verdict: Eggs Works and The Cracked Egg trump this place in regards to menu and taste. I liked my food - and my friend's food whose plates I smuggled bites from, but unless it's for a meeting and someone else is paying or Egg Works and the Cracked Egg both close, I probably won't go back. But the worst part is, since leaving there I now smell like an omelette! Seriously, I just had to febreeze myself because I stink!!"}
{"text":"This place is still one of my fave for Hawaiian breakfast. However, the last two times I ordered my food to go, they continued to mess it up. The first time, I had to go back and exchanged the order which made me late for work. I ended up eating while driving. Today, I ordered kalua eggs Benedict and they messed it up again. One of the reasons I eat eggs Benedict is because i love poached eggs with runny yolk. Of course, Both of my eggs were completely overcooked , and to make it worse, my English muffin was all soggy. So I ended up eating kalua pork with potatoes. I still like this place and eat here regularly but it's really disappointing when you're hungry & can't eat what you want. Who have time to keep going back & forth to exchange order ... although I'm sure they would've happily give me new eggs, but that's not the point. I wouldn't waste my time to write a review if this only happens once. I'm just really disappointed & probably wouldn't order here again."}
{"text":"Classic breakfast place. The staff is great and friendly.  It's like going home cause they make you feel like family.  I like the pancakes. So many choice you can have a different flavor every day.  I went on a weekday so i dont know about the long waits"}
{"text":"I have dreams about the Kahlua Benedict! It sounded interesting, so the first time I ate here I ordered it. I've been hooked ever since! I tell myself that I'm going to try one of the amazing looking pancakes, but every time I get there I remember the sweet smoky flavor of kahlua pork mingled with the warm egg yolk, rich hollandaise sauce, and crunchy shredded cabbage. I can't order anything else! My daughter has ordered the s'mores pancakes and I did get to taste those, which were heavenly. She has also ordered the spam sliders, but was disappointed to find out the spam was diced and cooked with egg and onion, instead of just spam slices. My parents have both tried different omelettes and have enjoyed them. The service is consistently attentive and the prices are reasonable. This is definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas."}
{"text":"You better come bright and early or you'll be stuck with the 30-45 minute wait! Most of the Babystacks locations are a bit on the smaller side and they won't sit incomplete parties. For these reasons, I only give four stars. 

The staff is very friendly and I love the island music they play. 

Babystacks is where I became obsessed with country fried steak. It is to die for! Gravy is delicious, steak is crunchy and flavorful, hash browns (or potato squares) are my favorite! 

I believe Babystacks is well known for their red velvet pancakes (you can sub your toast for pancakes for a little extra... do it). All their pancakes are delicious: lemon ricotta, white chocolate macadamia nut, s'mores pancakes... you name it! 

I've also had their adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg blanket with potato squares! Yum! And their cookie butter French toast is also delicious! You can get anything on the menu and it would be yummy! 

I love coming to Babystacks, but I'll only come when I'm able to wake up early."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!!!!! My wife and used to frequent this place every weekend.  The food is delicious and the waiters and waitresses are great.  Their red velvet pancakes are awesome - you can never go wrong with those.  The cookies and cream and banana foster pancakes are great also.  There eggs and meats are just like any other breakfast place, but the reason to go there is for the pancakes.   Get there before 8:00 AM to avoid the wait on the weekends.  It's worth getting up early!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! Ordered corned beef hash garlic rice and it tasted so good! 
The corned beef hash is tasty and flavorful and goes so well with the garlic rice (even though the rice is a little oily) 

My order also came with a baby stack of pancakes with strawberry sauce! Which I added strawberries and whipped cream (cause I love strawberries) and it was so good! The pancake itself is really yummy!!

The staff is so nice and polite, ordering on the phone was easy and the time estimate was accurate 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Food was fusion american/filipino, the food was good, nothing amazing, just comfort food after a night spent in Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with my 7 year old daughter. There was a wait like 25-35 minute wait. That's ok, that for me is a sign of a good place. We decided to go next door to the Walgreens. They called our name before the 25-30 minutes were up. We were still at Walgreens. But, when we showed up they sat us as soon as possible and it was very quick. My daughter got the banana pancake kids meal and I got a Hawaiian  chili omelette with red velvet pancakes. I have to say the red velvet pancakes are not overrated! I am not big on sweets and I couldn't get enough of them! I did get extra cream cheese sauce and they do charge you for it, but it was so worth it. It was so delicious! My daughters banana pancakes were very tasty as well. 

The omelette was good, too. But, I do believe the pancakes are the way to go. So yummy! Service was good, even though they were busy. There were a few mistakes, but they were rectified promptly. Will definitely return! It was one of the best breakfast I've ever had."}
{"text":"I got the s'mores pancake, pretty sweet. My friend got the adobo fried rice and that was really good. Will get adobo fried rice next time. Service was fast too."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I had the bananas foster crepe. Yum! They are always super busy and the wait is usually pretty long. At times the staff seemed a little frazzled and checkout is a nightmare. Just be patient though, the food is with it."}
{"text":"This morning I'm going solo, had early morning appt so I decided breakfast was a necessity. 

I ordered the ranchero omelet with carrot cake pancakes, just $1.25 more. It was a very good choice! The om let had chicken inside that was cut into cubed pieces, one side had been crispy, but it was still moist. The ranchero sauce on top was spice with just a hint of sweetness. 

I enjoyed breakfast so much, I ordered a BLT for lunch!"}
{"text":"As a kid growing up in the south, we'd eat cream of wheat in the winter months, on Sundays, mom would make biscuits and soft boiled eggs with sausage and bacon. Occasionally we'd get to eat pancakes, granted there were seven of us in all, so we were taking turns puring the batter and flippin cakes, and sometimes, we only got one.   

My mom never made them different by adding banana slices, or topped off with chocolate sprinkles, so for me, seeing BabyStacks selection, and my love for deserts, I feel I am getting the best of both worlds.   

This is a great breakfast place.  You can get your usual items, like omelets, eggs, bacon and sausage, but you can also get a variety of pancakes.  There are plain old fashion cakes, and then there are the \"gourmet\" cakes as I call them.  

I think that BabyStacks  was the first place I heard of that took flavors like red velvet and smores and made them into a pancake.  I love them!"}
{"text":"Forget your 100 year old chain diners like IHOP and Danny's and try the breakfast here. This place gives you a family feel and home cooking style breakfast with a twist. Creative yet simple pancakes and breakfast items that you can eat anytime of the day.

Service is as best as it can be almost every time and food is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Omg. So good. I was afraid to try the red velvet pancakes because I thought it'd be too sweet but boy am I glad I did! It was absolutely perfect! I love how they gave the cream cheese syrup on the side so it's not drenched or covered completely with it like a red velvet cupcake! I thought the service was amazing, our coffee was refilled quickly and they were super nice and accommodating to us even when we had 2 toddler boys with us. We also had the cowboy omelette and it came with the perfect amount of ingredients- the ham, green peppers and onions and even the cheese- it was perfectly balanced. We also loved the blueberry pancakes and my 4 year old loved the banana ones. I definitely cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This has become our go to breakfast place in Vegas. The pancakes are great. Not too sweet, soft on the inside with a slight crisp outside. The Hawaiian benedict is fantastic, and the adobo fried rice omelette is just awesome."}
{"text":"A bit off the beaten path if you're staying on the strip but well worth the $20 cab ride. The breakfast was great and prices reasonable. I'm not a big fan of pancakes but ordered some with my breakfast and the Blueberry ones were tasty. The entire staff we interacted with were super friendly. Only negative would be no Bloody Marys or Mimosas which would have been great."}
{"text":"When we first arrived the restaurant was full and there seemed to be a wait. No problem. Except for that we stood there waiting for 15min ehile no one even greeted us. Once finally greeted we then waited another 10 min while they bussed several tables that had been empty since we had walked in. Upon being sat we were only given 2 menus for 4 people. Drinks were ordered and only 1 of the correct drinks was delivered. We looked over the menu decided on our meals and waited to order. After ordering and asking again for coloring pages for the kids we waited. One persons food came out at a time. Except one order. The server about 15min after everyone elses food was delivered approached the table and asked do you guys need anything else. I responded with ya my food would be great. It took another 10 min as Im assuming the server for got to put it in. The order was bacon and eggs and potatos. Nothing fancy or complicated. The server seemed more put out by the fact that I was asking for my food then anything. By the time it arrived everyone at the table was finished eating. So I ate a few bites quickly and didnt finish as it was not how I ordered my eggs cooked 
(I am pregnant so I cant eat under cooked eggs)and I got hashbrowns instead of the potatos I ordered. We asked for the check and again waited. At this point there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant besides us. The server avoided the table after dropping the check as nothing was remedied about my food being forgotten. We then waited to pay standing at the counter for another 10min. A seemingly quick lunch turned into almost 2 hours unfortunately."}
{"text":"Had to try this place out after seeing all the different kinds of pancakes they offer.  We arrived around 11 on a Monday morning and even with a rush at that time there was little to no wait and it quieted down later that hour.  *Note: Your whole party must be present to be seated and parties of 2 get seated more quickly.

I ordered a b.y.o. omelette (I ordered mine with Swiss cheese, spinach, and mushroom) which came with potatoes (you can order hash browns instead) and a short stack of omelettes.  For a small charge I upgraded my pancakes to the banana cream pie pancakes.  Everything I ordered was very tasty!  I had some of the white chocolate macadamia pancakes as well and must say I liked the banana cream pie pancakes better.  So glad I went with them after much deliberation!

It's a fairly short drive if you're staying on the Strip and there is ample parking in the lot.  They've got a couple of TV's inside which kept us entertained as Chippendales was on the morning news show that was playing ;)  Definitely worth checking out for a tasty breakfast!"}
{"text":"Best loco moco and blueberry pancakes in town! However, the garlic rice could use a little less garlic, last time i had it, it was really overbearing. But great service, comfortable, affordable and big proportions:)"}
{"text":"The wait is absolutely bananas. 

BUT, I did manage to make a few people angry by realizing that take out is 100 times more convenient than sitting in a small dining area and waiting for an hour. I ordered and left.. in about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, all the angry folks stared as we walked out with our delicious meals in hand. 

As for the food, the red velvet pancakes are definitely a must try. We built our own omelette, that was just okay. The seasoned potatoes are  little fried cubes of tastiness. Ohh, add some blueberry pancakes, and we filled our tanks up with only $22. 

AHHHH- MAZING."}
{"text":"I am sooooo full. This place was so good that I had to write the review while still here !! I had the Huntington omelette and the banana cream pie pancakes and O M G.... everything was soooo good. The pico de Gallo on the side was a perfect addition to the Tabasco sauce I added but those freaking PANCAKES!!! Wow. This is probably going to be my go to breakfast spot from now on. Service was quick and friendly and the food was amazing. 

Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Buffalo/Flamingo - great service!!!  Much better experience than when we ate at the Smoke Ranch one.  The service has improved!  Bigger restaurant...better than the crampy other location.  They need to open one near Aliante/215.  Rent is cheap!!!  They would do really well and there are lots of Hawaii people that live that side!!!  Best is red velvet and spam scramble!  Yummm! :-)"}
{"text":"***RUINED*** ordered and had a HAIR in food!! No offer to comp or discount and server came out 1 min later with a \"new\" plate...yeah right!!  Sorry but we won't be returning and I will be telling everyone I know of this bc that is just dirty and also a reflection of the lack of \"service\".  Too bad..but fellow yelpers need to know!!"}
{"text":"Ok I did not want to eat here.  A friend insisted we eat here.  I laughed when I read the menu \"Piglet\" i thought what a joke this place is, the waiter asked what can I get you?  I said, \"what the hell give the piglet\".  It was amazing.  Been back a couple times.  It's always great."}
{"text":"SO cheap and absolutely delicious food. Highly recommend making the drive out for some tasty bites! Babystacks is a cult favorite and I'm so glad my AirBnB was close enough to this place since I rarely ever make the drive off the strip if I'm always on it. 

* PARKING *
Located in a plaza with plenty of (unshaded) parking.

* WAIT TIMES *
On a Sunday brunch session, BabyStacks is certainly quite busy but none too much that we didn't get seated for longer than 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is rather small which is what largely amounts to the wait time but as I said, I went during peak hours and still got seated quickly.

* FOOD *

Strawberry & Nutella pancake stack: DELICIOUS!!! There were so many options that I wanted to try out but I'm so glad I ordered this because the pancakes were fluffy, the strawberries were a-plenty, the cream was soft, and the drizzled hazelnuts certainly made for a wonderful dining experience. 

Bacon eggs and cheese omelette: my boyfriend had this and quite enjoyed it as well. The omelette is cooked with the cheese melted over it and comes with an additional side (hash browns for him) and your choice of toast as well. Overall nothing spectacular but not a terrible choice either if you're looking to have this plate. 

* SERVICE *
Our server was sweet but doesn't seem to do her job very well when she's stacked with a full section. Our friend had ordered plain rice and she still managed to serve him garlic fried rice. Even after acknowledging the mistake, she still charged him for the garlic fried rice even though she said she wouldn't... Also, it took forever for us to receive our check so we didn't find it in our interest to argue our bill. 

* OVERALL *
I certainly enjoyed my meal here enough to warrant a second visit. And because babystacks is located off the strip, I know it won't ever get as busy and I can always pop in whenever I please. This is definitely a must for your visit in Vegas, so consider adding it to the bucket list!"}
{"text":"Love love love their food! Red velvet pancakes and kalhua pork grilled cheese are amazing. I tend to go during the week so service is usually good, although slow sometimes. Definitely recommend this location to friends looking for new breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! The many options and fa loves are amazing! My favorite is the Banana Foster pancakes; the red velvet are good as well. The service is good and the food is always the same as the first time' I recommend to anyone who was a sweet tooth and a taste for rich flavor!"}
{"text":"Extremely sweet!!! I love sweets but damn!! I had ordered some Nutella crepes thinking that they were gonna be well cooked and rich in flavor, first bite and wow.. no flavor! it was like a spoon of sugar in my mouth. The only good thing would be the hash browns. Overall, if you don't like sweets I do not recommend going to this place and by the way it's a bit pricey for something that's not even worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place the French honey toast are to die for...the only sad thing is that they are only open from 9am till noon ...way better than I hop staff is friendly...but food is delicious..."}
{"text":"Red Velvet pancakes!!!! If anyone knows me, they know that I love breakfast, and I love anything red velvet. So I had to come in to try the famous Red Velvet Pancakes that babystacks offers. OMG! They were so decadent! Anyone who wants to indulge on breakfast needs to come here. The portions that they give you are huge! Its definately enough for two people to share an order of anything here if they are not too hungry. The service is also top notch! My coffee was always full, and our server was always around when we needed him, but not enough where is was annoying. 

Make sure you visit this place if you're visiting and especially if you're a local!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows that I love breakfast. Also they would know that I love anything red velvet. Finding out that Baby Stacks cafe had red velvet pancakes was a dream come true. 

This cafe is a dream come true. Cute quaint little place with a family feel. The portions are huge, you can share if you like and still come out full. The red velvet pancakes are to die for. Light fluffy, red of course, covered in chocolate chips and whipped cream. Yum!

You can't go wrong with this place. The staff is friendly and attentive, I never had to flag someone down to get a refill on my coffee, and again has a nice homey feel while still maintaining excellent customer service standards. I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"So I've been to Vegas plenty of times and was sick of eating blah food for breakfast and waiting till dinner time to enjoy the buffet or a fancy restaurant, so I did my research and also asked my local familia for some great recommendations and this was one of them!

I was hooked from the moment my girl told me about a cafe that served red velvet pancakes! (shout out to my naning Mary Rose F.!) So I knew it was a must... I am the queen of breakfast... I love breakfast for lunch and/or dinner :)

So we got there closer to closing time (2pm on weekdays) because nobody vacationing in Vegas gets up earlier than noon (well, definitely not me!) so we beat the morning congestion and were seated promptly. I guess we got lucky because I've read that the wait can get pretty bad.

I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my sweetheart ordered the s'mores pancakes. DAMN! Both were sooo good. The red velvet pancakes were like eating perfectly flattened cupcakes smeared with cream cheese syrup and whipped cream! Each bite melted in my mouth... perfection!  

The service was great too! My coffee cup was always filled and we didn't wait too long for our food to come out. Also, they were very accommodating and  even though we showed up closer to closing time, they didn't rush us at all which I appreciated very much. 

Definitely a must-try especially if you're visiting from out of town. Yeah, so it's located on the other side of town from the strip but it's definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and my experience was not so good. I had high expectations due to the reviews but I must say, the food was mediocre and the service the same. Turkey sausage was disgusting  my buddies brkfst burrito was dry. Will not return. It's over rated and over priced. Save yourself the time and money, go to the cracked egg or egg works."}
{"text":"We went to this place for breakfast. I heard so many good things about the restaurant, we were very excited to go. After a long wait 45minutes on a weekend we were finally seated five of us not including the baby. It states all over the menu that a party of six automatically gets charged a gratuity of 18%. We did not order a meal for the ten month old baby, the waitress did not serve the ten month old baby but yet counted him as a whole person charging us the 18% gratuity. I did not notice this on the receipt until we got home. I had left her a twenty dollar tip not realizing that she was counting the baby to get the 18%. I should have checked my receipt before I left the restaurant that is my fault. I don't think a ten month old baby should be counted as a whole person to get a big tip. I have learned a expensive lesson to always check your receipt at restaurants. I don't like this kind of business. Needless to say that I will not be dinning at BabyStacks cafe again."}
{"text":"The food was good!! I got the steak and eggs also comes with pancakes! Definitely a good amount of food for the charge. Definitely would go back to try out different pancakes."}
{"text":"PROS:
- Red velvet pancakes.  Order this.
- Cream cheese syrup.  YOLO.
- Adobo fried rice
- The waitress that helped us was friendly and attentive

CONS:
- This place is 250 miles away from where I live.  Lol

TIPS:
- The adobo fried rice is good enough for 2 people, so ask for an extra plate
- Sriracha will evolve the adobo fried rice to another level.  Trust."}
{"text":"Ordered the piglet skillet, with the buttermilk pancakes.. Quick Carlos was on point this am.. Great service, great breakfast. Calm, laid back atmosphere, accommodating. Get there early for a good seat, not a really large place. Been to both locations and the signature dishes are all pretty good.. I'd recommend for a great early am breakfast, keep it light and keep it moving!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Well rounded menu, very large variety of pancakes. Everyone was happy with their meal. Huevos Rancheros were a hit with the hubby. I enjoyed the specialty of the house, adobo chicken rice omelette. 

Service was friendly, quick and accurate! Prices are good and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We came here because the menu looked so impressive!!  Over 20 different kinds of pancakes. However, don't let that fool you. The \"bacon\" pancakes had no bacon inside, just on top. The \"s'mores\" pancake had no marshmallows in it, the \"mocha\" pancakes were very bitter.  They also nickel and dime you for everything... skimp on toppings and charge extra for more sauce.  Not impressed when a restaurant does that. Also, waitress barely came around.  When a restaurant skimps on things, it leaves a very negative impression.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Always full and service is good, they're always aware of our orders. I always get steak and eggs and maybe adobo fried rice omelette. My only thing is 2/5 times my steak wasn't cooked even like on the left side is medium well so no pink around the meat but on the right side is medium rare which has a bit of pink. I usually order medium rare so it's juicy. Just a small thing I've noticed."}
{"text":"I have never given a bad review before; the food was good, our server was nice. I was in a party of 6 we arrived at Baby Stacks with half our party. I asked to be seated but a rude woman named Julie told us that the rest of our party had to be here even though their were available tables. She then gave us an attitude and seated 3 parties on the available tables and here is what upsets me. Two of the 3 parties said the rest of their group will be arriving shortly and she then said that's fine lets get all of you seated. JULIE allowed not one but two incomplete parties get seated at a table with no reservation just walk ins. When the rest of our party arrived we ended up waiting 45 minutes and Julie was extremely rude to everyone in our party she didn't give us an estimated wait time all she said was when a table opens up will seat you, but she didn't she instead seated 3 smaller parties, then when she finally seated us she yelled my name, threw our menus on the table and didn't even look at us, Didn't mention that our server would be with us shortly or anything she instead walked away and left the building. I don't know what her problem was but you alone JULIE are the reason why I will never come here again"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and they have so many menu options. I tried the kalua pig grilled cheese and it's the one menu item I always order. It's filled with so much meat and cheese in just the perfect ratio. The pancakes no matter what version you go with is always light and fluffy. My go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Yes, the red velvet pancakes are awesome--make sure you ask for extra cream cheese \"syrup\". But....there is no way I could eat a stack of them for breakfast! 

So we went at lunch time and ordered a stack for dessert! I will admit that they were just the tiniest bit dry but once you pour on that delicious cream cheese syrup, it didn't matter. We thought they might have been just a tiny bit better if they had mini chocolate chips in them (ala red velvet bundts at Nothing Bundt Cakes). We shared the Kalua pulled pork grilled cheese which was solid. Really good pulled pork with muenster and cheddar grilled on sourdough.  The fries were crispy but my son said they reminded him of the Ore Ida frozen fries that are marketed as \"extra crispy fast food fries\". He's right, that's totally what the fries are like. But not terrible.

Youngest kid had a kids meal of scrambled egg, bacon, and hash browns with a s'more pancake on the side. Pretty standard fare except for the amazing pancake. It's a pancake with marshmallows, melts chocolate chips, graham cracker crumbs and marshmallow fluff.  So yum.

We went on a weekday close to 11am and had to wait close to 30 minutes. I'm sure weekends are crazy. Our server was great (and cute!) and very apologetic when our red velvet pancakes were delayed due to another server swiping them. 

We'll be back every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I tried to schedule a reservation but they don't do reservations. I waited 10 minutes but it was worth the wait. I went with my girls and the customer service was friendly and the atmosphere is fun. We really enjoyed the food. Our waiter was Juan and he was the best. I loved his enthusiasm. The food was just to die for. Definitely would come back here. It does get very crowded but I see why."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!! Let me stress....AAAMMMMAAAZZZZIIINNNGGG! My friends have been here a couple times before and raved about this place so it was our first stop after landing. We ordered 2 Loco Mocos, 1 Lolo Rick Adobo, 2 Macadamia Nut Short Stacks, & 1 Banana Foster Short Stack. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING tastes like a slice of heaven. Think Sarah Michelle Gellar cooking effect in Simply Irresistible. The food puts you in a joyful trance where the taste is so amazing you cannot find the proper words. I never would have thought to smother eggs in gravy layered above beef patties and garlic rice. It was savory. Then you mix the sweetness of the banana foster pancakes. Man oh man! Life doesn't get much better. The waitress was nice. The only negative is it too a while for us to get our food. People who were seated right before us and even some afterwards not only had their food way before us but by the time we got ours they were finished. We are already making plans to return. Also they have a good selection of music flowing through the speakers. I normally do not pay attention to that but there was one song that got my attention. I am not sure of the name but it was reggae style."}
{"text":"Before we finished our Babystacks from yesterday, it had already been decided that we would be making a repeat the following day. The only thing that changed was the location. The food at Babystacks is so good that it haunts you in your dreams. It also causes memories of happy times spent eating to dance around in your brain. If you are not a foodie it will convert you into a foodie. I was already a foodie though. Today's line up consisted of 2 Loco Mocos, Baby Chick Omelette, Seasoned Potatoes, 2 Banana Foster Short stacks, and Butterscotch Short stack. Once again it was all a hit. I tried to deviate from the loco mock and was all set to order the Portuguese sausage and eggs but I couldn't sit back and watch my friend enjoy her loco moco. I needed my eggs coated in savory gravy. Seriously, next visit I am trying other stuff because it is all guaranteed to taste good anyway. I swear they have baby angels in the kitchen sprinkling little dashes of heaven on the plates. The baby chick omelette and butterscotch pancakes were great as was the seasoned potatoes. It is always good when a restaurant can add just the right amount of seasoning without making the food taste salty. Now you maybe wondering why 4 stars instead of 5...let me catch you up to speed. The service: 5. The food: 2375. The 4: a result of this location charging for every little thing and refusal to split checks. For the baby chick omelette, my friend asked for salsa and was told it would be an additional charge. The location yesterday did not charge and brought 2 different types for her to use. Even IHOP provides free salsa as does any other restaurant I can think of. Also, what is up with not splitting checks? People dine out all the time and split checks. Not everyone carries cash and these days mostly everyone has a card. Not allowing the option to split checks is an inconvenience. Alright I have said my 2 cents.

In conclusion, Babystacks is addicting. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Visited Babycakes after purchasing their groupon offer.  My favorite breakfast place is Egg Works so they had a lot to live up to. The verdict? Thumbs down. 

The eggs benedict was terrible. It was overcooked and hollandaise sauce was bleh. Seemed like maybe it was made from a powder mix? It was definitely missing something. The seasoned potatoes were okay but salty for my taste.

Also ordered an omelet that had veggies and a variety of meats. Once again, lack luster. I felt I could have made it at home and for the price, it was smaller in proportion to what Egg Works serves. The hash browns that were on my plate were probably the best thing but once again, small in portion.

We also ordered a small stack of plain buttermilk pancakes. This was probably the best thing we ate at our table.

Although I wanted to like Babycakes because of their cute logo and reviews, I must sadly say that I will probably never be eating breakfast here again."}
{"text":"I was just there trying to get seated 10/26/2017 12pm this dude asked me how many I said 2 I asked him to seat me he said no it's against company policy! What the hell is that all about so I said no just seat me he refused until my other guy showed. That's bull shit so I left and Mi Mi's sat me immediately! I will never go back there!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes with Cream Cheese Frosting.

If any other review on this profile are calling these \"the shizz\", there's a reason.  I'm joining that chorus of voices because this is more like a dessert....  A dessert filled with AWESOME!

I had Eggs Benedict to go with them, and it was also pretty delicious.  Basically, everything I tried here was pretty darn good,

A few things to note: The place is inanely busy, the wait takes a fairly long time, and they close in the early afternoon.

I can understand the wait regarding the quality of food.  It's worth the wait, but come early.  The wait was about 30 minutes or so, but they keep a pretty tight schedule in making sure you get seated before of within that time.  The staff remains friendly, and attentive from seating to getting refills.  A little crowded with a short dining window, but man, was it ever worth it.

But really, if there's any reason to go, it's those red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese frosting.  Any other point I could possibly make is pretty much moot after eating those.

(That was the highlight of my breakfast, if your couldn't tell.)"}
{"text":"After waiting for 20 minutes for a table, my spot was given away, because my mother in law couldn't get in from the parking lot fast enough for the teen something in charge of seating. Then she abruptly turned a sign around stating their seating policy. Hope someone is that disrespectful to her someday."}
{"text":"Could not have been treated worse! Hostess was awful. Didn't even stay! Their policy of not seating you until everyone is there apparently includes when elderly family is in front of the window struggling to walk."}
{"text":"I love this location! Every time I have come here there has been a bit of a line, but they for such a small place, and for so many people, they really do get you in and out in a flash. They don't mess around here.
First off, pancakes. This is the place to go to try some sweet cakes of different varieties. My favorites are the Red Velvet and the holiday Chocolate Mint. 
Skillets here are really good, but that could just be because the home potatoes are crunchy and well seasoned. 
Now, crepes. Oh my, the Nutella crepe with strawberries here is to die for. The crepe is so light and airy, and they do not over due it on the Nutella, so it's not a heavy dish. You can get one, or many. You will want many.
Service has always be top notch, and like I said before you are in and out in no time. Though there are other locations, this one stands out to me as the best based on the food quality and the service."}
{"text":"First off, this location is HUGE compared to the others. So, you have a good chance of getting in. But not always. Wait times here are longer than the others, both for the seats and the food. Even when there isn't many people inside, you will wait. 
I have been here three times now, and I did a take out, and each time I have been less than impressed. Perhaps I will always hold the first location as the best, but really, this one is alright.
The crepes here are not good. Chewy and bland, really a let down. The quality of the skillets and pancakes has been hit or miss. One time my stack was under cooked in the middle, very gooey. 
Service is slow, and the benches are really not made right. They are not comfortable at all. 
Overall it's a good fix when you don't feel like driving to another one, but if you are really in need, just make the drive."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the wait stinks!!!   I don't know if I would wait more than an hour but I must admit the food is delicious and once seated the kitchen gets your food out quick!

We went for breakfast and we ordered 2 entrees and then got a side of pancakes.  I got the Portugese sausage with 2 eggs and rice with a side of red velvet pancakes.  Hubby got 2 scrambled eggs with bacon and potatoes with a side of strawberry pancakes.  The sausage was to die for and so were the pancakes.  I brought home my extra pancake so I could have it for dessert!!!  The rice was a bit of a disappointment as it was a little dry and hard.  Potatoes also just ok.  The bacon was nice and thick and they did the eggs just right.  I'm looking forward to going back...  There is much more on this menu that I am looking forward to trying."}
{"text":"Food was great. Very clean. Staff very helpful. Very family oriented. Definately a must go in vegas. Well worth it"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst meal my husband and I have had in a long time. We ordered an omelette and pancakes.  First, if you are going to call yourself Babystacks your pancakes should be amazing.  These pancakes were like eating cardboard.  My husband ordered the plain buttermilk pancakes and I ordered the carrot cake pancakes.  His were cold and burnt.  Don't know how that happens.  I think it could be because they use frozen pancakes and then just re-heat them.  That is certainly what they taste like.  As for the omelettes, they were rubbery and the bacon in it tasted horrible.  It almost tasted like they put liquid smoke in the omelette.  We have eaten at the Babystacks in Summerlin which was terrific, so we were excited about one in Henderson.  Unfortunately it was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for my childhood breakfast comfort food, I will take myself to Babystacks. I'm so thankful that I don't need to drive away from centennial hills to satisfy my Hawaiian food cravings!

The restaurant is bright and clean, but the space is too small for the crowd they attract. 

I love Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice! I wish they made sticky rice 'cause that's the best kind!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait... and there will probably be a long one. This place has some of the best food I've ever had. Service is always great, staff is friendly, and I've never had any problems. Food comes out pretty quickly, correct - even with custom options, and hot. 

I continue to come here because I am obsessed with their Red Velvet Pancakes and insist on sharing them with the world, one breakfast at a time. I make it a point to take visitors here. Weekdays are much less busy, but I don't mind waiting an hour for a plate full of red velvet heaven. 

I've had a number of their other breakfast options (various pancake flavors and crepes) and so far everything has been incredible. Thumbs up to a consistently tasty and delicious breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"WAY TO END ONE HELL OF A VEGAS TRIP!

Hit up the spot on a Monday around brunch time. They estimated a 10-15 minute wait but we actually got a seat within 3-5 mins.

Ordered the banana cream pancakes, garlic fried rice, adobo chicken omelette and kalua pig rice. WOWWWW talk about DELICIOUS! I've had the banana cream pancakes before and I actually like them more than the red velvet pancakes, not saying the red velvet pancakes aren't good because they also deserve 5 stars but the I just LOVEEEE banana cream anything! The food was quick, delicious and so original! I wish I could have taken food home or wish there was a spot like this in Cali.

Definitely a must if you can get your ass off the strip! Reasonably priced too!

Total spent $free.99
(Bill was a little over $30 but my friends got me)"}
{"text":"Baby stacks cafe is an amazing place for breakfast! My schedule is reversed where I sleep in the morning due to my job so this place pretty much accommodates me for dinner if you want to say lol. Anyways the hospitality here is awesome! Im huge on hospitality! I usually get everything here to go since I just get done with the gym n I wanna just head home. I will tip even since I take out because their staff is awesome!

Lilly helped me out this Morning and she is such a sweetheart! Very helpful and very nice! Thank you baby stacks and staff. Keep up the amaZing job! :)"}
{"text":"Dude whenever a friend want to grab breakfast and I'm not being picky about my weight I take them here whenever I have somebody who comes in to see me from Ohio or Chicago I take them here seriously red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting...or the orange Julius pancakes they have a lemon ricotta pancakes they have Smore's pancakes they have peanut butter and jelly pancakes I mean anything your little heart desires they have!!!!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the Orange Creamsicle pancakes and I added a side of corn beef hash to absorb last nights booze rage fest sess.  So good!  Love this place!   I love how many different flavor options of pancakes they have... but Creamsicle is the save the day ALWAYS!"}
{"text":"Costantly good food. I have been there 4 times and have yet to be disappointed. Large menu  of both sweet and saver foods. They close at 2 and be prepared to wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for bfast this morning. All people in your party must be here before being seated. Luckily at 0900 it was just getting busy, we did not have to wait for a table, although there was a large party who was seated ahead of us.

It took quite a bit of time for our order to be taken, and then some time before our food came. My friend had coffee (refillable), eggs & bacon and Cinnabon pancakes. I had spam and eggs (no eggs, substitute for potatoes), garlic fried rice, and regular pancakes. I did try my friends pancakes and the frosting was delicious! The entire front of the menu was basically all pancakes, if you're into that, this is the place for you. The regular pancakes were ok. They were a little on the dark side, not as fluffy as I would expect. The garlic fried rice reminded me of home cooking. Spam was spam--it's always good! 

Overall, if you're a pancake lover -- you have to try this place out because of the tons of diff options. I thought it was a good breakfast place. And I would definitely come back if someone invites me, but don't think this would be a top choice for me for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ordered carrot cakes and red velvet.. both were amazing! Carrot cake had a lot of flavor and red velvet was similar to chocolate cake but very fluffy! Cream cheese icing on both was very sweet but flavorful in light doses.. very good! Nervous for my figure that this place is around the corner from our place!"}
{"text":"OMG deeeeelish!!! We had came to eat here because we had seen the reviews and man o man this place is so good.. We were so mad we had just found out about it and we're moving.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place, but I have to say that the inability to split checks makes me never go here anymore. My friends and I used to meet up here all the time for breakfast but it's just SUCH a HASSLE to not be able to pay for our food individually. It's so much easier just to chose a different place to meet up. PLEASE CHANGE THIS POLICY!! I miss my red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing !!! Dn t go for the lemon ricotta pancake but pick the red velvet ones  and you won't be disappointed . The eggs Benedict were out of this world!!! Omg! Will go back! On a side note, guys go hang out there.... Servers are cute ;))"}
{"text":"The mistake my boyfriend made was leaving me alone with the red velvet pancakes when he went to the restroom....I don't have much of a sweet tooth but the fluffy red velvet pancakes sprinkled with chocolate chips combined with the cream cheese frosting were calling my name and I ended up devouring the dish before he got back to the table....I did leave him a few bites =)  

I prefer this location over the original one since it seems to be larger...and we didn't have to wait for a table when we went for brunch on Saturday.  I like the menu options with the standard breakfast fare and a large selection of Hawaiian fusion breakfast items like the adobo omelette, loco moco, spam omelette, kahlua pig eggs benedict, and portuguese sausage.  They also have a large variety of pancake options, all which are cooked perfectly.  Babystacks has breakfast food down to a tee....I've tried both the adobo omelette and loco moco and I'm a fan of both! 

So if you are ever in need of a good brunch place, this is a must try type of establishment...and don't forget to order the FULL stack of the red velvet pancakes...it's like the Lay's potato chip slogan, betcha can't eat just one!...so probably best to order extra so you can share."}
{"text":"I always come here every Sunday morning for breakfast with my hubby and this place never disappoints, i'm from Hawaii and the music and vibes here remind me of home. i always get the mexican skillet with the Chocolate chip Pancakes. the upgrade is such a great deal! the food is excellent, and the servers are all nice, the whole staff actually. I will continue to come as a weekly routine!"}
{"text":"Not sure to give this a 4 star or just a 3......
After driving 15 min from the strip and being told of a 45 min wait we decided to wait. After watching tables staying open for over 20 min I asked why no one was being seated and they told me they have 2 large groups they were saving them for so they could push them together. 15 min later they were able to seat the first group of 10  This place is just way too small for groups! I would suggest having one area for groups if any.  Our wait turned out to be over an hour! I watched several people walk in and back out. 
I will say the food is very good! LOVED the Red Velvet pancakes....just not sure the wait was worth it!"}
{"text":"Little bit of a wait, but where isn't there one on a saturd a morning. Had a couple specials with some short stack specials. Great variations in flavor for the food and the stacks, definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Wanna make it 10 stars. This place always appears on our list of Las Vegas trip plans. And then we force others to promise to visit as well. You can't say you've had the best pancakes of your life, unless you've visted BabyStacks. It's that simple.

Once you visit, you'll already be planning your next stop because our bodies aren't capable of eating all the brilliant selections they've put on their menu.

Where to start? Kahlua pork eggs benedict. Red Velvet pancakes which the family always shares for dessert. But you can never go wrong with any flavor of pancake which catches your eye."}
{"text":"Everyone has been talking about Babystacks lately. I just had to go try it. Boy I was glad that I did. It is in a busy shopping center but plenty of parking. When I first walked in I could see how crowded and people waiting for seats. They told us about a 15-20 minute wait which we figured wasn't too bad. At exactly 15 minutes our table was ready so I was happy.

I went with a egg white skillet, with pepper jack cheese, turkey sausage, tomatoes potatoes, avocado on the side and some buttermilk pancakes. Everything was cooked right and they kept my coffee cup filled the whole time. I definitely see my self going back. Pancakes were good though next time I will have to try their specialty ones to see all the hubub. My girlfriend and her dad liked their breakfast as well."}
{"text":"Second best thing about this place, number one being the food is Joey our waiter. He was so funny and not bad on the eyes plus he was a great waiter, kept our waters full and our food came out quickly. Side note, the water cups here are huge, like HUGE which I love because I drink my water like a fish. 

I've been here a few times and always get the same thing, loco moco..because you can never go wrong with the loco moco, its delicious. But, today I felt a little adventurous and wanted to try something new. So, I tired the Hawaiian benedict. No regrets, the Hawaiian benne was bomb. Who would have thought Hawaiian bread an spam with gravy would have been so great. At the same time, I feel like spam with anything would make it great. Because Spam is great its \"Sizzle Pork and MMM\" cant go wrong with that slogan.

Also got the orange marmalade pancakes and my best friend got the banana nut pancakes. My goodness, both were sooooooooo gooood! I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but I could eat those orange pancakes all day every day any time of the day.

Place was super clean and everyone staff member I came across was friendly and had a smile on their face. I will definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"Holy YUM! We entered the slightly too cold cafe and were kindly greeted and promptly sat at a seat we preferred next to the window. Right away I was able to get some coffee and water in me and soon after our server came to take our order. What pleasant people who work there! The banana cream pie pancakes were insanely good, and I don't even like pancakes. The Mexican skillet was on point. They kept my coffee coming without a problem. I shared the skillet with an upgraded pancake w another person and we were both full and satisfied. The decor is kitschy and cute in a home sweet home kind of way. I would so go there again and you should too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is great! Like omg
Great. The prices are more than reasonable and it's pretty much my fav breakfast place. Only thing i find annoying is how busy it is on the weekend hahha u do wait a while for a table but that just goes to show how great this place is . We live across street so we will be coming often"}
{"text":"I went here with one of my best friends the other week since she's been talking about it for quite some time now. I was visiting Vegas so I thought it would be good to try it out since I've heard so much about it. 

I ended up ordering two items since we decided to share them both.  I ordered the Huntington as well as the red velvet pancakes. The Huntington was a very tasty omelette that had the perfect mix of ingredients. The avocado on top was a nice touch as well. 

The red velvet pancakes were delicious as well. I loved the fuchsia color that is used, which gives it a really nice appearance. They use cream cheese syrup that goes PERFECTLY with the meal. I think the red velvet pancakes are a must.

I'm excited to come back and try more things but the red velvet pancakes will always be ordered!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of people that swear by Babystacks and their love for red velvet pancakes. 

I've been to their original location on a few occasions with this being my first one at this one. Good taste the same as the other location.  

I usually go with the red velvet pancakes and the adobo omelette. Red velvet pancakes to be honest are ok. Pancake by itself is a bit bland to me but when you mix it with the topping, it makes it taste much, much better. 

A lot of people love the adobo omelette as well. It's not bad. It satisfies a craving for some who get that.

Other than that, I give this place an A-Ok. Won't be the last time I visit."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were good. I got a short stack. It was a good amount since I was getting egg whites. I wouldn't order a side of fruit because the fruit tasted old. My husband got the Santa Fe ... It was mediocre but not too bad. The meat was dry. 

As for the service... It was less than expected. I counted 6 staff members and 3 tables with customers (us being the third) no one came to our table for at least 7 mins to take our drinks. I had to call someone over. No one came to refill our coffee when requested until I had to ask for it again. We asked for butter on our toast and no one ever brought that over until, once again, we asked for it a second time. Our waiter looked like he was miserable...

The only reason why I'm writing this review is because the one other time I went to baby stacks at a different location, this was no my experience. I'm pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"The Place: It's very a cute place. Cool ambiance but kinda crowded 'cause they're popular. 
The Service: had to wait 30 to 35 mins but it's understandable. Expect that if you're going in a popular restaurant. Don't be cranky. The service is fine. My server is kinda took long to get my order. The two guys after me was assisted first. When I got my order, my server forgot to give me my spoon and fork. So I waited again for someone that I can ask for it. 
The Food: I ordered Loco Moco and S'mores Pancake. I love their Loco Moco. The gravy is really good. Better than the other restaurant that I'd tried. But the s'mores pancake is not what I expected. Just like a plain pancake nothing special. It's just have marshmallows toppings. 
The Price: It's very affordable. Not too pricy. For my order, Loco Moco with the side of 2pcs of pancakes. It's like $11. 

Gonna come back for their Loco Moco. And gonna try their other pancakes."}
{"text":"We were thinking of a new place to dine.  It was early so breakfast was the meal to be had.  So, Babystacks Cafe  was the call that was made.  

We walk in and the place was packed.  I'd say that's a good sign.  We put in our names and were seated within 5 minutes.

We sit down, look over the menu and our waitress comes over to take our drink order.  Then comes back and takes our meal order.  She ordered the 2 egg breakfast and I got the Country Benedict.  Everything was great.  The gravy wasn't smothering and overpowering.  The hashbrowns were crispy as well.  That's all I was looking for in breakfast.  So, I was happy with BabyStacks."}
{"text":"Amazing, quick, delicious. Ellie was so sweet and helpful! She had everything ready for me to pick up. Very polite atmosphere and warm service. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a bunch of times and each time has been a wait. Waiting is understandable. I mean, if it's busy...it's busy. One can't control the wait. 

The bad part about waiting and waiting is...you'd expect your food to be spectacular. So sorry, but it isn't. They do have a spectacular option for pancakes. I won't lie...I sure love their banana fosters. However, it is what it is. Nothing spectacular. You got your bananas...you got your foster. Lol.

The lolo Rick's adobo fried rice has failed us each time only reason we've been back a few times and ordered the same thing each time is because we were hoping each experience was a fluke due to the business. Dry, bland, and the distribution into the omelette seemed poorly executed. At the beginning of the omelette it's all rice then when you get to the end then out comes the meat. 

Kids order typical.spam and eggs so nothing much to review because it is what it is. Spam...and eggs.

They don't seat you unless your entire party is present. So even if you're waiting on just 1 person, sorry...keep on waiting and watch all the people who have come way after you being seated to then having to wait for a table to open once your 1 person arrives. 

Overall, I think this place is highly over-rated. However, I would.pick this place over an Ihop or Dennys hands-down despite cheaper options on said restaurants. But since we aren't much of eating out for breakfast kine of fam anyway, it isn't a type of place we'd become frequent customers regardless. It has to be something really spectacular to turn us into breakfast folks. Service has also been slow. Slow for refill, slow to even ask for our drinks, slow to order, just slow.

It is a great option to have this place up in the Northwest for those who are into breakfast menus, though.

Definitely kid friendly but because this place is always filled up and the lobby can get congested....skip the stroller. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband had the huntington omelet & I had the spinach eggs benedict with a side of portuguese sausage The meal totaled about $25. Yes the food was good but nothing to rave about because I'm not a pancake kind of girl. However something was missing. Ambiance, service, decor I honestly can't put my finger on it Enthusiastically speaking Babystacks did not hit the mark."}
{"text":"Such a great place to have breakfast! The service was great, the food was delicious and everything is very decently priced. The honey French toast was great and the spinach egg benedict is a must! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful with big portions. Love their pancakes and crepes. There ared also house specialties that are very good as well."}
{"text":"Babycakes, where have you been all my life?
I heard about the amazing red velvet pancakes from a friend, but I've never been a huge red velvet cake fan.  Imagine my excitement when I learned that they had s'more, and carrot cake pancakes.  Imagine my excitement double when I saw that they also had white chocolate macademia nut pancakes on their daily specials board.  
The pancakes were excellent, and I really thought it couldn't get any better...until I took a bite of the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the pulled pork, and cabbage were amazing.
My expectations were pretty high, but everything tasted twice as good as it sounded.
The only downside is that the restaurant is really small.  There was a 1 hour wait when we got there at 11:30am on Sunday.  By 12:30-1pm it slowed down considerably.  I will probably just try going later next time."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best pancakes especially the red velvet pancakes. Good staff, and quick service. Place is a bit small so u will have to wait atleast 15 min"}
{"text":"First trip to this Babystacks (been to Smoke Ranch a few times). This location is crowded and only has 1 restroom for a larger crowd. We (party of 2) were seated within 20 minutes at the smallest, smooshiest table in the restaurant. Our waitress was awesome and constantly apologized for our wait and our table. We ordered 2 breakfast \"skillets\" and pancakes (peanut butter & chocolate and rocky road). The skillets are not skillets at all. The veggies are not cooked with the eggs & our veggies were raw. The serving sizes seem smaller than the other location. Pancakes were still delish!! Service & the 'cakes are what pushed this from a 3 to 4 star. Might add this to our breakfast rotation, but we have to figure out their down times for sure."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Las Vegas this has been our go to place. The red velvet pancakes are delicious and so is everything else on the menu. Service has always been top notch. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  The pancakes were delicious and so was everything else (hash browns, eggs).  We went back the next day to have breakfast again.  Small place, but we had no problem getting a table (or counter seating) on either day."}
{"text":"Their pancakes seem like they might be too sweet but they are really good. The orange juice and iced tea had a weird taste though"}
{"text":"Great food , great service, great atmosphere. Well deserved of a 5 . Our server Dani was outside . She was very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Bookmarked forever.  Read a ton of reviews.  It's like a group mantra.  RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP.

We were so excited to finally come here and it lived up to the hype.  Got the large stack of RVP and an order of their homemade corned beef hash which came with eggs and home fries along with a short stack of S'mores.  Is this breakfast or dessert?

Holy pancake overload, Batman!  Everything was delicious.  My wife said it was the best corn beef hash she had ever eaten.  

We finished everything and went into a  total food coma.  3pm turned into nap time and I don't think we had dinner that night.  Not sure if it was the carb overload or the sugar crash or both but wow.

I'm gonna do something eggy next time with a short stack so it doesn't kill me for the rest of the day.  This place is definitely worth the trip though.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best breakfasts I've had in Vegas!  We ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - wrapped in egg, it was packed with awesome flavor.  Kalua eggs benedict had the welcome addition of Kalua pork.  We also got a short stack of Red velvet pancakes.  These were rich, fluffy, and incredibly tasty but i'm so glad we only ordered a short stack to go with our other two meals.  I tend to like my brunches savory with some sweetness.  Any more pancake would have been overkill!  Will definitely be returning to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"If not for the hype, I would have given it 4 stars but I was expecting better and didn't get it. I ordered the s'mores pancakes, maybe should have gone with the red velvet as they are the most popular. S'mores were alright, my biggest complaint was not enough chocolate & marshmallow In the batter. My gf ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, they were also good but definitely not great"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me! The staff is always attentive & the food absolutely delicious! I used to go to the location on Flamingo/Buffalo but sometimes the \"wait\" could be a bit long - so I make the trek to Henderson on Stephanie/Sunset and I walk right in!"}
{"text":"Did a skillet with chocolate chip pancakes and strawberries and hubby did steak and eggs with garlic rice and banana pancakes. Everything was phenomenal! Including service. Josh was a great server who anticipated every need, recommended great food and was extremely friendly. We are new regulars after finally trying this place!"}
{"text":"Excelente seevicio, muy amables meseros y la comida esta super.  variedad de platos, muy ricooo."}
{"text":"Great place. Leftovers aren't so great and the loco moco tasted a bit off; however the breakfast food there is delicious and very cheap especially with a large group."}
{"text":"RED VELVET PANCAKES, 'nuff said. I have been to this location many times and I love it, the service and the food are both on point. I am a regular of many of their locations and I have no complaints other than the wait time, because everyone loves this place and the locations are all pretty small."}
{"text":"First time..The red velvet pancakes were very nasty, they look appealing but taste bland, not to mention the cream cheese looks like male secretions but the customer service was OK, and the postage's and sausage was the better part, smh Not at all impressed with the food, my other half said the biscuits and gravy were DisGusting , not chance it. Good luck  I won't be a return customer...."}
{"text":"Meh. Breakfast, so simple yet so few get it right. 
The service was good, not enough napkins, trying to save a buck. 
The food itself was ok, sausage wasn't cooked all the way. Pancakes, I make them at home from scratch and use real maple syrup and sometimes the really sweet stuff so I'm like a connoisseur of sorts, were ok, needed more salt, the pancake syrup was tasteless and sweet. 
For the price will not be back. When will the open an Original Sunrise Cafe in Summerlin is anyone's guess. Meanwhile I'll keep making breakfast at home."}
{"text":"I almost hate to recommend this restaurant because it may make them too busy! Their food is amazing, service is always great and if you are a breakfast lover this place is a CAN'T MISS!"}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast meal that had the Hawaiian chili mmmmm! My husband and I love this place only been once, and it was really good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The food is always yummy, and the service is on par. I see many complaints about the wait times, but you usually get seated before your est. wait time. This location is very small, so be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes. I've never had a bad experience here, and I always recommend it."}
{"text":"French toast were off the hook! And the Red Velvet pancakes  yummm !! Im craving them again lol! Definitely a great breakfast spot to try"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot in Vegas! Everything was extremely delicious, and the waitress was amazing! When a place can satisfy my kids and hubby's taste buds- you know the experience was pretty outstanding! Banana Fosters pancakes, I'll see you soon"}
{"text":"Loving coming here because the food has yet to let me down. 
I bounce back and forth between two items. Cookie butter French toast plus strawberries or the two egg breakfast with red velvet pancakes.
This is the only breakfast place (besides ihop) in this area so the wait is always abit long. 
They give military discount!!!!!
And the servers are always nice. 
Coffee is to be desired (I don't mind it) 
By far our kids favorite place to eat. Great for families.
Don't be in a rush because they are busy.
Take out is available."}
{"text":"We read the great reviews here and decided to give it a try and were somewhat disappointed. Our server was super sweet I think they just happened to be understaffed because I didn't see any other servers except for her and I heard her mention to another table that they only had one cook. It just took a very long time to place our order and get the food. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedicts was not runny enough although it did have a good flavor still. We also had an omelette that needed to be remade as it didn't have any cheese in it and it was also very dry with only a couple pieces of ham. My huevos rancheros was excellent. So yea it was a little bit of an underwhelming experience just because I had high expectations based on the great reviews but I think we just caught them on an off day. I would still come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"The red velvet & the German chocolate pancakes are the bombbbbbb!!! Great portion sizes & reasonable prices. Service is quick !"}
{"text":"Do people actually drive all the way up here to eat?  This would be better if it was just a neighborhood joint, but it's certainly not worth driving up to the area to eat at, as the food is just ordinary and not amazing.  There's so many other better places in town to go to, like Bagel Cafe and the Original Pancake House.

After confirming that the red velvet pancakes did not have beet juice for coloring but red food coloring, which has carmine dye in it that come from bugs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal), my husband and I sampled the banana pancakes, and the bacon pancakes.  All were bland in flavor, as the banana pancakes had very little banana, and my husband's bacon pancakes had just 3 tiny pieces of bacon in them.  He was extremely underwhelmed and annoyed.

There were other little things that I found annoying.  The potatoes were not that good and were riddled with seasoned salt.  They looked like the egg works potatoes that I hate so much.  I love big huge chunky pieces of real potato that is soft and velvety inside and crispy on the outside, like Beach Cafe does.  Sausage was the same stuff I could have gotten at a cheap buffet and cooked in the same manner.  

Overall just a very ordinary experience."}
{"text":"Yes, the red velvet pancake is a must get!  

There's a bit of a line if you go at like 10 or 11 but by Noon we only waited 5 minutes.  

I ordered Kalua Pig eggs benny. Solid, but the sauce was a little too thick but it didn't prevent me from eating every bite.  The slow cooked pork was amazing!! 

BF ordered a skillet thing that came with buttermilk pancake and the nice staff let us replace them with red velvet ones.  

OMG! I don't like red velvet but the pancakes made me reconsider with the cheesecake frosting on the side!

Sadly they do not make ice coffee.  Vegas is hot, not sure why other places don't make ice coffee either?  They did offer to give me ice and put in my hot coffee but it's not the same =("}
{"text":"I love this place. The red velvet pancakes are second to none and ever other dish is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Food was delicious, and our server Kayla was exceptional. Her smiling face and personality made our whole breakfast!!  Kudos to your establishment for hiring this gem of a person.  Give her a raise!!!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were good...they are pretty sweet (like cake). Also the cream cheese syrup that comes with it is extremely sweet. I liked it better with the whipped cream.
I also got eggs and roasted potatoes. Pretty tasty. Just a warning: I asked for my toast to be without butter and I got one without butter...but with margarine on it. I also asked for no butter on my eggs but it was oily so I guess specifically ask for dry if you don't want any type of oils on there."}
{"text":"Went to visit Babycakes again and wow i love this place. Usually I just get an omelet w/red velvet pancakes which is always delicious, but yesterday I had the french toast, OMG it was amazing. The service and food is superb! A must try for sure :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food here. Usually always busy but service is pretty quick. They have a lot of different pancakes to choose from and their piglet skillet is great (potatoes, eggs, ham, and bacon)"}
{"text":"After coming to this location frequently after it first opened a couple years ago (fact check is required because I can't remember off the top of my head when they opened), I figured it was time to finally leave my review. 

This location is easily accessible off Blue Diamond and Cimarron. Parking can be slim pickings depending on when you go since it's shared with nearby stores, and since Babystacks is normally pretty packed all the time.

Just like all their other locations, besides their specialty pancakes and their Hawaiian/Filipino-inspired dishes listed on their menu, they also have off-menu offerings which are constantly changing depending on the seasons and holidays. One thing that I have noticed they've done a little differently with their food is that their omelettes are LOADED with cheese on top. As much as I love cheese, sometimes it's a little too much, in my opinion. Different strokes, different folk. 

Also similar to their sister locations (with the exception of the northwest location on Durango), the space is a little small & seating is pretty limited, so expect to wait a little bit to be seated (again, depending on when you go).

Overall, Babystacks remains to be my favorite go-to spot for brunch and red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Friendly service clean place but it gets busy.  They give alot for ur money and the food is delicious.  Kid friendly place which is good alot of dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"There is a breakfast cafe in Hawaii called Cinnamons, and this by far is the closest thing to it I have found here in Vegas, it transports me back to Hawaii whenever I eat here, and get the Red Velvet pancakes or Spam and eggs or Eggs Benedict which is my favorite by far. And just like Hawaii you have to get there early to get a table LOL"}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop for a quick bite. I sat at the counter and was greeted immediately.
I had the Mexican omelette which came with hashbrowns and two pancakes--so much food. 
Everything was hot and delicious. My waiter was very friendly as well. 
I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"We went there this morning to celebrate Fathers Day.  Got there right before the restaurant filled up.  I got the Huntington omelette and my hubby had a standard breakfast of bacon and eggs, we both had pancakes and it all was devious!  Our server Janet was very attentive and our food arrived in a timely manner.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good breakfast menu. Love it here but there always is a wait of 20 minutes."}
{"text":"My mom and I had breakfast here recently.  It was a busy morning and we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  Not too bad for a busy morning and small place.  I had the PB and chocolate pancakes.  I will say they were tasty but the peanut butter flavor was not very strong.  They tasted more like regular buttermilk pancakes.  But I did enjoy them. 

My mom was hoping they would have waffles but settled on French toast instead.  She had the honey French toast.  She said it was pretty good and a big serving.  She also got a side of bacon which only had two pieces on it.  She would have liked 3 or 4 pieces which is what you usually get on a side order.

Overall this place was good.  Definitely a good pancake house if you are craving that."}
{"text":"I LOVE their lemon ricotta crepe like pancakes. OMG... I squeezed and mixed the lemon into the cream cheese syrup and poured it over the pancakes, which resulted in a party in my tummy. Wow! The taste was DIVINE! The pancakes were thin like a crepe and it was sufficient since I ordered that with the corned beef hash with rice and eggs. The corned beef was ok. 

The servers were very friendly, helpful, and quick.

When I return to Vegas, I'm definitely going back for the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and gave it a try. Our food was good. I had an omelet, which came with pancakes and hash browns. Larger portion size than necessary but I guess that's the American way. My friend had a sandwich and fries and he enjoyed that. Good pricing but there was a little of a wait when we got there. Service was good and food came out quickly. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"YUMMY! On our mission to try as many \"Yelp\" favorite restaurants we can, we of course had to stop by Babycakes Cafe. Babycakes had been blowing up on Yelp recently for their Red Velvet pancakes and Kahlua Pig Eggs Benedict. So, off we went...

At first site of the red velvet pancakes, my sweet bud sensors went off. ALARM- this may be way to sweet to eat! I was afraid, I was petrified. The beautiful red pancakes covered in chocolate pieces and whip cream with a side of cream cheese icing look....sweet. I WAS SURPRISED! The pancakes were not overly sweet at all. They were sooooo tasty. The cakes were rich tasting, almost like a cake. The icing was smooth and creamy and perfectly accented the cakes. YUM!

We also had the Kahlua pig benedict as well. It was pretty good too. I found the Kahlua pig to be a big to oniony but my boyfriend loved it .

Overall a great place to have breakfast / brunch. TIPS - we went on a Thursday and completely missed the over 1 hour wait on the weekends. This place is small and there is not a lot of seats so make sure to go early!

This Baby has her new favorite cakes - at Babycakes :)"}
{"text":"Sorry babystacks! I love you but I gotta give u 3 stars for now! We got there at 11 and told that there will be a 20 mins wait, but we got sat down 10 mins early.. Which is good. Then we started ordering at 11:10am and we got our food at 11:42.. Really 35 mins? and the funny thing is that the people got there 10 mins after us got their food out first. yup! but hey don't get me wrong i love the pancakes! best pancakes in vegas! ill never get tired of going to babystacks! ;) it just that it happened for the first time that i got disappointed with the service, and pls always check your customers needs!"}
{"text":"Good luck trying to get a table.  Showed up at this location and the wait was over an hour just to get a table,  drove to the second location and it was just as bad.  We ended up eating breakfast somewhere else.  I figured that if getting a table is that backed up, the kitchen probably is too.

Clearly, they need a bigger restaurant since we weren't the only ones leaving due to their lack of ability to accommodate weekend traffic."}
{"text":"Returned to Babystacks Cafe, and my family and I enjoyed these short stacks flavs - pumpkin, s'mores, blueberry & hazelnut, and hubby had Rick's adobo fried rice omelette."}
{"text":"This place has the best tasting pancakes I have ever had. You cant go wrong with their red velvet pancakes!"}
{"text":"I'm always psyched to find a new brunch place off the strip! My sister was visiting and she wanted to frequent her favorite restaurants in Vegas and Baby Stacks was one of them. We came in on Saturday for brunch and our party of four was seated in about 30 minutes. We each ordered some dishes and shared the sides: 

[1] Loco Moco - upgraded to garlic rice topped with a beef burger patty, two eggs over-easy and covered in gravy. I'm a big fan of loco moco and get it any time I can. The garlic rice was a nice upgrade and the dark gravy was delicious.

[2] Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - adobo fried rice wrapped omelet style and garnished with green onions. This was in a special golden box on the menu and I had my doubts, it was good but a little dry, and not amazing IMO.

[3] Banana Cream Pie Baby Stack - bananas and buttermilk pancakes topped with whipped cream, sliced bananas, and banana cream sauce. Definitely a banana cream overload, but not overly sweet. 

[4] Red Velvet Baby Stack - red velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and a side of cream cheese syrup - this is a stack for all those sweet tooths out there, it's very sweet and the cream cheese syrup just adds to the decadence. Great to share, but I don't think I can conquer a baby stack by myself. 

Overall we had a great experience, the service was excellent and the food was great. Kalua pork benedict... I'm coming back for you."}
{"text":"Big fan of their Loco Moco and Red Velvet pancakes. Even the standard pancakes are awesome! 

We don't mind the wait. You should be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Love the pancakes...I've bee trying some of the different breakfast items such as the Portuguese sausage and the spam and eggs scramble with steamed rice. It is ALL good. If you go on weekends, you are probably going to have to wait, but I have never waited longer than 20 minutes. The service is great also. This is certainly at the top of my favorite breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"We had out of town guests this weekend and decided to focus our meals on local establishments instead of chain restaurants. I'm certainly glad that we chose BabyStacks. We arrived about 10:50 on Sunday morning. It was a short 10 minute wait for a table. Two of us had the red velvet pancakes and our friend had banana pancakes (not banana cream). We all enjoyed our meals and had boxes to go. OMG! The red velvet pancakes were awesome. I didn't have the chocolate chips on top because that wasn't appealing to me. The service was good and fast. The restaurant is small. The only negative I have is that it is 12 miles from my house. Oh well...that won't stop me from returning."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. Have been coming here for years so it's about time that I've written this review. This location in particular is my favorite, they're always the busiest but we always get the best service here. I like this location because they're always consistent. No matter what I order or who I get as a server I always leave full & satisfied. Since me & my bf regularly come here we tend to order the same thing each time. I usually get the Portuguese Sausage with two eggs or loco moco with garlic rice with red velvet pancakes. Most recently we did try the Marble Crunch pancakes. Haven't really eaten much off of the breakfast menu but their Turkey Avocado BLT with their french fries well done is something that I've enjoyed as well. I definitely prefer breakfast here over Denny's or iHop where I feel their food is overpriced and never that good. They also play \"feel good\" music and as busy as they always are we NEVER feel like we overstay our welcome which allows us to dine comfortably."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good I come here honestly 2 times a week. I always get the same thing and each time I get the two egg breakfast I ask for my sunny side eggs to be cooked a little longer because it's kind of unappealing and disturbing when your egg can jiggle and I don't like my eggs like that yet they don't cook them longer :)) Whenever I come I PRAY I don't get this one lady and I always get her sadly. Her attitude is horrible she rolls her eyes the last time I was here I had to ask another server to go and get my waiter  because I was ready to order and she came out and once she saw me and my friend she rolled her eyes faked a smile and walked over to help us. Each time I come in I have to ask other people to help us because she doesn't check up on our table. I'm sitting her now and I had to ask someone else for the check and another worker had to ask if we wanted a re fill on drinks because they were empty and have been like that for a while because she doesn't check up on us. On the bright side Jordan is a very good worker and very helpful. I hope I don't get this lady the next time I come in she really deserves to be fired because it's honestly ridiculous how horrible her customer service is. Also as i'm sitting her someone else had to bring me my check. FOOD IS GREAT BUT THE LADY WITH THE FLOWER TATTOO ON HER CHEST NEEDS TO BE FIRED"}
{"text":"Love this place the food is absolutely delicious!! We waited about 30 minutes for a table but the food was absolutely wonderful the waiter was very friendly we had a large group of people and they served us in a timely manner great great great experience"}
{"text":"Great smiling servers with fast service. The food is great as well. I'll be back here the next time I am on this side of town. Maybe I'll even go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"+ The potatoes are good and not too seasoned. 
+ smores pancakes. Period. 
+ Kid friendly with plenty to choose from
+/- This is a pretty small place, but the again, the food is creative and very good. Get there early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish I lived in Las Vegas just so I could come here for breakfast regularly. Keep in mind this place is off strip so you need to drive, but the menu and prices are awesome! Also, be prepared for a wait and keep in mind it's easier to get a table for 2 than for a larger group.

My two favorite dishes are the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice. I've tried other pancakes here, but the red velvet are the best BY FAR. They even come with a side of cream cheese syrup. It's like having dessert for breakfast! The adobo fried rice comes wrapped in an omelet and is awesome!

I've also tried the spinach eggs benedict which is very tasty. It comes with a side of buttery hash browns. I will definitely be tryng the kalua pork benedict next time. The spam scramble sounded interesting, but was nothing special. The french toast is also not very good. Take my advice and try my two favorite dishes to make the trip worth it."}
{"text":"I come to BabyStacks Cafe every time I'm in Vegas. Usually I go to the original location but my girlfriends and I decided to try this one out since it's closer to the Strip. We arrived around 9am and were hoping there was no line (there's always one at the original location). We must have been lucky because we didn't wait at all for a table for 5 on a Saturday morning! 

Don't waste your time here. The only items worth ordering are the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice. That's it. Both dishes are amazing and you really can't get them anywhere else."}
{"text":"Every trip to Vegas includes a trip to Babystacks Cafe. I just can't get enough of their adobo fried rice and red velvet pancakes. I was hesitant to try this location because of the reviews but our group was forced to due to much longer waits at the other locations. I'll admit that the wait for a table was much shorter BUT the wait for our food was much longer than expected. I won't complain though because the food was just as good and worth every minute we waited. On this trip, our table decided on our usual dishes: adobo fried rice and red velvet pancakes. We also decided to try oreo cookie pancakes and a special loco moco dish of the day. Everything we ordered was a hit! You definitely can't go wrong by making a pit stop at Babystacks if you're ever in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service we received today! Along with 5 star worthy food. The Banana Cream Pie Pancakes were exquisite! Tasted like a pie on pancakes. So worth the stop since we were driving thru Vegas."}
{"text":"I got huevos rancheros no it says it comes with beans but look at the pick. Literally this i how the beans look when I got my plate and moved my tortilla. I had to order an extra side.  not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Randomly came across this place, after having seen and heard about it from friends, after our child's soccer class Sunday morning... we were informed of a roughly 20-30 minute wait, which was about what we expected for a Sunday at about noon. They actually sat us within 15 minutes, so I really have no complaints there. 

The service was good, attentive and responsive. Definitely busy, but again, expected for a Sunday afternoon.

Having no expectations for what they would have on their menu (other than pancakes), I was pleasantly surprised by their offerings. Essentially any kind of pancake and topping you wanted, crepe or French toast as well. We ended up getting lemon ricotta pancakes, hazelnut pancakes, and something on the other side of the menu that tugged at my little Filipina heart strings, Lolo's Adobo Fried Rice Omelete: chicken adobo, fried rice, all inside an omelete. 

The Lemon Ricotta was soft and subtle - the lemon flavor rather eases its way in like an aftertaste, but was not as robust as I would have expected. The Hazelnut was what my Nutella-loving heart was after: Nutella, whipped cream, and crushed hazelnuts, which added a terrific crunchy texture to the mix. I additionally added bananas, which I highly recommend for a balanced sweetness. 

The Adobo Rice Omelet: it brought me home. It felt like a home-cooled meal that my mom would have made me, and I was so glad to have stumbled across it. I honestly didn't need the potatoes that came on the side. 

Overall, portion sizes were huge, decent service, good prices, good and varied selection sure to make each member of your party happy."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice brunch here the last time we were in town. Located in a busy shopping plaza, Babystacks is good for breakfast and lunch options. I came here mainly at the suggestion of fluffy pancakes by friends who frequent it. I like that they have Hawaiian & traditional American breakfast items.

I went with the spam scramble and a babystack of chocolate chip pancakes. The spam scramble was ok. It came with a scoop of furikake rice and a decent amount of cubed spam and scrambled eggs. I prefer my spam a little more toasty but other than that, this dish is not bad. 

The pancakes... Oh so good. Im glad I picked the chocolate chip. It was a great topping along with the whipped cream & powdered sugar. The pancakes were soft and fluffy. I really enjoyed them. It came with a chocolate sauce but I didnt even use it. The pancakes didnt need them. They were tasty as is. The portion was also just right. 

Service was good. We had 3 different people asking us for our drink orders after someone already took it. Ha!.. Babystacks is busy. Pay up at the register when you get your bill. They close by mid-afternoon. FYI."}
{"text":"Aammazing! Absolutely love the food here. I always get the red velvet pancakes with bacon and potatoes on the side. The pancakes were super light and fluffy, I would take a whole stack home if it held up okay. :) the Hawaiian food is also delicious, it definitely satisfies my craving for kula pork. 

Service is always good. They're very friendly and attentive which makes for a great experience here. I highly recommend this place, just try and come a little early on in the morning. :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice, my wife absolutely loves the Loco moco. This time my wife got there a couple minutes before I did. The hostest Blanca greeted her. When she asked for a table for 2, she was met with the rude response \"I'll sit you this time, but next time your whole party has to be present\" seriously??  I said TWO, not 12. Not cool. Our server was very nice, but she peed on todays experience for sure."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - went here based off of the reviews it had during our trip to Vegas. However, it was very mediocre and I found myself saying what they could have done to everything to make it just a bit better. One star for using real blueberries in their pancakes, and one star for the service. Our waitress was so nice with us even when they lost our order, it didn't even seem like a big deal to us when she told us because she was so apologetic. The only good thing I did eat was the pumpkin pancakes. The whipped cream on top was actually one of the best things I ate here. 

Their \"cream cheese\" syrup was meh. They should use more cream cheese in that syrup to keep the tang of the cheese. One fork dip for the testing and that was all I needed. They should also think about using real maple syrup...... Just sayin'. The hashbrowns were so generously pulled out of the freezer, browned a bit on each side with some thick grease, and put on a plate. Real tasty and this is me being real sarcastic. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate breakfast there on Saturday.  My pancakes were good, but my wife was disappointed in here crepes.  The AC was down and it was getting warm, and the soda machine was now working.  We most likely will eat there again, that might have something  to do with how close it is to our house."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good breakfast joint that caters to carnivores and sweet toothed mammals alike...look no further than Baby Stacks.  I believe the original location is on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Although, the location that I frequent is the expansion branch on Buffalo and just south of Flaming-O.

Baby Stacks, to me, falls into that Island-Style breakfast category that you can find at Cinnamon's and Boots & Kimo's on the Windward side of Oahu, nestled in beautiful Kailua.  This style consists of the normal comfort breakfasts including spam or pocho sausages with rice and eggs your way in addition to loco mocos, an island favorite.  But specialty benedicts and an elaborate pancake menu is now a common theme in island breakfasts.

I usually get the kalua pork eggs benedict but opted for the grilled cheese kalua pork sandwich on special.  The sandwich was good, but more appealing to the eyeballs than the taste buds.  Also, I have this unquenchable appetite for Tabasco, sue me, and tend to douse my kalua pork and manapuas in it, I'm talking drowning...lol.  If it weren't for my spicy little friend, the meal could have been much worse.  A banana cream pie stack was added and by far my favorite aside from carrot cake pancakes so far.  The white chocolate mac nut is again more name than anything.  My lady went with the zesty chicken omelet and like most onomatopoeia, was exactly that...zesty.

The place is a hit, both locations, so be prepared to wait if you aren't there before the rush.  The place reminds me of home with smiles from local islanders, but, I know for a fact that a lot of mainlanders aren't big on it and the culture, so beware.  

Otherwise, decor and ambiance is good and staff is friendly and attentive.  The check out dude has a Filipino accent and a little rough around the edges, so bare with him.  Parking is plentiful and although, not quite on the level of Cinnamon's, the place is definitely worth a look.

The sad thing is that there is no seafood related items on the menu, such as lox and the the like.  I know breakfast is not synonymous with fish, but I came here on a Friday during lent, and my selections were limited.  I had to settle for a spinach omelet and a short stack, but it didn't quell the monsters in my tummy.

So if you want some island style mornings grinds, craving for traditional breakfasts, or just looking for some sweets, this isn't a bad stop."}
{"text":"Well I tried to explain to my 11 year old daughter that there was a wait here because it was good.  People wait 30 minutes for good food.  She said, can't we just go to IHOP - there is no waiting there... I am trying to instill the value of trying new things.

So we waited about 30 minutes and ordered.  My daughter ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes (RVP).  She later declared that yes - this place is worth the wait!

I had portugese sausage and eggs.  It has good.  Eggs basted perfetly.  Sausage was good.  Portion size and price were fair.  Service was excellent.  They have Hawaiian selections here.  

This is a stand out breakfast place.  Not quite five stars - they are just doing breakfast here... but they do it well!  The RVP almost make this 5 stars - 4.5 stars fo sho!"}
{"text":"Vegas is quickly becoming my home away from home.  The mister and I want to continue with our off the beaten path Vegas experience.  I've been wanting to try BabyStacks ever since I discovered that they serve Adobo Fried Rice omelette. 

We headed over to BabyStacks as soon as we arrived from our long journey from LA.  The place a bit small and there was already a wait at 8:30AM on a Saturday morning.   The 10 minute wait wasn't too bad considering some of the lengthy waiting I've had done in the past.  

While I waited, I noticed the sign with the pancake specials: Almond Joy pancakes or Butterfinger pancakes.  Ooh!  That sounded yummy.  I also noticed that a lot of the people were ordering Red Velvet pancakes.  It was going to be hard for me to decide what to order.  

When we got to our table, I quickly scanned the menu for the Adobo Fried Rice omelet and I got nervous when I couldn't find it under omelettes.  Then, low and behold, I saw Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. The description said it was chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg.  Bingo!  That was it.  I ordered that as well as the Almond Joy pancakes.  

I got my pancakes and was pleasantly surprised at what I saw.  I thought it was going to be a regular pancake with bits of Almond Joy candy pieces scattered though the batter.  Instead, it was a chocolate pancake with coconut flakes and sliced almonds sprinkled on top of the whipped cream with chocolate drizzle.  It tasted like a friggin cupcake, it was sooo good.  

The Adobo Fried Rice was also spectacular.  It was such a clever idea.  Why didn't I think of making that?  I made a mental note to try making my own version one of these days.  The only thing that fell flat was the macaroni salad that was served with it, it was very bland.  I doused it with Sriracha sauce, which helped.  

This is an awesome breakfast spot. Prices are very reasonable and it is great for families. I wished they had a location back in LA.  At least it will be one of my breakfast spots whenever I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"My first time here-- great!! I had their Portuguese sausage with a side of two red velvet pancakes. Both were so good and what the restaurant is known for! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Actual rating was a 4.5. I seriously wished there were half-star ratings, as this place deserved more than just 4 stars.

Dad: Go find where the latest I-HOP or Dennys is that isn't on the Strip for breakfast. Don't want to walk that far.
Whenever a suggestion of either occurs and I'd rather not go to chains , I use Yelp to find where I could find a gem.
Me: (looks at the review page for this restaurant) How about this place? I'm already sold on red velvet pancakes.
Dad: Sure.

So after about ~20 minutes of driving, we come across what appears to be the REAL Las Vegas, even down to the \"Lugaw\" sign. We kinda got lost, but quickly found our way back after realizing that their restaurant was across the street and had changed their name.

We came in at just the right time, we were able to find seats yet the restaurant was starting to fill up. I observe the \"People Love Us on Yelp\" and \"Best of Las Vegas 2011\" stickers near the front door. 

As I looked at the menu I see a couple of things that struck a chord. \"$1 extra for garlic fried rice\". \"Corned beef hash and eggs\". \"Rick's ADOBO fried rice\". This wasn't going to be a typical breakfast place. What sealed the deal was the \"extra charge to replace buttermilk pancakes with your favorite pancakes.\" SOLD. (If it wasn't already obvious, I'm a Filipino-American with a slight obsession for red velvet). It also helps that all the waitstaff looked Filipino.

My mom built her own omelet, dad ordered the adobo fried rice and I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs with garlic fried rice and red velvet pancakes.

I was quite pleasantly surprised that our breakfast came out pretty quickly. I wolfed my dish down in probably the same amount of time it took to cook it while maintaining a sense of decency. The dish was everything I expected from a Filipino family if they were going to cook the same dish using American corned beef. The onion in the garlic fried rice was a nice touch and I'll consider modifying my garlic fried rice recipe to include onion.

The red velvet pancakes were quite delicious, it tasted like red velvet, but more savory than say a red velvet cupcake. Went well with the melted cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips.

One of these days I'll have to try the adobo fried rice. I wasn't able to have some because I didn't want to infect my dad with a cold, and though it was one of my choices as to what to order, I didn't order it because the dish didn't come with pancakes. Maybe next time.

From this experience I learned a lesson: A lot of the more casual dining gems in Vegas are found off-strip and I look forward to finding more of them. I WILL come back here someday just to round off my review and (hopefully!) upgrade to a 5."}
{"text":"Actual rating 3.5.

The best advice to Vegas on a budget is to eat off-Strip if you can. Not only does eating out become much more reasonable, you would be surprised of the variety of options. Considering that most locals avoid the Strip if at all possible, some of the real hidden gems can be found.

To a lot of locals, this restaurant is one of those gems. Most plates are less than $10/order, which is unheard of on the Strip. Not only that by eating here the plates can feed you for at least half the day. While there are no reservations and everyone in your party must be present, if you can wait 30 minutes to an hour, the meal would be worth it.

The menu features quite a bit of Hawaiian and Filipino plates, so when eating here try one of the plates and upgrade to a short stack of pancakes if you can. My order consisted of the homemade corned beef hash and eggs over medium ($10.95) with an upgrade to garlic fried rice ($1.00) and red velvet pancakes. 
- The corned beef is similar in texture to the corned beef found in the square American cans which are commonly given as gifts when people visit the Philippines on vacation. Personally I like the Australian corned beef found in the bigger round cans, but this is hard to come by and only one restaurant I know served it like that. Still delicious.
- Garlic fried rice has an interesting note - \"contains onions\". I can taste more onion powder than I can the garlic. Also still good.

Pancakes are good, but I was more impressed by sight than taste. The pancakes look quite fluffy and I like the toppings, but the pancakes just by themselves are plain with a slightly bitter aftertaste due to having too much baking powder. The toppings really do make the pancake taste a lot better, which was the case with the red velvet (cream cheese) and the hazelnut (Nutella).

My family likes to go here for breakfast because you can get full here for the same price as eating out at IHOP or a little more than Denny's. Despite some of my minor issues I would still recommend eating here as you get good value for your money."}
{"text":"Pretty good sit down hawaiian food breakfast cafe. I liked the omelette that I got, but since i was trying to watching my diet I really limited myself.

My firend who I ate with ate some pretty good dishes though. I liked their adobo fried rice with egg. Soooo good! Had it with a bit of sriracha and it was bomb!

i would come back again."}
{"text":"Always packed no matter what time you go. But the food is worth it. Comes pretty close to Hawaiian/Filipino style food but it's the banana foster pancakes which makes up for everything!"}
{"text":"The sitting situation in this place is ridiculous. If u are a two top u get to wait for 40 min and if a four top opens they give it to somebody that just arrived. This needs to change."}
{"text":"The adobo was over rated; a lot of rice but skimpy on the chicken, the flavor was good though. If I had to choose again, I'd choose differently. The red velvet pancakes were on point!!! I would definitely recommend that."}
{"text":"So I finally tried this place out!  It has been on my list forever and finally woke up early and drove over.  Reading reviews I know the place is small and gets busy so I got there right at 7am on a Saturday.  I was the second group to be seated.  Within 30 minutes the whole place was filled up and a line was forming.  I was shocked on how fast that happened.  

Since I really came for the red velvet pancakes, that's what I ordered, short stack and a side of sausage patties.  The RV pancakes were delicious and so filling!!!  I wasn't to fond of syrup stuff they give, its just to sweet for me.  I mean the whole platter is a sugar high but I just couldn't do the syrup.  I would rather have regular syrup, next time.  The pancakes were good enough that really the syrup wasn't needed.  I only hate half the pancakes and took the rest home.  Seriously the short stack was just to much, haha.  The sausage patties were really good and I enjoyed them.  

The service was great and they were on top of checking up on me, filling my water, etc...  I definitely want to come back again and try some of the other stuff on the menu.  I do know though, its a place to get to first thing because I am hungry when I wake up and get grumpy without food, haha."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite breakfast place to eat. If you want pancacks then you need to check this place out. They have a few locations, but I prefer the one on buffalo and flamingos. Never had a problem with customer service they have a bery friendly staff."}
{"text":"In town for the MDW and of course had to make a stop here for brunch.  This location is so convenient since I have family that live near this restaurant.  

We always order our favorites which are the banana fosters (short stack) pancakes and the adobo fried rice that comes with red velvet pancakes that comes with it. My husband and I always leave satisfied and of course stuffed! After eating at this place, our next meal will be dinner. 

Unfortunately, they don't take reservations and it's a first come first serve basis and your entire party must be present in order to be seated.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly and make sure that you get refills on your drinks. 

If you haven't been here, I HIGHLY recommend that you go.  They have other locations. It's better than any breakfast/brunch meal that you'll ever get at the strip."}
{"text":"Love coming here when we are visiting Las Vegas. A favorite of mine is the adobo fried rice and of course red velvet pancakes! It is a must to come and eat here. There is nothing on the strip that compares to this place.  They do not take reservations, and your party must be all present, otherwise, they cannot seat you.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite place to go for breakfast! From the varieties of pancakes to skillets and omelets, I can never just order one meal! Leftovers and take homes are mandatory when visiting here! The servers are always nice, helpful, and attentive.. The food always comes quickly after ordering and the price is definitely worth the food! 30$ plus tip for 2 for a Sunday breakfast with leftovers.."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Hazelnut pancakes with Nutella drizzle was a nice way to start my day."}
{"text":"Only thing I don't like is the wait, but you can get around that by ordering to go.  Outside the different kinds of pancake options, the rest of the food is just ok. The pancakes are the real winner here. Amazing combinations! I love the Banana's Foster personally, and the carrot cake. Great place to take out of town guest to give them something different."}
{"text":"I remember when there was only one Babystacks Cafe, the original location near me at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Back when it opened in 2011, there were long waits on the weekends for the renowned red velvet pancakes that were served up.  People came from near and far to eat there and I became a regular customer, too.  Since then, Babystacks has opened up other locations and Henderson finally got its own in the summer of 2014.  

I've been to this location a few times now and I really can't see the difference in taste or service; that's a good thing.  I have friends who live in Henderson who never went to Babystacks because it was just too far from them.  When I get together with those Henderson pals, we at least have the option to come here for some of our favorites that Babystacks is known for, including:  the red velvet pancakes as well as the Cinnabun (my favorite); Rick's Adobo Fried Rice; Portuguese Sausage and Eggs; Loco Moco.  There is still a wait on the weekends in the mornings, so be prepared; you may get hangry in the process."}
{"text":"Wowee!  I finally got to eat here after hearing all about the red velvet pancakes.  I waited until a day that I had a good, long workout in before venturing over and imbibing what I assumed would be massive amounts of carbs.  Today was that day:  I ran 10 long miles (triathlon training) beforehand and then met a friend at 8:30am for the sugar-fest.  There was a short wait for our table since this is a cozy, little joint, but we were seated in 5 minutes instead of the 15 that was initially mentioned.  Service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  Afraid that the red velvet pancakes would be just too sweet for a whole breakfast, I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and hash browns with the pancakes on the side.  Yes, this girl can eat!  The nice surprise is that the pancakes were not as sweet as expected.  Yes, they come topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips, but the cream cheese syrup is on the side and one can control how much sweetness with that stuff.  I LOVED them!  My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were also delish.  I want to go back tomorrow and try some of the other tempting items on the menu--it may be a blessing or a curse that Babycakes is right down the street from my house!"}
{"text":"As a diehard BabyStacks fan, I got myself over to the new location this morning with my partner in crime, taking advantage of the Yelp deal being offered.  The second cafe is bigger than the first and there was no wait, but I'm sure that won't last long once word gets out that the new joint has arrived.  I'm happy to report that we received the same great customer service and the same delicious food.  My regular order of Cinnabun pancakes, scrambled eggs, and hash browns arrived at our table in no time at all.  Bob Marley was blasting as I savored each delicious bite--what more can a Yelping gal like me ask for except...more?  Keep it up, BabyStacks crew and mahalo!"}
{"text":"My family and I love babystacks. Reasonable prices for great food. They have really good omelets and local moco.  The red velvet pancakes are also delicious."}
{"text":"I like to go in here because we don't need to wait long to be seated, they make a great French toast. Love it. I also like the Nutella crepes. Absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. Beats the chain places for sure. At times there can be quite a bit of a wait and they don't accept reservations. So on a Sunday morning you can expect up to a 45 minute wait to get seated. The food is usually very good and tasty and the service swift."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The service is good as well. They don't have waffles here, though. Just to let you know 'cause we solely came here for waffles. *sad face* my boyfriend really enjoyed it here 'cause I guess the owners here are from Hawaii, so they had Like corned beef hash, and like, Portuguese sausages and adobo fried rice and what not. 
I didn't try the pancakes there other than the butter milk babycakes that came with my plate, and I wish they had given me more syrup! But other than that, it was good. 
I would come here again for a breakfast/brunch date."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat in Vegas!  I go to Vegas several times a year and make it a point to stop here every time.  Its about 10 minutes from the strip and usually a line out the door, but worth the wait.  Stop by early and you won't have a wait, but who wakes up early in Vegas.  Try any of their pancakes or their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came across this place from my friend that introduce me here. I been going to this place since high school. I always get their Adobo Fried rice which is about $10+ and it comes with some short stack pancakes. You can never beat that price with this place. I'm all set with breakfast when I go over here and start my day. They do close early around 3pm and they do get really busy. So get here around like noon-ish?"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I got the opportunity to try the food here but nope didn't get the chance and that's thanks to the customer service here. Here's the story:

Today at 10:20am I called to place an order for pick up. I was told: ok hang on a second and I'll be right with you. After hanging on for 7 minutes (still not getting my order taken), I was hung up on. Guess this business does not want my money and thanks to this experience they'll NEVER get it. Oh and I'll post a screenshot of me being on hold with the time stamp a reference to how long I was on hold."}
{"text":"Banana foster pancakes are the best I've ever had. The Portuguese sausage and eggs was good too."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, haven't tried their lunch yet but the omelettes and skillets are really good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A smallish sort of place that serves up great food.  I ordered a stack of Red Velvet pancakes and they were terrific.  Be prepared to wait though.  We went on a weekday and there was a line of people outside.  I can only imagine the weekends!"}
{"text":"I have traveled the world, and I have been to some great breakfast joints but, Babystacks hands down has the best pancakes I have ever had.

This is my second time at Babystacks in Henderson (near Sunset Station Casino) and I can't say enough about this place. If you are looking for an outside of the box breakfast joint, Babystacks is the place to go. 

This weekend we stopped in and after much deliberation, I ordered the Cookies n' Cream pancakes off of their limited edition menu. It was one of those dining choices that left you thinking... this is going to be really good or this is going to be really bad. 

Well ladies and gentlemen, when these pancakes arrived my taste-buds were doing the happy dance. I knew as soon as I saw them that I would be eating every last bite. 

My half stack order of Cookies n' Cream Pancakes came with three (3) large chocolate pancakes with pieces of oreo cookies mashed up inside. I'm really not sure how they did it but the oreo pieces inside were still crunchy. Drizzled on top was vanilla cream icing and topped with homemade whipped cream (as if it couldn't get any better). And instead of topping this creation off with a cherry, they sprinkled pieces of crushed up oreo on top. 

One may think the pancakes are super sweet. Surprisingly it is not overwhelmingly sweet. The chocolate pancakes must be made with a unsweetened coco, allowing you to fully enjoy the sweet icing they place on top.

It was a again, a major score at Babystacks. Next go around I will be trying out their red velvet pancakes.

If you're a local or in town visiting, you must find one of their three locations and get in to try this place. You won't be let down, I promise!"}
{"text":"I guess I just don't get it. Was looking for a place to have breakfast. Nothing special. Nothing over the top. Just plain breakfast. This was not the place. This is over the top eating. All these fu fu foods. Chocolate chip pancakes, red velvet, lots of fluff.
I ordered a simple senior breakfast. Brought me a short stack of pancakes with 1 pat of butter. What the heck??? The pancakes were nothing special. 
These people are looking for the 20-30 something crowd with kids and an open wallet.
Won't be back. By the looks of the line out the door, they won't miss me."}
{"text":"I love Babystacks! I have never been so impressed by a breakfast cafe. The red velvet pancakes come with a cream cheese syrup that is DELICIOUS, and the biscuits and gravy are the best I've had in town. They have a large selection of breakfast foods, including smores pancakes (yum!) and a make-your-own-omelette option, as well as a small lunch menu. Prices are very reasonable (never paid more than $25-30 for two people) and definitely worth the quality of the food. They have some policies you might want to be aware of if going with a group... they don't split checks and all members of a party must be present to be seated. On weekdays, I've never experienced a wait longer than 5 minutes. I have yet to attend on a weekend, though."}
{"text":"The atmosphere could be a little better. It feels a little cramped with cheap furnishings. The food, however, mostly makes up for it. There are many items to choose from. The plain pancakes didn't impress me a whole lot (tasted like box mixed) but everything else was tasty and perfectly cooked. The flavored pancakes are great."}
{"text":"Wow what a place. Came here on a recommendation and damn is it good.

First off, the menu is pretty big and pretty awesome. It's got a unique / filipino flair to it with their Portuguese sausage, adobo omelette thing (side note: it's not really an omelette). They had a special Kalua Pork Sliders or something like that when I was there.

Nearly everything comes with pancakes and they have a ton of different kinds from S'mores to Rocky Road to Banana Cream Pie to Red Velvet, etc. The list goes on, but your stomach will not. It's only $1.50 to upgrade your regular pancake order to one of their fancier ones...and I'd recommend that if I were you.

I got the Mexican omelette ($9.25), which was awesome. It comes with 4 eggs in the omelette. It also has the option of either seasoned potatoes or hash browns...I opted for the hash browns on a spur of the moment decision, but I think I'd go for the seasoned potatoes next time. They're not huge pieces of dry potatoes, but really crispy, smaller pieces that make them perfect. I made that mistake, but you live and you learn. My friend got toast with her omelette...not sure if it was a side of toast or somehow it came with her meal, but when they give you toast, they don't mess around...she had 6 1/2 bread slices (so 3 whole slices for those not good at math). And they're huge pieces

Anyways, it's about 5 miles off the strip, but definitely worth the drive for something a little more local and delicious and different."}
{"text":"WOW! 
By far the best pancakes at a restaurant I have ever had. The carrot cake is one of my favorites. The lemon ricotta more crepe like then pancake but don't let that sway you from trying them, they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I was happy to get off the strip for breakfast. The Husband and I were very excited to try this place given their good reviews and their amazing sounding menu. When we arrived, it was pretty empty, but I guess that's expected on a Monday and only a couple days before Christmas. We were seated and I must have spent 30 minutes trying to make up my mind on what to get...it was a pretty big decision after all. Finally, I decided to get what the Husband called 'the coward's breakfast' (since I just avoided making a decision by getting one of everything) which consisted of 2 eggs, rice with garlic/onion stuffs, and 2 hazelnut pancakes (I couldn't make up my mind....I call it the Most Winning Breakfast...but that's me!). He got the orange creamsicle pancakes. The pancakes were tiny, but filling. Mine had got od flavor, but were served kind of cold. The rice was not as delicious as I thought...it was garlicky, but didn't have any flavor beyond that. The eggs were cooked well. The husband liked his pancakes, but I didn't care for them. The service was attentive. Overall, it was fine, but definitely not deserving of the raves I had heard....just another breakfast place IMO."}
{"text":"There are two locations in Las Vegas. The physical space is limited, so it may be best to order to-go.
They have the best pancakes in the city with an incredible amount of variety; their red velvet pancakes are their specialty. That's all I wanted to share, but Yelp is making me type more so I'm going to finish this review with a series of button mashing.
Dhudduhdddujjfswwxcbjjyref. Fuujbdssujcxssshiofrdcbjjbfxddtujkcfdd. Diiifsvnkuyddccnnj."}
{"text":"Love EVERYTHING about baby stacks, they are awesome!!! Great service & food! Must visit anytime in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The garlic fried rice is soak in grease. No seasoning. And service is so bad. She didn't even check on us for refills and I have to grab another waitress for a service. Everything Is greasy. I will never recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite breakfast place. One bite of those Red Velvet Pancakes and you're addicted lol.
Anytime my husband asks me where I want to go for breakfast, the answer is always Babystacks. Always lok"}
{"text":"Arrived in Vegas about 9am and this was the first place we ate.  I, too, saw great reviews from Yelp and no doubt the food and service was just amazing.  The adobo fried rice was my favorite along with the Nutella crepes and banana foster pancakes!  It was so good we came back again for breakfast as we returned home to California!  Wishing they would bring it to Cali!  I would definitely recommend this awesome place."}
{"text":"EHHH, I have definitely had better. 

Before we left Nevada, we wanted to grab some American breakfast. My friend lives in Henderson so we decided to give this place a try 608 reviews, 4 stars, whoa. We came there around 12 PM and did not get seated until 1 PM for a part of 4 even though we were told the wait time was only 30 minutes. We noticed there were outside seating and asked if it was quicker to sit outside, the hostess stated yes but that was false. I find the way they seat their guests is extremely flawed which is why the wait is so long. Instead of sliding two tables together to make a table of 4, they would go through the list and seat those whose party is only 2. So they decided to sit all the smaller parties first after pushing a bunch of tables together before seating us. In the end, they sat us at a table that were pushed together. If you were going to do that then why did we wait for over 30 minutes to get seated AFTER you had already sat everyone else who came AFTER us? Makes no sense. 

We sat down and the waiter took a bit of time to get to us. We ordered the Banana Cream Pie, Hawaiian Macadamia nut pancakes, Lola Cora's corned beef hash and eggs , loco moco, and their signature adobo fried rice, hash browns, and potatoes. I was told by our waiter that everyone seem to prefer the Lola Cora's corned beef hash and eggs but I didn't see the hype. The corned beef was not well seasoned and tasted very bland. I ordered it with garlic rice and the rice came out soggy and bland as well. I felt the need to drench it in soy sauce or add my own pepper and salt seasoning or ANYTHING because it was so bland. It came with a baby stack of original pancakes which was good. Their signature adobo fried rice was wrapped in an omelets and it came with the options of country potatoes or hash browns. The hash brown was delicious! It was crunchy and fried to perfection. The adobo fried rice itself was okay. There wasn't much texture to it. The banana cream pie was super buttery and sweet. The Hawaiian pancakes were a 3/5 since I have had better. I wish they had added bananas because it would have definitely complete the dish. The loco moco was a huge disappointment. The sausages were a little hard and as previously mentioned, the garlic rice was super soggy. The gravy sauce that came with it was good however I wish all the other components on the plate was equally as tasty. 

Overall, I don't see the hype. Customer service were nice however the wait made it not worth it. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"They can't manage their wait times.  They said there was no wait and we couldn't put our name in over the phone.  By the time we got there, fifteen minutes later, the was an half hour wait.  They shut have been able to predict that."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and they do not disappoint. We ordered the adobo fried rice with red velvet pancakes and the kalbi with eggs!! It was awesome. Very tasty and the servings are okay.  If you're ever in the Vegas area give them a try. I will definitely be back here again soon!!"}
{"text":"If Yelp had half stars, this review would be 3.5 stars not 3. We came in on Sunday morning & waited for about 20 minutes for a table for 2. Our overall experience was good and our server was nice & checked up on us with good timing. 

The reasoning for my 3.5 stars is -1 star for the Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.. it wasn't very good and was more like 2 (not so crispy) chicken strips smothered in buffalo sauce & thrown on the bun.. and the lettuce they used was all chopped up so everything was falling out. The sandwich was just a let down and it basically ruined my whole meal because I was getting so frustrated with it. 

BUT. We also ordered Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, which was amazing!! And we upgraded the side to the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut Pancakes, which was also good! 

-0.5 star for someone who forgot our extra plates. Why ask us if we need anything else if you don't plan on coming back? I won't point out who, but prior to coming in I've read a couple of bad reviews directed toward this person already. 

All in all, I would've gave the 5 stars if it wasn't for these issues.."}
{"text":"I always get the loco moco and red velvet pancakes! It's a great breakfast place to go to"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times already, but I keep forgetting to review it. This review is based on my experience today only.

Service: This place is always busy, so it took them about no more than ten minutes to get us seated. I'm not complaining because there are other days where the wait is an hour (sometimes, more). Anyway, the servers here are always very nice and prompt. Ours was definitely perfect to us today; she was wonderful! They check on you often, and they don't take forever just to serve you or bring you your drinks/food. A+ for their service, seriously. I've never been disappointed.

Food: They have a lot of Hawaiian-Filipino-American fused food items on their menu, so I love that this place is very original for that. I ordered 3 spam and eggs over easy with garlic fried rice & hash browns on the side. I also upgraded my pancake. They're known for their delicious red velvet pancakes with whipped cream and cocoa powder sprinkled on top with cream cheese syrup (yum yum), so of course I upgraded to that. (Almost) Everything came out delicious and hot! However, I wasn't the biggest fan of their garlic fried rice. The rice was really oily and the garlic tasted burnt... I don't like wasting food that I paid for, so I ate it anyway. But I have learned my lesson. Other than the rice, the rest of my food was delicious!

Overall experience: I really do enjoy this place. It's one of my favorite places to go eat at. It's affordable, inexpensive, and delicious. Service is great. The food is delicious. But never again with the garlic fried rice."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to dine here. When we first pulled up, their was a 20 minute wait for a table. This cafe is not super small but not large either. Thankfully, we found a couple of seats at the counter and bypassed the wait. When a place is a crowded as this place was, you know it must be good.

A lot of choices for breakfast from the very basic to some standard Hawaiian staples. Their specialty being pancakes and there are so many to choose from. You have to keep coming back to taste all the flavors. I think I counted 21 different kinds of pancakes! WOW!

We ended up ordering the sausage and egg breakfast which came with yummy potatoes and a baby stack of buttermilk pancakes. This was a lot of food and I honestly could not not finish although I did try hard. Food was very good and the pancakes were definitely the highlight. Super light, not doughy, fluffy and with the hot syrup on top they just melted in your mouth. 

I will definitely return here or another location. They were really busy but the servers still were nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Been to a few different Babystacks around town. The one closest to me is less than a mile down the road from where I live, off Buffalo and Flamingo. There are a couple other good places to check out in this little strip mall area including 'Komex' and 'Off The Hook'.

Service and food are consistent between here and the two other locations I have been in. It is a Filipino-Hawaiian influenced cafe. I noticed the big set of wooden knife, spoon, and fork hanging on the wall (a favorite wall hanging in many Filipino homes). 

My favorite is Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice platter. I usually add one of their signature pancakes (usually the red velvet pancakes). I have sat at their dining bar when I am alone as well as at a table with family/friends. Staff is always friendly and efficient. Food comes out in a timely manner. Wait time can vary depending on time of day. We have waited as long as 20 minutes. (Please note, when you reserve a table, your entire party must be present in order to be seated).

The place is usually busy no matter which location I have gone to but wait times have been tolerable or move quickly. All in all, a great place to have breakfast/brunch whether ny yourself or with friends/family."}
{"text":"The line was long but as expected due to their high rating.  Place is good and the red velvet pancake was good.  Their chicken fried stake was thick and juicy."}
{"text":"This is where pancakes go to die :) This is pancake heaven! Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Flavorful. Sweet. Perfect texture. They're huge. You will split this meal. Or you should. Sausage was fantastic. Omelettes were great. Food was reasonably priced. Only issue is the wait to get in. You could wind up waiting for 45 minutes to get in some days. Decor is nothing to look at, but you're not here for the decor anyway. 

Go to Babystacks. Try the carrot cake pancakes or the snickers pancakes. Prepare to gain weight."}
{"text":"We went at around 9am on a Wednesday and there was no wait. (Place did get much busier when we left the place) Ordered the mocha chip and strawberry shortstack. Strawberry shortstack was just a shortstack with strawberries and whipped cream. Plain and expected but it was still delicious. (But you can kinda get something like this somewhere else) Mocha chip pancakes felt like it was a bit too much for me. Just really sweet and really heavy. Didnt like it. But I wanted to give 4 star rating because of their friendly service. My coffee was always filled by our observant server. Thanks. Overall, decent food and great service. If i'm nearby, i might come again."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved the atmosphere, the Hawaiian music in the background and also their food! When I came here I ordered the adobo fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. 

The red velvet pancakes melts in your mouth and the amount of sweetness is perfect. 

I'm from out of town, so the next time I visit Las Vegas, I'll be sure to come here again!"}
{"text":"Cool spot to try when you're in Vegas. This place is known for its red velvet pancakes. I'm not too much into eating sweets or pancakes for that matter, but I can tell you this, this place was good and so were their red velvet pancakes. Also got to try their rocky road pancake and i'll tell you, it was better than the red velvet pancakes that's for sure. I think it was just better to me because it's just my kinda taste, I prefer chocolate over red velvet any day, but I highly suggest getting the red velvet pancakes anyways, because every here seems to like it. Overall having breakfast here was good, they have different stuff to choose from other than pancakes such as bacon and eggs and stuff. If you decide to come here, do be prepared though to wait awhile, this place seems to always be packed."}
{"text":"What is the big deal about this place?  The food is unremarkable.  Frozen potatoes and pancakes from a mix.  Their \"banana pancakes\" were just a couple of tough, dry pancakes with a few slices of banana on top. 

Nothing tasted like it was made from scratch.  The chicken fried steak was definitely a pre-breaded, frozen piece of crap.  The gravy on top also tasted canned.  I'm sure it was.

Their signature Red Velvet Pancakes were alright but certainly no big deal.  Way too sweet for my taste.  I don't want dessert for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Red Velvet but I gotta say the Red Velvet Pancake a must try I enjoyed them and would order them again. Also had the Rick's adobo fried rice omelette it was okay and Breakfast Burrito was a alright. But the Red Velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup whip cream & shaved chocolate makes it all good."}
{"text":"Babystacks is home to what seems to be Vegas' holy grail of all pancakes - red velvet. Now this is the only place I've actually seen with red velvet pancakes so props for being unique. 

I was prepared to have my mind blown, ready to have a foodgasm from the supposedly amazing pancakes. 

Is it in yet? Unfortunately, if I have to even ask then we have a problem. It's not like there was anything wrong. It was actually pretty good (albeit a bit too sweet and heavy) but the price is what made it just ok. The prices for the menu in general are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast places. However, the short stack is perfectly filling for me.

Service is decent and decor is bland and could use an update, especially when compared to the northside location."}
{"text":"Went here on 12/14/14 for breakfast about 15 minutes after they opened with Brian P. We had our pick of the place but once our food arrived, most of the restaurant was filled. Come early!

I wasn't starving so we decided to split the Huntington omelette and upgrade to the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes. 

While the pancakes were good, there was something about the omelet that I didn't like. Either the eggs were overcooked or it was dry. Also, the omelet just wasn't well seasoned. I remember nothing about the home fries, other than we received a large portion of them.

This one meal came out to more than $14 - which I believe is a bit much for breakfast food.

Although the pancakes were good and the service was friendly, there's nothing that makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"Hawaii in Las Vegas?! I was Airbnb-ing nearby, and before heading out to Red Rock, it was only smart to fill up my belly first. Found this place on Yelp, apparently known for its pancakes. Not that I'm a huge pancake person, but I was with someone who is picky and flapjacks is one of the few things he eats, so pancake house we went.
We were there before 9am on Saturday and got ourselves a table right away. I saw a few seasonal pancake specials on the board (ex. Pumpkin pancakes). I was trying to get into a pancake mood... but then I realize I may have stumbled on something special. But before I got too excited then highly disappointed, I asked if the ENTIRE menu up for grab that morning, AND the waitress said YES!  
My friend, they have Spam Scramble served with rice and a side. SPAM SCRAMBLE! There was no need to even consider anything else. I decided to try their garlic rice instead of plain white rice. I chose a side of macaroni salad. I even ordered a side of their \"country gravy\" (think thick brown gravy).  Best $7.95 (plus $1 for garlic rice and $0.75 for gravy) ever spent on breakfast.
NOW - be warned, they aren't messing with the garlic. I could have fought Dracula himself with the amount of garlic I had on my breath. But it was good. The eggs were fluffy, mixed in were chunks of Spam-goodness. They sprinkled a little of furikake all over. At the end I mixed in some of the gravy with the rice. It was legit.
Highly recommend this place, and by gosh, not just for the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Wife called to place an order to go.  First, they put her on hold, then hung up on her.  When we called back, they said \"we are too busy right now, call back in 15 min\".  Wow, if they can't even take a to go order, I wonder what the inside looks like."}
{"text":"I liked BabyStacks, but it's not a place I would be dying to go to. I definitely heard too much hype about this place. 

I came here with four of my cousins and we all ordered from the \"breakfast favorites\" section of the menu that came with pancakes and we all ordered different kinds of pancakes and sampled from each other's plates.

I ordered Cora's corned beef hash and eggs and got the Cinnabun pancakes. The portion of rice in the order definitely was not enough, so I had to order an extra side of rice. Everything was cooked well though! My pancakes were delicious in flavor, but they were overwhelmingly dry for my taste. I also tried the red velvet, carrot cakes, banana cream pie, and chocolate chip pancakes, which were all also quite dry, but still tasty. 

Overall, this place was cute and everything tasted good, but I came here expecting a lot more."}
{"text":"Yes to the red velvet pancakes! Great friendly service. Worth the wait. They turn over tables fast."}
{"text":"First time at BabyStacks and we'll be back for sure! The menu has so many options, including of course, the many pancake options! It's hard to choose!
I had the cookies and cream pancakes and if you like sweet things, these are amazing! It tasted like an Oreo in a pancake! I got the short stack which has 3 pancakes, with cream cheese syrup! 
My husband got the Kalua Pork Benedict which he said  was pretty good but wouldn't get again. Not enough flavour. 
Excited to go back though and try something else!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 3 times in 4 weeks....which for us is impressive. We love the red velvet pancakes!! Oh my goodness! Our goal is to try every pancake. 
  I also typically order Roy's omelette which is chicken adobo minced with rice then wrapped in an omelette. Though the last time I ordered this to go and the rice wasn't fully cooked. I'm positive they would have fixed this if I was eating in. 
   Anyway, try this place!"}
{"text":"I drove 20 minutes away from Los Angeles on a Sunday morning just to try out the pancakes and was not disappointed!! The only disappointment was I didn't have enough stomach room to down the red velvet AND s'mores pancakes so I had to settle with just the red velvet pancakes and adobe fried rice.  The cream cheese syrup is probably what makes the pancakes delicious-yo...I'm not even a huge fan of red velvet or cream cheese but these were so amazingly decadent that I had to bring a batch back to LA with me.  The fried rice was also yummy and balanced out the sweet pancakes well.

The dining area is small but the staff was so friendly and quick to service to us non-locals. I was impressed at the amount of people that filled up the place at 7:30 am on a Sunday and the place was 100% filled when we left.  One day I may be back if I could find some crazy person who will stay up until it opens, or go to bed early enough to wake up for it. The former sounds like the more fitting option for Vegas, don't you think??"}
{"text":"This place has a cute atmosphere with nice wall decors and Hawaiian music.  The staff were mellow.  The red velvet pancakes were really delicious - not too sweet,  not too thick,  chocolate powder layered over, nice light fluffy whipped cream, and sweet sugar glazed syrup.  I had side fruits - too much mushy cantaloupe.  I am looking forward to come back to try other things."}
{"text":"I was very excited for a breakfast place in mountains edge, unfortunately this place fell a little short. I ordered take out, Bacon pancakes and Nutella pancakes. The food was ok, the bacon pancake was something very different I have never tried before but the Nutella pancake was a not tasty at all.. it was really dry."}
{"text":"The Loco Moco, sausage patties and corned beef hash were delicious; the red velvet pancakes were average but satisfying and very affordable."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the Banana Fosters pancakes are by far the best pancakes I have ever had! Adobo fried rice was awesome, get it made with the garlic rice, and the chili moco on garlic rice was to die for. Christopher our waiter was one of the best waiters I have ever had, he knows the tastes of all the foods and can recommend what your tastebuds are looking for. Great food, great service, a nice little gem in the south west."}
{"text":"When it's busy, and they put your name on the list, watch like a hawk. Maybe photograph your name on the list. Waited the half hour we were told the wait would be... then had the same guy that wrote my name down, ask for my name to put it on the list; because it was. Not. There. Are you freaking kidding me?

We have gone to Babystacks twice now, both times had a fair wait before, which we expected. What was not expected, was what I mentioned above. We walked in, were in a line of people getting their names on \"The List\" of people waiting for a table. The younger guy asked if we wanted a table, of course we did, so we said so. He asked how many, and for a name. We told him \"2 - Chris\" - His reply, \"Ok, it should be 25-30 minutes,\" Said while he wrote down my name.

Half hour later, we're sitting on the bench waiting patiently, he walks up, clipboard in hand, and again asks us, \"Did you want a table? I have to put your name on the list.\" 

Blank stares.

Yes, we would like a table, that's why WE GAVE YOU OUR NAME HALF HOUR AGO. He glances at the list, said we weren't on it, so we would have to go to the bottom of the list. His co-worker sensed our instant, growing anger, and said we would get the next table. Thank you, ma'am!

A couple moments later, we were seated with menus. 

It took a little while, but our server, the same lady as our first visit, walked past, said hello and she would be right with us. Six back and forth trips later, she dropped off some water, and eventually stopped by to see if we wanted more than water, and to take our order. 

Now, I have been known to be hyper-logical in the past, so when reading the menu, I had a question and asked the server, who, one would think, would have at least an attempt at a satisfactory reply.

My observation / question was thus:
Order of Biscuits & Gravy: $6.50
Order of B&G with 2 eggs: $7.50
Order of B&G with sausage: $8.50

Order of B&G with 2 eggs AND sausage: $10.50

Why is it four dollars more to get both items, when individually, there is only a three dollar increase in price?

Her response? \"It might be a glitch in the menu or the computer.\"

What?!

I instead, went with another item, and tried their chicken fried steak and eggs, with hash browns, for $11.95. When the food arrived, it was a small serving of hash browns, a standard, frozen/fried CFS, and some watery fried eggs (not sure if it was water, they were very wet, and not from grease/butter/oil - or the standard egg goo).

Either the gravy, or the CFS was rather... floury. Most likely the gravy. Which, by the way, was not the best gravy around. I've had better (at Carl's Jr no less), and I have had much worse (pretty much everywhere).

For twelve bucks, I would have liked to feel full after the meal, or at least, satisfied. It was mediocre food overall. 

I may go back and try the pancakes themselves, when I am in the mood for pancakes. Otherwise, there are tastier, more inexpensive places to get a good breakfast in the morning."}
{"text":"Stay away. Worst breakfast ever. Staff is very rude. Very slow service. Would rather eat at McDonald's"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this weekend with our two kids (9 months and 2.5 years) The servers were great, polite, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  My daughter really liked the butterflies on the wall.  
The food is adequately priced which is great for breakfast.  They are known for their pancakes which I would stick with they were very good :)"}
{"text":"Holy smokes do you need to come here. But get here early or pick a weekday for lunch.

The service is amazing, prices great, food fresh, diverse menu, clean, nice music, not too loud, free and easy parking. Awesome to have the Hawaiian influence. 

Go go go, and enjoy."}
{"text":"My Mom and I recently had brunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  It pains me to only give them one star, since we enjoyed our food.  That is, until my Mom found a short and curly in her pancake.

We arrived around 1pm and it was not busy.  We were lucky to find no wait and were immediately seated.

Although it was not busy, it took our server about 15 minutes to approach us.  Although we were ready to order food, she only took our drink orders.  Once we eventually placed our food order my Mom even commented \"I can only imagine how long our food will take after that.\"  Yikes.

Luckily, our food did not take near as long.  My Mom ordered the senior breakfast with sausage links, eggs over easy and a short stack.  This is a decent deal and was far too much food for her. She actually gave the eggs and hashbrowns to me.

I ordered the banana cream pie pancakes, which were really delicious.  The short stack is plenty filling.  I loved the sliced bananas, whipped cream and banana cream sauce topping.

Other than the slow service, everything was great....until my Mom discovered a hair (that didn't belong to either of us) in her pancakes.  We were both almost done with our meals and immediately lost our appetites.

We immediately cashed out.  I would normally inform the manager of the hair, but we were in a hurry and hadn't expected breakfast to take as long as it did.  I know this happens from time to time.....I would still go back, and will update my review accordingly after that."}
{"text":"Great place first time for me food awesome and the service is good definitely will back and try something else. ."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee.  Excellent breakfast.  Excellent pancakes.  There is a reason this place is always busy...  but remember they don't split checks."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is the best. I've been here 3 times in the past week and have gotten the Adobo twice. It's amazing if you like island flavors. Very Savory. Recommend upgrading your side to a special baby stack. So far every one I have tried has be delicious. 

Your moms gunna love this place- at least that's what she told me when I saw her last night"}
{"text":"Breakfast was great!  We shared the fried rice omelette, which came with a couple of pancakes.  We upgraded the pancakes to the oreo one.  Everything tasted yummy.  Service was also really good.  I thought the fried rice omelette was a novel idea, and I am gonna try and make one at home.  The fried rice had portuguese sausage, mushrooms and bacon inside.    I wish the ingredients were cut a bit bigger.  They were diced really small.  That would be my only suggestion.  Overall, I think it was a great value and appreciated we could have both salty and sweet in one entree."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot! I like that you can choose to have a skillet or an omelette. Service is nice. We will be back to try the different pancakes...so many options."}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G!! If u r here on vacation and staying on the strip, you have to eat here. Everything is different and unique which makes this my favorite place to eat in Vegas.  As a local, I have yet to find another breakfast place that comes close.  Try their pancakes. Promise u will not b disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Vegas , this has been my favorite . My wife and I frequent this place very often . The people are so nice and the food is always amazing . I would recommend for a family breakfast . The only thing is they close at 1pm I believe . We always get there early anyway . 
I got the Mexican skillet with banana cream waffles and she gets the chili moko with cookies and cream pancakes ."}
{"text":"Wonderful attentive service and delicious food. The hazelnut pancakes are out of this world delish!"}
{"text":"Went on a very busy Saturday morning, wait was surprisingly only ten minutes. Service was exceptional and very quick, we were going in n out in about, if not less than an hour. Food was amazing!! I've never had such a good stack of pancakes (cookies n cream), definitely made me want to go back to try all the different kinds they had. Chili omelet was amazing, especially with the potatoes!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with a Hawaiian flair. The staff has always been very helpful and attentive. I recommend this place without reservation."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 with 2 kids not Greeted pleasantly by the host.  She seemed unhappy and not even smiled at us.  We ordered our food and waited and waited after 30 minutes half of our food came out.  We waited about 8 minutes for the rest of the food to be served.  This is not acceptable as far as a breakfast timeline.  I've been to the other baby stacks location and their service is great.  This is the second horrible experience at this location.  Sad that the food is great but the staff needs to be reevaluated."}
{"text":"Gr8 breakfast place in near Desert Shores.  Hawaiian owned.  Egg dishes, pancakes, crepes-all top notch.  Kahlua pig eggs benedict, red velvet pancakes and nutella crepes are good.  Service is fine and portions are generous.  Decent prices.  A little congested and noisy."}
{"text":"Came back the next morning to try different menu items.  This time brought the parents and we were a party of 4.  We arrived around 10am and were told it would be a 20 min. wait.  We decided to go for it since we know it was worth the wait.  We were seated right around 20-25 mins. later.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem as we were told how long the wait was, but we were seeing parties of 2, 3, and 4 that arrived after us being seated before us at 4 top tables.  Once we were seated, we promptly were greated by our server Eric.  He took our drink orders and brought them out fairly quickly.  Our orders were placed and this is where things went a little south.  We didn't get our food until after 11:10am.  When our food arrived, my pancakes were missing.  Eric advised me they were working on them.  In the meantime, my mom had spilled her maple syrup and had asked for another.  Eric never brought the syrup back so she only ate about half of the pancakes.  After another 10 mins. after receiving our food, my pancakes had not yet arrived and I had finished my eggs benedict.  Every one else was nearing being done eating as well.  I flagged down Eric and let him know he could cancel the pancakes.  He apologized and said he would take them off the bill.  The pancakes were actually the side to my Benedict, so there was nothing to remove from the bill and when we got the bill, nothing was taken off.  The time is now 11:35am and we have to be at a noon appointment, so we quickly paid and left.  If this was my first experience here, I would have rated it 3 stars, but because I know service can differ day to day and the day before was point on, I'm only going to remove one star."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a little weary about eating here, I'm picky when it comes to breakfast but when my boyfriend and I came here I left feeling full and satisfied. 

My boyfriend likes a specific combination for breakfast and they actually were able to accommodate with him & didn't deny what he wanted. He got the homemade cornbeef hash with poached eggs on biscuits and drizzled with hollindaise sauce. ( Irish Benedict ) he was happy they accommodated what he wanted. 

I was impressed with their omelette! I got bacon, cheese, spinach & mushroom. Everything came out hot, which is good! The hash browns were a little bland, definetly needed seasoning & we wish they were more crispy! 

Red velvet pancakes were on point!! 

We will be coming back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh cooked foods. My daughter loves the red velvet pancakes. My grandson is a banana freak ;). The mac nut/white chocolate pancakes are my fav. Rest of their breakfast foods ie omeletyes ect are great too. I gave this five stars because the food is awesome, my only complaint.. This place is way to tiny, always 100% occupancy because of the small quarters.. Alittle loud due to this..But so worth the food and wait!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised it isn't your standard pancake house. There are many unexpected Hawaiian and Filipino dishes as well! The garlic rice is to die for. I had the loco moco and my husband ate the kahlua grilled cheese. Both were fantastic. Will be back"}
{"text":"We found this place via Yelp and decided to give it a try.

I had the carrot cake pancake stack (short - I have no idea how hungry you would have to be to consume the full stack!) and a side of the Portugese sausage.

The pancakes had a great flavor, not too sweet, and the cream cheese syrup was also great, but I wish there was more of it as it didn't cover all three pancakes in the short stack.

The Portugese sausage had good flavor (and was a generous portion) I am not sure it went with the pancakes I ordered, but I wanted to try something unusual - the sausage is kind of like kielbasa I would say, or perhaps a chorizo.

The prices of the pancakes were very reasonable and I would go back and try some of the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was a bit skeptical about the red velvet pancakes since the pictures on yelp didn't look that appetizing... But we ordered it anyway and it was delicious! Soft, moist, and tasted just like red velvet! We also got the Kalua pig Benedict and the regular eggs/bacon/pancakes, etc. all in all, the food was great and even though it takes a little more effort to get here since it's off the strip, it's definitely worth it. There wasn't much of a wait since we came on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Great pancakes and always busy. Come if u have time to wait 20-30 mins ahead of time. ..I will say the quality of the orange juice is poor. You would think for doing such great business they would invest in better OJ. Also the server should know, it is impolite to hand the check over to the lady. ...If you're unsure put it in the middle. 4 stars, the OJ killed it."}
{"text":"A great little breakfast place.  Had the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice omelet.  Both good.  The pancakes were over the top.  Coffee was good, too.  Only kick on the place was that I couldn't connect to their wireless with the iPad or iPhone.  Luckily I was able to connect to the casino next door long enough to download a book from Amazon.

The people were very friendly, too."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times now and each time has been absolutely amazing.  I have always had the best customer service and the food has always been super delicious.   I usually get Portuguese rice with eggs and a side of macadamia chocolate chip pancakes(my favorite).  I have tried the orange-cicle pancakes and they are also really good.  It can get really busy here, but the wait has never been longer than 10 min for me.  Definitely worth giving it a shot if you have never been here.  Keep in mind that they close at 3pm, so there is no dinner time."}
{"text":"I wanted some pancakes and heard this is the place to go. I picked the blueberry short stack because it seemed like the only item that wouldn't give me diabetes. It's the middle of summer, when cartons of fresh blueberries are widely available for cheap and Babystacks is using frozen blueberries in their pancakes? Really? That, and the batter tasted bland. Like any other chain restaurant pancake. Although $6 for breakfast isn't bad. Come early (8am) and beat the crowd."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place.  Lolos Adobo Fried Rice is their signature breakfast dish.  This time I ordered the huevos rancheros with carnitas.   It was just ok.  My friend ordered breakfast burrito with chicken and bacon and he said it was very good."}
{"text":"Like family cooking?   This is the closest to great at home flavor with a menu which has a lot of variety.  I had the Portuguese Fried Rice and My wife had Adobo Fried Rice.  Great taste and great service as well.  We would return."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here as it was around the corner from a friend's house. The wait for a party of four was about 10 minutes. We ordered the Portuguese sausage fried rice which contained green and white onion, sliced mushroom, bacon AND Portuguese sausage all wrapped in an egg omelette. You are given the option of omelette style or eggs on the side or on top of fried rice. You also have the option of a side of pancakes, hash browns or toast. 
Another person ordered the Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice platter. The plate contained 2 eggs, one scoop of rice, 6 slices of Portuguese sausage and a side of red velvet pancakes. 
Service was fast and efficient, it would be nice if they wore name tags as that would add a more personable experience. Our group did NOT feel rushed. 
Also, tea was Stash brand with unlimited hot water refill."}
{"text":"Ooooo baby baby ooooo baby baby! I decided to throw in some Sal-N-Pepa for ya'll. This cafe spot serves a lot of different style of pancakes from banana to red velvet to s'mores! Yeah, s'mores and even rocky road! Seems more like dessert if you ask me. But, heck, why not have dessert for breakfast!

I had the banana short stack pancakes with egg whites and home potatoes. It pretty good! No real complaints...only thing is that I felt I was eaten small french fries with the potatoes :p.

The red velvet pancakes my boyfriend got tasted like a flat cake lol...but then again, that's what a pancake is, somewhat.

Friendly service, you get in and out quick, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My family and I usually go out to breakfast on Saturday, but this time we decided on takeout. I looked up Babystacks Cafe online since it's close by us in Mountain's Edge and we were enticed by the variety of delectable breakfast fare on the online menu. They have so many delicious pancakes available. We ordered banana cream pie pancakes, steak and eggs, and two egg breakfast. We would recommend placing names on the to-go orders, my husband called from the restaurant to see what we ordered. It was nice to be able to substitute rice for potatoes, and the entrees include buttermilk pancakes. We were highly satisfied with our meals and will definitely order take out breakfast again or eat in at Babystacks Cafe."}
{"text":"This place is really good

The Red Velvet pancakes were like an excellent dessert 

The Macadamia White Chocolate pancakes were excellent, not as sweet as the RV

I loved the Huntington omelet, it had my favorites: avocado, bacon, cheddar

Server Yvette was attentive and fun.  I highly recommend this place.
Was not crowded at 11am on a Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices and yummy food ! Without a doubt gotta get the red velvet pancakes! The are the best here!! I love the Hawaiian influence in most of the dishes! Loco mocos , sausage fried rice! My favorite is the kalua pig eggs Bennie ! Great portions and good service! Bomb dot com breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"It's like I died and went to pancake breakfast heaven.

I wish there was such as place.  However, this place will do.

This place made me wish I could eat more and I can already eat a lot.  Luckily this was easy access from the hotel I was staying at and I could justify the eleventy-billion calories I was about to consume a couple days after the World's Toughest Mudder.  I wanted pancakes and French Toast.

Tuesday at about 7:15 in the morning the small little restaurant was pretty empty and I was greeted immediately by a very kind server.  She gave me a few minutes to decide on what I wanted which I had already planned out but with so many choices, I was still hesitant.

I opted for the Rocky Road Pancakes (Half-Stack) and the Cookie Butter French Toast...because who doesn't love Cookie Butter?

Overall the Rocky Road pancakes were really good, albeit they tasted a bit on the dry side, kind of like a brownie that had lost a little of its moisture.  Looking back, I feel like maybe I should have opted for the German Chocolate Cake Pancakes instead.  The Cookie Butter French Toast was fantastic though, and I had no problem wolfing that down.

The coffee was pretty bad though.  Not sure how that happened.  Without sweetener it tasted like dishwater.  Not sure how I know that either.  However, I overlooked that due to the pancakes, French Toast and friendliness of my server.

Babystacks is definitely on the top of my list for breakfast in the area and that's saying something considering my hotel offered free breakfast.  If I need to stay in the area again, I'll definitely be back, I'll just skip the coffee next time."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I'm biased, but its still great. Spam n eggs wit a small kine chocolate n peppermint pancake...so good. can't go wrong with island reggae playin on the stereo."}
{"text":"I was weary of the hype, but it truly is as good as everyone says. I'm not a fan of Hawaiian food, but this is delicious. I had the adobo omelette and the red velvet pancakes based on the reviews.  I'm glad i split both with someone because the portions were huge and the prices were lower than other breakfast places."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. I was there just this morning. Service was fast and pleasant. Cowboy omelette was a little over cooked on the outside... browned. Cooked ham, fresh onions and green bell peppers tasted good. The cheddar cheese seemed a little processed. Hash browns were good, but there were a couple of dark specs that were from scraping the griddle in there. They made for some nasty tasting surprises. The omelette was supposedly made with 4 eggs. They must have been small eggs. I have to say the amount of food was good, but over priced. $9-10 for two egg breakfast is beyond reasonable for the amount of food served. They benefit from lack of competition and are always busy."}
{"text":"They are open today but they are not taking customers.  How do you expect to run a business if you're not taking customers?  Plus, they didn't even give a reason.  They just said they're not taking customers."}
{"text":"Amazing place and food! Love every location! The pancakes as well as fruit are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. You might have to wait but it is worth it. I had the Honey French Toast combo. I highly recommend it. Service was excellent even though they were very busy.  Hubby had his usual eggs and they were cooked just right."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  I will be visiting again next time I am in vegas.  It was so hard to choose from this menu because everything sounded so good so my two friends and I basically ordered a feast to share.  From the mocha chip pancakes to the adobo fried rice and spam sliders.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Just so you know, they won't seat your entire party until they're all there. They might make exceptions but who knows. This time, I wanted to get the S'mores pancakes but my friend beat me to it. Instead, I wanted the Rocky Road pancakes, but the second friend ALSO beat me to it. That automatically leaves me with the Banana Cream Pie pancakes! There. Good thing I didn't bring a third friend. =_=;

I'll always order the SHORT order cause I can't even finish three pancakes. Not now, not ever. I'm not sure what other one I'll try and I really haven't tried their other breakfast dishes since I feel like going through most of their pancake flavors. I've only ever ordered sausage links and they've never failed me (at breakfast joints).

If you're a fan of banana cream pie overall, go for this flavor! It'll be a fun adventure to try their flavors =b."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked BabyStacks a long time ago and finally decided to make the drive up to give it a try. When I arrived there was a line out the door, but we expected a wait. After about 30 minutes, we were finally seated. I noticed a few things that they could improve on right away. The hostess was rather cold, when people are waiting for extended periods of time for a table, kindness and a smile go a long way. They also have a very small counter area, which I assumed was an option when you placed your name on the list. To my surprise, two couples walked in and went right to the counter! They didn't even tell us that it was first come first served, you don't have to add your name to the list for counter seating! Again, they need to get better control over that because we were not the only group that was upset when we realized this. We waited 30 minutes and two couples walked right in and sat down.They should have everyone add their name to the list and then offer the counter as it becomes available.

Now, onto the food! I got a short stack of their famous red velvet pancakes! As stated by many other yelpers, they were so dreamy! They were moist, delicious, and the cream cheese syrup was divine. They are a little sweet, but not so much that you feel like you are eating cupcakes for breakfast. The short stack was the perfect size, I cleaned my plate but I was definitely full. I was also able to sneak a bite of my husband's banana cream pie pancakes, which were just as tasty.

I was also lucky enough to try their Kalua pig Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was out of this world and worked very well with the rest of the dish. The shredded pork and cabbage were fantastic and overall the dish was very well balanced. They also have delicious seasoned potatoes and hash browns that seem simple but are a really flavorful accompaniment.

Overall, the food is fantastic! I love the way that they designed the menu, almost everything you order comes with pancakes. Unfortunately, they have a few kinks to work out, but the food is so worth the wait. I wish they would open a location in Henderson so I could work them into my weekend brunch routine!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after flying into Vegas. The service was fast , the potatoes and pancakes were really good but the egg were a bit over cooked and the ham was a bit too salty. I would want to give this place another shot to taste test something else. The potatoes are fire though."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and great comfort food. It's a gem that only locals would know at a great price. I'd would definitely go again."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for breakfast in Vegas and it's not a buffet! We had to drive away from the strip to have this food! We came in and barely beat the morning rush. We were able to get seat right before an entire softball team came by. 

I ordered the Kalua Pig omlette. The BF ordered the adobo fried rice omlette. We barely spoke to each other because it was that good. I don't know why we thought we can order a stack of pancakes to share because both of these dishes were overwhelming. The BF usually can eat up a storm but he even had to take half of it home. If you came to eat then this is the dish for you. I had the Kalua Pig Omlette and the pork was cooked perfectly. It just melted in my mouth! 

Good service, great food, what else can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Sunday was my first visit here. My friends hyped this place up for being \"authentic\". I really wanted to like it but unfortunately my order was anything but authentic. 

I spent many years in Hawaii and Guam and I've had really awesome loco moco and Portuguese sausage. 

First off the hamburger patty in my loco moco was not fresh or homemade. The Patty looked too perfect and too proportionate to be fresh ground and hand made. I make my own hand made burgers patties and I know exactly what fresh ground homemade patties look and taste like. I would put my money on the fact that their hamburger patties are frozen and typical processed store bought patties. The kind that look like well proportioned hockey pucks. 

Secondly, The Portuguese sausage was more like turkey sausage. It was not authentic by any means. It was dry, lacking in flavor and spice, and certainly was NOT authentic Hawaiian Portuguese sausage.

Lastly, the wait time at this place was ridiculous. Considering the quality of my food, it is not worth the long wait and I would not recommend this place to anyone expecting classic Hawaiian comfort food. 

On a more positive note, their red velvet pancakes were pretty awesome. Stick to pastries and baked goods and leave the Hawaiian comfort food to the experts."}
{"text":"I wish there was a place like this in So Cal!  My husband and I were in Vegas and on the way to Death Valley.  We wanted to find a GOOD breakfast spot that wasn't a buffet or touristy place on the strip.  We found this place on Yelp and were lured in by the red velvet pancakes and eggs benedicts.

We got there at about 10:30 am on a Friday morning and waited about 20 minutes for a table. I noticed that the menu and the music (island reggae) in the restaurant has a Hawaiian theme.  I saw Kahlua pig and Loco Moco on the menu - and they're particularly Hawaiian food. 

I ordered the Kahlua pig eggs benedict, and my husband ordered the country benedict.  We ordered a half stack of red velvet pancakes, which ended up arriving a bit before our two plates.  

I'm actually not a big fan of pancakes, but I ate those pancakes like a starved person!  I loved that they were soft and moist and tasted like what I hoped red velvet pancakes would taste like - and not like I was eating a overly sweet cake like I was afraid I might be.  But like red velvet cake or cupcakes, it's more about the soft and moist texture along with what makes the cake - the cream cheese frosting.  The cream cheese frosting/syrup wasn't too sweet and pour out on the pancakes about the consistency of ranch salad dressing.  The little chocolate chips sprinkled on top were definitely made the pancakes irresistible. 

As for the Kahlua benedict, they were good but not great.  When in Hawaii, Kahlua pig is one of my favorite things to eat.  Even living in So Cal, I've never found any Hawaiian place that has ever done Kahlua pig the way it's done in Hawaii.  Carnitas at some authentic Mexican restaurants are probably the closest, but still not the same. I was a bit disappointed with my benedicts since they also had a lot of cabbage in them, giving the Kahlua pig a slight bitter taste rather than the juicy pig taste I was hoping for.  The Kahlua pig tasted pretty bland otherwise, and was a bit soggy rather than meaty like I hoped.

As for my husband's country benedict, it tasted I guess as it should - like country fried steak with eggs.

As for the hash browns (I didn't wanna risk ordering the potatoes, since I've rarely found a restaurant that did breakfast potatoes well), they were perfect. It was fried to a perfect crispiness on one side and moist and potatoey on the inside.  These were probably some of the best hash browns I've ever had!

Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would definitely make the 20 min trip off the strip to go there again next time I'm in Vegas. I'm certain a breakfast place like this would do really well in So Cal. :)"}
{"text":"Love to find good breakfast spots!  This place has lots of pancakes and they all sounded good.  I tried the Red Velvet and Banana Creme Pie.  Both were good but needed more topping as they were a bit dry.  I look forward to trying more varieties on the next visit. 

Service was very good, especially considering the high volume of customers."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Great food! Amazing red velvet pancakes. The waiter was awesome got us exactly what we wanted and needed. 
I recommend this place and I'm definitely coming back. 
I would of took a pic of the delicious meal but I was took hungry and it just looked and was so delicious"}
{"text":"Service is great and the banana cream pie pancakes are AMAZING  oh bacons alright tho"}
{"text":"Just went here today, heard about how busy this place gets on the weekends so I'm glad I came on a weekday afternoon, but good for them because it is great how a local business is rockin it!  The service was spot on and the food was amazing.  I loved watching the plates come off the line.  I didn't know that it was Hawaiian owned and the Hawaiian plates on the menu were a pleasant surprise because I love all things Hawaiian.  

Husband had the deliciously yummy banana cream pancakes, I had the kahlua pig eggs benedict.  I love eggs benedict and pride myself on knowing if a hollandaise sauce is freshly made or not.  This one was.  I could drink the stuff.  Anyway, overall this place had great service and awesome food so support this little local business."}
{"text":"Their pancake combinations sound better than they taste. I don't know why they are rated so high. The red velvet pancakes I got were burnt, the diced potatoes tasted like they were store bought from the frozen section, the omelet was ok."}
{"text":"Such good food and great service! This is the one place I always bring family and friends when they come into town! We've been quite a few times now, and it only gets better the more you go! Nothing we've had so far has been anything less than delicious! There's usually a wait when we arrive, but I promise it's worth the patience!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new today. This was definitely a huge hit for us. I had the Ham and Eggs platter which came with 2 buttermilk babystack pancakes. My husband had the bacon pancakes in a short stack along with Sausage Links. The Ham came out extremely greasy and needed to be patted down with a napkin but it had good flavor. The egg platters have an option of being served with hash browns, seasoned potatoes or rice.  The bacon pancakes are garnished not only with bacon but have bacon bits inside them too. Everything was excellent and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Officially the #3 Reason to go to Las Vegas after a convention and a vacation. I'm not a pancakes fan or a breakfast fan or a sweets fan. That being said the last time I went there I got 2 orders , Red Velvet and Bananas Foster Pancakes. When People mention Las Vegas I plan my off strip plans around BabyStacks."}
{"text":"RED VELVET PANCAKES with whip cream and mini chocolate chips!! 

I'm a sucker for red velvet pancakes!

Finally went to Babycakes this past Friday :D
My friend/high school classmate was visiting from Florida so I wanted to take him to a yummy breakfast spot! I've been wanting to try Babycakes for the last 2 months and have been waiting for someone to visit me in town so I could experience Babycakes with someone else. I didn't realize that Babycakes is 8 miles north of me... but it was worth the drive!

Came in around 10am... no wait.
We both ordered the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice... I got the red velvet pancakes and my friend got the white chocolate chip mac nut pancakes. Both pancakes were delicious and you can't go wrong with the local favorite portuguese sausage eggs and rice.

I would love to come back again... when more friends visit me in town again. 

Pay your bill at the counter. casual dining. stress free parking. good customer service.

If you're visiting Vegas or a local... make Babycakes on your to eat list!

I'll be back for more!!!

Aloha...

{"text":"I am a noob stackers fan.  The g/f is somewhat of an aficionado but our first unofficial \"date\" was at #1 and 5 months later we are still dating.  The coupon was an awesome deal and the meal was great!  Part of my criteria in ANY BUSINESS is if I like their logo and the fonts they choose and their menu layout.  Yes, I am a designer by trade.  Great logo and menu layout was good.  Service was good.  They play Pandora which is great.  It is also in my hood so an after-brick workout (swim, bike and run) will make this a fav place to replenish."}
{"text":"This has easily became my new favorite breakfast place. Always a nice and welcoming vibe from the workers even when busy. They literally have something for everyone on their menu including the various flavors of pancakes. I usually just stick with my basic breakfast(eggs,sausage, whatever pancake I'm in the mood for).. Although I've recently discovered the Portuguese fried rice omelet and it has changed the game for me! It's been a while since I've gone to a restaurant and fell in love with something on the menu, 10/10 recommend you try it out. Makes me sad they're only open until 2-3pm because I crave it everyday now!!"}
{"text":"Ok, wow!  Yum!  

This is a solid breakfast spot with a very large selection of flavored pancakes.  At first, I was a little skeptical because the menu is so large but the pancakes alone were fluffy and extremely tasty.  

I love the fact that they have a lot of flavor profiles that I crave from my childhood.  I'm Filipina and I love the fact that they serve garlic rice here.  I also was telling my friend this story about how in high school there was a special class that sold breakfasts of fried rice omelets and Portuguese sausage and I would be so excited when my class was able to go.  Looks like I have a place like that I can go to now as an adult.

While nothing is too groundbreaking, I think the flavors and quality of food are solid.

We went on a Monday morning and it was actually quite busy but our server was attentive and we got both food, drinks and the check very quickly."}
{"text":"We waited around 45 minutes for a table for 10 of us. I ordered a skillet with bacon, spinach, onions, and Swiss cheese. And I substituted the pancakes for the red velvet pancakes. It was very good. I got to try my son's lemon ricotta pancake and I did not like that one at all. It tasted off to me and it kind of reminds me of lemon Pine Sol, even tough I don't consume household cleaners."}
{"text":"The food is always good! I love the red velvet pancakes and the garlic rice. Make sure you don't come too hungry because the wait is usually pretty long!"}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed this place before. I've eaten here 3 times over the past 2 years. First meal was Kahlua benedict which I enjoyed a lot. Next trip was lemon ricotta pancakes, which were a bit doughy and undercooked. This trip I went with the sweet cream crepes add banana. Very tasty with the cream cheese filling, but the crepes themselves were a little chewy. Crepes should be light and crispy.

I had an ice tea which tasted like water, with virtually no tea flavor. Not good. 

Service is always good, looks like the same crew of waitresses as my last two visits so they keep staff around which makes for consistency in service. 

The menu here is full of delicious treats, with a hawaiian/filipino flair. I just wish the food, especially the pancakes, were of a higher quality."}
{"text":"I went back here a few days ago to experience the pancakes, since that's what they are known for. The restaurant was mildly busy, with a large group of 12 just having sat down minutes before me....which might be the reason for this review.

I had the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were not cooked well, in fact two of the 3 weren't cooked all the way through. This was very disappointing to me. Service was great again, food arrived on time (after the party of 12). Just not cooked well...and that is not expected. I might give them one more try but I expect better."}
{"text":"The service was good, and seating was limited but the wait wasn't too long. I ordered the steak and eggs, with red velvet pancakes. The pancakes were really tasty, but the steak and eggs could have been better at a casino after midnight for 2.99"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Sunday which meant it was pretty crowded.  We got seated and it was pretty warm inside.  Got our drinks ok, ordered, and it was getting really warm...asked the server why it was so hot in there.  Response was, \"Oh, the a/c is broken\". What!  Why don't they tell you that before they seat you?  You think as a courtesy they would tell you that instead of just trying to get your business and make you suffer in the heat.  Got our orders and when they brought the butter packet for my pancakes, it was melted and literally dripping out of the packet.  How healthy or appealing is that!  Will really think twice about going back there again when there are alot of good restaurants in the area..."}
{"text":"Super cute little breakfast/brunch joint with a pretty unique menu - not your standard generic breakfast. I was excited to try the red velvet pancakes, which did live up to the hype. They're so pretty and fluffy with great flavor. Even just a half stack is more than enough, I think the full would've been too much of a good thing.
Wheat French toast kind of looks more like pork chops in my pic, but its actually thick slabs of bread dipped in a corn flake crust for a really different texture. I was excited to try their French toast based on the description, but it was a little dry and overwhelmingly sweet to me. I ended up just having 1 piece. 
I didn't try my friend's strawberry crepe, but presentation was pretty. Service was surprisingly bad despite it being pretty slow. I'm always a little shocked when little homey restaurants like this don't provide good service. There were maybe 10 tables max with 2 or 3 servers working. The waitress was sweet and nice, but I almost had to beg her for a 3rd place setting. We also ceased to exist once the food came, had to beg again for a refill of their watered down coffee. Tried unsuccessfully twice to flag her down to pay the bill, only to be told that she didn't do that - we had to pay up front. 
I really wanted to love this place because it was so cute, but I don't think ill be back. Just have to be on the lookout for another place w red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out since I've heard so many good things. Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. Let's start off with the service...I personally did not find the workers to be friendly. The hostess was very pushy when asking where the rest of my party was when they were right outside of the door! I only found one waitress to be friendly (I forgot to ask for her name) As for the food we got the red velvet pancakes, adobo fried rice, and Mac salad. Their red velvet was just ok, I honestly think IHOP's is better. It just seemed a little cakey if you ask me. The adobo fried rice was just ok and a bit on the salty side. As for the Mac salad it had no taste, it was bland. I would rather have Aloha kitchens Mac salad. So with that being said I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Hands down a great place to eat...enjoyed each bite till the very last one...seating a little crowded but with food this good that didn't matter to much...will be back!"}
{"text":"Server has been great, hostess - disoriented ( placed other couple before us - even though it was our turn)
Food is great except coffee(tastes very cheap )"}
{"text":"This place has made me a BELIEVER!!!  I normally never EVER get pancakes as my breakfast entree, but these are the best pancakes EVERR!!!  These pancakes were light, fluffy and not overly sweet.  My friends and I came here for brunch during our girl's vegas weekend and we were NOT disappointed in the least.  We ordered the red velvet, banana cream pie, and strawberry pancakes and they were all delicious.  My personal fave was the banana cream pie.  All the pancakes were served with homemade whipped cream and the red velvet came with a cream cheese syrup (YUM!!).  Aside from our sweet entrees, we also ordered a side of garlic friend rice and french fries, both were also great.  I am definitely returning next time I'm in vegas!!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and finally decided to check it out. Arrived shortly after noon and the place was packed. I was surprised at how small the place was. The estimated wait time they gave was pretty accurate and we were seated within 20 mins or so. My husband had the red velvet pancakes and loved it. I had the skillet and thought it was pretty good. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with a down home vibe.  The owners are Filipino, who have family in Hawaii, which explains why there are Filipino and Hawaiian selections on the menu. Prices are reasonable, although portions could be bigger.   Service is fast and friendly.

Red velvet pancakes.  Fluffy and thick with that delicious cake flavor you would hope to have.

Portuguese sausage with eggs. 
I was able to get the garlic fried rice with my sausage and eggs.  It was just white rice with very  little flavor."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot hands down! My favorite dish to order is the Mexican skillet, the carnitas are so tender and they have the best potatoes and French fries. I usually order the red velvet or hazelnut pancakes but honestly, you can't go wrong with any pancake here. For lunch I love the turkey and avocado sandwich with French fries and a side of ranch (you have to try it). There usually is a wait time, but trust me it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have gone here and it was even better than the first time!! I had the country Benedict last time and it was amazing. This time I got the corned beef hash with upgraded garlic rice and upgraded to lemon ricotta pancakes. Omg. Seriously perfect and it came out before we even had a chance to finish a game of hangman! Our server was so nice and pleasant too. Favorite breakfast spot in Centennial Hills!!"}
{"text":"I always go to the Babystacks off Durango.  Man, this location is not good.  Been here two times now and the pancakes are not moist or melt in your mouth delicious like the other Babystacks.  Both times my pancakes came out dry and over cooked.  Not coming back here. There's definitely no consistency in the food.  I no longer crave their pancakes because of this."}

-Bright cafe that closes at 2pm

-The food came out fairly quick. 
-Service was extremely friendly.

Food: 3/5
-The pancakes were delicious. We tried the banana cream and the carrot cake. The banana cream was rich and sweet. 
-Most of my party liked the banana cream more than the carrot cake. I liked the carrot cake more. The cream cheese syrup is mmm mmm delicious.
-Rick's Adobo fried rice was my favorite and large enough to share between 2-3 adults.
-The loco moco was too hyped up. Too much brown gravy that masked the flavor of the beef and eggs. Wait, there were eggs? All I noticed was beef patties, rice and gravy. 
-The Portuguese sausage had a distinct taste however nothing to brag home about. It was also very very greasy."}
{"text":"I've come in here before but this time I brought my best friend with me on our way to the airport. The staff is very friendly and the food is big and delicious. We both got the scrambled eggs with corn beef hash and some of their bacon pancakes. Everything was delicious it came out quickly it came out hot and we were very full once we were done.  
The bacon pancakes and syrup were a definite hit !"}
{"text":"I was sick and tired of all the RAVING about Babycakes... So I got my day pack together and saddled up to the journey to Summerlin..... well, I got a ride, but hey!

This place was definitely not as I expected: it's quaint and it aims to be a neighborhood joint... props to them! Thankfully, and to my happiness.... there was no said line.. nor a wait. Also, it was a Wednesday morning, so that should be accounted for. Yesss. So we were seated right away... upon being seated right away.. We were waited right away! 

I'm not going to lie... I came here just for the red velvet pancakes, sorry to disappoint and to OBVIOUSLY jump on the Yelp bandwagon. I was kinda upset I just ordered the pancakes because their menu is huge and original... just another something to bring me back. 

I got the half-stack which was plenty for me. Yet another review... yes. The pancakes are THAT good. Pancake Perfection! How does one make such consistent, fluffy cakes all the time.. day in, day out? The world may never know... My cream cheese icing syrup(?) was put on the side and I used it for dunking rather than drenching. Red velvet Pancakes 4 Lyf.

I will soon be back to indulge in their Hawaiian and Filipino breakfasts so I can get some SPAM.. (i have a secret liking for that stuff) ... at that time I'll hopefully have something else to review... and I can UP my rating:]"}

We also ordered kalbi steak with eggs and garlic rice and the rice was so tasty. All the entrees came with pancakes and pancakes were soooo good"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not a pancake person but I'm obsessed with their pancakes. The food is amazing, the service is great, and the atmosphere is comfortable. Highly recommend it. I will be back every chance I get! :)"}
{"text":"This place is great. I ordered the loco moco.  The meat was very flavorful along with the garlic fried rice it came with. I also ordered the short stack of hazelnut pancakes. They were fire as well!

My girlfriend ordered the adobo fried rice omelette and it was very good. I tried this dish at Aloha Kitchen and the one here at Babystacks puts the one at Aloha Kitchen to shame! The rice was flavorful and not dry. 

Definitely coming back to this place when Im in town!"}
{"text":"This review is not for the pancakes.

Ordered to go today.  Food took a while so I expected it to come out freshly cooked. Got the spinach omelette and breakfast burrito. Asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side. It came on top instead. Extra sauce is 1.25 each. Really don't like places that nickel and dime you for each request. 

Quantities is pretty low compared to the prices. Not alot of has browns. Breakfast burrito was small. Not great. Flavor was ok, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Monday 1039am waited over a half hour for a seat! 9 empty tables! Place is a joke! Service is ok! Food just alright! Hostess is also cashier which adds to the wait time! For the price of food they can afford a hostess and a cashier!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I are in love with Baby Stacks Cafe!!! The omelets and skillets are great with plenty of toppings and unlimited combinations. The buttermilk pancakes are FANTASTIC! The coffee is pretty generic, but still good! We will be returning to this wonderful breakfast shop!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in the Vegas area.  The staff is prompt and friendly.  There's always a huge crowd here, and I think their pancakes are the reason to visit.  There's a boatload of parking, too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here, it's delicious. I give the food a 5 star hands down  but the service is not great. I sometimes think then when a restaurant has good food they act like jerks because they know your gonna be back. You can't split your check no more then 2 people, and they are really rude about that. You can see the annoyance on their face and honestly I think that's just unprofessional. You can tell they get annoyed when it gets crowded but it's a restaurant with amazing food of course it's always going to be packed. I worked at a restaurant and I know at times it can feel overwhelming but this is what You signed up for, so if your gonna work in a restaurant treat your guest nicely."}
{"text":"Great service and interesting things on the menu! This is a solid breakfast or brunch option. Other people must know this since there was about a 30 minute wait when we went on a Saturday. 

The biggest draw may be that they have about 18 different types of pancakes on the menu (bacon, orange creamsicle, hazelnut, you name it). They also have regular eggs, omelets, french toast, etc. I presume the owners are Hawaiian as that seems to be the theme for some things...and there is a hefty Spam presence on the menu. 

I got Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which is basically a chicken fried rice burrito with omelet egg as the wrapper. Cool but not too exciting...I had to drench a bunch of hot sauce on it. Pancakes for me next time."}
{"text":"This is a really unique breakfast/brunch spot, and it's definitely worth the quick drive from the Strip if you'd like to skip those $17.99 breakfast buffets in exchange for trying something new.  Try the Kalua Pig Benedict for a twist on eggs benedict - the combination of Hawaiian shredded pork and cabbage really makes the dish. Or, if you're a fan of pretending to be British and having afternoon tea, order the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  They're crepe-thin with an elegant lemony flavor, and the sides of fresh lemons, cream cheese syrup (way tastier than it sounds,  trust me) and powdered sugar are served prettily arranged on a delicate lacy plate.  You'd expect to pay extra for these fun dishes, but the price compares favorably to chain brunch places, with most entrees items in the $8-12 range.  

I probably won't be back to Vegas for a bit, but when I return, I know where I'll be having brunch!"}
{"text":"One of my fav places to have breakfast in LV. They have fun things in the menu to choose from. If they don't have what you like on the menu, they are most likely able to make it for you if it's breakfast related."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant!! 
Very good food and big/huuuge serving!!! You guys must try the adobo rice omelet!!! The bomb!!! The order is good for 2 persons already! So huge!!"}
{"text":"Always good! Doesn't matter which location you visit! They really do a phenomenal job! I'm a regular to the various locations- I've tried everything and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place.....by far the BEST most delish pancakes I've ver had! Loved every bite, I want to go back again today! My husband got the orange creamsicle pancakes, I got the lemon ricotta. The orange tasted like an orange roll with frosting, the lemon were super moist and flavorful! That cream cheese syrup is to die for! We also ordered the Kalua Eggs Benedict which was very flavorful and eggs were cooked perfectly, the square potatoes are crispy and perfect. We also got a piglet skillet, we literally ate every bit. It was all sooo good!"}
{"text":"Was in town again for SEMA and some races.   Decided to take my friend to Baby Stacks even though he claimed he was so so on pancakes.   Well, we got there and we were lucky enough to get Danielle again.   (More about that later.)   
He had the adobo which was awesome and pancakes, I had the Portuguese Sausage and eggs with carrot cake pancakes.   It was all awesome.   My buddy even commented as he finished his pancakes on how good they were.   What a great breakfast.  
About Danielle, she is a rock star.   She remembered me from the week before.   She kept everything moving, and was super friendly.   She even did what she could to help soothe the baby at the next table who was teething.   She even brought the little one a little something to chew on while the food was being cooked.   To see this type of warm, welcoming behavior is a beautiful thing to see, especially if you are far from home.   Great job.   
Will I be back?   You bet, the next time I roll in to town, I'll be sure to stop by again.   Great job folks."}
{"text":"My wife and I dine at this place at least once a week.  

Great service and nice portions with a good price. 

I'm more biased in ordering their Hawaiian/Filipino breakfasts more than anything else .  I often order the \"Rick's Adobo Fried Rice\" (adobo fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in omelette) or the Loco-Moco (fried egg and hamburger patty on top of white rice smothered with gravy).   You have an option of choosing a side, which can also be any of their options of pancakes.  I am a big fan of the carrot cake pancake.  For a few extra bucks, you can order another side.  I normally order the Portuguese Sausage (cut into several pieces) or a side of Spam (2 per order) to round up my meal... I know this may seem a lot, but I was raised understanding that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  

Needless to say, I like this place A LOT.  I highly suggest anyone try this place, at least once."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. When paying, MAX was of no help at the register. Rolling his eyes and had an attitude. Maybe he woke up on the wrong side of the bed."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you're looking for something better then the traditional ihop come here! And the prices are way better'"}
{"text":"I might be biased, but I love this place and recommend it as often as possible. The staff are very friendly despite being super busy almost all the time. The food is out of this world delicious and I promise you will leave full. 
My favorite go tos include the Bananas Foster Pancakes and omlettes. But don't stop there, everything is great. They even do limited time pancakes!

The only thing to keep in mind is that if you are waiting for any members of your party they won't seat you until they get there. It's that busy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Note: Your entire party needs to be present to be seated! 

Now let's talk about the food! So freaking good. Anything you could want from breakfast they've got it. Did I mention they have Hawaiian breakfasts? Basically this is what heaven tastes like to me. 
If you haven't gotten the chance to try this place out, it's a Vegas staple."}
{"text":"Well, my family and I went here at a very packed time but we really wanted to try it out. Once we entered we weren't greeted, which is pretty bad especially if you're from Hawaii. If you've been there, the inside has a bit of a Hawaii-Aloha theme going but there was no \"Aloha.\"

Our waitress was very nice though. I would have to say she was the reason that made our experience there just \"okay.\"  We had to wait almost an hour for our food and sadly our waitress didn't keep up with refills; once our food was out we ate but it wasn't much of any enjoyment. The food lacked seasoning and the pancakes tasted really bad! 

Sadly, I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Babystacks is a great choice for both breakfast and lunch. We saw it on Yelp, and found the reviews accurate. A friendly staff who knows how to serve promptly. It is the excellent food that brought us back three times in our week's stay in Las Vegas. One breakfast...Banana Fosters pancakes...yummy...perfectly prepared and presented. Even their grilled cheese sandwich surpasses others, with crispy lettuce and turkey bacon...more yummy. Choices are many, and good coffee too!"}
{"text":"We stopped by  because it was close and sounded good. It was so excellent! He had the adobo omelet. It was so flavorful! I had hazelnut pancakes. The short stack just the  right size. Service was friendly. I was surprised at the line but they kept it moving. When we travel through Henderson, we'll stop here again!"}
{"text":"As everyone before has stated the red velvet pancakes were soooo great! The breakfast itself was just average. Sooo if you come, I would definitely have a speciality pancake. Great service! Jacob was awesome! FYI the place is called babycakes..."}
{"text":"Yummy.  My daughter, who is 20, loves this place. We frequent multiple locations.  The quality of food is consistent and good. They don't provide a lot of seating so you will see and smell what the table next to you is eating and how they eat it. The tables are close. The service has always been good. My daughter's favorite is the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast food especially for a hangover at vegas. Portuguese sausage with eggs and garlic fried rice is my fav. You have to get garlic fried rice. Took a star off cause they didnt give bigger portions. Banana cream pie pancakes were good but you kinda get sick of the banana flavor. Next time ill try the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"My third time here and I'm trying to like this place as it is convenient, but I just don't. The service is slow, the food potions are small, yet you pay a premium price. Their menu suggests a gourmet breakfast experience with all the pancake options, but the reality of my experiences is the equivalent of a $2.99 breakfast special with a wait and a premium price. 

Every time, the food is brought out piece meal, so not everyone gets their food at the same time. The eggs are always cold. 

Everyone that works here is super friendly, but there are so many other options where the portions are good and the service is prompt that they can earn my business. It's breakfast, not rocket science. As much as I wish I liked it, baby stacks just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a wait. Pancakes & Nutella crepes are delicious & so was the Hawaiian Benedict. We are taking bites from each other's plates."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and a great lunch menu too. Only downside here is that the venue is small and can get crowded. Expect a wait on weekends of about twenty minutes"}
{"text":"I have tried their red velvet, smores, white chocolate with macadamia, and chocolate chip pancakes. All of them are delicious but the white chocolate with macadamia. Although it is good, it doesn't have enough macadamia because both my parents ate them thinking it was just regular buttermilk pancakes. They couldn't taste the difference and even dipped them in syrup. The other pancake orders were sweet enough so we didn't need any syrup."}
{"text":"This place has amazing service and food. While it may take a while to get your food out to you when they're busy, the waiters and waitresses always chat with you to make the time go by faster. They genuinely care about you as the customer which is greatly lacking in many establishments today. I ordered and shared three stacks of pancakes with a friend. We tried the red velvet, cinnamon roll/Cinnabon, and white chocolate macadamia nut. Out of the three, my favorite was the cinnamon roll. On other occasions, I've had the loco moco and the portion sizes were generous. The eggs Benedict was delicious for something that normally doesn't suit my palette. Their hazelnut crepe was very yummy and it was nice that you didn't have to order it in a group of three like normal restaurants. The hot cocoa is to die for and certainly is the best I've ever had. I will be coming back to sample more of the menu soon."}
{"text":"I just paid $18 for scrambled eggs and rotten orange juice.. I wish i didn't do takeout.. but it's too late now. At least the employees were really nice. Oh well."}
{"text":"Came here for the red velvet pancakes. My niece found a long strand of hair in her omelet, nasty. Came once before it was ok, this time it was sub-par. Never again."}
{"text":"Have heard about this place but never tried it until yesterday. Very small cafe type but that's what I liked about it. Has a family owned at home feel to it. Menu has great selection. Was not in the mood for breakfast so had a sandwich it was still very good. I do want to come back and try the breakfast out. Service was friendly and quick. Will be back"}
{"text":"The menu is amazing! Peanut butter pancakes and garlic rice are my go to whenever I visit.. staff is always friendly.. 

My only grievance is that the tables are a bit small for the amount of condiments and portions served.."}
{"text":"Adobo Rice + Red Velvet Pancakes.
Enough said.
It's worth the extra money to upgrade.

If there is a wait, it will go by pretty quickly.
So good!

I want more!"}
{"text":"Stacks on stacks on stacks!

I used to love coming here! I was first introduced to a Babystacks cafe (a.k.a Babycakes) by a friend but we used to go to the one over in summerlin. Once we moved, this one became our favorite.

This place, like every other location is always busy! Which isn't a problem, just be prepared to wait about 30-45min depending on how big your party is, especially on the weekends. 

Ever since this place started expanding and opening up more locations, the service went downhill. The food is still pretty good depending on what you order. My favorite of course are the red velvet pancakes. They are soooo worth the long wait. They have a variety of pancakes you can choose from. But they also have everything else; omelettes, crepes, French toast, burritos to name a few.

I've tried quite a few different dishes, they used to do so much better. The food used to taste delicious and the prices were reasonable. But it's been a few visits where the food had to be returned. For the most part I stick to just ordering their pancakes.

I was so excited to bring my mother for breakfast, she had never been and I had hyped it up. But it was such a disappointment. The steak was so tuff the fork wouldn't even go in. Her whole meal was a disaster. We waited almost an hr to be seated and almost another hour after ordering. So by the second time they messed it up my mother had lost her appetite, and the waitress at the moment was so rude a decided to get an attitude and argue! Smh..

The service can be a hit or miss, but for the most part it's a miss. It's never consistent.

On a different occasion we showed up around 1230-1pm, after being seated and placing our order I started to get a strong smell of ammonia. They had already closed off one section of the restaurant, which to me was weird since they were still opened for two more hours. 

Once our food arrived, the smell of ammonia was so strong that I could practically taste it as I was eating. They had actually started moping in the area where we were siting as well as other customers and left the bucket sitting there without them using it. They had already mopped the area that was closed off so that's where the smell was coming from in the beginning. So I nicely asked my waitress if they could please at least wait till we left, but I was ignored cuz they kept on going. 

If it wasn't because of their red velvet pancakes, I wouldn't come back.."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast spot! The Huntington Skillet with a short stack of German Chocolate Pancakes hits the spot every time! I crave food here and eat it about once a week!"}
{"text":"Clean cozy breakfast spot. Staff are friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, the food is mediocre at best and this is the worst cup of coffee I've ever had. The scrambled eggs tasted like they came from a cafeteria, not made to order."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes are great!  Didn't like the hash Brown that much. Too dry and the bacon want my fave too. . They way they cooked it... too dry."}
{"text":"Filipino/Hawaiian/American-inspired breakfast cafe near Summerlin.

Damn, why couldn't this place have been here when we lived in the area?

Killer tried out the Chicken Adobo fried rice - I wasn't expecting it be wrapped in a scrambled egg, that was a nice touch and turned it into a full-blown Filipino breakfast in one shot.  Nice.

I went with the Kalua Pork Benedict and it was surprisingly good.  Kalua pork is usually super salty, but B-Stacks' wasn't.  not bad at all. 

Service was very friendly and attentive and you can tell this place is a local favorite by how packed it was so early in the morning.  

Def going to need a re-visit the next time I get my arm twisted to go to Sin City"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.. Customer service was great.. Seen the reviews and had to try the adobo omelette it was great.. They give you a choice for either hash browns or pancakes.. Also you can upgrade your pancakes to a specialty pancake which I did.. The waitress recommended the special of the day.. The Banana Foster.. It was good but a little too sweet for me! But I'm sure folks with a sweet tooth will love it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places. The location on smoke ranch and buffalo always have the best service. The food is amazing except for their macaroni salad. Other than that, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible customer service.  Came in with a large party and was sat on separate sides of the restaurant. Within 5 minutes of getting seated, another table opened up that was closer and they refused to let us move."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place.
I had the steak and eggs, because... well, Las Vegas.
The eggs were very nicely cooked. The pancakes were tasty."}
{"text":"If my husband didn't love me as much as he does, he would leave me for this place!!  LOL.  He fell head over heals in love with the food!  He sampled a bit of everything and didn't find one thing he didn't love.  He is Hawaiian and the menu was very island 'ish!  Portuguese sausage and Kalua Pig all over the menu!  Pork Lovers Delight!  He LOVED the Portuguese Sliders, actually said they were the best breakfast item he's ever eaten!  My \"build your own\" omelet was okay, a little think with the eggs and I didn't love the chicken.  I'm not a pork eater so my meat selection was slim.  The Red Velvet pancakes were delicious but one and a half was enough for me because they are SO sweet!  Jamie was a great server!  I will be back and my husband is trying to figure out what time he has to leave for work so he has time to drive across town to get breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfas. The ambiance is very friendly and family oriented. I also recommended  my brother in law who was visiting to eat there since he didn't want to eat on the strip cause of the prices. So after him and his family ate there I received a text of thanks from him. Food was great."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  Omelets are big and so are the burger and fries.bottomless coffee and soda."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Is one of the few ways to describe this place. Let's start with the fact that I'm no morning person whatsoever. I work swing sleep all day play all night. It's Vegas you get the idea. The reason I start here is because, this place was so outstanding I woke up early three times in the first week of trying just to have breakfast here. I wake for no one and nothing. Another thing the menu sounds so appetizing I would eat basically anything on it. Why is this also important? Because I'm one of the most extreme picky eaters known to man. Was not afraid to try something new everyday either. Which is just crazy for me. On the way in make sure to read the specials white board so you don't miss out on great seasonal items aswell. I almost passed up pumpkin pancakes. Yes they're different then friggin ihop's or denny's don't know how to describe how though, that's where you find out for yourself. Not to mention great service the wait for food felt like no time. House potatoes pretty typical but they have just the right amount of seasoning then add a side of red salsa...Exquisite! Small location on West Buffalo but worth any trouble anytime. Honestly Love this breakfast joint, life long customer added here, can't wait to keep trying new stuff!!! FYI the famous Red Velvet pancakes really are that unique and amazing, but like I said there's so much more to explore, and they make ordering in different fashions and combinations easy. Definitely give this place at least 2-3 tries lol even though it'll only take one. So much more to go on about but let's be honest, no point waisting time on reading this hurry in and eat up!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat a delicious breakfast! I had the breakfast burrito , and a side of garlic onion fried rice, I cant complain it definitely made my morning. :) great service also. This is officially my new spot!"}
{"text":"I was an instant fan of this place when they first opened. I love the various pancake selection and that the pancakes themselves are good and comparable to what I would make at home. The coffee has always let me down, but service has never disappointed me since the day they opened. 

The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of consistency with the pancake batter. Like I said, I've been eating here since they opened. I notice when they change the batter. Most times I get the perfect melt in your mouth pancakes. There was a period I was less frequent because they pancakes were too stiff. I understand they probably play with the recipe to make sure they produce pancakes that hold up under the various topping choices, but I hate stiff and rubber like pancakes. My last visit the pancakes found their way back to their original glory. 

Favortie pancakes:

carrot cake
banana fosters
peanut butter and banana

Luckily large portions does not equal good food to me. If that's your criteria for a \"good' meal then you should go somewhere else. I'm a fan of them not giving me more food than I can or should eat, and I will always comeback for the pancakes."}
{"text":"I LOVE PANCAKES!  And if YOU LOVE PANCAKES, this place is a MUST!

What makes this place even better is their Asian inspired breakfast items...makes the whole family happy!  We loved this place so much we came here twice during our one week vacation here in Vegas. 

On both of our visits the place was crowded, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Service was friendly and fast. From the time we placed our order to the time we got our food, probably was only about 10 minutes. 

Everything we ordered was soo good! The spam scramble w/garlic fried rice, cookies and cream pancakes, adobo fried rice, bananas foster pancakes, kalua pork grilled cheese and spam and eggs were all equally delicious!  Whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. 

Just to highlight on a few:
1) The garlic fried rice is quite tasty!  Just like how my mom used to make it. Lots of garlic flavor, just enough salt and even some bits of the rice is crunchy. I like my rice like that, brings back childhood memories. 

2) The Kalua pork grilled cheese was delish! The pork was smoky and had the perfect amount of saltiness to it. The Muenster and cheddar cheese made this grilled cheese oozing with cheesy goodness. 

3) Bananas foster pancakes - saving the best for last! My mouth is salivating as I'm writing about these pancakes!  The pancake alone is fluffy and has great flavor. The brown sugar butter combo serves as the syrup in this dish, thank goodness. It has the right amount of sweetness and the bananas was caramelized perfectly. 

I could keep going on, but you must try this place out for yourselves!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place. Their red velvet pancakes are amazing! I can't believe some people don't like them. I also love their seasoned potatoes. Everyone always complains about the wait time. Expect to wait on the weekends unless you go right at 7 which is what  I ALWAYS do. I always go early , like right at 7 and never have a problem. It is over priced but I'm willing to pay for it just because the pancakes are so good. I don't even live in Las Vegas but when I come I always go to baby stacks."}
{"text":"Went here the other day around lunch time. It's very small inside so if it's busy you could be waiting awhile. I enjoyed the huntington skillet breakfast. Hubby got the club and although it was good he felt they missed some items that usually come on it like cheese and mayo..... maybe add more than 4 tiny pieces of bacon too. Daughter got the bacon pancakes and she thought they were good. Everything was good but portions are VERY small for what you pay."}
{"text":"Rating would've been and 3 but they don't take Amex so that drops them down a full star in my reviews.  Wake up people it's 2017 you need to accept Amex!  This location wasn't half as good as their location in Summerlin.  Service was good.  My pancakes didn't come with enough syrup and were kinda dry.  Real skimpy with the coconut as well on my German Choco pancakes"}
{"text":"Loved the German Chocolate Pancakes!  Light, fluffy and flavorful.  It was like eating German Chocolate Pancakes for breakfast.  Would love to try a sample of all of the different flavors.  My better half got lemon Ricotta Pancakes and loved them as well.  Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is really great, a true local delight! The space isn't very big, so expect to wait for a table around peak brunch/lunch time. I can't speak for weekends, but it was pretty busy on Monday at around 12:30-1 PM. They clear fast, though, so it's worth the small wait. The customer service is splendid! I ordered a Loco Moco (which is really delicious) and the eggs weren't cooked right, so they very courteously remade it for me. :D I also ordered German Chocolate pancakes, which has a carmel-y coconut glaze with pecan pieces. The food is a bit indulgent, so if you really want to try the signature dishes, go on cheat day.
The interior is homey and very cute, and the environment is very much \"breakfast-place\". The price is all right, definitely a better alternative to IHOP, if you're looking for a ballpark price range."}
{"text":"So disappointed.....

I think our negative dining experience had more to do with this location's poor management more than anything else.  It's obviously a busy location, but the process for checking in, waiting, being seated, waiting and then waiting even more....was too much.

The icing on the cake....when someone finally asked how things were....as we are paying on the way out.....when we said it wasn't good and for our first time here we were disappointed....the guy taking our money said nothing!  Not even a sorry about that, yeah today was really busy but give us another try, or even let me see if my managers available???  Nothing....

My Yelp recommendation DON'T try this location!"}
{"text":"I love Babystacks. I've only had one dish here, the Banana Foster, but It was amazing I loved it so much. I hope this location gets more money invested into it because it has major potential. The only problem with this place is that it needs a better seating arrangement especially for those big crowds, but altogether the food makes this place."}
{"text":"Love it!!! A delightful little restaurant! I've been only a handful of times and so far I've enjoyed every single bite! I'm so glad they came to Henderson!"}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast food. Simply delicious. Babystacks is further from the Las Vegas strip but worth the Uber ride. I would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Me and my husbands favorite breakfast restaurant since we moved here! The staff are overwhelmingly nice and food gets out pretty fast! We always take food home because it's very filling for us! He loves the French toast and I love the many different varieties of pancakes!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Babystacks Cafe is most definitely a morning staple! Great food and good service is what you consistently find. The wide array of pancake flavors is great and every thing that we have tried has been delicious! My husbands favorite is the red velvet stack, I like the bananas foster. We have basically made our way around every skillet in the menu with the Huntington or the HM1 being our top choices. Keep in mind to arrive early and plan on waiting to get a table. Just know that it's well worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about Baby Stacks, and the food definitely met my expectations. Built my own skillet - delish! Unfortunately the service was extremely lacking. The server seemed like he didn't want to be there. He didn't check back after dropping off the food, and my toast didn't come out until after we had finished eating. Overall a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday. The food was excellent and the Portuguese sausage was awesome! Love the choices of pancakes. I highly recommend the Red velvet stack!
IHOP better step up their game!"}
{"text":"Very surprised to find this place. A Hawaiian local type food with a Filipino twist. The service was fast and friendly. The food was outstanding. Make sure to get some pancakes with your breakfast."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, you must try this place! Their red velvet pancakes are extremely good. When I ordered it, I had the two piece one where you can add to your dish. I got the khula pork benedict which had a really good holiday sauce on top. The service was really friendly.  I would definitely go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Upon entering the establishment, warm welcomes were given. Which was great! Speedy service and the wait time for the food was not long at all! 

They ensured my order was correct and if anything, would change it. 

I've dined here a couple of times and never have I had a bad experience. Food and beverage always up to standards.

Keep it up guys! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pancakes - the red velvet are a must try, although I liked the banana bread ones more.  The cream cheese syrup is a bit on the sweet side, but it paired perfectly with the flavor of the pancakes - regular maple would not be nearly as good.  

The Eggs Benedict was also very good, although the ham was a little on the tough side.

There can be a super long wait here and they aren't always accurate with their quote times.  We were quoted 20 min and ended up waiting 45 min for a table.  They had many tables clear of people, but the one busser couldn't keep up to get people seated quickly.  They could get a lot more business if their service was ran more efficiently.  

Nonetheless, I would return for the fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place has a ton of pancakes! I ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut short stack, to go with my huevos rancheros, and I have to say everything was delicious!! The service was great, the food was so filling and so delicious, and the restaurant itself was very cute, clean, and had a friendly atmosphere. There is no reason to ever go to an IHOP again with these around Vegas! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is good and had good flavor. 
The place itself was really small. 
Every time I've gone, there was always at least a 30 min wait.
Im sure they'd have more business if they relocated to a bigger space."}
{"text":"We decided to order pick up for Breakfast thru phone, gave them more time to prepare for it, when my husband was ready to pick up our order the cashier said that they never receive our order and keeps insisting that we order in a different location & because my husband keeps saying that we ordered in that location they got mad, so my husband said if they can pull out all the orders that they have in there system so my husband saw his number and the order was made in that location.1st of all before you say something to your customer  please double check all the orders!  They apologized because they said that they forgot our order, REALLY? after how many minutes of waiting. Worst Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I definitely was impressed. The banana creme pie cakes were amazing! The service was quick, entire staff was friendly. Only minor complaint is the tables are a little close together, making it feel as if the person next to you is in your conversation."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I got buttermilk pancakes, house potatoes, spam and eggs. The spam was waaaay over-fried and too crispy for me. The pancakes were good but dry. Make sure you have a lot of water when eating one. I usually say breakfast food is hard to mess up, but in their case, they somehow didn't get it quite right."}
{"text":"Flavored pancakes - what will they come up with next? 

I've ventured to the other side of town to take in the indulgences of Babystacks and was not disappointed with their \"new\" location on the Eastside. There was quite a wait (close to 30 mins) but it seemed far less. 

Red velvet pancakes and a skillet with potatoes, eggs, spinach and cheese were on my side and Orange Creamsicle and Rick's adobo fried rice were on the BFs."}
{"text":"Breakfast is a meal I never really eat, but when I do... 

The Red Velvet Pancakes with cream cheese frosting-syrup was mouth-watering-ly good and I'm glad we opted for the full stack instead of just a half stack. 

I always like to pair something savory with the sweet, so we got the Piglet omellette with seasoned potatoes. 

Grades
Pancakes -  A+; it was definitely worth the drive \"across town\"
Piglet - C-; I don't know what it was, but it wasn't out the ordinary
Seasoned potatoes - A; I can't pass on potatoes

We managed to beat the \"lunch rush\" because as soon as we were seated about 5 other parties showed up and there was a huge line. 

Also, beware of the small tables. The table next to us had their drink spilled on them due to lack of space. It was kinda funny and sad to see."}
{"text":"Breakfast great ! Loved the carrot cake pancakes and banana cream pie pancakes ! Also the Portuguese sausage !!!!! Local Moco ! Wow !"}
{"text":"I've been to the location at Buffalo but this one was by far more cleaner, modern, and less crowded. As far as food quality goes, it's pretty much the same.
They have a great selection of pancakes; from banana pancakes to chocolate mint!
They also have a lot of comfort/filling food. They have Loco mocos, breakfast foods such as eggs, spam, and rice.
I recommended getting the island favorite, which consist of rice, eggs, banana nut muffin, and porteguese sausage. For pancakes, I really like the red velvet and chocolate mint. The prices are around 10 dollars a plate, the pancakes comes in stack of 2 for 4 dollars each. They service is friendly and they take care of you.

Update: after being here a handful of times, I strongly suggest trying out their skillets, specially the Huntington skillet. Also for pancakes, give their German chocolate pancake a bite!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast here on way to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.  The arrangement of food is nicely place, suggesting care and pride.  The service was pleasant and attentive.  On this trip, the red velvet pancakes and the loco moco were the pleasure of the morning.  The red velvet pancakes, the Hawaiian style menu items and the reasonable prices will draw me again on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Babystacks is one of our favorite breakfast places! The eggs were perfect and the pancakes are soooo good! Blanca was our server today and was very friendly and always made sure our coffee was refilled. The only complaint I have is that the water is so gross. Its thick and tastes like it's unfiltered. Its undrinkable. Otherwise everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast choices, luv the sausage. Pancake choice amazing. Hard to decide what to eat, this place is well worth checking out."}
{"text":"The service and food was great.  We were a party of 5 and they gave ups updates often on the status of our table.  I had adobo fried rice omelet which was delicious.  Just the right amount of tangy to adobo.  Kids has red velvet regular stack that they shared.  It was way too much, definitely gonna get a short stack next time.  They also had Kalua pork grilled cheese and Portuguese Sausage sliders with fried and mac salad.  Kalua was great, not too salty which tends to happen sometimes.  Didn't realize the sliders was and omelet in buns.  But is was also really good.  And Mac salad was just like home (Hawai'i).  Husband had the Chili Moco which was also delicious but he said it should have had more chili.  

Service was great!  We were greeted and offered drinks as ion as we got to the table and they refilled water and coffee often.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is WAAAAY overhyped in Yelp. Went for breakfast with my finaceé a couple of weeks ago.

Kudos for the original dishes of this place, thou. With all the options around it is not easy to come up with a different breakfast menu. Its different than most places. BUT does it make it better?? My main complaints:

1-OJ is NOOOT fresh or natural. WTF!!? You would expect a decent juice madeout of fresh oranges. Especially with the high ratings in Yelp. Nah. 

2-Burned coffee. Yes, burned. 

3-Slow service. I waited around 30min for a table and when seated, other 10-15min only for the first plates to be served. 

4-My fianceé ordered the \"popeye crepe\" or something like that. The sauce (hollandaise?) was awful. Very greasy, salty, creamy and disgusting. I had the flavor in my mouth all day long. 


The only decent thing was the walnut pancake. 

Ill stay with Eggworks."}
{"text":"The food is amazing every time I go. Also the staff is very friendly. If I could, I would come everyday for breakfast. Best pancakes around."}
{"text":"Be ready for a long wait...
But great food!

The food was sooo good we over ordered & definitely coming back to try other styles of pancakes!!! The pancakes are endless of great flavors"}
{"text":"Ok I can honestly give this place a 5!! The line wasn't that bad umm 30 mins on a Saturday not bad at all. But we had to slip our bills. They don't do separate checks.  But the food was on point .. No complaints At all. The seasons potatoes was off the hook. The sausage was good too! My banana cream pie was different I give that a 5 Star!! I will be back I promise you that lol I even order to go lol.."}
{"text":"This place is super close to my house and has become my go to for brunch on the weekends. The food is delicious and the service isn't bad at all!"}
{"text":"I waited for about 10 minutes out in the parking lot for this place to open. Given the praise this place has received and how busy it gets, I didn't mind having to wait just to be the first customer. 

Once I was let inside I didn't have to look at the menu because I already knew what I was ordering; red velvet pancakes. This was my first visit and I was blown away by how incredibly good the pancakes are! they are by far the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The cream cheese syrup and the whipped cream topping with little chocolate chips is simply an amazing combination! I will definitely return here, it's too good to miss out on."}
{"text":"I would give them five stars, if the wait time wasn't so long and if they had better waiters.  But their red velvet and banana nutella pancakes are all worth the wait and patience.  They have the fluffiest pancakes ever!  I love these pancakes.  BUt be prepared for not so great service and a long wait line."}
{"text":"Love love love Babystacks!Always go when I have a chance. They have good there that would satisfy almost any kind of taste. I just wish they were open longer than 2pm. They do start early but sometimes your in the mood for that food later. Especially after being out all night and sleeping most of your day!"}
{"text":"Tried this place over the weekend and thought it was pretty okay. The kalua pig benefict wasn't bad. I think the red velvet pancakes tasted like cake and it was too sweet, but it wasn't bad either.  The banana foster pancakes were yummy, but I probably would ask for the syrup on the side since it was too sweet. However, I would definitely give this another try since there are other items on the menu I would like to try like the blueberry pancakes and spinach benedict. :)"}
{"text":"Babystacks is a good breakfast place. Expect to wait if you go on a weekend and possible parking issues. They are known for their dessert style pancakes and it's worth a try if you enjoy a more sweet breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice menu selection. Looked clean and well kept. Food was ok, not very hot when served. Will go again though, give them another chance"}
{"text":"Babystacks is a great breakfast place with awesome pancake options and island influence. The service is good, the portions are filling, and the price is just right.

I recommend the Two-Egg Breakfast. It's great for the indecisive diner, who has trouble choosing between a sweet or savory breakfast. And for only $6.25, you can get both in the form of two eggs cooked any style, potatoes or rice, and a small stack of pancakes or toast. And as president of the hypothetical potato fan club, I'm definitely an advocate on behalf of these potatoes. These potatoes are well-seasoned, slightly crispy, but remain wonderfully fluffy in the center. And even though rice is life, that's my shit. 

As for pancake recommendations, I definitely recommend the strawberry pancakes. While the other pancakes are delicious, I find them overwhelmingly sweet and tap out after a few bites. But I NEVER get sick of the strawberry pancakes. Not only are they a classic flavor combination, the syrup tastes fresh and feels like the perfect counterweight to the pancakes.

Overall, Babystacks is definitely one of my favorite breakfast diner options!"}
{"text":"It was 4th of July, wait was about 30mins at 10:30am, definitely Cafe space since we were elbow to elbow in the inside wait area.  Smiles were abundant during our visit and service was great though!  We gave the Portuguese sausage and Corned beef hash meals w/eggs over med a try - with an upgraded order of garlic rice in lieu of potatoes.  We also upgraded to Red Velvet pancakes and Lemon Ricotta crepes in lieu of the buttermilk/toast that is included in the Breakfast Favs on the menu.  We came back 3 more times during our 1week stay in Vegas - we just wanted to try the other menu goodies and we loved all of it!"}
{"text":"Usually I eat here however today I left without being seated. I normally don't have any issues with sitting at the counter but today the counter was FULL of guys and they were all together all dressed the same etc. There was a couple and a baby waiting for a table and the old lady at the counter kept trying to get me to sit at the counter and I told her I wasn't down for that. It seemed like I annoyed her and she's like well there's going to be a 20 minute wait so I sat down. It was busy but not that full, so after I sat a couple came in and signed in for a table and not even a minute later they were seated ? I was like WTF?! The old lady sat them right away, I should have been seated as I was there first. The AC was cranked up really high too, I understand that the wait staff gets warm but it's way too cold in there. I love the food here but it always does a number on my stomach. I ran over to Rachel's Kitchen I wasn't in the mood to deal with temperature and the hostess"}
{"text":"For some reason, the food isn't as amazing as it is on the west side, but hey... I love the location. I got the banana cream pie pancakes and my boyfriend got the loco moco. Something we always get at the other babystacks location (on south durango). My pancakes had some little tiny green stuff in the batter that I don't recall ever seeing before...but I ate it anyway... The whip cream isn't as fluffy or good. It was melting. The other location's whipped cream always came out thick and fluffy and didn't melt the way it did at Stephanie's location. Maybe it just wasn't good that day, I don't know. But sucks because I always get extra whipped cream. The loco moco patty was kind of hard (too well done). The other location's is softer and more like a medium rare. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, but they would need to contain quality control. It should taste the same as if it did at the other locations. 

I had a good breakfast with my boyfriend. It wasn't busy because it was at 9am but I know they get super busy as 10-11am hit. Our waitress was really nice and the place was super clean. So that's a plus. Good service. Just not up to par as the original location that I fell in love with."}
{"text":"Come early because there's no wait! Wait times usually get ridiculously high during 10-11am. If you know baby stacks they always always get super busy! Especially weekends and Sundays!!! Something to expect from an amazing breakfast/lunch restaurant!

I love their pancakes with extra fluffy whipped cream. I've tried the red velvet, banana cream pie, hazelnut, and regular pancakes. I also enjoy their seasoned potatoes! I always get them when I go there. The loco moco is delicious as well as the adobo fried rice stuffed in an omelet. SOO GOOD. Their skillets are also pretty good. I tried my boyfriend's one time. It was a little spicy because of his tabasco sauce but obviously that is something that can be controlled.

Babystacks is always a great place to have breakfast or lunch!
I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's not all that. First off the wait time is pretty long. Even during the week. They won't seat you until all your party is present. The restaurant is really small and seating is tight. The tables are very close together. The prices are high for mediocre breakfast food. The pancakes are small in size! The best thing about this place is the hazelnut pancakes with nutella. I must admit that it was very tasty! They do offer a military discount. However the old lady cashier is not friendly at all. Not sure if she's the owner."}
{"text":"Well, I found a new breakfast place! Ok, I didn't personally find it but our friends recommended meeting there for breakfast today and I am so happy they did. 

Babystacks recently opened their Henderson location on Stephanie. Our waitress was great, very friendly and good service. We were served coffee within a minute or two of sitting down. The food did take a while to come out after ordering but we weren't in a hurry and it was definitely worth the wait (and the calories!) 

I ordered their specialty, a full stack (6) of red velvet pancakes. They were served with whipped cream and a cream cheese \"syrup\" which was more of an icing. They were delicious! The short stack would have been fine but you only live once. We will definitely be back to try some egg dishes or nutella crepes."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that the basics (like on and syrup) were procured from a vendor versus being locally acquired (e.g. fresh squeezed on and actual maple syrup).
The menu items suggest a Hawaiian influence, and I would recommend that you stick to those items.

The flavor of the burrito was insipid. The poached eggs were soggy (they brought them in a bowl that was filled with either water or uncooked eggs), the fruit bowl had very little to it (5 grapes, where 2 were rotten, 2 overripe strawberries, 1 cube of melon), and everything was soaked in butter.

The  best bet is the pancakes (the title character in their menu) and the Portuguese sausage.

I also noticed that the decor near us was covered in dust curtains. This makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen.

The server was very nice and accommodating. The food came promptly.

Overall, this place is trying to be too many things ( pancake house, Mexican breakfast, Hawaiian food, breakfast basics). They should just stick to pancakes and spend the money they spend on spoiled fruit on real maple syrup and fresh squeezed juices.

I give them one star for the staff. The second star is for the wait time for food."}
{"text":"Seriously? All these great ratings? I was so excited to go and was quite disappointed in a few ways...
We waited an hour for a table, yes the place is small, but when I see emply tables and servers staff around talking, you have to agree that the wait is not warranted.
The flavors of the pancakes are quite interesting and we liked the ideas when reading the menu, but the pancakes were a little thin, dry and tough - I think a fluffy pancake is worth talking about. I will admit the cream cheese syrup was totally tasty!
Call yourself BabyCakes and the Cakes should be amazing.
We wouldn't go again, I can make better pancakes at home."}
{"text":"Can't even begin to tell you how amazing this place is! The staff always so warm and welcoming first off! And second the menu is full of great dishes! Havnt had one thing that wasn't great! The pancakes here oh my god I gotta tell you the best ever had in my life every flavor they offer so many different great ones  my favorite is the German chocolate cake ones you got to have it!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp before our drive back to Cali. Glad I found this spot. The wait was around 20 minutes, the service was great and the food was delicious! I ordered banana pancakes with chocolate chips inside, seasoned potatoes and coffee. Everything was so good! I would definitely reccomend this breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Island Fresh meets Vegas Request!

The surprise on my face when I opened the menu and saw some of my favorite dishes available: Portuguese Sausage and eggs and even Spam Eggs and Rice. With a side order of their delicious Red Velvet Pancakes and CreamCheese Syrup... The perfect start to my afternoon (considering I have yet to make it there before 1130am).

The environment is moving but not too busy with the constant Hawaiian Reggae tunes playing in the background. The staff is friendly and helpful and the location is conveniently located to not have to worry about parking. My only gripe would be the size of the location making for a sometimes unwanted wait time. Otherwise, great food for a good price!

Update: Had the cookie butter French toast... Amazing!"}
{"text":"oh my word, can you say RED VELVET PANCAKES!! Dee-licious!!
I had the toppings on the side b/c I read previous reviews it was too much, good thing b/c it would have been a hot mess!
Anyhow, good coffee, awesome fresh eggs, and again RED VELVET PANCAKES!!
Highly Recommend it!"}
{"text":"The red velvet was delicious, it was light and didn't make you feel disgusted after wards. My daughter had a kids chicken quesadilla with a side of fries, I had a bite, they were just okay. I had a loco moco, the menu said \"generous portions\", but it wasn't generous. Ive been to other places where their loco moco was humangous
 The loco mock was \"just okay\". I rather eat at Egg works or Hash hash a go go
Service was good. The waiter made sure our cups were filled w our coffee.
The place was clean, my party didn't wait long. We came early to beat the crowd. It started getting packed after 10am.

1 star for the pancakes
1 star for cleanilness
1 star for the waiter being right on time
3 stars!"}
{"text":"Stack em up stack em stack em up!!!!
As a lover of all things breakfast, baby stacks has definitely been a consistent force when I get my breakfast on. Why?? Because they know their skills and they play to it. It's vibe is small and charming, the staff is super nice and helpful and I've never not seen a crowd inside. It's also right next door to a bar, which means I have had to use them to soak up the previous nights questionable decisions. However eating here has always been a good decision. They have lunch foods like Kahlua pig and adobo fried rice but I stick to breakfast. I usually opt for the Piglet, which is several forms of pork in An omelette  or the Denver omelette, which is a The same everywhere else. All omelette can be had in skillet form, which is nice. The real star though are the pancakes. It's called baby stacks for a reason, so sitting down and stuffing your face full of pancakes is what you need to do. They have about 15 types and I haven't tried them all yet. The crown jewel is of course their red velvet, which is only my 4th favorite. I absolutely go bonkers for the white chocolate  macadamia or the German chocolate. Orange creamsicle is also a bit weird but good. The only two I can say I didn't like we're the honey wheat and PB&J. As much as I love PBJ, it just doesn't work on pancakes. However you're not stuck with that because you can do peanut butter and banana or peanut butter and Nutella
My only gripes about this place is that their bacon game could step up. It's fine for an omelette but on its own, I expect more
I'm not going to complain about the wait because not only is it usually less than what they say, I take it as a sign they're doing something right 
TL;DR come in, eat some pancakes. Tip your waitress, walk out like a boss"}
{"text":"There are a lot of Hawaiian and Asian themed breakfast items.  The savory breakfast items are ok.  Most people seem to come for the pancakes which are diabetes inducingly good.

If you are going to splurge get the Red Velvet or Cookies and Cream.  

Only three stars because they are just pancakes and the other items are average."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this restaurant. Island music is playing in the background the food is fantastic! The portions are great and even the plain butter milk pancakes are delicious. They are so fluffy! The service is friendly and fast. I will definitely be a repeat customer. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Las Vegas. Their pancakes are absolutely amazing. Been here many times over the last couple of years and tried many of their offerings. The orange creamsicle and banana foster are my favorite but nothing has ever been bad. A must if you're a pancake lover."}
{"text":"Not worth it at all terrible food and over price you bettter of at Ihop won't be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Coming from out of town I had literally no expectations. One my friends suggested we try this place after they had heard about it on a previous trip to Vegas. 

Got to try a pretty good array of dishes because we were a group of four and very willing to share a bite of everything. 

The pancakes are obviously what people come in for, and they are phenomenal don't get me wrong -- but I actually really loved the zippy's chili skillet. Chili on breakfast seems so obvious, but for whatever reason I would have never thought to put it together -- it was hands down the best thing we ate there that day. 

I ordered the spam scramble, which was just meh, but I probably should've figured that since no other Yelpers really mentioned it at all. 

Lemon Ricotta Pancakes & Carrot Cake Pancakes were our babystacks of choice, and boy were they good! 

Get yourself off the strip and try this place -- it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Greeted and seated by a sweet local girl from Kaneohe, forgot to ask for her name, but she makes the place's vibe have that \"Aloha feel\"!! Then, the food part....

I ordered the Kalua Pork Benedict, German chocolate pancakes w coconut and pecans, & the red velvet pancakes! 

Everything stay tasting Ono as f@(?!... Especially having a sweet tooth, gotta tell ya, those pancakes are like crack!!!! 
It was a perfect dessert breakfast after breakfast lol...

Oh man, craving for that German chocolate pancakes again w that ooey goey coconut flakes right now!!! Wanted to try all them pancakes!!! I'm sure all of them are guaranteed to satisfy!!! Broke da mout!!! Mopped them all up!!"}
{"text":"I won't be writing a super excessive review about this place since everyone else below has already said everything good that needed to be said. However I will confirm that the red velvet pancakes and adobo fried rice is the bombdotcom! I will definitely drive from Henderson to this location again if I am ever craving those red velvet fluffy goodness or get my fili-food fix. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here once in awhile since highschool and I would like to say the food never disappoints! My friends and I stopped by since my car was getting serviced at the dealership. We got settled very quickly. The server, Austin was great. The best bang for your money is getting a custom skillet. You have the option to pick your kind of meat, vegetables, cheese, and how do you want your eggs. It already includes seasoned potatoes. Even though I didn't get exactly what I ordered, it still was good. Service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"So glad we a local take us here. Those red velvet pancakes were the business! Also had the Spinach and Mushroom Eggs Benedict--a great damn way to start off Vegas!

Great service, too!"}
{"text":"I drive by here a lot but I never really wanted to eat here. But, when my mom came to town she kept noticing the sign whenever we drove by. She thought the girl on the sign was cute and she also thought it looked like Heidi from the classic Japanese series: \"The Girl of the Alps\". So after seeing that, she really wanted to eat here. 

I really think that BabyStacks is one of those places that could be the next Starbucks... What I mean is that if they tried to franchise and expand, we could be seeing one of these BabyStacks locations in just about every shopping center.  They should try to expand to California or something..

I am a big fan of those Hawaiian-Filipino style pancakes. They are pretty hard to find on the mainland(outside Hawaii). So I was very happy to find out that they had one of these places only walking distance from where I live. I was not disappointed when I showed up. 

The country gravy here is the best I have ever had. It's not that canned stuff, they make there own gravy here with bacon, milk, and flour. The biscuits & gravy and the chicken fried steak are the best things they got here. 

The customer service is superb. They got very social and friendly workers here. 

The only problem I have with this place is that they don't open for dinner. I'd be here almost every night if they opened late.

Also want to address Kevin A's review of this place. His profile is here: http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=87TJFieNsGOTFGsaTDegwQ
If it isn't annoying enough that he runs around and gives every single local restaurant in the summerlin/north west area a 1-star rating, claiming they have \"bugs\" and \"insects\"... he gave this place one star because he didn't like that there were \"too many Asian's here\". And according to this profile  the dumbass is married to a mail order Filipino woman...what a loser! Get the F*ck out!  

5-Stars to BabyStacks. It's the best Filipino-American restaurant around. It's so good, I'd even recommend it to the King of the Philippines(aka Manny Pacquaio) if by some chance I ever met him."}
{"text":"Chris is the best server in town!!! Was in this place on sunday am had Portuguese sausage plate w red velvet pancakes-- i mean heaven!!! Ugh thank you for the awesome food n awesome service!! Til next tym"}
{"text":"Been here several times with the family. Red Velvet pancakes are the best! You usually have to wait 20-40 minutes, but it's worth the wait. I highly recommend eating here. It's clean and has friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, quickly seated. I got the baby chick skillet, it is an ideal comfort type food, it was good. I stayed full all day. If you love breakfast this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"I tried both the original place and this one, Got the Mexican Skillet, the pork was kind of dry but with all the extra salsa and sour cream it help it a bit.  I would come back though, it was good. It was my first time being here since I don't live in Vegas, but it reminds me of a breakfast joint in California."}
{"text":"First time here with hubby and it's one of the best breakfast we had. We ordered the adobo fried rice and the skillet chicken (it had spinach, potato, cheese, herbs) both dish was amazing! Recommended and the staff is so nice.."}
{"text":"There are two things here that are pretty much must-have's: the red velvet pancakes and the adobo rice.  Most reviews will give you plenty more to go off of.  Also, for breakfast, my bill always tends to run me about $20 more than I expect...but hey, its good."}
{"text":"Fast and great service.  My husband and I came here by the suggestion of our family in Vegas, I read the reviews and Yelp, and I was not disappointed.  
First of, it's a small, cozy venue.  Greeted really nicely.  Reasonably priced. 
We could not decide on the flavors of pancakes so we had 3 short stacks: banana cream pie, red velvet, and bacon pancakes. Plus we had a side order of the Portuguese sausage.  Everything was delicious.  My husband loves the red velvet.  It was not super sweet, just perfect favors. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I haven't been the biggest fan of Babystacks, so when my OG wanted to check this place out now that they've opened a location closer to him, I was reluctant, but always up a food expedition.

We arrived on Memorial Day and it was not busy. We were seated quickly and I decided to finally order the adobo omelet I've had my eye on for a while. The rice was flavorful, but just a little on the dry side. I would have probably preferred if it was just the rice and skipped the egg, but I enjoyed it. 

I also ordered the red, white and blue pancakes that were on special for the day. Topped with blueberries, strawberries and whipped cream, I wish I had gone with my first instinct and asked that they forego the white chocolate chips. The pancakes would've been better without them. The pancakes were good, but like the other locations, they are small and not very fluffy. They did taste good, however.

We had a good meal and I got to spend time with some of my favorite people, so that's a plus. It's a good addition to this location and I see them being successful here."}
{"text":"NOT a fan of the waiting. The hostess definitely unestimates the wait time. We were given a 20 minute estimate that ended up being nearly an hour. 

Definitely good food.  I think the food is on the right track, but the execution is lacking...  I was very reluctant to try the red velvet pancakes, since I thought they would be overly sweet, but they were delicious but could be more fluffy and and moist. Luckily the actual pancake wasn't too sweet so the whipped cream, chocolate chips and cream cheese sauce that topped it weren't too overpowering.  My omelette was cooked exactly as I requested and so were my potatoes.

Pleased with the experience overall. The waitstuff was friendly and efficient and the food came out in a timely fashion.

My only two major complaints were the long wait and less than welcoming hostess.  Those two things aside and this place might become a regular hangout for me if I can figure out when it's less busy, lol."}
{"text":"I debated between giving Baby Stacks a 3 or 4 star review. I give them extra credit for all the variety and the fact that it makes me want to try more.

I came here for breakfast this morning to redeem my Yelp Deal. I have been to their first location in the past and was excited that they opened another location closer to my home. 

We came in around 10am, and as I have experienced at the other location, the wait was pretty long. Unfortunately, as with the other location, they underestimate the wait time as well. I just like to know what I'm getting into before I decide to wait or not (don't worry, I'm done venting about that).

We were finally seated and the service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the ham and eggs with hash browns and upgraded to the lemon ricotta pancakes. My fella ordered the chicken omelet with homestyle fries and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes. The food was solid, although I was not a fan of the canned ham they served instead of ham steak. I was also a little disappointed that despite asking for my eggs and hash browns well done, the eggs were runny and the hash browns were really pale, not well done by any means. The food was still good though. I'm a big fan of the flavored pancakes, but the lemon ricotta really weren't doing a lot for me. I wish the curd were slightly more tangy and lemon-y, it was just a little too sweet. The red velvet were just right however. I also wish the pancakes had a fluffier consistency, but the flavors are still really nice.

Overall, a good dining experience and I'm still interested in trying more of their menu items."}
{"text":"I'm in from out of town, my friend who is local and had gone once before didn't have the greatest opinion. It took 45 minutes for our food to come out and I asked for a sprite later and it took 15 minutes for me to get that.  Service is bad, food was ok."}
{"text":"From sweet to savory it's all good.  Good coffee.  We had Loco Moco, red velvet, and cookies and cream pancakes.  Five star all the way.  Get here early as it gets packed."}
{"text":"i have been coming here and talking about this place since I first moved to the valley. For any Hawaii locals, this is your spot to go for local kine breakfasts and more! It is always busy and by always, I mean always. I have never been here where I didn't have to wait for more than 30 mins. Service definitely incorporates that aloha spirit. Food never disappoints from their red velvet pancakes, to their kalua pig eggs benedict and corn beef hash and eggs. My mouth is drooling just talking about it. Prices are overly reasonable. If you get a typical breakfast like their steak and eggs, you get a choice of pancakes or toast. PANCAKES!?!? as a side?!?! That's AMAZING! They have two locations on separate sides of town so you can stop by no matter where you're at. Mahalo and enjoy the grindz."}
{"text":"OMG.  That was amazing!  I got the Huntington Skillet, and added cilantro and sour cream.  It was such an amazing breakfast, that I can't wait to dig into the leftovers!  I got my skillet with a side of the red velvet pancakes, which were very good, as every one says.  BUT.  My son got the banana cream pancakes, which tasted exactly like taking a bite of a banana cream pie!  (Note I said a bite - that was all my son would let me have!)  I will definitely go there again,  but next time, I may do carryout - it was a 45 minute wait to eat in. Well worth it, but still... I live close enough that carryout might be a better option for me!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just gotta say \"damned that was good\". This is one of those times. Peanut butter pancakes and eggs.. and great service."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with this place. The food is always amazing and the service was very good. This definitely is my new favorite breakfast place. I've ordered different stuff every time and it's always very tasty ! No complaints. My favorites are the sweet cream crepes with strawberries and their skillets."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Chili Moco and my lemon pancakes.  What is great is it is so different than most breakfast places.  If you are in the mood for something unique this place is it.  Love the Gigantic water glasses, service was awesome and Filipino Friendly...I tried their house special breakfast which is Adobo Rice wrapped in egg...looks like a burrito made of egg....It had very good flavor.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"BabyStacks Cafe is the locale formerly known as Babycakes Cafe.  I am updating my review and adding another star because I am truly a fan of their pancakes.  In fact, I have yet to encounter a pancake that didn't make me swoon.  The non pancake dishes and even the coffee are whatevs, but the pancakes are reason enough for me to return again and again.  Carrot cake and Red Velvet are my favorites on their regular menu, but keep an eye out for their seasonal specials because THOSE are spectacular, particularly the pumpkin pancakes... yummo! 

I am glad I only live around the corner, because the wait times on the weekends are ridiculous.  I have done it once and learned my lesson. (Boy, was I grumpy!) Weekday brunch dates when my husband rolls into work after noon are wait free!  Stick to the pancakes and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing order small stack of blueberry pancakes found a few blueberries in pancakes  the pancakes were like rubber not fluffy at all had to cut them with a knife really? Sorry no return visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the potato skillet I had! It had spinach, garlic, and chicken. Quite possibly the best skillet I've ever had! Wish I could eat this once a week!"}
{"text":"Babystacks is our absolute favorite!!! Their red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting is amazing. They have 50 different types of pancakes but I always seem to stick with what I know."}
{"text":"I love babystacks! The red velvet pancakes were the best I have ever had! Looking forward to going back and trying the banana cream pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! Lots of pancake choices, but they also have a good selection of other breakfast items. All of the food was great, everyone opts for the red velvet pancakes and they are great but....I enjoyed the cinnabun pancakes better-try them! They literally melt in your mouth! Had no wait, but the place is small and most waited a few minutes. Well worth the wait if you have one. Definetely going back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  If you're in a rush then don't go.  It may be crowded as in many other reviews.  There is a reason for that.  As far as portion size goes it's more than fine.  The food is eclectic with an as close as you can get island style.  Those from the Aina understand this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for pancakes, this is the place to go! They have many different varieties, and offer Linguica and Spam as side meats, along with all the normal accroutments. We have been very pleased with the food, and service here. Our only complaint is, the last two times we have been there, my Wifes credit card info was stolen, and used at nearby stores, resulting in her having to go through the whole process of getting her card cancelled, long investigations of where the funds went, and having to deal with not having that money available to us for several weeks. (the first time the charges were in excess of 800 dollars, the second time it was over two hundred!) Great food, but you run a chance of having deal with stolen info."}
{"text":"I love babystacks!  Best breakfast in las vegas.  I love all the specialty pancakes they are like dessert   my favorite is the red velvet and cookies and cream too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the adobo fried rice omelet. I wish it had more if a trditonal adobo flavor as it was a bit on the light side for me. And the raspberry iced tea was kinda watered down.  But the cookie butter French toast was on point!"}
{"text":"The lines were so long. This place keeps busy. My friends and I waited for 40 min. I came here for the red velvet pancakes. I must say it was pretty good. Also enjoyed the other breakfast foods along with adobo fried rice. The portions were pretty big. BUT I gotta say.. I have tasted better adobo and can even make most of the stuff that we had ordered. Altogether I was pleased, but not too overly impressed therefore not giving this venue a perfect score. However, I do intend to come back and bring friends with me for the experience of red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Yum, yummy! My official new favorite breakfast place, the Baby Stacks on Smoke Ranch and Buffalo. We received a friendly greeting and were seated quickly. It was more like brunch time when we got there and it wasn't packed, but most of the tables were full. 
I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pancakes with hash browns and bacon. My daughter had the kalua pig eggs benedict. Delicious all around and the bacon was thick sliced and cooked perfectly. Only negative was the two eggs on the benedict didn't match, one was cooked hard, the other was properly runny.
It's a small, cozy restaurant. If you're looking for waiters in tuxedos, this isn't your spot. But if you want a homestyle breakfast served by friendly people with a tv up in the corner showing the game, try Baby Stacks."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast place when I'm in Vegas. Pork eggs Benedict and lemon ricotta pancakes are my sweet and savory picks. Worth every penny And everyone minute waiting. Wish there was something like this in irvine."}
{"text":"Babystacks is a great restaurant. The food was delicious. I enjoyed the pancakes and sausage. Very good quality. The staff was fantastic and very friendly. I would definitely come back again! It's is a jewel in the heart of Centennial Hills!"}
{"text":"Go to when in Vegas
Love the phillipino omelettes and red velvet stacks. I ate my body weight in food"}
{"text":"I don't think it's possible to hate BabyStacks. The breakfast is done well, they have tons of unique pancake concoctions, the price is reasonable and they do a military discount. The only downside is the size of the facility; it creates a bit of a wait if you're there on the weekend. In any event, it's WORTH the wait!"}
{"text":"Delicious Huevos Rancheros! The green salsa they used was amazing. Orange juice was fresh squeezed and tasty. Great Friendly service will be back for sure!"}
