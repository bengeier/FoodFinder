{"text":"Just finished two monster pancakes.  They were great, I understand pancakes are simple to make but when they are bad they are really bad. 

Service was good, our waitress came over often to top off drinks.  She even offered a to go cup. It was a nice touch. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"This friendly, neighborhood cafe has been convenient to us while visiting this area.  Certainly good enough to be a repeat customer, although it has been only for breakfast so far.  

Typical breakfast menu, with friendly and attentive service.  I like Belgian Waffles, and theirs is crispy and more than adequate.  Tasty bacon as a side.

Open for dinner only on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast.  Eggs Benedict & Corned beef hash were both good."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for Lunch and Breakfast!  Sorry,  no dinner. Very clean indoor and outdoor areas. Casual dress and relaxing atmosphere. Really good food. Tasty and nice size portions at reasonable prices. Very friendly staff and they have a bottle of Tabasco Brand hot sauce on every table!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service but it drives me nuts as to why it takes so long to be seated when there are 6 - 8 tables sitting open for over 20 minutes. We waited over 45 minutes the last time we were here and were eventually seated at one of the empty tables that had been been sitting there for 20 minutes. They need to fix this as it will drive people away."}
{"text":"One of best breakfast experiences in my life. I ordered the sunny skillet. You could taste the freshness of all the ingredients. Service was excellent as well. Our server even asked if we wanted to take our coffee to go. I thought that was an excellent touch. I highly recommend this place and will be back soon"}
{"text":"Great food! Loving the pumpkin pancakes! Chicken Telera Grill is another delicious option!!"}
{"text":"The food is usually good but the Service is dreadfully slow and even a bit clueless. Our most recent visit was a mid week morning and the waiting area was full while the dining room had many open tables, no one seemed to know who was next and a group were allowed cut the line.

I've said it before but I won't be going back as there are more options in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, and such a nice, clean, bright atmosphere!  We always see people we know here, people know a good thing when they see it!  Very willing to make any menu adjustments you have, and the coffee is always fresh and hot!  My \"usual\" is the veggie omlet made with egg whites and feta cheese, fruit cup and english muffin.  The fruit cup is always fresh and has a wide variety of fruit.  I always leave full and happy. Give it a try!  

The chicken salad sandwich is fantastic, as well.  Also goes great with a big cup of black coffee. :-)"}
{"text":"I used to eat here regularly, but over time their food just doesn't taste that good. Spaghetti is the worst. Breakfasts taste all the same. Service is hit or miss. If they're busy, U may never get a refill on your drink. Stay Away."}
{"text":"Everyone loves a down-home-style breakfast joint--especially when you're away from home!

The options, portion sizes and quality is a winning combo. I'm a breakfast lover, but more apt to order healthier options: dry toast, turkey sausage and egg whites. Because of this, it's not always easy to find a good restaurant that caters to a healthier diet, let alone one that has more exciting options like a Breakfast Quesadilla.  

Not only do they have healthy full meal options like the Protein Wrap (filled with egg whites, turkey sausage, spinach...etc. on a whole-wheat tortilla), but they have beautiful fresh fruit cups, yogurt with granola and flavored oatmeal. I'm pretty impressed. 

The wait was short and painless, even if it looked impossible in the lobby. They even offered coffee for the wait!

The prices are more than reasonable. The place is clean and cozy. And though I'm from out of town, next time I'm in Cleveland... I know where I'm going for breakfast!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Sunny Street because of the seasonal pumpkin spice pancakes. She raved about them, but I wasn't so sure since I'm not a raving pumpkin spice fan. Oh my gosh. They were SO good. An order is 3 HUGE pancakes served with cinnamon butter and syrup. I'm sad these are just seasonal because I'd order them all year. 
I also liked that they have a variety of flavored cream on the table. The coffee was good and we were offered more several times during our visit. 
The service was friendly and prompt. It was a Friday at 10am and the restaurant was about 75% full. They have a nice outdoor seating area as well."}
{"text":"Terrible. Waited for our breakfast 30 minutes.over heard the waitresses talking about customers walking out and or complaining. My Ouellette was feta cheese tomato. The omelets tasted like water from the mixture of the cold tomatoes
I couldn't find nor taste Festa cheese.the rye toast was cold."}
{"text":"The only thing great about this place is being able to eat out on the a patio for breakfast in summer.  Well one more thing the pumpkin waffles around Halloween !!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  It's like watching a ship sink.  The once mighty sunny street, falling like Rome.   At this time, there are 13 empty tables and a wait list.   The kitchen is backed up, we're told.  The name of the game is to turn tables and you don't do that by leaving half the restaurant empty.  On a wait list.  I am befuddled.  No busboy?

Customers were complaining loudly, the owner was at the register but did not make an effort to qwell the murmurs.

Customers are walking out.  At least sit them and give them coffee.  After seeing some of the recent reviews, it's apparent that the new owners appear to be very well intentioned, but clueless as to how to manage short order food.

Daughters pancake was blueberry, wanted plain.  Wife's BLT toast was burnt.  Server reached over us to remove dirty plates.  My eggs were fine, fruit was fresh.  Meh."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Great food, friendly staff, reasonable prices. If only sunny street was bigger ! On Sundays this place get PACKED to the brim because so many people love it! Hate to say that we have left a couple times because there wasn't anywhere to sit or even stand ! I would love if the owners expanded this place, or atleast the waiting area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I had met clients here a few times for coffee and a bagel and it was good. Today I took the family and everything was awesome. I had a Denver Omelette that was perfect. Best that I can remember having anywhere. Kids had pancakes and bacon. Both done to perfection. My wife had eggs and a fruit bowl that was fresh and delicious. The service was excellent as well. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the water wall and the beautiful morning. We will be going back soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"I used to eat here  quite a bit, but the last four times either the food or the service has been terrible. I hope they can get their act together because Concord needs good restaurants. maybe I'll try again if I hear the food or management has changed."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a better review, I really do, because the food was delicious. The careless, almost seemingly intentional terrible service really ruined what I had hoped to be a great breakfast on vacation with my mom. 

I got the Salmon Benedict with the fresh fruit and my mom got the Power Breakfast, also with fruit. The delivery of that was prompt, but it was like pulling teeth to get my mom's coffee filled, which was only refilled ONCE. 

The real kicker was the check debacle. We waited patiently for 15 minutes as we watched our waitress (Joanne) walk up and down the aisle, glancing at our check and card, but saying nothing. Finally, I broke down and asked her if we were supposed to take our check up front to pay, and she said yes. THAT would have been nice to know in all the time we were clearly waiting for you to give us directions.

Neither she or the manager seemed to care that out-of-towners weren't familiar with their procedures. Don't assume everyone will know what to do; maybe a little more direction, coffee, and pleasantry would have earned her a healthy tip."}
{"text":"Decent place for breakfast and lunch. I love that it's independent. It is very clean inside and has a nice patio. 

The staff are always very attentive to my coffee cup and the food is generally good. I was disappointed today to hear that the biscuits advertised as baked fresh daily are pillsbury. I have to say, it was evident at first bite and I couldn't even eat it. I was hoping for a scratch made biscuit. They do use quite a few convenience items, but the menu isn't bad and the pricing is good for what they offer. 

This is a nice place to stop for a welcoming breakfast or sandwich for lunch and for the caliber of place, the service ranks excellent"}
{"text":"The corned beef hash is a must try. Never had s bad meal here, more often than not I get breakfast food. The staff is always friendly and hustling. I actually really like having one tv on sports while having breakfast. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Found this place driving along interstate 90. Staff was very welcoming and we seated immediately. I ordered the hash and eggs and it was the best I've had in a long time. The breakfast quesadilla was outstanding. Corn black beans scrambled eggs and onion with pico de gallo and sour cream on spinach tortilla.  Great blend of tastes in both meals.   Dining space and bathrooms were clean. The best part other then the food was the attentive staff. They are exceptional."}
{"text":"When arriving although there were plenty of seats up front we were seated by ourselves around the corner by the bathrooms. This wouldn't have been a problem if we didn't have to wait over 20 minutes for someone to take our food order. We were about to walk out and leave since we were forgotten and finally our server arrives. She apologized and said she came back there and couldn't find us and we told her we've been waiting over 20 minutes and we've been here the whole time, she stuck with her story of not being able to find us. My boyfriends glass was not clean and felt nervous to ask for a new one due to the attitude of our server.  Finally she takes our food order and we get the food and it was OK. Was very disappointed and thought it was going to be better. Unfortunately I can't guarantee I will come back again."}
{"text":"Don't bother went on Sunday June 5th ordered breakfast took 55 minutes to get our food.  Half of our party had to leave without food due to lengthy wait.  People leaving left and right and then with half empty restaurant customers being told 40 minutes wait WHAT???  TERRIBLY RAN RESTAURANT and once we finally received our food it was not that great.  Manager did not apologize or try to explain issues one of the worst experiences ever at a restaurant will NOT be back."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS mom and pop kind of cafe! My boyfriend and I are currently on a road trip to Missouri and stopped by here in the morning for to-go breakfast; excellent service even when to-go! Linda was very kind and attentive and the pricing is great for the portion sizes! We got the sausage/biscuits&gravy and loaded hash browns, super satisfying be highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Always accommodating and quick service. Sunday mornings are super busy, so plan to wait (very small waiting area), but great overall experience for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Seems like a fairly new place, airy, clean and serves only breakfast and lunch. It reminded me of sitting at the cabin table and Grammy bring a nice country breakfast. Had the stuffed biscuit, full of sausage and other good things and covered in gravy. Just right for a country boy. Southern style grits were creamy and tasty, again taking me back to the old cabin porch for a hearty breakfast. Everyone was satisfied. Kids meal was a dinosaur pancake with sausage and went over very well. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a better score but I just can't. My family of 6 went out to eat. There was a party of 10 in front of us, other than that the restaurant was empty. 

We ordered our food and it took and hour and a half to get it. We didn't receive one refill on coffee or water the entire time. 

When we did get our food some was cold while others were just brunt to a crisp. Not one person at their meal. We left and had to get food somewhere else. Very disappointed!!!

The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of one is because the owner came by to apologize when we said we were not satisfied. That was nice but need to manage your staff better so the food can come out faster, and better tasting."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place for breakfast in Lake County. It is always busy but I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quickly. Their hash browns are the best and they always cook my bacon just right. The restaurant is cozy on the inside but it also has a beautiful outdoor patio where you can dine in the shade. I eat here at least once a month and have never had a bad experience. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't get why this place is so crowded. We waited, then three of us ordered breakfast and no one was satisfied with their meal. My sausage gravy had no flavor, and everyone else had similar complaints. It was bland and just didn't taste like anything. We now laugh when we drive by it and say to ourselves, \"no way\"."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. 

So this morning I decided to stop in and see what it's all about!

Was very pleasantly surprised by this little gem in my neighborhood. 

The service impeccable friendly and helpful, the food above standard.

I was very happy with the cleanliness the promptness and frankly everything about this place.

If you live in this neighborhood and have not been here....come, if you're driving by on I 90 and looking for a great little place for breakfast, stop.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have always had a great meal and service to match. Their veggie pita is delicious. You can't go wrong here for a casual lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place. You can tell it's well managed, and definitely has a good staff. The food is good enough, but, honestly, not great. Good coffee. I like the outdoor seating area."}
