{"text":"I was thirsty after having lunch so decided to explore the area a bit and look for a place that had smoothies. I went on Yelp and I saw that De Frantic Monkey bar was highly rated even though it had 6 reviews. I walked in and was greeted by a very nice lady (I later find out that she is the owner) and asked me if I was looking for the drink menu. I originally wanted a fruity smoothie, but I saw the Golden Monkey Chai and the Indian Chai and being the Chai lover I am, I opted for that instead. I didn't know what the difference was between the two so I asked the lady and she told me one was just normal black tea chai and the Golden Monkey was Chai Latte with Turmeric. I went with the Golden Monkey Chai as that sounded more interesting and it was a great choice! It was sweetened just the right amount and you could taste all the spices. I wished it was even spicier but will definitely go back for this again!"}
{"text":"A very strange place indeed. It appears as if you can order individual grinds and types of coffees, but the staff don't explain or clarify and are out of most types. I asked for a drink that could be made with any type of coffee and after a long wait was presented with a halfway decent cup of something that cost far too much."}
{"text":"Delicious chai tea latte and iced mango latte!! Came here after looking at some yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Not to mention, the owner is the sweetest & kindest woman - she takes pride in creating her own recipes and making sure the drinks are up to everyone's standards. I love supporting local businesses when I can :) seriously, try the chai tea latte."}
