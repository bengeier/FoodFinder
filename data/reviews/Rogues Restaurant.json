{"text":"We were greeted with lots of smiles and energy and genuine warmth which is a rarity these days I had duck sausage with mushrooms $15 which was very good.  Partner had Frutti di mare $17 which was also good. Entrees - Gnocchi, very average and for $23 so very overpriced.  Rack of lamb, spectacular and good value for $45.   Summary - Great place to go if you have money to burn but if you want value not so good.  Our waiter was nice but I always felt he was trying to rush everything from ordering to clearing dishes."}
{"text":"From the moment we were met at the door to our exit, we felt like long-time customers. It was very quiet when we arrived at 6 pm on a Thursday night but by the time we left about 2 hours later, it was pleasantly packed. The noise level naturally escalated but it didn't get too loud. Just a happy group of people. The clientele were mixed between men in business suits and older couples. We are mid/late thirties and we felt we were the youngest in the restaurant.  The kitchen puts a lot of thought into what goes into a meal and it's evident by the multitude of flavours and the pairing of ingredients. Everything was wonderfully match and not a single ingredient was over powering. I ordered a roast duck special and thought I might be hungry at the end of it but was pleasantly surprised at the generosity of the kitchen.   The burnt honey ice cream (home made) was a new flavour to us and exceptional.  This is very clearly our new favourite restaurant just five minutes from home."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant where you have no worries with any special order, the chef always accommodates. Open Monday's which is great for business meetings. Food is exceptional and service is top notch. Watch for fish fest in January, well worth it"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of an experience I would have in Little Italy in NY, except very homely and keen on customer service. We had the best waiter ever and Maitre'D. In fact There were other tables that wanted pictures with our waiter just as we did. As for the food, it is delicious and innovative having you say yum for every bite. Plates are well presented. We had the soup of the day, bruchetta which is made perfectly crispy on the outside and soft in the center but not soggy and the Venice sausage which was so delicious. We ordered risotto, swordfish pasta. Clam with pasta, calf livers. We were delighted by them all. It's also nice to see the array of fresh herbs that are used and chefs cooking in action. It's never too loud even though everyone is having conversations. The lighting and ambience are perfect for a date or family. It seems like everyone there is having a good time.  This is a place they call fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I took my friend for lunch to celebrate her birthday. I have gone to Rogues for 30 years. It was not thegreat restaurant I have experienced before.  The waiter was inattentive and did not even mention the many daily specials. My friend remarked that he was \"brisk\" with us. There were only diners at 2 other tables. Our lunch was a dreadful Caesar salad and a sickly sweet glass of wine that was supposedly Pinot Grigio. The bill for 2 for lunch was $81 before tip for 2 chicken Caesar salads 2 glasses of wine and 2 tea. Something was terribly off. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience and service.  Food was authentic italian food home made pasta.  We had the breaded scalopini which I ordered (customized) with angel hair in alfredo sauce.  It was exquisite! My boyfriend ordered the swordfish with pasta in rose sauce and also was great! We had several appetizers - capprese salad and grilled seafood all delicious.  The place is one of my top italian restaurants I have tried and I have tried a lot!! Also dessert was excellent!! We had tiramisu; and something with cream inside which was to die! Truly a special place to have real italian food; top of the line service and great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Mixed experience, Large bread basket with three different breads, though I am gluten free so couldn't enjoy. My dining partner said the bread was good and his veal was excellent but his side order of vegetables was average, mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and carrots that you could have gotten at any all you can eat cafeteria. My sausage and pasta was dried pepperoni style sausage, not the succulent chunks of sausage that I expected, though it was hot and spicy which I like. The gluten free pasta is corn pasta - OK but nothing special, tasted like what you can buy at any grocery store. Portions are small and I left hungry. Price for two entrees, one glass of wine and one soft drink with tip was over $75. Service started out great but was non existent once we got our food, which they brought out in 5 minutes, very quick as if they wanted to turn the table fast, and it was only a Thursday. They didn't come back to ask us if we wanted another drink ( we did) and they didn't offer water, we had to ask  at the end when they brought our check.  I would not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary dinner!  Great food and service.  The wife had the chicken and cooked to perfection.  My daughter had the pasta with salmon and she said best in Mississauga.  I had the lamb special.  Excellent despite being slightly overcooked.  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"We came late one Friday evening during the \"wild game\" special event. It took us a long time to even have a waiter to come and greet us at our table and this slow service continued for the evening.   We placed our order, both of us for the wild boar pasta, and it took a while for it to come out. When we did get our dishes, we went through the mushrooms, wondering which were the pieces of wild boar. I pointed this out to the waiter, Carlos, and he said he would be back. We kept eating, not knowing what was happening. Carlos finally came back, minimally apologetic, with pieces of wild boar for both of our dishes. At this point both my husband and I had consumed more than half of our pasta. At a decent restaurant, they would have re-prepared the dish.   When we finally got the bill, I was surprised that there was no consideration for the fact that our dishes were missing the main ingredient. A free dessert or a small discount would have appeased me. I pointed this out to Carlos and he wondered what the problem was considering we eventually got the wild boar. I told him that the reason we eat out is not for the ingredients but for the full experience and the service, and that if that was his idea of good service, I would happily pay the bill. He kind of rolled his eyes and said he would speak to the manager.   Everything was still not that bad, until Carlos came back with one of the pasta dishes removed from the bill, with the sarcastic comment \"I at least have to charge you for something,\" insinuating I had come for a free meal. I found this extremely disrespectful and it made me not want to visit the restaurant again."}
{"text":"we went to rogues for a \"date night\" and werent disappointed. reservations were needed as it was full and the level of noise was a bit higher than expected. the menu is italian multi course and had all the necessary items - risotto and lamb. the waiter was precise and well trained and went through the many daily specials without having to pull out a list. we ate only from the specials and they were served on time and he pasta was fresh and good. their wine list is large enough that you wont have a problem with pairing and it was decanted for us in a nice table appropriate bottle. espresso had good crema and the lemoncello was the right temperature. overall i would go back there but likely try a less busy/noisy night."}
{"text":"The food was \"ok\"   We started with Caesar salad, great Caesar salad, nice homemade dressing. That's one reason why they got 3 stars.   My friend had The Parmesan breaded veal scallopini and it was beyond tasteless. Was tender but no flavour whatsoever.   I had the rack of lamb, was ok, they put the mint Au juice on the plate instead on the side, and I found the sauce a bit salty. It came with scallop potatoes and all it is, is literally scallop potatoes roasted with no flavour. The side dishes of vegetables was \"blah\" just saut√©ed eggplant, onions and red peppers. Overall experience was \"ok\""}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants! I have been here 5 or 6 times and the food is consistently delicious. My stand out favourites are:  Rolled Eggplant \"Bocconcini, Parmesan & Pinot Grigio Tomato Basil Sauce\" This is an appetizer-sized eggplant Parmesan-like dish. The primary flavours are pronounced sweet and tangy from the tomato basil sauce. Balanced by with the salt and the texture from the cheese. I love it! I need this dish in a main course size!  Ricotta and Spinach Agnolotti \"Light Rose Sauce & Parmesan Gratin\" Delicate flavours but oh so delicious. Creamy, lightly sweet with fresh basil flavours. The pasta is always perfectly al dente.   Call ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"Then wine was the best part of our meal. I ordered the rack of lamb, my wife ordered the steak.  1) They got our grill preferences mixed up. 2) the food was average / below average. 3) desserts appeared bought from the grocery store.  At this price range I'd expect something fresh and unique. Overall a poor part of our Saturday night - not trying this place out again"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant among several fine dining options on the Zomato app and decided the great reviews meant it was a nice venue for a birthday.  Seating was prompt as we had made reservations two hours before.  I enjoyed my salmon while hubby thought his NY sirloin was just alright; elegantly presented but not outstanding as expected.  They added a sweet touch by tossing in a surprise mini birthday dessert.  Only downer was that the service was a bit slow; quite an odd wait to order and to pay.  Totally understandable as the restaurant was pretty busy for a weekday evening but when two other tables near us were visibly impatient for their own waiting stretches, you know it should probably be addressed.  Overall, a pleasant and classy birthday evening."}
{"text":"We go here for special occasions are never disappointed.  We are treated as you would expect in a premium restaurant.    Waiters very attentive, and knowledgable.  Recommend the risotto, and lamb.    The atmosphere is wonderful, the best feature of this establishment, after the food of course.   Located in a lovely ensemble of upscale shops.  Martin"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend to celebrate for his birthday and we both enjoyed it. Service was great, our server knew all the specials in great detail and was happy to answer our questions and make suggestions. He was also very attentive. For appetizers, we got bruschettas which were yummy. I got the pan-seared rainbow trout special while my boyfriend got the veal for our entrees. My rainbow trout was okay. Honestly, it was a bit tasteless and the vegetables with it were soggy and could use more flavouring but the presentation was nice. My boyfriend's veal was delicious and cooked to perfection. For dessert, we got the tiramisu which was delicious! I would come here again, but likely only for special occasions as there are cheaper and better places IMO."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner here for my mother and wifes birthday ... and it was the ABSOLUTE WORST. bread was cold and borderline stale. The pasta dishes my wife and sisters had were tastleless - it tasted like instant noodles with hot water as they didnt even bother to add salt. The gamberri (shirmp and scallop with some rose sauce and rice) dish I had was too salty.   Now, add a waiter with an attitude to this mix and this takes this place from horrible to unacceptable.    As regular of Spencers and Auberge du Pommier, this place doesnt even compare when it comes to the ambiance, service and the sophistication of the food. Want great food, nice ambiance and great service,  go to  Spencers and / or Auberge. Want to eat at something that looks like Grandma's kitchen, tasteless / overly salty food and crap service ... eat here!!!  They just lost the business of my whole family .. All 3 GENERATIONS who all live in the MISSISSAUGA ROAD area.   Will NEVER be back and will tell everyone I know."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place and the food is so good and it's the best Italian restaurant ever and awesome service and I high recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm compelled to write this review because I've truly had a pleasant and personable dining experience that had me yearning to plan my next visit and map my next culinary experience at this wonderful restaurant   This evening I was met by dining staff that made me feel like family - with an attention to detail that couldn't be more spectacular ensuring our comfort and care.   The open concept kitchen is mesmerizing and a joy to watch these trained professionals ply their craft and well orchestrated teamwork.   As the regular menu was complimented by a seasonal exotic selection Wild Game festival menu- I took the opportunity to try some non traditional offerings and I'm glad I took the leap of faith.   Though I'd note and to be honest - The eggplant parmigiana is a dish I would gladly give up meat for - thinly sliced - perfectly sauced , stacked and stuffed - as an everyday offering this is a must try and worthy of visiting the restaurant alone. It's truly hard to believe it's eggplant. Vegetarians take note!  From the Wild game menu - I went with the tasting board and it was an out of the ordinary experience we should be proud to have in the city.   The rabbit was divine - until this day I'd never had a rabbit experience quite so enjoyable and worthy of including in this review   The delicate ostrich sausage was something I hadn't expected - and was a pleasantly surprised at the texture and softness of flavours in a sausage .   The duck was perfect and sliced expertly as to allow one to savour each nuance of effort put forth in its preparation.   But the camel steak- this  was something that stopped me in my tracks... I'll truly never look at a camel the same having now had such a tender and flavourful slice of meat that had me staring at the plate incredulously that I was partaking in a dromedary.  I'd highly suggest you visit this neighbourhood gem that boasts a phenomenal everyday menu, an impressive wine collection and an addictive cappuccino that is accompanied by an In-house baked fresh everyday biscotti cookie with every cup!  Truly can't wait to go visit my family here once again :)"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends.  Our waiter was John and very knowledgeable and able to read the crowd very well.  Excellent place for a carnivore and they have a wide variety of game meats which are perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"My wife and two adult so'ns joined me last year for Xmas get together. We visited several restaurants in December and this was amongst the best. Our waiter made good, recommendations  for wine and entres. The food, ambience and service were all impeccable.  Really enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood go to spot for years that has never disappointed and this lunch visit was no exception!"}
{"text":"I'd say this is one of the best restaurants in Mississauga. The waiters are well trained and have clearly had a ton of experience and the food was absolutely amazing. It is priced per what you get, don't come here expecting it to be the same price as pub food because that's not what it is. Great for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Great Caprese Salad. Great Gnocchi Great Melanaze  Awesome people/great service ALWAYS Great Ambiance"}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant with a variety of stellar gourmet specials every night.  This place is always full.  The liver is a great dish.  Well worth the drive from Toronto."}
{"text":"My parents love this place so much they've been coming here since 1983! I was finally invited to join them last week.   I started with a portabello, roasted tomato, and arugula salad, which was fantastic! For my entree I had the soy glazed pickerel special with forbidden rice, shrimp, and chanterelle mushrooms. I was really impressed! I also tried bites of my dad's side of fettucine alfredo (made with housemade pasta) and my mom's melenzane - both were really good too.   For dessert we had the most amazing creme brulee, and a chocolate mousse that had good flavour but had rubbery pieces in it (I assume something just went wrong in the cooking process, but I'm not a food scientist so I have no idea).   It's decor was dated (I'm not sure if it has even changed since the 80's when my parents started going), but it felt very friendly and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a friendly restaurant in Mississauga with some wish to be a fine dining experience. Four of us met for dinner and in the end the food was good but not great. The rabbit loin and blackened halibut were very good but the veal picata bland; not bad, just boring. The warm salad - three portions, so not an accident - was doused in dressing which had too much vineger in it. The desserts were delicious (try the tiramisu or creme brulee) and the coffee was good. Please note, the menu follows the traditional Italian style with salads/soups, then pasta etc., followed by the mains. So if you want veggies or carbs be sure to order from each course as the mains are essentially protein with very little else."}
{"text":"I'll be straight with you, this is my favorite restaurant in all of Mississauga. This is my go to place above anything else when money isn't an issue. This little hidden gem has been a family favorite for a long time. The service has always been top notch and they've always treated us like family. And the food always has an amazing balance of flavor in every dish. It always blows my mind how well balanced and thought out the flavor profiles are. The have their static menu as well as daily specials. You can expect to come here with the opportunity of always trying something new or picking your favorite classics.  The environment is classy. It's kinda old school classy with the white table sheets and semi-formal ambiance.  House Pate special: So buttery and smooth. Made in house. A wonderful balance of sweet and savory. It's also very rich.  Bruschetta: It's not on the menu, but they've never turned down the request! Well seasoned, and toasted. Scrumptious.  Fegato: Calves' liver. It's meaty and hearty but very well refined. The sauce that they use with the fresh raspberries surrounding really balance each other out. Something in the sauce really balances out the iron taste of the liver so that the often \"iron-y\" taste of the liver is so much milder. The raspberries add a freshness to the dish that would otherwise be very rich. Needless to say I would have licked the plate clean if that was socially appropriate.  Rack of Lamb: One of the best rack of lambs around. Very tender, so soft it practically melts in your mouth. The seasoning is superb. You're hard pressed to find a better rack of lamb anywhere else, it's a classic at Rogues.  Black Pepper Pasta: Very rich. If you love creamy pasta sauces, you will love this dish.  They overheard my family talking about how it was my birthday and I couldn't decide on whether I wanted the tartufo or the creme brulee and before I knew it they brought me out a birthday sampler of both! Like I said, you feel like family. They are always so attentive and kind.  If you want to go to a restaurant for the overall package: great ambiance, wonderful service, and wonderful food, Rogues is definitely the restaurant I always recommend to all of my friends in Mississauga. They've never failed to impress me every time I've been."}
