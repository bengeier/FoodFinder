{"text":"Never been disappointed in the food here. Great hot and sour shrimp soup with mushrooms.  Fantastic curry! I like how they will modify the spice level on all their dishes for you too. Service is hit and miss . Sometimes I feel like I'm being rushed, and other times I can't find a waiter to save my life. However, I go here strictly for the food and it never disappoints. If they could get the service to match their food they'd be 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place !! Especially since they have a drive thru to pick up call in orders. Def recommend the pad thai ,drunkin noodles and pad see saw those are our family's favorite !!!!!"}
{"text":"From the outside you would never guess that the place was actually a nice restaurant on the inside. We were expecting something like a to-go counter with a couple noodle dishes, but this place has an extensive menu of authentic dishes. A couple fusion entrees as well, such as the eggplant stir fry which is more of a Cantonese style than Thai. We had the eggplant dish and the green papaya salad (\"Som Tam\"). You could tell from the quality of the food that it was cooked fresh by someone who really knows what they are doing.   You can order mild, medium, or spicy, I got medium which wasn't too hot, but much hotter would have been overpowering. I normally put hot sauce on everything, but not to the level that Thai people do. Service was great, but then again we were there on a Monday night and no one else was in the place.  Although the inside is well decorated, we showed up in shorts and got no hints that we were under-dressed."}
{"text":"Food was very ordinary. Despite asking for  a spice that was one level above \"medium\", the food was barely spicy. Very little crowd in the restaurant. Many other Thai restaurants that have better food. Service was efficient, but not particularly attentive."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I frequently dine in thai restaurants all over Phoenix. This place is decent, but ive had way better. Ive been here a hand full of times, however, i am not sure if id be returning. Besides the mediocre food, this place nickels and dimes you for everything. Most thai restaurants do not charge 2.00 extra for jasmine or brown race. Also last time I was there i was charged for carbonated water. They labeled it on the receipt as \"sparkling water\". There is a HUGE difference between carbonated water and sparkling water. Carbonated water coming out of a soda fountain is not sparkling water and most certaintly does not warrent a 2.00 surcharge. For all the nickel and diming i would expect this at a Scottsdale high end restaurant not some corner thai place in a college town."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff! My new favorite spot for Thai food :)"}
{"text":"Everything we get here is fresh and tasty. Unique Thai in the best way possible. Paht Thai is great, get it spicy. Tempura green beans with a surprise of cilantro that delivers a good spin. The best silver noodles we have had; add a little broccoli for nice crunchiness. Get a Thai iced tea; you'll love it. Great, friendly staff who remembers us easily, and knows what we want or what to recommend. Drop by anytime and you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Red curry is to die for! Spring rolls are good, spicy mustard is blow your socks off hot"}
{"text":"I was on the struggle bus trying to find a good thai restaurant in phoenix and i finally found one in Thai Rama. Drunken noodles are super flavorful and coconut soup is deliciously fresh with hints of fresh lime (not overly sweet like many others). my only \"issue\" was the menu has different names than what i am used to but I was delighted to see that they do indeed have all of my favorite dishes. this is the only place i'll get thai food from now on. highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"BEST. THAI. EVER!!!!! I eat a lot of Thai food and I go out of my way to hit up Thai Rama. I love it! Tom Yum soup is my go to a well as the garlic chicken."}
{"text":"Another favorite Thai place which is sadly underrated because they don't pick up the phone or other issues. The Mango Delight and Pineapple fried rice here are so delicious. I usually call ahead and pick up. It's always been correct to my specified spice level with great flavor and fresh ingredients. I know it's not \"authentic\" but I wish they offered shrimp puffs or cream cheese wontons like other Thai places, but I can't fault them for that.  If you love Thai food I suggest you try this place for yourself, as the reviews are pretty mixed here. Personally, I've never had a bad meal from Thai Rama :)"}
{"text":"Thairama has a Thai family cooking family thai food. That says more than I could, especially in Phoenix.  Thai Greece curry vegetable came with Bok Choy, broccoli, jalape√±o, carrots, Napa cabbage, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, green beans, and baby corn in coconut sauce. Veggie lovers dream!  Told them I didn't need/want the rice and they threw an egg roll in just because. I think that speaks a lot about how unrude these folks are.  Thanks for being awesome."}
{"text":"Thai Rama is some great food. The only thai place that Ive had that can match the spiciness I had in Thailand. Always good, friendly and quick service. Fairly priced. Pad Thai Chicken, is my go to dish and I always ask for the spiciest they can make it. You wont regret this choice for Thai food."}
{"text":"Ok so don't know where to start. I guess the bathroom would be a good start. I saw the biggest roaches since Vietnam unfortunately I ordered the food before hand so I had to swallow hard . I was trying to get a look at the kitchen but was stone walled so you know what that means. I ordered the pot Stickers and every time I bit into one a bunch of water squeezed out so I new they were frozen. It was like tasting something dank and wet ashtray comes to mind. I hope I don't get sick. If there was a zero star that's what I would give them.   Ps the water is from Costco Kirkland brand nasty as hell."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food and always drive past this place so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Phad Thai and Thai Ice Tea. It wasn't the best I've had but I would probably go back. The ice tea was definitely not sweet enough, but overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"Ugh...that pretty much sums up my experience at Thai Rama.  I was in AZ visiting family and took my family to eat Thai, expecting Char's to still be there.  When we arrived, saw that name was changed to Thai Rama...no big deal.  Place looked clean and the waitress was friendly.  I ordered my usual Thai dishes: - Pad Thai (weird medicine taste...definitely wrong sauce) - Pork Larb (too sour...not enough fish sauce...not as spicy as I requested) - Pork Rad Nah (sauce tasted too bland...lots of sauce though) - Tom Yum Gung (sigh...I can still remember the disappointment I felt as I tasted this seemingly \"canned\" soup)  I guess I am used to the authentic Thai food from Chars and Thai restaurants in L.A., so I had high expectations.  It's hard to find a good, authentic Thai restaurant in AZ.  I miss Chars!    Would I go here again?  No."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I was unfairly worried that the levels of heat here would correspond to the lack of spiciness found in Arizona, rather than appropriately Thai. Pleasantly surprised to find that they Thaied it up with the heat.  The drunken noodles (Kwediew Kaprow - phat kee mow) were YUMMY. The Ho Mok Ta Lay (seafood with red curry) was the perfect mix of savory, sweet, and spicy. I was a very very happy girl!"}
{"text":"The panang curry is amazing!! It is totally cravable! I have been there for takeout and to eat in. It is the best thai restaurant I know of in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I think 3.5 stars would be most accurate, it was good enough to go back, not amazing, and certainly not mediocre or bad.   I went to Thai Rama with three friends, wanting to try something other than Thai Basil (which the one on University seems to be slipping in quality a bit) and Thai Elephant, (which also seems on par with this place). We had the green curry with chicken, shrimp pad Thai, and some mango shrimp stir fry type thing. All were good, I would definitely say it runs more on the spicy side, and the food was what we expected.   The interior decor is very bland, but I wouldn't change a rating strictly on that, I'm there for the food. Service was consistent, didn't go above and beyond, but we were not left looking for someone either.  Waters stayed full, and our needs were taken care of in a timely manner.   We also did the coconut ice cream, and fried bananas, which was good, but again, not the best I've had. The ice cream could have actually had a little more pronounced coconut flavor, and a lighter batter for the bananas or more of a pastry crust would have brought them up to 4 stars.   Price was reasonable and the ambiance was good. Overall, if you like the other Thai restaurants in Tempe, this one isn't going to blow you out of the water, but it does serve as a nice alternative."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food!  We got a mix of curry, padthai and another chicken dish.  This is the first Thai place in many years where the food isn't over-powered by fish sauce.  There's still a hint (hence the four stars vice five) but not too bad.  We ordered takeout so can't comment on the service, although, our food was done on time."}
{"text":"Originally loved this place when we were only ordering take out. Then we decided to eat there... Horrible experience! Food and portion size are good but the service is poor and the dining room a mess! We waited 20+ mins after finishing our meal for anyone to come back to our table and there was water dripping from the ceiling tiles. Definitely order take out... Our experience ruined this restaurant for us and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here plenty of times and the food is always great and service is spot on! They will accommodate special requests with no problem! I love the Tom Yum soup, and they were kind enough to make it vegetarian and add noodles! Also the green curry and red curry are favorites, along with the coconut mango sticky rice for dessert!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for so long I can't believe I haven't reviewed Thai Rama yet!   In two words: delicious perfection! The food always has a wonderful balance between flavor and spiciness and the sauces are just the right consistency. The Gai Tohm Khah, #23 garlic chicken and panang beef are my absolute favorites.    They were recently closed for a few months for building repairs after a taxi drove into the restaurant and I can't emphasize how much my friends and I missed it. We tried other Thai restaurants while we waited for it to reopen but they all lacked compared to Thai Rama.   Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry.  We went to Thai Rama in December (before Christmas) and the smell was so foul we couldn't stay (not sure if they were having a plumbing problem or if it always smells that way).  Maybe we'll try again some day..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Thai food, then dont go to Thai Rama, it was more like chinese food! And yes there is a HUGE difference.  The veggies were not fresh, they seemed to be canned.  The whole meal reminded me of the canned chinese food you get at the grocery store called \"CHOW MEIN\" and yes I tried canned chinese food from the grocery store.  When I was about 10 or so and HATED it!  My white grandmother did her best to \"switch\" things up for dinner while she watched us. god bless her! xoxoxox"}
{"text":"Our FAV Thai place! Service is friendly and things are made to order - so it can be a bit slow, but WORTH IT!  Lunch service is quick if you order off the lunch menu. I am a huge wimp so I always order mild. Soups are yum, my fav thing on the menu is PadThai mild with shrimp, extra sauce. Hubby loves the Panang Curry medium."}
{"text":"Made a big mistake by going there for lunch. The waitress was rude and unprofessional. Had to walk out with the ordered food in a box, will never go back again. They deserve a -ve star, Yelp didnt provide me that option."}
{"text":"We ordered from Thai Rama thru a delivery service. Delivery service was great however, the food from the actual restaurant was not, entirely. We ordered wonton soup which looked amazing but unfortunately tasted overly salty and greasy. Also got the angel wings which we should have ordered more of that because it was the only thing flavorably good. Thai iced tea was ok but yeah we had to dilute both it and the soup to make it more palatable. They should probably discontinue delivery takeout cuz it seems to lose something in the delivery (pricey & portions) . Thai delivery can be done right- Los Angeles has it down with TG Express if you're ever staying at a hotel in downtown area - if only a Phoenix Thai place would take a lesson and follow. There'd be bookoo bucks to be made."}
{"text":"Hallelujah! Nothing saves you more when you live in suburbia than fabulous Thai food!  The Som Tum appetizer is the perfect starter - raw papaya, chili, lime, carrot, cabbage...fresh and zesty. Their curry is superb but I stick by their pad thai, paht see iiew and kaprow are all you need...though there is something that is drawing me to try the evil jungle noodles.   Typical out of date decor and overtextured walls but all part of the experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered red curry and papaya salad(some yum) for those of you who knows what authentic Thai food are this not all authentic traditional Thai food. My curry was plain taste white color and all I tasted was coconut (coconut milk drown in it) my papaya salad was sweet not supposed to taste sweet at all with 2 shrimp in it. I also ordered desert sticky rice with mangos, look so unappealing and unappetizing. I am shock they wouldn't invest more in their dish and taste. I am Asian therefor what Thai Rama served to their customers are all cut corners another words we called that American eyes food. I make my red curry and papaya salad I can say 10 times better than Thai Rama. I wouldn't mine paying for their food but if you're going to charge your customers an arm and leg I suggested you put more investment  and thoughts to your cooking. I am very disappointed I had to pay almost $50 bucks for something I call it lazy and being greedy serving food that only the people that doesn't know what authentic Thai food actually taste and looks like. And of course to them its delicious. Will never go there again. I will cut my lost. And give them 1 star."}
{"text":"Let's start with an easy tip. If you are a first timer here and are new to Thai food I strongly recommend you start with pad Thai. This is a safe bet as it won't kill you, and leave you with a \"Thai food is too spicy for me\" feeling. Look, the reality is Thai food is freaking hot.  Thai Rama is my favorite spot for Thai. Introduced by a friend several years ago, Thai Rama is a go to place for me when I'm in Tempe.   The service is always good, the food is outstanding. As with all Thai food the combination of flavors awakens the soul, or at least your sweat glands. I never order above medium heat and often times find myself in a full on sweat. My friend orders extra hot and never breaks a sweat. I guess we are all wired differently.  If you follow my advice and start off by ordering pad Thai, here is my next recommendation. On subsequent trips I would recommend that you go through the menu and try different items one by one. You will soon find many favorites on their extensive menu.  Finally, if you do by chance eat something super spicy and want to put the fire out, grab a beer."}
{"text":"service was friendly, and prompt. Drinks were large and free refills, which I really appreciated. But as far as the food goes it was pretty average. I agree with some other reviewers who stated that the sauces seem watery, and the veggies seem canned. i had the yellow curry chicken. it's flavor was acceptable, but certainly not the best I've had. HOT was the spice level I requested, but disappointingly the spice level AND the food temp were somewhere around luke warm.  food = 2 stars service = 4 stars"}
{"text":"I have lived very close to this Thai-rama in Chandler for years, and finally started going there about six months ago.  The food is absolutely wonderful.  Always fresh.    However, I am only giving them three stars due to the service.  As another reviewer mentioned, the service is getting worse.  The first time I went there, it seemed okay, but my last visit for lunch a full hour.  The restaurant was crowded, but there were only 3 wait staff.  After about 10 minutes, our first waiter asked us what we wanted to drink. 15 minutes after that, we still didn't have our drinks. Another waitress came by and asked for our drink order.  We told her the other waiter took our order and she replied he is busy, so she will get them. By that time, we also knew what we wanted for lunch, so we placed our food order.   After about another 10 minutes, the waitress came around with a large tray of soup bowls.  They pretty much served half the restaurant soup at the same time.  Finally, after another wait, we received our lunch.  By the time we got the check and paid, it was an hour since we had walked in the door and sat down.    Again, the food here is wonderful, but they really need to work on the service aspect.  Although the restaurant is not too large, when full, they should have at least 4 servers.  I felt bad for the people sitting next to us.  Although they ordered their food about 10 minutes before we did, they didn't get it until about 10 minutes after we received our lunch.  I could tell they were not very happy."}
{"text":"Made the biggest mistake by going there for a family lunch. One of the waitresses were so rude taking our order and overall being unprofessional. We called waitress twice to order more food but she wanted us to wait for 10 min because she was busy fixing the computer. Will never go back again. They deserve a no star but Yelp doesn't provide that option."}
{"text":"Not the worst Thai food.. Certainly not the best. A little over priced. They forgot my brown rice even though they charged me $2 for it. I would live if I never went there again."}
{"text":"Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over 5 years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. (those are usually the best) Whenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different... But not always.  OK.. 1. Thai tea... the best in the valley!  2. Pad thai with chicken... level 5 - 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and it'll still be just as good. 3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots, & pineapple.... level 5 again.... my fave 4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better!  Oh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service.  If you like Thai, check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had! Literally started a Yelp just to give Thai Rama the rating it deserves. My favorite dishes: pad see ew, spicy eggplant, and tom ka soup.  Also have had the yellow curry and pad Thai. Everything I've mentioned above is easily better than any dish of those I've had anywhere else by far. The spices and flavored in these dishes are excellent! Staff has always been friendly. Nice call in/drive thru pick up feature as well which I've done every time and orders are always on time. Recently had the jungle noodles too just due to reading reviews on here. They were good as well but I prefer the other dishes mentioned above. I always want to try new dishes but the ones I'm used to are so good it's hard to stray, lol. I get the fried tofu with all the dishes. It's been excellent every time. Keep up the great work Thai Rama! When my family comes to visit this is the first place I will take them :)"}
{"text":"Ate here last night...excellent eggrolls and curry.  I have a pretty severe mushroom allergy and I feel like I'm constantly pissing servers off with my strict limitations, didn't feel that at all here.  In fact our service was excellent and our waiter actually was so cool we ended up staying longer than we anticipated."}
{"text":"I heard about Thai Rama from several friends and have seen the parking lot packed several times, so my husband and I decided to try it. There were several buckets laying around the floor catching leaks from the roof. No, it wasn't raining, but the place looked dated.  Our waitress was nice, but not attentive. We ordered the Satay (6.55) for an appetizer and the Paht Pik Thed (Pepper Steak) with chicken and the Shrimp Snow Peas (10.95). It took F-O-R-E-V-E-R to get the Satay and another 30 minutes after that to get our entrees. I had already finished my Thai Iced Tea and half a glass of water, with no request for refills.   [Another lady across the dining room had ordered food to-go (before we arrived) and was still waiting. She began complaining after the waitress came out and told her they had only just started on her Mango Delight, while her Pad Thai had been sitting in the to-go box, waiting. She was not happy, to say the least.]  Despite the wait, the Satay was very good. Unfortunately, both of the sauces that came with our entrees were very watery and we had more meat in the appetizer than our meals. The sauce was so sweet, I could not eat the pineapples in the dish. The portions were also small for the price. Finally, I was asked for a refill after our waitress took our plates away. It took another 5 mins to ask if we wanted dessert. My husband insisted we try the Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice (3.95). Thirty five minutes later (yes, we timed it) we had our dessert. It was not bad, but I was done with sweet stuff for the night.   We set the credit card out on the table to be taken with the plates. Once again, we had to wait for that. The waitress finally took our plates away, then returned to tell us she would grab our ticket. The card was still on the edge of the table. A few minutes later, an extremely rude waitress (not ours) passed our table, threw the receipt book across the table, and gave us a dirty look. What was that all about and why the heck didn't she take the card?! She stormed back over to collect it, with the same look on her face. There were no words exchanged with this \"lady\" let alone with our own waitress and we were extremely patient and low maintenance considering the wait and quality of the food. We paid, and got the heck out of there. In the end, we had spent over 2 hours, $45 and I still could have eaten something on the way home. After that experience, I will not be back.  Overall:  Food was not worth the mood we left with.  Service was sooooo SLOW! Spent over 2 hours there for just two people!  Waitress never checked on us, I was asked if I wanted a refill after my meal.   No sense of urgency among the three waitresses and the seven full tables they had.  Phone was constantly ringing loudly and no one picked it up even though all three waitresses walked by it several times. Annoying!! Not to mention, for the person on the other side of the phone.  The table legs and feet were too bulky in the booth. No room for my feet and I'm only 5'2."}
{"text":"The waiter spilled curry sauce all over me and didn't even offer an apology.  Not only did I pay for a crappy meal but I also had to pay for my dry cleaning.  Don't go the service sucks and so does the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Took my mom here for her first Thai experience she loved it. She will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love thai and I love this place. I like hot and this place is the ONLY place that can make it hot enough for me (I'm talking level 6 or 7 (double thai hot)). Their panang curry is great. And I am a big fan of their drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Best Thai Restaurant I've tried, beats Thai Basil and Swaddee Thai in Chandler. I've only gone there for lunch, I love their lunch specials: soup, spring roll, Thai chips and an entree for under $8! You can ask for hot Jasmine tea as well - it's free!  The food is less Americanized than other Asian places I've tried. They are usually really busy at lunch, but I've never waited long to be seated. The waiters are attentive.  I recommend trying their garlic chicken or their sweet and sour chicken. There is plenty of white lean meat in all of their chicken entrees!"}
{"text":"we love this place!!  me and a couple friends here come here all the time and the food is always perfect we always get the pineapple fried rice and chicken saut√©! you have to eat here!"}
{"text":"I am not done with Thai Rama.  Enough people, even close friends whose judgment I normally trust, have had good experiences there.  After about a half dozen times, I have been universally disappointed.  Granted, I have only eaten in one time, maybe they just have take-out issues, but I don't believe that to be the problem.  The Pad Thai is bizarrely sweet, like almost some sort of off-brand honey BBQ.  That isn't exactly the flavor, but that is what it made me think of.  Everything else, both Green and Yellow curries, as well as assorted rice and vegetable dishes just tasted bland and like they were using second-tier produce.  Maybe I just need to pull the ideal dish from the other yelper favorites, but until then, Thai Rama is significantly sub-par in my book."}
{"text":"Love this family owned restaurant best Tom Yum soup. Now the servers are attentive and the food is delicious. The red curry, squid, eggplant and chicken and broccoli are delicious."}
{"text":"This was an excellent dinner! Everything and I mean everything was so fragrant, delicious, and wonderful . Ambiance isn't really there, but the wait staff is pleasant,helpful and accommodating. The owner has been there 22 years and pitches in right along side his staff. Definitely a place I would return to. We had a large group of 18 and all were impressed with the food!! Favorites? Everything!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food,  and would always return,  but one of there servers has a rude demeanor! Every time I go here she talks to people very very rudely,  I came in with my sister and friend to get our Thai fix that I had been craving,  she greeted me at the door and told her that I wanted to do a take out order,  she rolled her eyes at me,  and told me to go to the counter,  I did and placed my order with a very nice younger guy.   He offered us waters and I talked to him about a different Thai restaurant that I worked in,  VERY NICE YOUNG Man.   But as I was waiting for my food the other girl that was there was Rude beyond belief,  as she was talking phone orders I heard her,  it was not nice,  I felt sorry for the other person on the other end of the phone.   Who talks like that to people? Oh I forgot,  she does! I wanted to stand up and just yell at her for being so rude to people,  THAI RAMA CHANDLER needs to get rid of this girl! You are going to continue to loose customers!  Other than this,  the food is always on point and really good! I will continue to go back but will request for a different server other than her!"}
{"text":"Food was very salty and I was charged a 3% credit card fee for using my Atm card . Who does that ? I spend more than 50 dollars for dinner and your still charging me that fee and not telling me ahead of time . Bye Felicia ! Never again"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service sucks. Took forever to get service and the check. Looking for a new place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Riprama, ordered pad thai, lors of noodles, very little chicken,.and ONE shrimp, first an last time there!!"}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed when we come here. Great service and flavorful food, especially those Angel Wings!!!"}
{"text":"I went in to get a simple yellow curry for myself and my two boys.  Two were supposed to be no spice.  One mild.  They were too spicy to eat.  The rice was dry and had no flavor.  The Chicken was way over cooked.  I called and they could do nothing about the issue.  They offered to make a replacement meal but I couldn't drive all the way back."}
{"text":"I came here with friends.  I have never had Thai food really, wasn't my thing, so I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken from the \"specialty\" part of the menu ($10.25), and when it came to the table it looked lackluster and was lacking in both taste and value. Not exactly the best thing to order at a Thai restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly in allowing me to return the food and get something else from the menu.  So... as a responsible adult... I ordered the Chicken Tenders with Fries from the Kids Menu for $4.25. It was pretty good. I am guessing it wasn't custom crafted in the kitchen but nonetheless it was probably the best Thai food I've had in my life. It should be noted that they presented the plate of Chicken Tenders with Fries on what I assume was my old food plate, along with a healthy dose of Hunt's Ketchup packages, which was very fancy.  I left a $5~ and something tip because I felt bad about sending the other food back and then ordering Chicken Tenders with Fries from the Kids Menu. It was all good though.  Best Thai Chicken Tenders out there, hands down."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the planet. Not even Thai food in Thailand tastes as good as Thai-Rama! This place reminds me of Seinfeld and the episode of the \"Soup Natzy\" because it's soo good you practically begged them for some of their food. They're bad service and 18 % gratuity and 3% percent credit card fee would have made me go elsewhere but because it's so good I am willing to turn the other cheek.#nosoupforyou"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile.  Ordered the Beef Masaman curry--medium spicy-- and the BBQ pork dish (R's choice, not mine). Shouldn't have let R ordered since he isn't versed with Asian food, but I'm trying to be less bossy so I didn't say anything :-) The BBQ pork was sliced pork in a sweet shiny, sticky red sauce, kinda like Cantonese style, but not.  Anyway, that was a thumbs down. I don't blame the restaurant, it's just not the kind of thing you should order in a Thai restaurant anyway.  The beef curry was excellent, a little sweet, but just spicy enough. I ordered pad thai as well, but the waitress did not pick up that order and the kitchen had closed when I inquired about it. Oh well...another excuse to come back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"This is NOT the place to go for Thai food in Phoenix. I've eaten at just about every Thai Restaurant in the area, and this is by far the worst one. The food was overpriced and bland. The coconut curry sauce was very watered down, the veggies were limp and had lost color due to there lack of freshness, there was only three pieces of tofu in my dish, and they charged me $2 extra for brown rice. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. There are only two places that I recommend for Thai food in the area; Thai Basil and Thai Elephant. You will get a much better value, better food, better atmosphere and better service at these places. Stay away from Thai Rama if you don't want to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow. Regular customer just got denied service because they decided to close early. None of the normal servers were there so I'm wondering what happened? Suffice to say, I won't be back again because that shit was really rude."}
{"text":"The chicken was stale and undercooked. This place was much better earlier, it seems to have deteriorated  over time. I wouldn't go back for sure ."}
{"text":"Their Pad Thai was one of the worst I've ever had. It was bland, dry, and cost $10! Although their serving size was descent, I hardly ate any of it. Hot sauce wasn't even able to help save this dish. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food gets 5 stars.  The service only gets 3+. Service was friendly but they did not have enough staff for a busy Friday night.  As for the food....the Evil Jungle Noodles (Med Hot) were awesome.  The cucumber relish that comes with the Thai Toast might be even better.  Will be making a trip back in the near future for sure!!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat here, try to come during the dinner hours.  The staff during the lunch shift is so incredibly rude and has always made us feel so uncomfortable despite being multiple-repeat customers.   If here for lunch, I and my significant other are often rushed, pestered, pressured to buy more and stared down for the majority of the time making us feel so incredibly uncomfortable.  On one occasion we were in the middle of eating our lunch when the waitress came over to our table and actually told us very rudely that we would need to \"hurry up and finish\" because they needed to close to get ready for the dinner shift.  The dinner shift, although a much more pleasant and entirely different atmosphere - sometimes as equally if not just as rude servers/ hosts as day-shift.  Also, the last time we were here, my Fiance' found a thick little strand of jet-black hair in his pad Thai. We have since decided to stop coming here altogether, which saddens me because I have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for so long the wait staff know me and my family by name. The food is so good if you are looking for authentic thai food this is the place to go. Best curry in town and the desert is to die for. I can't wait until summer when mangos and sticky rice is back on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went after the lunch rush so service as slow. Friendly but slower than one would expect. That's why only 4 stars. The Panang curry was awesome, I requested mild spice as other yelp reviews said they were on the spicy side I could have gone one more degree but delish non the less. The chicken Satay came served different than I'm use to but it was awesome as well. I will definitely come here again and try the Tom Yum soup (they spell if differently) . =)"}
{"text":"We arrived 9pm for some late night Thai, and even though it was empty and near closing they were very welcoming. Our server had great personality, and the food was outstanding. I had number 19- sweet and sour. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for Thai food. The Panang and Green curries are fabulous, as is the eggplant dish. Tonight I tried the tom kha soup and was thrilled with it; the coconut milk flavor without the heaviness of a curry with loads of seafood in it. Will definitely order this again!"}
{"text":"A-OK says it all.  Not exceptional food, but overall great value.  Pad Thai is good, and the green curry is pretty solid.  Hard to beat the price for lunch if you're in the area, otherwise I'll stick to Tottie's which is closer to home."}
{"text":"5 star for tom yum soup served there :P"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate here. While the food was alright, the service sucked...and I even ordered take out! I order the Panang Curry and rice enough for 3 ppl when I placed my order. However, when I got my food I asked for hot sauce and the manager gave me 1 tiny cup of hot sauce so I asked for 2 more. He made a face and said he can only give me enough for 1 person and that any more would cost extra. (are you kidding me??...this is Thai food we're talking about. it's supposed to be spicy). He said $1 for each addl hot sauce. Rude customer service, wont be going back here."}
{"text":"I am an out of towner, but when I visit my mom, we always come here for lunch.  The lunch specials are a great value.  I love the basil chicken, it has bamboo shoots.  I order it hot at an 8 out of 10 on the heat scale.  My mom loves the beef and green beans.  My husband Joe also likes the basil chicken, but he doesn't order it as hot as I do.  The food is fresh and the service is great.    My mom just told me they renovated the outside.  She said it looks great, I can't wait to see it."}
{"text":"My father really likes the fried rice and my mother likes the evil jungle princess. The soup is plenty for three people so Id recommend ordering smaller portion. The evil jungle princess curry is not as thick as the other curry. It is more like a soup."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd favorite go-to stop for Thai food, mainly because it's close to my house. We usually order take-out but occasionally dine-in. Our favorites are #43 Evil Jungle Noodles, #35 Panang Curry & #34 Yellow Curry. I agree with other reviewers that service here can be inconsistent. We've sat around clearly finished with our meal (we call it \"being held hostage\") waiting way to long for someone to bring us our check/boxes for leftovers. This is mainly the reason we get take-out, but the food here is  consistently good. Oh, and their iced-tea is excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to what feels like every Thai place in Arizona. This is definitely one of my favorites. This place has pickup and is reasonably priced. My only complaints would be that this place is a bit dingy and old."}
{"text":"Service is very slow, wait 15 minutes in front desk to get table, nobody come to front desk and they should hire more waiter/waitress. Many other review also mentioned slow service. Food is ok though. It is not a god place for lunch particularly if you have to be back to work after lunch"}
{"text":"Great food, but if you order hot on the food, you better bring a fire extinguisher! We had medium and it was still very hot. You are able to share your dish if you like. I am going to come back here. Really good food for a little place"}
{"text":"I had dinner at the Thai Rama two days ago. It wasn't an awful dining experience, but I'm not sure I would go here again.   My friend and I ordered the egg rolls (sorry, I don't remember the Thai name), and they were okay. Two pieces, small (but the price was $2, so what did I expect?), and an average filling - something I would expect from frozen egg rolls.  We're both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu, but were slightly disappointed with the options. Three of the items included oyster sauce, and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or red/green curry vegetables. I ordered the green curry vegetables (medium hot), and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables (mild - and she stressed MILD). We waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didn't mind my dish - it was waaaaay spicier than medium, but I don't mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. My friend didn't like her dish at all, mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish. We spent $25 total, and I'm not sure it was worth it.  The service was slow, but the waitresses were very friendly. Overall, I would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Good, fast alternative for something to take back to your room.  The food is tasty, the portions good, and the price is reasonable.  An added bonus is that you can have a cocktail while you wait.  There was never a crowd when I was there, which, given the food, is a little bit of a mystery. But I was on business mid-week."}
{"text":"Today 4/28/2017 I decided to have lunch at Thai Rama to go . I placed an order for Drunken Noodles which I've had many times before . Placing the order was difficult as the women on the phone was very rude taking my order, I asked for broccoli and carrots in my meal as they should be in addition to mushrooms and a fried egg which I knew would be at extra charge . She expressed that it already had carrots and broccoli so why would I want more . I asked for chicken as my meat of choice and she began to close the call even though I wasn't done ordering . I quickly told her I wasn't done and continued to order crab puffs . Then asked for my total . She said it would be 13.15 . As I arrived to Thai Rama I walked up to the register and wasn't attended to for 4 minutes , then I was approached by a young women who asked \"pick up or dine in\" , I said \"I am picking up for Rene \" I was given my food and a total of 18.50 , wasn't too happy about that but okay . When I left I checked my meal at a red light and I noticed I didn't have any mushrooms , fried egg or chicken so I called and told the person on the phone what my issue was and I was told nothing could be done about it . At this point I was hoping I didn't have to return to work from my lunch break so I could address the issue and I was simply told \"we can't do anything about it sir\" I finalized the call by saying \"Thank you but I will not be eating there again\""}
{"text":"Went back for some more wonderful cuisine.  Had the Chicken wings which were amazingly tender, sweet and perfectly cooked.   Unfortunately,  I have to drop a rating star for the following: We also ordered the Larhb, which I envisioned as a dish similar to chicken lettuce wraps.  When it arrived to the table both of us were completely blown away by the powerful odor.  It looked beautiful.  There were small pieces of white white chicken piled next to a wedge of pale cabbage.  Small spears of red onion stuck out like cactus.  But the smell was overwhelming- and not it was not good.  It reeked with a sourness that I assumed was just an element or spice that I had not ever experienced before.  I thought, if this is a \"bad\" smell as if the chicken had expired then why was the server seeming unmoved?  I tried removing the onions thinking perhaps they were the culprit, but it did not help.  The putrid fumes just would not stop-literally causing me to gag.  I felt horrible when I tried explaining to the server that it was not what we were expecting and apologizing for asking him to please remove it from the table.  He was very polite and offerred to make another without onions.  It was too late, as we were unable to remove the smell from our memory.  The rest of the meal was deliscious as usual. Still wondering what created that sulfuric odor.  Black Beets?"}
{"text":"Love this place! We do take-out all the time - the staff is so friendly and the food is delicious! We especially recommend the panang curry with chicken."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night and it was empty, so the service was awesome! The food was delicious and just the right amount of spicy. I thought the prices were very reasonable and we'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I have ever eaten.  Native to San Francisco I can say its very authentic.  The owner was nice enough to come to our table just returning from Thailand with a delicious new coconut desert.  All the dishes are delicious and also vegitarian friendly.  Staff are always friendly and happy to see you return.  This establishment has been here for years and in a ever changing city like Phoenix that should say something. By far one of my favorites places to eat thai food."}
{"text":"We keep coming back here at least once a month. This was my first experience with Thai Food and every other Thai restaurant I try gets judged off of this one, and it is still amongst the best. The young waiter is funny because he looks so chill but he is very effective and the rest of the staff is really nice. On to the food: Even after having Thai in San Fran this is still one of the best in the biz, flavor is on point and always leaves you wanting to come back form more. I've had a couple of other places in the valley but they do not compare. Try everything here!!!"}
{"text":"My food was delicious and the waitress were nice! They didn't bother me every 5 minutes and I was able to enjoy my meal. Spicy does mean spicy here though!"}
{"text":"After passing this restaurant for years, we decided to give it a try. The food was good, and the owner was friendly and attentive to our needs. I tried the Paht See-iw with beef...so good! I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I got on a Thai kick last summer and ate at this place 2 or 3 times a week for a month or so.  Service was friendly.    I tried different menu items each time and never found one I didn't like.  Consistantly good food and service.      They only had one Thai beer and that was in the bottle, bummer.  Atmosphere was OK.    I started using the take out window towards the end of my run and liked the convenience.  May be too convenient."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are reasonably price. The wait can be a bit long but the food is good. The pad Thai and the yellow curry are my favorite!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good Thai Food and is reasonably priced.  The Pineapple curry is excellent, highly recommended!  We typically order the food for pick up, as they have a drive-thru pickup window, which is convenient. The service inside is good, unless its busy, then be prepared for a little wait."}
{"text":"I went with the girls and more or less enjoyed our meal. Oddly enough our table had a Hebrew theme....   I'm not much of an ice tea person but I quite enjoyed theirs. It has a \"woody\" flavor kind of like bamboo. I'm not sure what it's called though...  It was my first time and I wasn't that hungry so I just stuck with good old chicken satay. The food came and everyone was happy. My only real complaint is that not one dish came out at the same time. I might be as bold to put a couple minutes in-between each plate so that there were 15 minutes in between the first and the last of the food arriving. Besides that there wasn't much to complain about but there wasn't anything to write home about either."}
{"text":"Lunch special! This place is awesome two drinks and two meals for under 25$ and everyone seems friendly here. :) food is great. Alittle spicy ;)"}
{"text":"This location used to be the best Thai restaurant in Tempe (Chars Thai).  Everything has gone downhill since Thai Rama took over.  The menu has significantly changed, the service (although not Chars best trait) is horrible and to top it off, I have gotten food poisoning twice from this location.  The first time I was not sure if it was this location, but when it happened again, I was sure.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"We had the Chicken Pad Thai and Thai Fried Rice and it was AMAZING! We've tried several different Thai restaurants, and this one is close to the best! Customer service was exceptional and best part about it, there's a drive through for pick-up orders!"}
{"text":"- the waitress was friendly, bland, and close to useless - the food was bland and way beyond expensive - the restaurant is in a great location (close to the freeway) - the bill was stunning for what the 6 people in our party received. - the place was empty, except for one other table (with a couple)  I'm not sure how this place has stayed open for several years, since they have so little traffic.  I'm thinking that it's a mafia money-laundering front, and I would recommend that my friends/family stay away.   Bottom line:  don't bother"}
{"text":"If you've come to Phoenix from a big city that has good asian food, as I have, then you probably know what I mean when I say that it's really hard to find the same thing here.  I really love Thai food and Thai Rama is the best I've found in the Tempe/Chandler/Mesa/Gilbert part of the East Valley.   My two favorites with any Thai place are pad prik khing (available also on the lunch menu) and drunken noodle (listed under the Thai name at TR).  My third, \"once in a blue moon\" dish, is panang curry.  They do all three well, with the pad prik being the best.  I've come here 25-30 times over the last five years and never once had a disappointing meal, nor have I ever had poor or slow service.   As many a reviewer has mentioned, the lunch special is a real bargain that will fill you up.  I think they have ten items or so available for that, though it's not the full menu.  It's great to see that they've finally gone to seven days a week.  In the past, their only weakness was that they were only open six days a week (like so many independent places)."}
{"text":"I normally don't like to rag on a place but have been coming here for a while because the food is excellent. Excellent. But, the service has been consistently worse and worse. I'm not one to rag on a family place for bad service -- normally I'm not expecting super fast highway food. But, this place is getting to the point of ridiculous. Took us an hour and a half for dinner the other night. Not terribly busy. One server who was friendly and one busser who was doing... what? We couldn't figure out. Also, as one commentor noted, they'll let the phone ring and ring and ring without picking it up if too busy. Drove my boyfriend nuts and definitely made for a less than stellar meal.   Will we be back again? Likely. The food is fantastic. But we'll probably only go when we have an hour+ to spare."}
{"text":"The worst Thai food I've had. Greasy and over cooked by an staff who appears to hate their job. I've tried this place a few times as it's close to home but I have always been disappointed."}
{"text":"The Thai place in the area.  I really enjoy the general feel of the place, the staff is very friendly and the remodeled facade makes it appear much classier. The color and lighting are a nice balance of light and dark, giving the restaurant a comfortable, private aura without appearing cramped or dim. While the dress code is casual, I'd feel perfectly comfortable coming here on somewhat dressy occasions. I've eaten here many times and have never disliked the food. Portions are generous while prices are low. Unlike many other places I've been to, medium here actually is moderately spicy instead of \"just short of our absolute spiciest\". The meat is always delicious whatever form you're eating it in, and the curries are spectacular. Don't forget to get some Thai iced tea with your food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. I am always ordering the number 23rd which is their famous chicken on fire. Food is very delicious and here is the best chicken . The service always is good and fast. Quiet place for lunch or dinner. If you are looking for good food at a reasonable price Thai Rama will be a good choice. I wish they have a little bigger parking lot , but works fine. Another thing I want to mention is when you order spicy food make sure you ask how spicy is."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last year, and like others have mentioned, I've found it a little hit or miss on taste and quality.  Tonight I got my usual favorites of Pad Thai and the Yellow Curry, and the total came to over $22. That seems expensive to me, at least compared to many other Thai restaurants I've been to.  And also, they want $2 for a side of rice. That's a lot. At least they give you a good amount to begin with. There were also no shrimps in the Pad Thai, despite being listed on the menu.  And what Thai place doesn't have limes?"}
{"text":"Thai Rama is our regular Thai place. We get it regularly (usually do takeout) and we pretty much always order: Evil Jungle Princess (curry) and Kwediew Kaprow (better known as pad kee mow), both with chicken.  Intrigued by a name like Evil Jungle Princess, aren't you? This is a fabulous, creamy, coconut milk-based curry, loaded with veggies. The sauce is so good you'll drink it off the plate.  Kwediew Kaprow includes the flat rice noodles, lightly spiced, but a real delight...one of the best pad kee mows I've had anywhere.  Prices are roughly 10 bucks a plate for dinner, and even cheaper for lunch. This place makes a great lunch up to 6 or 8 people if you're in the area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is good and comes out quickly. The staff is nice , but definitely do not go overboard to build a customer relationship that encourages a return of those who really enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip to AZ at the recommendation of the innkeepers at our B&B. Was not disappointed: service was great, food was delicious. Thai Rama doesn't \"western it up\" by adding copious amounts of grease and untraditional ingredients.  This was Thai spice and fresh flavor all the way.  Ambience is kitchy and charming. Would love to go back if we ever return to the southwest!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Thai food, but these guys do well.  Lots of choices and ingredients are clearly listed with the dishes - HUGE plus for a person like me who isn't very familiar with the cuisine.   Went in for a late lunch with a group and the service was excellent.  We lingered for a while and that wasn't a problem, particularly since the place wasn't very full at 3pm.  Server had no problems splitting the check up, which I find refreshing.    It's a little hard to find as it's in a shopping center you wouldn't really expect to have a restaurant - but it's worth sniffing out."}
{"text":"I use this place as my standard for all Thai Food restaurants. Sometimes its hard to get them to answer the phone if you are ordering for pick up, but the food is outstanding. I'm never disappointed in the quality of our meals. I prefer the Panang Curry. Ours kids like this place for their chicken strips and fries."}
{"text":"Great food..great service! Been here several times for both dinner and lunch specials. Convenient call ahead drive thru too! Clean and nice and cool inside :) Closed from 3-5 p.m."}
{"text":"Just ate there tonight because I didn't want to drive up to Thai House at Shea & Scottsdale.  The curry was brothy, the sauce with the chicken and broccoli was brothy...completely disappointed and won't be back.  Next time, we're making the 20-minute drive."}
{"text":"The food is always really good.  Come early for a table as lunch is popular and busy."}
{"text":"Red curry lunch special was supposed to have chicken in it. There were two tiny pieces of chicken, 3 green beans and an over abundance of bamboo. When I asked why there was hardly any chicken, I was told they count 6 pieces in each bowl... This was not the case for me and I was told they will not give me anymore. Needless to say, I feel they handled the situation poorly."}
{"text":"Their Thai BBQ is the best I've had in the Phoenix area! If you go, you need to try it. Their lunch menu's priced reasonably, and the dishes are delicious. Highly recommend it if you're looking for genuine Thai food that isn't expensive"}
{"text":"I love this place! Especially for lunch. I have Thai Rama at least 1-2 times a month for lunch. I can call in my order and go through the drive-thru pick up lane and quickly get my meal. I've never had to wait and it's always fresh and ready. Along with your meal you also get chips, a eggroll with sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"I've been going here very regularly for six years. They make the best Tom Kha Gai soup in town. I get it pretty much every time. They used to put slivers of lime leaves in the sweet, rich panang curry which made it really good. Often now they leave them out- I think maybe the chef changed. I also enjoy the mussaman stew. Another recommendation would be the yahm pla meug (squid salad). I can't comment on the noodle dishes as I'm not really into those and haven't tried any. The thai iced tea is good. Prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"The number 18 tohm yan soup is the best around for soup and noodle lovers. Thai tea is great too, but it is powerful. Medium to hot spicy will make you sweat, they don't joke around when it comes to spicy here."}
{"text":"Everyone loved the food.  Thanks, Yelp.  You helped us out on this one."}
{"text":"Horrible Service, I went to pick up my orders and I ended waiting some time but no one came to attend me even after noticing me at the front door which is very awkward. So I called the restaurant number and told that I am waiting at front door only then people came to attend me. When I asked about that, I didn't get proper response instead they were rude. Actually I ordered some fish cakes and fried rice when I asked about whats there in my to go box I was told that it has fried rice and something in  thai which I didnt understand . When I asked is it fish cake the lady told you are the only one who ordered fried rice so its your order, then later I found out that they mentioned the thai name for the fish cake. But I feel its a rude behavior, not sure how they are still in the business. And food was not great especially fish cake was oily and had raw smell.  I will never step in there in future. There are lot of other better thai restaurants near by so avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good food, clean and great service every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday with my husband and toddler. We got seated right away and it was pretty busy. We sat for about 15 minutes before our waiter even came to take our drink order. We decided to order food at the same time. Our waiter never came to check up on us, drinks were never refilled, and we wanted to order additional food but decided against it because no ever showed up. When it was time to go (after waiting for 20mins after we were done with our food)- I had to flag down someone at the counter to ask for the bill. Our waiter walked by us multiple times but he never made eye contact and it was like he was speed walking so he could ignore us. We noticed another next to use who also waited forever to get his bill and when we got there he was already done with his food. The food was okay but I don't think the lack of service is worth going there."}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch break (only 30 minutes, not such a good idea!) I got the lunch special with the paht thai, and it was very good. The egg roll that came with it was also good. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had more time to eat it. This is definitely not the spot to grab a quick meal, not that it was exceptionally slow, but they cook the food to order so it takes a little while.  I will definitely try it again when I have more time."}
{"text":"i went here for lunch and i was very disappointed.  The food was very bland and was served on dirty plates.  The wait time was okay, but the waitress was very rude and wasn't very attentive. The food is decent priced but the food was not good. The tea also had a cigarette smoke after taste. The water was not clear (maybe from the lemons) but the water was tap and tasted  very bad."}
{"text":"As I prepare to graduate and depart from the city that I have called home for the past five years, I am reminded of the only thing that I will miss and the one thing that will keep me coming back to Tempe. No, not Mill Avenue, not even $10 all you can drink Bear's Den, and most certainly not the university; but the Massaman Curry at Thai Rama located on University across from Raising Canes. By far the best Thai food of any location I have ever eaten at. If you have yet to eat here you are doing yourself an injustice."}
{"text":"I love the other locations of Thai Rama and this one is no exception! Food is fast, fresh tasting and well seasoned. The lunch specials are unique and delicious, and the service is good. Far superior to the Char's Thai restaurant that used to be in the same location."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from this place. Initially had a good experience although we ordered take-out. Second time we ordered delivery and my Path Thai had exactly ONE (1) shrimp in it. Buyer beware indeed!!! Will try dining in next time before dismissing the place altogether."}
{"text":"I decided to take a friend one night out for dinner. I was recommended to come here by someone, can't remember. When I do I'll make sure to punch them in the gut. My friend who is from Mexico and handles spicy like no big deal, ordered a spicy seafood soup. Within no time at all it looked as if he was bawling into his sulfur concoction. Between the spice and the temp of the soup, it was too much. Even just the steam from the food getting into his eyes seemed to be driving him mad. He was trying to take it like a man, but once someones nose starts to let go, uh yeah, WAITRESS! I call her over and try to explain the situation. She gives me a slight, polite smile and walks away with the sopa de sulfur. Brings back the soup this time not so red, like they quickly ran it under the sink to dilute the spice. Still my friend found it too spicy, and I call her over again. She says nothing, with the same smile goes into the kitchen and now yelling is coming from where she went into. At this point my friend is pretty uncomfortable and we ask a random worker if we can just order another dish. Some lady about 3 feet tall with a biker attitude comes out and starts yelling at me for returning her dish. It's like nobody understood from the beginning that it was too spicy and hot. I got more of an idea that maybe they thought we didn't like the food. She then had the audacity to tell me that whatever I ordered next I would have to pay for as well. OH NO SHE  DI' INT!!! So, the point of the story? Unless you're up for a Tuesday Night cat fight , just order out."}
{"text":"On the plus side, they actually make it properly spicy.  On the negative side, the food just isn't that good."}
{"text":"Written by my wife, Jenny Martin:  At first glance, Thai Rama is a low-key establishment that has been able to pack the place on Friday night. Although the atmosphere is less than stylish by any standards, the yummy scent of Thai spices is inviting. My husband enjoyed a Thai beer, Sing-ha. I stepped out of my box and tried a Thai iced tea, which is a Thai blend of spiced tea with cream. Let's just say it wasn't \"my cup of tea\" but I'm sure it would be good to someone else! The menu is comprehensive, but was missing one of my favorite starters-a simple salad with Thai peanut dressing. We opted for the Thai egg rolls on the menu. They were mediocre at best, as I usually enjoy a lighter spring roll type at Thai restaurants. I almost always chose a Pad Thai on date nights at Thai restaurants, but tonight I chose to enjoy a Shrimp and Pineapple Curry dish. When the server asked how I wanted it prepared, I said \"very mild.\" I will admit I have an extreme sensitivity to anything spicy-strange that I like Thai food at all, I know. Usually, the words \"very mild\" have my dish arrive at the table to my liking. Apparently, Thai Rama likes to kick things up a notch. My mouth was on fire! Overall, I would have to say I have had better. The sauce was very watery and not very flavorful, except for the spice. The shrimp was definitely very good. The yasmin rice was outstanding-sticky but not too sticky. My husband ordered a chicken curry. He was surprised to find that it came with shredded chicken as opposed to chunks. Because he said the word \"spicy\" when ordering, his was SPICY to the max! He did enjoy his dish, although wished there was more of a soup-like consistency rather than the small amount of sauce base. As much as we love Thai food, we concluded that there are better places in the Valley for our favorite traditional dishes. The service was great, everyone was nice. Maybe we are just too picky!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Thai food, so obviously I love this place:P Even out Thai foreign exchange student said it passed the test! Definitely go for the \"scary\" noodles.  Oh, and the servers are always nice:)"}
{"text":"My very favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The staff is amazing, a family run joint.  Get the Panang curry, drunken noodle, and a wonton soup.  Oh! and the eggplant is amazing!  Just get one of everything...."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Thai food take out. Staff is nice, curry's are delish, and portion size is good. Usually my red chicken curry is about 12$ here and be careful with the heat, medium got me sweating last time!"}
{"text":"I went in to order some take out and won't be back. Nobody greeted me. When I read the small sign that said to order at the register in the back, I stood there for three minutes while two members of the staff awkwardly looked at each other neither of them even acknowledging me.  I will not be back. Service and staff don't know what customer service is."}
{"text":"Much different experience than some of the recent reviews. Stopped in for dinner. Cuban joint down the street was closed. Started off with Angel Wings. It is deep fried stuff chicken wing with sweet chili sauce. Never had them before. Quite tasty. Three of them was too much for the two of us. Next moved on to soup. We went for the Gai Tohm Kahn. Sweet and sour chicken soup with coconut. Turned out to be pretty spicy. Good for me, I like spicy food. Finished off our dinner with Rad Nahn with chicken. Big,fat rice noodles with gravy. Not spicy, but still good.  The service was good, the prices were reasonable, and the food was tasty. Would return."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Service is also goodfood os spicy and can sometimes make your mouth burn, but depends on the spice level you order. Ambience is calm. The people serving are really good."}
{"text":"This place is great and has fantastic food- #23 is legit.  Service and food is constantly exceptional.  This place is a staple and I'm happy it reopened."}
{"text":"The service was great,  unfortunately my meal was too hot (ordered it medium which is usually fine), they took it back and the first few bites were amazing, then the heat crept back in... great flavor....."}
{"text":"Ordered to go to eat at my work desk. Delicious red curry and tom kha gai soup. Lots of chicken in both. I ordered mine extra hot. I didn't notice the heat, but I was sweating! I noticed they have FIVE levels of Thai hot after extra hot! I've had Thai hot before at other places and that's pretty much the limit for me. I knew the coconut milk would mellow things out and I wanted SOME heat, so extra hot it was. My order was up in less than 10 minutes. Why isn't this a 5 star? The tom kha gai soup wasn't delicious ENOUGH (I won't say who I'm comparing to) and the portion of the curry could've been a little larger but for the lunch special (you get a roll and wontons too) it was adequate. Oh and I'm taking home some of the soup.  Did you think I could eat all that?!"}
{"text":"I agree w/ Heather, the Evil Jungle Princess is a great dish.  My daughter gets it w/ the noodles, I get it with the rice.  Facility seems cleaner than the norm for most of the Asian restaurants in my area.  For dessert I like the fried bananas or Angel Sweet gelato (which is on the opposite corner)."}
{"text":"This place is good... great food, fresh .  Always my pick if I am in the area and craving Thai food.  Typical Asia restaurant, casual, quiet... love the food."}
{"text":"I have ordered only peanut curry here, and it's pretty good! I like it with boiled tofu and no peppers.   The best part is that you place the order over the phone and you can pick it up in the drive through!   Great place for take out. The dine in is not my fav, but it's ok."}
{"text":"After moving out of a city where you pretty much trip over a Thai restaurant on every other corner, I was craving some good Thai. A few friends suggested this place, and so we headed over there.   Thai Rama is a pretty casual joint - it seems like it used to be a Sizzler or something else in a previous incarnation. But the food is pretty good, and when I told them to make my dish spicy they actually listened and complied, so they get props for that. Good-sized portions as well, so you're getting your money's worth. The atmosphere may not be as nice as some other That restaurants, but the place is still clean and in the end, it's all about the food, right? It also seems like a popular place for local folks to order their food to go.  I'm hoping the 3 stars are accurate and that my standards for Asian food haven't started slipping since I moved to Phoenix. But I'd say it's a very safe bet, if not a good one, for you to get your satay on."}
{"text":"My family stopped by after driving all over town for errands (from Phx to Mesa to Tempe and you get the idea). We were all pretty grouchy and hungry before we spotted this Thai place, and my mom and I immediately had to to there. Being a Thursday night, it was really quiet. The place was clean, calm, and wow-- the food came quickly! Everyone loved what they had.   Pros: Fast service, incredibly friendly wait staff~, tvs (if that's your thing), lovely atmosphere, tasty food, good serving sizes for entrees (my mom and sister's also came with a big bowl of rice; mine didn't but I got more food in return), clean and quiet.  Cons: I've had spicier food. My mom ordered the spiciest available, and it was about my taste. I ordered medium and had to add chili powder myself to make it to my desired taste.  Overall, a good place to stop and eat while in the area. :)"}
{"text":"Never been to Thailand, but I can taste how authentic it is. Do the chicken stir fry with peanut dipping sauce, do the Thai tea with cream, watch out cause its sweet, I personally love the yellow curry with carrots and potatoes and I do hot, but its pretty much super spicy, so careful.  Very nice experience, not too pricey and if your one of the those lucky people who don't work 9-5's M-F, do their lunch special, you get hot tea, a cup of soup, a lunch meal which comes with rice, a fried spring roll and crunchy wontons."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food.  I have been here about 10-15 times and have lived in the area for 6 years or so.  Search Thai Rama as a separate words and there is another page on yelp with 53 reviews.  Food is very good and not too saucy like many other local places that people put 4 or 5 stars.  Prices are good and food is great.  service is normal (but who cares if food is good, get off your high horse)  conclusion- If you want great thai food go here,  If you want Americanized saucy, Panda express style thai food then probably not your best choice."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and won't go back anymore. The first time was a year and half ago and was great- good food and service.   The second time was about 10 months ago and the food was good but the service was not. I ordered a lunch menu item (at lunch time) and was brought the dinner portion. I mentioned to waitress that I was holding the lunch menu while ordering the lunch item and I was confused how the mix up happened. She said there was nothing she could do and I would be charged the dinner price. Not only charged the dinner price, but would not be getting the egg roll which came with the lunch item I ordered. She said she would bring an egg roll. Sure enough she charged for it on the bill. Not impressed. I shouldn't have to pay for a mistake that wasn't mine. But I did anyway and left.  I went for the third time a month ago and decided to skip any possible service mishaps and get take-out. The food was BAD. Not just mine, my husband's also.   Poor service and now poor food means we won't be going back."}
{"text":"There is always an interesting assortment of people in this place. Perhaps being close to Camelback and sort of close to Central it attracts a varied crowd. Everything from yoga instructors to military to foreigners to Texans. It is fun to people watch here.   I'm giving Thai Rama 4 stars based on their lunch specials. However I might lower it a bit for dinner. Thai Rama in Chandler is better. Touch of Thai in Glendale is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area.   #3 is good. Yellow curry with potatoes, carrots, chicken and coconut based curry stew. Is #3 in Thai restaurant the universal code for this dish? It seems every restaurant I have been to has #3 listed as Yellow Curry. We always ask them to leave out the onions here.  If you don't be prepared with an aresenal of Altoid mints - especially if you are heading to work after lunch! They put a whole onion in the dish - it seems like it anyway.  The Pad Thai is good with chicken and shrimp. The lunch special version of Pad Thai is just under $10 however it doesn't come with the yummy crispy eggroll and crunchy goods on the side like the sister restaurant in Chandler. However the portion of Pad Thai is huge and flavorful. I boxed up the other half and ate it the next day.  The glass noodles with chicken was okay however had a bit too much fish sauce. Eggrolls are good and taste fresh and appear to be made to order.   The service is okay. Watching the patrons and the train passing is better."}
{"text":"I'm picky.  I'm real picky about Thai. This place is clean, has a good menu, dares to prepare spicy curry that has depth and taste. Has a great staff and the ambience and vibe is relaxing.  Just plain good"}
{"text":"Very good place for thai food. I had the pad thai noodles with chicken and it very good. Will definitely by back."}
{"text":"This place was a second choice because we couldn't find the four starred thai basil. Either it was relocated or went out of business.    Thai lunch specials are good ranging from $6 to $11. I got the #6 hot! When it came out I got a veggie egg roll and some wonton chips. The spiciness wasn't that spicy and what disappointed was the fact that they gave me only one scoop of rice with hella food! Not Asian of them to pull that move off. Perhaps the clientele is mainly diverse and they tend to not eat all of their rice. I wish there was more though on my plate. Overall this joint was pretty good for pricing. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT THAI FOOD. period. atmosphere is very soothing."}
{"text":"Wow. Spotted a Thai place this morning and was craving Thai food ever since. Spotted this on way to an appointment and must say it was the worst Thai food ever. The \"mild\" Paht Thai is either spicy or sweetened to the point it is caramelized. Skip!"}
{"text":"Service is suspect but hang in there its worth the wait. Had the Moo Daeng and daeng it was tasty! Started with the Goyosa potstickers and a thai iced tea. Got there at 7:45 and there was another rush of folks around 8:15, crazy! on a Tuesday too! Maybe its all the homes in the area getting hail damage insurance to upgrade their homes. We sure took advantage. Great prices too. Eat it up!"}
{"text":"This place is dead to me.    I've been going here for years and used to be a regular for lunch.  The service went way town hill a couple of years ago so I stopped going as often but would occasionally go if I didn't have afternoon meetings.  Not anymore.  The service just isn't slow it's terrible.  I walked out after 20 minutes of no service today, the place was only half full and one of the waitresses was prioritizing bussing a table instead of taking care of guests.    Too bad, the food is actually decent."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant twice and I really like the place. The atmosphere is nice. The lunch menu, prices, and portions are reasonable. What I like the most about their lunch is that the it has a soup and egg roll included with the entree and rice. Love the Thai tea! A must try."}
{"text":"Yes!! Just grabbed some din din here tonight.  Thai iced tea was like a creamy milkshake, the soup (coconut milk, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, mushrooms, and extra veggies instead of chicken) is my fave! (#18 I think).  The service can be a little slow at times, but it really doesn't change how I feel about them.  Everyone is always nice and friendly and I have never had bad or so-so food here.  Get it!"}
{"text":"I had the red curry, which was a bit weak on flavor. I didn't really think it had much taste. There were only a few green beans in there with some chicken and lots of bamboo shoots. I think people who like bamboo shoots and not much flavor would like this dish. The red curry came in a little bowl on a plate with rice, a small eggroll, wonton chips, and a dipping sauce. I thought that the dish was a bit small compared to other Thai restaurants I have been to. Since I went during lunchtime, it also included a small bowl of soup at the beginning. The soup was very salty and flavorful. I think the soup was mostly a strong chicken broth with a garlic flavor and it had some rice in it. I also had some of the pad sew-ew, which was strong in flavor, which I liked, but it seemed a bit greasier than expected.  The overall vibe leans toward Americanized Thai food rather than authentic Thai."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by this place and it really wasn't the food as it was the service.  I saw how it had some really great reviews and living right nearby I thought to try it out.  My boyfriend and I went on a Friday evening and that was perhaps a poor decision on our end.  We got there and were the second group in line waiting for the hostess to come to the front.  After a few minutes we were seated and then there was a lot of waiting around.  There was quite a bit of people there for dinner and it appeared only two people working the floor.  They also seemed to be going to the kitchen for quite some time, perhaps they were helping out there too.  Once we did get our food, I did enjoy it and there was a lot of it!    I'm willing to give it another try, but perhaps during their lunch hour or for dinner during the week.  I really don't think we'll be there again for a weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Decadent thai food in perhaps too substantial portions at an affordable price in an ultra convenient location. Dine in the off hours and you may even have the restaurant all to yourself."}
{"text":"We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid.   When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!  If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!  Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO."}
{"text":"Solid Thai food from very friendly employees.  The won ton soup is good, especially with just a hint of the spicy chili powder condiment they can provide.  The presentation in a flaming donut cauldron (not sure what the correct name is, and too lazy to ask the Internet) is cool, and the soup stays nice and hot.  I like to get a side of rice for my soup too.  The crispy won ton appetizer is also good, but I've managed to avoid the temptation of ordering other delicious sounding items (like the $12 shrimp tempura special I almost fell for today), since I knew I'd have leftovers from my soup once it was bulked up with rice.  They've had a full remodel since the car crashed into their restaurant.  The flooring is kind of ugly (it's that industrial-looking gray tile that Costco sells), and the wall decor is meh, but I like the tables and booths.  Dinging them one star for the obnoxious 3% credit card processing fee they're passing on to their customers.  At least my card gave me back 2% of the bill as cash back.  The tiny parking lot can also get crowded.  Note that their menu is markedly different from the Thai Rama in Chandler.  In addition, they have not cheaped out and are still using quality cloth napkins."}
{"text":"Waffling between three and four stars.  I am going to go with three since they've been cutting costs by doing things like switching from cloth to fancy paper to cheap paper napkins over the years.  Yes, customers notice.  Don't order the crab fried rice - it has shells in it.  The chicken and tofu fried rice choices were fine though.  The won ton appetizer is very tasty and usually  not too oily.  My usual order is the chicken noodle soup, which usually has some nice pieces of chicken (though they seem to be using more \"scraggly\" cheaper and thus tougher cuts lately).  Be warned that different chefs/cooks seem to have different ideas of what \"mild\" means.  Some will not spice it at all, while sometimes it will have a touch too little or just enough heat.  My solution is to ask for the spice tray.  I use the red chili powder mix in particular, but only add a little at a time or you'll add not heat than you want.  Blame it on being from Hawaii, but I also enjoy ordering a side of white rice and using that to supplement the noodles in the soup.  The service isn't bad, though sometimes they get slammed and the few servers working cannot seem to keep up.  My family enjoys it here, so I am sure I'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"Ninny...Pad Thai!  Also, the server was awesome! Very rare you get great service now-a-days...he was awesome!"}
{"text":"After driving past this restaurant 5 days a week to and from school and noticing it always had a full lot, I decided to stop and get dinner.  I went with 2 dishes I have gotten often at other places, phad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and panang curry with beef.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the service was quick and friendly.  I will definitely be making this a place to stop at often."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The dish with the silver noodles is amazing. My favorite Thai in the valley by far."}
{"text":"The food was ok... wasn't very special.  My wife asked for \"Thai Hot\" ... got maybe a medium.  I asked for \"Medium Spice\" and got hot.   The service is still horrible.  I moved out of state for 2 years and during that time, the service didn't get any better.  I had to get up and ask for my check because the waitress was busy talking to a co-worker."}
{"text":"The Seafood soup combo is always a good pick this place is clean nice and the staff is friendly and attentive. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I recently called in an order for takeout.  When I arrived basically every table was full (it was a Saturday night).  While I was waiting for my food a server offered me water which I gladly accepted.  They were quite busy but seemed to crank out my order relatively fast (took a total of about 30 mins from when I called).    Their yellow curry and cashew chicken are delicious!!  The 'medium' is spicier than average, which in my opinion is not a bad thing.  Rice was quality and perfectly cooked.  I also had the chicken skewers with peanut sauce.  The sauce was awesome, though the chicken was slightly overdone but it really didn't bother me because the meal overall was fantastic.    I recommend this place and will be going back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Thai Rama for at least two years.  They are consistently good, and while they might not know me by name, they certainly know me by order.    We normally do take-out and have only eaten in the restaurant a handful of times.  Those times, the waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  We have a standard order (egg rolls, fried rice, paht see-iw, silver noodles) and then add in an entree or two - the kai yang, the steak thing, the garlic chicken, ginger chicken, the veggie stir fry...  The only food complaint I have is that their curry base is made too spicy for me to have.  I've got a total kitten mouth (and tummy!) and can't deal with any spice.  They cut their spice level, it seems, with additional coconut milk, but they can only cut it so far.  Additionally, I eat wheat-free (which most people parse as gluten-free).  I'm not amazingly sensitive, so I can handle the amount of wheat/gluten in the soy sauce, but for the most part, that seems to be it as far as wheat goes.  Some day when I go in to the restaurant, I'll have to have a chat with someone and see what the real low-down is, but for now, it's quite acceptable.  For a time, we went once a week, for about three or four months.  Each time, it was great.  Some weeks are better than others (haven't been able to pin down why yet), but it's never been anything less than good."}
{"text":"Great food and LOVE that they have drive through! I am gluten free and their yellow curry has never bothered me. The curry does have about 50% onions, so I ask for the curry without it."}
{"text":"Poor service, don't show up thirsty...refills are hard to come by..rice was old and cold...was giving this place a second chance today and they failed miserably"}
{"text":"Went here a while back with a group of friends for dinner (they didn't want to go to where I wanted to/usually go to).  Service was scarce, to be honest. The food was OK, but I've honestly experienced better in the Valley.  However, I do have issue with being charged a 3% \"convenience fee\" to pay by credit card.  Seriously?  This is 2016 folks, most people don't use cash anymore.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Thai restaurant. It's not the most authentic, and the wait staff seems a bit unsure of themselves, but it's still pretty damn good for what it is. I've been here a few times with my husband (he is super picky but really enjoys this place), and will definitely be returning as long as I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, great service, reasonable prices, lively atmosphere. Just don't be in a hurry here ;)"}
{"text":"Used to eat at Thai Rama back in the 1990's and always enjoyed the food. Then at some point in the mid 2000's they changed ownership or management;and for a while the food was so so.  I had not eaten their in many years. On New Years eve mysel and 2 friends decieded to give Thai Rama a try we were all very pleased the food was delicious and the portions were sufficent. With that experience, we have been back to Thai Rama several tmes. And its been consistently good. Wait staff is attentive, the seating and atmosphere is fine.   There's two things I've noticed since we started going to Thai Rama that could change and then it would be close to 5 stars. More vegetarian options., they do have a small section of vegetarian choices. Which is nice,being I'm vegetarian I'm always happy to see more vegetarian selections. And consistency with portions. Seems if you order two plates they make one of the orders normal portion size and the second order much smaller portion size. I've noticed this with consistency each and every time.  I don't understand why they do this. Perhaps I can chock it up to the fact that the waits staff are all very thin. So they are making your second dish small in order to enforce the Jenny Craig portion control on you. Ik really don't know. However when your payinf full price for the meal it should not make a dikfference even if its you 2nd 3rd or 4th dish. Portion size should be the same all the way around. Another thought I had was if your overweight which iam they short you on the portion size. The reason I say that is because my friends that have return with me to Thai Rama every time; their portions seem to be a reasonably good portion size. Not at all the smaller portion size I seem to be getting. Bla bla bla bla. I know I gone on for quite a bit about portion size..I'm going to try not to make this a contencious issueas it seems to be. Any suggestions as to hw to address some thing like this when your dinning at a restaurant you enjoy?  So if it weren't for the issues I've disscused I would definatley give Thai Rama 5 stars I will return delicious food, attentive wait staff. And reasonalbe prices.  (Don't forget they offer brown rice) ++"}
{"text":"Great food . Be prepared to wait for a little while though. Friendly staff, they are just slow when it's busy."}
{"text":"I got the pad see ew and loved the food. I went with my friend on a pretty packed lunch and got in and out quickly. Food was amazing and excellent service."}
{"text":"The Gai Graprao lunch special is incredibly fresh and delicious. A stir fry medley of well seasoned chicken, bamboo shoots, sweet basil, onions, and chili peppers that keeps you reaching for your fork wanting more. I ordered it with medium heat and it was spot on. Just enough kick that no additional spice is needed, yet not enough to obscure its succulence. The chicken can be substituted with fried tofu. All lunch specials include steamed rice, won ton chips, soup, and an egg roll. As I recall, all were under $7, a real bargain. The service was fast, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Thai Rama has some of the best Thai food in town. We stopped by on a Saturday night and had the Yellow Chicken Curry, Spicy Fried Rice and Pad Thai (all medium hot). There was a ton of flavor in every dish and the portion sizes were great. I believe it was the owner that was serving us and she couldn't have been nicer or more tentative. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I like coming here because the lunch specials are great and filling and they are consistant.   Try an order of peanut sauce with the pad thai. Great combo! Love the soups"}
{"text":"Amazing. I have been going here for years. The best Thai food in the valley. Amazingly friendly service and they always get it right. If you're looking for fresh Thai food you've found the right spot."}
{"text":"I am a Thai food addict and I love Thai Rama. The food is great but the service is often not the best. Let me be clear it's not horrible but it's not great either. The food portions are large, the prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. However when you walk in the door it takes some time to get the attention of someone to seat you. When I ask for extra sweet and sour it often never comes and when I can get the attention of a waiter I have to remind them and even then they take their time.   Given that I still come her regularly to eat and love their food. Parking is easy as well. It sits right on Camelback near the light rail which is also convenient. You must try their food!"}
{"text":"The food is just okay. Portions sizes tend to be large. Service is poor but they're friendly. It's never too crowded in there and the inside has nice scenery."}
{"text":"Sad to say but this place's food quality has gone down considerably well since I first started coming here. Very dry :( I dont think I will be going back. Such a shame :("}
{"text":"This place has very good thai food with a bunch of stuff I haven't seen at other places.  Probably my second favorite down here in Chandler.  The Evil Jungle Noodles are one of the best thai dishes I have ever had.  It is a thai noodle dish with a spicy coconut milk/ Curry sauce. It is pretty difficult to eat since they come in a very compact bowl that seems to hold them steaming and hot for a very long time.  I highly recommend them and hopefully you are less sloppy than me when eating noodles.  They also have a very good Pad See Ew which is my usual goto for thai food.  I always get medium and it's got a fairly good kick. The Evil Jungle noodles seem much spicier, but that could be related to the temperature of being very hot and stays that way.  The tables and booths are a bit worn, and it takes a bit to get your check, but that's not really a deal breaker for me as the food and is very good and the staff has been very nice on my visits.  Try: - Evil Jungle Noodle - Pad See Ew - Salad Rolls"}
{"text":"Great lunch value and a really good pad thai. Only caution make sure to order mild their medium is still pretty hot. Can't beat their lunch menu soup, a good sized dish, and a spring roll for around $8.   Perhaps not an impressive atmosphere for a date, but for lunch near campus or just to have some good thai food I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried Thai Rama in Chandler for the 1st time.( Chandler Blvd/ Dobson.) The place is small, clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. I'm not very familiar with Thai food, but was feeling adventurous and was craving spicy... I asked the friendly Thai waitress for some suggestions and she explained that you can order most of the entree items with your choice of meat or seafood, or even tofu as your protein choice.  Plus you can order with different degrees of spicy and they have chili sauce, and red chile powder and jalape√±os on the side, to \"add heat\".  I started with a  spicy grated papaya salad...EXCELLENT! Also try the Thai Jasmine tea. Nice subtle flavors.  After a few questions and the suggestion of my server, I also tried a wonderful curry dish called \"Evil Jungle Princess\". A creamy, red curry dish with veggies, served with rice (also available with noodles) and I chose tofu as the protein. I ordered \"Med hot\" and that was just fine , because I added the red chile powder to heat it UP to my desired level. (hint: You can't really tone it down if you order it too spicy, but you can always add more spice , if it's not)....The Evil Princess was absolutely delish! Anything BUT evil! I am still thinking about this sweet princess!  It was a very quiet night and the service was a little slow, but I was in no hurry.  The food was prepared fresh to order. and I really enjoyed the new dining experience. This locale has a drive up window for  phoned in to-go orders and I understand they do a booming biz for lunch. I WILL be back and I am bringing people with me! I think a big party could order different items from their vast menu, and everyone could try a little bit of this, a little bit of that....I loved this place and I encourage you to try it!"}
{"text":"We came here on New Year's Day! It was a great way to start 2018! The staff are very friendly & the restaurant is clean. It was also calm & not too loud which matters when you have an infant trying to sleep  I got a shrimp & vegetable dish which was seasoned perfectly! & of course I had to end with some sweet sticky rice with mango! I highly recommend them for your Thai food craving!"}
{"text":"Great food,dull environment and adorable waitresses. I enjoy going and the food is great. I wish they would update the decorations, but were in recession and I understand. The food is delicious and I continue eating there. I enjoy supporting this local businesses."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple time and I never like the male cashier. It feels like I was there asking for free food and they are so annoyed taking my orders. I usually order around $50 worth of take out and I should spend that at another place. However, Thai ice tea and beef salad is good."}
{"text":"Been going here on a weekly basis for the past year, enjoyed the food a lot but the customer service is definitely lacking. Just recently they messed up two of our to go orders in a row and then blamed is for them not understanding is correctly and not to mention someone with a very thick hard to understand accent should not be taking phone orders. The next order I found burnt or charred pieces of something in my sound and my boyfriend found shrimp shells in his chicken noodle dish. It seems like they were careless in making out food in most likely dirty pans and things were definitely cross contaminated. Getting a refund was a huge hassle! We haven't been back since. The though of it still makes me feel sick!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food!  Lunch time is worst time to go. Try to be there between 11a and 11:30a or after 1p. The wait staff are pretty busy but the food is worth the wait.  The restaurant is tidy and clean. There was no food observed on the floor. It tends to get loud when there's more than 15 people eating. The acoustics weren't meant for a sit down restaurant as you will notice with their drive-thru.  Pricing is very reasonable for lunch. The portions are very big. Tofu was easily substituted for the chicken on the Pakh Thai.  Lunch for two of us with a soda came to around $15. Remember to ask for extra napkins should you order your plate Hot or above."}
{"text":"I love this place, each time I try something new I've found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"My husband & I absolutely love Thai food, and coming from the Los Angeles area, we have been very spoiled.  We had not found a great Thai restaurant until we came here last weekend.  Just the right spiciness to all our favorite dishes.  Their shrimp.vegetable tempura was so light & delicious...and their homemade sweet & sour sauce is amazing...I wanted to lick the little dish clean!  Excellent service and moderate prices.  Restaurant may need some updating but the food is amazing!  We def will be back...wish it was closer for us to get take out!!"}
{"text":"Thai Rama is my favorite Thai place in Phoenix. Each of their dishes has great flavor! I love the Phat Woon Sen and order it medium for a good level of spice!!"}
{"text":"I signed up on Yelp just to write this review. This place offers extremely bad service. On their website, we found  that they offer lunch special upto 3 pm on weekdays. So we went there at 2.35 pm. This extremely rude lady(probably the owner) told us that lunch special was only till 2.30 pm and gave us the dinner menus. She was not even close to polite in dealing with the whole thing. Although the restaurant was almost empty she was rushing us to finish, she handed over the bill when we were still eating. We had asked for a single bill, but I guess she heard it wrong and got 3 separate split bills. And, when we handed her a single card for payment she started shouting at us saying that she had to swipe the card thrice! Now, whose mistake was it in the first place! This lady was extremely unreasonable, rude and does not have any people management skills. The food was okay types, not great. Please stay away from this place unless you don't mind bad service!"}
{"text":"Love Thai Rama, great place to eat. Decor could be much better, but food is incredible and worth it."}
{"text":"The service here is very attentive and friendly. Food is perfect in every way. If you are addicted to Thai food like I am, this place will make you happy. Then, you will realize that you can't live without it. Soon you will become a regular and have the menu memorized by heart and the cooks will wonder if you ever eat at home. It's OK. It's not your fault the food is so good.  With that being said, the wonton soup is to die for and I'm currently obsessed with their Pad See Ew. Come on, let's go already!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and a great spot for lunch. Despite the fact that know nothing about Thai food, I love hitting up Thai Rama for lunch when I'm in the area. I've tried many of the lunch specials and every one has been delicious. People who know more about the food can comment on the specifics - all I know is its delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was very nice and food was good. Phad Thai tasted good and the red curry was great as well. Reason why I only have 4 stars is because I was missing the carrots in the curry and it could have had a bit more chicken."}
{"text":"I have no idea what happened to this place but both the food and service has gone downhill in the past 6 months or so. Now I have come to expect slow service like no one checking on if you need drink refills and inconsistent spice levels like tonight where I got the tom kha and panang both mild but the soup was bland and the curry spicy. But the best part was getting ONE tiny piece of bell pepper in the panang. Really?!"}
{"text":"This is by far not only the best Thai Rama, but the best Thai place in the valley. Always have great service, they are consistent, and I've tried probably at least 15 different thai places.   The spicy noodles or the drunken noodles are to drool about!   Thankfully it isn't too close to home for me or I'd eat it several times a week.   Hard to find consistently great authentic food!  Phoenix FAV!"}
{"text":"Love the Tom Yom, Phat Kaprow and Panang Curry. I'm convinced they'd do a heck of a better take out business if their phone line wasn't jacked half the time!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in AZ!! This place has a drive thru to pick up your food!! This is so convenient when doing take out!  Friendly  owners and staff. You can customize dishes by meat (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu) and by spiciness. Favorites are:   -Paht Kee Mow with chicken noodle dish mixed with stir fry variety of sprouts, carrots, onion, and broccoli.  -red curry with chicken with bamboo shoots, broccoli and other veggies. -seasonal mango over sweet sticky rice and coconut milk to dress the whole thing for a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food around. Everything I've tried on the menu is amazing.  I've been to just about every Thai place in town and this is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch had the yellow chicken curry lunch special. I haven't been here in years but everything was just as I remembered, I ordered the curry medium and had just enough spice to start a light sweat and still taste flavorful.   The staff was hustling and everything came out fast despite being almost full.   Definitely worth the stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but I've had better. I found that their version of \"medium\" is more like \"hot/really hot\" to the average Thai place, so that kind of turned me off. Also, I found the spices/flavor quality to be average, but then again I've only had their curry and chicken satay."}
{"text":"The specialty steak dish was terrible. The steak was over salted and really tough. The rice that came out was the kind of rice that you have when you leave it in the rice cooker on warm for like 6 days. The service was good which is what saved one star."}
{"text":"Great Paht Thai! And I'm very picky about my paht thai. Also I loved the thai iced tea and the fact that they have lunch specials on the weekend that comes with soup and an egg roll. The tohm yahm soup was VERY delicious!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Thai place! It is always delicious. My husband loves their drunken noodles and I love their pad Thai or pad-see-yew. The have a drive through window for pick up orders you call in which is very convenient! I only wish that they delivered :)"}
{"text":"I don't think I can live without Thai Rama! As I said in my earlier review, the #18 soup is amazingly delicious! The #23 garlic chicken is probably my favorite dish! I've been ordering a different curry every time I go. The yellow curry with chicken is very good, the panang curry with beef was so good, the masaman curry is like Thai beef stew! We had the red curry with chicken once and while there was nothing wrong with it, I prefer the yellow and panang. I have yet to try the green curry."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special and spicy hot.  Most Thai food in the Phoenix area is never spicy enough, but this had the right amount.  I had the yellow curry with chicken which had great flavor.  The onion and carrots were sliced thin and cooked crisp-tender. I also ordered ice tea which had a great somewhat sweet flavor.  My only complaint was that the egg-roll was a bit over cooked.  The staff was attentive until they got slammed with a lunch rush.  There were only 2 servers, so I will cu them a break on that one"}
{"text":"I have been going to Thai Rama for several years. Up until a few months ago I would have given them a 5 star rating. Since I moved to Central Phoenix, I make special trips to this location though I have a Thai Rama closer to me. However lately I have noticed a shift in customer service. It seems to get worse every time I go in.   Last week was just strange. I went in for lunch after the lunch crowd had left. I placed my order and that went fine. However after that I saw no sign of the waitress or anyone for that matter. The servers were in the back kitchen talking and after I finished my meal (minus a refill on water and tea) I waited patiently for someone to come out to ask for my check.   And then I waited and waited and waited. Finally a young woman came out from the kitchen (not my waitress). I walked up to the register and asked for my ticket. She was incredibly rude. I handed her my credit card. She ran it and then tried to stuff my card and receipt into a receipt book and hand me that. I pulled it out since I still needed to sign it. I was thinking \"Why in the h*** is she putting this in a receipt book when I am standing right here?   Then I asked her for a to-go box. She stared at me blankly and then walked off. I had no idea what she was doing so I waited by the counter. She came out with a to-go box. I reached out for her to give it to me. Instead - she veered around me, walked all the way back to my table with me following her in utter confusion. Then she threw it on my table. It was to be one of the weirdest interactions I have ever had with wait staff.   Just then my original waitress came out of the kitchen and asked if I wanted to pay my bill!   While the food is still great, the customer service has really gone downhill in the last few months. Too bad - this place used to be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are Pad Thai enthusiasts - this place didn't measure up. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but what we received was bland and tasteless. The drive-thru pickup window was awfully convenient, though."}
{"text":"The papaya salad is fresh, I like it Thai hot #3, it is a party in my mouth. It reminds me to the food I tasted in Thailand."}
{"text":"This use to be one of our favorite places to eat. We placed an order for take out, when we got home and began to dish up our food the disappointment began to set in. The Thai Toast was more like French toast, the crab ragoon almost missed the filling, the entries where a big disappointment also. This is the second time we have really been disappointed. Don't know what has happened, one more try we will give it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here every time I'm in the valley. Food is a bit over priced, but the lunch menu is great if you're on a budget and wanting good food. Been coming here for the past two years and it has great consistency."}
{"text":"Best I've had. My fave is Mango delight it's delish. Always seem busy but that's just how good it is!"}
{"text":"I went to Tai Rama last night with friends absolutely Amazing.  I wish it was closer to my house but its definetely worth a Drive..."}
{"text":"This restaurant literally was a deciding factor when my husband and I purchased a house in the adjacent neighborhood. The staff are so friendly, and the food is so delicious. It's our favorite place. This location is completely separate from other Thai Ramas in the valley--way better than the one in Tempe. Try the angel wings and yellow curry!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch deals for 6.95! Every dish is tasty, service is fast, staff is friendly and you get a lot of food for your buck! My go to spot for authentic Thai. My favorite dish is the coconut curry."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, terrific food always the same service and always my favorite. Love the thai basil chicken. The staff are so great they remember what you like and how you order! Incredible service!"}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, Thai Rama delivers the basics. I wasn't blown away but I will be back for the convenient drive up take out option. Simply average Thai spot.   Busy at lunch, which is a good thing. Service was unorganized but courteous. Over all average."}
{"text":"Delicious, solid Thai food and the prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food you get.  We chose the following:  Tom Yum Gai - we ordered this soup in medium, but it still had a nice kick Chicken Fried Rice - moist and flavorful.  You can taste a hint of coconut milk Panang Beef - the red coconut curry was tasty and the beef was perfect Yellow Curry Chicken - scrumptious  Chicken Pad Thai - better than most that I've had"}
{"text":"The yellow curry here is unbelievable it is the perfect blend of spicy, sweet and fresh. If I could have this to eat every day I would be happy as a clam! Yes the service is slow, but you can't rush perfection!"}
{"text":"I used to come here for lunch and had never had a bad meal. So we decided to come for dinner.  It was bad, really bad. We ordered  potstickers. These were like the cheapest pre made potstickers you could buy at Samsclub. And they were cooked till they were limp and flavorless.   Then we got the Satay Chicken. Again something that started out frozen from a bag and cooked till it was rubbery and tasteless. Hands down the worst satay I have ever had.  Then I ordered a beef dish. Tough, chewy and stringy.  Not one of the 4 of us had anything we would ever say I'd eat that again.  For lunch I used to get the Shrimp Pad Thai. And I used to enjoy it. After a dinner like that though I'll never come back.  The service was good. That's it."}
{"text":"Still my favorite!!!!  AWESOME food.  Servers are super nice.  I go often enough that they already know what I want.  They have made it a community.  I love the Prigh King Tofu and Vegetables while I get the Prigh King with beef for my better half.  Sooooo goooooood!!!!  Everyone I have taken then pretty much enjoyed everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm with Shanna K on this one. I'm so addicted that I'm there almost once a week. No wait, I'm there EVERY week at least once!  I was never a big Thai food person, until I tried this place. Now I can stop eating their food.  Although I also have to agree with some of the other review that service can sufer during the lunch rush hour.  But worth the wait every time.   My usual?  the egg rolls to start, chicken curry to get the party started... and for dessert; the mango sticky rice, to cool things down.  aaaaah"}
{"text":"Love their food but they are really hit and miss on answering the telephone for pick up orders.  We have had to give up and just drive to re restaurant to order to go a few times too many."}
{"text":"Best authentic Thai food in the area and possibly in the city.   Recommend the chicken fried rice and Pad Thai. Service is great and take out is easy. Very reasonable prices on all of their dishes."}
{"text":"I have been here many times...but since last two times, the service I got was very bad...Quality of food is also not that great...I found couple of stones in food as well..the staff is very rude.... :("}
{"text":"Red Chicken Curry  Chicken Pad Thai  Pork Fried Rice  ..majorly delicious!.. and thank you for having the nice waitress who explained the spiciness levels. Well done."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, Thai Rama is very good.  My wife and I have eaten there a handful of times over the past few years, and I think -- at some point -- the kitchen staff / chef must've changed as the food was markedly better than what we had remembered.  (That's always a good sign.)  Occasionally, it's been very busy (Friday nights, early Saturday evening), but we've never had to wait for a table, and the service staff have always been friendly AND helpful in making recommendations.  While Thai Rama isn't our favorite Thai restaurant, it's still an appealing choice."}
{"text":"The food is some of the best Thai food I have ever had, but the service has gone downhill in the past 8 months.  Also, the last two times we have been there, we all got sick that evening.  Last time I was there, it took 10 minutes to take our drink order.  After the drinks arrived, it was 20 minutes before she took our actual order.  In the meantime, a stream of takeout people came in and left.  we were ignored for the take out crowd.  As much as I like the food here, I'm not willing to give up another weekend by being ill, so eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Glad that I found this place. I moved from California where there are a lot of good thai restaurant and I've been to many thai restaurant here in AZ and the food are suck. This restaurant is the best that I found compare to any other thai restaurant in the valley. Good service, good food and clean. Must try!"}
{"text":"You get 1 star for ignoring me at the door for over 5 minutes. For making eye contact several times and not even acknowledging me as a person, a customer. So I walked out and told you -.your rude b and that you could have said hello. You could have smiled and said I'll be right with you. Now you may think you don't need my $35 and you probably don't,  but keep doing what your doing and you won't have anymore customers left. It's ok because Charm Thai was happy to take my money and they were friendly and nice and their food was delicious.   There's too many options for Thai food in the valley these days. No drama Thai Rama."}
{"text":"Thai Rama was a good meal. The service was quick and polite and the restaurant was very quiet.  It was a relaxing time. We ordered the Thai Toast as the appetizer because it wasn't something we have ever heard of before. We really liked it. Hands down the best part of the meal. I ordered the shrimp pad thai. It was basic pad thai and certainly not bad, but not the best either. The husband's meal was nice and spicy like he wanted. He LOVES spicy and most Thai restaurants will baby you with what they call \"spicy\", They weren't as bad here as holding back and he was starting to sweat towards the end :) We aren't local so we wouldn't come back, but most Thai places by us do not deliver. If I was local, it would be great to have Thai Rama as a delivery place, but I don't think I'd be back for a night out."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've found since moving to AZ. My husband and I have gone here maybe 6 times and every time the service has been great... The servers are very fast and friendly. Everything I've ordered here has been fantastic and I highly recommend the satay. They also have a drive thru for take out which is super convenient."}
{"text":"This used to be the best Thai in town. Ordered out from their last night and the rice was hard and mushy at the same time. No flavor different ingredients. So salty it was barely edible. New ownership?"}
{"text":"Never disappointing. #23 is the best, and you won't regret getting a hot soup. Love Thai Rama."}
{"text":"We lived in the Thailand for years and this place is legit. Be warned: If you order the Thai Hot its as hot as it gets! This is not Americanized Thai, its the real thing!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Thai food.  I just know I love it and of all the places I've tried in the valley I like this place the best.  Great yellow curry and my wife and kids who like to keep it bland and simple can get the teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Whenever I have extra time at lunch, I cruise over to this place. I love the spicy coconut soup with added veggies or the peanut butter chicken. Service was great as well. I have no complaints about this places so i gave it a 4 star."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place ITS ALL MINE!!!  Just kidding. Check them out. Damn good Thai food here. I do think they give me medium when I order hot cuz I'm a white boy, but that's ok. I can take the heat. Bring it on. Hot Gratiam Prig Thai with Pork is my main event!!!"}
{"text":"Garlic stir fry with pork (medium or hot) is delicious. Comes with steamed white rice and that's all you really need. Get it to go and it comes in a bowl that you can dump the rice into and mix it all up. One tasty tasty dinner here my friends.  Friends have had the pad see ew with chicken and once with beef. Pretty tasty. A little sweeter than I personally would want it but the meat and noodles are cooked well.  Had the Thai Toast. Not a huge fan. But I have never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to. Just tasted a bit oily to me. Deep fried a bit too much."}
{"text":"My colleagues LOVE this place!  We seem to go once/week.  I am no Thai expert, but I have to admit, of those we have tried in the Chandler area, this is the BEST.  It's always packed, and that is the first sign of goodness!  For lunch, you get a lot of bang for the buck: soup, tea, wonton, and then the main meal.  Service is average, however...nothing special...but not slow.  I am not certain I would ever choose this restaurant for dinner because I am all about the atmosphere, but this is a great value, and anyway...I like to spend time with my colleagues outside of the office!"}
{"text":"Omg.... So yuuuummmie  Just moved to the state and I can't express how happy I am to have a Thai place so close to my home and have it be delicious. The staff is amazingly warm, I am always happily amazed when a restaurant has amazing service.  I have not one negative thing to say!"}
{"text":"Soooooo tasty. We ordered the yellow curry mild and it was perfect. We also ordered the Gai Tohm Khah (sweet and sour soup  with coconut milk, mint leaves, and mushrooms) it was so amazing and came out in a large metal propane serving dish ! Get that for an appetizer to share with the table.   Service was wonderful and the place is clean and cute."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING. I ate the Tohm yahm Gai soup and it was bursting with flavor beyond any I have previously had in LA, Palm Springs, or Phoenix.  I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Thai Rama restaurant has good pad thai!"}
{"text":"They have delicious food, every bite is packed with flavor. Personal favorites are the garlic and cashew chicken, but the curry is excellent as well.  The lunch special is from 12-3, and it's a great deal. I highly, highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoy the food, usually a packed place during lunch."}
{"text":"This place is very nice and food was amazing our waiter Adam was great all in all we had a very pleasant experience i recommend this place to every one"}
{"text":"Just moved in the area last night (was up moving allllll night up to 5am this morning) and was so excited to find a new Thai place near our house. We went through the drive-through since we placed our order over the phone which was super convenient. I ordered yellow curry with tofu and with tomatoes instead of carrots. When we got home I noticed the entire container was made up with mostly the onions (which are supposed to be supporting ingredient), only one or two pieces of tofu, and a tomato on the very bottom of the container. I put the food I poured out back in the container without eating it. Needless say, the last thing we wanted to do after such a long moving experience with just us two, was to have to leave the house again. I called the manager to let him know that there may have been some miscommunication and instead of offering some solution that didn't require us to leave the house yet again (we were thinking maybe a voucher for next time we come in), The manager was pretty apathetic.   My husband ended up leaving anyway to return the food and get his money refunded since now he had a pretty bad vibe about the way the manager was with me over the phone. Manager dumped the food on a plate in the drive though and ended up arguing that there were 4 pieces of tofu, not 1 (but I'm still pretty sure that it's Tofu yellow curry, not onion yellow curry. ) and then he corrected us and said there were two wedges of tomatoes, not one. Kept arguing longer and my husband just kept staring that it was not what we ordered/how we ordered and definitely not in line with their menu. SUCH a bummer since we LOOOVE supporting local business and wanted to make this a weekly visit.   Bummmmmer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places for sure. It's not fancy by any means but the food is amazing. Every time I go there the place is busy. But the kitchen keeps things moving. I've never had to wait for a table. Parking can be a squeeze at times ( I drive a Tahoe ) but that's a minor issue."}
{"text":"My favorite  Thai restaurant.  Service  can be a problem.  Every thing is great .add the fish sauce with Thai chili's if you like it hot . I like their bean thread noodles.  Red curry and off course phat thai. Best dish is their coconut  ice cream.  They do add a 3 %  credit card fee"}
{"text":"For the last few years this has been my favorite Thai food restaurant in the Phoenix area, but it is starting to slip. The food has been so good that to this point it has overcome the poor service. As much as it pains me to say, I am not sure how long that will be the case. I rate the food a 5, but the service a 1. My favorite dishes are the Pad Kee Moa, Evil Jungle Princess, and the Panang Curry. The food has great flavor, with just the right amount of spice. My wife's favorites are the yellow curry and the noodle soup with chicken. The owner and her staff are very nice, but the service is poor to say the least. It can take a very long time to get seated, even when they have many tables available. It can also take a while to get your order taken. Once you get your food, you many not see your server again until it is time to get the check. Overall they are not very attentive... but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai restaurant.  Staff is friendly.  I love their chicken and green beans in a red curry sauce. I also love their garlic shrimp.  The sauce is simply delicious.  I can get by just eating the gravy . I also like their silver noodles. The best  dish is their coconut ice cream.  Try it you will like it"}
{"text":"Just get better you keep coming for more love this place, server were friendly food are extremely fast nice open dining area space and ver nice.  Couple people said not really authentic  Thai food Really? What are really exactly authentic Thai food anyway? Speaking as Thai like me!,,, what I know is that they are pretty much using all the same ingredient as Thai food in Thailand,... Don't just assumre you are don't. Really know the fact.   They are only one Thai restaurant here is offer $ 1.00 draft beer in Happy Hour  and $ 2 cocktail what a deal. I'm so,, coming back ,.."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Thai Rama. I've been looking for another Thai place for a while, usually we go to Lemongrass. We were planning on staying in and having a movie night, so I called in a pickup order. The person who answered the phone had great phone etiquette, which is really important to me. He went out of his way to make sure that the order was perfect, he answered all of my questions and gave suggestions when I asked for them. After deciding upon the fresh rolls (he suggested the shrimp) and their Thai style eggplant dinner (which I requested to have made with steamed not pan fried tofu) and I substituted brown rice for white. They charge two dollars extra for brown rice, which seems like a little much for a rice upgrade, but it's not really that big of a deal.  I know that it's annoying to make substitutions to dishes, but he had no problem making the dishes exactly to my specific wishes, which is great.  They do charge two dollars extra for brown rice, which seems a little excessive for brown rice, but it's not really that big of a deal.  and was a nice detail. He told me the order would be ready in ten minutes! I thought that was amazing, I wasn't really enthused about the idea of having to wait around for a long time waiting for dinner.  I got to the restaurant in less than ten minutes, my order was ready early, which made me really happy. The restaurant was very clean, and while it wasn't busy, the patrons that were there really seemed to be enjoying themselves. The man I spoke with earlier made sure I had chopsticks, and even got me a water to go and he gave me more suggestions for next time. Their customer service is fantastic. I was really pleased.  When I got home I was almost expecting something to be wrong with my order since I had made a few substitutions/changes. Everything looked perfect. That earns Thai Rama big brownie points in my book. I unwrapped the first fresh roll, and bit into it, it was delicious, the rice paper was thinner than I'm used to which made the roll a much more enjoyable texture. They serve their fresh rolls with a peanut sauce, that is kind of textured and a bit thick, I prefer them with a ginger sauce, but that's a matter of preference. They didn't use as much mint or shrimp as I'd like, so next time, I'm probably going to get just veggie ones, they weren't worth paying two dollars more for two small shrimps per roll. There was actually a shrimp tail in the roll, not connected to a shrimp, just hanging out making the roll a little tricky to eat. It was the only disappointing part of the dinner. Their Thai Eggplant was great, it came with a lot of broth, which was a bit more of a soupy consistency than I'd liked, but again, that's a matter of preference. I ordered the Eggplant dish medium, and it was really spicy. More spicy than medium, but I love spicy food so I was still really happy with the dish. If you're not into spicy food I would suggest ordering everything mild.  Overall, I'm glad that I tried Thai Rama, I would probably go there again, but I think that my Thai tour is going to continue."}
{"text":"Amazing, I had a number 6 for lunch special and will be going there much more, even if it expands my waist.  Thank you"}
{"text":"So.  Good.  Normally at a Thai restaurant I go for Pad Thai, but we wanted to try something a little different.  I had the Massuman Curry, which was good but less spicy than I expected. My wife had the Yellow Curry, which was spicier than she expected.  I got dinner envy and had half of hers - it was GREAT!!  The desserts were also great - we had the coconut ice cream (homemade) and fried bananas with honey.  The people were helpful and friendly, and while the ambience wasn't necessarily elegant I liked it.  Definitely going there again!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Busy lunch place with good food. We had beef Panang and Pad Thai. Both were really good."}
{"text":"Thai Rama has exceptional food.The service is amazing as well. You definitely can not judge a book by its cover with this place. The inside is gorgeous and has real Thai food. I ordered the won ton soup and it came in a dish that had flames coming out of the top. It was overall an amazing experience and I look forward to going back very soon! No complaints here. I would recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"The people there were very nice but my food was cold and the Pad Thai was nothing but noodles, had very few vegetables and was kind of bland."}
{"text":"Well this place has been here for as long as I can remember. At least 20 years. They used to be wonderful! One of the best places to go.  But, they sold and changed staff but, kept the name. I do not know why. Anyway, it went down hill very quickly. The new owners did not seem to get the concept of why this place was so popular. They do close for an entire month in the summer while the family goes back to Thai Land for holiday.  They were so bad for awhile I vowed never to go back. But since my girl lives over in that part of town I would cave and we would go. It is just like a lot of the other patrons have written. It is so hit and miss.  One day the food is great and the next time you go it is horrible.  The lunch specials are good. But the last 4 times I have gone they never have the soup. Do not advertise soup if you really do not have it.  Parking is tight so sometimes you have to park on the street."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I always carry out so I can't speak to the service but the food is great!  Very reasonably priced and good sized portions.  I can't find any good Chinese in this town but this place covers that need.  Definitely check it out...."}
{"text":"This place has the worst owner she is so rude. The food is not that good. The service sucks."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai restaurant!  I love their vegetable/cabbage soup. I've had it when I was battling a sinus infection and I felt great after I had it.  I've also had it when I've felt fine and it's the best!   I love their pork with garlic sauce- I don't usually eat pork as much as I prefer chicken or beef, but it tastes best with pork in my opinion, and the sauce is heavenly.   If you like crab, they have a really good crab fried rice, it's not the imitation crab either! It's the real deal.   Prices are comparable to many other Thai restaurants I've been to. No complaints!"}
{"text":"except for the pad thai and chicken satay, the food is very good. the chicken in the satay was gristly and tough. The service was very good. They must have seen the bad service reviews and gotten their act together."}
{"text":"I am currently on the hunt for a great go-to Thai food take-out joint in Tempe. Unfortunately Thai Rama is not that place.  After checking it out on Yelp I decided to give this place a try, based on the fact that most of the user-uploaded pictures seemed to make the dishes look great. I called in and ordered for pick-up the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, as it is listed on their menu, because I felt that it'd be best to go with their recommendation.  Do not go with their recommendation.  Upon opening the typical styrofoam box I am greeted by 2 measly shrimp in what would otherwise be considered a sub-par and rather bland Chicken Pad Thai dish. I decided I would give it the benefit of the doubt and chalk this one up to poor mathematics in the kitchen but the rest of the lackluster meal did not make up for it.  And so the hunt continues for a great take-out Thai restaurant in Tempe."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, my husband and I have been eating here for years, the staff knows is by name and even know what we usually order, highly recommend it, try the #23, it's the best!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Good local Thai place. Our favorites are  the coconut milk soup, satay, diver noodles and pad Thai.  Be aware they automatically add 18% gratuity.  And the % for credit or debit is clearly specified in the menu. The decor is done well with Thai highlights. The staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for the first time last night. We ordered the drunken noodles with chicken, sweet and sour chicken and chicken stay. The noodles had very little chicken and the chicken it did have was over cooked and dry. The sweet and sour chicken was mostly breading with very little meat. The chicken satay appetizer was the best part of our meal, but not good enough for us to come back. On top of the disappointment in the quality and taste of the food, my husband had an upset stomach last night and stayed up for hours. We will be looking for another Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"After being in many cities here in US, I have come to a conclusion that a city could be graded based on 2 criteria... Local coffee shops and Thai restaurants... Phoenix, I believe, happens to have plenty of latter ones... and Thai Rama happens to be one of those... But certainly it's not a Scottsdelish restaurant... if you want to enjoy everything else but food, I wont dare suggest this one's your place... but as far as food is concerned, its amazing ! ... All curries are very well prepared... Lunch is extremely cheap and comes with a bowl of soup, rolls, rice and a curry, which to me is more than sufficient for one... Dinner menu is also great and long enough to make you go and not try everything for a long long time... People are nice and not at all extra polite (I hate it when servers and managers are extra - artificially - polite... ! ) so that you feel like having food at a normal place...   A must go and an affordable place for people who eat out often...."}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend went to dine here. My boyfriend ordered a meal with brown rice (which the waiter didn't even say there was up charge on, she just asked what type of rice he wanted). We get the food and there is a DEAD FLY in his rice. The waiter said she would take it off the bill. We get the bill and they still charged the full amount! When I asked why they said they only took off the $2 up charge for the rice. Worst customer service ever. Go else where for some Thai food."}
{"text":"Still spot on for my favorite Thai food. The lovely and I are both ardent admirers of the panang curry and last night we wondered out loud why we'd been gone for so long!! Still delicious, unctuous curry with fresh ingredients that has yet to be matched elsewhere. Having said that, we have not been disappointed by anything we have tried; we took my vegetarian older brother on a recent visit and he swooned.   Service is always kind and attentive; the food arrives hot and promptly. Added bonus? A kid's menu that accommodates the less sophisticated, chicken tender-needy kiddo. Complete with delicious waffle fries and a very reasonable price.  This is a very relaxed, clean place, with takeout and a liquor license. We want one closer to home!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it was right before closing as it turns out so they offered to go and I ordered the chicken tom yum spicy and it was some of the best tom yum I've had. I would put it neck and neck with my favorite Thai restaurant in LA."}
{"text":"I recently visited Thai Rama during the lunch hour.  My expectation was that there would be a moderate wait time due to the lunch crowd, however, we waited at least 20 minutes after we were seated to even have our drink order taken.  We went ahead and ordered our food at the same time that the waitress finally showed up to ask us what we wanted to drink.  We ended up getting our food about 15 minutes later.  The food was good, but the wait time was excessive.  We contemplated leaving twice during our wait but decided to stay because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I like everything else in the menu, I just can't go for the lunch specials. I'm used to the taste of special Thai cuisine, with lots and lots of flavors and spices. Items on lunch menu are usually salty and don't quite meet my expectations.However. Pork Larb, Crab Fried Rice, and Drunken Noodles from the dinner/regular menu are always the best. Service is prompt and friendly, Thai ice tea glass has large serving size."}
{"text":"We have gone to Thai Rama for about 15 years and still love it. Love the Garlic chicken. Love that you can go from mild to hot to Thai hot. The owner is really friendly. They also have a drive through for call in orders.  Love taking family there."}
{"text":"Let's just say my boyfriend has been sick for three days from one quick dinner here; not only were we rushed out of the place AND he has been violently ill, no refund has been issued even after two phone calls excusing his illness. BOO. Go to Thai e-San instead for quality service and delicious food. It's possible these people had an off night but based off of how our problem was brushed away, we will NOT be returning. Meh"}
{"text":"Love the food. Call us boring but my girl and I always get the same two dishes to share at any Thai spot: yellow curry and pad Thai.   Thai Rama is definitely near the top of my list for Thai in Phoenix! Awesome flavor in the yellow curry and great portions.   They have a random additional charge for using a credit card and they don't warn you about it.... Sick. But still worth the $."}
{"text":"The lunch specials on the weekdays are amazing! They run around $7. I get the mango delight medium. The mango makes it sweet but it certainly tastes better with a kick. Portions are good and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here a lot for lunch and we all really enjoy it. Their lunch portion is the perfect amount of food and comes with delicious soup. I've tried about 3 different dishes but mostly I get the Panang Curry (Thai Hot 1). They have like 10 different levels of spiciness with extra levels that are not even on the menu. I took some friends and family their for dinner once and my Dad got this crazy seafood dish that came out in an aluminum foil swan. He just raved about how delicious it was. I've never had a bad experience and recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local and casual Thai restaurant to enjoy, this is the place to go. I've been a happy customer here for over 3 years and usually order the minced chicken lahb (so dang flavorable) and drunken noodles dish with chicken. I love their sweet mango, sticky rice when it's in season, too.   They know me by name and usually already know what I'll be ordering. Either it's pizza or Thai food every Sunday night and I have to say, Thai Rama usually wins.  I can't even spit a rhyme about this place because it's serious business how much I love it here :P."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch here today, and it was pretty good.  I've been here once before and remember the food as being excellent.  I would give just the food 3.75 stars and 2.5 stars for the service.  The restaurant was about half full at noon, and although our food arrived fairly quickly, the waitress disappeared and my friend resorted to tracking down a pitcher of water in order to refill our glasses.  Spicy Thai food = a need for plenty of water.   I ordered the Mango Delight which is chicken stir-fried with a chili jam, bell peppers, mangos, onion, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots and basil.  It's served with a nice cup of soup, steamed rice, fried wontons and a spring roll w/ sweet/sour sauce on the side.  The sauce was more watery and less spicy than I remember.  She ordered a mild version of Yellow Curry with coconut milk, chicken, potatoes, onions & carrots which she said was very tasty.  She made the comment that since the place was filled with mostly men (and many attractive ones, I might add), the servers were probably more inclined to offer them more attentive service since they tend to tip more.  I would have to agree.  I will try this place again, as it's in a good location and I like their lunch menu. I think that next time I will definitely order my food to go."}
{"text":"The food is good a little spicy but spicy food wont hurt anyone. I usually get pad tai and the coconut soup. Take out is super easy and fast. The staff is really nice too and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have ate at some pretty delicious Thai restaurants around town including Thai Hut and Swaddee Thai, so I do know what tasty and flavorful Thai yumminess is like.  We went here after another restaurant had a huge wait and one of my friends picked this as a nearby stand-in that he had ate at.    The interior of Thai Rama is not so attractive and I tried to look past that.  But the food couldn't save it.  Even the sauce you dip your eggrolls in there has an incredily weird texture and taste.  I got some kind of beef dish with medium spice level.  It was so strange and distasteful that I can't remember what it was even called.  There's no way I will ever go back, even though my kind friend paid for my dinner.  Thai Hut is right down the street.  Save yourself some money and enjoy better Thai there."}
{"text":"This place looks much nicer on the inside! Had a saturday lunch with my dad, it was great! The panang curry and yellow curry were both delicious, and the service was very nice. Do yourself a favor and try the thai iced tea. Great food, reasonable price, give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have been going for years!! Food is excellent.  Mom the owner rocks.  Her son Josh is a great young man.   My favorite.  Tohm kah soup.   Evil jungle noodles.  It's all good.  This place is priced right."}
{"text":"Long before my husband and I met, we were both coming here with our colleagues for the lunch specials. I've been a regular here since 1999. The food is outstanding, and so is the service -- with staffers we've been seeing for more than a decade and who greet us like long-lost family; their faces light up when we walk in the door. Our family favorite is the yellow curried chicken in coconut milk with carrots and potatoes, but you also can't go wrong with the Thai barbecued chicken, the mango delight, the chicken satay, the flaming soup, or the pork wontons. We get double orders of the vegetarian egg rolls stuffed with carrots, cabbage, and glass noodles, and I can never get enough of the chicken-cabbage soup that only comes with the weekday lunch specials and doesn't appear on the menu. The coconut ice cream is made in-house and is phenomenal. Come during the week for lunch (it gets crowded, so come early) or for a leisurely weekend feast. Either way, you can't go wrong dining here."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food here!! My favorite is the yellow curry.  We eat here a few times a month.  I will agree that the service isnt the best or the fastest but sometimes you can manage to get in and out in a decent amount of time.  We recently ate here for lunch and the curry wasnt up to par, so we pointed it out to one of the waitstaff, she offered to bring a new plate of it, but its all cooked together in a big pot, so that didnt really make sense. Then the owner, who is the cook came out and TOLD me that it is the same as it always is, and was actually irritated that I would even question her cooking.  The friendly waitress that offered a new plate even said to us that the owner was **** hurt that a customer wasnt happy.  If I owned a place, and my food was off a day, I would want a nice customer to carefully point it out and correct it, not argue that its how it should be. Of course we'll eat here again and again and again, because we have had many great meals here.  I just wish that owners and staff would recognize in this tough economy, that they should take care of their customers, and treat them kindly and recognize that sometimes people need to have quicker service because they need to get back to work, or just dont have a few hours to hang out waiting for the check."}
{"text":"I've gotten to the point there I come by here almost once a week. Yes, it's addictive.   Their lunch specials menu is not very veg friendly, and neither is their free soup you get around lunch.  That said, almost everything else on the menu comes with a choice of meat, or tofu and veggies.  I LOVE both the Tom Kah and Tom Yum soups; even the half portion is huge! The salad rolls are also a great deal for $3.  If you come when it's crowded, the service is a bit slow, but it is given with a smile, and the food is great; taste and selection.  Their lunch special prices are super good, but even the non-specials are on par for a Thai place. Clearly, I come back again and again."}
{"text":"Second time here. Food is good, iced tea is good. But getting served takes a little bit longer than other Thai places I've been too. We all got our orders taken at the same time, but served at different times. Two coworkers with us for their food when everyone else got done eating. Doubt I'll come back here."}
{"text":"It smelled overwhelmingly fishy upon entering, which worried us both. Once inside, the service was good but nothing special. The pad see ew was oddly spicy and overcooked to the point of being dry. The cashew chicken was excellent  and very fresh tasting. There was plenty of leftovers to take home. The mango with sticky rice was good but we have had better. We would try it again but I would skip the pad see ew."}
{"text":"My daughter picked this for her birthday dinner. We walked in and when i requested a table for 6 adults and 1 high chair they tried to cram us into a small booth. When i told the waitress that we couldn't even drink water without hitting each others elbows she suggested that my 11 year old sit on my lap so we could have more space. After telling her that either we get a bigger booth (which was available) or we would leave she very rudely pointed to me that we could sit wherever we wanted. So after about 10 minutes of settling down at our new table she comes over to take our drink order. I have a 18 month old boy. to try and have him avoid crying or yelling i was entertaining him with a couple of sugar packets, which i was going to use for my iced tea anyways. she comes over and tells me to please stop playing around as \"those aren't toys\". i asked her how much a pack of sugar would cost so i could just buy it from her. she stated that they don't sell them. the food was decent but the service is one of the worst I've ever had. also, they don't state anywhere that there is a mandatory gratuity fee for party's of 6 or more but i was still charged for it. when i asked the manager she stated that that is common practice. i told her that i agree but that it has to be announced somewhere. never again..."}
{"text":"I love the food! However, it is definitely inconsistent with the spicy temperatures. If you don't mind paying $12 for a plate of Pad Thai (it is pretty tasty) that is sometimes Mild when you order it Medium... Then Thai Rama is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place a descent Thai food at very reasonable prices. I love their green coconut curry with shrimp as well as their special shrimp fried rice. Portions are also very generous, the only reason why my review gets 4 stars today is because the parking can be tricky. Other that it's a great little hidden joint."}
{"text":"Hello!  Yummy! Double Yummaaaaaaaaey!  First I have to thank Amber \"did someone say chipotle\"W for guiding me to Thai Rama.   I have had thai in the past but I have to admit it isnt all that often, and I dont even know if I remembered what it tasted like to be honest. Until now. This was an amazing meal. We both had the same thing  Evil Jungle Noodles. A tounge tickling adventure made from curried coconut milk with tofu and vegetables. Holy uncow people this food is effin good OK! Usually we split our lunch just to save the calories, but this time I am uber glad we did not. I am already drooling thinking about the leftovers. I cannot wait to go back and I have not evenfinished what I got today!  Review time  Curbage: 7 or 8  Kinda plain but nice Seating time: 10 Wait time: 3 It was busy so it took a few for help but that is ok it took us a few to contemplate the munu on our first trip. We also had a long delay for our food to arrive at the table but for this kind of taste I will wait until the cows come home to live peacefully forever. Food: 10  P factor: I dunno    Awesome job Thai Rama!  Late! Gordo  ps: Dont forget to try the Phuket beer"}
{"text":"I come in every once in a while for their great lunch specials. Although they were just recovering from the first wave of the lunch rush and new customers were seating themselves at unbiased tables, the server brought my iced tea, water and soup in advance of getting my order. Great service here, as always."}
{"text":"I went with a group of women and we had a nice experience.  I ordered the salad rolls for an appetizer and was disappointed.  I didn't think they were very tasty at all and the dipping sauce was tasteless.  When my meal came I didn't get what I had ordered but was brought Pad Thai with tofu instead.  I didn't complain and very much enjoyed the Pad Thai.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE!!!  the food was INCREDIBLE but a little pricy.  THATS MY ONLY COMPLAINT, if you even wanna call that a COMPLAINT!?  My roomie and I ordered an appetizer, two main dishes and thai iced tea and... with tip, paid almost $50 total.   I must reiterate again...  the food was GREAT but a LITTLE over priced.  Would I come back?  HECK YEAH!  No doubt, but only if I was trying to impress a date or on a special occasion.  The pineapple fried rice was AMAZING!  I highgly recommend it, which says a LOT because I HATE pineapple in my food.  LOL!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here after looking for a place to grab dinner while out doing some other errands, and all I can say is I finally found a Thai place in Phoenix that I like.  The place was sort of empty, only a few other diners were present, but the seating was comfy and the atmosphere pleasant.  The menu is simple (only two pages) with a nice description of everything.  The food had awesome flavours and was spiced perfectly, and the green curry, yum!  I need to get more of that asap.  I also liked how the staff left you alone for the most part.  We were seated, given several minutes to look over the menu, placed our order, and once the food arrived we were given a decent amount of time to eat before being \"checked on\".  I'm sort of strange like that, both having worked in food service for years and having eaten out more than I probably should, I find myself one of the few people I know who actually likes to be left alone (for the most part) while eating.  I definitely want to go there again, and soon!"}
{"text":"I'm torn! The food was good but the service was terrible. The waitresses were rushing us the whole time. I don't want to judge this place off of the service but it almost makes me not want to come back!!   Edit: Camelback after the second time and my mind has been changed. Great food and okay service. So good and such big portions. You'll want to take the leftovers home."}
{"text":"We visited again and had better service the second time. The Penang curry (thicker, richer, milkier) was good, but I prefer the yellow curry (spicier, purer). The tahm yahm goong soup is a must-have. The papaya was okay, but we've had better. On the 5-point spiciness scale, I recommend a 3 for the soup and a 5 for the curry. See my original review for more details. This is a great place for Thai food."}
{"text":"My family of five, who is used to eating VERY good Thai food loved this place! We ordered all of our favorite dishes and loved them all! Five stars."}
{"text":"Met my 2 girlfriends here for dinner last night. It was my first time there.. They frequent it often. They raved about the food. Service was fine. We had veggie egg rolls as an app. I ordered the coconut chicken hot pot soup. It was a good flavor. Friends both got the same thing. I think a # 25, which they get often.  Mid dinner I noticed something moving between us and it was a HUGE ROACH on the back of the booth. Scared the hell out of all of us. We all screamed and jumped out of the booth, making a scene. Everyone in the place was staring at us and the owner was sitting towards the back of the restaurant eating. She asked what was wrong and we said there was a huge Roach on our booth. She remained seated and said, oh that's because it's so hot outside. They like to come in! That was it! No apologies, nothing! She didn't even get up from the table and kept eating. Needless to say, we were done eating and just wanted to leave. They didn't offer to comp our meal/meals, give an apology or anything. They just plain didn't give a crap! I will never go back and will be calling the health department next! Don't go to this Roach infested place!"}
{"text":"Great service! Tasty food! The cup of cabbage soup is so warm & has so much flavor! It's a great feeling to walk in a place that you are a regular and they automatically know your food order! Now thats Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food place in Chandler. I always hit it up when I'm in town and always order the Pad Thai. It's consistently good. Their lunch special is a pretty decent deal. You get the Pad Thai along with soup, an egg roll and a couple of friend won tons for 10 bucks. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I've been to Thai Rama 3-4 a dozen times, and this review is the combination of those experiences.  Food:  Good.  Honestly probably too many choices so it becomes a bit tough to decide what you want.  Would like the option of brown or friend rice up front (all dishes come w. sticky rice).  I'm a green curry junkie, so I'm biased when I say that is quite good  Ambiance:  Relatively casual.  Tip #1:  The food is properly spicy, so expect some pretty serious heat for 4 stars and for f5 stars, watch out!  Service:  OK.  They tend to be a bit on the slow side and the waiters are not very familiar with the menu, so they are not very helpful when it comes to making recommendations.  They are all relatively pleasant though.  Prices:  Mid-range.  ~$12/person.  Net:  This is a solid lunch place when looking for something simple and not too difficult/complicated.  I'm a bit on the fence between 3 and 4 stars.  The big pro is the price for a mean is quite cheap for decent food.  Service is on the weaker side despite being nice.  Food is good but not great.  I gave Thai Rama 4 stars but it's on the weaker side of that."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. We love the Garlic Stir Fry with chicken, the spicy fried rice with chicken (medium) and the various Thai curries (Red, Yellow, Massaman and Panang). Highly recommend (and this is odd) but mixing the Garlic Stir Fry with chicken and the Panang curry with chicken together, the flavors work well. For dessert, their mango mousse is delicious and is a pound cake base, with a mango filling, almost set up like a cheesecake.   Excellent food, excellent service and very reasonable."}
{"text":"Rating: 4 Stars. Very good Thai food.  What I Liked: The Garlic Chicken!! The Chicken Rice soup they serve before the meal was also very good. Spring Rolls are good. I haven't had too many different dishes here yet--I keep going back to the Garlic Chicken. But, everything I have ordered and sampled I really liked.  Room For Improvement: Although the servers were very nice, the busboy was slow. We had to wait for a while to be seated not because there were no tables, but because there were no clean tables.  Overall: Well, as much as I'd hate for this place to get even more crowded, I do recommend Thai Rama...wholeheartedly. You will love it...just like me...and everyone else. Now quit telling people about this place or I'll never be able to get a table."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we come here. I've been to many Thai restaurants in the chandler area and Thai Rama just has the best flavor and consistency. It's always my go-to Thai fix. I eat there once a week. I highly recommend the pad si ew, I get it almost every time."}
{"text":"This visit was quite good. Maybe with out the rush of lunch time can be put in to each dish.  We start with a curry soup. IT was large enough to feed 5. The flavors were rich and the veggies were fresh and plentiful.  For the main course we shared many dishes. There was a wide flat rice noodle dish that had a great Wake flavor form the hot wok on the noodles and egg. The curries were nice too however a bit mild for my tastes, be sure to ask for the spicy caddy.   Prices were affordable about $8-9 per dish"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took my mom here last night to try her first taste of Thai food.   There happy hour boasts a decent list of cheap appetizers, so we ordered the shrimp and veggie tempura, crab puffs, and beef satay with three Thai teas.  All of our appetizers came out quickly and were fantastic. I love the peanut sauce that comes with the satay. My boyfriend's favorite appetizer is crab puffs, and they were crispy, and not over-fried/greasy.   For entr√©es, my mother ordered the Mango Delight with shrimp, my boyfriend ordered his staple of Paht Thai noodles, and I got my favorite: Red Curry.  The server advised my mother that Thai spice is different than other spice, so ordering her dish mild may be wise.   We had never tried the Delight before. It was sweet and spicy with crunchy vegetables, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. My mom absolutely loved it.   The prices are decent, and the service was good. We had a ton of leftovers (which I can't complain about!)"}
{"text":"I love their food. The staff is super friendly. Over all a great place to have lunch or dinner plus their Thai tea is the best"}
{"text":"Went out and ordered some quick take out in between games. It was around 11:05 am and the restaurant opened at 11:30. The door was open some we asked if they would make some take out boxes with 1/2 Thai Beef Salad and 1/2 Chicken Larb. They accommodated our order and did it in about 15 min.   We got back to the game and tried the food. The Beef salad was one the best Thai beef salads I have ever had. The chicken larb was very good too. I am sorry that we did not have time to eat a full meal there. I was pleasantly surprised and all the people seated around us wished they had gone out for take out too. Thai Rama staff did a great job. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was good. One of the best places for Thai food I've found in AZ so far. We ordered Pad See Ew, Pad Thai and Red Curry with Thai Teas to drink. The Pad See Ew looked a little mushy when it came out but when I tasted it... it was very good.. I liked how they used regular broccoli and chinese broccoli in it. They also use a lot of garlic in it. Pad Thai was decent. It wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad either. The Red Curry was yummy! It came with bamboo shoots, green beans and thai eggplants. We ordered it with medium spice and it was perfect. They didn't overdo it with coconut milk. Thai Tea was decent as well.   It's slightly pricy for Thai Food in my opinion since I'm used to prices of Thai joints in LA ($5-8 range all day... no price hike up for the same dish just because it's dinner time, why do they do that here in AZ???) But portions were good so I guess it's not that bad. Only one thing though... service was so    S.... L.... O.... W..... I know it was a Friday night and everyone and their mom is out for dinner but wow... there was only two of us and we were there for almost two hours and we both are fast eaters."}
{"text":"I love the food here but service is ridiculously slow and painful. I go there all the time but time after time, I am disappointed with how long it takes for service. I hate being a poor tipper but by the end of our meal I get so pissed with how unattentive some of the waiters are. It costs $3 an hour for waiters, hire more staff!what is the hold up when there are consistently horrible reviews on service!"}
{"text":"Really great restaurant, just not the most authentic Thai food in the valley, so hey ASU students, this is the perfect Thai restaurant to take Grandma & Grandpa, who are visiting from Ohio, and make them feel adventurous. They will be greeted by an adorable Thai hostess with an amazing Thai smile. They will sit in a beautiful Thai atmosphere (just ignore the bar in the back corner with the TV) and eat with authentic Thai embroidered cloth napkins.  Everything on the menu will be legible and its contents will be explained in detail, and of course you have the option of how spicy you would like your dish.   When the food arrives the veggies are fresh, the sauces are flavorful, and according to my mother, the meat is cooked perfect. And when the bill comes, it is a bit pricey, so students, make sure Gma & Gpa, or in my case Mom, are paying. And did I mention this place is super vegan friendly, just ask and they will make you anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. There food is to die for. Customer service is wonderful. Prices are just right. This is the best family owned business in AZ. Mango Delight is my favorite stir fry but my favorite curt is the seafood platter. Everything is always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"We came in during lunch so there was quite a lot of people. I don't mind waiting, but I hate not being acknowledged or greeted. I keep staring at the waitress hoping she see that we were standing to be seated. But the waitress didn't even glance at us to even say 'we'll be with you in a moment'. After maybe 10-15 min of standing and staring around, the waitress finally come and point us to a table.   The food is just okay. We order pad thai and two stir fry dishes. The food isn't bad but the taste didn't leave an impression with me."}
{"text":"I have a former co-worker who lives nearby and gave me a hint about this place.  Turns out, I'm not the only one in the household who has wanted to go here.  Stopped in for a quick lunch and had one of the most fantastic Thai experiences!  We started off with the Gai Tohm Khak Soup ... a wonderful rendition full of flavor and ingredients ... they don't just serve flavored coconut milk with a few things tossed in!  My dining companion had the Red Curry and loved it... a generous bowl of rice served along side.  For me, the Gai Mamuang Himaphan - ordered medium spicy.  Chicken stir fry with bell peppers, onions, carrots, water chestnuts, and lots of cashew nuts with a hoisin and oyster sauce.  OMG ... I think I would like it one click down in heat - but still - a very enjoyable meal.  Again - served with oodles of rice.  This place is on my shortlist for a return visit."}
{"text":"I want to like Thai Rama. I do.  I'd eaten at Thai Rama's Rural & University location for years (dating back to when the establishment was still called Char's!), so I was excited when a location opened up relatively close to my apartment. Their food is actually decent, but their service is so consistently bad that I actually have to dock them three stars for it.   Every time I seem to go there, they seem constantly understaffed - there's often only one (sometimes two) waiters working the floor, so it takes the staff forever to make it to your table, be it to take your order, refill your drinks, or even hand you the receipt. The waits for meals have been similarly atrocious - in my last few trips there, fifty-plus minute waits for meals have quickly become the norm. I'm really not sure what the situation is in their kitchen, but I'm sure it's less than optimal.  Oh, and the fact that their portions have shrunk over the last few months certainly aren't helping their case, either. It's disappointing, because they're really capable of so much more than this."}
{"text":"We love this place! I always get the Evil Jungle Princess curry and hubski gets whatever he feels like in the moment. He only remembers the Thai tea. The service is friendly and the ambiance is cozy. Just don't mispronounce the beer when you order Phuket ;)"}
{"text":"I love Thai Rama. This place has been here for as long as I can remember. Tom kha gai is phenomenal. It's hot and sour chicken soup with ginger, lime, and coconut milk. I've gotten this twice from this location and I swear it has mushrooms in it even though the online menu doesn't list them. Beware the galangal in the soup. It's basically a type of ginger, but don't bite into it. It's just there for flavoring and they usually leave it in big square or rectangle chunks. I'm a garlic fan. Can never have enough so the gratiam prig thai is a go-to dish for me too. It's a meat in a spicy garlic sauce. I choose chicken and it's never been dried out or rubbery."}
{"text":"Excellent Panang curry. I am a huge fan now. I would definitely recommend the red curry as well. Spice level was perfect and service was good. Overall a very nice Thai place. Only shortcoming of this place is the price, a tad expensive for poor grad students like me."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the atmosphere is charming and clean, but unfortunately the service can lack at times... All in all a wonderful place."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Thai food over the years so my standards are pretty high. We ordered the Pad Thai and Yellow curry 3 stars. The Pad Thai was really sweet and way over spiced which I know was a mistake. However, I love spicy and only order 3 star in consideration for my wife. Setting aside the misfire on the spice, the pad Thai just fell short.  The yellow curry was probably one of the blandest I've ever ordered. Thai restaurants tend to not cook this dish properly, the potatoes being not fully cooked is not uncommon. This dish was cooked properly, it just lacked myriads and seasoning in my book.   It's too bad because they have a sweet drive through which makes pickup really convenient."}
{"text":"OK! I will never order anything else from this place it will always be known to me as:  THE BEST GARLIC CHICKEN I'VE EVER HAD!  That's all......!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurant in AZ, everything is so original and not americanized. My fav gonna be Pad See Ew, the famous rice noodle cuisine that I always eat from time to time. It was so delicious and you can really smell the fried rice noodles aroma as they cook it out for you in their kitchen. The next best thing is gonna be FBI - Fried Banana Ice Cream served with vanilla ice cream and honey which I love the most. Tad Hoo Tod is my recommended appetizer. A fried silk tofu that was melt in your mouth and you got to order peanut sauce that compliment the taste. So far, I'm a very happy customer everytime I went here and I'm crossing fingers that they will keep the original taste cause it's superb!"}
{"text":"WOW. DELISH!  I will absolutely be coming back here.  For their food, not for their service though.  The busser was horrible and we had to ask for things numerous times, but the food is worth it.  I had the garlic chicken, medium to very spicy, and it was unbelievably tasty!  I'm still full right now but if you put a plate of it in front of me, I would eat it all.  Went for lunch, got there at 12pm and got a table right away.  Lunch prices are great - about $6-7 for the whole meal which includes soup & spring roll (both tasty).  I will certainly be back, but maybe try for a less busy time (not peak lunch hours) in hopes of getting better service."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their chicken panang, thai hot, is perfection.   The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the service can be a little slow and it gets pretty echo-y inside. Not my first choice for an intimate dinner since you can hear other patrons conversations.  Also, they do take out!  If you are waffling on trying this place: TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Great place to dine.  Been here several times and have never been disappointed.  The service is OK, but the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Thai Rama is in our top 5 restaurants to go to. Our favorite and will definitely recommend is the garlic stir fry. We like it with chicken, I took my mom there for the first time and she loved it she likes the garlic stir fry but with shrimp. They are always very nice and get great customer service."}
{"text":"Should be 4 1/2 stars. Very yummy lunch place never had a bad meal here I always have enough to take home for the next day or dinner. Family owned place;)"}
{"text":"No working website and no answer on their phone when a I called three times. Guess I am ordering from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I love the option of heat level on the spicy Thai dishes they have red pepper powder and pickled jalape√±os On the side to turn it up a notch. It takes a bit of time for dinner, so don't be in a hurry. Take a few friends  and try a few different dishes! I LOVE the Jungle Princess dish and the Thai chicken wings are sweet and tangy."}
{"text":"Poor welcome. Poor service. The phad thai came without tofu!! The lasy at the entrance didnot even have a smile. The waitress seemed in immense hurry and even forced me to talk when I have foof in my mouth!Aas if we are here to impress them!!! Quantity is way too less for 12 dollars!!No soup free no salad free nothing!!! The people in the neighbouring table were beavhing like wild animals and talking loudly but nothing was doen to stop them I promptly rewarded them wth ZERO tip!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is good and so is service.  Friday lunch service can be a little slow but only because of the large groups that show up. Friendly owner and staff.  Delicious food."}
{"text":"We are big Thai Rama fans... from the Thai BBQ Chicken to their several varieties of curries to their wonderful Pahd See Ew, Thai Rama offers outstanding food at excellent prices. On top of it all, the friendly staff makes sure everyone enjoys not just their meals but their visit, as well. It's not only a regular place we visit, but a \"must do\" place we take family and friends when they are visiting in town."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Thai Rama for 4 years now. I have frequented all three locations and had trouble deciding which to review: the location with the best food (Phoenix), OR the location I last went to last (Tempe), OR the location I started going to in the very beginning (Chandler). You can imagine with these decisions to make why it took me so long to write my review....Oh and don't forget the question of whether I should review all three!?!?!? Just Kidding! Decision decisions.  So I am doing the responsible thing and reviewing the Newest Location and the last one I went to.  My friends and I always order #20 Shrimp, Lemon grass, coconut milk steaming bowl of a soup that is a little sour and just so flavorful and delicious, with beautiful mushrooms and great big shrimp. Could be one of my last meals on this planet and I would be happy! Don't forget it comes to the table on fire! I always wondered if you got it to go...do you get the fire too!  #61 wide noodles with dark soy sauce chicken, eggs and broccoli. Which is probably my favorite noodle dish of all time!. I like there Phat Thai, but the best one is at the Phoenix Location.   Their Panang Curry is THE BEST, actually any of the 3 locations have great Panang! Only order if you are fan of Coconut Milk. I most definitely am!  Thai Rama will always be my go to Thai place. I am sure there are other great Thai places, but sometimes is nice to go to a restaurant and know exactly what to order!"}
{"text":"Best Thai iced coffee and yellow curry, hands down.  The staff are friendly and service is great. Their lunch specials are awesome and comes with soup,  Egg roll, and entree for around 7 bucks! Yes please."}
{"text":"Great lunch special - delicious green curry, and pad thai is good, but FYI, even 'medium' hot is still hot (but good!) Egg rolls and soup were delicious - overall, the meal was great. Will say the Pad Thai wasn't as delicious today as other days, but still highly recommend Thai Rama."}
{"text":"Pretty good deal on the lunch specials - all around $9. Unfortunately, had a craving for the drunken noodles so I ordered off the lunch menu the noodles with beef ($10-12) and it was huge and pretty good. The food is solid and it looks pretty authentic."}
{"text":"We go here only for their fried rice and order it Thai hot+ and I will bet you its the best thing you ever ate...Thai. Now you should have a palate that can be alive to appreciate the taste after you have it!!!!My place for Thai fried rice...."}
{"text":"Canned peas and corn in my soup and curry. No thanks.  Curry was runny and the noodles in my drunken noodles were overcooked and super, super greasy.  I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Arizona love this place they do get packed with a lunch crowd and usually have only 1-2 servers on but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Lunch is generous and delicious and dinner is just as good. The yellow chicken curry is the stuff dreams are made of and the Tom Kai gai soup has kept me coming back (despite moving around the country) for 10 years."}
{"text":"l thought l was patronizing a Thai restaurant. However, this place is no where close to authentic or even good Thai food. l ordered the tom yum seafood combo, it's a sweet and sour seafood soup and l ordered a side of white rice.  My food was inedible.   Their tom yum was a poor amateur of the real deal, if you know Thai food and this dish you'll know what I'm getting at with the description of what l was served.  This dish only had the following:  two small shrimp, squid, unshelled mussels, jalapenos, ginger and thinly sliced button mushrooms.  The dish wasn't sweet or sour, it was however extremely salty, the seafood was overcooked big time and the side of white rice was gelatinous from too much water when it was cooked, the grains stuck together instead of being light and fluffy.   lt didn't have the typical additional ingredients of fresh thai chili, lemon grass, tamarind, mussels in the half shell, seafood cooked medium, fresh spiced tomatoes, chili flakes, fresh lime and other garnish toppings. It lacked greatly in presentation, taste and aroma.    Two others in my party where also disappointed in their dish too.    I'm not Thai, but am very familiar with the food and have made it myself a number of times. lt's just nice to have it elsewhere without having to do all the prep and other work involved in it.  Long wait time on average to be seated with our party and witnessed others waiting when it wasn't busy.  Sadly, l cannot recommend this place or return."}
{"text":"I'm giving this four stars for the following reasons:  I've only ever been here twice, today being the second day. First, the food was just as good as the first time. This time I ordered to go, really wished I could have called in a head of time, but I didn't have a menu handy and I couldn't find a menu anywhere on their site - I could have missed it. But either way, grabbed one on the way out as I'm certain to be here again. And also, they have a drive thru which makes it a quick spot to stop by on the go. For me personally, its basically around the corner, less than 10 minutes away. I expect the third experience will be just as pleasant as the previous. Now if only they served duck..."}
{"text":"The green curry is not so good. It's very basic and just tastes like paste mixed with coconut. I prefer when there is fresh lemongrass and thai basil in it and some spice, heat and more seasoning.   However, I had this soup there. I'm not sure which one it is. It's closer to the bottom of the soup menu. It's served in one of the metal bowl things with the flame under it. It is red and has lots of lemon grass stalks in it and what looks like it might be galangal(?)  woody looking chips, chicken (I don't even like chicken) and spicy deliciousness (that's an ingredient now). This soup is killer. I think about it all the time. If I could marry it, I might. It's only $8 as well and enough for two people to share, and I would go as far as to say that it would fill you up at lunch time.  Go there, try this soup.   Other than that.... um the place isn't very nice but it's not bad either, just a casual small little restaurant. The service is good- nothing else is very memorable about it for me except that soup, Good stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent food and reasonable prices. I love the drive through pick up window very convenient!  Medium curry hotness is perfect flavor not too hot and not bland . I would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Thai Rama is our most favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. Try the green curry or the evil jungle noodles."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Very friendly service. Neighborhoodish, family-owned, no frills environment. The tom kha gai (soup) is not as spectacular as at Malee's, but in the Phoenix area very little if anything else is. I had a sampling of several different dishes shared between a group of 5 of us, and all of them were tasty.   Love the location, which is 5-10 minutes from the 7th Ave train stop. (Do not attempt alone at night if you aren't Chuck Norris)."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner.  Food was good but the service staff came across as painfully shy.  Our waiter talked so softly, we had difficulty hearing him (the noise level in the restaurant was low).  Our glasses of water sat empty for a while before someone came over to refill.    Our appetizer dish (chicken wings) came out quickly.  It was delicious.  But the main course took a while to arrive.  It was hot and tasted good.   Overall, the food was what we expected, but the service was very slow."}
{"text":"My family and I love Thai Rama.    The food is always good and they have take great pride in their service."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Best Thai food I've had here in the states. Our fist visit we ordered food to take home it was that good. Going to make this our regular spot. Can't believe I didn't find this sooner."}
{"text":"Yellow curry was excellent. Moved here from CA one year ago and finally found legit thai. Thank you, will be back."}
{"text":"I'd Penang curry. It was lip smacking. Recommended to all spicy food lovers."}
{"text":"OK in a pinch but really very average when it comes to Thai food. Decent lunches but not a great Thai place like Lattitude 8."}
{"text":"I been here before it was great.  Second time I walked thru the door and the people who came after me where seated first when I was finally seated I was not acknowledged at all. Then finally the waiter came by and asked if I wanted a menu. After he finally gave us a menu I sat there for like 20 mins waiting for someone to take my order, while people that got there after me where getting there orders taken. At that point I walked out because of the poor service.  I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"The staff are very attentive. Very friendly. We had a party of 10 and they were patient and brought out all of our food at the same time. Everything tasted amazing  and was fresh! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"True taste of authentic Thai food in Phoenix. I do recommend this place.  We ordered crab fried rice, seafood Tom yam, pad see ew, Pla koong, Tom Kha, pad prik khing."}
{"text":"So this review is mostly based on the experience, not so much the food as I am admittingly not a huge Thai food fan.  My GF swears this is the best Thai food in Phoenix so I took her.  Now we did come at noon which is lunch time.  Parking lot has maybe 12 spaces and very tight.  If you have a nicer or bigger car, I'd reccommend parking on the street.  So we had a young lady serve us about 90% of the time.  She sat is, handed us menu's and walked away.  She brought us waters and walked away and never asked if we wanted anything else to drink.  About 10mins went by and she took our order.  Before I could get my drink order out she was gone again.  Finally I flagged her down and asked her for sodas.  My girlfriend said Coke or Pepsi.  We both got coke and I ordered Pepsi.  Fine no biggie.  My girlfriend ordered her normal 62 and it was amazing as always according to her.   I got the sweet & sour chicken and I must say it was pretty dang good.  Crispy breading and plenty of chicken.  I ordered some Wonton chips and she brought me back some deep fried stuffed wontons.  I figured whatever, I'll eat around the stuffing.  Girl never came back to check on us or refill us.   Finally an older lady came by and was awesome! She was so friendly and polite and actually explained the wonton they gave me on accident.  She made it right without being asked and was perfect.  She took my service experience from a 2 to a 3.  Maybe next time we can bump this up to 4 stars.  I'll give them a second round try soon."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and she said the food was amazing so my boyfriend and I came to try this place out. This place is only two miles from where we live so it was nice that we didn't have to drive to far to grab dinner. We were seated right away and the hostess brought our drinks out fast.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Thai Toast, Tom Kha soup, Pat Si Ew and got Sticky Mango Rice to go. Everything we ordered was delicious. I really like that they have you four types of chili sauce to accompany your food. Usually most places just give you the red chili paste but I enjoyed the variety. Although the food was delicious I'm giving them 3 star because our service was horrible! Our server was super slow , did not come up see if we needed drink refills and after we were done with our food, we waited almost 20 min before he asked us if we needed our check. We also asked for a bag to put our leftovers in and he totally forgot. We eventually had to ask the hostess for a bag instead. The restaurant wasn't that busy so I don't understand why our service sucked. I would recommend just  calling in your order and picking up the good. ( hopefully they answer the phone because we saw the server pick up the phone and just hang up when the phone kept ringing)"}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall but they have some great choices. Pad Thai is always a good option. Fast and friendly service. Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Still love this Thai restaurant! Loving the yellow beef curry. I like to eat in the restaurant and also order in and pick up. Best place hands down"}
{"text":"The food is good which deserves 4 stars but the way I feel every time I pick up my food brought my rating to a 2.  It's like you are putting them out by coming in or going thru the drive thru. (Especially the big white guy with all the ink). It's a 20 minute drive from my house so allot of times I will go in to order take out.  Apparently they would prefer I call but that is pretty useless when they don't answer the phone!    I prefer to give my money to someone that appreciates the business."}
{"text":"7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great....   All dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup...  its new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P   walks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K...   As soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :)   the lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?!   in the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed...   as soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said \"Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?\" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? \"um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... \" he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird   he got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score!   once we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing...  he had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli...   so the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm   then he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!?   once we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying \"pardon me or excuse me\" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified!   End Result....   Good Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :)  The Service was nice...  Nice atmosphere...  Horrible date...  Wish i had had better company :(   oh and i Tossed out his number..."}
{"text":"I'll start with the food. It's great I love the curry.  The price, acceptable or more like affordable.  Service, terrible. I would've given them 3 stars and visit more often if they have a decent service."}
{"text":"These folks get five stars for their delicious food, despite spotty and inconsistent service. They re-opened after being closed for repairs needed because a taxi decided to park in their dining room."}
{"text":"\"My tea is good\" according to my friend.  Aside from that; I thought the food was okay.  I eat a lot of Thai food and nothing really popped except my taste buds burning......yeah it was spicy!  \"The tea here is really good\" noted friend!  Decor of the place was nice and and low key; starting to wonder if all Thai restaurants use the same Interior Designer.  \"This is good tea\" yes, my friend I know :).  Our service was also good and nothing to complain about.  My water was always full and our waitress was attentive.  How's the tea?  Well I think you know the answer to that - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant for dinner. Our server looked like he was at least 20 years old, probably the son of the owner. He seemed confused, didn't have any eye contact, but he was a nice kid. We ordered squid appetizer and shrimp red curry. Both were just okay, not great. I am going to give this restaurant another shot, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Bland Thai food in a Bland part of town. The staff was nice and attentive and the decor was inventive but the menu and the food were tired.  Much better options in Scottsdale and the East Valley if one is in the mood for Thai Food"}
{"text":"First time I came here, I loved the salad that I ordered. It tasted fresh. This time, I ordered the Pad Thai. It tasted all right. I mean it looked fantastic in the picture that I took but the taste just didn't do it justice. I think I went to Thai Elephant in Tempe and had better Pad Thai.  The atmosphere was kind of dim and bland. For the lack of decor, I swear the food could have been a little less expensive. And the service was not terrible but it also wasn't great. The waitress was your typical Asian restaurant waitress that was just there to take order and bring out food.  Overall, this atmosphere is rather bland and the food mildly expensive. It makes decent Thai food and you'll get it at this restaurant but nothing here says WOW, FANTASTIC BABY."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and literally can't stop thinking about all the food I ate. I went with a group of 12ish people which was great because it was my first time actually eating at a Thai restaurant so I got to try a few different dishes. I would definitely recommended the crab puffs and the egg rolls weren't bad either. Very crispy and a great sweet and sour sauce to go with them. The spicy mustard is intense. Try it. I ordered the number 66 on the menu which was a Spicy fried rice with chicken. Very good, you can choose how spicy and I went medium spicy which I felt was a very good balance of tasty and spicy. HUGE portions. I can't remember the names of everything else that I tried but everybody left satisfied. One guy in our group got the sweet and sour chicken which he absolutely loved. He was raving about it, it was almost like he was in love with it so if you like sweet and sour chicken I'd say to go for it. I'm definitely going back and I really hope it's soon because it was so good."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get consistent asian food. Its not amazing, but always good. The decor inside is like every other Thai place you've seen, and of course has the mandatory paintings of Thai royalty.    I really liked our waiter. He was funny and he and my dad talked all about their new Google Androids. Our waiter even showed us how to put the protector cover on the android without bubbles. Sometimes waiters are annoying when they get all friendly like that, but this guy was cool. He was great about filling water, bringing requested hot sauces, and bringing us chopsticks too.   And the prices are VERY reasonable. Most of the non-noodle dishes come with rice, whereas at other restaurants you have to order rice separately."}
{"text":"Far from the best Thai food I've had, but the best Thai I've had in Arizona.  Visited with friends while in Phoenix one night.  I had low expectations.   We ordered fish cakes and papaya salad to share.  I had a red vegetable curry.  The waitress was friendly, and my friends ordered their meals Thai hot.   I'd been suffering from bland food for several days, and   I explained that I wanted my meal much hotter than theirs.  That I wanted to cry on the first bite.   My friend summarized-- \"9/11 hot\".      The fish cakes were excellent,  which led to unspoken hostility over who would get the last piece.  The Papaya salad was full of flavor and intense heat that took some time to appear over the sweet and cold flavors of the salad.  The main meal was served as I ordered it.  I cried on the first bite.  It was like tear gas in a bowl.    The heat was mostly from fresh diced chilis-- perfect.   This made me very happy.   It's so difficult to find a restaurant that serves hot when requested.  Curry was a bit lacking in vegetables, should have made my usual request for extra broccoli."}
{"text":"I recently went here for lunch with a co-worker. It is literally around the corner from our office so we wanted to try someplace new. I had only had Thai once before at a different restaurant so I was a little hesitant to try it since I don't enjoy really spicy food. The place itself is pretty small but were greeted promptly and given our drinks quickly. I really enjoyed the soup that came with the lunch special I ordered (mango chicken). The mango chicken was really delicious and I made sure to order it mild. I tried the yellow curry dish my friend ordered and liked that as well.   I will definitely come back for it's convenience, quick service and good food. It was also priced well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally went to this place on a Friday evening. It wasn't busy at all. We waited several minutes at the hostess stand before anyone even acknowledged us and showed us to a table. Their sign clearly says \"please wait to be seated\" or else we might have sat ourselves. Once we were seated, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to take our drink and food orders. We started with the egg rolls, which were clearly frozen egg rolls they just put in the fryer. My husband ordered the mango beef and I ordered the chicken fried rice. Food came out quickly- mine was better than his but we both said the meats were not fresh and tasted like they were re-heated from being frozen. Very underwhelemed with the service and food. We will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"I had the red curry for lunch and it was delicious!  I wanted it Thai hot and boy did they knock my boots off with the spiciness level!   They know exactly what \"Thai Spicy\" means, not like other wanna be Thai restaurants that don't know how to bring the heat!  I'm happy to finally find a place with delicious Thai food at an affordable price.  I can't wait to get my next dose of spice from them!"}
{"text":"Food has been very good the few times that my family and myself have ben here.   However : Each time it seems like there is some type of issue with the servers or how long it takes etc... Its ok... I will eat here again, just not when its superbusy ..."}
{"text":"Thom Kha soup from Thai Rama is so addicting it should be illegal.  As soon as I finish eating (and eating the leftovers at home) I am craving a return visit."}
{"text":"Since moving to Tempe, I have been very disappointed with the Thai food in the area. I finally tried Thai Rama and it is the best I have had here so far. My favorite dish is pad se ew, so that is what I always look to order. Thai Rama's pad se ew was exactly what I expected pad se ew to be (I say that because some places here have really surprised me, and not in a good way). I am happy to have a found a place that will fulfill my Thai cravings.   I have also had the Tom Kha soup both in the restaurant and gotten it to go. Both times I was pleased with the taste. Again, it was exactly what I expected when I order Tom Kha, so I was happy."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was amazing. The server help me with some changes in the menu to help me make a custom dish that I miss on it.  Pad Thai with chicken and kashio  Highly recommend place."}
{"text":"Its a hole in the wall but the food and.staff is.amazing."}
{"text":"I can't bring myself to give Thai Rama more than 3 stars... I love Thai food, and I wanted to love Thai Rama, but I just didn't.  I thought the restaurant itself was cute, casual, and unassuming... the staff was friendly but not the most attentive.  I was there on a Sunday night recently, and I felt extremely comfortable dining solo (big plus for that).  Unfortunately, when I was given my menu, there was a dried up noodle stuck to it, and the napkins on the tables are pretty but polyester and not the best for wiping the noodle off or absorbing anything at all for that matter.  I was also disappointed that I didn't see a thai salad with peanut dressing or summer rolls on the menu.    I decided to order the #6 to start - Lab Gai (finely chopped chicken lightly sauteed in lemon juice with red onion and mint).  Maybe I should've ordered it without onion because onion was everywhere!  The flavor of the chicken was good, but it was difficult to eat with so much onion.  I went with the vegetarian dish #69 (yes, I said 69) as my entree.  Paht Paug Jae or vegetable deluxe.  I requested that they add eggplant and they did - it was pretty tasty and I cleaned my plate with that one.  Overall, the meal was ok.  Maybe I'm spoiled by some other thai favorites in the valley, but I'm glad I experienced Thai Rama.  I probably will not rush back, but if you're looking for a decent thai meal and you're in the Cen Pho area, you can find it at Thai Rama."}
{"text":"One of my two favorite Thai restaurants.  All the food is top quality, very tasty, and pretty generously portioned.  The service is consistently friendly and efficient here.  Price is good.  Love their spicy garlic (you can get it with any meat)."}
{"text":"Pros:  Just stopped in due to I had just left the eye doctor and had those blinding eye drops added.  Glad I found this place... Service was good and our waitress recommended dished for us that was very helpful due to me beeing half blind.  The wife had the Thai Tea (de-lish) was her response (to bad that did not include free refills)  I had the fresh brewed tea and started with the wings as an appetizer (they were really good and that sauce was fantastic) wife ordered the Thai Noodles  (nice) I had the yellow curry chicken and as a chef I must say I was not expecting the potato that  were sliced corrugated and the carrots were as well with a corrugated fine peeler and the sauce was real coconut milk and heavy whipping cream the chicken was fat free breast meat (it's the little things that make a Great food spot) and they have that here I forgot to even taste my wife's dish so I'm limited to speak on it, but it looked really good too.    Will I go back? Yes! when I have that graving for yellow curry chicken done right when I just don't have the time to do it myself!  Bon App√©tit...  Cons:   Okay here is where they lose a point:  ambiance also ambience  (mb-ns, √§-by√§s)  N.   The special atmosphere or mood created by a particular environment:  Yes it looks like a Thai restaurant but who is in charge of caring for the upkeep in your restaurant such as updating chipping paint, cleaning the glass windows and doors, uneven tables and chairs, dusting etc.  (we both went to the restrooms and I can say the men restroom was clean and as for the ladies restroom shockingly my wife said to go in with a HAZMAT suit!   The chef may be the owner and a male, that could be why his restroom was so much cleaner...lot's of male owners never check the ladies restroom.    They should!"}
{"text":"The food here is DELISH. They have really good service and it's fast! I love coming for lunch here because of it."}
{"text":"This used to be what I considered a spot-on, authentic Thai restaurant.  I almost wrote a letter to their management last time I bought carry out, because I was enormously disappointed when I'd brought an order of Shrimp Pad Thai home, a quite basic and expensive dish, only to find a basic gluten ball with hardly any veggies, and all of FOUR SHRIMP!  They did their usual great job of making Larb, but for a giant pile of rice noodles they sold me as Pad Thai?  SORRY, THAT AIN'T EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.  It's one thing when you dine in and have a chance to voice your dissatisfaction, but it's entirely different when you go to the trouble of picking up your order, just to get home and find you've been seriously ripped off.    I don't have the budget to have the luxury of eating out often, but when I'm wanting to treat myself to something good, and used to like a place like this, I can't see paying big bucks for what amounts to 25-cents worth of rice noodles and four shrimp.  Another reviewer said they changed hands and kept the name, I'd like to know when that happened because I think it may coincide with when they turned into the 'hit and miss'-type place they've obviously now become.  How basic IS Pad Thai anyway?  I lived in Thailand for several years, and I USED to like Thai Rama simply because they did a great job making meals that reminded me of why I fell in love with Thai food in the first place.  Two stars Thai Rama... Get your act together, and go back to when you were a reputable place to eat!  If you don't, a better, quality restaurant will take your place, like a Taco Bell! :-("}
{"text":"Best ever! I have tried many other Thai restaurants and not one of them can hold a candle to this place. I've been going for years and love it. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and I had to come check it out! The pad Thai was excellent! Medium spicy is spicy! #26 the Paht Graphrao was amazing! Highly recommend! The owner even came out and asked how everything was. How can u beat that service?? Definitely will come by again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at an actual Thai restaurant, and I loved it!  Went for lunch and our waitress was very helpful and recommended a great spicy tofu dish, which was amazing!  Lunch combo came with soup, which was sooooo good!  Our waitress said they (the servers) make it themselves during the week for lunch.  It's very light and fresh tasting...and vegetarian!  Also came with a spring roll, rice and wontons.  Our bill came to less than $20 for 2 people!  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a higher rating if it was based solely on food only. I really enjoy coming here for the Panang Curry Chicken which is very tasty. I have been here a few times. I had no issues my first time here and looked forward to returning. The second time, it took the server 25 minutes to take my order and that was only because I went to the counter. I discounted this as an honest mistake and returned yet a third time. This time I was more observant. This time it took 20 minutes to take my order with me having to speak loudly to get my servers attention since my waves were not working basically because I was not being acknowledged. Since I was one of the first to arrive of the lunch crowd and one of the last of the early bunch to have my order taken, I have to say I was not very happy. No apologies were offered when I expressed my concern. They rarely, if at all, come back to refill drinks. It is great food with such disappointing service. Any ideas on where to find great panang chicken with wonderful service?"}
{"text":"Had been to Thai Rama with friends. I was looking for a moderately spicy dish, and I liked the drunken noodles. The ambience is also pretty good P.S: They charge gratuity if there are more than 5 people."}
{"text":"I drove by this place after work in Chandler numerous times and finally decided to give it a try.   I love Thai food but am particular about the Tom Yum soup.  This Thai Rama location makes the best Tom Yum soup, and I have asked for specific veggies, and they listen and make it the way I like.  I have ordered a side of veg and rice as well, and it's always fresh and delicious.   I get take out, since I'm often on my way home from work.  I go in around 4p, so it's an odd hour for dinner, so it's not crowded then.  The service is friendly, but I haven't dine in so haven't had that experience yet.   The only complaint I have is that sometimes on weekends, I call and call and call, and I never get an answer, so I make the trek up to the Thai Rama Tempe, which is similar but not quite as good.  EDIT in 2016:  I have dined in with Thai Rama several times: quick service, fresh and hot food, and decent prices.  The Tom Yum soup remains the best.  However, I would say a major change to my previous review - the Tempe location is not so good at all. This location compared to the Thai Ramas in Phoenix and Tempe far outshines the other two.  I'm glad I am in Chandler every couple weeks to enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Since I love their food 80% of the time I was nice enough to give them 2 stars but after tonight I highly doubt I will return. They are losing so much business now that I will not be promoting their outrageously poor serviced staff and making their food a million times spicier than what it usually sits at.  I ordered to go as usual and I had bad feeling about it since it was almost 9pm when they close. I called and the lady was oh so nice enough to say (we are closing in 5 minutes) No shit sherlock like I didn't already know i am not that dumb by boyfriend decided super last minute that he wanted thai (ugh!) so I knew they were going to ruin our food so badly that I am sitting here typing this instead of eating the delicious panang curry but it is so Damn hot that i cant even eat it and can barely stand even the underlying flavor.  This was extremely dissapointing because i love their food and now with the service and horrid food given the past two times I will not be returning, I can tell you that much right now.   I can bet anyone 5 dollars that with all the reviews regarding their downward spiral of bad service that the owner or manager doesn't give a rats ass that they are doing this bad now.  I remember when we went to the tempe location they have a white racist broad that used a different race as an excuse for the spice level (oh the other cook that made your food is mexican.) SERIOUSLY? what if i was mexican? I would have called the highest up manager I could get.  Completely and Utterly irrelevant. Just make my food the way it is supposed to be made is that so hard to ask for?! Honestly????   So as of 5/15/12 i give them only 1 extra star for giving me a brand new panang curry that was good enough for me. Only problem is there was a younger kid that drew a red heart around my new order slip and wrote his name on typed his name in the top right corner with a winking face. I noticed it as I walked out and just oh for gods sakes really?? I just spoke to this kid about how the food was unbearable to my Boyfriend and myself. Kids These Days....."}
{"text":"I love thai rama for the most part their panang curry and evil jungle noodles are always on point.  But service at this location was not on point, yeah the girl was nice but majority of the time she was on the phone with god knows who.  She rarely came over to see how our food was or if we wanted more to drink given the fact that our food's spice level was a lot hotter than what we asked for.  My friend ordered the paht thai( for some reason is always dry regardless of location)  and myself the panang curry as usual.  My friend had asked for no spices in hers and it came out hotter than my medium panang.  The girl apparently misunderstood our orders obviously since she had nothing to write down our orders on. She said after getting off the phone that it was her mistake even though apparently the chefs have been off  as far as getting the spice levels on point.    She came back after a few minutes and said \"the cook that made your dish was...MEXICAN\" my friend and I could not believe this white girl said that (we are half filipino) to us like that would make a difference. The way she said it was just bizzare to us. If I were part mexican I would have been pissed. It shouldn't matter what someone's race is on who is making the food.  The service was poor here our food came out spicier than called for and the egg rolls seemed lightweight stale.  Not a great way to start our day."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Thai food, and when my friends decided that we were going to visit one on our night out, I was a little concerned about how my selective palate would fair. Upon perusing the menu for something edible, I found the Kids Menu section, under which there were three delicious sounding options I would be able to handle. I was ecstatic to find these, to say the least. I hadn't had macaroni and cheese or corn dogs in quite a long time, and I was eager to treat myself to some embarrassingly amateur dishes. I ended up ordering chicken strips and fries and a large glass of coke. I expected a comment or a \"seriously, chicken strips?\" look from the waiter, but I received none. The service was quick and even patient when one of my companions couldn't decide on what to order.  The food was delicious and set up in an appealing manner. There were three pieces of chicken and two handfuls of waffle-fries, plus a decorative little bit of shredded carrots and a green vegetable I couldn't recall the name of. I didn't ask for any ketchup, but it was given to me, along with a separate bowl to squeeze the ketchup packets into. I was thankful for this, because I hate mixing foods and getting ketchup all over foods it doesn't belong on. The chicken alone could send your taste buds a-moaning. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, it's absolutely delicious. The Colonel can only dream of making chicken this scrumptious. The waffle-fries are another story. They were seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection. I was utterly addicted to their taste with the first bite. That, plus the the right amount of ketchup and my tastes were lost.  Overall, the food was excellent, perfect for those who are hesitant in expanding their palatial horizons and want to stick to something a little more familiar."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food with great prices.  Pad thai with beef and the chicken are so good. Don't get the Thai Spicy or you will be struggling for a couple of days.  The food always delivers. Coworkers and I try this often and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love Thai and have tried most of the restaurants around the valley. Thai Rama had been a place we had not been to based completely on Yelp reviews.  So one night in Tempe instead of going to the reliable Thai Basil, we decided we needed to finally try Thai Rama. Inside is nice, not many people inside. Quaint and homey inside with very kind and gentle waitresses.   I had read that this place was over priced and not very good. I'm not sure where that came from because your standard Thai dish was $9.95 for dinner with some prices on dishes being even a bit lower. You obviously have the more elaborate dishes that cost more, but even then we are talking $12-13 max. So I am not sure where the expensive reviews are coming from.  I was extremely surprised by the taste of the food. Had the Panang Curry chicken and it was very good. A thick sauce which is not typical, but very good with coconut milk drizzled on top. Good amount of chicken and good amount of rice on the side.   Bill was around $25 total for 2 people that both got iced teas, spring rolls and 2 entrees. Good prices, cozy friendly restaurant, and good food!"}
{"text":"**ANSWER YOUR FRIGGEN PHONE!!!!** SLOW SERVICE.   Other than that, I love this place because the food is delicious. I always get the pad-see-eww with chicken and steamed rice (you wont regret it!) It has noodles, broccoli and grilled chicken with the best sauce and flavor ever)  Service inside and to go is slow. Even when there aren't many customers in the restaurant.  I was disappointed last week when I called them for 15 min straight (while driving) and got no answer. When I walked in, I noticed like 4 guests inside and the phone was still ringing and not one employee acknowledged it. Are they really willing to lose sales that way?? Crazy!! They're lucky I like them so much that I took the time to order it to go in person and still wait 15 more min for it to cook. I would have preferred to order it while driving so by the time I get there its ready. That's what to go orders are for. They even have a to go drive thru for phone orders.....soooooo answer your calls!!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, I've been a little disappointed about the Asian eateries in Phoenix. In the heart of Southwest spice they usually trend toward the milder cuisines, such as Cantonese, or are so Americanified to really be fusion, not true Asian.   Finally I've found a Thai eatery that screams authenticity!  Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I went with such high hopes, too.  I had the red curry beef. Well, the beef was very strange in texture and oddly shaped. I hope it was beef.   My friend had some kind of stir fried shrimp, green bean, and curry/chili thing. The flavor was very mediocre. By that I mean, how the hell do you make something with curry and chili bland?  The papaya salad was not very good - too much lime juice, and a bit of an off taste.  We both woke up the next morning with stomach aches. Coincidence? I don't know. But I probably won't be back, either."}
{"text":"Recommended by a neighbor. We LOVE Thai so we ordered pick up (school night). Food was good, not amazing, and priced well. Drunken noodles were nice and spicy, Broccoli Beef, bland flavor, Sweet Sour Chicken was crispy with assorted vegs. Best item was Crab Wantons.....yummy! Will eat there again..."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are good! The garlic chicken/pork, bbq chicken and pad woon sen noodles are to die for. Get them medium spice!"}
{"text":"The best Thai in AZ ! They even accommodate for vegans. Had the tom yum, panang curry, and yellow curry vegan. The pineapple fried rice, paw see ew had chicken and shrimp. The curry and tom yum was the best we've ever had so delicious. The service is great 5  all around"}
{"text":"You can't beat the lunch deals.  15 different options and they are all good.  Most are $6.25 as of this review.  The lunch specials come with a really yummy chicken soup with ginger and a egg roll.   Both are good.  It is sometimes tough to get a group of 6 or more a table at peak lunch time (11:45).  If you have a big group get there by 11:15 or come after 12:15.  I haven't been there for dinner."}
{"text":"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!  I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.  The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.  I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.  Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.  About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.    Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!  On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.  For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason that I dont rate it 5 stars is because the service can be a little slow. But the food is absolutely AMAZING! I have tasted a lot of Thai around the valley and this is by far the best. Their garlic chicken is the best and I could eat the sauce by it self. I highly recommend this restaurant to any thai food fans!"}
{"text":"Customers beware! Dined at Thai Rama tonight. After paying with my credit card, there was a 3% credit card fee added. I was not told this when I presented my card. Bad business! I won't be back because of this!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. My first time was \"dine in\" and the atmosphere is very cozy and classy. The staff is extraordinarily nice. The price is very decent for the portion you recieve. And the wait time is very minimal. I will definitely be returning. Plus I've already recommend this place to multiple people!"}
{"text":"Good food not the best ambiance tho. Ok to grab a beer maybe while they make your food."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Everything comes out great and the service is awesome. They make my food the way I order it and it comes out in a timely manner. I also take advantage of their order out and pickup window. I've become a regular here (meaning 2-4 times a month) and they know exactly what I order and I don't even have to restate my specifications, which is great!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants and Thai Rama is exceptional!  10 Stars from me!  I have been eating here for years and they are always consistent and yummy!  The wait staff are wonderful and the feel of the restaurant is nice and calming!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review about my experience and food in Thai Rama. It was yummy.   http://itsmesteph.com"}
{"text":"Very good food, and great service! I had the cashew chicken and it was awesome, not too hot but spicy!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to eat something spicy for lunch, so she said let's hit some local Thai.  We had never eaten Thai in the East Valley, so we went onto Yelp and read some of the reviews.  This restaurant is very close to my office, so we decided to give it a shot.  Service was so-so, but it was a lunch crowd, so I think they were doing the best they could.  Our order was taken after a bit of delay, but our food came out in decent time afterward.  We both had Pad Thai noodles on the lunch menu, which came with a small soup, some fried wonton skins, and an egg roll.  Have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The noodles were exceedingly tasty.  We set the heat at \"medium\" but probably should've bumped it up a tad.  However, at medium it allowed us to savor the flavor.  For the two of us, the bill was $15 (we had water), so it was extremely inexpensive, and there was plenty of food.  Quite happy, we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The BEST thai food place in the valley. I've been to other resteraunts and NONE of them even come close. Our favorite it the Tom Kah soup with chicken with rice. However, we also have had other dishes. We have never had a bad item. The staff is also amazing with frequent check ins and always in a good mood."}
{"text":"I've got a serious lack of Thai food in my area, so it's always a nice treat to come here. We do lunch here at least once when I'm in town.  Good quality Thai staples here - I almost always go with the basil chicken - and you do get the option of naming your spice level. The heat levels are just about right, but I never quite push it to the limits. Plates are a good size for the money, and everything I've had or tried has been worth it.  They are closed on the king's birthday, so that's a big plus on the authentic Thai scale."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Thai restaurants in the valley, but Thai Rama has become my go-to Thai. They have delicious food and the restaurant is really nicely decorated as well. My favorite dishes are the dumplings, which come topped with crispy garlic and cilantro, the wonton soup, which arrives in a flaming silver bowl, and the garlic chicken, which has good flavor and a kick when ordered medium spicy. The restaurant is open later than a lot of others in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Thai food!! We have been going here for years and love the  authentic Thai food. It ruined us for other Thai places. Our favorite is the garlic chicken and also the eggplant dish. I have never had anything I didn't like. Service is friendly and they remember us and our order every time we visit."}
{"text":"Place is amazing if you like spicy get the 66. People are so nice I love it a must go"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, and when I asked for a water to go cause the food was spicy and I was in a rush, the server wouldn't give it to me. Food was great, service not so much. I don't understand the reasoning behind the server not giving me water, but it would've been 4 stars without that incident."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the Phoenix valley. Never had a bad experience here.  Every dish I've tried has been great,  the prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. I always have leftovers to take home.  My recommendations are the Mussaman curry, the Phad Thai and wash it all down with a Thai tea. For desert? The mango sticky rice.  I think I'm going to have to go here for lunch today."}
{"text":"You can't beat the lunch specials here.  For just about $7 you will get your entree, rice, spring roll, wonton crisps and soup!   I of course got the red curry with tofu. The curry was wonderfully thick and creamy, almost velvety, and even though it only had green beans and bamboo shoots I loved it! I've never experienced that consistency before.   So far marking very high on my list of favorites!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has 4 stars, didn't like it one bit. Pad Thai was tasteless, I ordered some rolls which never got put in, so we never got them. Too many servers for our table, which I'm sure was the mix up for the egg rolls. I'll rather spend my money somewhere delicious with good service.."}
{"text":"I am a very picky Thai food fan. I love this place. Authentic, spicy, and very flavorful. They have one of the best chicken panag dishes I have ever had."}
{"text":"I love this place. 5 years ago I use to come here for lunch and for dinner, but I had moved to a different state and I sure did miss me some Thai food from Thai Rama. I moved back to Arizona back in September and when I got the chance, I went back to grub on some delicious Thai food at Thai Rama. I sure did miss their food. Pad Thai was amazing, their chicken satay was SOOOO good. Everything was amazing. It how I remembered it being, so flavorful...so YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"A local staple, maybe not the best in the Valley but its a great place. The service is friendly and you can clearly tell that they recognize their regulars! Have no fear though, they're just as courteous to new customers. They offer plenty of parking and accept take out orders.  Now for the food: they give generous portions at a low cost. Their fried rice comes in many styles with many meat options, I've had both the chicken and the pork and can say they're quite good. They also offer a large selection of curries, though my boyfriend has yet to find one that he likes. As far as heat levels go, this place definitely caters more to those with a more delecate palate. Even my usual go to of a level 3 was more sweet than it was spicy, and my boyfriend's level five was way more what I would consider a 3.   So it is a great place if you're more into Thai without all the heat, and they're even open on Sundays unlike most Thai restaruants in the Valley. The service is great and the portions are hardy, if the taste was more authentic then they would definitely be 5 stars."}
{"text":"this place has been here a while. i don't like the decor inside. the food is ok."}
{"text":"Went once, didn't go back. Food was decent, but not the best Thai we've had here in Phx. Dirty bathroom, table and booth."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Food is delicious and service is quick and friendly. Some favorite dishes are the tom kha soup, chicken Panang, and yellow curry. The portions are large enough to share and are customizable with your choice of meat and spice level.   I would give this restaurant 5 stars, except they NEVER answer their phone. Many times my husband and I have called to order dinner (to go) and the phone just rings off the hook! Very aggravating! We would order out more often if they had a reliable to-go system.   Other than that, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Never anything too bad, but not that great, either. Ordered red curry take out tonight (substituted broccoli for green beans) and it was almost entirely bamboo shoots. I mean, it was so bad I still have this chemical taste in my mouth, which I assume is from the bamboo?  Tasted nothing like red curry at all. Sitting here wondering if I've been poisoned after reading about the insect problems at this location. 3 pieces of broccoli. I mean, this was terrible. I plan on calling tomorrow for a refund and returning the remaining portion and asking the manager, or whomever, to taste. If I'm still alive!  So disappointing as I was craving red curry tonight.  I see another reviewer experienced the same thing with the red curry and abundance of bamboo shoots. What a terrible, terrible meal."}
{"text":"I visit this place at least twice a month and have done so for the past 12 years. The food is amazing and the staff are always friendly and helpful. They always seem to have good specials too. They also have different levels of spice and a good beer selection. My favorite is the #23 Garlic Chicken mild. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Luv luv luv! Phat Thai is good!"}
{"text":"Have a hankering to eat meat from sticks and don't want to visit the county fair? Thai Rama is your place.  Of course I am speaking of the chicken satay. Very good with some peanut sauce. I haven't had a whole lot of exposure to Thai restaurants but the few times I have been here, I haven't been disappointed.  The menu offers many interesting dishes including a soup served in a flaming bundt cake pan (OK so it isn't actually a bundt cake pan, but  I like to imagine it is). The soup is absolutely delicious, just don't eat the wood floating in it. For seasoning only. You can eat it if you want, just don't come crying to me when you have a mouth full of splinters.   I tried a coconut curry stew with chicken and potatoes. I couldn't stop eating it even after I was full. An incredible dish available in varying degrees of spiciness.  Might I also suggest you try an iced coffee? I'd have it with or for dessert though. It's so sweet and strong and good that I swore I could almost see through walls when I finished it.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and I would recommend Thai Rama to anyone. Even you... I guess."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Phoenix if you're a fan of Gai Tohm Khah (chicken soup with coconut milk - also commonly called Tom Kha Gai). Thai Rama makes a truly top shelf version of this delectable soup - you will savor at least seven discrete, wonderful flavors at once with every spoonful, including galanga, kaffir lime, cilantro, lemongrass, coconut, fresh chicken, and mushrooms. They make it from scratch in the traditional manner and you can really taste the difference.  Also worthy of note: the angel wings are crispy and delicious, and the Panang Curry has a beautiful flavor. Great service here as well.  Although we continue to try other Thai restaurants in the Valley, we always return to Thai Rama in Phoenix for the soup - no one else gets it quite right.   The only downside is that the Tempe location is not as good. Not sure why, but the food is noticeably different. It's a shame they do not have the full bar at the Camelback location, as that would make the restaurant perfect."}
{"text":"Ok, so when I'm not eating cheese pizzas I'm eating Thai Food.  Much like pizza, Thai (or almost any Asian cuisine)  is something I could eat almost everyday and being a vegetarian Thai food has a lot of options for me.  Why am I telling you this?  Cause eating a lot of Thai food makes me picky.    Whenever I try any new Thai place I stick with one of two standards: Pad Thai or Green Curry.  If you are a Thai restaurant and cannot handle either of these dishes, then you should just close down shop now.  As for Thai Rama, they do both very well.  I'll even go as far as to say Thai Rama is my favorite Thai food in the valley.  It's near my home, open late and the staff is really friendly.    I've eaten here for years and my favorite is the Pad Thai with fried tofu....dare I say the best in the valley??  I prefer my Pad Thai a little on the sweet side, not fishy tasting with some flavor, and most Thai places here have the more \"traditional\" type.  If you like it spicy, this place can comply so watch out!  Their green veggie curry is flavorful, with a good assortment of veggies.    My only complaints would be their hot and sour soup, which is ok but WAY too much ginger flavor...to the point that I couldn't enjoy it.  Also, like so many other Thai places, they tempt you with the mango sticky rice only to never have mango!!!  When they do, its awesome, otherwise settle for the custard sticky rice which is almost as good."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. I've been coming here for 20+yrs. Everything I've tried is delicious. I especially like the Spicey Stirfried Squid. Must try!"}
{"text":"I've had better & from here too. :P Thai Rama is going to hell in a hand basket.   So depressing all my old haunts are closing or serving up hot crap on a platter!   I am not a Thai connoisseur by any means trust. But I do enjoy a good Pad Thai every now and again. I went here a couple weeks ago with my Sis.  She got her Hot and Sour soup and for me Pad Thai. My mouth was watering just thinking about it.   Then it happened.... me so stupid brings me something that I did not order & didn't even come close to Pad Thai WTF??!!?? Wrong table. But maybe I should have kept it because what came next was unacceptable.  It looked tasty, smelled tasty but my tasty buds had to spit it out!  1st it was so hot I thought the cook (I do mean cook and not chef) from Ls Dos Molinos was moonlighting at Thai Rama. Holy Peppers batman this shit was hot! But served at room temperature go figure. The noodles were wayyyyyy over cooked they were paste and I am an al dente kinda girl. Al dente you know firm but tender anyway...  Off with you heads! They took it away and tried again, to my dismay I received a now flavorless dish with similar noodles. I think they made them in advance and are fishing them out as people ordered. BLUCK! PLTH wiping my tongue off.   Anyway this is not as I remember and I don't think I will go back unless someone else is buying. Tee Hee I only gave it a 3 star because my sis said her soup was delish as always. Again maybe the cook from Los is following me."}
{"text":"The food here tastes pretty good although I haven't had enough thai food to judge between good and great. My friends and I all got pad thai during lunch and some said that the medium and mild was a little to spicy for them. The beef in my pad thai seemed slightly overcooked since it wasn't overly tender but it was still pretty good regardless. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Thai restaurants in Arizona.  Their Pa Nang Curry is addictive and I have to have it 3x a month.  The restaurant is generally busy and the wait staff is a little slow, but they consistently make good food and are priced very reasonably."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here, that's why I went back and originally gave them 4 stars.  My most recent visit, the place was packed, I only had 40 minutes to eat.  Placed a small appetizer order and after waiting for 25 minutes they finally told me they were out of what I ordered.  Great food, poor service when busy."}
{"text":"This place has some delicious food!   I've been coming for years here and i love it.   The only thing is that their hours of operation are \"weird\" so it gets pretty busy after work hours. Because its so busy and sometimes they only have 2 waitresses, the service time is bad. I would just suggest adding on more help."}
{"text":"Yeah, my previous posts are accurate: these guys and gals are VERY INCONSISTENT.  NEVER THE SAME AMOUNT OF HEAT.  NEVER!  These guys are either very savvy or they just hate me.  Either way, I'm not going back and that's a shame because the food is pretty good.  I order one particular chicken curry dish and I've ordered it at least 50 times over the past 3 years.  Every time it's a crap-shoot how hot they're gonna make it.  I tried the \"stars\" system.  One night, it's 5 stars; next time, 10 stars.  And the bitch of it is, neither 5 stars or 10 stars was very hot at all.  Last night I get this broad on the phone, and she says, \"how hot?\"  I say, \"hot\".  She say, \"hot-hot-hot?\", and I agree.  This, after 50 FRIGGING TRIPS TO THE TROUGH, and IT'S TWICE AS HOT AS EVER!  Passive-aggressive?  Douchebaginess?  I dunno.  I do know that Thai food is almost as common as McDonald's.  I'll just move on down the road.  Go if you like, I didn't."}
{"text":"Lunch portions are extremely small..for almost $8.50 , there is barely anything .. These guys need to understand these are adult servings and at least need to have enough food for $8.50.  11/01 Ordered Masaman curry..ended up getting a combination of boiled water , little coconut milk and steamed veggies.. Chef..have some conscience.. For $11, atleast add some spices and salt to the boiled water and coconut milk..Ridiculous quality.. Other two curries were good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed.the food but stopped going there after they refused a soda refills because my wife a taken a couple of sips.   Discovered Curry Corner just a few blocks away and never looked back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the East Valley!! Customer service is not the best but the food makes up for it. Best Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles!!"}
{"text":"i am not huge fan of thai food.. but my friend wanted to try \"thai rama\".. well it exceeded my expectation!    flavor was intense!!  service was not the best.. but good enough for me to come back for more..   i will write more review once i revisit the place.."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I caught them on one of those days, but my first(and only) experience here was less than memorable.  I decided to give these guys a shot after my first choice was closed(it was a Sunday).  I found them on Yelp, and it said that they were open.  I tried the phone number that was listed several times, but all I got was a busy signal.  Since I was leaving work, I didn't have time to try and find another place, and this place was on the way, so I figured I'd see if they were in fact open like Yelp said.  The place was easy to find, on Chandler just west of Dobson.  I saw they had a drive-thru for call-ahead orders.  That'd be great if you could actually get through on the phone.  They were definitely open, so I walked in to place my order for take-out.  The inside was actually pretty nice looking.   It was nicely decorated.  Not overly done, the lighting was down a little, and it made for a comfortable atmosphere.  Not very noisy either.  Seemed like a nice little place to come and sit for a meal.  They were very quick to greet me and to take my order.  It was a simple order, as I ordered chicken paht thai, medium spiciness, and a couple egg rolls.  If you can get through on the phone, I highly recommend ordering ahead.  I felt a bit awkward standing around, with no place for those waiting on take-out to sit.  I ended up leaning against a small counter in the corner of the restaurant because there was no place to wait.  I guess you could have sat at one of their dining tables, but that's not my style.  The food was fairly quick.  Less than ten minutes and I was out the door.  Smelled great too.  When I got home, I quickly sat down with my wife, dished up a plate, and dug in.  The egg rolls were actually really good.  They were a bit smaller than what I expect egg rolls to be, but they still had good flavor.  The paht thai is where things went south pretty quick.  My wife and I love paht thai, and this is what we get all the time.  We just moved to Arizona, so we are trying to find a place that nails it down.  This wasn't it.  Let me start by saying the spiciness was right on.  It wasn't too spicy, but it still gave a slight burn.  Pretty right on for \"medium\".  That's all it had going though.  Overall it was very flavorless.  I was very disappointed with each bite I took, as I expected it to get better.  Unfortunately it never did.  Even at the very end, I grabbed a piece of chicken and ate it.  It too was absolutely flavorless and dry.  I would never order paht thai from here again.  Seeing a lot of positive reviews on here makes me think I ordered the wrong thing, however paht thai seems to be a pretty easy and common dish at Thai restaurants.  If they can't nail that down, it leaves me with little or no hope for the rest of the menu.  Plus, at $14 something for that and 3 tiny egg rolls, I expect a hell of a lot more."}
{"text":"I love the Paht Thai and Yellow curry. The service is great and it's one of my favorite Thai places."}
{"text":"The people here are extremely friendly and the food is so damn good. My favorite dish is the beef and broccoli"}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven by this place on numerous occasions and never given it any thought. The place looks very small and nondescript from the outside. There is a small parking lot, which might be a problem, should a lot of people show up. However, when we went, it was just around 1:30pm on a Friday and the parking lot was empty. (They close at 2pm.) Our party of four arrived just in time to grab lunch. I ordered the pad thai and my husband ordered the red curry. Our other two party members ordered the yellow curry, the larb, Tom Kha Gai soup, and some sort of kebab. The soup was amazing. Super flavorful and I would definitely order it again. I liked my pad thai, which comes with both shrimp and chicken, but I only had one shrimp in the entire dish. (It was mainly chicken.) My husband loved his curry and said it was the best curry he's ever eaten. Prior to our lunch being served, complimentary cabbage soup was served. Overall, the entire meal was very good. Our waitress was very nice, double checked our orders, and was very attentive. The inside seems decently decorated and had comfy booths. The bathroom needs improvement, but it was clean."}
{"text":"I've eaten in here a few times, but most of my experience with this place is through take out.  I am a sucker for good panang curry and that will keep me coming back to this place on a regular basis!  Wow, if these guys delivered I would be in serious trouble!"}
{"text":"Had takeout from Thai Rama CHandler this past weekend. Their Chicken Panang is delicious. And gluten free! As is their Pad Thai! I was tickled to get yummy gluten free food from a restaurant.  I've had food from here multiple times. It's always good!  And the gentleman who helped me and my 20 questions (about what is gluten free and what's not) was very patient and helpful."}
{"text":"The food is salty and made it inedible!!! The service is selectively nice to some people but was really rude to my table. I was just fed up and didn't bother anymore, but they charged me a \"fee\" to use my card!!! Definitely don't go here. There's plenty of other Thai restaurants that have good food and are nice, without charging a card fee!!!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to go to this spot for some time now... I went for lunch and entered to an empty restaurant it seemed to be a trend for me... I was seated right away and was greeted with a smile from my server very helpful as well... I ended up going with the Panang Curry with beef lunch combo... I rate the experience as followed.  Panang Curry with beef - B Staff - A  It was a good meal but it was not spicy enough for me... I would say this spot is very much like Thai Basil so you're in the area it's worth the stop."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Chandler.  The lunch specials are a really good. But, I have enjoyed everything I have ordered anytime I have eaten here. The ambiance is nice too.  Service can be a bit slow, but I typically don't mind because the food is always good."}
{"text":"I never would've thought that over a year later I would be coming back to update my Thai Rama review, but I feel it needs to be said. Especially after visiting another Thai restaurant in the area last night and realizing it doesn't even come close in comparison.   From what I recall, the spice I recall from earlier visits was good but nothing spectacular and the dessert was fabulous. Since then, I've been a crazy regular at Thai Rama and it never fails, I'm craving their Thai specifically at least once a week. Usually for yellow chicken curry.  The prices are very reasonable and the dinner portion is enough to last me at least two meals. AT LEAST. The curry containers are a really sturdy plastic, which means they not only stay safe on the drive home, but they are reusable and recyclable.  And the heat people. Wow. Let me tell you, that it's on point. And then some. The heat is perfect. I am pretty tolerant, and love, a good amount of heat in my food. And medium here is usually the most I can handle. Any more, and I'm buying a gallon of milk for the meal too.  To Go orders are pretty quick, which is convenient and the staff is so friendly. I'm always offered water and a seat while I'm waiting.   This is on my permanent take out rotation!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The egg rolls and potstickers are the perfect appetizers. The staff is always so nice and helpful with making suggestions on what to order."}
{"text":"The curries are very good. I was impressed with the pa-nang curry more so than the pineapple curry. Has a bit more flavor and more meat. Could have just been the evening that we got it, but that was my experience.  The spring rolls are not particularly worth it because it's basically a salad in a rice noodle. It leaves something to be desired, certainly.  As far as the pad thai. I am typically a very big fan of Pad Thai, unfortunately the first time we tried it, it tasted and looked as though it had been cooked much earlier in the day. Even when we got it a second time and it was fresh the taste was ho-hum. I would stick to the curry.  The staff is kind and friendly as well as prompt. We ordered take out twice and I think they have a drive-through window. I would take an extra 5 minutes on top of what they tell you, but the food has typically been done in less than 30 minutes even when ordering at peak hours."}
{"text":"Not sure about the negative comments on here,  but I've always had a great experience and so have my numerous friends who are loyal patrons of this favorite neighborhood restaurant!  The place is very clean,  the waiters are friendly,  and the food is DELISH. We come here so Much and order so much from them that the staff knows and remembers us even when I call in for take out!  I'm greeted with a hi,  how are you? And how are your kids? You can't really beat that."}
{"text":"I like Thai Rama.  I was tempted to give it 3 stars because I've had a lot of Thai food in the Bay Area and I've been to Thailand once, and I'm honestly not sure where I should come down on that fourth star, but since Phoenix doesn't really have quite the selection of Thai restaurants, I'll err on the side of arroy (Thai for \"delicious\").  I've had a few different dishes there, and they tended to be quite tasty without being Americanized.  That is, the flavors were there and not damped down for our native taste buds.    Some how we always ended up getting some yellow curry in there (one of my favorites in general), and this was just fine there.  The ambiance is pleasant and the people working there were always very nice.  I've always said that Thai people are the Italians of SE Asia in the way they enjoy food and family, and here they seem to be happy to share their culture with all comers."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Thai Rama!  They know us by name as we have been coming here for years.  The food is to die for. Customer service is wonderful. Prices are just right.  Favorite dishes are Paht Prig Sohd, Paht Graphrao, Gai Mauang Himaphan, Yellow Curry, Massaman Curry, Mango Delight and Fried rice!  Their angel wings are to die for :)  I just recently discovered a new dish thanks to Panee for recommending the Gratiam Prig Thai, the spicy garlic is a wonderful flavor for this dish :)"}
{"text":"Fianc√© and I randomly went here for dinner. I got the mango kingh curry and pineapple (I think that's what it was called) with tofu. I had them make it mild and oh mylanta it was UH-MAZING!!!!!! We also got the crab puffs (we are crab puff snobs) and these were some of the best crab puffs both of us have ever had. The cream cheese filling was fresh and definitely higher quality. I can't remember what the Fianc√© got, but he was very happy with it. The service was of course amazing and the restaurant was super clean! Looks like we have a new favorite dining spot to add to the list!"}
{"text":"Always good! I love  the tom Lang soup and the green curry.  Lettuce wraps are another favorite. I wish I could go there more except my husband doesn't care for Thai food so that makes it pretty hard to get him to go."}
{"text":"YUM!!!!!  This is one of my favorite Thai places - especially at lunch! My whole company (4 people) can eat here for like $30!   The pad Thai lunch special is insanely tasty and leaves me full for the rest of my work day. If you like Thai, give this little place a go!"}
{"text":"The phat prik king curry was ok. But I got another cold egg roll ! And the cucumber salad was not good. It didn't taste pickled. Not enough rice vinegar, too much corn syrup.   It's hard to believe this used to be one of my favorite Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for 4 years. One of our first dates was at Thai Rama and we still consistently go on date nights here. Not much has changed since our first visit.  Always great service and delicious food. My wife always gets Evil Jungle Princess curry and I have tried just about everything on the menu. We definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"My favorite is Evil jungle Princess curry. The vegetables are never overcooked, always fresh, and full of flavor! I've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.  The food is always excellent  and the staff very friendly.  I love their  coconut -chicken soup. Its taste is so unique, it's that perfect thai balance of savory and sweet. For my main entr√©e  i usually get one of the curries - they are all faboulous. If your new to thai id recommend the panang. Sometimes i'll get the bbq chicken which is hands down the most delicious  bbq ive ever had. Its sweet and tangy. And you get a half chicken. The price is inexpensive  with each dish costing around $7. I highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love the food here at Thai Rama, but it's been awhile since I ate here.  Everything I've ever had here was very delicious.  However, it's far from where we live and not so convenient to dine here.  Periodically I have come here with my extended family and food is good, but service is so-so.    Although this is bad to say, I think if you're really Asian and going more to an Asian restaurant, although this does have an American flair to it, we don't tend to get great service.  Not sure why that is, but maybe it's a part of the culture.  Maybe if we were a bunch of white folks, we'd get better service, but then, maybe the food would taste different.  Authentic Asian food tastes better than the Americanized versions.  Thai Rama is like 50/50 and that's fine with me.  The Asian population is very spread out in the Phx area, so it's hard to do super authentic Asian (whether it's Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese or whatever) because most likely most of your customers will be more accustomed and want the American taste of Asian food, so I don't blame them.  Thai Rama is about my favorite Thai place and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Completely awesome.  My husband and I were driving through and we stopped.  The parking lot was kind of dark and it was one of those deals where you eye people around you suspiciously - especially the two meth looking dudes that I saw coming out, but once inside it was really a family type establishment - making the two white trashers an aberration.  Ok, let's get to the food.  I ordered Tom Khai Gai and at first I was taken aback, because I saw american mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms, which is usually a bad sign - but it was fantastic.  The chicken was really good - not the strange consistency that can be found at other restaurants that serve the dish."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent and very flavorful. Just the right amount of spice in everything. Highly recommend the Papaya salad and curry. Service was great. Glad to have found a good Thai restaurant in the east valley! Our kiddo enjoyed the egg rolls and squid appetizer.  Atmosphere is good as well."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the staff is friendly and quick. It's a nice calm atmosphere.   You should totally get the mango delight :) yummz to the 10th power."}
{"text":"I tried the Chicken Pad thai. It was ok- But was light on the chicken."}
{"text":"I've been to the phoenix Thai Rama several times, but since I've moved this location is closer to home. I've never eaten inside, only done take out. Both locations are awesome!  I always get the  Tohm Kah soup and Kattiam Pik Thai, both chicken, and very mild cause I'm a whimp. My girlfriend gets the Paht Priaw Wahn, which she loves. Its not that we don't want to try other items on the menu, but these are so amazing its hard to try anything else.   The soup is this strange buttery coconut mix that sounds like it wouldn't be good, but after the first time you try it, you'll start craving it, its an addiction. The Kattiam Pik Thai chicken is juicy, and the portions are overly generous, same as the soup. The sweet and sour paht priaw wahn with chicken is to quote my girlfriend \"its delicious yummy and tasty, the chickens good, the sauce is good\" shes eloquent, lol. But getting her to love a food other than cheeseburgers is amazing, so this must be pretty damn good.   Theres a little drive up window just like a drive through, and its great, don't have to wait inside all awkward, but careful, the food is so hot it sometimes melts through the styrofoam containers!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was not tasty. It appears that they use spice to conceal food taste. Was my second time eating there and both were mediocre. There are better thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Crap.  Poop. Turd. Fecal matter. Feces. Stool. Thai Rama. Above are all the synonyms I know for the term \"shit\"."}
{"text":"The customer service is the worst. Both when your actually at the place or not. I was on the phone trying for almost an hour to place a to go order but it seems like they don't even bother. The only reason why I still return is that the food is good and it's closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Cute and very friendly mom and pop Thai restaurant! Hot and spicy shrimp soup is a must!!"}
{"text":"This place is always on point... great service and great food. Doesn't matter what we order - it comes out hot and very tasty! This is worth the drive across town for Thai food."}
{"text":"great pad Thai. Food is very good and will satisfy the authentic Thai food you crave."}
{"text":"Great service all the time.  Never waiting too long. Lunch specials are awesome and everyone seems to know my regular order now Bc I come so often during lunch!   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing Tom yum soup,best I've had and I've alot all over America. Great staff very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend,we will definitely be back. The curry is also amazing . Make this your next eat out spot . You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have found in the East Valley!  Great staff, great decor and atmosphere, very reasonable prices, convenient, and fast service.  The spices and textures of their food is just right.  Lots to choose from and has good lunch specials too.  All the hip Thai places I've been to in Tempe and Gilbert don't compare.  My favorite is the Mamuang Himapan (#25) and the Tohm Kah soup which has a really cool presentation too!  Would suggest for dates, family night, special occasion, anything.  Love Thai Rama in Chandler all around!"}
{"text":"I tried the Pad-Thai.  Not that great.  The sauce was...somewhat bitter and past that it didn't get any better.  Noodles were cooked well, so was the beef and the brocolli.  Its just the sauce was bad.  Price was ok.  I mean, I didn't order from the lunch menu so it was around 9 bucks or so.  But the portion was nice, really nice in fact.    I really was hoping for a better dish.  Perhaps I need to try something they are more known for, like one of their curries.    Service was good.  Friendly when they took my order and when they gave me my food.    I guess I just need to try a different dish.  But pad-thai is one of my favorites and they didn't get it right.  Oh well.  Their curry reputation is reason to go back.  Hopefully an updated awaits."}
{"text":"this place is really good! we have tried many thai places in the chandler and this one is our favorite! they are very good service is very nice but sometimes takes a little long to get your food but over all SUPER! Yummy totally recommend"}
{"text":"Thai Rama was decent. I shared a pineapple curry and a pineapple fried rice with a friend for lunch. The curry itself had good flavor with a lot of vegetables and base protein (Tofu, $9.95). I was slightly disappointed that the vegetables were your standard peas and cubed carrot mixture bought from the freezer section though. The pineapple fried rice was excellent. It had deep, complex flavors that complimented the spiciness of the dish (Medium), and the sweetness from the pineapple.   Dessert was great. We had the mango sticky rice. The fresh mango, coconut sauce, and slightly sweet rice meshed well together.  Service was attentive and friendly.  While the decor for the most part is nice, we were seated at a table with duct-taped seats. Kind of a minor point, but it puts a damper on your dining experience when you are sitting on tape!"}
{"text":"5 stars, but only for the excellent tea, noodle soup, and dessert. I don't care for the other dishes, and I've tried many. But what I do like I can't find better at other places. Get their delicious hot tea. It's not bitter at all but if you like it sweeter with cream in it, get the thai iced tea. The noodle soup is not oily american noodle soup. It's real chicken broth with some tasty spices in it. My favorite dish here. I usually get it hot but if I'm stuffed up I get it \"thai hot\". I'm not crazy about their other dishes I've tried so now I just get this one. Every. Single. Time. I also recommend the mango and sticky rice for dessert on occasion."}
{"text":"Walked in...was able to order the lunch special...got our miso soup and the bowls the soup were in were completely filthy. Gunk crusted on the outside of both of our bowls. We told the sever and he made excuses. We canceled our order and left. Oh and this place doesn't know what air conditioning is apparently."}
{"text":"Food is great. I love the evil jungle noodles. I'm only giving it 3 stars though because several times when I've tried to call in an order after 5pm, nobody answers. I guess that's because they are busy, but they really should have someone available to answer the phones."}
{"text":"Here is the thing, I absolutely love the food here. My grandpa and I used to come here for lunch all the time when he was alive. Customer service when you actually go inside the restaurant to sit and eat is good. Take out on the other hand is horrible. They don't answer their phones.... EVER! You would think they would since they even have a drive thru for you to pick up your take out but since you can't even call to make an order, it's useless.  Every few months I when I get a craving for Thai food I try to call but they never pick up. I think in he past 2 years I was successful one time after spam calling them for 10 minutes straight. Then when I drove through the drive thru to pick up my order, they didn't come to the window for at least 7 minutes. I was about to just call it quits and just park to get my food but just as I was about to leave once opened the window. If they actually answered their phones for take out I'd rate this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Every time I want to order from Thai Rama, no one answers the phone... So I've been frequenting other Thai places. The food here is decent, but the chicken used in the curries is not very good. I normally order beef from here for that reason. The drive thru is great for pickup orders if you can get someone to take a phone order in the first place, and I love the Thai iced tea (large to-go)."}
{"text":"Just so everyone knows, when you order pad thai with medium spicy, be prepared to drink an entire gallon of milk with your order. I've never had anything so hot before. My boyfriend, who loves Thai Spicy, couldn't even stomach his order of medium spice pad thai either. Maybe I'll order NO spice next time. If we go back."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was also excellent. A lot of their food comes with their hot and sour sauce and if you're not a fan of spicy food then I would suggest to stray away from that. But overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"As you know,  i'm spoiled by living in the Bay Area and Tokyo. I've had amazing food and its not always expensive, usually not. I just expect quality and care in any dish.  I was craving Thai food and went to Thai Rama  on a recommendation based on dinner my sister had there 3 years ago. I always order Thai Beef Salad at a new Thai spot...sort of a litmus test. It wasn't my favorite.   Loads of onions, no tomato and no cucumber and no mint. The spice level was nice, good flavor. The beef was way over cooked and far from the medium rare juicy I expect.  I'm not sure I will be back"}
{"text":"Located in the location of the old restaurant Char's - which was one of the best Thai restaurants in the valley -  I had high hopes for Thai Rama.    The remodeled restaurant is bright and open, though a little generic.  It's modern lighting and plush bench seating could easily be found in a martini bar.  Besides the display at the front of the restaurant, there is little in the space to make it look or feel like a Thai restaurant.    The service was prompt and friendly, with the exception of the older lady, who may have been the manager or the owner.  She seemed annoyed that we needed extra time to look over the menu.    The dishes we ordered were the Panang Curry with Chicken and the Moo Daeng (Thai Barbecue pork).  The curry was good, but it was very heavy on the lemongrass.  More of a lemon grass curry with peanut flavor, than the other way around.  The Moo Daeng was, in a word, terrible.  It reminded me more of a Lean Cuisine frozen meal than something I'd order at a restaurant.  The meat was fairly dry, with no signs of barbecuing,and it was covered in a fairly bland, sweet glaze.  I'll definitely give them another try.  Still, it's sad to see a great, if somewhat quirky restaurant, replaced by a more modern and generic one."}
{"text":"The best Thai in chandler by FAR! the jungle noodles will blow your mind but they are rich. great prices too!"}
{"text":"I wonder if Thai Rama's management team knows that they take the phone off the hook and set it on the counter during busy hours. This leads me to believe that they may be understaffed. And maybe they're missing a lot of business. I was on hold for about 10 minutes I was told that they would be back in a second or two. The guy never came back. After 10 minutes I hung up and called again. Busy signal. No surprise. Easy way to lose customers for life."}
{"text":"Worst service and really really shitty host ... I have never experienced a rude host like the guy here in the  United States ! I wish I had the option to rate 0 /5 ..    We were at the restaurant at 9:45 for a restaurant that closes at 10:30 pm . He was wishy washy about letting us dine , but he let us dine in .. We would have appreciated if he had denied service but he resorted to impolite service which cannot be tolerated . I had to ask the server for every freaking item , including silverware , napkins , plate , fork one after the other.. I was startled when he flinged plate on the table..   The food was way below average and it was gross .. I returned back home empty stomach and the price was not worth it .. Pretty much wrecked our Friday night dining ..  Please even refrain from the idea of dining at this place if you'd like to avoid embarrassing yourself"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time and ordered to go. The wait was less then 15 min after ordering. I ordered a chicken and green bean with a red curry sauce, with an order of spring rolls. Everything was really good! They give you a really big portion of rice, and a pretty big portion of the main entree. I would definitely  go back to try something new!"}
{"text":"We love the food at Thai Rama. Soup with coconut milk great. Yellow curry so good. Tempura dishes good. And we already know the customer service is not always good. When busy Thai Rama seems under staffed. We just deal with it cause we live close and love the food. But here is my main complaint and this is something all restaurants need to think about when it comes to cleaning. Use cleaning chemicals that do not smell. More than once we have been to Thai Rama after 8pm and that is when a staff person decides to clean the restrooms. The strong odor of bleach or whatever is in your products is so strong...way too strong and it ruined our dining experience. Smell is a very important element when it comes to dining."}
{"text":"Love this place! I order the Evil Princess Curry usually & it's so delicious. When I order in for pick up they have it ready. Portions are a good size to. My goto Curry spot"}
{"text":"This small place is easy to miss but worth finding so look hard for it.  The food is always good although the amount of spice in the food depends on who is in the kitchen.   One time I ordered basil fried rice at 2 stars and it was fine, a week later same dish too hot to eat at when ordered with 2 stars.  Next time same dish 2 stars and no spice at all.  I like it but will try Touch of Thai next."}
{"text":"The eggplant was great! The flavor was closed with my hometown tastes (even am from Indonesia :) ). I would like to go back to try other menu!"}
{"text":"Best economical thai fast food. Could improve decor and add more servers at rush time to improve service time. Food is fresh and healthy. Must try"}
{"text":"It's worst experience I have ever had ... The server was so rude since beginning .. He didn't even care to give us spoons .. Only one napkin Fr 3 people.. Food was the worst ever I had in any Thai Restaurant.. It was not cooked properly..I didn't even finish 20% of my plate..He charged us extra for brown rice ..he was so rude to talk ... When we asked Fr separate check he denied ... We asked to share bill among 3 cards .. He denied and was extremely rude .. Throwing our cards on our table ... When we walked out , he angrily closed the door... I would strongly advice you never ever come to this place ...worst food and worst server .....I would rate Zero star"}
{"text":"i walked in today and walked to what looked like the to go counter. I asked the woman if I could place an order to go here. she said sighed loudly then said yes but it was going to be a looong wait. I asked how long. she sighed again and pointed to the line at the front door. I asked her again how long is long. she said 30 min. I asked her even for take out. she proceeded to explain that there is only one kitchen, not two, theres no special kitchen for take out, and that just bc I want take out doesn't mean I get to cut in front of everyone waiting. very disappointed in her communication. I would not be writing this if she would have just said, \"yes, you can order take out here. it'll be about 30 minutes until your food is ready.\" oh, and done without the sighs and condescending tone that made me feel like she was speaking to child."}
{"text":"Went in for a take out (this seems to be a habit with me these days)...  Yellow Curry Chicken with rice Sticky rice & peanut sauce  Fast & friendly service, tasty food, nice atmosphere. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for lunch.   Their special comes with a cup of soup, a small egg roll, some wontons and an entree.   I use yellow curry with chicken as my Thai litmus test.   They spiced it right (I went with extra hot), the flavor was nice, good proportion of chicken, onion, carrot and potato.   My only issue was the consistency of the potatoes, some were slightly underdone."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food place. Love their Coconut Soup and Silver noodles and they make really good Thai tea as well."}
{"text":"Used to really like their mango delight and yellow curry but the last time I went after not being there for a few months, I had the most horrible experience.  No one came to get the order or to give water for 30 minutes, and the soup took another 30 minutes, and that too only after asking for it 5 times.  The food which then came another 30 minutes later had absolutely no taste.  Quantity was significantly less too than before.  I didn't expect an apology for the terrible food, but thought that someone would come say sorry for making us wait so long, but no.  No one cared. Absolute worst dining experience I have ever had.  I haven't checked but Yelp says the restaurant is now closed.  Based on my last experience, I wouldn't be too surprised."}
{"text":"This place is always great!  Service and food were very good.  I had the pad kee Mao which was outstanding.  Cooked perfectly and lots of great flavor.  My husband had the yellow curry which was also very good.  We went on a Friday evening and every table was taken - service was still great and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time.  Will return."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had since Tipp's 88 closed."}
{"text":"I'm done with Thai Rama!!! Today we went for lunch. The lunch menu is scarce on vegetarian options so I ordered from the main menu. Assorted vegetables & tofu in yellow curry. They brought out a green curry dish. Not what I ordered. My husband ordered the chicken & shrimp fried rice. One shrimp came with the dish. One!!!! When he told the owner/manager about it he said that he told my husband it came that way. Wow!! That conversation NEVER took place.   Final straw, he ordered a regular iced tea. The waitress forgot to bring it so he asked the owner/manager for a tea. A few minutes later he brings the tea and five more minutes later she brings a Thai iced tea. My husband does not like cream in his tea and would NOT order it that way, but both beverages appeared on the check. Instead of complaining about a tea we'll simply take our business elsewhere. Thai E San here we come."}
{"text":"Best Thai good I have ever tasted. I usually order the # 6 lunch special extra hot with extra chicken. It is the same as the #24 on the dinner menu. It is the best I have ever tasted. They also have very good soup. My favorite is the chicken with rice soup which is the lunch soup. If you are ever in the area you have to try this place. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place out of all the ones I tried. The sweet and sour chicken was delicious! It was the perfect amount sweet and sour. The Thai basil beef was amazing. You could taste the basil and it was a great amount of spicy! And the last last dish was a beef dish with lots of veggies which was also delicious. The service was great. The prices were great. We were definitely happy. This spot is our pick for good Thai and I'm surprised it doesn't have better reviews."}
{"text":"I will begin this by stating that they need a couple more workers during their peak hours. That being said, this is one of the most incredible Thai places I've been too! It's not in the nicest part of town, sure. The building isn't in perfect condition, and their decor is tacky at best. BUT, they will make you cry and choke and sweat with their truly mind blowing thai hot dishes! The food is devastatingly amazing!   I had pork with vegetables and rice. Nothing spectacular looking but the smells...burn your nostrils, sending signals to your brain that make your forehead glisten before taking a bite. I had the ultimate spicy-dish experience! There were layers to the masochistic heatwave that flooded my brain. I had a feeling of enlightenment from the mind-numbing explosions my taste buds were encountering.   This place has its flaws, yeah sure. But they will not disappoint you with their authentic masterpieces! I love the grub this spot creates!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Thai food you can get in Arizona.  The food is amazing. I have tried several different options here including the hot and sour soup, pad Thai, coconut curry with tofu, a noodle dish with egg and basil and a tofu dish with broccoli. I have never ever been disappointed!  The service is really good and quick, and the prices are right on par.  We used to come here for lunch about once a week when I worked closer, and I used to make a second trip with my roommate at least twice a month.   My old boss used to get a Thai Omelet... so if you are into those, you can ask for a special order!  OH YEAH... I forgot, they have window service so you can actually order take out and never get out of your car! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"I like Thai food. I couldn't tell you what particular dish I like, as my habit is to simply request that they bring me the best dish. I mean, why the hell would I take a stab in the dark. Not like I know how to make it.  I went to TR today for lunch. Being wise, we consulted Yelp and learned that we should get their early. I'm glad we did, as we slid right into a table -- no waiting. 15 minutes later, the house was packed and the line was outside the door. Yet never once did the waitstaff miss a beat.  The food? Very good. We ordered off the lunch menu, which always has a quick-serve air about it. But it was very good. Medium spice was just right, but some day when I'm adventurous, I may go up one level."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place! Perhaps I went on a bad day but I won't be returning.   We went for lunch on Friday. Tables were full which is always a good sign.  We were greeted right away, brought our drinks and lunch soup immediately. Then it went down hill......  After 30 minutes of waiting, I noticed a lot of tables without food.  After waiting 10 more minutes our food finally arrived.   I ordered pan and curry. How can you mess up Panang curry? Easily, there was no vegetables just chicken slices that were a bit dry and tough. I asked the waitress, is this suppose to have vegetables? Her answer, they are cut very small. I dug around my food and I found it!!! Just one and a piece of herb. Not sure if the herb was suppose to be there.    Then it continues down hill....  My husband got the red curry. Oddly it looked like my curry but his had vegetables, score!! He took a bite of his rice. It wasn't cooked all the way!! I'm Asian so we know what rice is suppose to taste like. After trying to make contract with our waitress, we found another one. We told he about the rice and she stared at us like we were crazy then offered my husband another cup of rice.  Maybe it was just a bad day? Maybe lunch time isn't their strength? Still not worth going with the poor food quality."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Tai food and I loved it! I have no idea what I ordered but it was all delicious! Great rice."}
{"text":"Superior taste.  This was one of those occasions when we didn't plan to eat Thai--it just kind of happened.  My wife had to go to the Fedex nearby to get in a copy job for work.  It was in the evening, we were all hungry, and food was on the agenda after Fedex.  I spot Thai Rama on the other side of the parking lot, and the question on what we were going to have for dinner was answered.  Often, Thai fried rices contain very dry meats.  I have always found it sad that you have all these tasty rices and veggies and then the meat sucks the saliva out of your mouth while you are trying to enjoy your meal.  At Thai Rama, the pork in my fried rice was substantially moister. more flavorful, and quite enjoyable.  It was a nice change.  My wife also experienced the better meat quality in her dinner.  The massaman beef she ate had large chunks of meat instead of the usual strips.  She said that they tasted like roast, and were so tender, you could cut the pieces with a fork..  We all left the restaurant with smiles on our faces.  Michelle L. said in a previous review this year that this spot is her \"go-to Thai\".  That's our label now for Thai Rama.  There's LOTS of good Thai out there, but why have good when you can have great?"}
{"text":"my \"place to go\" if I am craving panang curry.  The best in the east valley"}
{"text":"The restaurant staff are extremely friendly and are basically ready to serve you once you walk into the door (there arent many people there...sadness). We ordered and the food came out AFTER the people next to us got theirs even though we ordered first...this may be our hungry stomachs talking but that is unacceptable hhaha jk...but yeah, we were kind of like wtf at the time. The drunken noodles (pad kee mau) was pretty good. a unique sauce and thinner noodles than other thai restaurants. This could be because of the amount of oil they add to it though...look at pic for reference. Otherwise, it was a delicious dish. Green curry was filled with green beans, bamboo shoots, and other vegetables which made me a happy camper. next time, i may stick to the currys just so i dont feel so gross looking at an extremely greasy plate."}
{"text":"Delicious! The lunch specials are amazing and only $7! The white rice was soft, slightly sweet, and delectable. Highly recommend the mango delight, sweet and sour, and the gia yang.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ate with a client here today for the first time. Really enjoyed the yellow curry dish medium and the soup that comes before the meal, but the service was slow. It took 16 minutes for my entree to come, although after it came many employees asked if I wanted a drink refill.  Nice decor and decent prices"}
{"text":"Pretty decent The spicy pad thai was good and so was the pad somh? However the combo fried rice was too peppery.  Overall a  not bad experience and a good contrast to the nearby thai basil."}
{"text":"Got the red curry for lunch. The price was good, and the service was decent. The building looks like a former fastfood restaurant. Unfortunately the curry was bland and over salted. Might try it again because I have some friends who like it, but not in any hurry."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots for thai food.  Their lunch specials are really great. I always get the drunken noodles . I love spicy food, so hot is perfect for me.  The only downfall to this place is the service, I have never gotten great service here it's just okay..."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite Thai food place, ever. I have been coming here for at least 10 years now. Food is consistently fresh, of a higher quality than most other Thai places i have been to out here & they are very vegetarian friendly. Two warnings: if you ask for hot/spicy....it will be some of the spiciest food you have ever had, not a bad thing, just be aware. Second: weekends are extremely busy, dont come on a weekend with the entire restaurant packed full if you expect the staff to take as much time talking to you simply because they can't. Most of the negative reviews i have read have been about these issues so hope this helps for what its worth. Again, I highly recommend this place & always have a good experience here"}
{"text":"This was a nice Thai restaurant.  The service was friendly but not amazingly attentive.  It had a nice selection of Thai goodies.  The flavors of the food were vibrant and delicious.  My biggest complaint was that my order of \"Thai Spicy\" was underwhelming.  The heat was seriously lacking."}
{"text":"So strange!!  Came here and sat down right away. The table settings were unique. It was a royal blue cloth napkin wrapping a fork. I was in a mood for vegetables or a tom yum soup or both! I normally order a side soup on tom yum but their menu only had huge bowls of it for 8-9 bucks. So I decided on the chicken red curry. My friend also had ordered a pad Thai beef, not spicy, and these chicken skewers. I felt like the chicken skewers were dry. And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me. Also, as were snacking on the appetizer, the pad Thai came out and was sitting at our table four like five minutes. Then the server came back and asked us if we touched it yet and we said no. And he took the plate without saying anything. We looked at each other in silence and thought how really weird this was. He came back and said that the pad Thai was for the other table, because they ordered chicken and we ordered beef. So a beef pad Thai came out but it was really spicy when we asked for no spice. ... So strange... Even still though, the pad Thai tasted way better than my red curry.  I also ordered a Thai hot tea, which I liked a lot. But really strange experience. I am not eager to come back."}
{"text":"Thai food has been a way to escape Chandler and send my taste buds to an exotic land far away from here. I have always been interested in finding Thai food restaurants, and since my favorite location closed I decided to try Thai Rama. I have eaten at Thai Rama more times than I can count on one hand; that's how pleased I am with the food and service.   On my last trip to Thai Rama I ordered the number fifty-two with chicken, as it comes with your choice of meat, also known as pineapple fried rice.  It cost less than ten dollars for a meal that could be split between three people. I have never heard of adding pineapple to rice, but the explosion of pineapple against the spice of the dish was exquisite and worked quite well. The restaurant stays true to their heat specifications. Mild, being no heat, Medium only having a bite, Hot with a serious kick and I guarantee you can imagine Very hot.  A group of friends and I, all together four of us, entered the restaurant around seven and it was slightly packed with only a booth and table open. We were immediately seated with our menus and were soon visited by a friendly busboy who came and took our drink orders. He was back in less than three minutes despite how crowded the restaurant was. Our waiter arrived not long after and had no trouble waiting for our indecisive eaters and answering questions to appease our curiosity. The food was served efficiently and our waiter checked on us the right amount to see if we needed anything.  We split the check four ways, each of us paying less than ten dollars. For the amount of food we received this price was phenomenal. I would definitely come back to Thai Rama over and over again."}
{"text":"Visited Thai Rama on a business lunch and was absolutely pleased.   Had the Thai (marinated) chicken wings as an appetizer and they were just out of this world infused with flavor, not to mention the home-made sweet chili sauce that I could have drank shots of, as it's so delicious.  My entree was the Pad Thai, and quite honestly, the best I've had in the PHX Metro area.  The seasoning and spices were spread evenly throughout the dish, so there were no hot or bland spots that you normally find with Pad Thai.  I thought the noodles were generously sauced, keeping them from clumping together and found the overall portion size to quite generous for a lunch entree.    Sometimes it's the little things that catch my attention and this time it was the complimentary (which is standard for Thai restaurants) cup of soup.  The soup actually had ingredients other than just broth.  It was loaded.  It was substantial.    The wait staff was very pleasant and attentive, but not overly so.  Food delivery timing was normal for a standard lunch crowd.  Apparently the word is out on how good this place is as we arrived at 11:30 and by noon there were no available seats in the ample dining area.  Booth seats were comfortable and clean.  I would highly recommend Thai Rama and absolutely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Cheap, fresh, delicious!  A friend of mine introduced me to this little Thai place and it's awesome. I'm definitely coming back. I had the mango chicken and our was so incredibly flavorful! Next time I'll get medium though...mild was too mild."}
{"text":"So delicious year-after-year casual inexpensive gracious service amazing smells hot coconut chicken med hot just the ticket w plum wine and white rice"}
{"text":"Its alright.... quite ambient and its good for business casual hang out. At least you dont have to yell across the table to get your communication going.  Food is ok. Its an americanized thai. You taste spicy and salty but hardly you taste sour and the thai spice and fragrance.  The real deal especially soup call tom yam served in thailand will stimulate your every bid of your mouth with ozzing saliva. Oh btw the way white tomyam is better than red once"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed.  Previous times we have had take out was always good.  Satay Chicken was so dry; Mi Krob wasn't crunching and missing alot of the ingredients.    Pha Thai was also like it was made earlier that day.  We have always had really great food here and I've been going there for years, especially for their Peanut Sauce.  We spend over $50 per order each time, but so disappointed.  I can only hope if I try again, it will be better.  I have tried other Thai restaurants and there is only one on east Thomas road that I really would say is one step above.  Thai Lahna on east Indian School Road."}
{"text":"Continuing on my kid free week, I decided to get some thai food one night during the week.  I had been by Thai Rama a few times and had been wanting to stop.  I was greeted upon walking in and told the woman I wanted to order to go.  She gave me a menu and offered to let me sit down at a table to decide.  She asked if she could get me a drink as well.  She prompty returned with my drink, took my order, and asked if she could get me anything else while I waited.  That's pretty darn good service for a to go order.  My food was ready in a flash and it was nicely packed and still hot when I arrived at home.  The pinapple fried rice was not the best I've had but it was good.  The yellow curry was delicious!  I will be going back here soon.  The service and the food were first rate.  And it's close to home which makes it grate in my book!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best Thai food which I've tried so far. The price is reasonable also they have enough of quantity for me even I am a man. Therefore, I sincerely recommend this restaurant to all of you."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Not expensive at all and the food quality is great :)  This is where my boyfriend and I go all the time if we are craving Thai food.  Their pad thai is just the best too.  Lovely staff and great service.  If you are craving thai, this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped by late for some to-go spicy seafood soup and rice. Turned out really good and would come back for a sit-down for sure."}
{"text":"Monkey."}
{"text":"Authentic and consistently excellent food, and a great value, too!"}
{"text":"This is our top favorite Thai restaurant in Chandler! We especially love the Evil Jungle Noodles, green curry, and Mango Delight. We always top off our meal with the sticky rice with coconut ice cream. We eat here at least once a week. The staff is super friendly and the service great!"}
{"text":"My wife and i went for lunch last week.  The food was so so and the service was a bit slow.  We both got lunch specials that came with soup, spring roll and fried wontons.  The soup was not what I would call a traditional Thai soup, the spring roll was too greasy, and the wontons were bland.  My wife got the yellow curry and I got Panang.  I ordered mine \"Thai spicy\" but it was more like medium.  Next time we go for Thai we'll try the Thai Cafe which is just a mile or so away."}
{"text":"Saturday 5:15 pm. Our first time here. Service prompt, very polite. Servers checked on us as a team, no complaints at all! Food all came out in good timing.   Egg rolls delicious, very crisp, fresh inside, not greasy. Chicken wings... tried them only b/c of the Yelp comments... They really are that good, nice & crispy, & the sauce that comes on the side is addictive! Thom Kha soup FANTASTIC, chose chicken in it, & as others mentioned, this places uses great white meat!  We both ordered Thai iced tea, sweet but not overly sugared. Then switched to hot tea which was unsweetened & surprisingly delicious in flavor, what the heck?!   Our appetizers were so shockingly fresh & good that we skipped an entree & simply ordered another round of wings & egg rolls.  WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming for years and it is by far our favorite restaurant! Sometimes the wait to get greeted takes a while because they seem to have limited staff, but they are always friendly and it is always worth it."}
{"text":"Food is okay but service was absolutely frustrating and inconvenient. I attempted to call in to make a to-go order at 12:30 PM on Monday and no one picked up the phone. That makes sense, restaurants can get busy. However, I tried calling multiple times for the next 30 minutes and no one picked up. Ever. Not once... I can understand if you are busy but do not straight up ignore a call for half an hour.   I went instead in person to order and when asked if they even had a working phone since I tried to call in, the staff said \"yeah but we've been busy so we couldn't answer. Sorry.\"  I looked around and about a quarter to half the tables were taken and as I waited for my food, they just sat around doing nothing. This was really offensive and I will frankly never go here again.   If you are really busy, I can understand not picking up the phone once but ignoring it completely, not even putting me on hold is ridiculous. To make it worse, to lie straight to my face that you're busy and couldn't pick up for half an hour is sad. If you can't learn to pick up a phone for an order, maybe you shouldn't be working in a restaurant."}
{"text":"We were going to go to our normal Thai Restaurant http://www.yelp.com/biz/tipps-88-thai-restaurant-tempe but when we arrived they had closed their doors due to the economy.  So we hit up Thai Rama and the overall thought was it was just meh.  The food was spicy but not very flavorful, service was a little slow and the prices were a little high for what we got.  We will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"This is one of my old favorites that I take my friends and family to.  I love the curry dishes here, especially Panang Curry and Evil Jungle Princess Noodles. They have brown rice, which is a plus.  The service is friendly, the owner will come out and talk to each table if she is there.  The Thai tea, both hot and iced, is well worth it.  The menu has something for everyone who likes Asian food in general, from Teriyaki Chicken, to very exotic dishes.  My friends and family always have loved what they get, the food has been consistently great over the years.  If you're in Chandler, check this place out!"}
{"text":"When you ask for HOT it means hot. Not take it home and add more hot sauce and sriracha... WTH?"}
{"text":"I am not one to write reviews, however this curry was hands down the best Thai curry I have ever had in my life. We tried both the red and green with chicken and tofu and they were flawless. The best cooking job with tofu around as well. We have been searching Arizona for a good Thai place, and we will gladly make the drive to get some more. Great service and staff too. I will be thinking about this food until i can get it again. Anyone who thinks the servers are rude, the food is too salty, or the owners just get their friends to write reviews is absurdly crazy. This place is legit delicious, and I'm glad we randomly happened to stop in."}
{"text":"I called and called and no one answered. Tried three times.  Is this pace even open?  Pretty sad.  Had to go elsewhere and they got our order wrong.  Open to new restaurant ideas for Thai soup. The best for me when I am sick!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and the price is excellent.  Nothing amazing, but solid Thai food, consistent and yummy and clean atmosphere. I was hoping for a tad more authentic, but this is my go to place for soup when I am sick! :-)"}
{"text":"The curry fried rice w/ cashews!! OMG! Love this place!! Red curry chicken was great! We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for years. From the outside, it looks like a fast food place with a drive through. I was pleasantly surprised that they serve up some delicious Thai food. I had the Panang Curry and it was delicious. Portions are ample and I will be eating the leftovers for  a couple lunches.. I'm pretty happy about that!"}
{"text":"I went with the PAD PRIAW WAN LUNCH SPECIAL and asked for extra spicy.  Wow that was a creeper!  The waiter said he made it a 2 out of 5 in terms of heat.  I was sweating bullets, it felt great.  I'll definitely be back to see what 5 feels like.   Overall great service, reasonable prices, good quality food."}
{"text":"we eat here a lot... And have never had a bad meal. The food is excellent. The evil jungle noodles are FANTASTIC. I would recommend for takeout too!"}
{"text":"Place is cozy... Food was delish!!! But what I liked the most was the dessert fried banana with coconut ice cream! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Quiet ambience on a crowded corner. The Tom Yum Gai took me back to my summer in Thailand. My friend says she has yet to be let down by the vegetarian options. Service is prompt and polite."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I've been here quite a few times and absolutely Love their Pad Thai, the best in Tempe after Tipps closed down.  However, the past two times I have been here I've gotten really bad service.  Last night I ordered the usual shrimp and chicken pad thai with the vegetable egg rolls and sweet n sour sauce as an appetizer.  We waited, and waited, for the eggrolls to come and about 15 minutes in we finally saw our waitress again..bringing out the eggrolls with our main meals...which was disappointing because we were starving and would have really enjoyed an appetizer.   First I noticed there was no sauce with the eggrolls and then, I realized that my Pad Thai came without shrimp, I waited for over five minutes for my waitress to come back but she was nowhere in sight so I told the hostess and she said she'd fix it, another five minutes passed and when she returned there were only two shrimp with it, i mean, seriously? You forget to give me shrimp and then 'remedy' the situation by only giving me two? Not enough.  Our actual waitress did not come by AT ALL for the remainder of our meal, not even to refill our waters once.  Also, the previous time I ate at Thai Rama the service was similarly bad.  While the food is indeed awesome, I don't think I'll stop by again due to the service"}
{"text":"Tried at lunch today. They had the best Thai food I've eaten in Phoenix. Big portion for lunch with enough for leftovers. Only downside was the time it took for them to cook & bring to the table, so I wouldn't go if you're on a tight lunch schedule."}
{"text":"They must really be doing well cause they pick up the phone for pickup orders about 30% of the time.   I can't tell you how many times I've had to change my lunch location.  Note: Food is great though."}
{"text":"Really good food. The reason for my 2 stars is because it's way busy for only 3 people long wait for appetizer and entree and to be seated  They didn't offer refills and kept walking by us like if we weren't there. Finally we got up and asked for the menu for dessert and boxes to go. Asked what came in the crab fried rice and the guy with a smartass answer was like \"crab\". I don't know if I'll come back here customer service sucks. I'll stick to Thai basil next time. If they had more people helping out they wouldn't be so busy bussing tables and forgetting about their customers. So rude."}
{"text":"I haven't been back here in a long time and the restaurant certainly aged so much. It's old and run down. The atmosphere was not pleasant. We weren't even acknowledged when we entered. We were just standing there waiting for a few minutes before the server came to sit us down and it's not even busy. The food was not what it used to be, dry and not flavorful. We have had better Thai food and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Spent a lot of money at this restaurant. Food was good and slowly degraded.   Spent like $50, 3 times a week and referred people. Wish I did not do that.   After receiving uncooked chicken skewers for my girlfriend, they were re-ordered and returned the same uncooked way.   the waitress was rude and I will not be returning.  Plus, they are understaffed and if you need something you won't get it. You'll just wait and look around, waving at them and they will ignore you.  better Thai place on 7th avenue, south of indian school on the east side of the road!!"}
{"text":"So I am seriously bummed out to be writing this review because I loved this place and WAS a regular for several years.  There were even a few weeks my sister and I would eat here a few  times.  Last night we took a friend who had never been there and we were RAVING about how good it is and how much we love it there.  As we are all eating our dinner my sister and our friend say...\"what is that?\" they turned around and a dinosaur sized cockroach is climbing on the back of their booth!  we were all horrified and jumped out of the booth!  The owner was sitting near the back and asked us what the problem was.  When we said it is a HUGE ROACH!!!  One of her servers ran over and scooped it up but her only response was it is summer time and they like to come in!  ARE YOU SERIOUS??  The sarcastic me wanted to say yeah so do homless people but that isn't ok is it???  We were not even offered an apology, different booth or any sort of discount or comped meal.  To say I am disgusted is an understatement.  I'm sorry Thai Rama I loved you but we are breaking up and no it isn't me It's definitely YOU!  All I wonder now is what is happening in your kitchen where my food is prepared :("}
{"text":"Exotic aromas teased my palate upon entry.  The dining area was bustling, but the one waitress (who also served as hostess, cashier and table busser) operated most efficiently.  The lunch special prices are agreeable, even to the most penny-pinching niggard in your party, at under $7, and come with soup, an egg roll and a couple of fried won-tons.  Their phad thai portion was about twice the size of their curry specials.  This place gets busy around 12:30, so be sure to arrive before 12:15, or stroll in after 12:45.  I watched heartbroken as a strikingly tall blond, sporting intriguing body art, turned and walked out the door once she realized there were no open tables.  My outward demeanor was sullen, while inside I was screaming: \"You maniacs!  You blew it!  Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!\", as I pounded the table with my fists.  Great food, but can get a little loud.  I highly recommend Thai Rama, even if you have to endure the grating vocal stylings of an insecure nit-wit who feels compelled to laugh at every insignificant comment uttered from those dirty apes she strolled in with."}
{"text":"Amazing Lunch Special Pricing. Great Service, awesome food. Can't ask for anything better, except to make sure the soup is nice and hot. I got a lil bit of a cold one recently. But otherwise, I will return over and over again."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Thai Rama, but stopped after we witnessed management refusing service to a woman in a Hijab. That's not the sort of vibe we like with our dinner."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my team to send of a co-worker who is leaving. The lunch specials were a little different than what I am used to. I hadn't heard of a few dishes that were listed. There were about 15 of us and it didn't take that long for our orders. I ordered the pork with pineapple, others tried the pad see ew, curries and and pad thai. I could tell that the pineapple was not fresh but it wasn't bad for less than 8 bucks. The iced tea was very tasty and refreshing and I will for sure try the Thai iced tea next time. There wasn't an empty table in the whole place. All lunch specials come with soup and an eggroll, both yummy and seasoned well.  Take it for what is, a quick and easy Thai place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Service is a little slow but they are super friendly. Thai hot is actually hot! Better then the thai restaurants down town for sure"}
{"text":"One of the worst Thai food places in chandler. This place is no where near authentic. I ordered a simple red curry that was supposed to be Thai hot, ended up with watered down whole milk. My significant other ordered pad Thai which was very sweet. Their prik nam pla was way past expiration dateI will give them this, their lunch special soup did have good flavor but I would never return just for this. If you are a Thai food connoisseur this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"While it won't win any design awards, I did have a fantastic view to the west of a majestic Arizona sunset. I actually ordered to go and was able to sit while waiting and soak in the energy of Thai Rama. A slow Monday night had two straighty couples (yes, you heteros, you know who you are) holding hands and nibbling slowly. The walls were adorned with pictures of Thai royalty. I think anyway. It could just be a promo poster from a vendor. I don't know. And Bud Light signs. Ahhh...America! The Thai beer I enjoyed while waiting certainly helped pass the time. Service here is extrordaniarly friendly, like most Thai places I've encountered. I purposely over ordered as I wanted left overs. Pad Thai. Outstanding. After that I recommend numbers 1, 7, 23 and 27. Paint by number. Order by number. It's simple. And everyone's gonna love it. Thai Thai for now yelpers! P.S. The #18 soup is so amazing...lemon grass and coconut milk. Dee lish!"}
{"text":"The parking is just enough to fill the seating inside.Customer service was sub par. This restaurant should change their sign from please wait to be seated to seat yourself as our party would have been over waiting 10 + minutes to be seated or order taken at their rate as they are understaffed so be prepared for the wait. As we went to seat ourselves and see if there was anyone working the front we observed one of the personnel eating her lunch with her back faced toward the front. We sat ourselves order taken 15 mins upon arrival. Food came out approximately 40 minutes after we sat down. Food was alright, customer service was sub par. Ordered the green curry and the yellow curry along with couple appetizers. Would not be a good idea to bring children with you if they are hungry and can't do the wait. Place is over rated for what it is."}
{"text":"Thai Rama is a bit hit or miss.  But since I live nearby it is convenient and it's more hit than miss.  Last night's Pad Thai was a hit!  I love that the portion is huge so I have dinner and a whole meal's worth of leftovers.  I ordered mild and got just that - the sweet peanuty taste of the rice sticky noodles.  Good chunks of chicken and several big shrimp.  Tons of crunchy bean sprouts and cabbage.  I'm hoping for the same thing next time :-)"}
{"text":"Good decision to have lunch here. Their lunch special is under $6 for a heaping scoop of rice, crispy wontons, soup and a nice helping of stir fried meat and vegetables. I thought the place would be tiny from the outside but it's actually nice and spacious. I ordered the Mango Delight stir fry level 1 thai hot. More like delightmyass on fire!! That stuff was hot!I also ordered the thai tea and my boyfriend got a draft beer, which were both reasonably priced.  Anyway, the staff was really nice and the service was good. I would come back but not too regularly."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The tom kha soup was some of the best I've had.  Service was a little slow, but they were very busy and seemed to be short staffed."}
{"text":"We went here the other day for dinner, as it's close to where my boyfriend gets his hair cut and we were really craving Thai food.  I've been here once before, and remembered the food as being very good.  When we got to the restaurant, it was pretty busy and there were only two server working.  We were seated promptly and the server took our drink order.  We ordered Yahm Nuea Nahm Tohk for an appetizer (meh, it was alright - but I don't think I would have really LOVED it anywhere to be honest).  I also ordered my standard when going out for Thai food, Paht See-iiw.  Yuuuuuuum!!!  It was great, just what I was hankering for.  I was not disappointed.  My boyfriend ordered the Evil Jungle Princess curry, and also said it was quite good.  If you are looking for a good Thai place in the Chandler area, head on over.  However, I must give a word of caution:  because it gets very busy and they are short staffed, you DO have to wait a bit for the food and refills.  This isn't a sign of bad service though, it's just that they need to have more people working certain shifts :)!!!"}
{"text":"First timer, I am from L. A  been to Thailand a couple times. This place caught me by surprise great feeling when you walk in then the food is I called  \"I am coming back\" another thing hit you at when you review your check they add 3 % for credit card hmh ... Aren't you supposed to disclose that upfront? 1 star off for that! The family who run the business are awesome in anyway."}
{"text":"Had the mango chicken lunch special. Pretty good. Chicken was dry and the sauce wasn't very hot, even though I ordered it hot. Pretty authentic though. Very nice decor. Heard that they had a taxi drive through the dining room??? They used the insurance money well!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! The restaraunt is clean and pleasantly decorated, smells wonderful. The food was steaming hot and tasted very fresh. We have found our Thai food in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"i've been to thai rama off of camelback a handful of times, but i just recently found out about this locaiton. i live on the border of gilbert and chandler and i was thrilled that they had this locaiton.   oh my goodness...this is just absolute yumminess!!! i've been inside to eat once while a friend was visiting from out of town. it is such good food!! i ordered the yellow curry and she ordered paht se ew. both were excellent dishes!! the service was pleasant and we had a great dining experience.  since then my husband and i have ordered to go and we haven't had anything but wonderful dishes from here. it has quickly become one of my favorite new places to eat!!"}
{"text":"Being Laos, Thai food is my comfort food so I frequently crave it. I always order the Green Chicken Curry and it was very good! I def recommend it. The chicken tastes fresh and tender. Also ordered the spicy chicken fried rice and it was also very good! Customer service was quick and friendly. They knew I was either Thai or Laos :) & you can't go to a Thai spot without getting Thai Tea!"}
{"text":"I was couch surfing down the road and had to try some local Thai, having worked at a Thai place in my home city, so I walked down here one Tuesday evening for carry out.   Instead of calling ahead, I walked on over to see the inside, stated carryout and asked for a menu. The outside looks pretty bland, but the inside is a dim-lit, mood-setting environment that I enjoyed very much with a full bar. I sat at the bar and ordered a pad Thai with shrimp and chicken at max spiciness (best way to judge a new Thai place is by its all-popular pad Thai!). I ordered a beer while I waited and sat quietly. The place was pretty empty, but that's expected on a Tuesday night, even at dinner time. Food took about 15 minutes and I was on my way.   Unfortunately, the food was almost as bland as the building. The pad thai noodles are also the thicker, more-Japanese style noodle than the thinner pad thai, which added more to the lack of flavor. I ended up having to add sriracha to cover the significant lack of spice and flavor. The shrimp was very minimal (2-3 pieces). But one plus is that there was a ton* of food and the quantity almost made up for the poor quality. This is the only reason there are 3, instead of 2, stars.   I don't know if Indianapolis is blessed with amazing Thai food, or if this place really is that bad. Either way, I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Not the most amazing Thai ever. I do highly recommend the coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, good lunch prices.  I liked the fact that when I told my waitress I would like to opt out of the deep fried foods that came with the lunch special, she immediately offered a larger portion of my main dish.  Nice touch.  Lunch special got me a nice cup of soup, a decent, but large, plate of fried rice, and a cup of hot tea for $6.54-ish.  A good price for a good meal.  Their fried rice wasn't the best I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.  I would go back and try another dish."}
{"text":"I'm a crazy regulars (go 3 times a week)  the food and service rocks!  I've tried several plates and can say I love many, except I'm not much of a duck person.  Wrote this a year ago, still love this place = the best Thai in town.  #29 is now my new favorite.    #26 medium, chicken with basil extra sauce - brilliant (order #25 if you don't like basil. # yellow curry is the second best to Thai ESan's & Swaddee  - ordered it for 6 months  Mango Chicken very very good, not too sweet #24 is very good mix with green beans and beef, but the green beans could be softer. #72 veg fried rice, mild/medium add chicken is a safe choice and is really fresh and so good I ordered it for 3 months straight.   THE BEST ANGEL WINGS   The staff knows us by name and never give us a menu - love them - Ponny keeps us happy."}
{"text":"I had a very good meal here, again with friends from work. I'm new to Thai, so I don't remember the names of everything we ordered, but there was this almost Rice Krispy noodle dish with bits of deep-fried chicken and shrimp in it. It was sweet, crispy, and delicious. We had Pad Thai, which I've liked at other places, but here the noodles weren't firm enough for my liking. We had some deep friend shrimp which are hard to mess up, and Thai Rama didn't. Oh, and there's a deep fried vegetable dish...the yams or sweet potatoes are delicious! The spice and flavor on most of the food was good. They have this amazing iced coffee drink with heavy cream on the top, and it is absolutely fabulous! I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Very flavorful and good quality at a reasonable price. Would recommend giving this place a try ;-)"}
{"text":"Great food, the curry evil jungle noodles and the mango delight were fabulous! However,when you charge for another bowl of rice for two people I have a problem. I would have given it four stars if it wasn't for a mere 1.75 plus tax.  I think it's more out of principle than substance."}
{"text":"pineapple curry...yes please! What a great option for curry. A nice balance of the curry spice and complimentary to the coconut milk. My dish contained shrimp which was a great addition to an already wonderful dish. I will be back really soon."}
{"text":"How have I not been here before?!?! I pass this place all. the. time. and have never gone in. I guess because it looks a little run down from the outside. Well, this place is shockingly cute on the inside! I met a friend here in the middle of the week for dinner and the place was hopping. We were seated right away and had no issue with service. I had to try the Thai tea after reading all the glowing reviews.... it was quite good. Maybe not super stand out from others that I've had, but good and it came in a large glass, which was nice. For food, I ordered the yellow curry and my friend had the pad see iw. I got my curry 'hot' because usually restaurants tame back the spice and it's never enough. This place did not. The curry was blazing, but delicious and full of flavor at the same time. I was happy I had the Thai tea to coat my mouth. The curry was thick, packed with potatoes, carrots, and chicken and came with a mound of rice. I ended up being able to eat it for 4 meals (big portion), and it got better each time I ate it. I definitely want to go back and try more of their food!   PS 1300!!!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. Period.  The three star review is the fact when I call to place a pick up order 7/10 times it takes 20+ back to back calls to get them to pick up the stupid phone so I can place my order. I have complained about this a couple of times and it doesn't get any better. On the rare days where they actually pick up the phone to take my order the service is prompt, polite, and delicious every time.  Really sick and tired of the staff not picking up the phone."}
{"text":"While visiting, I checked out Yelp for Thai food in the area. Originally, I wanted to go to a different location, but it was closed on a Sunday. We came for an early dinner at 5pm on Sunday. No one was there probably due to Super Bowl. Shortly after we sat, five other families came in. I ordered their house salad and added tofu with their peanut sauce dressing to share with a friend. Yum! I loved their large chunks of fried tofu and their peanut sauce was super tasty.  For dinner, I ordered their #41, my favorite Pad Thai with shrimp but it came out with beef. I was little disappointed it had beef, but I was hungry. I wasn't impressed with the sauce they used it wasn't all that tasty but I was hungry and ate half portion. My friend order a beef pho, she thought it was okay. She thought the broth tasted a little funny so she asked the waiter for some limes. It seemed to help. She wasn't able to finished it all and good it to go. The service was great and friendly. D√©cor was good, a little old fashion. The game was on but no one was interested in it. Prices were good."}
{"text":"Wanted Thai food near Chandler tonight but realized few are open on Sundays. Here's how the morning's research played out:  1. Great reviews for Thai Rama on Yelp but no hours of operation. Strike one. 2. Look for hours on restaurant's web site. Strike two.  3. Call restaurant. No voicemail greeting after 34 rings. Strike three looking. 4. Discover Facebook page, which despite having just 85 fans does include hours of operation, as well as some nice feedback from patrons. 5. Will try Thai Rama tonight with unfairly high expectations. Hope the food is worth all the effort it took to get the most basic information."}
{"text":"Thai Rama is above average.  Don't go for the appetizer with the crispy noodles thing, but everything else was reasonably authentic and flavorful.  Pad Thai was everything I'd ever want from the dish.  Tom Yum Gai was aromatic and enjoyable.  It is not the best Thai around, but I'd recommend it if you are really close by."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Not the best I've ever had but the convenience of the drive through for picking up to-go orders is nice. The portion sizes are very large."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite Thai spot in town!  Service is always great, and the food is always delicious!  I always want to try new dishes, but my staple there is the Chicken Pad Grapero.  I always order it Thai hot and enjoy the sweat I get from the spices."}
{"text":"This place really surpassed our expectations. We were greeted really fast and very friendly as soon as we walked in, and we got our choice to sit anywhere that was available. Went with work college and had a great lunch for under $10 per person."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees! Everything on the menu is good and has great service. It has a quiet, romantic atmosphere. Try the dumplings they're to die for!"}
{"text":"One thing I love about a Thai restaurant is the kitsch.  The decor here was really bland and I felt like I was eating in a hotel restaurant, rather than something as ethnically spicy as a Thai place. I had just finished at the rock gym just down the road and I was famished.  I hadn't been to this location yet and liked the one on Camelback, so I figured I'd give it a try. The specials board should have just been erased.  I ordered the crab puffs, which were on the board, but was told about 5 minutes after I was seated that they were out.  What the heck?  Why keep it up there then? It was 1pm on a Saturday and the place was almost completely empty.  Not a good sign.   Our drinks were refilled often, but it took about 15 minutes to get our food.  15 minutes in an empty place on a Saturday afternoon?  It just felt like a long wait.  Luckily, the satay appetizer came out quickly.  The peanut sauce wasn't as good as most and didn't have as much peanut flavor as it did sweet. On the plus side, I ordered my catfish dish Thai hot...and it was.  It's not 11pm and I'm definitely feeling the burn!  Strong flavors, so I really don't mind.  My dad used to say \"If you can't feel it the next day, why eat it?\"  I guess I'm daddy's girl"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good Thai food. My favorite dish is the crab fried rice, followed by the eggplant stir fry. I highly recommend both of these dishes, which are well worth the trip. I find the curries to be a bit watery and the service is usually mediocre. Still, it's good Thai food within walking distance."}
{"text":"A fine dining experience or a drive-through window for fast, delicious Thai food!  Everything I've tried on the menu is delightful!  My personal favorite is the Evil Jungle Princess noodles.  The chef allows you to select \"mild, medium or spicy\" for your entre.  The appetizers, particularly the fried tofu, are delicious and perfect for that short wait before your main dish is served.  Most menu items are under $10.  There is virtually no wait ever for seating.  They have several wines and beers to choose from, in addition to their enormous menu.  This is *five star* dining at *two star* pricing!"}
{"text":"This place is a little bit slow and nothing fancy, but the food is delish! The crab wontons are the best I've ever had and the Yellow Curry with chicken made my night. Yum!"}
{"text":"My friends and I all got the drunken noodle. It was mediocre, we asked for five star but it came way too spicy, AND WE ALL GOT TERRIBLY SICK. Stomach cramps, nausea, the works. Will not be eating here again!!!"}
{"text":"For years this was our go to lunch spot! Love Thai Rama, it has had many staff but the food has always remained consistent."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night and the family and I were headed out for dinner. Our regular restaurant had too long of a wait, so we found this place and thought we would try it out.  After we were seated, the hostess brought our drinks and took our order. There weren't many customers so I thought it wouldn't take too long for our food, I was wrong, it was about 45 minutes until we had our food. The food was very bland. The hostess that was supposedly waiting on us, rarely came by to fill drinks, or remove plates. When it was time for the bill a young man came by and introduced himself as \"Jeremy\", this was the first time we had seen this guy. when we paid the bill we noticed that they added auto 20% gratuity, which came to an $11 tip to a guy that never came to our table. I never have a problem leaving a decent tip, when they have earned it. In my experience when auto gratuity is added to a customers bill you can count on not seeing your waiter or waitress until its time for the bill. It's pathetic when businesses put the burden of paying their employees on the back of the customer."}
{"text":"This restaurant has delicious Thai cuisine! The pricing is reasonable and food is savory. The interior of the restaurant is a little outdated and needs improvement. Hospitality was decent, but the food service is particularly slow.   Overall a great place to grab a casual bite to eat. Mango sticky rice is to die for!! I make sure to eat here everytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"Thai Rama is one of my most favorite places ever.  The place alone brings forth memories of the first time I ever even tasted Thai cuisine.  It was love at first bite.  Thai Rama is an intimate restaurant with soft lighting and relaxing music.  The wait staff is always polite and nice.  The food is amazing, always.  I've had everything from appetizers to desserts and everything is always hearty and filling."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is always awesome and prepared right! Best part is the drive thru! I love being able to call in and grab stuff on the go!"}
{"text":"Don't know if it is located in a bad area of if Phoenix is depressing and crappy in general - I'm not from there so wouldn't know. The food is great here!  What a find!  I luckily stumbled accross it on a trip cross country.  At first I thought it would be bad because there was a fat lady eating alone there.  Usually fat people eat at cheap places that serve huge quantities but that was not the case here.   I learned a lesson from this fat woman....it changed my opinion of fat people and made me less prejudiced towards them. Way to go Thai Rama and way to go fat lady!  Kudos to both of you."}
{"text":"Best Thai In The Valley!!  A friend of mine had been raving to me about this place for years. I finally visited it in April, and then again yesterday.   My April visit was a really nice experience. The servers was helpful with suggestions and explanations of the food. I couldn't recall my friends recommendations, but tried #26, Chicken (choice of meats) stir-fried with fresh chili peppers, onions and bamboo shoots, which I had mildly spicy. It was delicious, and I left with every intention of returning soon, however a car crashing into their building caused them to close down for several months. Bummer.  Well, I finally got back there armed with my friend's recommendations. My server was very familiar with my friend, and recited off to me as his favorites, the same recommendations he had given me. I took that as a good sign, and it was. This time I had #36 Eggplant stir-fried with chili, onions, carrots and mushrooms with chicken (choice of meats). We settled on medium heat this time, which is how the server told me that my friend orders it.  It was spectacular! I had never had Asian eggplant before! I have no idea exactly how they cooked the eggplant, but it was juicy and full of the flavor of the sauce. I found myself favoring it over all of the ingredients in the dish.   The sauce was savory with all sorts of notes that I couldn't identify, but loved. I believe it had a healthy dose of Thai basil, a nice bite, a wonderful rich body, and a wonderful dose of garlic. All of the ingredients combined so nicely, I nearly hurt myself trying to finish the entire dish. In the end, I had a healthy amount to take home for later.   Based on the heat of the dish, I decided that a scoop of coconut ice cream was in order. It too was delicious.   My server came back to my table often to chat and to check on my progress. It was one of the most delightful meals that I can recall. In addition to my left-overs, I took home an order of #15 Tohm Yahm Goong - a zesty hot and sour shrimp soup with lemon grass and fresh mushrooms.  I have eaten Thai at several locations in the valley, and this was by far the best. I already know what I am having on my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent noodle soup and the red curry with green beans was enjoyable . great VALUE for your $"}
{"text":"Before I discovered my love for Thai food, every time I drove by this place I'd comment on how \"sketchy\" it looked and how I'd never go there...Oh how times have changed! I would eat here everyday if I could! I've only tried a couple of items because of diet restrictions and just knowing what I like. The pineapple shrimp curry (with added veggies) is my go-to, normally with a side of egg rolls or dumplings. Their curry is so delicious that I constantly crave it, my only gripe would be what I think is a bay leaf or lemongrass (I have no idea) that throws off the taste a smidgen but not enough for me to try and order it without the mystery leaf. Their crab fried rice was good, but a little too oily/fried for my taste but it's fried rice so that's just a personal preference. It would probably make a great hangover meal. All in all I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great comforting thai food!  What I l really liked: Friendly staff and great tasting food that made me feel warm and revived.  What they can improve: Might just have been me, but the booth I sat in was a little low for the table height so it was slightly uncomfortable.  The staff was very friendly and great with checking up on you and answering any questions about the menu. They were very excited about the customers being there and about helping you select a menu item that you will enjoy. I really did enjoy my dinner and look forward to visiting Thai Rama again!  I got the Vegetable Panang Curry which comes with rice on the side. I smelled it as it was being brought to my table and instantly started drooling! They have a wide array of menu items and they all sounded great. They do serve alcoholic drinks too if you are looking for an adult beverage with your meal. I did enjoy my meal and I think their prices are fair for the amount and quality of the food. It was $10.50 for the Vegetable Panang Curry and I took some of it home for another meal.  Thai Rama is located at the Northwest corner of Dobson Rd and Chandler Blvd by Safelite AutoGlass in Chandler, AZ. You can call ahead, place an order for takeout, and use their drive-thru for picking up an order that was called in for pickup. Their location is great if you are looking to visit the Chandler mall, Downtown Chandler, live or work in the area, or just want great thai comfort food. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"As I recently turned vegetarian, I awoke this morning with a sadness in my heart. It had happened. I had a Thai food craving. This could only end in sadness, I thought to myself.   We live uptown and went to Yelp to look at local Thai options.   I ordered the Vegetarian Green Curry and a Thai Iced Coffee, and my boyfriend ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry with a Thai Iced Tea. I awaited our food apprehensively, hoping to not be disappointed with the outcome.  Boy was I in for a surprise! The Green Curry looked simple enough, with a huge pile of assorted veggies amidst a beautiful sea of green curry/coconut milk. I took my first bite and the flavor overwhelmed me. It was absolutely delicious! Savory, authentic, and absolutely amazing. This is a must stop for pretty much any ethnic-food-loving vegetarian out there! My conscience was at ease while my palate was swooning.  The decor is kind of traditional Thai, and I'm half-Asian so it reminded me of all the little mom-n-pop Thai diners growing up in California. There's even an adorable plush area hidden around in the back for groups - with comfy lavish pillows and a huge lazy susan in the middle of the table. Thanks Thai Rama - you've made me a happy ethnic vegetarian. xoxo"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai Food Joints out...i have never had a incorrect order, i have never had a bad meal.   I took my brother and we ate the spiciest dish later he had an upset tummy but hes a wimp and cant handle spicy"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. I think the panang curry is the best I've had in the Tempe area.  The people who complain about the food here apparently don't have taste buds and don't know what good flavor is. Try this place out and don't just get the same lame ass thing that everyone gets, pad Thai. Try other thing it might surprise you!"}
{"text":"The thai food here is pretty good. I have always ordered take out so I cannot comment on the service, however, i have never had to wait and the people there are very nice. The red curry is yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good when we don't want to drive to Ray and Rural to go eat and Swaddees (this place is the best). this place gets pretty packed during dinner on the weekends and service can be slow sometimes but the food is pretty good. tohm kha soup is good, panang curry, pad thai, and the hot and spicy noodles are pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered our food and waited 15 minutes. The waiter came and told us that \"the kitchen is busy and is making our food and did not forget about us\". During this time, the waiter continued to bring food to other tables and one table actually received their food and finished eating before we got ours. We waited anther 15 minutes before leaving. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BY GOING HERE."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better Thai food. This place was missing a key part of thai food- I just can't put my finger on it. I thought that the meal overall was spicy even when we requested mild and it was salty. Like, I've never had salty thai. It was weriod. The staff was friendly and the price was great, just wished the food was a little better. Maybe Arizonia has a different spin on thai, but it was defintiely not up my alley and my entire party hated their food."}
{"text":"The red curry is my favorite thing right now. This place has top two for me in Phoenix. First Golden Thia Palace on 75th ave. The noodles are amazing aswell. Great to go orders and they deliver. Red Curry you rock !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered potstickers, larb and split a yellow curry.  Potstickers very good.  Larb (although the menu spells it Lahb...so I'll bite on how it's actually spelled), very good.  Yellow curry we ordered mild.  It was very good but I'm not sure how mild it was.  I'm not a big spicy food eater, so while this wasn't unbearable, but it was spicier that what I'd call mild."}
{"text":"Yuk!  I tried this place based on seeing favorable reviews on Yelp, but this is not good thai food.  I'm not sure why people think this is good.  The food is not very fresh and does not taste like it should.  I guess if you have never tried good thai food, this might be good to you.  Don't waste your time and money if you are looking for a quality thai meal."}
{"text":"My friend and I went hiking for the first time at Camelback mountain. We both didn't have anything for breakfast besides a banana (bad idea!!). During the hike we were dying and all we could think about was food. More than halfway through the hike, we decided to give up and grab lunch. We took a while to decide and ended up going here since it was nearby.   The building of this place is so cute. The decorations of the place made me feel homey. But... Let me tell you how it smell like when I walked in... IT SMELLED AMAZING!!! Whatever type of Jasmine rice this restaurant used, it smelled liked heaven.   In every Thai restaurant I go to, I must must have Thai milk tea. It just won't be right if you don't, ya know? I got a yellow curry from here (I always get curries). I got it at spicy and let me tell you, it was spicy but so good! So good! The portion was a good amount that I had leftovers to bring home. I was so full that I did not have any room for dessert :("}
{"text":"The highs? $66 pre -tip for dinner for four adults and one child, including beverages and three appetizers.  The waitress was phenomenally sweet.  She was just a ray of sunshine... and I am not being sarcastic.  Really, I hope this place recognizes how good their servers are!  The lows?  Is my tolerance for heat so unbelievable when I go to Thai restaurants?  I asked for my dish Thai Hot, just like my mom and DH.  Still, I would rate the heat level at \"black pepper.\"  I added a teaspoon full of red chili paste just to get some more heat into my dish.  I felt their white rice could have been rinsed more.  It was kind of starchy - and not in the usual way.  Then again, I rinse my rice until the water runs completely clear and it is SUCH a waste of water.  :)  I was also not a fan of their sticky rice.    I felt confident coming here, despite the recent B rating on their most recent health inspection.  I generally won't go to businesses that are rated below an A, but my parents and DH have come here quite a few times with no issue.    Would I come here again?  Maybe.  It is not OFF the list, but it isn't anywhere near the top."}
{"text":"This place(not the one in Tempe or Chandler) is my favorite place to eat out of any option. I seriously don't think they know how damned great their food it. If they were to move to a new building and modernize the decor they could charge me twice the amount and I wouldn't even flinch. We go pretty much every Friday and hover around 5pm for them to open like stalkers outside some window. Over the 4 years I have been going to this place I have been able to try various dishes and here is my rating on each dish and overall dining experience.  Ambiance: 3/5 The place doesn't have the right flow if you were to visit you would see what I mean. The takeout area is in the middle and the wait to be seated area is around 6 feet from the door and I imagine some people might not be seated due to them not being noticed. The decor isn't much of a date place if you were trying to have the whole package of aesthetics and good food so don't come in thinking it's a Ticoz or Tuck Shop.  Service: 5/5 The best I have ever had, each person is lightning quick they are super friendly and the food comes out so fast it will make your head spin sometimes.  Food:  I don't know how to articulate how great it is.  72- 5/5 Vegetable fried rice with chicken medium spice 5/5 - This is the freshest most flavorful fried rice I have tasted. All the veggies are crisp and tasty. Just add a dash of soy sauce and it is perfection. This is the first thing I tried years ago and ordered repeatedly as well as my whole lunch party for years straight.  25 - 5/5 Chicken, onions, and peppers in medium spice sauce that must be made by the gods themselves it is so flavorful. My current favorite that I order it with extra chicken and extra sauce and it is the best thing I have ever had and is spot on each and every time.  11- 5/5 Thai Angel wings -I have had a few but by far the batter on these stands head and shoulders over any other. I always order these, drown them in the sauce it comes with and it's heavenly.  Beef Panang medium spice 4/5 I am not a curry fan or any thing with similar flavors,except here, they just know how to make brilliant dishes.  Yellow Curry medium spice 4/5 the default choice for most people into thai it seems but this is the first place I tasted it that I genuinely would crave it as I am not a fan of curry.  22-  4/5 chicken with oyster sauce and veggies with hot spice. This one was super one time then ok another time but still a solid dish. Usually a mild flavor so adding hot kicks it up. 29- 4/5 similar to above with cashews with hot spice. Really great also 40 - 4/5 with chicken instead of shrimp with hot spice    Pretty much every dish I have tried from Mango delight to their soups are great. I will mention the food in my own opinion that isn't their strong dishes so they don't ruin your first initial impression if you decide to order them. 3/5 bbq chicken 2/5 fried combination some veggies are good some aren't 2/5 thai toast 2/5 eggplant 2/5 pad thai personal preference though as I dont care peanut sauce 2/5 anything with duck  This review is specific to the Camelback location as the Tempe location started out great but lost a cook and multiple employees most likely due to a ego maniacal manager. That local does have an excellent building and decor and for a time identical food just in smaller portions but having two waitress/waiters for lunch rush lead to bad service and the cook change threw off the taste. I will state I haven't been back for over a year since finally writing it off after consecutive let downs so they may have remedied the issue. The Chandler one is in the family but they don't follow the recipes and do what they want with the dishes and is more of a take out place."}
{"text":"I've lived in Thailand and enjoy Thai food so I wad excited to try Thai Rama since I've seen it a million times passing by.  Got the infamous trio I always get at a Thai restaurant: Tom yam goong, pad Thai, and green curry. All three were fails in my book. Since the flaming vessel they serve it in usually just keeps it warm rather than finish cooking it, we had a lukewarm soup with uncooked mushrooms and green onions. It was flavorful, but being lukewarm, fresh onions kept masking the flavor. Next, came the pad Thai. Too sweet and the noodles lacked definition. It was a big glob and they were really cheap with their proteins. Finally, the green curry came and it was very salty.   Will not return."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal Thai Rama patron since I moved to the Phoenix area in 2008. Their soup, Tom Yum Gai (#17 on the menu) is the best I've ever had in the valley. Other Thai restaurants I've tried in the area don't even come close! I always get mine medium spicy. As another patron suggested, the level of heat can be somewhat inconsistent depending on who is preparing the food that night. If you are concerned by this, you can always order your food mild and ask for the spices to add yourself until you've reached your desired level of heat. The staff is always very friendly. We've been coming since 2008 so they know who we are and exactly what we want, including the level of heat!"}
{"text":"i have never been to Thai Rama. i have always wanted to try it. but it wasn't really close or convenient to go to. i happened to be in the area so figured would check it out. food was less then spectacular. after 20 years...i am not really sure if it's just down graded from quality or bad suppliers. i don't know. the spring rolls. totally from a box, flash frozen. the insides were mushy and the flavors not distinct. also got the won tons. saving grace here. they were good. the pork nugget inside of it could stand to be a bit bigger. it is dwarfed by the won ton wrapper. still was really good.   i have chosen to make Pad Thai as my barometer for Thai restaurants I'm going to review on Yelp. if they cannot make this \"signature\" dish then the rest of the menu might as well be rat poison. the pad Thai was flavorful, the noodles were a tasty pile of mush. it had really long mung beans which i like. so it wasn't all bad. in fact it wasn't bad tasting. but honestly for 9+ bucks. i could have picked this up at Safeway from a box called \"Taste of Thai\" for 2.50 and cooked it myself.   atmosphere is ok. kinda old, cute menus with home made paper. with the menu items printed on a transparency. hmm. now that i think about it..it's kinda cheese. but whatever.   service was good. quick turn around. and my glass was only empty twice....but to think about it..they only filled it twice...so it was empty.....so that means...i was thirsty..and my drink was empty. hmmm ok thats kinda nit picky. it was fine. 3-4 stars if the food was umm fresher. or at least not supplied by sysco.   in conclusion. this place might have been around for 20 years. but when there are not better options. [Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, even Thai Hut...] and your the only Thai restaurant in a 20 mile radius...you can last. but i shouldn't need to point out...that you have some serious competition in the area..and their prices are about the same.  i really wanted to make a funny review about this place. but lets face it. Thai food is seriez bizness, only deserving a serious review."}
