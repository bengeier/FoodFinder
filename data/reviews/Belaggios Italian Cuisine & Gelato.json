{"text":"I really enjoy the veal on a bun with sweet peppers and lots of sauce.  I come on a regular basis and don't understand why it is not rated higher on Yelp.  It's a good place.  I would encourage others to give it a try.  PS   The gelato is terrific."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and panini Excellent gelato. A variety of squares. Excellent place for lunch. Recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Gave me browning lettuce for my salad with chicken..... wont go back"}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place and their gelato for some time now and I'm afraid that they may have oversold the place.  Their pistachio gelato tasted far from pistachio. Their hazelnut gelato, which is what I ended up ordering, was very good however the texture wasn't like the other gelato I've had before.  It seemed a little bit too slushy rather than creamy.    Still glad I tried it but I don't see myself going back here unless a friend picks the place or perhaps if I had a major case of PMS and it was the only thing open (they close much later than the place I prefer to go to)."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Belaggios with a bunch of coworkers for lunch. One of them lives nearby and was saying how great the place was. Their veal sandwiches (aptly called: 'veal on a bun') are the way to go. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until after we had ordered but the 'chicken on a bun' was pretty delicious too.  The sandwich came with tomato sauce, a topping of my choice (I believe the options were hot peppers, sweet peppers, cheese, mushrooms, onion or eggplant) and breaded chicken in a big kaiser roll for $6.75.   They're filling sandwiches so make sure you bring an appetite if you expect to finish it. Check out the picture, you'll see what I mean.    YUM."}
{"text":"It ain't what it use to be.  The veal is very different from when they first opened...it is tough and you wind up pulling entire pieces out of the bun because your teeth can't cut through it.  I hope they change their supplier  because they use to be a real good alternative to California Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just had their Veal Sandwich.  Was extremely quick and made to order.  Delicious.  Certainly worth another visit.   It's suppose to snow heavily today so I won't try the gelato.  But it does look tempting.  I do love gelato so I'll let you know how it is when it gets warmer outside.    They also have an espresso machine so now I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service here. Tried many of the gelato flavours. Pink grapefruit, which I've never seen before, was excellent. Ended up buying a take home for $14.95 filled with salted caramel and chocolate peanut butter.   The meatball sandwich was delicious and filling. Free topping of mushrooms was just the right amount. Not too overpowering. Worth the extra $1 for Provolone. Next time I'd go with the white bun as I found the wheat bun a bit too dense for this sandwich.   Hubby had the Calabrese grilled panini with prosciutto, salami, sweet peppers and mozzarella. Said it was really good.   The sandwiches were about $6.75.   Enjoyed it and will go back again. Convenient location, too."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is not California Sandwiches. That needs to be made clear. It's probably hard to favourably review any Italian sandwich place when you're subconsciously comparing it to California Sandwiches.  Is it good though? Yes. The sandwiches are a good size, amply filled, with a nice sauce - not so much as to make a mess but not dry either.  Because it's close to my office it works out well for me to go there, and reading someone else's comments about there being a California at Vic Park & Eglinton I have to weigh out whether it's worth the extra drive.  Honestly? No. It's still quite decent and a good spot. I've never had any problem with service there nor come away from a meal disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could have given this place a 0 out of 5 stars, I would have.  I love my veal sandwich and since moving to the neighborhood from Woodbridge, my husband and I have been on the hunt for a decent Italian sandwich joint.  Alas, we had the misfortune to step into this place and had what was possibly the worst veal sandwich and panini ever.  Say what you will about their friendly service but our experience was one of annoyance.  3 high school girls giggling behind the counter served us....barely.  The veal sandwich came on a mediocre size kaiser bun about half the size as found in places like California sandwich.  There was barely any tomato sauce as the sauce was way too thin to properly coat the limp and stale veal cutlets.  We also had their romano panini with \"red pepper pesto\" and it was another sad experience.  The salami they used were dry and the red pepper pesto came straight out of one of those store bought jars.  This place is only surviving because it's in Pickering where they're competing with Mr. Subs and Subways.  Next time, I'll just drive the extra 15 min and hit the newly opened California sandwiches on Eglinton and Vic Park."}
{"text":"This review is only based on their coffee and pastry desserts. Grabbed a Hazelnut latte and a scores brownie. I thought the latte had a strange bitter taste and didn't have much hazelnut flavour. I know its coffee and its suppose to have some bitter taste but I have had my fair share of latte's now and its just not the same. Still a decent latte though. Also couldn't stop myself from getting a brownie. There were huge chunks of scores on the brownie which gave it that extra punch of sweetness.   If I didn't have all this sugar already I'm sure I would have grabbed a gelato too since they were displayed so beautifully. Next time for sure when the weather is warmer.  Very friendly service with huge smiles."}
{"text":"I think the cashier for today was asleep. but my cappuccino which she forgot I ordered till I asked her again for it tasted  watered down ..a Canadian coffee would of tasted so much better! Infact it did not taste like even a bad cappuccino today .I have had better cappuccinos from this same location.Lamanna's on kingston rd is a few minutes away ...better selection ,sandwiches  but downfall is that they have a big line up unlike Belaggios the high school teenagers working there does ruin the service ! I paid half by debit the other half by cash . the bill was 16.05 I gave 6 by cash and said I would pay the rest by debit she looked at me like if I was an idiot and asked if I was just placing a dime on debit!! LOL hmmm no their is a 10.05 difference owing to your establishment .Was not the first time ..as a couple of years ago similar situation and that was the last time till today when I went back again. Hmmm ...sorry but I have to agree with Catherine another poster about it.I lived in woodbridge and richmond hill and their is far much better service and food out their"}
{"text":"I have gone twice when I was waiting for my wife to get her nails done in the same plaza.  The deserts are very delicious!  I had a veal sandwich which was tasty, but honesty I'd rather drive down the road 5 minutes to Lamana's at Port Union for a far superior Italian bakery.  Plus the music at Bellagios is blasting like its a night club.     Bellagios is good, nothing really wrong with it, but just not at the same level of some nearby competition.  I would go back if I was waiting at the plaza, otherwise wouldn't think to go there because better options are within reach."}
{"text":"I've only been once but I'll be back for sure, their veal sandwich was absolutely amazing. The tomatoe sauce the veal cuts were dipped in was absolutely wonderful. The veal was cooked well and the toppings - eggplant and mozzarella - tied in with the bun to create a sandwich I'll be back for.   I'm sure everything else they do is wonderful but I'll be back for more veal sandwiches in the future."}
{"text":"Belaggios is located in one of those strip malls on Kingston Road... Unless you live around the area you would never would know it exist or even bother to go there.   -10C with Windchill of -20C.. as I always look for some sweet after my hot yoga session/lunch.. (I always have an excuse for some ice cream). Saw the sign on Belaggios GELATO and a FTR opportunity.. I decided to stop by for my sugar fix.   There are over 16 choices of flavours for Gelato.. I have to say it is quite impressive on a winter weekday.. Who will in the right mind will be eating Gelato?? Ok I am but I am wearing my Down jacket too!   $3.35 for a small Gelato.. Hazelnut tasted A-OK.. It is a lot lighter than the other gelato I had recently.. not as rich.. but still good!   A lot of locals are here buying their sandwiches.. I can see that the sandwiches are huge.. and they were more than happy to cut it in half and served it in 2 plates if you do decide to share...   Services here is nice and friendly. Definitely a nice neighbourhood hang out place, they do serves coffees too!"}
{"text":"My rating is really just based on the location, cleanliness of the restaurant and the service. It's really at 2.5 but I feel generous today. I'd have to give a lower one if food was in the mix. Years ago, this was the only place of its kind in the neighbourhood and it might have gotten 4 stars from me.   Anyway, the servers are alright. The service is always mediocre, towards me, anyway.  I do notice that they're particularly friendly to older white men (just my observation). The place is always clean and mostly inviting. The service is quick, almost like they're chasing you out. Everything I've eaten from there has been mediocre or just okay. I've never had anything twice because nothing stands out.   As for the gelato, well, you can find better in Pickering but theirs certainly isn't the worst.   Final thoughts; check it out. You won't be wowed but it's a great location and the price is right."}
