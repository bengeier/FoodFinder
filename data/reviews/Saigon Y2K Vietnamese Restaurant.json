{"text":"This place has been a Vietnamese staple for friends and family to visit when we want cheap, generally tasty vietnamese.  The service is quick and friendly and the elevator \"hits\" make for a fun musical atmosphere.  Everyone I've eaten there with has generally enjoyed their meat dishes and though they've always had only the lone vegetarian dish (mixed veggies vermicelli), it is well put together, if fairly basic, with lots of veggies that are just cooked enough that they remain crunchy.  Recently, I discovered that they've expanded their vegetarian menu and excitedly tried a new dish, springrolls and shredded tofu on vermicelli.  Mistake.  The noodles and springrolls (deepfried) were fine but the tofu tasted like stale dust (although not being a connoisseur of dust, it could have been quite fresh).  I will perhaps try some of the other veggie dishes my next round but am definitely avoiding the tofu."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Vietnamese food and Y2K does a great job.  

It's clean, which is pretty out of the ordinary, let's be honest.  Plus the food is really tasty.  They make a dynamite pho satay.  The service is quite good and the price point is perfect.

No complaints!"}
{"text":"Totally standard Pho and rice bowls that won't disappoint or wow. A fairly large place that has accommodated our office meals handily. Notable menu item that distinguishes this from other Vietnamese places are the gargantuan and tasty sweet & sour soups (chicken or shrimp) that come with a bucket of rice. A pretty good deal as you will have half of it for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Poor service. I've been to y2k several times. The foods not bad. Once in awhile the kitchen messes up and the service is poor. I ordered pho there the other sat and the soup was luke warm to the point that the rare meat wasn't even cooking. I told them that the soup wasn't hot enough and all they did was reheat the entire bowl. Any Asian noodle shop knows that reheating a bowl of noodles overcooks the noodles and completely ruins it. It was a disaster."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place for pho in the NW. It's close to the university, transit is right there, lots of parking... After 3 years out of Calgary, and returning to my old stomping grounds, I put too much faith in things not changing around here. THIS PLACE CHANGED. Chairs? Tables? nononono.

First of all, okay economy's rough I get it, but the prices have gone up on all their menu items by a couple dollars. Secondly, no cilantro - dafuq?!?! Third, the soup just...... tastes different. Maybe less MSG, who knows. It's not different for the better. This $ ranking is a little deceptive, because let's be honest, who doesn't order spring rolls when they're out for pho, it adds up. 

Probably will avoid this place from now on.. which is quite sad because location-wise.. it really is convenient."}
{"text":"Ordered War Won Ton Soup, steamed rice, and curry chicken.  All dishes were very good.  Service is friendly and attentive.  Decor is clean and tidy."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at Y2K a minimum of twice a month.  Clearly we're big fans.  I didn't rate it \"as good as it gets\" because the service has been hot and cold.  The food is always good.  I usually order the vermicelli with vegetables, and I pay extra to add spring rolls  on top.  The food always arrives quickly.  

Some days the waitresses can be quite unfriendly.  I think it might have to do with how extremely busy they get sometimes and I don't think they like when you veer off the regular menu (subsitutions or extra stuff).  

If you want great Vietnamese food in the North West of Calgary, I highly recommend Y2K.

Tip:  The main parking lot is small, but there is a pretty big parking lot on top of the building that not a lot of people know about. Also, I recommend going early because the place fills up fast."}
{"text":"I have been to Y2K numerous times.  Not having been for a while though, my Husband and I thought we would grab lunch here.  This place is always busy, which is a good sign.  I have even seen local celebrities here before.  We were seated right away, I found the place seemed a bit dirty, our chairs were covered in crumbs, there was some garbage on the floor.  The girl brought us some water and took our order.  Our pops came out quickly, though mine wasn't even filled all the way.  Our food came out in like 5 minutes!  It was not warm at all.  It was like the ingredients were all sitting in the fridge just waiting to be mixed together and go out.  So obviously things aren't made fresh throughout the day.  Nonetheless it was still tasty.  The chicken here is always good.

Since I have tried other Vietnamese places around the city, I find that Y2K's quality of restaurant has gone down to me.  I always feel rushed when I come here, like they want to get you fed and gone so someone else can take your place.  There are other places I would rather go these days."}
{"text":"After circling around the UofC for 15 minutes and enhancing my carbon footprint while looking for a place for lunch (it was after all Sunday), I stumbled upon Saigon Y2K next to McMahon Stadium. The place was dead around 11:30 am on a Sunday so if you're ever in dire need of Vietnamese food around this time you should have no trouble finding a table here. I ordered the, number 26, Rare Beef Pho and a pair of Salad Rolls. Service was quick, but given that there was nobody inside that is to be expected. The pho was ok, nothing to write home about, but satisfying. Enjoyed the Vietnamese love songs playing in the background, high-pitched at times but romantic. 

It's actually a pretty big place and I wondered if it actually got busy, how would one find parking? The lot is small and meant to be shared among other shops within the complex. It was an ok lunch."}
{"text":"Our go to Vietnamese.  Great number 33, beef sate pho.  Very rich broth which I haven't seen elsewhere except for a small lunch spot on 12th ave near the IBM building.  While #33 dominates the more typical vermicelli options leave something to be desired.  Some days they are better than others... you can tell when the noodles are fresh and when they've been sitting in the colander.  If you hit it on a fresh hour I'd give it a 4... when things have been sitting its a 3.  Given that its a block from our place I've been here more than is probably healthy so I've seen my share of good and bad.  You can never complain about the speed though as the food usually hits your table before the waitress has brought your tea."}
{"text":"This past week, we've endured some chilly weather.  So when some friends wanted to meet up for Vietnamese, we said pho'sure!  It was a Sunday of the long weekend, and our attempts at trying out one of the smaller places in the area didn't work out becuase they were closed.  Enter Saigon Y2K.... open 7 days a week, with just slightly reduced hours on holidays.  Yay!  Success!

Mike got the Satay Beef, and I got the Chicken Pho.  I'm sure that there are other places in the city which lay claim to the best soup stock, but we did still enjoy the flavors here.  Mike's wasn't too spicy, but had a nice beefy depth of flavor.  There was a LOT of chicken in mine, and it was really nice lean white meat.  I hate it when the bowls are loaded with sinewy unedible bits, so they definitely met my expectations.  It felt like a never-ending bowl of Pho, filled with lots of noodles, onions, chicken and broth.  By the end, I was stuffed and couldn't even quite finish it.  It was a pretty great deal for an $8.25 lunch.  

The service wasn't overly friendly, but it was fast and efficient.  I was happy with that.  Saigon Y2K certainly warmed me up and cured my Calgary-winter-blues.

{"text":"Regular Vietnamese restaurant with dishes and taste you expect. Inside is clean and staff friendly."}
{"text":"After coming here a few more times I have to say it's just okay.  It's all decent, but that's about it. The food is good (enough), but not great."}
{"text":"Lemon grass beef, chicken & shrimp were dry, seemed over cooked.  Honestly wasn't able to eat anything except noodles & spring rolls.  I'm not a picky eater so I was surprised.  I ignored the reviews and tried for myself.  Spring rolls & noodles were fine."}
{"text":"My main reason for liking this place so much is the music.  They have this terrific soundtrack always going of elevator music versions of movie themes and other epic classical music. It's a great game to play with your table, is to go completely silent, and try to figure out what song is playing.


Other than that, the food is the same as it is in every other Vietnamese place in Calgary. I always order beef and spring rolls on vermicelli, and it's really good."}
{"text":"So you all already know that I'm a pho-ho, and it had been WAAAAY to long since I'd had me some.

Last night a girlfriend introduced me to Saigon Y2K. 

The service was great, the space was nice, the selection was impressive and the speed at which we were served our meal was jaw-dropping.

How was the meal itself you ask? Mediocre. I ordered the Mixed Vegetable Pho, and I gotta be honest, it's nowhere near the best I've ever had. The broth tasted fishy, and the server assured me twice that there was NO meat in my soup, but it didn't taste purely vegetarian to me. Plus there were fried onions in the soup that looked like seafood. I asked almost a half dozen times whether or not they were 'creatures' but the server insisted it was just onion. Since when does onion have the same texture as a sea creature? 

Overall, while the service was great, the food wasn't all that.

I'm gonna keep looking and keep hoping that I find a local pho place to rave about."}
{"text":"I had a seafood soup, which was ok, at least it was hot.
My date had beef pho, very salty, she felt a bit sick after a few spoonfuls.
The place looks really worn out, bathroom, seats, floor, walls are all in need of repair and upgrading. Please have pride about your location, it looks like no one cares. (Saw many holes in the Men's bathroom)
Will not be coming back, unless there are major changes. There are many other places in Calgary which are much cleaner and seem to actually care."}
{"text":"Ugh. This place. SUPER RUDE staff, an owner that hovers over you and has a completely indignant attitude about his menu, and a solitary veg option that is boring as all get out. Walked out and went to the nearby Green Chili Indian restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 2.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

One of the worst places to get Pho. As one of my friends said \"the broth tastes like toilet water\" haha. Even though the portions are huge and you get your money's worth ($8-$9 for a huge bowl of Pho), I suggest you avoid this place if you want 'quality' Pho. One time I couldn't even finish a quarter of my Pho because it tasted like dirty water and ladened with MSG- I actually felt sick from eating Pho for the first time in my life. Other than that, I haven't really tried their other dishes so I would go at your discretion. I can tell you that Vermicelli bowls are around $9-$10 which is average, and $12-$14 for noodle and meat dishes dishes that can be shared family style.

Just a note, their bubble tea drinks are made out of powder which I always avoid - fresh fruit is the way to go!

It's usually very busy, and there is plenty of space and tables to accommodate big or small groups. It's kind of dingy, and their service is a hit a miss. 

Overall, I suggest don't come here to eat. There are much better places around the area that you can go to."}
{"text":"If you're close and starving and in the mood for Viet' this is your best bet.

It's popular amongst the university students too.. it's cheap cheap cheap and you get your fill. 

I could definitely argue I've had better.. but O well it's close to the Uni - don't got many other options. 

service was always vary.. we were always a big group so we didn't mind the wait. 
I liked how it's a pretty big restaurant... enough room to accommodate all their patrons."}
{"text":"I LOVE vietnamese food. I could eat it way too often, and I probably do.

I'm definitely not picky about where I eat, that being said I've had some great viet and some, let's not go there again viet. 

We were at a friends for a later afternoon video game sesh and it was viet night for him and his girl. So we decided to tag along, as I said I hear viet and I'll go. 

I'm slowly getting my hubs into viet, he's never been a big fan. But we're making progress. 

Now I'm the boring eater and get the same thing everytime (I'm also a celiac so I know what I can and can't have). 

I got the charboiled chicken rice vermeicilla with salad rolls. It was perfect. Chicken was tasty, the noodles were cooked nicely and perfect amount of fish sauce.

In regards to service we never had to wait, we got a table right away, they did their usual rounds, got our water, then drinks, then food. It was a perfect quick yummy meal. And best of all, there was 3 of us, we all had a drink, meal and shared an appy and our bill was $40."}
{"text":"When we lived in the neighborhood, we must have visited the restaurant thirty times. The food is good, the service is attentive (never friendly), and we never had to wait long for a table. Recommended."}
{"text":"After a long day traveling we were craving a dinner that was fast, but not fast food. We thought we hit the jackpot when we spotted Saigon Y2K but it proved more of a bust.

I ordered the Pho Ga and my husband ordered the Hu Tieu Saigon Nuoc. We also split an order of vegetarian spring rolls. One of the very few positives of the evening was that the Tiger beer is inexpensive. 

 The spring rolls arrived piping hot which was good, but good only until they were cool enough to taste. I assumed that the spring rolls I ordered were vegetable spring rolls containing just vegetables but I guess I ordered vegetarian spring rolls which include the addition a pasty, gritty mystery substance to a few spartan vegetables. The were, well, nasty.

My Pho Ga was a disaster. A flavorless broth with a pitiful amount of noodles, a few slices of chicken and a chopped scallion floating on top. My accompanying plate of goodies consisted of bean sprouts and a wedge of lime - no basil or cilantro to amp up the flavor volume. My husband's dish appeared to have far more substance to it and was quite loaded down with prawns and \"crab\" but no so much of the other proteins.

I have never expected much in the way of decor at Vietnamese restaurants but this place really cracked me up. The upholstered seat-backs on the chairs had pictures of St. Peter's basilica, the Spanish steps and the Colosseum on them. Makes perfect sense to me.

Maybe this place is called Y2K because that was the last year they served palatable food?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their sate pho. I'm not usually a sate fan since I find most of the places in the city offers sate that's too sweet for my liking. 
But this is the only place in Calgary I will consistently come to just for their sate. I order it on the side of my regular pho and they give me the perfect amount every time. 
Not to mention their portion sizes are HUGE! Cannot get enough of this place.
The only reason I cannot give this place 5 stars is because whenever we take out, the quality goes way down. The sate barely even changes the color of the broth on takeout orders so that's a disappointment. 
I for one am a fan of their tendon, it's not as hard and chewy as some places but reminds me of how we usually cook our tendon at home. 

Definitely would recommend this place for dine-in service with their sate soup, hands down best sate in the city."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were looking for a pho place in the NW and we stumbled upon here. Safe to say, it was absolutely awful. We started off with spring rolls, which tasted frozen and then both ordered beef satay pho. This pho tasted like It was made from goat meat and a mix of feet. The good things about this restauraunt were the guava mints."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while (it's been a little more than a year ago).  Hmmm, now I think I can remember why.   Hubby and I met up with some friends for lunch here today at noon.  It wasn't very busy at all because it was a long weekend.   Even then, it was difficult to catch the attention of a server (there were 3 of them) so we could place our orders.   
      I ordered the fried quail as an appy and the rice noodles with barbecued pork, shrimp balls, fake crab, squid and shrimp (with a 250 ml bowl of broth on the side).  The quail was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  However, I thought it needed a little more salt and the lime-black pepper dipping sauce was a bit too heavy on the pepper.   My rice noodle bowl with the side bowl of broth/soup came to the table lukewarm.  The shrimp balls and pork were flavourful, but the squid was overcooked (a bit rubbery) and the shrimp was cold and undercooked (translucent in the middle).

One server(who looked like the co-owner) offered to pack up the remainder of the quail and other leftovers.   Actions are louder than words; she never returned to our table again... (and the restaurant was only one-thirds full).   We asked another server (daughter?) for styrofoam containers.  She was not very good at multi-tasking; the table next to us also asked her for an extra spoon--she walked to the kitchen to get the spoon but completely forgot about us and the containers, as well!  I had to walk up to the kitchen to get the containers myself.

My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the NW is still Bowness Vietnamese.  Sorry, Saigon Y2K."}
{"text":"Food is okay, I like the soup but vermicelli dish should be more tasty in my opinion  
Service is excellent:)"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Solid place to eat. Food is very good but portions of chicken/beef lacking. So if extra hungry (ie large hungry man) this place may only satisfy you for a short time. No problems with the service. Food comes out hot and without too much of a wait. If in the area, I would consider making a return trip. Not the best in town but it holds its own."}
{"text":"How can I place keep on going down hill endlessly?

Pho is the worst in the city. Slimy texture in texture, cloudy in appearance, and musky in taste - the soup base reflects the lack of care to this fundamental dish in Vietnamese cuisine. The sliminess and musky flavour is a result, I suspect, from adding the beef tripe and tendons to the preparation of the broth. This is absolutely wrong and outright sloppy/lazy. 

The noodles, like the broth, was sloppy and over cooked. 

To make matters worse, the bean sprouts were old and grey, the basil and lim were past its shelf life and the chilli peppers were frozen (wtf!)!!!

Vietnamese food is desired for its freshness and this place disappoints. 

Not recommended."}
{"text":"It's a \"reliable\" choice I've known for years, and while it's not the ultimate Vietnamese place, what I've tried here has been pretty decent, e.g. satay chicken soup, grilled prawns on rice vermicelli, etc. Perfectly fine for groups, but depending on the server you might get a bit of pushback on accommodating separate bills."}
{"text":"Visited from Toronto. Spacious, nice restaurant for an inexpensive meal. Located near a number of inns/hotels and offers a cheaper and more delicious eat in my opinion. There isn't much else around the area though, but I think if you're around and hungry, this place would be great!

Comfortable seating and nice staff as well. Would come back if I were to be in the area. Portions were enormous for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with mum, sis and neice, when we couldn't decide what we felt like and decided pho would keep us all happy. neice has mastered chopsticks! 

The three of us has the same pho tai and tea and the little one had a small bowl of noodles from her mum's bowl. Tasted good.

Decor was dated, stereotypical plastic flowers, art bought in bulk, like 1988.  I had no complaints until ten minutes after we left the restaurant, and I had to ask my sister to pull over so I could be sick at the side of the road. Seriously.

As we all had the same thing, I can only assume it was a bad piece of beef or a rouge sprout, but I will never stop there again. Had to rush home and change. Not good."}
{"text":"Great service. We visit all the time. The special fried rice is phenomenal as is the Pho. Way better than the downtown location.  Not the same at all despite the name. Hit up the mall after, it's across the street."}
{"text":"I am from Australia and we have probably been to 2 Vietnamese restaurants a week for the last 4 weeks and this is by far my favourite! The pho is amazing and super full of flavour. Me and my partner both agree it's the best broth that we have had so far!
The Vietnamese coffee is a must. 
Friendly staff too :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this restaurant for over a decade. Sadly  tonight I ordered takeout and there was an error with my order. Not really a problem ...I called when I got home, in the 20 minutes it took me to drive there they hadn't even started my correct order. Then proceeded to yell at me, for their error. Threatening to charge me twice. I highly recommend going somewhere else. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"A cut above your standard Vietnamese restaurant.  It has all of the staples - pho, vermicelli/rice-noddles, fried rice, Vietnamese spring rolls, etc. - but they are all above average."}
{"text":"I've previously commented that Vietnamese restaurants basically can do no wrong, but I've found one that epic failed.  

My lunch partner was running late, so upon being seated I was brought water and was not once asked if I wanted anything else while I waited, which turned out to be a half hour.  During this time, I became highly irritated by the blasting music and actually asked them to lower the volume.  They did and immediately I could tell that other patrons weren't talking so loudly anymore.  

Once my friend arrived we had to flag a server to take our order because we certainly received no attention.  Our food arrived quickly, but everything about my noodle bowl was completely flavorless.  I had asked for the lemongrass chicken and the chicken was naked.  I was stunned at how bad my meal was because I've never experienced this in a Vietnamese restaurant before.

Our visit turned into two hours and the remainder of our food sat on the table with us for that long as well.  We were ignored until we again flagged a server to remove the food, as we were ready to leave.  The man who assisted me with paying my bill was not friendly.  It took all I had to leave a tip and I'll never go back if I can help it."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant because it was recommended by our hotel front desk worker and its proximity to our hotel (we just walked out the back door of our hotel and we were there.) Usually I don't really like Vietnamese food, and Saigon Y2K did not change my mind.

Everything we ordered was just a bit too salty. The curry chicken would have been great if it weren't so salty, and the same applies to the satay beef soup. Besides that, there is nothing that is too remarkable about this restaurant--our server was pretty good; he even memorized all of our orders. We didn't get any water refills, though. Overall, it was a very average experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Saigon Y2K in particular.  It's got great food (like they all do), nice people, and a great atmosphere.

Unlike some other Saigon's, this place has a more comfortable feel to it.  It's got cute decorations as well as comfy seats and large tables.  It's perfectly suited for a large group of people, but is also great if you're dining alone or with just one other person.

I find that the workers of this Saigon Y2K are exceptionally friendly.  You are always greeted and served with a smile.  Upon entry you will receive a big \"hello\" from whoever is behind the counter, which makes you feel right at home.

Just like the other ones, the prices at this location are pretty good.  You can bet that you'll be stuffed to the brim for under $15 a person.  If you're drinking, the booze can get a little pricey, but that goes for anywhere you visit.

Normally, I'm more of a North girl, but this South location breaks all the rules.  It's a little tricky to get to (unless you're coming North up MacLeod) but it's worth the trip every time!"}
{"text":"I can probably sum up the experience at Saigon Y2K in three words: friendly, fast and tasty.

Let's start with friendly.  The people at this location are always extremely personable and very eager to please.  I received the wrong dish on one occasion and they were not reluctant to take it back and correct the error.  It seems that everyone in this restaurant, cooks and hostess included, just really enjoy what they do and it really comes across in their service.  Great job people of Saigon!

Next we move onto fast.  This is by no means a fast food restaurant, but you won't be waiting for 25 minutes for your food to arrive.  It all comes to you pretty quickly, no matter what you order.  This isn't to say that the food isn't fresh.  Everything is prepared exactly to order but in record time.  I love how Saigon combines the experience of a dine-in restaurant with the hastiness of fast food.

And finally we reach tasty.  My goodness do these guys know how to make a wicked special fried rice.  It's by far my favourite and always on my list when ordering from this place.  I usually like to try other things as well as the rice, but it's always top choice.  The prices of the food aren't unreasonable either.  For the amount of food you get I actually think the prices are pretty damn good.

Saigon Y2K seems to meet the three standards required of a restaurant.  Good service, great timing and unbelievable food makes Saigon Y2K 3 for 3... yippy!"}
{"text":"This Saigon Y2K is in a convenient location, near the Stadium and the University.  Parking is free and right in front of the restaurant.  

For appetizers, try their Imperial roll - it's so good - it's shrimp and taro and looks like a spring roll.  Eat with that sweet chili sauce.  

The food is pretty good.  I usually have no. 40 - the tossed egg noodles with pork, seafood and cilantro in a hoisin sauce with soup on the side.  

For dessert - try the green bean, red bean Vietnamese dessert on ice!  Cools you right off on a hot day like today!  

The service is pretty good and the food comes out fast."}
{"text":"My husband, mom and myself came here because our fav Vietnamese restaurant was closed. The first impressions was the dated decor and the wait for someone to notice us before being seated. It took 15 minutes for someone to come by to take our drink order, the food was so-so and they forgot about one of our appetizers until we were done eating. It then took over 10 minutes to get the bill and then my husband had to go find someone to get change. I'm pretty easy going and not picky when it comes to service, and I understand it was near the end if the night but this was the worst service I've ever experienced. Do yourself a favor and go to Lemongrass Grill across from Chinook Station instead."}
