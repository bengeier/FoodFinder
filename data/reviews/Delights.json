{"text":"This place is excellent for breakfast! The food is good at a decent price.  I've been here a few times and tried the Breakfast BLT ($12), Eggs + Meat (Scrambled & Sausage - $14), and the Baked Raspberry Lemon Pancakes ($10) for breakfast.   For lunch I've tried the Tuscan Chicken Panini ($13) and the Tuna Melt ($11). The Tuscan Chicken Panini was good, but I prefer the Tuna Melt over it. The food is perfect if you're on the go. Each time I've eaten here I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes to get my food. Pretty quick!"}
{"text":"As delicious as it looked. Would have submitted a photo but we ate it all too fast. Breakfast simply taken to the next level! This could compete with any of the big name chefs on the strip."}
{"text":"its a pain in the ass to get to but its ok. had monte cristo sand was good and the girl behind counter was nice . not worth a return trip unless im like right there."}
{"text":"Try the smoothies, they are freshly made and delicious! Also for Breakfast, order the Melrose Ave wrap with scrambled egg whites, turkey bacon and whole wheat tortilla... Add the Gouda cheese to this delightful meal!"}
{"text":"Fugg this place! I Was here 12/24/14. Our room wasn't ready yet so we went in to kill time.  I got a latte and slice of banana nut brand. The total came to $9.19. I used my debit card. I added on a $2.00 tip to the bill. So the transaction should have cleared as $11.19.   A few minutes later I casually checked my account via my phone. I see that they charged me $9.19 AND $11.19. So my card was ran for the original amount AND the amount with the added on tip. Argh  OK so I immediately went back to the counter. The girl said one was a \"ghost\" charge and would for sure drop off. So I was fine with that explanation and let it go.   On 12/26 both charges cleared my account. Neither charge dropped off. Both were charged to me and cleared. However now the original amount of $9.19 has cleared as $9.26. Nonetheless, I paid $20.45 for one latte and a slice of banana nut bread. Wow. That is some expensive shit.   I dreaded dealing with this. I hate having to point out monetary mistakes to others like this. But I had my receipt still, so I was hoping the people would be cool and smart enough to quickly and easily remedy the situation. It was just $9.26 too much...but it just didn't sit right with me to just sit back and allow them to double charge me.   So on the day we were checking out, 12/27, I went down there. The place was packed. But I found someone standing off to the side that I thought I could talk to. Her name was Rosalia. She was very nice. She listened to what happened. She took my receipt and told me she was going to the back to call the manager who wasn't in that day. Fine. She was back there for about 10 minutes. She comes back and tells me that the manager, Jennifer Fur, said it WILL drop off within 48 hours. I kept repeating that this charge was NOT still pending. It had already cleared the day before on the 26th. So there was no way it would just drop off my account. It was past that step. They would need to credit it back to my account. But Rosalia was adamant that it would drop because her manager Jennifer said it would.   Well, I was checking out. I knew that nothing would be done right then. They were either very sure that I didn't know what I was talking about when I said both transactions had already cleared my account and they really believed the transaction would truly drop off my account OR they were just saying whatever to get my ass out of there. Lol Either way, I left and decided to play along.  Rosalia gave me hers and Jennifer's names and the direct # to Delights and told me if the transaction didn't drop by the following Tuesday, call back and either of them would take care of it.  I got busy this week. I didn't call Tuesday. I just called today, Friday. At first I asked for the manager, Jennifer. Whoever answered said she wasn't in today. So then I asked for Rosalia. She was gone for the day. Great. So I kind of relayed why I was calling. The girl put me on hold for another manager. I waited for 10 minutes on hold...nobody ever came on. So I hung up and called back.  So then the girl tells me she will give me the direct number to the manager's office and puts me on hold again. She comes back...puts me on hold again...comes back again...then puts me on hold AGAIN. Then out of the blue...Jennifer, the manager, picks up.   Her tone was very much like, \"What do you want bitch?!?!?\" Lol I could tell she didn't give a damn about my situation and just wanted me to go away.   So she asks me for the check number and a call back number. I give it to her. She calls me back about 15 minutes later with the conclusion that I have already been refunded the original amount and there was nothing for her to do. It was already done.  Hmmmm...interesting....because it's not showing up on my account at all. I have a really good feeling that this is all bullshit and a refund will never show up. But she says I should give it around 3 business days. So I agreed to this.   At this point, I'm so frustrated because the manager was so damn dismissive. As I said, I highly doubt anything has already been refunded. But if I get shamed and it DOES show up within 3 days, I will change my review.   But in the meantime, the manager offered no apology. And let's face it, they messed up the transaction somehow. I shouldn't have to pay double for a latte and piece of bread. So apologize to me. Act like you care about customer service!! Is that so hard? I guess so. Because she had an 'I don't give a damn' tone. I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm being petty or a nuisance because I want my refund on some shit YOUR establishment fugged up!!!! WTH??  I'm probably not getting a refund and I'm not calling back. Too much bullshit. But I learned a lesson. Don't use your debit card at Delights. Don't add on a tip if you do use your debit card. And just skip this place and next time, take my ass onto Starbucks down the hall. I could have gotten a better latte for cheaper in a bigger cup. Smh"}
{"text":"Takes forever even when place is empty. Good food and drinks but painfully slow. We were refunded our money because we almost missed our tour bus waiting for a breakfast sandwich. If you have time to kill, check it out!"}
{"text":"You go in and it looks great.  The pastries look like real french pastries.  The food is well arranged.  The menu is compelling.   Give the the spicy sausage sandwich with roasted peppers-I ask.   Whoops-tasted like a cheap hot dog-not spicy at all-with some canned peppers.  Not good.    Coffee was great, though."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. The signature scramble was delicious. I actually got it as is and then the next morning for it in a wrap. It was good either way. The potatoes were on point. If you stay at the Signature hotel is a short walk away from all the towers."}
{"text":"A quaint little bistro in Tower 2 of the MGM Signature Hotel. They were very accommodating for my special vegetarian orders. The food was good. We got it \"to go\" both times. The staff is friendly and efficient. There are lots of tables inside and right outside the door are tables outside where you can eat as well. In the morning and afternoon it was quite busy, but they moved everything along. Solid choice to grab a meal inside the hotel."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in three days.  First time was good.  Egg breakfast and OJ.  Second time was marginal.  Arrived just before close and ordered the breakfast burrito.  Took way too long and they didn't have all the correct ingredients.    Why you may ask did they get four stars?  They apologized several times and gave me free food to make up for the order and delay.  i was impressed with their willingness to make me happy.  Bravo!  Price is a little high, but it always is when you eat in Vegas, in the hotel."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. Really only b/c its convenient when I want a quick bite and don't feel like venturing out for food. I mainly get the beet salad and the kale salad.. You can get 3 salads for $16. They are side salads so not that big. But good if you get 2-3. They are $6 each.  I hadn't been in a while so once again after my workout I needed a quick healthy-fish bite to eat. I must say I am a little disappointed with the salads. They have changed a bit. Now I will say the display are now more accurate with the portions, (I would like to think that's due to my review...lol), however the salads do not taste as good as they did before.   Let's start with the beer salad.. The beets are cut larger which is cool but not as tender as they were before. Even after I cut up the beets they were still hard.  And all and all just not tastey like it was before. Then there is a lot of big chunks of onions which I feel are not necessary.   Now for the kale salad. It is suppose to already have the dressing on it, however it was very little I had the dump the salad out and mix it around so that it at least got on most of the kale. And I am not a person who likes a salad drowning in dressing, however,  I do like it coated just enough to taste on every bite  also the kale was not tender at all. I think if it would have had more dressing on it for little long it would have soften it up. The kale wasn't really cut up that much so if you don't like eating g huge leaves then you have to take time to cut it up. Which isn't a problem if you have the time to do so. It's just a less than average salad, it also has a baby carrot in it but only one whole one which I don't understand the purpose of it. And the dressing they have on the kale is very bland.   So for to have someone of a decent lunch, I mixed the 2 salads together to make one which helped. Other than that it was just ok. I will say I don't know if I will get these salads again and that's sad b/c they were my go to salads..  So all in all this place stays a solid 3*s it's not bad place to grab a bite, but it isn't the greatest spot if you have time to venture out and get something to eat."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered. Told the wait would be 20 minutes. Watched everyone that came after us (6 different people) receive their orders first. Apparently, our order was given to someone else or skipped entirely. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Located right outside the elevator of Tower 2 in The Signature (at MGM), the main draw of this place is fast, quality food. The sign right outside of the door drew us in--a truffle cheeseburger sounded delicious. At $17, we thought it would be well worth it.  Here, you order your food Corner Bakery style. Then they give you a number and you wait for them to bring your food. Well, we started off with the cheese tortellini salad. It tasted decent, but was expecting more flavor from it. At the same time, we ordered the truffle cheeseburger, a ham and brie panini and the soup of the day which happened to be mushroom soup.  A long stretch of time passes by, about 30-35 minutes. Luckily, we had the salad to hold us over. To our surprise, our lunches came out first. We weren't particularly impressed with the sandwich as there was too much ham, and slightly a little brie. It tasted ordinary if you ask me. I then got the burger. The fries looked great--I think they were sprinkled with a little parmesan. Anyhow, after I took my first bite, the table noticed that my medium burger was anything but that. It was generally all pink inside and very unsuitable to eat. In retrospect, looking at the photo I took (see photos), you can see part of the bun is bloody!  We asked a server to come by to take a look and she seemed unfamiliar with how it should appear. We also took this time to ask our soup that never arrived. The waitress comes back and takes our semi eaten burger back to the restaurant. At this point, I am thinking, something MUST be comped.  As we are sitting there, a burger was served to another fellow who arrived way after we had. At last my burger comes, and its only decent. There is only a hint of truffle flavor in the burger (it was all in the mayo) but aside from this uniqueness, the rest of the burger was just your standard fare, nothing special about it. After these were all eaten up, our soup came out and we didn't get to truly appreciate it.  The bottomline... the hotel itself is very nice, too bad that it didn't expand into the doors of the hotel's deli. If you are going to serve me raw meat, I am going to expect something more than just a hello."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Delights in previous trips, but we skipped it this time.  The menu has been greatly reduced and the prices have gone up.  A simple coffee is now $4, a 12-oz fountain soda filled of ice is $5, and a tiny bottle of Fiji water or Pellegrino is $6!    Food is more reasonable, but those prices are just unconscionable."}
{"text":"Deli shop located in the Signature. This was a perfect breakfast option when I was too lazy to go out for breakfast. They make a really good white chocolate french toast and their breakfast wraps are pretty legit as well. Lunch experience was great too.  Signature guests will definitely appreciate the convenience of this place and the food quality is decent. It's a little more expensive than I would have liked, but what isn't expensive in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Signature this past weekend so we went to Delights for a post night of drinking meal, and it was good.   I got the Las Vegas Blvd sandwich ( I think that's the one I got) it was a sandwich with Skirt steak, fried egg, caramelized onions, and a sauce. It was so good, my only real complaint is the proportions are kind of small and it's a bit pricey.   I paid $12 for a sandwich but it was a really good sandwich so no real complaints."}
{"text":"If you're stuck in the hotel and need something easy and quick, this place will work. Across the hall from tower 2 elevators, it has options for everyone. $5 for bad coffee, at least it's all you can drink.   Grilled veggie panini was pretty good. House salad was okay. I asked for chicken vs smoked salmon and the chicken was incredibly dried out. But the greens were at least fresh."}
{"text":"***Delights' breakfast BLT was nothing exceptional and it was also not gourmet despite the gourmet price, but it was a satisfying enough quick breakfast at The Signature in the MGM Grand***  Delights Gourmet Delicatessen is a little quick order sandwich spot in The Signature area of the MGM Grand.  Because of its location in The Signature, Delights feels a little tucked away and not your typical Vegas spot--not overwhelmingly busy, very far from the smoke and spacious.  They feature breakfast and sandwiches as well as a few lighter options like parfaits and fresh fruit.  I had the breakfast BLT, which consisted of a fried egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on sourdough toast.  Their breakfast BLT did not compare with breakfast BLT or BLT-esque sandwiches at Nickel Diner (great sauce, great bread, leafy arugula) or Huckleberry (very good runny egg, thick and meaty bacon), but Delights' breakfast BLT was still satisfying.  All of the ingredients were good.  The sandwich had a good flavor.  The bacon was not the best quality, but it was crispy and flavorful.  The lettuce was crisp and the mayo provided a creaminess to the sandwich.  The sourdough toast was a little thin, but it was still decent.  Overall, it was a pleasant though not exceptional breakfast sandwich.  The sandwich came with a side of fruit, which was just okay.  Service was quick.  Prices were high.  The sandwich was $12.  I would expect to pay that much (and maybe even a little less) for a gourmet sandwich and Delights' version was definitely not up to the standards of what they serve at Huckleberry (which is actually less than $10).  Still, it is Vegas and food tends to be overpriced; for Vegas, the price was not too unreasonable considering the portion size.  Delights is an okay spot.  While overpriced, it is still nice to have a decent enough breakfast in Las Vegas for under $15.  While Delights is probably not a place where I would make a return visit, I would consider coming here again if I was in a hurry, in the area and in need of a quick bite.  MGM Grand offers both parking via valet and self-parking.  The Signature offers valet parking as well."}
{"text":"I came in for breakfast on my last morning in Vegas, and from what I had remembered, I really liked this restaurant...I was wrong!!  They were out of fresh fruit completely, so no smoothies. Then I asked her how their baked pancake dish was (which was supposed to be made with lemons and raspberries)...and the lady at the register said it was \"VERY good!\" I went with her word as there weren't too many veggie dishes on the menu. It looked beautiful, but it was AWFUL! Somehow it was dry and undercooked...and the raspberries were literally sour. Which I should have known, seeing as how she said they were out of FRESH fruit. Ugh.   Also, upon asking for water with my breakfast she charged me 4 dollars and brought out a tiny little Fuji bottle. Forget this place...there's much better in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Giving an extra star for service and nice patio area. The serving sizes of the food are big but it was just ok. Had a breakfast wrap and it was tasteless. The skillet was the same.  Had to supplement with salt and pepper"}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel, looking for a good place to eat breakfast with my wife. Decided to give this place a chance and so glad we did! Las Vegas blvd was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had, wife had eggs and chicken sausage which was delicious! Affordable too"}
{"text":"In case you want to avoid walking for 10 minutes for food in the Strip, this is a great place to go. Luckily, my room was in Tower 2 so all I had to do was go down and it'd be right there off of the elevators. Their breakfast was delicious; I had the ordinary eggs, bacon, and potatoes breakfast. The food was served beautifully, and it tasted even better. The best part was the bacon...cooked just right and had a very different taste from other bacon I've had before. It was just a little pricey, but then again, it's located in the Signature.   The service was a little lacking though. It looked somewhat busy, but we had to wait a while to get our check, and even that took a little effort on our part. Besides that, the service was on par for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad. While the wifey and I only tried breakfast, the rest of the menu looked interesting (like Salmon pizza). It was fairly decent, I feasted on the Eggs Any Style breakfast and the misses ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich. The smoked salmon was a hit and the Eggs any style was just as you would expect. The eggs any style comes with homestyle potatoes (good stuff!), meat and toast...pretty fulfilling. Prices are high, but you should expect it for the convenience and city location.  Update: 1/24/11  I recently revisited this deli and I'll keep it at three stars.  They took the Salmon Bagel sandwich off the menu, but now offer it in a DIY boxed version which is still good! My kids had the french toast which I sampled and it was awesome! It came with white chocolate additions and a really good whip cream topping! This french toast is a must have!!!!"}
{"text":"Half and Half   Walked in here with a big hunger in my belly...  And discovered the Best Tomato Bisque I've ever had. I swear it was cooked by a Michelin Chef. From presentation to taste, I challenge you to find a better tomato bisque.  Oddly, the Caesar salad tasted like it was made by that same chefs ten year old child. I could have made a better salad using grass and bark.   All things considered, the soup was so good, I'd be happy to go back for the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Located in Tower 2 of the Signature Towers at the MGM Grand, Delights is one of the few close dining options you have as a visitor. It's very convenient because it's located right next to elevator when I come down to the lobby. However, the food is just decent, and I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon.  Came here twice to grab a quick brunch. It's not exactly a fast cafe here. They seem understaffed, as there was a very long line and only 2 people working the cashiers. It took 20 minutes to get my order during both of my visits (so definitely expect a wait here, it's not a fast food place by any means).  I ordered the Chicken Caesar wrap and the Signature scramble.  Chicken caesar wrap- this was decent and it also came with a potato salad. I enjoyed my meal, but the experience was more of needing food for subsistence, rather than a nice dining option.  signature scramble- really attractive plating for this dish. The food was okay but I still enjoyed it. The scrambled eggs were slightly overcooked, but the dryness was saved by the salsa added underneath.  Overall, Delights is a decent dining option if you needed a meal and didn't want to venture off to the Strip. Just expect to wait about 20-30 minutes to get your food; it's not a fast food place."}
{"text":"Delights is a small cafe located in the Signature side of MGM, tower 1. They tend to have more of a breakfast/lunch menu with sandwiches, soups, scrambles, and a little twist with huevos rancheros. If you are staying in the signature, this is the most convenient option. You can dine in or take to go.  The prices are a little steep for what you are getting, but food is decent with a lot of healthy options and customer service is excellent! I came in one morning with a Very specific order and was helped by Rosalia, the next morning she had my order memorized! As well as the order of the woman in front of me. I was very impressed. She was also super friendly and accommodating with my special request on my order.  Definitely recommend if you are staying in the Signature!"}
{"text":"Sadly when the new management company took over the MGM Signature, they also took over the cafe.  All of the food there is still pretty good, but the menu is completely changed.  Feels more like they cater more to adult tastes but the prices are still reasonable.  Instead of the gelato, they have a beer on tap.  And while that's not bad, this is Vegas.  I can literally walk  30 feet and get a beer or any other alcoholic drink but I cannot get gelato.    A short walk down there's even a full bar, so I don't see the point in getting rid of the gelato."}
{"text":"Great service and good tasting breakfast food.  The portions are not huge but they do them well. Service is great and if you buy coffee you can get refills all day as long as you carry the receipt. Try the raspberry pancakes and chicken sausage."}
{"text":"At first, wasn't so sure about this place.  We were living for a tour first thing in the morning and had been scouting out places for a quick nourishing bite in the nearest area. Found this little gem after closing hours, so couldn't see the menu from across the dark room area.  We decided to give it a try and am very glad we did. We had the wrap sandwich with fruit and Mr had had the eggs and meat dish.  Both were served quickly, correctly and were delicious!  A non loud cafe for first thing, busy and got everyone their orders fast with a smile.  Will try this one again!!"}
{"text":"Delights Cafe just started serving breakfast the week we arrived for our stay at The Signature.  They offer a selection of baked goods, sandwiches, salads, and gelato/ice cream, along with drinks and other snack items.  We were highly impressed with the quality of their food.  During our stay we ordered lox on flatbread, brioche french toast ham-and-swiss panini, and the forest mushroom quiche -- all delicious and all prepared fresh.  We also had yogurt and fruit parfaits every morning.  Since you do have to wait while they prepare your meals, you can just relax outside on the patio that faces toward The Signature's private pool area on a nice day or inside the pleasant cafe itself.  You'll find Delights Cafe in Tower 2.  It's a good value for the non-dinnertime Vegas-splurge, and very convenient while staying at The Signature."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast, and ordered pizzas for lunch to go.  Food was great.  They have a wide variety of options and as a vegetarian I had many choices.  Portions are somewhat small for the price, but it is Vegas so that is to be expected.  Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Lunch on Friday, 8/7/15  Located inside the Signature MGM hotel, there's a small cafe that serves delicious sandwiches and other delights. Service was average.  I usually visit this place during convention so it gets pretty busy. Their items are on the pricey side but again, this is Vegas.  My favorite item so far is the blackened chicken sandwich. It comes warmed up with a side dish and a pickle. I tried the coleslaw which was drenched in the sauce so I decided to get a bag of chips the second time around. My co-workers would order the pizza and they say it's delicious. They also have a variety sandwiches with eggs, a small alcoholic selection of drinks, and snacks to purchase located along the wall.   I would recommend this place for lunch if you're not in a big hurry. It's a nice sit down place with outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Their scrambled eggs were gross and their potatoes that cone with the egg & meat dish were cold and stale!"}
{"text":"Since there's not much that's close to Signature, Delights would be your only choice if you didn't feel like traveling far to grab a bite. Food is ok along with a decent selection for breakfast & lunch but the service is slowwwwww. Had ordered 2 sandwiches that took 25 mins to come out. The place had 4 people in it.    Prices are a bit high but it's Vegas. 4 dollars for Fiji water? Jeebus. They also have beer & wine here. The place sits about 15 to 25."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and make a point to come EVERY time I found myself in Vegas. All because of the amazing blackened chicken sandwich they had. One of my very favorites I've ever had in my life. I've told friends, family, colleagues. Like a crazy woman! But I just went there on November 4th and found that there was a new chef, new menu. All with no blackened chicken sandwich. Mind you, I heard it was also one of the best selling sandwiches they had. WHY would the idiot new chef take that, among other well-selling items, off the menu?! Now the menu seems boring and generic for lunch options. I would like to formally complain and tell the chef to suck it. BUT I am giving two stars as opposed to less, for the excellent ladies at the register/who served me as they were sweet, attentive and sympathetic to my plight! Thank you ladies! And shame on you, chef :P"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Signature and had 4 meals at this restaurant. We loved everything we tried. The breakfast was amazing, the desserts were awesome, and they had really good lunch sandwiches. We definitely think this is a must try if you stay at the Signature."}
{"text":"If your staying in or near tower 2 at The Signature at MGM Grand Delights is a convenient place for some good food. I was immediately impressed by the customer service, very polite and friendly. The food was delivered promptly and it was good. I had the eggs breakfast. Yum! Very close to the pool and a couch outside where you can lounge and chat. It was $20 for a good breakfast...maybe a lil spendy but overall I'd go again."}
{"text":"Decided to use up a free comp offer at Delights and was actually impressed with the Las Vegas Blvd breakfast sandwich.. very tasty and good quality!  The staff at Delights were very nice and relaxed.. the atmosphere was quiet in the morning and crazy as it sounds yes you can buy beer here at any time.. nothing like a New Castle Brown Ale and Las Vegas Blvd breakfast sandwich to start the day off at 830 am lol.. but hey it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"Located in Tower 2 of The Signature at MGM Grand. I can't really imagine anyone making the trek over from The Strip...but if you do, you won't be disappointed.   Luckily for me, we were staying in Tower 2 lol. The yogurt parfait with the mixed berries was so good. And I hate yogurt with a fiery passion. The breakfast potatoes are also very tasty. Oh and the caprese salad.   Service was fantastic and friendly!"}
{"text":"Really excellent food and so convenient since it was in tower we stayed in. I had the chicken caesar salad wrap, my sister had the breakfast BLT, and our friends had the cinnamon and white chocolate french toast and other breakfast items. The home fries that came with the breakfasts were sooo good, very crunchy and nicely flavored with seasoned salt. The food is somewhat pricey, but I guess most things are in Vegas =)"}
{"text":"I was not a guest at this property, but I saw this place on yelp. Since it was very close I decided to give it a try. Convenient for guests, but you have to ask the guards to open the security gate to let you in if you're not a guest. Not a huge deterrent, if the breakfast had been worth it. It was pricey for just mediocre food. I had the scrambled skillet. If I wasn't trying to eat healthy, I would have tried the chocolate french toast or lemon raspberry pancakes. Maybe those would have been better."}
{"text":"Love this little spot! Is it bc I'm extremely lazy and don't want to wander over to the MGM for eats? Nope (well...) This place earns the name 'gourmet deli'. While the menu is tight, the sandwich combos are well thought out. The prices? Not great. Am I against $10 egg sammies? Sure. But when it's the Melrose Avenue (scrambled egg whites, sliced avocado, fire-roasted diced tomatoes, mushrooms & turkey bacon in a whole wheat wrap), you can look past the inflated price tag. Also, an $8 chili better be the best chili ever...and it kinda was. Not your average heavy, oiled up sloppy joe in a bowl, this was more of a Manhattan clam, meets minestrone, meets vegetarian chili and it was damn good. The Chinese chicken salad was decent, but probably a skip the next time around.   My suggestion? Come here (if you're in the area) for HH, where the pizzas are half price and the brews are $2.50. Staying at the Signature? Don't hesitate to have a few meals here when you're in a rush. Nothing on the menu is over $12."}
{"text":"They probably have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had... in life.   I love how convenient this place is. I stayed in Tower 2 and whenever I had a craving for some real food and not want to wait in line for a buffet or stuff my face with junk food, I'd just come downstairs.   PROS: - BOURBON ST. sandwich. Hands down best sammich I've ever had.  - MARKET ST. sandwich. Very close second.  - Huge portions. - Choice of fruit cup or potato salad with sandwich.   CONS:  - It takes FOREVER to get your food. Sometimes 20mins.  - Those sandwiches are $12. Most expensive sandwich I've ever had.  - Breakfast is not their forte. I ordered the southwest scramble for breakfast  I paid $15 for plain wheat toast, scrambled eggs, a dollop of sour cream and a fruit salad.   If I come back. I am definitely ONLY coming back for the Bourbon or the Market. Everything else is irrelevant."}
{"text":"We are owners at the signature and used to come to this restaurant frequently for their wonderful breakfast skillets. We would enjoy them with mimosas and get coffee. One of the things I really liked about the restaurant where their breakfast potatoes. This morning we came down and ordered breakfast and were served tater tot's. I eat gluten-free. I cannot eat tater tot's.   My Huevos rancheros was served with ice cold cheese, and ice cold pepper, something that resembled refried beans, I'm not sure what it was because I didn't eat it, a big pile of tater tot's and an overcooked egg.   My husband ordered a $14.00 Denver omelette, it is not on the menu but they say they can make omelettes. I was told they don't have peppers for the omlette...whaaaat? What about the cold pepper served with my Huevos Rancheros? Go figure that one.   I returned my breakfast informing them that I cannot eat tater tot's because I have to eat Gluten Free foods. They remade my breakfast and omitted the corn tortilla. Newsflash chef! Corn tortillas are gluten-free. My second breakfast also arrived with ice cold cheese, and ice cold pepper, and over cooked egg, something that resembled refried beans and no tortilla.  By the time I received my second breakfast my husband was almost finished eating his tasteless rubbery scrambled eggs which I assume were poured out of a container. The eggs sucked so badly that my dogs would not even eat them.   Signature managers! We are in Las Vegas, people like to have mimosas with their breakfast in Las Vegas what happened to the champagne? Get with the program people!"}
{"text":"The Signature Towers are in my Vegas hood, so I was happy to see the Deli downstairs by the pool.  We both have asthma, and love the smoke free Signatures for their clean air, and lack of gaming racket.   The Deli serves up firefighter sized hearty breakfast fare, as well as sandwiches and snacks. They would have four stars if they still served their salmon pizza, but the last time I was there, they had started serving the lox on the traditional bagel, and it was a decent breakfast feast. The deli mostly serves Signature clients, but can be accessed by the long tunnel connecting them to the MGM casino."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch from them. The pizza is slightly over done but still tastes good. Chicken salad is tossed just right. If you stayed in the Signature towers and need a quick bite, this place is surprisingly good compared to other vacation condos I've stayed."}
{"text":"Delights is a nice place to get a quick breakfast or lunch for those who want a less loud Vegas experience. Wendy the server was very kind, happy, and friendly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"kinda pricey for a sandwich, but it is convenient if you are staying in the signature mgm.  everything in the hotel closes at 5, other than the lounge, even starbucks!    i got a veggie panini here, and it was pretty good, altho it was $10.50 for a sandwich.  i guess it is vegas, so what did i expect."}
{"text":"3 stars due to high price.  Food was excellent but overpriced. I had the Garden breakfast.   Service was incredible. The busboy and the cashier were so kind."}
{"text":"The prices here are reasonable for an in-hotel restaurant.  The food is good, and the selection's fairly nice.  I'd definitely recommend stopping in if you're staying at the Signature.  I particularly like their Caesar salad."}
{"text":"This is a convenient place to get breakfast since it's located in the signature. But next time, I would rather get room service or go somewhere else. I got the classic egg scramble and it had way too much cheese in it. I normally don't have a problem with cheese but this was too much. The dish wasn't very appetizing. The only thing I liked were the potatoes that it came with and the sourdough bread."}
{"text":"I am a resident here at the signature so I frequently eat at delights and I am happy to say that it is always a delightful experience... as the service is excellent ;)!!"}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Signature three times and have only gone to Delights now. I guess you can blame it on staying at Tower 1 the first two times, and I haven't stepped foot in Starbucks there either.   I wasn't quite sure how things work around here but step up to the front counter and take a look at the chalk menu up above, order your food/drinks, pay, and sit down at an empty table. If you ordered for here, a waiter will bring out your food within 10-20 minutes since nothing is pre-made. I visited the the cafe twice and have eaten the chicken Caesar salad $10, fragrant cinnamon white chocolate French toast $12, and the delicious classic skillet scramble with ham & melted cheddar over breakfast potatoes with a side of fresh fruit and toasted rye bread (so good! Kinda glad they ran out of wheat). Portions are smaller than you expect but at least they'll be finished in one sitting.   They're open daily 7am-9pm, as indicated on the room key. The full menu is available the whole day. They also have snacks like chips, salsa jars, crackers, cookies, etc. There's a happy hour for mimosas on Sunday mornings and wine/beer in the afternoons. I really wanted to try the blush colored white Zinfandel but had to pass.   All bottled beverages in the fridge display are $4, as well as the strawberry granola yogurt parfait. They have freshly squeezed juice too.   *conveniently located in front of you after exiting the tower 2 elevators **also offers pizza, soup, pasta, plenty of sandwich options, and oatmeal/cereal in a bowl"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Signature and it was getting late so we stepped into Delights around 5 minutes before closing. We ordered a Four Cheese pizza, Pasta al Pomodoro, Cajun Chicken Alfredo pasta, a caesar salad, and a lemon bar to eat up in the room. We ordered and the food was done just a few minutes later.  The pizza, pasta pomodoro, and caesar were tasty. The cajun chicken alfredo was a bit blah and tasteless. The really need Emril it and kick it up a notch. The lemon bar was fantastic.   I really appreciated the convenience of the place - the restaurant was right there, they cooked it all lickety-split, and everything was wrapped up in a cool little to go bag. Nice."}
{"text":"Given the jacked up prices of most of the restaurants in Las Vegas, it is kind of nice to know there is a place with decently-priced, fresh meals available.  After frequenting the MGM Food Court more times than I would like, my sister suggested we go by the MGM Signature.  Yes, because this is place is located at the Signature, the cafe is a bit of a walk from most things in the MGM.  However, if you are looking for something healthy and fresh, Delights is the way to go.  One of the drawbacks was that their menu is not super extensive.  They carry your typical sandwiches, skillets, pasta, and juices.  Here are a few things that I tried:  Soup of the Day (Minestrone): Coming out piping hot and seasoned well, the minestrone for me was the perfect complement to my egg sandwich.  The minestrone had a slightly sweet flavor from the stewing of the vegetables.  I enjoyed the hearty sized pieces of the beans that makes a minestrone classic.  Plus, I appreciated the fact that the noodles came out al dente telling me that they weren't serving soup with pasta that had been sitting there for hours.  Melrose Avenue:  Not super flavorful but a good solid healthy choice.  Compared to most of the other options, the Melrose has perhaps the least interesting combinations but still I enjoyed the warm scrambled egg whites paired with the creamy sliced avocado and the diced tomatoes and cooked mushrooms.  In terms of flavor, it mainly came from the salty turkey bacon which also added a nice crisp for some crunch.   In terms of service, the staff was friendly but a little on the slow side.  I guess they are cooking the items to order so it does require some more time than your typical fast food fare.  Access to the Signature is limited from the MGM side so be careful about the hours.  Overall, I would recommend Delights especially if you are looking for a MUCH better alternative to the food court options at MGM."}
{"text":"It's a quite little place tucked away in tower 2 of the Signature at MGM.   I'm giving it 4 stars because it's better than waiting in line FOREVER at some of the other options, they have a nice beer and wine selection, the Caesar salads are delicious and the wait staff are very nice.   They could do with having another person on the register when they're busy but that's the only downside.   I ordered a large diet coke and the one that came was so tiny - like kids size - that I was all \"Argh, I'll need to get another one of those\" and she was lovely, got me another one and said \"We'll call that your refill\". That alone made me go back for 4 days to get lunch"}
{"text":"Avoid!  Bite the bullet and walk over to MGM where you can find food that is (a) not crazy expensive and (b) not totally disgusting.  I had the cheese pizza, and a diet Coke.  Grand total?  Around $18.  $4 for a tiny diet Coke, no refills.  The pizza would be big enough for two people...if those two people weren't hungry.  The pizza itself was disgusting.  It had WAY too much cheese.  And, I know, you're going to say \"impossible!  I love pizza with too much cheese.\"  No.  Seriously.  I scraped off a bunch of the cheese, and brought it back to the room, and even then people who swore there was no such thing as too much cheese were disgusted by this pizza.  The rest of the bachelorette party group wanted to go there later on, and I insisted we should not go there.  It is a totally gross rip-off (and this is even by everything-is-a-rip-off-in-Vegas standards)."}
{"text":"Overpriced establishment with unfriendly staff and extremely long wait times.  Stayed in the towers on my latest biz trip in town due to the smoke free, casino free environment. In the morning, I came down here to get breakfast at 8am, pretty early. There was a short line but it was moving so slowly that after 10min they only served 2 people in line. When I finally made it to the front of the line, my first 3 choices were out!? Really?!! I settled for the Melrose breakfast sandwich only to be told that it will take at least 10min. Wow! And it was a whooping $11.  Long story short, I had to eat my breakfast in the car due to the time I wasted, and I was still late to work. The food tasted ok, but the bread was slightly burnt. Definitely not coming back again!"}
{"text":"Just finished a meal from Delights. Ordered pepperoni pizza, farmer's market pizza, cajun chicken Alfredo, and michigan avenue sandwich. In a word, very disappointing. Pizza dough tasted like cardboard. Only ate one piece of each pizza ordered. Pasta was too creamy and bland. Only the sandwich was salvageable. All for the cost of nearly $50. Good thing we had food credit for this purchase. Otherwise, the rating would have been 1 star."}
{"text":"Stopped in because it was  more convenient than trudging over to Tower 1, the MGM's shopping concourse or out to the strip. That said, left empty-handed because there was just nothing on the menu that was of interest and they had no sundries (even a bag of Doritos would have made it not a waste of a pop-in)."}
{"text":"This place is yummy & convenient, so for me to give it anything less than a 4 star review would be crazy. The wait time can be long, but kill time talking amongst your friends about the previous nights and the wild times you all had ;).  *Get the cinammon white chocolate french toast, it's heavenly! *Fresh squeezed juice, beers on tap or in bottles *The French Quarter egg sandwich - andouille sausage included?! YUM! *Freshly made parfaits with the some of the best granola I've had *Chocolate or regular croissants *Standard coffee.  The prices are a bit steep, but it's Vegas and at a hotel so I expect that. Don't know if I'll be staying at the MGM signature again, but if I do... I'll know where to come get some yummy grub... thats literally just right down stairs."}
{"text":"I just ate one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The tower 3 breakfast sandwich. The bacon onion sourdough bread, the skirt steak, the goulda cheese, the caramelized onions.....mmmm.....it's a symphony of flavor. They don't skimp on portions.   I'm seriously shocked. They are really cooking here....not reheating stuff from a freezer."}
{"text":"This restaurant provides a quick delicious eats for those in the Signature tower 2 & 3. Especially if you are staying in tower 3 which has absolutely no eateries. The menu items are a little over priced. I did not find one signature delight menu item. Sorry signature please step it up. This restaurant does offer happy hour for guest in all of the 3 tower's."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was so awful. Maralena helped us and she was really rude. She wasn't friendly in the slightest and acted like ordering food was a huge inconvenience to her life. We won't be back because of the service."}
{"text":"My husband and I was walking around MGM and Signature looking for something besides Starbucks and we stumbled upon this place, The skillet breakfast with toast and fruit and a cup of coffee was just what we needed and very filling."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were staying at the MGM Signature this past weekend and being that we weren't RIGHT on the strip or inside a BIG hotel, we were happy to find this cafe inside our hotel.  We were in desperate need of something quick before heading to dayclub.    Now, keep in mind, everything in Vegas is overpriced.  Pretty much everything on the menu was around $14....egg scrambles, sandwiches, and salads.  Nothing really stood out to me and seemed to be worthy of the steep price except one thing; I ordered their steak and egg sandwich which was comprised of fried egg, caramelized onions, skirt steak with Gouda cheese all between an artisan baked bread.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this sandwich was.  It also came with a side of breakfast potatoes that seemed to be baked.  Basically, a healthier version of breakfast potatoes which was a plus.  It helped even out the heaviness of the sandwich.    Plenty of seats inside and they bring out the food to you when it's ready.  It took forever to order because of the big group in front of us and there only seemed to be one cashier while the other employee was busy bringing out food to tables."}
{"text":"Eggs were over cooked but pancakes were ok. Lots of good places to eat in Vegas so I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Staying at the MGM signature (tower 3). This was probably the closest eatery for a quick bite.  I had the Southwestern skillet scramble and the girlfriend had clam chowder.  The food wasn't anything special. Akin to, but a step-up from airline food. The service was good however. And the food came-out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"We stay twice a year in The Signature. But because we always stay at tower 1 we sometimes forget dat Delights is located in tower 2. Not neccessary.  It's an ok spot for a quick bite. Inside or for take out. They have a broad selection of breakfast and lunch. I know they also sell alcholic beverages and things like pizza. Don't know if they offer diner. But then again: who wants that in Vegas? The ambiance isn't that nice.  Last time we we're tired of the Starbucks and didn't fancy the pool menu. Tried it a day earlier and were very dissapointed. So Delights was the only options on walking distance. Ordered an orange juice, scrambled eggs and an espresso for take out. Not very special, but more than ok. Service is pretty quick, everything is nicely packed and all condiments are in the bag.  Note: I'm no native speaker. Forgive any spelling and grammar mistakes."}
{"text":"While vacationing in Vegas this past Memorial day weekend ended up doing a lot of drinking and bad eating so decided to eat something decent  for a change. This cozy/intimate spot is located in the MGM Signature tower 2 just behind the lobby area.  The inside is cozy but you also have the option to sit outside and eat just beware of the bird's. They are very ruthless and will descend on your food without regards. The place is deli style with the menu hanging from above the counter with breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner options. The prices are a bit steep but hey it's Vegas right? You gotta pay to play and food is no different.   I ordered the breakfast sampler which comes with eggs, choice of meat, choice of toasted bread and home fries. I received a number and you wait as your food is brought out to you. The wait wasn't long maybe a good five to ten minutes. I was able to food snoop at other people's plates to see what they had and every plate looked and smelled fantastic! I couldn't wait for my food.  I received my plate of poached eggs (over easy), wheat toast, chicken sausage and home fries. The portions looked good but could have been more for the price. In a bowl there where at least three poached eggs, two chicken sausages, 2 slices of toast and probably a scoop of potatoes. The meal was actually excellent and besides my eyes being bigger than my stomach I was quite satisfied not really full but content. I guess that's ok to not gain the dreaded \"vacation weight\". Only complaint I truly had was my eggs had two things going on. I asked for over easy poached eggs which they were cooked hard and at the base of the bowl was this liquid. It wasn't till from the eggs because they were hard it looked like unused yolk from another batch of eggs. So I fished out and drained the eggs off and put em on my plate. The potatoes were hands down the best! Special salute for having tabasco sauce available because on those eggs and potatoes they went up 10 notches. Also I didn't have hot sauce in my bag swagg lol.  This is a cool spot if your looking for a quick decent bite to eat while staying at the signature and don't feel like traveling. Good for family, date, relaxing, friends. The price is expensive so look to pay at least $15 for a meal. The food is worth it! If I'm back in Vegas staying at the Signature I have a place close to my vacay home I can grab a decent bite to eat."}
{"text":"The salads are amazing! I had the quinoa salad (my favorite), caprese salad, and the potato salad all of which were awesome. Another day I had the vegetable Panini which was tasty as well. It's good to have so many options, esp for the vegetarian crowd. I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie panini. A forth of the sandwich was nothing but bread. I have had this sandwich before but this time it just wasn't very good. I like delights and have been here many times before. If this was my first time I wouldn't go back. I will give it another try since I know this is not the norm. Disappointed today."}
{"text":"This place is simple and conveniently located if you are staying at the Signature. We had some credits to use up and this was the best place. It is a little pricey otherwise.  They are more of a breakfast and sandwich place. I had the scramble and it was a) tasty and b) generous. I would return here if I had credits again. It's clean and when we went it wasn't too busy so we were served quickly."}
{"text":"My friend found out about a sandwich that wasn't on their menu call \"Las Vegas Blvd\" it was GREAT! Strip steak, grilled onions, gouda cheese a special sauce with a fried egg on a onion and bacon sourdough bread...need I say more!? We also got the Bianco Pizza, bacon, caramelized onions, smoked gouda & provolone cheese with garlic cream sauce topped with balsamic mixed greens. That's also a big hit!"}
{"text":"If you're a local, or even a tourist staying on the strip, I wouldn't say you should go out of your way to visit Delights. But if you happen to be at the MGM Signature... well, this is pretty much your only choice. Luckily, it's pretty good! I had their vegetarian egg white scramble in a cast iron skillet and I was pleasantly surprised by how many fresh veggies were on it, and a huge portion of delicious avocado. It was by far the healthiest thing I ate the whole time I was in Vegas. It came with a side of pretty fresh fruit salad and toast. If you order without toast, they'll give you two servings of fruit.   They also have things you can pick up and go, like bottles of wine and snacks. Be warned: the prices are pretty outrageous. I think a small bottle of San Pelligrino was 4 or 5 bucks. The SMALL one! But this is Vegas, and what do you expect? If you want a bargain go to Costco beforehand and hoard it in your room!"}
{"text":"Very tasty options, a little pricey but par for a nice hotel. Quick service and very polite staff. I got the Huevos Racheros and it was very good. Smaller portions but good flavor."}
{"text":"Food came quickly and was hot.  Mine (the scramble) tasted good.  My husband's eggs were disgusting.  Little more than 30 minutes later neither of us felt very good.  A few hours later we felt okay, so it wasn't food poisoning but we likely won't return."}
{"text":"I am only giving them 2stars because of my first visit. Me and my husband loved our food we had the American breakfast and the salmon bagel. And truly enjoyed it.  However today we were heatedly disappointed. My husband ordered a traditional scramble with no cheese to go and I ordered the garden scramble to go.  When we arrived to our room we were highly disappointed. My husbands food had cheese. And my garden scramble was a joke.  When I think of a GARDEN ANYTHING I expect fresh produce. Other wise it's just a veggie scramble. Obviously my scramble was a mixture of canned mushrooms, canned tomatoes, onions and eggs whites. What a freaking joke. If I would of known that's what my plate was going to be I wouldn't have even bothered. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my meals at Delights! As a matter of fact, I ate both breakfast and dinner here and absolutely loved it! The staff was very friendly and there were no long lines!  Here's what I ordered and now recommend: *Fresh squeezed juice ($4) *The French Quarter egg sandwich served with fresh fruit ($12) *Cajun Chicken Pasta ($12) *Custom Pizza with two toppings ($16)  Although the prices are a bit steep, the portions are fair, and the food is delicious! I'm definitely willing to try new items on their menu. I highly recommend Delights for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and I'm so looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Only ate here because we had food/beverage credit from our stay at the Signature hotel. My burger was under seasoned and cold.  You could tell it was a frozen patty. The potatoes in the salad were under cooked.  If I would have paid, I would have been angry."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! It was on the first floor of our tower and we were regulars during our stay. The breakfast sandwiches were the perfect pick me up after our long night out. It is a great bang for your buck too which is hard to find in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stayed in tower two at the signature and this was right downstairs.  Had some comp to use at the MGM and came down for breakfast.  I like that they have \"healthier\" options.  Ordered the garden scramble with comes with egg whites, tomatoes, avocado, toast and potatoes.  It was huge.  Also ordered a side of chicken sausage.  A bit pricey.  Save the receipt if you want refills for coffee.  You cannot call in orders if you want to pick up your order.  Came on a Sunday morning at sound 9am and it wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"While staying at the Signature came down every day for breakfast. Great walnut cake and nice small plate breakfast menu."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and nasty. The menu is so boring and the food is gross. Do whatever you can not to go here."}
{"text":"We tried this place while we were waiting for our room to be ready for check in. What an utter disappointment. I got the short stack pancakes and first of all they were burnt. How does a cook see that most of the pancake is black and still send it out? Well, they just flip them over so you don't immediately know they're burnt but man, you'll quickly taste it. I sent them back and the server seemed so putout by it. The new order was barely better, both in the burnt aspect and taste. Both stacks tasted so strongly on bad oil, like the griddle hadn't been cleaned in a while. I choked down exactly half of one pancake because I was starving but couldn't manage anymore. It wasn't pleasant to pay close to 12.00 to have a server act like I pulled him out of bed and demanded that he personally remake my burnt and oily pancakes. If you have terrible cooks AND service staff you're failing."}
{"text":"One thing you should order, if you're not concerned about calorie or ripped enough to take your shirt off at the pool, order the cinnamon roll. Relatively inexpensive compared to restaurants within the hotel and the only breakfast place at the Signature.   Alcohol and scrambled eggs don't mix so I got the oat meal. Decent. I don't think that anyone can screw up an oat meal. I ordered pizza one night and it's huge - good for two to three people. It ended up in my room for five days.   But the winner really is the cinnamon roll. It swims in sweet sauce enough to make you diabetic."}
{"text":"This wonderful quick service cafe is perfect for a breakfast.  Order at the register and keep the receipt for coffee- free refills all day!   The food is beautifully cooked.  The simple menu is executed perfectly, so don't be fooled by the basic offerings-  they are done elegantly.   Excellent Greek parfait $5 -  the crunchy topping and fresh fruit is ripe and gorgeous.   The egg scramble is soft and non greasy, the ham grilled and tasty, the sourdough toast is lovely.    The cinnamon roll (heated) is not to be missed;  not overly sweet!  Amazing cream cheese frosting.  Yum yum.   And the staff (especially Lorca) are courteous, friendly and welcoming.  Great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Service was good. However the food was terrible. I would avoid this place if I were you. we ordered a breakfast wrap and a breakfast skillet. Both came with egg whites and it tasted bitter - I'm guessing it's not even real eggs. Also got a cappuccino and it was sub-par.  Overall a disappointing experience; quite a waste of calories and money."}
{"text":"I had the Southwestern skillet and orange juice and my BF had the cinnamon roll and coffee. The food was pretty good and I didn't have some of the other issues that others had.  HOWEVER, unfortunately, I am pretty sure I got food poisoning here.  I know some people are skeptical of food poisoning reviews because of the long incubation period but here's how I know! I got in on Wednesday and everything that I ate since Wednesday morning until Thursday night, I shared with my BF. The only thing that he didn't have a bite or a drink of was the orange juice! And I found out that raw juices are one of the common sources of food poisoning.  It sucks because everything I had was actually delicious here. It's just unfortunate that their hygiene practices aren't more up to par."}
{"text":"Came here three times to eat. The staff was good and prompt each time. They were able to accommodate my allergies and the custom food I ate. The one star missing was because of the uncomfortable chairs. I know it's and easy-go restaurant, but it's in a 5 star hotel. Get some padding on those chairs ."}
{"text":"Swung into this small little spot as we walked back into our hotel. We were craving something sweet! And thank goodness they were still open. :)  Got ourselves one lemon tart and one apple crumble tart. They were \"Vegas-priced\", but we didn't mind.  Broke into these babies back at our hotel suite. Both were amazeballs! But I liked the fresh tartness of the lemon tart way more than the apple one.   They serve breakfast and lunch items here and it seemed like some of the folks that were dining there were definitely enjoying their meals.  Great spot to grab something quick if you're staying at The Signature."}
{"text":"It's Vegas- I already expected to spend $15 on a sandwich, so the price wasn't an issue. Yeah, it's expensive, but again... Vegas. I actually went out of my way to come back to the deli because my panini was really good the first time. This time, I split one sandwich with my husband and it was pretty filling. (The first time I tried to eat one by myself and failed halfway through). I don't know- it's a pretty simple sandwich (pesto, roasted tomatoes, squash, and mozarella cheese), but very very delicious."}
{"text":"When overnighting in the signature towers at the MGM Grand, your dining selections are limited, however, with Delights, your eating experience is not compromised.   Conveniently located in tower #2, they offer coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, breakfast sandwiches and a nice selection of pastries for your morning meal experience.  Their menu runs fairly deep and has many more options then competitor Starbucks in tower #1.   So if you're looking for a simple, convenient and healthy way to start your day, try breakfast at Delights.   Salute!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I came for breakfasts and lunch. For breakfast I ordered the classic and the garden scramble. The two tastes about the same to me. They let you swap out regular eggs for egg whites in the classic, so maybe that's why they tasted the same. :) For lunch, I got the 3 salads plus a side of salmon. For the 3 salads, I got corn and bean, roasted beets, and the 3 bean quinoa. I loved them all. My only only only complaint about the salads is that they add oil. Maybe there's a reason for it but I could do without it. I think oil tames a lot of the natural flavors. My ultimate favorite is the beets because they added celery which makes it taste and feel like a potato salad but without potatoes. I loved the flavors. Again, minus the oil.   All in all, a bit pricey but good food. And that's not the reason for the 4 star instead of 5. It's really the oil part."}
{"text":"I am so glad this deli was in our tower, or else my husband and I would have missed out on YUMMY eats!  We had breakfast here and it was one of the best breakfasts we've ever had.  A little pricey for the amount of food you get, but the quality of food is SO good, it's worth it!  Their hash browns are awesome!  The presentation of the plate is pretty too.  We wanted something sweet after breakfast, so we got red velvet cupcakes (I'm so glad I found cupcakes at 7AM!)  Hands down, one of the BEST red velvet cupcakes I've ever had, and trust me, I have had many since I love cupcakes so much.  I loved it so much, I bought another one before they closed at 5pm later in the day, so I can it for dessert late night :)  If me and my husband stayed for more than two days, I would have eaten at least one of these cupcakes every day.    Next time we come here, we will try different breakfast dishes and definitely lunch."}
{"text":"Sadly, we frequented this place twice during our trip due to convenience. This cafe is located on the first floor of the hotel in the lobby of Tower 2 of The Signature at MGM.   I had the flu and the bf picked up soup for me. They had daily soup specials and the soup of the day was minestrone.  For $5, it was ok... It was the only substantive meal I had the entire stay, unfortunately.   Again, this was out of convenience otherwise we would have had to walk a distance to MGM or drive somewhere for food."}
{"text":"If your staying at The Signature Tower 2 this restaurant is very convenient for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Excellent choice of very tasty food at very reasonable prices. The staff are great too."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas Blvd sandwich fried egg seared skirt steak smoked gouda carmelized onion mesquite mayo onion and artisan baked bread was LITERALLY the best sandwich I ever had. Grabbed it right before we got into the car to leave home to LA and I was in HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!! SOOOOO GOOD! The bread has BACON baked into it. BACON!"}
{"text":"I got the Market BLT and my wife got the tuna sandwich. Both were super good! From the bread to the bacon to the coleslaw all of it was fantastic! Only reason I gave 4 stars was the pricing."}
{"text":"Garden scramble is delicious & so is the pancakes but it's on the pricey side. Small OJ cost almost $6."}
{"text":"The place is ok... Einstein Bro has better food if you ask me. The bad: took 20 min to get three sandwiches. Nobody was here besides two tables that were already sat."}
{"text":"This place is really a hidden gem of the restaurants in Las Vegas. The only reason I even knew about this place was because I won a free reward on MyVegas, so I went with my friends. It is tucked away behind the MGM Grand in the Signature. It's a pretty small, bistro type setup with a variety of gourmet breakfast foods and a small lunch menu. Me and my friends went here twice for breakfast and it was excellent. I got the Las Vegas Boulevard, which is basically a steak, egg and cheese sandwich, but it was simply divine, and certainly the best breakfast I had in Vegas, and one of my favorite breakfasts of all time. It came with a little bowl of fruit, and everything tasted really fresh and really clean and comfortable. The severs were excellent, and I really felt like I was at a place for only a select people to eat at. I highly recommend trying this place, and you'll be hooked. The only real con to this place is it is a bit far away from everything else, but well worth the travel."}
{"text":"I needed a fresh squeeze OJ after a long night in Vegas. I called at MGM and they transferred to me that place. The guy confirmed over the phone it's fresh squeezed. Once I got there I found out it's just bottled juice that the poured in cup. Never coming back"}
{"text":"I came here a few times during my stay at The Signature as I had some credits to eat here. I really enjoyed eating here. The selection is pretty good, healthy and isn't stringent if you need to substitute things. The servers are very helpful and friendly. One of the guys even offered me samples to try so I can make sure whatever I order will be something I like! I enjoyed the steak and egg sandwich, cheeseburger, caprese salad, kale salad and surprisingly my favorite salad was the beet salad!"}
{"text":"Prior to embarking upon our liquor filled bachelorette shenanigans, I needed to fuel up on some grub ASAP. Located in Tower 2 of The Signature, this place was a hop, skip, and jump away from the elevators that lead up to our room. As I entered, I noticed their broad range of food selection available. From pasta to sandwiches, and even breakfast, Delights has something for everyone.  Since it was around lunch time, I opted for a sandwich. The Bourbon Street sandwich definitely caught my eye. The sandwich was composed of blackened chicken breast, havarti cheese, lettuce, tomato, cajun mayo on caramelized onion and bacon bread. The meal came with delicious red potato salad and a huge dill pickle. Overall, this sandwich was epically delicious and definitely got me prepared for a day's worth of drinking."}
{"text":"Two stars because the prices aren't too high, but the quality of food is pretty low. I got the Garden Scramble and a coffee. The potatoes in the scramble tasted like old leftover French fries, the toast was dried out and not even as good as toasting your own generic grocery brand bread, the fruit was lower quality than the stuff they serve on airlines, and the coffee tasted like water. The price of the scramble was $12, but comes with the fruit and toast so I can live with it, but the water coffee was $4.50. I should have just gone to Starbucks next door :( Can't recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Very convenient when staying at the Signature, especially when you do not want to take the journey to any of the eateries the hotel has to offer. Fairly priced for Vegas standards and the overall quality was there. Stopped for a brunch and felt satisfied with the veggie omelet, white chocolate French toast and tuna melt sandwich."}
{"text":"Delights is a cute bright nook in the Signature where I headed for breakfast one morning. They have reliable service and great coffee. For food, I tried the Lemon + Raspberry baked pancakes. The concept was great, but it lacked a little in execution. They serve it with traditional maple syrup, which is a little strange. I think a raspberry syrup or a dollup of lemon curd on top would add some bold flavor and moisture it is currently lacking. The fresh raspberries on top were great...and actually the best part of the dish.   The guests I was with had the Melrose Avenue wrap, which has egg whites, avocado, tomatoes, mushrooms and turkey bacon in a wheat wrap, and they loved it so much they went back for another the next day! I don't think Delights is a place you go out of your way to visit when in Vegas, but if you're staying at the Signature, it's fast, convenient and full of decent grub."}
