{"text":"Stopped in with my wife. Just didn't want to commit to a big sit down meal, but couldn't stomach fast food. Stopped here on a whim and man are we glad we did. The freshest Mediterranean food we have found. Easy to order the staff was very friendly.  We had soup, hummus,  and a, sandwich. It was so good I'm not even going to try and explain.  I guarantee we go here once a week.  Very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Went to Ziggy's last night, and had a great time with friends.  The staff (especially Rachelle) were exceptional.  The food was good, and our server went above and beyond! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, craft beers, hearty portions of Great Lakes and other micro-brews, top shelf liquor, nicely renovated, easy going crowd, beautifully designed and decorated party room, family friendly, new HDTVs everywhere."}
{"text":"What I love about Ziggys is how they constantly try to make sure they keep the clientele happy. From the renovations to the food, they always try to improve. Something about this place just screams it's a REAL peoples hangout. Amherst is not a town that most people in the country have ever heard about but make no mistake there are good people here and you can find them at Ziggys. My first experience here years back was to some racist crap towards a person I was entering the place with but the rest of the people were quick to show us that wasn't the mentality of everyone here. People make up a large percentage of why you want to visit a place and I did like the crowd here overall. The new renovations look great and they still have great wings and beer for a good price. If you ever get the chance to pass by this town, Ziggys is worth stopping by. And don't forget to tip that great staff."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Little breezy by the door. Good choice of beers, but need a list. Been here with a big and small group. Overall, very satisfied."}
{"text":"Have come here a lot over the last 5 years.  The service has really gone down hill, and there portion size on side dishes (especially the fresh cut fries) are dismal compared to the past."}
{"text":"Ziggys is the best bar in Amherst.  There are a few others, and while they are fun, none can beat the atmosphere or the food of Ziggys.  My favorite thing to order is the white pizza!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning, and the breakfast was delicious. Had the breakfast questadilla, and also tried the eggs benedict. So good and filling. The service was slow, but friendly. I think she had too many tables. The prices were also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. This is a small town and is limited on a selection of nice places to eat. The food was really good. The server did make some great recommendations on food and needs to try. The service of food to the table and water refills was a little slow. The atmosphere and decor is fun and nice. Great place to watch the big game with all the tv's. The restaurant, bar,  and restrooms were very clean. I would recommend this establishment and will be on my list to come back to when back in the area."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday and I'm glad I did! $5 Burgers and $5 Butterfly Shrimp!  I wish my boyfriend and I would have stuck with both of those items. My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich that tasted like someone comes a piece if rubber and tried to mask it by melting cheese over it and adding bacon. The waitress was wonderful and apologized and brought out a new meal without attitude. That was the major downfall of the evening.   My one complaint is that they have a huge draft selection with no printed lists. The waitress looked a bit annoyed that I couldn't make a decision because I didn't know all the options.  The latter side of things...  The shrimp was great. The batter was perfect, not oily and not too much breading. The burger was just as great. Perfectly cooked at medium (which I ordered) and for some restaurants this is hard to achieve. The $5 burger is a burger that includes your choice of cheese, tomato, lettuce and onion. I also added a side of chip dip to go with my cups which embedded up being the perfect complement.   I will give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Great food, service, atmosphere, and lots of TV's..variety of seating options as well. I do recommend a printed beer list for better turnover on kegs as they have a good selection of beers on tap, but you wouldn't know unless sitting by them. Also using the doors by the stairs for entry would cut down on the arctic  blast to the patrons in the main bar area.  This is second time here.We are not from this area but find ourselves here often for kids athletic  events. All in all good reasonably priced food and friendly service.This will be our before/after game place."}
{"text":"Lots of tvs and nice decor. However, if you aren't a local and a regular they treat you like crap. Bar manager is very rude to staff and customers. You can often hear the servers talking crap about there customers, as I am experiencing first hand while writing this.   Food comes out hot but if you ask for it a special way it comes out wrong most of the time. Regardless food is good and good portions. Don't sit by the door if it is hot or cold out because there is no breezeway and you will freeze/sweat to death. Beer came out fine and drinks are made well. If the staff was nicer the experience would be much better but with not much choice of late night food in Amherst you're forced to settle."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at this restaurant until recently. After the past three awful services we will only return when friends force us! The food is great but the service had gone down hill recently! Sad actually"}
{"text":"TL;DR - come for a decent beer selection and an overpriced appetizer, stay for nothing else.  Pleased with the beer selection, got a hoppy beer and it was fresh. Kinda took awhile for them to come but no complaints here.  Started off with the southwest rolls. They were quite good however 3 small ones for roughly $9 was pretty over priced. Polish burger was good overall, however, I asked for medium and got a hockey puck. They didn't get either of the sides correct for my girlfriend or my dishes and we still got charged for them.  The place looks nice inside and definitely not a dive. The third waitress we had was nice and the first two were clearly annoyed with life before we even got there.  Place is meh, Obama stopped in once."}
{"text":"Love Ziggy's, great place to hang out and enjoy time with friends! Food is always good and have a great selections of beers and drinks and after all that is most important!"}
{"text":"Great place, good food! Big burgers and buttery pierogies. It was a great experience"}
{"text":"Slow service.....but when the food finally came it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"A local place with great food and drinks.  However the service is so incredibly bad, we probably won't be back.  This is not a kitchen issue - it is a service issue.  After your order is taken, you receive your food in a normal amount of time, now getting the staff to take your order is an entirely different thing."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of pierogi I was in love with the homemade ones that came from the kitchen. Go at least once a month to Hamtramck for good Polish Food and these were actually better.   We also tried a few different sauces for the wings and across the board they were really good (garlic Parmesan being the least favorite, but still good).  Only downside was they were out BBQ sauce, teriyaki and chocolate ice cream (for the shakes). Since we went late on a Sunday, maybe just bad timing?  Waitress was very personable and overall great experience."}
{"text":"A local favorite, they have great food and good weekly deals if you know when and what they are.  The staff are pretty on point, and they check in on us frequently even when they're busy. (I almost never have an empty drink).   They have done a lot of work on the place over the years, and it looks great for it. Can get pretty noisy if you decide to go at night, if you prefer a (less noisy) or more family friendly setting, go during their lunch hours."}
{"text":"Ziggy's has some amazing wings in many different varieties. We tried their Buffalo parmigiana cheese and boneless spicy. We also tried their potato tots with chili and the kitchen sing. And the appetizer that blew my mind was the fried sour kraut balls which were absolutely delicious. Ziggy's is a fantastic bar restaurant"}
{"text":"Your wings are very small and not worth the money. I bought 5 boneless wings and a couple were barely bigger than a quarter. PLEASE FIX"}
{"text":"We used Ziggy's to cater an after game meal for the Oberlin Women's Lacrosse team. We ordered three different wraps - turkey, italian and veggie, a tossed salad and fruit plate. Everything was fresh, well-presented and delicious. I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Great place! Huge menu selections and great atmosphere! Will defiantly make a trip back to sample more of the menu items!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Our server was Janene. It took 20 minutes(not so bad) to sit since the upstairs was closed. Was told a table was ours for another waitress to tell another group they could have it. Once we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us. 20 minutes to get our drinks. By the time she got back with our drinks we were ready to order and made it clear when she asked. She walked away. Took 40 minutes for 2 appetizers. Another 30 for our meals. Forgot one of my children's meals. Our drinks were constantly empty since we were waiting so long. They were filled maybe 3 times in little over 2 hours. Every time she would pick a plate up or bring refills she was walking away before we could tell her we needed something. Finally it was time for the checks. It took another 20 minutes just to get cashed out."}
{"text":"I'm taking g away a star because on several occasions I tried to rsvp a table but was told they will not RSVP because of big games (OSU/Clv browns) but when I arrive half the bar tables are Rsvp'd. I guess it pays to know the owner or manager."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped there today, great little place. Good service and lots of choices. Beer batter fries were a little unique but good. Lots of tvs, would be a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"The food here has always been pretty good. It's a little cramped but whatever. Not a big deal. The service can be shitty sometimes even on dead days. I came in one night with a group of friends and the server was kind of bitchy. I'm not sure if it was because she though we were drunk (that point hadn't even happened yet) or because she was just bitchy."}
{"text":"Nice bar with some good wings. Tater tots were good, they were just warm and not hot. We had 5 flavors of wings and they were all good. Guinness was perfect. The deep fried mushrooms were great as was the sauerkraut balls. We will go back."}
{"text":"Came back for the wings since everyone mentioned them and they were admittedly very good. The garlic parmesan sauce was pretty oily but had a strong savory flavor while the Ziggy sauce was a sweeter version of your standard wing sauce based on Frank's Red Hot Sauce. I enjoyed the rustic and non-manufactured taste of the sauces but what really stepped them up to the next level were the actual wings and drumsticks which were maybe 30% meatier than b-dub wings and were consistently moist. I would highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Food here used to be very good. Last 3-4 times I've gone my tables orders have been messed up and my good was sub par. Lately it has been disappointing more often than not"}
{"text":"Well 4 years later and they have gotten too big.  The kitchen can't keep up.  The ziggy sauce is all over the place.  And they have dirty taps."}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast you could get full all day for $6 I can't believe how reasonably well priced it is. I love all the lunch and dinner menu also and they have a great selection and the specials are great. My sister had her rehearsal dinner there in the hall and they did an awesome job I am looking forward to booking my parents 40th anniversary party there . The only thing I HATE! No hostess urgh I hate searching for a seat then when there are no seats available there  is No where to stand or take a number for the next table that opens soooo annoying so usually when that happens we just leave and go to stubby's"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It's our Go-To on the way back from Cedar Point. We're from Pittsburgh and Ziggy's is open late and only about thirty minutes from the park.   Great burgers, great wings, big, easy parking.  Love it!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We have ben there on really busy and slow nights. The food is always fast and tastes great! Our friends who live an hour away always request we bring out \"Ziggy's Pizza\" when we come out."}
{"text":"Great food and a fun atmosphere!  Gets really busy so plan accordingly!  We enjoy the take out bi-weekly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great, I mean great food and awesome service. Nice beer menu with great prices. They also have amazing specials. Tons of tv'a to watch games. Love this place."}
{"text":"One of my more favorite bars to go to either for late night drinks or to go watch a sporting event. I don't get out here much anymore, but I used to come here all the time to watch Ohio State games. The food is usually good and the employees pretty good. Never had a bad experience at Ziggy's."}
{"text":"First visit after living here for almost 2 years and I can only say \"What was I waiting for?\"   Pub and restaurant is a good description, as the bar area is big, with loads of TV screens and there is another area for those that don't want the noise of the bar.   The menu is extensive, but we came on Wednesday for the $5 burger.  Service was as good as it gets.   Quick drink order, quick food order, refills and check.  Couldn't ask for anything more.  We both had the cheeseburger, with mine being medium well as I don't like pink.   It was cooked to perfection.   The burger is huge, and my only complaint might be is that the bun is very thick.   I think it might need to be though since the burger itself is so large.   I had the fries which were nice and hot and my husband had the chips which were especially good when they were hot.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"What can I say, Ziggy's is the place to be! They have awesome food and a great selection of beers. Every time I go there it is packed. The perfect place to watch a game since they have so many flat screens through out. I just had dinner there last night and you would have thought it was a Friday night but it was Wednesday! Every seat in the house was full. On Wednesday's they offer a $5 burger special.  I loved the buffalo chicken sandwich! It was so SO good! The opening of Brew Kettle down the street has definitely not affected business for Ziggy's. The service is really great and our waitress was checking on us frequently. One of my favorite bars in Amherst to hang out at. Obama sure did put them on the map!"}
{"text":"Ziggys holds a special place in my heart, this was the first bar I bought my first drink \"vodka 7\" (I was in 7th grade) I've matured now & moved up to vodka sodas like a legal drinker..breakfast is pretty good as well as service.  The building actually use to be kuss's pharmacy over a hundred years ago owned & operated by my great great grandparents.  My great grandmother once told me a scientist from Polaroid film walked in looking to sell stock...but mother said no dear we are not throwing money away, she saw the future 2008!   Obama was here, 2nd president to visit Ohio..JFK was the first he drove by my uncle Walt who was patching a roof on his bar \"Adams Cafe\" In Lorain Ohio.  Can't wait for Hillary to visit the brass pole in Elyria   Ohio heartbeat of America"}
{"text":"Good bar food, nicely renovated. OBAMA stops here!"}
{"text":"Amherst, city of bars. If you are looking for the best one in town then stop by and give Ziggy's a try.  One of the best things about Ziggy's is it's size. I hate going to bars where I am forced to touch arms with that big, obnoxious meathead who has had a few too many.  This bar has a great mixture of barstools, high-top tables (round and square) and regular tables. Even when Ziggy's is busy I never feel like I am crammed into a sardine can. They also have plenty of flatscreen TVs if you want a place to watch that big game.  If you want some great bar food then come hungry. Not only do they have tasty appetizers, they have great pizza, wraps, salads and dinner specials. I love the Ziggy Wrap! I also love their homemade chips with dip. If you like Lake Erie Perch you have to give theirs a try! I have yet to have a bad meal at Ziggy's. I often order take out and it is just as good at home as it is in the bar!  The service is always friendly at Ziggy's! For the most part their servers and bartenders are very sweet. Even on busy nights they do their best to serve their customers in a timely fashion.   Icing on the cake??? They have free Wi-Fi. If you want to take in your computer and do some work or hold a meeting they are very accommodating."}
{"text":"Having heard a lot of great things about Ziggy's, my wife and I were looking forward to finally dining there. Parking is at a premium in the small downtown area of Amherst, so we were fortunate to find a spot in the lot behind the restaurant that was not reserved bank customers.   The restaurant is much larger than it appears from the front. The bar is large and there are at least a couple dozen high top and regular tables. I understand that there is a second floor that can also be used for dining.   Our server was prompt and friendly. In fact, service was excellent throughout the meal and after. The menu is typical pub food. There are meal specials every night, which appear to be of great value. We had the hamburger special ($6 for a cheeseburger). The burger was huge and the bun fresh. It was cooked to the exact temperature ordered. The meal included a selection of fries (two types), tots, or chips (which were great). I had a cup of stuffed cabbage soup, which was served hot and was very good.  There are TVs throughout the restaurant and it is pretty noisy.   If you have not tried Ziggy's I would recommend that you do so."}
{"text":"The prices were great for the portions. Service was quick and out waitress was friendly. The appetizers were freshly battered and tasted delicious. Two thumbs up. I recommend if you're in Amherst, Ohio you should come eat at Ziggy's."}
{"text":"Walked into this lively spot on a hot Ohio night. Friendly waitress greeted us. The menu is plentiful.  I chose the Gyro wrap, and the highlight was the cucumber sauce. My companion had a Hogg Burger with beer batter fries.  Both were a big hit. This is a place we would enjoy again."}
{"text":"Very nice bar with great bar food. Lots of tv's in this place if you're going to watch the game. The staff was friendly and welcoming and kept our glasses full.   The menu was very extensive with many options. It made it a little difficult to decide what to order. I decided to go with the Stuffed Banana Peppers as an appetizer and the Italian Stallion Grinder as my sandwich with tater tots. The tots were perfect with a little crunch and just enough flavor without being too salty. The Italian stallion grinder was very good as well. When it comes to the Hot Stuffed Banana Peppers, they were amazing!!!! I absolutely hate when I go out and order something on a menu and they claim it's spicy and they just don't deliver. These DELIVER! Full of flavors, spicy and a perfect amount of cheese and sausage. The peppers themselves were cooked perfectly too. Loved these peppers. In fact they are the best stuffed hot peppers I've ever had to date. You have to try them.   I also tried the chips and dip that somebody else ordered and they were also very good. That dip is delicious!   I will go back and I recommend it to anybody who is just looking to have a few drinks and great bar food to choose from."}
{"text":"Have never had anything bad to eat here. Since they renovated, this is a completely different bar and atmosphere. The weekend nights are still packed with drinkers, but you can still grab a table usually. The pizza is to die for here and the wings are a 9/10. Better beer specials and atmosphere than Church Street. Bonus: Browns Backers Bar... packed with Browns fans on SUndays and Buckeye fans on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Food was really good, service not so much.  Try the buffalo chicken dip - it's creamy,  not too spicy, and served with fried pita chips. Yum.  The burgers and wings are good too.  Our server seemed to have a hard time refilling drinks and had attitude when we asked for condiments. We were ready to stay to keep drinking, but she brought our checks without asking.  We left to drink up the road instead."}
{"text":"An Amherst favorite with overpriced, decent bar food. Nothing to write home about. Friday and Saturday nights the place fills up with rowdy youth, wanna be gang bangers. This bar is over priced, overhyped. and grossly overrated."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and it was fantastic! The blt fold over is to die for! A small had 8 slices and was enough for two people and leftovers. My daughter was given crayons and a kid menu and was easily entertained  coloring away while we waited on our meal. I couldn't believe how busy they were for lunch! And our table was cleared, menus put out drinks immediately. Refills were prompt and service was great!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had our rehearsal dinner here and needed to use the elevator for him and our elderly guests.  The elevator ended up breaking down and he and our guest were unable to get upstairs to the party room.  The owners and most of the staff did as much as they could to get it up and working with no avail.  They were more than accommodating and moved us all down to the first floor and took very good care of us.  Kiddos to Ziggy's and staff for making a not so good situation, better.  Oh, and the food is ALWAYS fantastic!!! My guests who had never been there, raved about it!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Ordered an appetizer and a kids meal and I've been waiting for almost 40 mins. In fact, I STILL don't have the food and received a \"passing by\" apology from the waitress, who I had to flag down because she avoided eye contact for so long."}
{"text":"A little above average bar food.  Place is nearly always packed and typically difficult to get good service at the bar.  Maybe one more bartender would help this problem out.  I have been here more than once and will go back as it is close to home."}
{"text":"I've gone in this bar a few times on Friday nights...I notice there's a table in the back full of drunk old men that keep drinking until they're drunk...they hit on everything in sight, GROSS and the food is mediocre at best, and NOT worth putting up with drunk old men...Yuk"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in Ziggy's. I went here with my Dad because he really wanted ribs. And from what I can tell those ribs were the best part of the meal, and they are the only thing that keeps me from rating this place one star.   The lady who was our waitress was terrible. Fake smile, annoyed facial gestures at any request (like asking for more tartar sauce), and even though all our glasses were empty she stood and flirted with another waiter in the corner of the room for five or so minutes. Hair twirls, raised leg and all.   I ordered the lake Erie perch and it was under-cooked in the center. Since it was so large though I ate around that, but it was so bland I needed way more tartar sauce that I would normally use. Additionally, by the time the dish got to me the french fries were already starting to go cold and floppy--yum.   Frankly if my Dad hadn't been having such a dang good time I would have sent everything back and probably just left. But I don't ruin other people's dining experiences when I can help it. If he had hated it too we definitely would have walked out.   Awful."}
{"text":"Once again, roadtrip eastbound through Ohio, relying on Yelp to feed us. Not disappointed!Ziggy's is a great find! The food is delicious and generously portioned, the wait staff is friendly and helpful - Rebecca was awesome - and it's clean and welcoming. I cannot say enough about how good the food was, especially the homemade chips and dip (they didn't even come with my meal, but I stole them from my son's plate once I tried one!) I enjoyed the pulled pork quesadillas with just enough spicy kick, and such a large portion that I'll be having them again later. My oldest son ordered the \"hog and heifer\" sandwich that was almost as big as his head! But he found room to enjoy it all. Rebecca assured me that the owner/chef makes everything in house; they have a smoker upstairs to make their pulled pork, brisket and ribs. You can definitely taste the quality in their food, and the love that goes into it. Great place to pull you off of I-80 for a good meal. Adding to my bookmarks for our next roadtrip :)"}
{"text":"This place hits what it's aiming for. Has a great selection of typical Bar food along with a few items you wouldn't expect. You'll be able to find something you like on this menu.  Great food - I went with boneless wings covered in Ziggy sauce - the sauce was great.  Good service - friendly, attentive, but not over the top.  Great atmosphere - plenty of TVs, clean."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Our server was exceptional and food delicious. Will definitely return. Has the vibe of a upscale college pub and lots of fun things on the menu. The boneless buffalo ranch chicken wings are top notch"}
