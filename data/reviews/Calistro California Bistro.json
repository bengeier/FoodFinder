{"text":"This restaurant is a real gem. The food is so fresh and flavorful.  The menu is creative, service is great....I could go on and on.  I've been here several times and everything is consistent.  Looks like they have a nice Happy Hour, too."}
{"text":"Food is just so-so. Way too over-priced.  Ambiance was \"stuffy\" and uncomfortable.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place based on the food hype, but...alas...I was underwhelmed. Inside decor is pleasant with soothing contemporary colors and woods. If you sit at a window table your view is that of the parking lot,  so this restaurant should be about the food, music, and inward-directed ambiance.  The music I can't remember. The food was good, but not special. First courses are expensive and ordinary. Fish dishes are nicely done. I did not need the waiter harping on the fact the food is all organic, etc. I expected that.  A few interesting wines by the glass. Beware that soft drinks like lemonade and iced tea come in glasses with a hundred ice cubes and refills are an extra $. That's a rip-off, especially when you are out with your AA friends or your under-aged kids!  They said they'd take off the charge for the refills, but my point was: don't nickel and dime customers with such charges. Maybe in a few months the raison d'etre of this nice place will gel.  I hope it will develop a friendly, easy to love menu, a gastronomic (?) level just above The Herb Box (only a mile away)--so us locals can swing by more often for meals."}
{"text":"Our experience at Calistro started out a little shaky, when the server first informed us that the fish of the day was sold out (at 8pm on a slow Tuesday night) and then, after we asked how the Alaskan scallop entree was prepared, informed us that the chef couldn't get the scallops from Alaska that day and had instead gotten them from Japan (not a big deal, but still, it seems like they have some issues with supply). However, the rest of the experience was totally delightful.

The hummus starter was great - what really makes the dish is their flatbread, cooked in their wood oven with some oil and garlic. The summer roll starter was equally great, a mix of very strong flavors that almost overpowered the tuna a little too much, but it was so tasty I didn't care.

The salmon entree was everything you can ask from this kind of California cuisine. The fish was incredibly fresh, perfectly cooked, and lightly seasoned, sitting on a bed of vegetables and a delicious lemon sauce. I also had a side of the wood roasted seasonal vegetables, which would compliment any entree nicely.

When it comes to dessert, I often like to pick the most unique dish, one I've never or rarely seen elsewhere, and Calistro's dairy-free rice pudding certainly fit that bill. It was the ideal refreshing dessert to end a nice meal with.

I really like what they have going here, with a \"farm-to-table\" approach that focuses on the ingredients and bringing out the best in them. It's no Chez Panisse, but it's nice to see some Valley restaurants heading more in that direction. Prices are reasonable (no entrees over $30;  sides and desserts around $5-6), service is terrific, and the subtle decor keeps the focus on the food. They're located in a new, half-empty DC Ranch strip center that many people probably don't even know exists. In addition, the space is huge and their rent probably matches. Given those factors, I wouldn't be surprised if they're not around long, but that would be a shame. Hopefully, Valley diners will seek Calistro out to give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Calistro Bistro recently then you haven't been to Calistro's. The weekly pris fixe 3 course menu for $20 until 5:30 is unbelievable. World class cocktails in the lounge until 7:00 for $5. My husband and I went twice in one week. The food, staff, and restaurant ambience including original art make for a memorable experience worth repeating. If we lived within walking distance this would be our favorite neighborhood eatery."}
{"text":"Great location! Walking distance from the hotel. Great service and most especially GREAT FOOD. Coming from NYC, it was a place to eat away from home! Take advantage of their early sitting. Friendly, cozy. I'll be back.

{"text":"Very average food, especially for what they charge. There were very few tables yet the service was very slow. My cocktail took 20 minutes to get to us but at least it was tasty.  My wife ordered a drink made with OJ and the waitress came back 15 minutes later to announce they didn't have any!  Wierd.  We had the crab cakes and the goat cheese for apps; tasted like it came out of the Safeway freezer section.  For the main course, I had the Pasta Bolognese which was OK, not much flavor but not unpleasant.  My wife had the duck; again OK but not nearly worth the price. It came with a large slice of bread that was mostly burned.  The service was friendly but not nearly professional enough when you charge $22 and up for main courses.  We skipped dessert; just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner at the Calistro Bistro last night.  After reading the reviews posted to date, everyone had great things to say so I thought I'd take a chance.

When I pulled up, I couldn't tell is the place was even open.  The windows were all closed up and with no window in the door; you can't see in to tell if someone is in there.  Turns out they had the sun shades down but from the outside, it makes the place look like it' not open for business.

The décor is average.  Nothing noteworthy either way so enough said.  Their web site talks about their large patio - there is one on the side of the restaurant that didn't appear to be ready for use and the one in front - it's not large and you can almost touch the grills on the cars parked next to your table.

I had studied the menu ahead of time and narrowed down my selections.  Much to my surprise, the menu I was given was different that that posted on the web; both in selection and price.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a restaurant changing things now and then but this place has been open for less than 30 days.  I find it strange that in that short time period, not only has the menu changed but the prices changed and significantly on certain dishes.

We each had a house salad.  The portion was as expected for this type of restaurant.  If like you variety in your salad, don't order this.  It was a small pile of field greens, 4 slivers of carrots and of slivers of a mystery veggie.

I also ordered a plate of their flatbread.  It was completely void of taste.  Very thin bread that was supposedly seasoned with herbs and olive oil.  I challenge you to find any olive oil in or on this bread.
I had the crab cake appetizer as my entrée and my friend had the fish special of the day, herb-crusted butterfish.  Average at best.  I prefer lumps of crab meat in my crab cakes and the crab in these had been mashed to death.  The butterfish was just OK; Roy's does a much better butterfish.

Throw in a Coke and an iced tea and our total was $65.  Definitely not worth it in my opinion.

Update - I had some stomach issues after dinner; my friends had much biggers issues - Don't eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a true gem.  The food is always fresh and LOCAL.  The service is top-notch.  I usually sit at the bar and watch a game, and the bartender Brian is great to chat with about the game, or recommend a wine to go with my meal.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"In all fairness, I'm reviewing our experience for New Year's Eve pre-fixe meal...

I brought a party of 8 out tonight to enjoy a new experience.  Thankfully, the company was great.

To start, the service was good, but not exceptional.  

The menu selections were fair, but not overly exciting.  

However, what we did eat was quite tasty.  But there was so little of it on our plates I had to laugh.  For $50, I got about 12 spoonfuls of soup, 2 vegaterian raviolis, and 1 of 2 desserts they had left off the menu.  

Since they didn't have the one we wanted, we asked for a little ice cream with the choice left.  Not a big request, since there was a table of 8, but the server came out stating the chef wanted to charge us for the extra ice cream.  

We were shocked to say the least...

What gall they had to ask for us to pay for a scoop of ice cream after the puny servings we were given for $50.  

To their credit, they didn't charge us for the ice cream after we refused... but I'd have to say we were given, not surprisingly, about a teaspoon of ice cream.

Again, while I didn't expect an all you can eat buffet... this place wasn't advertised as haute cuisine.  As such, I expected at least enough food to not leave hungry.  

Bottom line...

Very good food, nice presentation... but the servings were literally a joke.  

Too bad, because I would love to go back and sample their normal menu.. but I have a feeling I'd leave hungry again.

I don't understand how a chef could be so full of himself that he believes his creations and presentation will overcome failing to serve his guests enough food.  When I've seen this in the past, the chef is usually delusional... they think they can get by on just a \"cool\" factor or their \"talent.\"  

Well, as they say... you're only as good as your last meal.

Remember, if you're creating a dining experience, its not just about entertainment, it's about feeding people.  And buddy, I left hungry tonight..."}
{"text":"We visited the location at Hilton Village.  service was OK, food was borderline terrible.  we shared a couple apps, the falafel bites and pumpkin squash were bland and rubbery.  the tacos were embarrassingly bad.  the tortillas were identical to Mission flour tortilla's you'd find at a supermarket.  interestingly, this place boasts a \"farm to table\" approach, but we felt like everything was prepackaged and re-thermalized Sysco feed.  i dont see this location lasting very long, too many top quality places like Houston's are a stone throw away."}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful oasis of great service and very good, fresh tasting, creative and inspired food. I stumbled on it when I couldn't get in to a place across the street that was jammed. Calistro should be packed too. It was a lovely find."}
{"text":"Devin, Owner of Calistro California Bistro, 

If you're still cooking away, why don't you take note of the troubling feedback from the other disappointed patrons?  I love how you only respond to one reviewer and lucky for me, I just so happen to get the pleasure of hearing your disrespectful and abusive attitude. Wow, some people and places never change..."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Calistro opened up right by my house and I am so happy about it! The veggie terrine dish is amazing, and the sweet potato mash is to die for. I've also had the steak, which was phenominal. They have high quality tea, of which I love the cranberry hibiscus flavor. Their drink menu also features hand crafted cocktails and an impressive wine list amongst other non-alcoholic drink options. 

The decor is clean and polished, with friendly staff and management. The space itself is very large, and so even if it is a busy night at Calistro, you never feel stuffy. Patio seating is available, and since the patio is enclosed they are able to control for climate. Im so pleased to have Calistro in my neighborhood, I hope they stick around for a while!"}
{"text":"I liked the decor, but the place was fairly empty on a Friday evening so it lacked vibrancy.

The service was friendly but a little on the slow side.

There were 7 of us in our group.  I thought the food was mediocre.  I had the Vegetarian Plate and I have had a lot better.  The tomato sauce tasted canned.  A fresh tomato salsa would have added a sparkle to the otherwise boring dish.  My guests enjoyed the shrimp.

The prices seemed high for what we got."}
{"text":"Very nice place, the food is Unique and Ok, the only problem there is no selections on the beer, they are all draft to the taste of the owner according to the staff. hope stay open!!!!!!  Nice happy hour , the menu is just ok."}
{"text":"Calistro is definitley a local treasure. I tried Calistro for the first time about a month ago, and then tried it again with a group of girlfriends last night. Both experiences were exceptional. The head chef, Gerald has a great eye for tasteful food combinations without being overdone or overpriced.

My first experience the two of us tried the Ahi Tuna starter with a great smoky flavor, the crab cakes, made with hummus instead of bread crumbs, and the house chips with a blue cheese dip. All exceptionally delicious. We were so full, but HAD to try dessert, so we got 3 flavors of ice cream that they get from Sweet Republic with unique flavors like salted caramel and peanut butter chip.

Last night I brought 4 newbies to Calistro to try some other menu items. The generous helping of hummus lasted all 5 of us and then some. Then we all ordered a glass of wine ($7 for ALL glasses from 3-6pm, what a great deal!). Gerald then went of the menu and created us a watermelon and goat cheese feta salad which was fresh and crisp. Lastly, I talked everyone into some more ice cream, this time going for the maple bacon ice cream. Delicious. It was so sweet and crispy, and who doesn't like bacon or ice cream, let alone together?!

All in all the ambience of the bar, separated with a wine display into the dining room, also includes an enclosed outdoor patio where they have live music some night is spectacular. It's a great place to have a quiet date night, or host a large group of friends. The staff is very knowledgable and friendly, I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight for dinner. On Tuesday's they have 3 dollar tacos. My wife had the tacos and dug 'em. That's a lot to say as we are pretty critical of our tacos. 

I took advantage of the $30 anniversary deal: ceprese salad, filet, chocolate  souffle. The steak was good, came on some potatoes and vegetable and topped with a bearnaise sauce. 

Overall, not too bad. We may eat there again, but it's kind of a drive and probably not good enough to pull us across town again."}
{"text":"The food was great and service was fast.  Greeted very promptly and happily as soon as I walked in.  Jerry, the managing partner, and my waitress, Kerri, were awesome.  I always seek out locally owned places while traveling and this place is a gem. Highly recommend making this a stop while in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. 

The salmon is a must try.  Kudos to Chef Brandon."}
{"text":"Great food! Cool bar. Menu did not highlight the homemade pasta that was great. Steak was also really nice. Service was attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time, went for lunch on a weekday.  I tried the duck wraps and colleagues had the fish of the day, which was salmon.  The wraps were good, but a little on the small side, seemed more like an appetizer.  I would try another item next time.  The server was friendly knowledgeable and provided a complimentary appetizer for us to try - very nice, that doesn't happen often around here!  The appetizer was fantastic - sweet potato tots.  Overall it was a great lunch and we will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We were in North Scottsdale taking photographs of the desert, and ended up close to the Calistro Bistro.  So after all the glowing reviews, we decided to stop in for Happy Hour on a Sunday and give it a try.  Wow, were we impressed.  We were the only ones in the place (except for a bridal shower in the back room), and were asked where we would like to sit.  Being chilled from being outside in the rain, we opted to sit at the seating area where you could view the chef's working, and directly in front of the cooking fire.  

We were offered drinks, and since my designated driver doesn't drink, was given a choice of a number of teas.  The one she selected was fabulous (according to her).  I saw that they had Anchor Steam Porter on tap, and I was in heaven,  

They have a wide choice of  appetizers on their happy hour menu, and we tried several of them - the pork taco, the fish taco, the flatbread, and the short-rib Panini sliders.  All were delicious.  They were all so appetizing, we couldn't pick a favorite between the fish (salmon) taco, the pork taco, and the flatbread.  The meat in the sliders was fantastic, but the toasted panini  was slightly over browned.

I might add that the waitress originally brought us an order of hummus that someone else ordered, and it looked so good, that I thought my wife was going to arm wrestle her  for  it.  She said that the next time we were there, that was going to be one of her choices.

I do not give many places 5 stars, but I will on Calistro.  There were so many pluses - allowing us to sit where we wanted (I was impressed that the even allowed us in the way we were dressed), Anchor Steam Porter on tap, delicious food, interesting flavors, lovely décor, and wonderful servers.  All in all, a delightful experience on a cold, windy, rainy day."}
{"text":"Just finished having a group dinner at Calistro. As a group of 17 we were delighted with our food and experience.  Salads were delicious and generous.  My personal favorite was the Greek salad.  The vegetarian dish that was served was lovely to look at  and constructed of eggplant, peppers, spinach on a bed of orzo nestled next to fresh marinara.  

The food came out in a timely manner and Jerry and the staff were courteous and quick.

The restaurant's ambience was very nice.  A great time in the midst of a dust storm!"}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews, we decided to give Calistro a try with friends. We all agreed, it was just average food and we would not be compelled to return. 

The server was nice and professional, but she highly recommended the appetizer and mains and they were simply average is taste. Nothing to write home about. Nothing mind blowing. Nothing that said, wow, this is delicious. 

The atmosphere was good and our friends liked the wine, but the food needs to be improved upon. Hate to see them go if they are locally owned, but not sure how they will survive if they don't  improve their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour deals! The girls at my work and I love their flat bread pizza and vegetables with hummus! :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant has a city view and a romantic ambience. Staff is friendly and attentive. However, the dinner menu is just decent at best as pricey as it was. I just can't really throw out anything worth noting about the dinner considering the price of $100+ for two."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch. Upon arrival, the atmosphere seemed to be nice enough.  We weren't sure how to dress for the restaurant, because there were no hints on the website, so we stuck with business casual and we were fine.

Our appetizer, the bruschetta, was delicious, and so was the fresh-squeezed lemonade, though I felt the lemonade was quite overpriced for a single glass, no refills at $4.

My husband ordered an entree and I ordered a panini.  Neither one of us really liked the food.  The dishes were within the spectrum of food that we usually enjoy.  My Caprese Panini was overpowered with the lettuce that was on it.  My husband's pork wasn't anything special.   The presentation was wonderful, and the service was adequate, but we will definitely not make the 80-mile round trip again."}
{"text":"Doesn't seem like they get many customers.  I attended with a group on girls on a random Thursday.  The location of calistro is in a strip mall neat Lincoln dr and Scottsdale rd.

We were in time for happy hour and I asked which of the red wines ($7 a glass for hh) were sweeter.  The waiter did not know how to respond.  He finally did recommend one, which turns out they only had 1 glass left which one if the other girls got so he recommended another red wine.  Two minutes later he comes back saying they are out of that one too!! At this point in saying \"just give me red\"!

When our food came our, the waiter couldn't remember who had what... Rookie mistake!

I had the pasta bolognese which was ok, the bread they serve with it is lightly grilled which was yummy.

The manager gave our group free dessert because of the wine mishap which was nice.  We tried the chocolate pastry, rice pudding and apple crisp.  All were just ok.

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I live right up the street and eagerly awaited the opening of Calistro last year.  Blech.  Been there three times, three times too many.  Food is not good, ridiculously overpriced, service is confused.  I really wanted to love Calistro, but I don't."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after a hike, b/c we were in the neighborhood.  I love this type of food.  The pumpkin dumplings needed a little more texture and they had beets on them which I love, wish I  would have know that from the menu description so I wouldn't have ordered the beet salad.  Duck confit flatbread was delish.  However, when the bill arrived I was pretty BEAT again.  $27 with tax and tip but a friend and I split the app, salad, and meal.  My part was $27.  I was not wowed for the price of the stuff.   Overall, I just thought there would be a lot of places I would prefer to go before this one again."}
{"text":"This place has class! What a gem, I'm glad I found it. Jerry was incredibly welcoming. All the artwork inside is original and done by his son. The drink menu caught my eye as it has all my favorite cocktails; sazerac, manhattan and old fashions. I could easily see this place making my weekly rotation. Well done Jerry!"}
{"text":"We used our first ever Groupon here.  It offered a three course meal, up to $100 food for two, for $49  + +.

Our conclusion is that it was good value, but really only worth $49.  Had we paid the full menu price for want we got, it would have been ABV  - appallingly bad value.

The major flaw in the meal was that the appetizer three cheese/ flatbread plate Was served with ice cold cheese.  Any brain dead idiot knows that chilling cheese virtually eliminates its flavor; the flavor blooms at room temperature, the  temperature at which cheese is made.  We couldn't believe it.  Our two salads (house and Greek) were adequate but very small.  The entrees were quite good - pasta bolognese and pappardelle with duck confit - although the duck leg was a bit overlooked.  The wines, a chardonnay and Pinot noir, included in the deal and on the regular menu at $8 each, are excellent."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening, I ordered takeout from here.  The Sandwich was great (modified club sandwich), the salad was okay, and the service was excellent.  After being at the pool all day, I was exhausted and not in the mood to cook, so I went exploring the neighborhood in search of some good takeout.  The sandwich was around $12 dollars and came with a side salad- not cheap and also not expensive.  I had a good glass of wine while I waited and Dennis, the guy who assisted me, was helpful and charming.  I also met some wonderful patrons who had great things to say about Calistro; I will be back soon to actually dine-in at this quaint restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is lovely and the staff and managers VERY passionate about delivering a fabulous experience.  LOVE the salmon. WOW.  Prices are so fair!  I would highly recommend this place on food, service, atmosphere-- all were delicious."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Calistro and I just can't give it a better rating.  If I were rating the ambience, it would be 5 star!  Loved the simple elegant contemporary feeling that they have created.  The menu and the food were not simple at all.  If the restaurant is to survive, they need to simplify the menu and the spices.  Someone had the roasted chicken...We were going to split it, but the seasoning was so strange, I didn't want it.  My husband had the crab cakes that had hummus in them...o.k. not great.  I had the salmon and it was the least complex yet it was good and simple.  I didn't think anything came to just basics...they all had an edge that I would have preferred not having.  I love food, we eat out regularly, but this was a little over the top and I didn't think it worked so well...In fairness, the staff was good, presentation was lovely, it was the seasoning and sauces that were off."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and some pre-meeting computing prep.  Nice atmosphere, attentive wait staff.  The menu was very readable and prices seemed reasonable.  I had a Mediterranean salad and the meatballs.  The salad was just right and the meatballs were delicious.  I could drink that sauce with a straw, then guessing and confirming it had a nice red wine component, that wouldn't be appropriate.  Complements to Kelsey, Joel and Jerry on making my brief stay there a very pleasant and rewarding one.  Did I mention that they have very good free WiFi?  I'll definitely be back and will bring some others with me.  Skip the big chain restaurant next door and dine here."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Wonderful glass of organic bubbly.  The ginger carrot soup was amazing-made with a cauliflower base.  Crab cake appetizers were light with a lot of crab.  Fillet mignon was good, although not sure covering in cheese was good idea.  Artic char was nicely done, but the citrus on the veg and crab hash was overwhelming.  Cheesecake was very rich, but a little odd without a crust-on the other hand, the raspberry sauce was so fresh.  Cappuccino was good, but extremely expensive $6!  

This place is overpriced with a bit of an identity crisis.  It isn't sure if it is a semi-casual bar restaurant or a \"fancy\" special night place.  I'd go there for appetizers and a glass of wine if only it weren't so, so far away."}
{"text":"Stuck up personnel and carefully measured miniature portions. Overpriced meals swimming in grease. Can't say this was even mediocre quality food. The crab cakes consisted mostly of bread crumbs and the bolognese sauce tastes better at home. Will definitely not recommend, there are lots of better, friendlier places in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Calistro's for our anniversary a couple of weeks ago. We heard it was a paleo-friendly place to eat so we definitely wanted to check it out. We are pretty picky with our food which can be embarrassing sometimes we don't eat out a lot. 

The place wasn't super busy but there were a number of tables full when we arrived. They came to the table right away and the server was very informative in helping me choose my meal. It was a new menu (put in place a week prior he said) yet he was very knowledgable about each dish. I chose the Lamb meatloaf and my husband had the pork chops. 

Both of us really enjoyed our food. It wasn't boring but the flavors compliments each other very well. The server was attentive, the atmosphere great, and the manager came over as well. He talked to us for a little while and wasn't just friendly but seemed genuinely sincere with making sure we had a good experience.

We've told our friends about Calistro's since and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a cute unassuming restaurant for Scottsdale! 
I was immediately impressed by the friendliness of the staff and owner! You don't often see a restaurant owner helping his wait staff with refills, expediting etc, but here you will. 
At first glance the menu may seem small but that allows each item to be perfected and as good as the next. Pet peeve 2376 is when a menu has 4 or 5 pages of food but they only make one or two good things. What is the point?!
Our table ordered 2 lamb meatloaf sandwiches and the duck wraps. The meatloaf was delicious and moist and had a rich cream sauce/gravy layered on top. It was wonderful and I would definitely get it again.  
I can't rate the duck wraps as a whole, but I did sneak a piece of the duck meat from my friends plate and it had me wanting more. I guess there is always next time...

Keep up the good work Calistro, I am impressed!"}
{"text":"Wow! Deeeeelicious food that is obviously made with love.

Amazing happy hour prices.

And, have the bartender  make you one of his fancy-ass cocktails. Amazing."}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice place for sure. Modern decor. You can go in formally dressed or relaxed because, hey, it's a \"Bistro\". The food ingredients are locally grown organics, a lot like Cafepino at the 101 mall.

Don't let the 3 star rating fool you though...

The flat bread appetizer is incredible coming from a stone cook oven. It easily feeds two as a meal and for a party of four it will definitely take the edge off so a long pause between main course is welcome.

The chef is a seafood chef and has explored the red meat side of things to give the menu a broader selection and of the 4 of us they hit a 50/50 shot with the main courses.

Here's why only 3 stars...

I had a fantastic short rib meal nicely seasoned, meat came apart like a roast cooked to perfection and placed on mashed potatoes in a delectable dark sauce it was magnificent! 

My wife's Filet at 30 bones had the potential to be something along a fine steak house since my meal was so fantastic, but they cooked the outside it looked like on a pan and left the interior too rare and all it did was make the meat tough and under cooked. Maestros still has any steakhouse beat head to head so they have a high standard to measure up to.

Out friends had the Chicken Sausage and noodles, a major thumbs down and the other the Alaskan scallops which were brilliantly prepared and presented.

It appears from a guests point of view that they should stay with what they know. I think I got lucky with my dish because they can prepare the meat and cook it properly. A steak however has to me made on the spot and that takes a steak expert to get it right. This chef is not a steak expert, he's a seafood cook.

My advice, stay with the flat bread for an appetizer and try the fish :-)

All The Best!

{"text":"We checked this place out last night for the early bird special and we were the only ones there.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the view of Camelback Mountain while the sun was setting.  The service was pretty good and the food was decent.  We were able to enjoy happy hour drinks on the patio...bonus - $3 draft beer and $5 cosmopolitan!  We took advantage of the $20 3-course dinner - greek salad, pork loin with sweet potatoes and peanut butter chip ice cream for me and caesar salad, chicken and vanilla goat's milk gelato for the hubby.  Overall, pretty good, but the food is better at other nearby places.  Note: if you check-in on Yelp, you will also save 15% off your bill!

I hope this place makes it, but they need to advertise more and step up the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"First, I want to tell you I love the Calistro California Bistro at DC Ranch, so we thought we would give the new location a try.  I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was with the experience.  Our service was slow with the exception that someone did come by three times to ask us if anyone had been to our table to take care of us.

When someone finally did come, they provided us with two menus.  Both of them were different and had different prices printed on them.  Mine had the Greek Salad for $6.00 and my wife's had a price of $9.00.  They did give us matching menus, so we ordered.

I ordered the Greek Salad and it was the worse salad I have ever had.  Feta cheese was almost invisible and all you could taste was olives.  The pulled chicken was stringy, at best.

I understand the place is new, but they really need to get it together if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"First off, the place is beautiful and has a great looking bar. The rest, was one big meh. Our server was disinterested and the food we had just looked flat out lazy. My wife had the Caprese salad and it was awful. The cheese was certainly not fresh and the tomatoes (which were in season btw) were very tired. Ive had great Caprese numerous times so Im not just talkin out my arse. My dish was also sub par. I had the short ribs, which is one of my favorite dishes. The beef was cooked well, but the flavor was lacking and the rest of the dish including the vegetables looked terrible and the presentation of the dish just looked sloppy. Heres the deal, if your gonna charge $12 for caprese and $26 for short ribs, they better be damn good. These werent and the service was equally over priced. Its a shame cause the place looks great."}
{"text":"Calistro's
One of my favorite restaurants. Being local I am here often. Their happy hour rocks..Bar menu 50% off regular menu. 

Try the Lamb Meatloaf. Excellent.

Make sure you try The Sassy Stinger....a drink for 2."}
{"text":"I have to use one star?

I used to be a regular customer at Calistro California Bistro. We discovered this place one day because we wanted a new happy hour place. I love flatbreads and this place had (key word had) awesome flatbread.  Things have recently changed here and the flatbread is no longer made in house and it's not very good. It is plain and not nearly as flavorful as the previous version. 

The service used to be awesome but now it isn't.  Maybe they just didn't want me to be a regular customer anymore. Who knows?

One night I ordered a burger that was not prepared to my liking. Simple fix = make a new one. Instead they cooked the existing one more and over cooked it. Any chef knows this will happen. Laziness always prevails. 

The best part is the manager passively aggressively said \"My burger was prepared the right way\" (as if I was the problem).  So I passively aggressively posted this review. 
Then the manager offers to make another one. I have already waited about 45 minutes at this point - why not continue to wait? Clearly I have nothing better to do. So I reluctantly agreed because I actually liked coming there. So after another 30 minutes I am presented with a burger.  It was the way I asked for it to be, the FIRST two times.  But I'm still not happy and since I had waited so long I wasn't even hungry anymore.  I could have gone to another restaurant, ordered and eaten by this point. 

My question is who accommodates me for all of the time wasted waiting for food that should have been prepared the right way the first 2 times I asked? 
Calistro actually charged me for my burger, never once gave me a reason to come back, no apology for their gross inadequacies and laziness in the kitchen. Nothing.  Every other successful restaurant tries to make immediate amends while the customer is there. There should never be an instance where management should indicate to someone - that they are the problem, not the food preparation.   When that customer leaves and you do nothing this is what you end up with. Bad reviews. 
Take advice from the marketing gurus at Starbucks. You have a bad experience and the next drink is on them. Coupon in hand when you leave. No choice but to come back and how quickly do we forget the bad time.


The restaurant is in a tough location, they aren't very busy whenever I'm there. I would think they would want to keep regular customers (2-3 times a week) happy.  But I guess they really don't want me dining there anyway. I take service like this personally."}
{"text":"I continue to come back to this place over and over---  intimate atmosphere, high attention to ingredients (especially fresh, flavorful, and oh yes, locally grown organics). big YES"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant on a Saturday night. We found it by searching online for organic/vegan/local ingredients dining spots and decided to check it out. First impression on decor is good. Saturday evening they said they have live music. If it were not for the band the place would be getting 2 stars. They were awesome.
 
The waiter pretty much ruined the experience (BTW we were the only ppl in the dining room) he was rude. They offer a specialty style of dining, the wait staff needs to inform people on the menu. What wine goes good with the app we ordered, where do they order their \"local\" ahi, etc. When you approach our table to greet us and say \"what do you want to drink\" I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Closed clams have been dead for an unknown period of time and are unsafe to consume and that is what they gave us in one of the dinners. I didn't even complain about the missing eggplant in the eggplant caponata that should have been included with the sunfish dinner but I note EGGPLANT WAS MISSING. The sunfish dinner was cooked nice and had the taste of eggplant caponata without the eggplant. We ordered focaccia so we could get some bread and we got four two inch by two inch ( approximate ) thin pieces for four dollars that was tasty.

We did alert our server about the closed clam and someone came out and apologized and presented us with a dish of cooked clams. A closed clam can infect the whole dish and has the potential to make someone sick. 

If we didn't have the clam problem I would have given three stars because it was just OK.

I don't want to go to anyplace that would serve someone a dead clam on top of their dinner I will not be back and am thinking I should have given one star."}
{"text":"We had a very nice but not perfect lunch here. We both liked the unique menu with lots of not every day choices.

My waiter was very pleasant and nice but not well trained on the menu and got mixed up during the ordering process .

We asked our waiter about the pumpkin dumplings and he was so enthusiastic and said they were one of his favorites so we decided to give them a try. The dumplings soon came out and the plate was so pretty with braised red cabbage and fresh greens over the 3 dumplings . I tasted one and discovered it was extremely gummy, my husband tasted one and finished it also saying this was very gummy . We only had one and 1/2 dumplings left so I didn't feel I had enough to send back or make a complaint . The execution of this dish was off but the flavors worked well and maybe this dish is better most times. 

I liked the small lemony salads that came with the lunch plates.

My waiter noticed upon it's arrival by the manager that my lunch fish of the day came out as a different selection than what I was expecting and I declined the offer from the waiter and manager to make a new plate since it is a fish I eat and it was hot and fresh and together with my husbands meal . I received salmon that I think was prepared very good for farm raised and the high light was the roasted NOT EVERY DAY vegetables of root vegetables , peppers , variety squashes and potatoes , the vegetables were very nice .

My husband had the  baked chicken/prosciutto meatballs . He said they were hard and dry but did have good flavor .

We would come back again."}
{"text":"Nice little north Scottsdale restaurant. I wasn't really feeling the 'farm fresh' concept that seems to be the basis of the restaurant though. I was expecting a much younger feel but the decor and vibe was more 40+ Scottsdale socialite than 20+ urban organic hipster.

They have a reverse happy hour from 9:30 to close. We arrived at 9pm and it was pretty empty, adding more to the sterile vibe. Sat in the bar and ordered a couple of apps for the table to share and a bottle of wine, then ordered one of everything from the happy hour menu at 9:30 and another bottle. 

The best things about Calistro are the presentation and the service, both 5 stars. Outstanding on both counts. The food was really good and I think the sweet spot here is for the happy hour on the way home from a movie or something. A 7pm dinner would feel a little bland to me.

Dishes of note: Falafel, Flatbread, short rib sliders, lamb meatballs were all excellent. I wasn't a huge fan of the fish taco or the ravioli (it was really dry and flavorless to me, my companions loved them)

I don't know if I'd plan a dinner here, but I'd definitely go back for happy hour. If the weather was a bit warmer they had some great fires and couches on the outside patio overlooking the city. Other than to sit out there, I wouldn't come with a group of more than 4.

Cliffs
- meh atmosphere
- great service/presentation
- pretty good food
- meh value, good value during happy hour
- one of the best restaurants for sure in the Pima corridor location"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal at Calistro. I had the tilapia with goat cheese stuffed tomatoes and it was delicious. My server was knowledgeable of the menu and made great suggestions for a starter and entree. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was the tail end of the in-laws visit for the holidays, and after a trip up to Sedona, and a long day at work, the 4 of us had no interest in cooking dinner.  So out we went.  Chose Calistro due to a decent prior experience there, and from what sweetie and I could remember of the menu, there seemed to be something for everyone there.  And let me tell you, there could not be a more diverse group of eating tastes (the foodie- me... and I hate that term, the pescatarian, the meat and potatoes guy, and the nothing spicy lady).  Well, this place delivered.  I had the duck confit pasta and it was deliciously nuanced and so satisfying  I ate every bite.  The house salad and appetizer shrimp were excellent, so was the special fish taco, and on the burger, the BBQ sauce was amazingly flavored, and unique to boot!  We all enjoyed ourselves in the nice atmosphere, and I can definitely say I will be coming back for their happy hour and specials!  

p.s. 4 stars is as high as I go unless the place is truly one in a lifetime, so consider this a very strong review."}
{"text":"I went to Calistro for its opening weeked and I have to say everything was fresh and delicious. The staff was motivated and excited about not only the restaurants opening, but its concept. As we learned, the restaurant's owner has thought out each essential detail of the restaurant. He is also determined to make as many facets of Calistro locally influenced, all the way down to the pecan wood trimmings from a local Arizona retailer.

Now, to the food! Each food item is noticeably prepared with the freshest ingredients. Therefore, if you are used to eating foods with more processed ingredients, the food may seem to lack that belly busting punch. We ate appetizers, main course and desert. I left feeling satisfied, but not ill. I highly recommend the chicken, flatbread and creme brulee (butterscotch, not butterscotchy, but just a hint). Also, they offer their deserts for $5 and are a reasonable portion - I often thought restaurants should do cheaper and smaller deserts and patrons would be more likely to get that final course. 

They have a great Happy Hour menu, 7 days a week, which features $5 glasses of wine, a list of appetizers that are about 1/2 off, as well as other great deals. 

I can't wait to try their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"To those of you who have given this place a less than favorable review more than a month ago, you owe it to yourself to give it another try.  The new management has really stepped up the food, service, and the Happy Hour is as good as it gets, both eats and drinks.  I'd give it six stars if I could."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try if you're in the area.  Had the asian duck wraps and they were delicious.  The duck was tasty and moist and the accompanying vegetables and sauce were wonderful complements.  The other diners in my party had the salmon and both were very pleased with their meals as well.  This will be a restaurant we will be returning to in the near future to try the other menu items.  The cappuccino left much to be desired, but lacking a bit on the after lunch coffee wouldn't prompt me to remove a star from the amazing meal I had.  The decor is subtle and the layout is strange inside, and there is absolutely no decor outside but don't let the unassuming touches fool you.  The food is worth it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars 

Calistro has a great vibe.. that, coupled with the fact that there are Gluten-free and Paleo options ..keeps me coming back !

I love organic farm to table freshness and you get that here.
My first time eating here wasn't stellar, but,  i figured they needed some time to find their groove.( service issue)

low-lights;
Small menu /wine list ( yet solid for what they offer)

High-lights ;
Salads are very good ,I like the Jicama salad and the Beet salad .
The herb chicken is a great GF dinner choice as it is tasty ,prepared and presented well .
This establishment also donates to fight Autism ( certain wines) which also deserves mention."}
{"text":"we had a coupon for dinner here so we decided to leave our sanctuary and venture to north scottsdale for this dining experience. 

beautiful setting and the menu wasn't too overwhelming. the happy hour looked like a great deal, so maybe we'll head back for that. 

we only got shared plates because all the entree dishes were ridiculously overpriced. the fish of the day? cod. and 28 bucks for THAT? cod? thats just crazy....28 bucks for cod. if you want more people to eat organic and local, you gotta cut the cost. why on earth would a middle class family of four eat somewhere that serves organic and fresh but it costs a month salary when they can just go to freaking california pizza kitchen or cheese cake factory for half the price? 

anyway, so although we can luckily afford a few organic pleasures every now and then, i'll cook my own wild caught fish for a fraction of the cost. so all our shared plates were good...the tuna, the falafel, the ravioli, and the beet salad. but our server was so \"miss\". not that it was his fault, i don't know. he said it was the kitchen. in any case, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our first appetizer. they slowly came out on time after that. and then we indulged in the p-butter mousse and apple crisp and both were delectable. 

and as a show of gratitude, we were comp'd the dessert due to our long food wait! now that's good business in my book. so we'll probably go back and try the happy hour menu. don't get me wrong, the food is tasty and probably very healthy, just a wee on the pricey side for what you get."}
{"text":"I was conflicted on giving 2 or 3 stars here for a few reasons.  I'm a glass half-empty kind of gal, so I'll start with the negatives:

1) Service was dog crap.  Pure dog poop.  Our waitress was snotty and slow and not very helpful. 
2) Food was either REALLY good or REALLY bad depending on what you ordered.
3) Price was too pricey for what you got.
4) Drinks were meh.  


Positives:
1) The manager on duty was great and very helpful.
2) The duck confit flatbread was AMAZING.  I'm not sure I've enjoyed a flat bread dish like that...well, ever.  Flat bread is usually one of the last things I'd order.
3) The hummus is quite possibly the smoothest, most delicious hummus I've had around Phoenix.
4) AMAZINGLY good tacos - I had the fish, but tasted the pork and I'd order them again...very good food.


Overall summary: 
It's in DC Ranch, the environment is pretty nice.  I went with 2 other people (one person had a Groupon) and we all agreed it wasn't overly easy finding something on the menu we were dying to have.  I ordered the chicken schniztel (too lazy to Google how to spell that correctly) and a fish taco (b/c they were $3 that night) and the fish taco was amazing (even though I had to send it back originally b/c she gave me a salmon taco, not tilapia.  I love salmon, but not in a taco...step it up people).  One of the other people I went with ordered a shrimp pasta dish and he didn't like it...that's saying a lot b/c this person would eat anything and be happy with it.  

So - overall, unless you have a coupon or some huge reason to go there, I wouldn't waste my time.  I know they promote the \"farm to plate\" mentality, but whatever, I'm not really a bleeding heart like that so that means zero to me.  If you do go, order the Route 29 Martini (made with a Reisling wine) and the hummus for sure.  And good luck with the service."}
{"text":"I had grand expectations for Calistro Bistro! I love farm-to-table. I love the fresh, local food movement. Sadly, it just didn't measure up. 

A nod to our server, as service was excellent and the \"that spicy mango thingy\" drink (a Serrano pepper & mango infused tequila margarita) is unique and will please those of you who like cocktails with a bite. 

But, that's about as good as it got. \"Farm-to-table\" inspires visions of entrees with crisp, fresh, complex and discernible flavors. Our food reminded me of standard hotel fare. 

We started with the crab cake and while the crab was very good there was way too much filler. To the extent that I would get whole bites of filler, disappointing my palate with a mealy bready effect. 

Next, one of each of the street tacos. Both were terribly -- like disgustingly -- greasy. Beware: hold these puppies right over your plate because as you angle them for a bite, a river of taco-seasoning -infused oil will stream out the back. And, the chili-powder flavor didn't do it for me. 

Finally, the Arctic Char entree: the vegetables and the fish were each overcooked. Though, there was some potential as the cut of fish seemed quality and the veggie selection showed good choices. Besides being overcooked, there was no flavor. None. Nada. :( 

So, all of this disappointment and $95 later (not including tip), I think it's safe to say I won't be making the trek to Calistro Bistro again."}
{"text":"Although this place has been around for a while, I just made it in last week.  I like the sleek and contemporary decor a lot.  The modern artwork is very interesting.

I split a caesar salad and had the pasta bolognese.  I really liked the meatiness and flavor of bolognese.  My client raved about her crab cakes.

This is a nice place for a meal in the DC Ranch area."}
{"text":"My husband took me here last night to celebrate my birthday. We took advantage of the happy hour specials: 

Happy Hour
available in the lounge area only
7 days a week | 3 - 7 pm
$2 off | draft beer | all cocktails
$3 off | all wines by the glass
$4 off | starters | grill + flatbreads*
*Excludes Seasonal Organic Vegetables

My husband ordered the Angeline Pinot Noir for $5 per glass, and I had the Sonoma Vineyards Merlot at the same price. 

We had the Hummus (lemon, cumin, tahini, with tomato, sumac) with flatbread for $5 and the Falafel Bites (chickpea croquettes, with cucumber, pickled shallots, curry yogurt), which came with five for $4.

We also split an order of Seasonal Organic Vegetables (wood roasted seasonal local organic vegetables, preserved lemon vinaigrette) for $6.  
 
Everything was deliciously prepared. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere relaxing. And we were able to turn happy hour into an almost-vegan meal for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Not recommended. As a guy who has opened and ran many high profile restaurants in Scottsdale,  I can be honest. They have ONE pasta on the menu, tagliatelle, which they make in house. My wife ordered it with their Bolognese.  Who the hell puts CUMIN in a Bolognese sauce? It tasted more like chili! I ordered what sounded very good on the menu, open faced lamb meatloaf with gravy. Well, the waitress knew I am lactose intolerant because she is too...the meatloaf came out not drenched in gravy, but in a thick cream sauce. Can't eat it, sent it back. My wife asked for bread and out came what these guys call focaccia...well, it was far from it. And, they have the balls to charge $4 for basket of this dry nasty \"bread\". WTF? WHO EVEN CHARGES FOR BREAD? Manager was nice, but not good at reading people. I didnt want anuthing else but to get the hell out of there, I explained I was not inclined to the type of foods they chose to put on the menu, but he kept recommending dish after dish persistently. I finally looked at him, made the slashing motion across my neck while staring into his eyes and said firmly, \"I am done\". He finally got it."}
{"text":"I like it here!

After hearing how great this place was, I had to see for myself.  Happy Hour?  I'm in!  

Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the open and inviting decor - bamboo floors, high ceilings, a beautiful outdoor patio... what's not to like?  Oh, and ladies, the bar had purse hooks!

While Calistro serves \"healthy cuisine\", please do not translate that to mean \"cardboard-esque and tasteless\".  Each item we tried was delicious, full of richness and flavor.  I learned that 80% of the ingredients used are organic, and most are from local vendors.  They even have organic vodka.  Did you know that organic vodka existed?  I didn't.  

It was a very happy HH, indeed.

Flatbread - a wood-fired combination of tomatoes, pesto, basil and fresh mozzarella.  It was much larger than I expected, and the flatbread crust was perfect - even the cheese-less edges which I usually don't eat...

Wood Roasted Ravioli - from the Shared Plates section of the dinner menu.  I had never tried a \"baked\" ravioli and these, prepared in the wood-fired oven, were outstanding!  The filling was a sweet and savory combination that I really enjoyed.

Short Rib Panini Sliders - were it not for the bread (which was toasted just right), you would not need to chew.  The braised short ribs are that tender.  Beautiful!

Angeline Pinot Noir - a pleasant taste of California wine country (blend of Sonoma, Mendocino & Santa Barbara grapes).  I like Calistro's presentation - the wine is first poured into a small individual carafe and then a portion is poured into your glass - you pour the rest when you are ready.  Maybe it is for aeration, but visually this makes me think I am getting more than one glass - yum!

I did make my typical mistake of not leaving any room for dessert (when, oh when will I learn?).  The Chocolate Soufflé Cake the couple next to me had looked amazing.  Darn!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Calistro California Bistro late one Saturday night. Thank goodness it was open, all nearby restaurants were closing and we were starving.  It's tucked away in the center behind Houston's. 

I was pleasantly surprised!  The decor has a modern, clean vibe--stylish but not excessive.  The food is exceptionally fresh and I loved the staff--they were incredibly helpful and engaging and kept us in good company at the bar.

We scored such an incredible deal: Greek salad, Mediterranean flatbread (best flatbread I've ever had!), a generous bowl of hummus, and a beer for under 25 bucks. I'm eager to try some of the main entrées; the chicken looked awesome, as did some of the other salads. 

I'm definitely coming back!  It's a perfect place to take my mom and grandma when they come to town; they'll love the food and we can sit on the climate controlled patio without sweating our butts off when summer rolls around."}
{"text":"I found Calistro California Bistro on the Dine Green website. I thought I'd support a local business who was making a real effort to be \"green\" and to source local products. 

When I arrived I noticed the decor is very \"cool\" and modern. The place looked very clean and inviting from the second I walked in. I was a little early (meeting a friend) so I sat down and ordered a drink and appetizer. The hummus was amazing and the flat-bread they serve with it was to die for. Excellent choice and good sized for the price. 

Once my friend arrived we ordered. I ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich which was simply awesome. The mozzarella was some of the best I have had in my life - including from my honeymoon in Italy last year.

My friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich which he said was also very good. 

With my entrée I ordered a salad which was fresh and light. The dressing was very good as well. I was very pleased with the amount of food and although I spent a little more than I usually would I left very satisfied and very full. 

I don't usually comment on restrooms but I just have to say that I was pleased to find the mens room to be the best smelling of any I can remember ever using. A+ (It's the little things, isn't it?)

We chatted with the general manager for a few minutes about the Dine Green certification. I was pleased to hear he was very knowledgeable about the program and the steps that they have taken to be green. Even the tables, which were very cool, were sourced from recycled materials. I especially liked the bamboo flooring and the use of natural sunlight. The GM also informed us about the \"green\" dish washing machine they use! 

All in all it was an excellent lunch. Great food, great atmosphere, great staff and to top it all off they are green! I will definitely be entertaining clients at Calistro in the future and I hope to check them out for happy hour if I am in the area after hours."}
{"text":"While this place had been around for a while, we only made it in a few months ago before they closed. Honestly, I'm not surprised they closed. The location had very low traffic and the day we stopped in, there was no one else in the restaurant. 

Our waitress was nice and attentive. She also kept our water glasses full, which is great. For lunch, my husband ordered the soup of the day (something with rice and duck) while I ordered the House Burger. The burger came with a house BBQ sauce, which had a funny taste. Too much sugar maybe? It wasn't anything special.

We only ate lunch here once, kept thinking we should go back and give it another try, but now that decision has been made for us."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there first time, last night.  Crab cake appetizer- quite bready, no chunks of crab. Duck confit w/ pasta entree- very good.  Crispy skin, moist meat, good pasta sauce.  Roast pork- very ordinary, no special flavor to make you remember it. All in all a very average meal for a lot of money."}
{"text":"I'm letting the word out on one of Scottsdale's best kept secrets.  Calistro California Bistro is a quiet Scottsdale neighborhood restaurant that should be making a lot more noise on the valley's food scene.  Calistro offers an inviting ambiance, a friendly and hardworking staff, and most importantly delicious fare.

The menu is small but it is still difficult to decide.  Everything sounds good.  The food tastes fresh and prepared in-house from scratch.  I had the duck confit tagliatelle.  The duck leg was cooked perfectly and the meat easily fell off the bone.  It was so flavorful that I felt like it was challenging me to chew on the bone like a dog so I could taste more.  The hand-cut pasta was also magnificent and the madiera cream sauce is a perfect compliment.  The meal is also served with an amazing piece of focaccia.  Baked with some delectable herds, the bread would have been fine on its own, but once I dipped it in the madiera, I was in heaven.  My fiancé had the filet.  She asked for vegetables instead of the mashed potatoes which they had no issues accommodating.  I took a bite of the beef, which was cooked to a perfect medium

Like most of the best places in the valley, Calistro is an unassuming little space in a strip mall.  When you pull into the parking lot of the Hilton Village there is little that distinguishes the restaurant at first glance.  But don't let this put you off, once you walk onto the patio you will know you're in a great spot.  The bar is a perfect little spot to have a drink and keep an eye on a game or whatever else the TV is playing.  It's divided from the dining room by a beautiful wine rack.  Unique art lines the walls.

Calistro is not expensive, but good food is going to cost you good money.  However; there's a great $50 for $25 deal on local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) which will get you a great meal and make things easier on the wallet.

Give Calistro a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm very sad this restaurant has closed.  It was a nice little business with some great people behind it.  I think that the location was just hard to see and they were too far from the street."}
{"text":"Service was attentive and friendly. Five stars for smiling, happy-chick waiter.
The food however was shit. No wait, let me rephrase that.
The food was as if a huge pile 'o shit walked into their kitchen, took a shit on the floor and one of the kitchen staff came hurriedly rushing over, scooped it up and plopped it into five serving dishes, loudly announcing to the servers;

          \"ORDER-UP, TABLE TWELVE!\"

We were table twelve.

Corn and asparagus succotash was dry, with no semblance of anything asparagus, not even the flavor. it was orange. ORANGE for christ's sakes!

The creole soup was as if someone in the same kitchen where shit just took a dump, emptied a can of tomato paste into a bowl, threw in some uncooked okra and for effect, one little tiny bay shrimp. Curious.

A burger ordered medium arrived table side, drier than a nun's hoo-ha.

The house salad dressing so odiferous, it reminded me of my armoire after my dirty boxers have steeped in it for a few days.

And the hummus. Before tasting it, my wife said something cute and upbeat, something like;

\"This has mango in it, it should be delicious.\"

It wasn't. I never tasted mango or any hint of mango.
Instead, I felt like Napoleon Dynamite where he tastes onion in the cow's milk.
The hummus was overpowered by onion and had a strongly acidic bite. 
Completely inedible unless you're a hobo or something.

Basically, that's five for five, making me long for the use of Yelp pentagrams with which to rate this place instead of stars.

Three beers, five appy's, a fruity cocktail of some sort, a friendly server, flat screens mounted so high you'll crane your neck to watch them, and a drunk couple next to us PDA-ing themselves into the record books with the world's longest and sloppiest tongue kiss ever.
The couple was pretty entertaining however, as he groped the back-meat sausage-ing out from her way-too-tight sundress.
And all this for fifty bucks. 

I'm never going back.
Not unless I die and come back as shit, in which case, I'll use their kitchen to take a dump."}
{"text":"Calistro is currently celebrating their 1 year anniversary. You can get any small salad, entree and dessert for $30 per person.

My husband and I took advantage of this and were very glad we did.
I tried the Beet Salad - organic beet's, farmer's cheese, almonds, fresh orange and fennel pollen. It was delicious....the farmer's cheese was amazingly creamy and tasty and worked very well with the beets. My husband had the soup of the day which he said was very tasty.

For the entree I tried the crab cakes - red crab meat, wood roasted organic vegetables, baby greens, preserved lemon, tarragon.....this was unbelievably good! Highly recommend.
My husband had the filet mignon - all natural local beef, fingerling potatoes, roasted cauliflower, caramelized onions and tamarind bearnaise......he devoured it and loved it!

As usual the staff were wonderful....very helpful and knowledgeable. Don't miss this special : )"}
{"text":"too bad the wine list is limited, too expensive and the wines are way too hot. they need to learn how to serve red wine at the proper temperature."}
{"text":"The place has a great modern look w Rothko-ish paintings in the walls.  
Met 2 friends for dinner here (one had a Groupon for $50)... We missed happy hour (until 7) which sounds like a great deal (on their website). 
We split 3 items:  the hummus appetizer with amazing flatbread from the brick oven, the Mediterranean sausage flatbread/pizza (ditto) and the chicken sausage puttanesca. 
The hummus was terrific and we asked for more of that flatbread to finish it off.  The pizza was also very good, e.  I liked the puttanesca...but it was not spicy as I would have expected and the portion was small for the price (we told the manager and he brought us more noodles and sauce).  My friends thought the noodles were too al dente...but as I said, I liked it.   
Limited, but interesting beer selection (though glasses seemed small).  We didn't really check out the wine list. 
The staff is friendly and fun.  We enjoyed our visit and would come back (me for the beet salad).  It was a bit pricey (except the hummus)  - but the Groupon helped.  I think I'd try happy hour next time.
It's not a sports bar by any stretch - but the BB playoffs were on and the 2 flat screens are way too small unless you are right at the bar."}
{"text":"I am with Michelle L. and Kathleen K. on Calistro. It sounds like a lot of you have tried this place for happy hour, and I think maybe that is their real specialty. It is ridiculously over priced for dinner, and it is disappointing like Kathleen K. said that they nickle and dime you with everything. I thought the ambiance and decor was terrific but the meal was nothing out of this world. I had the falafel bites, and the falafel was way over done and tasted a bit burnt. I had Chicken Meatball Putenesca and my husband had the BBQ burger. Already these plates are 17-18 and do not come with  salad or fries, any extras are a la carte. This is my philosophy, I do not want a big portion, it is a waste of food and I am not going to finish it. So at least if these restaurants could add veggies and sides to the entree, make it worth my while. Forget dessert, we already spent 92.00 + a tip. I do not think they had much on the menu at all. But I think the other Yelper's out there had the right idea and went for happy hour. Maybe if there is a next time that is what we will do."}
{"text":"OK - we have dinner here most Friday nights. If you are regular, they really take care of you (thanks Scott, Nathan and Karen).

Brown, wilted looking avocado slices served and when we let them know we were not impressed we were greeted with a less than caring; oops, so sorry attitude.  

Well, we decided to try it once again at it's newest incarnation on Scottsdale Road and talk about a 180!  Woo haa!  I am so glad we went back for round two!  The manager Jerry chatted us up and was genuinely interested in our opinions on what was working now vs. what faux paus we witnessed then.  They had my friend try a new drink they were thinking of putting on the menu and she loved it!  (Way too HOT for my liking as it had a hot pepper in it......) but the food was really good, they accommodated my gluten free diet and the food was fresh and tasty!

We started with the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer, with veggies instead of crostini and it was divine!  They use Crow's Dairy cheese, which is as good as it gets!  This stuff was so good I could eat a bowl full for my lunch!  Nom nom.

Then I had the Fire Roasted Shrimp.  Spicy and delish.  Like major Delish.  It had Harissa flavored shrimp with feta, olives and more.  We had drinks that were very generous pours!

I'll be back again and again and again!  Round two was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is pretty awesome.  Food is A++ I must say.  I'm not a big fan of Americana food, but this place definitely impressed me.  I just had their BBQ Burger and it was popping.  I love the layout of the place; high ceilings and very open.  Their patio is pretty narrow but still awesome.  However only one small fire pit...then again we live in PHX.  Service was good...nothing to rave about, but our waiter was cool.  I was there during happy hour/dinner and it wasn't too busy so if you just want a good drink or two with a friend ... you know where to go ;)"}
{"text":"Limited atmosphere, exceedingly slow, bland food, and poor service."}
{"text":"Love the farm fresh concept, like the service, food varied from great down to alright and value was, eh... ok.

First, I want to applaud the \"Farm to Table\" concept - using local and organic is a nice selling point.  And the seafood did seem fresh, so they are doing something right!  Presentation is clearly a priority - both the food and the staff - they have been well trained and the ONLY staff in Phoenix to always follows the \"lower left, raise right\" service protocol!

So I -wanted- to give this place 4 stars.  But while I liked it, I'm just not going to add it to my heavy rotation. It's the value part of the equation - When I got the bill, I just felt like it was a bit too much to pay for what I got.

The Good:
* Chicken Sausage Flatbread: great app! Fresh veggies, thin, crisp bread and the hint-of-sweet pomegranate BBQ the perfect foil for the sausage.
* Pork Tenderloin: This was the best of the four dishes we ordered - tender, medium rare, laid atop the cornbread (a delicious sauce-delivery-mechanism) - very savory, well-rounded flavor.

The OK:
* Falafel Bites: good flavor, good presentation sitting on a slice of cucumber, but very tiny. For the four of us, the five small bites made us think \"amuse-bouche\".
* Prawn Pasta: three huge, gorgeous, tasty prawns amid an average pesto pasta.
* Tazmanian King Salmon: tender, flaky and with a good miso flavor.
* Chef's Special: It was fish, freshly flown from the Pacific, wrapped around crab, teetering atop the embellishments.  The dish was pleasant, tender, but lacked anything other than the presentation to make it remarkable.

All in all, I'd come here again if the prices were a bit lower - but while I'm watching my budget, there are other places in the valley that give as good food for less."}
{"text":"Bought a Local Dines coupon to this place and tried it this week for the first time.  I so wanted to like it.  It has an interesting menu, looked fresh and contemporary and casual and comfortable, and seemed to have friendly staff.  Unfortunately, the food fails on many levels.  Here goes...The lamb meatloaf is nothing more than a glorified lamb burger, shaped like a loaf, albeit decent on its own, but drenched in some awful, white, country style gravy full of ham chunks they call prosciutto.  While most of what we had was at least nicely presented, this one was not. They do offer a nice eggless, anchovy-less Caesar style salad, so that was nice for the fish allergy friend I was dining with. It was pretty decent considering. None of the mains appealed to me, so I ordered 3 apps. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in all of them.  Sweet potato croquettes for $4 sounded good and cheap. Unfortunately, they were only cheap. It was a large portion of overcooked tempura style chunks of sweet potatoes that were so heavily salted, I could not eat them, and I love salt. It came with a citrus dip that soured the sweetness of the potato; I didn't get the combination at all. The dip was not even listed on the menu. I then had the baked goat cheese, which was nothing more than goat cheese in a bowl, baked off and topped with some sort of bitter green pepper chopped up stuff.  I forget the name they gave it, but it was only listed on the menu as \"peppers\", so that was misleading too. Had it been described as what it was, I never would have ordered it. And the goat cheese itself was not even good. Can't believe it came from Crow's Dairy.  (The best gelato in town) I can usually eat goat cheese on a spoon straight from the container endlessly, but this one was totally ruined by their toppings. The plate was loaded with too many tasteless crostini, but there was nothing good to dip them in. I also ordered the beet salad, which was a terrine.  I mean really, goat cheese and beets. How can you screw that up? The beets were horrible.  No flavor and just bitter. When I told the waitress that the beets were not sweet, she said they are beets, they are not supposed to be sweet.  Seriously? The accompanying goat cheese \"mousse\" was nothing more than a blob of goat cheese on the plate. The spinach on the plate was drizzled with lemon vinaigrette, which was very sour and otherwise tasteless and unpleasant. The menu listed almonds as an ingredient, so I was expecting almonds. Instead, there was all of one almond crumbled up into 50 pieces and thrown on top as a garnish. Is that really worth listing on the menu? (Other than for nut allergic patrons I suppose)  So they list the one almond, but don't list a topping on a baked goat cheese that cannot be removed or a dip for croquettes that are a major part of the dish. Don't you find some restaurants list ingredients that are not relevant or plentiful, while missing others that are? This was one of those restaurants. The waitress was very nice, but you can tell she was getting frustrated at my complaints and she did not have the right skills to deal with them. She never sent the manager over, but did come back at one point and told me the items would be removed from my check. Nice touch, but how about some apology and some sincerity with that? At that point there was nothing more I wanted to eat and was pretty turned off, so just decided to take home some shrimp to make up the value of my coupon. Unfortunately, they even got that wrong, since I said make me as many shrimp orders as it takes to use up the value of my coupon. When they came, my coupon was short, and when I said I should have had another order of shrimp, the server got defensive and told me that she already took off two items and brought me free bread. Really? Free bread? Oh yes, they don't serve a basket of bread and butter/oil with your meal. The only bread they have is focaccia, but that's something you have to order off the menu. (Even tho it was not on the menu) When I looked perturbed at the fact that they didn't serve bread, some man offered to bring us complimentary focaccia. I didn't want it, I don't like focaccia, but my guests did. It came and it didn't look like any focaccia I've ever seen. Anyway, I'm off subject here, but when she told me they brought me free bread, I was pretty appalled, especially because I didn't ask for it. As you can see, it was not a very good evening since one thing was worse then the next. Oh yes, I tasted the shrimp when I got home and they were undercooked. They are luckily getting 2 stars, but that's only because I have had worse elsewhere."}
{"text":"Walking through the door you immediately appreciate the vibrant decor. The restaurant has a great flow and very welcoming feeling.  We ate in the booth and had nothing but great service.  For appetizers we tried the flatbread pizza which was awesome.  We also had the humus and meatballs and thought the meatballs stole the show.  For our entree we tried the bolognese pasta and and the meatloaf both cooked and prepared with quality and farm fresh ingredients. The bartender also did a good job sending me an assortment of different style cocktails which were eloquent and thoughtful along with a cab that was fairly priced and great tasting. 

We had a great time and would recommend this restaurant for a relaxing evening to enjoy food from a creative chef and great drinks from an up and coming bartender."}
{"text":"I, like other Yelpers out there are into the whole organic \"farm to table\" concept, so big ups there.

I won't tell you much different than other reviews about the decor or service, both were very nice.  

The food on the other hand seems to be getting very mixed reviews, which is the focus of this review.

For starters we had the chicken meatballs and the caprese.  The meatballs were tasty, although my friend thought they tasted off.  Flavors were simple and fresh, so that was a better part of my meal.

The caprese on the other hand was not as good.  Personal preference (and perhaps because I'm a traditionalist) is the tomatoes and mozzarella are sliced so that the can be eaten together - the salad was more of the \"cubed\" variety, with large chunks of tomato and mozzarella tossed with the shallot and dressing and presented on a plate but not really in an orderly fashion.  Granted, anybody can take pieces and cut them up and stack on a fork to get the medley of flavors together, but that seemed to be a little bit of a miss for me.  More importantly though, were the ingredients.  The mozzarella, while housemade, was good, it was no where near \"creamy\", rather it tasted almost too firm/dry.  Also, the heirloom tomatoes did not have as much flavor as I expect from heirlooms and were disappointing.  Could have certainly been a bad tomato, but I was hoping for something riper, sweeter, and overall tastier.  

Entrees were the short ribs and the duck confit flatbread.  The short ribs have gotten generally good reviews so I was eager to try them, and unfortunately they were average.  While the flavors were good, they were a touch overcooked, because while the meat was soft, there were parts that were dry and a little stringy.  Granted, it was late that we dined and they were probably would have been much better if we got them 1-2 hours prior.  The overall flavor was good (not great).  

Finally, the duck confit flatbread was very average.  The duck and portabello mushroom were a good combo and everything (including the Medjool date bbq sauce) tasted very \"umami\", but the flavors really didn't meld as much as they should have.

Overall, the idea is great, but menu and prep need to be refined a little bit for me to go back.  I'm always dumbfounded by 5 star reviews Yelpers give out like Cheerios to toddlers, which means either: a) I'm reviewing the wrong restaurant, b) the experience I had was just an off night (unlikely), or c) the reviewers really don't know what a 5 star restaurant should be.  Who knows.  This place has great potential, just missed the mark in my dining experience."}
{"text":"After receiving a kind note from the owner of Calistro about my \"2-star experience\", I had to give Calistro another chance. The owner explained that he had stepped away from the business and shouldn't have. He assured me that he is hands-on again and Calistro is back to his original conception. 

My boyfriend and I decided to visit for happy hour last week and had such a pleasant experience! Everyone was very attentive and helpful and the food was excellent. We created a tapas experience for ourselves, ordering a variety of appetizers. I'll sum up my thoughts on our order:

Hummus - I find most restaurant hummus is generally good. This falls into that category. A nice creamy consistency and fresh flat bread resulted in a cleaned plate. 

Lamb meatballs - These were interesting. They were served with pickled julienned vegetables and gorgeous bright green large leaves of lettuce. Our server said they're meant to be eaten lettuce wrap style and I'm not one to break rules.... I enjoyed them and only wished for more meatballs. 

Fire Roasted Shrimp - YUM! This had excellent flavor. I loved the roasted vegetables and the seasoning. Will definitely be having this one again. 

Crab Cakes - I had these the first time I went to Calistro and remembered liking them. My memory didn't fail me. Two small crab cakes are served with a small mixed green salad. Great combo of flavors. 

Braised Pork Taco a la carte - I was a little nervous about this one because on my last visit the pork was vastly over-salted, but my boyfriend insisted. I'm so glad we tried them! The pork was delicious... tender and very well seasoned. It was topped with pickled vegetables and had a cream sauce served on the side. Excellent!

I also ordered \"That Spicy Mango Thingy\" off the drink menu. It's basically a margarita made with serrano chile and mango infused tequila. I couldn't really taste the mango but the serrano gave it a very interesting bite. If you like a little spice in your life, give it a try! 

After typing all of this out, I'm realizing how much we ate (slighly embarrassed!) It was worth it. Calistro, you have most definitely redeemed yourself. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very good food they make it with love. The happy hour from 3 to 6 and from 9 to close kicks ass. 

Big props to the staff they try and it shows."}
{"text":"Went here last night on a localdines.com coupon.
The waitress was great!  Very friendly and prompt (the place was virtually empty).  
We found the food to be very over priced and very plain/bland.  
I had the chicken picotta which was served over grilled asparagus and hot potato salad.  Small portion, the chicken was overcooked and overall, it was very bland.
My husband had  a pasta dish that barely filled the bowl and was bland as well as sparse.
We had to hunt for a yogurt place afterwords to fill up after dinner!
Appearance wise it is okay.  Nothing special, kind of boring.
We will not be going back.
Save your $$ and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a friend yesterday for their happy hour and fish tacos.  One of the most expensive happy hours I have ever attended in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and I have lived here 10 years!!  The house martini was $8.00 for happy hour, Svedka, and you can buy a big bottle at Total Wine for 16.99----wine was about $8.00/glass happy hour price--geez---go to Morton's. Fleming's--anywhere, my fish taco was fine for $3.00, although the bartender told me it would be salmon, it was some type of white fish, Bill ordered the shrimp taco---blackened, so very salty, we could not eat it!!!  The fries were also very spicey and you could only eat the top layer so as not to get all the spice.  All in all one of the very worst dining/happy hour experiences we have had in the 10 years we have lived here.  Do the owners have any idea of their competition and the market out there?!!  I would suggest do not even try this place!"}
{"text":"Great dinner.  The crab cake appetizer were probably the best I've ever had.  Ordered their short rib plate.  It was good and tasty but not great.  The mashed potatoes that it came with were really good though. Also, we had great service.  Might go again, except that it's pricey.  GF had their duck flatbread. I didn't like it much, but she really liked it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We live in the neighborhood and our choices of non- chain resturaunts is very limited. Suffice to say I would not recommend this resturaunt. The staff and service was great but I was very dissapointed in the flavors and the freshness of our meal. We started with the Lamb Meatballs. These were mushy and tasted off. These are served with lettuce cups and the lettuce was wilted and not crisp. . We then had the house salad with the lemon dressing. Again, the salad was wilted and not fresh tasting. I'm a HUGE lover of lemon but the dressing was so bitter we couldn't take another bite. My meal was actually pretty good. The salmon over veggie hash. The salmon didn't taste fresh and it was a tad dry but the hash made up for it. Hash was yummy. Like I said, I wish the food was better as I like the concept and the staff of this place. I just couldn't get past the fact that the majority of the meal tasted off or wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely. Amazing. Name a liquor and they infuse it here in house and they are delicious. Roasted pork is delicious, crab cakes are amazing and they have a great beet salad. The staff was extremely helpful and allowed us to try everything  Come here often."}
