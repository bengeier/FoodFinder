{"text":"This place definitely deserves a higher rating ! The food was delicious - we tried 7 unique types of tartars and we received excellent service."}
{"text":"Cuisine de grande qualité à prix plus que raisonnable. Les plats sont exquis. L endroit est vraiment agréable."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating tartar and not the last. Portions were small so we had a side dish of fries. The dessert was also amazing. It basically looked like a huge donut filled with cream of some sort. Will return soon!!!"}
{"text":"Nous recherchions LE restaurant sacré Tartare et nous avons été bluffé ! Décor bistro très agréable, les tartares (magret et saumon) étaient excellents, sans être extraordinaires. En revanche côté plats, le risotto de canard, était un délice.  Bémol, le mille feuille de morue était trop salé. Je l'ai indiqué, et le service était un peu lent pour un restaurant qui n'était pas vraiment comble... Nous recommandons fortement car le reste de la carte est à essayer à tout prix. Nous y retournerons certainement"}
{"text":"I love the idea of tapas style tartares and this place delivers on that 100%. From trout to horse, the variety of raw meat offered is rare and very tasty! Also, they hand out bread before the main course, which I find to be a rare event in Montreal. The bread isn't great but that's not why you come here.  I give it 4 stars because I'm not a huge fan of the ambiance/decor. On the other hand, we ate here on a Tuesday night so maybe we didn't get the full effect of a bustling restaurant.  tartares to try: the salmon with shrimp chips and the tuna/veal mix. I was a little disappointed with the duck but my bf liked it."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé le bar cru du Bistro Lustucru un mardi soir avec mon copain. L'ambiance est chaleureuse et l'espace aéré, on s'y installe et on n'a pas envie de se dépêcher. Le menu est varié côté tartares et la carte des vins est à découvrir. Le service au début a été particulièrement lent, ce qui nous a un peu inquiété pour la suite, mais nous avons changé de serveuse (pas à notre demande) et ça s'est replacé. Le menu indiquait un tartare de bison et ce n'est qu'en étant prêts à commander que nous avons appris qu'il s'était transformé en tartare de cheval...petite déception. J'apprécie qu'on me spécifie les altérations au menu quand on me le donne, pas une fois mon choix fait...Toutefois, aucune déception sur les mets commandés. Tartare de cheval, carpaccio de cheval, duo veau et thon rouge et tartare de magret de canard accompagnés d'une frite et une bouteille de vin furent amplement suffisant pour nous 2. Le prix est élevé, mais quand on a de la qualité et des agencements recherchés, il faut s'y attendre. J'y retournerais pour partager un tartare et prendre une bière avant d'aller voir un spectacle dans les environs, mais pas pour un autre souper. Suggestion: réservez à l'avance!"}
{"text":"Awesome tartare, go with a group and get 1 (or 2) \"La Totale\" plates to try out as many variations as possible."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in town, period. The tartare is to die for - literally. For 2 or 3 people who enjoy raw food, I would suggest taking \"La Totale\", which is a platter of each tartare they make. For those who prefer their meals cooked, the changing menu (plats de résistance) which appear on the chalkboard have yet to deceive - I've had about 5 different plates and each one was tasty, surprising and just as excellent as the last. The desserts are also amazing, especially the \"fondant au chocolat, caramel et fleur de sel\" served with ice cream - perfect mix of sweet & salty.  The downside to me is that the service is occasionally a little cold, and it can take a while before the waiter makes his way to your table. It has not happened regularly but good service is a must and should be constant. Also, I must admit that it is pricey for the portions (especially the tartars), but the quality makes it worth it. If it was a little less expensive, I'd be there at least once a week! One of my top food experiences in Montreal."}
{"text":"Je voulais manger un tartare, différent du tartare typique que l'on voit dans la majorité des menus à travers le reste j'ai été plus que servi. Frais, bon, original, bon vin et bel ambiance bravo"}
{"text":"FOOD / SIGNATURE DISH This place serves beef and non-beef variations on steak tartare with surgical precision. Execution and presentation are near-perfect. They also have excellent and affordable bottles of Saint-Nicolas de Bourgueil on their wine list (private import).  DECOR / ATMOSPHERE Vast, clean and elegantly contemporary. Lots of smart details. I loved the wooden tables, original but comfortable.  FEATURES / SERVICE Oh well, that's the problem here. Service is aloof. Our waitress mixed up our orders and forgot half of it... We ended up frustrated like you wouldn't believe. It it weren't for her ridiculous unprofessionalism, our experience would have been top notch."}
{"text":"This restaurant was my first mtl à table and it started off on the wrong foot.   Here is what happened, my girl and I walk in to a nearly empty restaurant and asked for a table for two. The unwelcoming hostess looks through her list of reservations and said \"I may be able to squeeze you at the bar.\" The place had about 20 available seats and no in line to get in but ourselves, I was confused. In the end, about 5 mins later, she gave us a table.   The great redemption: the food! It was spot on. I would say come in and order the \"risky\" plates. The menu has a large list of unique tartar and I say order whatever your foodie heart desires. The kitchen is on point. The food came quickly, the flavours were on point, well plated and perfect portions. 4 1/5 stars on the food!  The horrible: the service needs to improve. The hostess and our first waitress were not on point last night. The problem getting a seat and the unhelpful waitress did deteriorate our experience at this establishment. The second waitress was very pleasant, I hope, if you choose to go, you get her as your waitress. 1 star for service.   In the end, I would absolutely recommend that you try this place. The food is desirably delicious. I say take advantage of mtl à table and eat here; for the price you will not regret. With regards to the service, I pray you get a better experience than what we had."}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!   I came in on a Tuesday night and it was completely empty, thought maybe because it was a Tuesday? But quickly learned that it was a sign from the universe warning me to turn right back around and run!  Let me explain why you should run, far away.  We ordered the veal and salmon tartares, lapin raviolis. They also had some new items on the menu we tried, like the salmon belly and tuna tataki. Everything came all at once, fine. The veal was not a tartare at all, it was 3 thick sliced pieces of veal, overcooked on the perimeter and a weird mush texture in the centre. The tuna tataki was prepared similarly but much thicker, like an inch and a half thick. Raw fish should never be served that thick, I couldn't even bite into it or chew. It felt like they didn't know what tuna tataki was or how it's really supposed to be prepared; just threw tuna on the plate and gave it a familiar name. When I thought it couldn't get worse, I tried the salmon belly and was proven very wrong. This dish was just slices of low quality smoked salmon, yup, straight from a  grocery store. It was all really disappointing.   Everyone has different tastes and so criticizing food  is oftentimes arbitrary. My friend I came with had been there before and recommended the place but pointed out that it was nothing like before. We asked the manager if perhaps it was because the chef or management changed?   Her reaction and answer was beyond all reason. She seemed aggressed and said that my opinion was USELESS because they have many clients that dine there multiple times a week (does this mean they don't need new clientele?) Her approach was extremely arrogant. I have never felt more insulted in a restaurant. She made me feel as if I was some silly child and didn't know what I was talking about or that it was my first time eating out. She did nothing to try to mediate the situation or provide the most adequate customer service... not even a half ass apology!!!! Or a slight interest as to maybe why I didn't enjoy the food. It was a hurtful experience. $150 and still tipped the server because it isn't her fault the management sucks.   This place deserves 0 stars. If you want to visit, be my guest but proceed with caution as you have been forewarned."}
{"text":"Pour ma 3ième visite au Bistro Lustucru, j'ai eut la chance d'essayer le menu Montréal en lumière, douze bouchés du menu cru, en fait une dégustation de l'ensemble du menu tartares, carpaccio et ceviche. Quoique tous très bon, les poissons étaient excellents! Les portions tenaient plus de la portion bouché pour ogre qu'un estomac normalement constitué.  Les service était, comme toujours impéccable. Définitivement prêt pour une 4ième visite."}
{"text":"C'était très bon mais effectivement les portions sont décevantes pour le prix (entre 12 et 16$ pour des toutes petites portions de tartares) Par contre, le plat qu'on a essayé (flanc de porc) était copieux et très bon, pour 18$ Il y a aussi une option, tous les tartares de la carte pour 115$ (pas mal si on est 3 ou 4) Le dessert etait excellent, mais tous les dessert sont à 8$, ce qui est un peu dispendieux aussi Excellent service, grosse carte de vins A essayer tout de meme"}
{"text":"SO good! Raw bar portions are small though, so don't expect much. But nonetheless amazing. I had a salmon tartare with coriander and avocado and it was so delicious! My friend had a flavorful perfect scallop ceviche served in a small shooter glass. It wasn't too strong or citrusy which I liked. For the main I had a raclette, I'm not sure how to translate it but it's basically melted/grilled cheese with potatoes, cold cuts, and king mushroom. Oh! And some carmelized onions on the side (which were so sweet and tasty) I had some fries which were skinny and thin, served in a small cup. THAT was also good too. They were very potato-y. My friend had a nice Kir to drink. Service was excellent, friendly, and enthusiastic. Prices are slightly pricey, but that's French food for you. Other than that, I really enjoyed my experience there. I would go back to try the other tartares ."}
{"text":"3 stars for really delicious food. Knocked off 2 stars for awful service. So I've been lurking a few foodie Instagram accounts for awhile, but one that always stuck out to me was Lustucru's gorgeous presentation. Come MTL à Table event, I was excited to try their menu.  Good : The food. Is. Top. Notch. Wow, everything just tasted so fresh and amazing. Our second waitress was very cordial and friendly, and the food was brought out promptly. The decor is cozy, nice looking spot.  Bad : So I arrived early for dinner at the restaurant without a reservation and it was pretty empty. A good sign that we will get seats and our food quickly! Well, the hostess informed us that it's full...excuse me? 1/3 occupied seats is not full. She said maybe we can sit at the bar. I was okay with it, but then she had to go speak with someone, make some phone calls, and then confirmed that they had seats available. My boyfriend wanted to get the 3 course MTL a Table menu and I wanted to get some tartares (it looked so good on Instagram...). When we were ready to order, the first waitress insisted that we both have to order off the MTL à Table menu or we both have to order from the regular menu because it's restaurant policy. The reasoning? They have separate kitchens. At a glance, the open kitchens are right next to each other. Then she tells us that the regular menu has the MTL a Table items too and we can order off the regular menu. So with that logic, the second kitchen makes the same items? I was pissed off, what kind of restaurant tells their clients they can't order items from their menu? What the hell is the point of having a menu if you're not even going to give your patrons the choice of what they want to eat? I was ready to leave.   Bottom Line : Go for the food, it's amazing. However, their staff and restaurant policies are a bit off."}
{"text":"Quaint joint with interesting decor. Staff are friendly. Menu is entirely French but the staff will explain it. Good selection of tartare. I prefer the traditional tartars but this joint offers some interesting combinations and flavors. Love that they have hot food as well and not-so traditional dishes. The pork chops served in a creamy bacon sauce is scrumptious. The duck confit and strawberry salad is amazing. Will definitely go back. Overheard the table next to us say that the menu changes as well."}
{"text":"Tout est excellent!  pour les amateurs de tartares c'est un must. Super cadre pour un dîner en amoureux. Le seul bémol c'est que c'est très cher pour les portions proposées!"}
{"text":"Okay, let's be real, a restaurants review is based on a lot more than the food - for some places this is a good thing, but unfortunately not for Lustucru  Food : amazing. Big thumbs up to the chef. We had a tasting platter which consists of 8 choices. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the food. **the food and wine is the only reason I'm not giving this place a 0 (if that's even possible)**  Service : a big flat zero. Barely checked up on us, seemed annoyed to be there, no knowledge (ex.: asked her a question and she basically just read me the menu..)  Decor : it's okay, but would amp it up to distract people from the lousy staff.   No I wouldn't bring friends here but I would recommend this place ONLY FOR THE FOOD - meaning that it's only for people who don't mind bad service."}
{"text":"Very good with a nice ambiance and decor. Service really great. Price on the high end but will definitively go back!"}
{"text":"Tartars are for sure their specialty and what they're famous for. The tartar selection is very broad(salmon, tuna, duck, beaf, horse.. to name a few) good and tasty. I did however find the sauces for some a little heavy. The portion are not very generous as well relative to the price. The chocolate fondant was exquisite, out of this world! I highly recommend it (we ordered it twice). Staff was very friendly however service was slow. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Bon...  Nous avons été oubliés pendant plus de 30 minutes, avant qu'une serveuse s'occupe de nous.  Le service laissait grandement à désirer, surtout quand on doit demander plus de trois fois la même chose avant de l'obtenir.  Le sourire ne semble pas être la marque de commerce de ce restaurant. La nourriture était bonne (pas à se jeter par terre) et la présentation agréable. Les quantités convenables quand on partage. Bref, un endroit qui gagnerait à améliorer son service."}
{"text":"Meilleur repas depuis un bon bout ! Nous avons pris la Totale à 3 personnes séparé en 2 services, poissons crues et viande crues. Je peux vous dire que chaque personne on été rassasiés, si quelqu'un se demandait si les portions sont suffisantes. C'était une expérience réussie sur tout la ligne. Le choix de vins du sommelier ont été sans reproches. Le personnel le est courtois et professionnel. Les prix ne sont pas exagérés pour la qualité de la nourriture. À essayer absolument!"}
{"text":"The tartare here is creative, delicious, and all very different! The service was lovely, the ambience was rustic but modern.   - Fluke tartare with avocado on a fried risotto cake - This was probably my favorite. The risotto cake was crispy and hot, tender on the inside. The cold tartare paired with the warm cake was perfect.   - Haddock and prawn ceviche, mashed black beans, and tortilla chips - This had a bit of a Mexican flair to it. I could probably have done without the beans, but still very tasty.   - Horse tenderloin carpaccio, quail egg, foie gras - This was the second time I've had horsemeat. It's slightly gamey, though the flavors are good. For the more adventurous eater, I'd say.  - Bison tartare with marinated mushroom - I loved the mushrooms, and the bison was flavorful and delicious.  - Duck tartare with apple - I love duck, and this was amazing, paired with crispy fresh apples. The perfect pairing.  Such a variety of protein and again, very fun! Portions are a bit small so be prepared to order several."}
{"text":"We were there last winter for a group party. OK, I know groups can be overwhelming for waiters. But the service was really bad, although pretty quiet of a night that day. The server was unprofesionnal and soooo didn't care. We waited for a long time to get our dishes.   The aps were good. We had sweetbreads & foie gras. Speaks for itself, yum ! However, we shared the tartar tasting (you get a bit of everything) and felt like it was totally overrated. Not worth the price at all - we've had much better tartars elsewhere for much cheaper! With wine & service, ended up with a bill of nearly 200$ for two. I won't be back."}
{"text":"RESTO: nice ambience, good lighting, modern, trendy, rustic FOOD: Absolutely delicious, great flavours, nice variety SERVICE: Absolutely terrible, ruined any hopes of a fabulous meal. The waitress was inattentive, rude, and impersonal. sat with water for too long before ordering or any contact with staff. Staff needed prompting for service and even to pay our bills. Should've dined and dashed, currently sitting in PiZza pizza across the street having poppers, ready in 6 mins, warm delicious and with a welcoming smile."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh tasting tartares! It wasn't my first time here and after more than a year i came back and its still just as good. We had the tatare de cardeau ( top left), beef tartare ( top right), vitello tonato ( bottom left) and gravlax de truite. Everything tasted great except the gravlax, ive had it in the past but they completely changed it. The combination just didn't work for me. For the other 3 we tried, seasonings weren't over powering and you could still taste the greatness of the meat. Not a huge fan of beef tartare but this one was really good. Portions look small but i shared with a friend and it was more than enough for 2."}
{"text":"Tout est toujours excellent et super service !! Tartare de canard wow ! J'adore et j'y retournerai!! :)"}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  I love Tartar and this place is Tartar at a whole new level. I'm telling all my friends about it.  Once you try this place, no other Tartar comes close to this. They all feel like a waste of money.  I think they put some magic spell in it because this stuff has been on my mind everyday since I tried it. I litterally sweat when I get a craving!! Ill keep it simple : TRY EVERYTHING!   If you're a sangria lover like me : Get The Apple Sangria  Tastes Juicy and magnificent and makes me wish I can drink it for breakfast everyday.  If you want to experience this place to the fullest, expect to spend about $50-60 ( 2 people / split bill- 1 drink ). With this you can get a few different types of Tartar and be fully satisfied.  The service: my waiter was a little bla and didnt really seem friendly but honestly I just dont care because Im there for the beautifully crafted, majestic, heaven-like Tartar   Yup... Ive lost my mind!!!  Magic spell I tell you!!!  Hope this review was helpful! :)"}
