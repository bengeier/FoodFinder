{"text":"We just moved to the area and got food from here after a day of work. The pizza was great, the crust was some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the staff was super welcoming and nice. The steak sandwiches were good and the sides were generous. Get the fried provolone. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best hoagies around. They are made with Mancinis bread. They also have homemade fried provolone and they are so good. The white pizza there is also another one of my favorites."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here often. Way better than the two chain stores down the street. Pizza's are awesome. Subs are great and the calzones are amazing. Even salads and wings are good. A bit pricier than the chains, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Food is great, wait time isnt long, and the people that work there are really friendly. We go here all the time!"}
{"text":"All I can say is, they have the best hoagies. I can't wait to taste their pizza, I'm sure it won't disappoint me! They won me over, if you believe every negative comments about a review on an establishment ( the few there are) then you are missing something good. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I hate writing this review as i try to support local mom and pop shops but ive been here twice and both were very disappointing.

My first visit was opening day of the 2015 pirates season at lunch. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and seasoned wings.
The wings were ok not bad not great 6/10.
The pizza was absolutely disgusting it was soggy and i ate a half slice total when i bit into it I tasted something solid. I was unable to tell what it was I bit after examining it it looked like either a fingernail or peice of plastic. I said I'd never go here again. 

Fast forward to tonight superbowl sunday i order hot wings and fried Provolone because i didnt fell like driving anywhere and wanted wings.
The wings were again decent until the last one it tasted like dust. 
The fried Provolone has good reviews here but i don't know how. The cheese was like rough jello and it tasted like dust.
I hate daying this but if you have any other options don't choose here."}
{"text":"Veltre's is great for delivery. I was particularly impressed with their steak sandwiches, and their wings are surprisingly good as well. The pizza is great too. For those living in Churchill and Forest Hills, a Veltre's menu is a must on your shelf."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to get white pizza. That's our most frequent order. Fresh dough daily. 
The steak sandwiches are also excellent and steak wraps are also good.
We are loyal regulars."}
{"text":"I drive past this place on my way to work and it interested me so I decided to give it a try. After reading the reviews on here I was encouraged. I ordered the highly talked about fried provolone and a pizza. 

The provolone was 100% tasteless which was really disappointing. 

The pizza was nothing special either. It lacked taste. Seemed to be a theme with this place!

The place is practically a hole in the wall, which didn't bother me. The service was okay, the man taking my order seemed annoyed to have to answer the phone. 

The pricing is a little bit of a rip off. $18 for provolone and a medium pizza."}
{"text":"Last week I had philly steak hoagie fries and onion rings it was all hot and tasty. That was my first time . Today I decided to do it again but this time food was room temp and hoagie was so soggy had to eat with knife and fork couldn't pick it up. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"What happened to Veltre's? That's what I wondered as I approached the shop. It's under a new name now, but not sure if the owner's are same or related. The phone numbers are the same, but when I called no one answered. So, I went in to check things out and it looked the same as I remembered, only the menu had changed. So I ordered 2 Calzones--meatball and steak! Twenty fast smartphone minutes later and they were ready! Both were huge and heavy,  loaded with meat, sauces, pizza cheeses and ricotta. Overwhelmed by their appearance, I had forgot to ask for extra marinara sauce, but the shop owner or manager was quick and asked if I needed any. The sauce was tasty, not too sweet or thick, just right for dipping that crust. Speaking of crust, my only wish would be that all the ingredients were in each bite. There was huge crust ends with no ingredients, so I just dipped them in the sauce...but not everyone in my family like crusty ends. It also could've used a bit more  meat, however, overall their Calzones will satisfy the hangry! :)))"}
{"text":"Great pizza - everyone devours it and it's hard to ever order enough!  They're apparently using the same great recipe and ingredients as they were under Veltre's name, since the pizza is as consistent and good as ever.  At the top of the list to get when visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Disorganized. Poor customer service. Food not all that. So many other better pizza places in the region."}
{"text":"This was a random google search for some good wings and fries. Went on Yelp and so glad we did! It was so delicious and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! My family and I are so full and happy with our decision!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza at a decent price that's ready in 20 minutes or less.  It's nothing to write home about, but it works in a pinch."}
{"text":"The pizza was great.  However,  when I placed my order I said I had a $25 restaurant.com gift card. They said that was fine.  When I picked up my order they said they only offered $5 off through restaurant.com. I paid the difference but not happy about it"}
{"text":"Really solid local pizza place that has great food and reliable delivery. There is no question that this is now my go-to place when I have a hankering for pizza. The pizza is always cooked well and the crust is quite nice. Great customer service and always pick up the phone right away and take your order immediately. Really happy with this place and will continue to order from here regularly!"}
{"text":"Ok pizza when you've been drinking. Little to no sauce on the pizza, it's also very salty for some reason. The dough is crispy, but chewy too. Will probably get again, but only in desperate times."}
{"text":"This may have been the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. The ingredients were fresh and the sauce is very unique. I highly recommend this pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely a solid 4 stars after we discovered that Veltre's has the best cheese pizza we've ever had.  The kids loved it, and the adult guests ate the rest - we'll have to order it again to figure out what the secret is, because there's no pizza left."}
{"text":"*THIS IS MY 100th REVIEW!!! YAYYYYY!!!!*


We have seen (and smelled) this little shop at the bottom of our hill for the longest time now, but we have never once ordered from them. Yesterday was the perfect day to order, so we did. Our pizza was an XL Broccoli and Cheddar and an order of fried mushrooms. They took credit card over the phone, and we are within their limited-delivery range. Good on all accounts! 

The pizza arrived, and it was pretty big! It also smelled phenomenal. It was truly a lovely looking pizza, and it didn't have too much broccoli or too little broccoli. The flavors were perfect. The dough was that nice mix of soft and crunchy, flavorful and cheesy. The sauce, cheese and topping balance was an excellent ratio. It tasted like a gourmet pizza that I would have expected to pay much more for. 

Now, the fried mushrooms were something special. I don't think they were housemade, but I could be wrong. Wherever and however they were made was absolutely perfect. I love mushrooms, and I love fried mushrooms. A lot of places can't get it right, but these were delicious. I only wish we had thought to ask for a side of ranch or blue cheese. 

Overall, I am really excited about Jake & Son's. I think we will be coming here much more frequently, and it makes me feel good to support a local business. This place is DEFINITELY better than Domino's or Pizza Hut, and if you can't see that, you need a tastebud check."}
{"text":"Solid yummy pizza good dough, decent sauce and the right amount of topping : cheese: sauce ratio.  We tried this place over two nights so other items ordered were the hot Italian sausage sub, club sandwich, and a Calzone. 

Oh and hot wings.
Not surprisingly the hot wings are number two on my yum list behind the pizza they are decent. Pa wings still can't touch my home state ny wings but these were good on flavor and spice right amount of fried crunch.

The sausage was good its a ton of food if you're hungry I wish the veggies were a but more fresh grilled. They tasted canned or jarred not my favorite.

The calzone dough and crust were perfect but the cheeses used inside left a little to be desired I would pass on the calzone.  

The club sandwich was just basic American cheese ad deli meat on wonder bread, I think we added tomatoes, it was not worth ordering. 

Edit note name is changed to Jake and Sons pizza I messaged yelp about it."}
{"text":"You know what? I'm done with this pizza shop. Over time and many pizzas ordered, it is increasingly common to expect inconsistent quality, and my pizzas have arrived burnt on the bottom more often than they should - which is never. I've had to call to complain and get another one, and quite frankly I'm not the customer that will do that because it's \"you do it right or you don't\" as far as I'm concerned. I've had enough borderline burnt pizzas here that I've tolerated. Today I got another burnt one. I caught the delivery guy (who I tipped over 5 bucks for the delivery) when I saw the product and before he drove away. I told him to give the owner a message.\"Tell whoever made the pizza that it's burnt, and I'm tired of getting burnt pizzas. If you can't get it right, I'm done with you.\"
No call back from the shop, so I guess they just don't give a crap...or maybe their attitude extends to their drivers...I don't know. Maybe he didn't deliver the message.
I'm done. In my opinion, you're tossing the dice. It may be great, or it may be black on the bottom. I do not recommend this place any longer, and that pains me because I want more than anything to support local businesses, versus the big chains. Used to be great. I don't know why it's so hard to deliver consistent quality, but they do not, in my opinion."}
