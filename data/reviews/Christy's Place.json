{"text":"NEVER will I go back there again. I ordered a hamburger and fries. Simple, right? NOT!! waited 30 minutes to get a Black, Burnt, Charred Hamburger and the fries were so brown they were almost black. Paid $7.96 (including a tea) The worst money I have ever SPENT!!! I guess my first clue should of been that their phone had been out for weeks. There are plenty of other places to go in the area, I will be going to one of them. NOT CHRISTY'S PLACE...."}
{"text":"Was a good place to eat, quick and easy to get in and out of, friendly staff, but has gone out of business."}
{"text":"Big breakfast at a great price. I had the Chrissy Big Breakfast and it was very good. Prefer this type of restaurant over big chains. This is where the locals eat."}
