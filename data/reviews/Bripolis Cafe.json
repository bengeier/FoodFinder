{"text":"Great burgers and fries for a really good price , but there is no soda machine and the place is sort of hidden ."}
{"text":"So I went to the lab last Sunday for the first time after being recommended by a co worker. He told me all about the burgers but once I got there that went out the window as soon as I saw the carne asada fries with shrimp. They were delicious the service was phenomenal and on top of that the complementary chips and dip were delicious. I will definitely be coming back here very soon. The next time I go back I will definitely try out the burgers."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a gourmet burger off the strip in a relaxing environment this place is for you! These burgers a priced far below their value. The owner was friendly and the food was fantastic! We had the Guacamole Burger, Pastrami Burger, and Garlic Parmesan Fries. We were also served homemade tortilla chips and delicious salsa. The patties appear to be homemade, hand-pressed, and very fresh. No complaints! Take a drive and try it out!"}
{"text":"Surf  n turf fries  were bomb , A1 burger was good and customer service was great shoutout to Lorenzo!"}
{"text":"The other yelp reviews are correct!   This place has great food!   They toast the buns so they don't get soggy, which I love!   The wings were very good and the bulgogi burger and American burger were great.   Service was excellent also,, try this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night, they were clearly busy and seemed understaffed. It took a while to place our order. We came because we saw the pictures on Instagram, when we got there none of that was on the menu. He told us that it wasn't on the menu but didn't explain if we could order that or not. It took a really long time for the food to come out. He explained that a cook had cut himself and had a big group ahead of us so we were aware it would be a minute. The bulgogi burger was really good, fries were good and Cali chick was decent - prob should stick with the specialty, burgers. I'm giving it 4 stars because they apologized numerous times for the wait and only charged us $20. I will be giving them a try again because of the customer service alone, and hope to have a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"I met my brother and my niece at La Parilla on a Tuesday for lunch.  We were there at noon and we were literally the only customers in the restaurant.  There was a man sitting near the door, I had no idea he worked there because he was texting very intently but he came over and took my drink order.  The place is very clean and spacious.  My niece had a hard time finding it because it is in the back of a complex that didn't have many cars in it but she finally found it.  When the server came over, we all ordered the BLT Burger, I ordered it well done with no tomatoes and mayo on the side.  My brother asked for his burger medium well, no tomatoes and EXTRA mayo.  My niece ordered it medium well and NO mayo!  I figured there was a 99% chance he would confuse this so I repeated the order.  We also ordered regular fries and garlic parm fries.  It took a while for the food to come out considering we were the only ones there.  My burger was a little bit pink inside (remember I ordered it well done), but I was so hungry by then since I skipped breakfast anticipating all of the calories so I ate it anyway.  The burger was delicious!  Super juicy and a lot of lettuce so I felt I got my veggies in!  The fries were hot and delicious, I really liked the garlic fries.  The service was slow and there was an error with my burger, but I would come back and try it again.  It was $35 for our 3 burgers and 2 baskets of different fries so price is right."}
{"text":"I only leave reviews if I think there is good value and good food. I had the gulgogi burger, 5 orange wings and 5 sweet chili wings. You know its a good burger when there is no need to add any condiments.  I will be going back can't wait to try a different burger."}
{"text":"The worse pastrami hamburger in my life. Im so sorry I went here. The reviews were good but the food was extremely bad. The pastrami was thick like ham and the burger was overloaded with a thick unappealing chili. The patty was dry and the burger looked liked a sloppy joe made by a teenager. The fries were lukewarm and dry. I couldnt even tell the server how bad the food was without embarrasing my server.  I just paid the $10.70 tab and left and would never come back. I wanted to personally call the owner and inform him/her how bad the hamburger was. I sure hope this place improves and survives .  

The problem is this place is a mexican restaurant and a burger joint ( a strange combination that does not work)  and the cook obviously is experienced in Mexican food but cannot make a basic hamburger . you have to be a lousy cook to make one of the worse hamburgers in memory"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend and his cousin. First time, we each got different burgers and different a fries. AWESOME! This place is very unique! If you go on their IG they have secret menu items. Which I got the cheesecake shake! A strawberry shake with a whole slice of cheesecake in the middle of it!!! So amazing!! 
Three burgers, three fries, a soda, onion rings, and a shake was $50!!! So it was a bit pricey but the taste was awesome."}
{"text":"I've lived in LV for a few years and today decided to Yelp a burger craving. With my GF co piloting I knew the cross streets weren't in the best restaurant area. Don't let the location or the storefront view turn you away. We had the guacamole burger and the pastrami-chile burger. The ingredients were fresh, the bread was lightly toasted and you could hear it with just the right crispness as you bite into it. The French fries were plentiful and delicious. 
This is a no frills burger joint with a very attentive staff and one of the best burgers I've had in a long time, highly recommend this small business, we need more like this in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a few days ago. They had a very good menu with tons of great selections. The ingredients were all fresh and the burger was excellent. It was well done but still very juicy and taste fantastic. The onion rings were good too which is a plus because my girlfriend is very picky when it comes to onion rings haha."}
{"text":"Went here cause i seen the shrimp fries on instagram lookd bomb so i went,Food was hella expensive n tasted like ass...nevr again"}
{"text":"My daughter has been trying to get me to try this place and I'm glad I finally did.  We greeted with a smile and ask to excuse the renovation that was going on.  We ordered off the secret menu they post on Instagram.  The food is delicious and I'll definitely be going back there are a lot of things on the menu that I wanna try. Note if you like shrimp you have to have the cheddar shrimp salad it is sooooooo good ."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE RIPS YOU OFF!!

Came into the place to have the guy told us about the \"special menu\" on Instagram. And without noticing the filters, i immediately wanted to order the fries with shrimp/chicken and also the wings/shrimp. The guy rather had me ordered the shrimp/steak but nah. When the food came out, the wings looked like they were dipped in oil. The fries was cold. Also we asked for water, and we got bottled water. The result of this meal was $45. $3 for a bottled water. $18-$20 for each plate. And also 0.50 charge for using a credit card."}
{"text":"A little hole in wall place but great food and good raves. Must eat there again. Next pastrami burger."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS IN LAS VEGAS ! BEST FRENCH FRIES IN LAS VEGAS ! Second time here me and my boyfriend might just become regulars ! Today we had the blue lagoon burger , the BLT burger which comes with bacon lol and garlic Parmesan fries ! Amazinggggg !  I found them on Instagram months ago and the food taste as good as it looks !"}
{"text":"First time here and it is delicious! Got the American burger and it was nice and juicy! Also got a side of fries and they were seasoned well! They offer free chips and salsa and the salsa was amazing. It had a good spice to it to add the taste! 

Definitely a go to place for me!"}
{"text":"Ok. Read the reviews. They understate what is going on here. 

When I arrived at 6:15 on a Thursday the place was empty. Scary. Decided to go for it. In twenty minutes the place was packed!

Good call. The A1 burger is and the chili cheese fries will scare a cardiologist to death. 

Pray that Guy the Menace from DDD does not discover this place and turn it into yet another tourist trap with the obligatory signed photo. This place deserves to keep the authentic funkiness."}
{"text":"Overall, food was good. But I was hoping for something more exciting to my taste buds. The lady that served us was really friendly which made our experience pleasant. But the food didn't blow my mind. Ordered the Bulgogi burger, BLT burger, regular fries and chili cheese fries. It was all made fresh to order but I feel like the photos were more enticing than what we had in person."}
{"text":"MAN WHAT HAPPEND???? IT'S NOT THE BEST BURGER SPOT in Vegas anymore!  What happens to the election Nino burgers? So sad.. I decided to stay and eat.. I should of went with my first instinct and leave.. the food was NOT good. My pupusas were not filled with anything. I ordered friend bananas with beans n sour cream. The bananas were dryyy!! And like literally got a spoon of beans n sour cream. Huge disappointment.  Idk if it's the same owner but THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.. Bring back the Grill.. there to much competition and great food places to be cheap and serve not good food... BRING BACK THE BURGERS PLEASE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at Bripolis was worth the trip. I only stayed a little to try their cheesecake and fried dough w/powdered sugar desserts. The services are kindly decent within a comfortable environment. The atmosphere seems adequate; SPREAD THE WORD!!"}
{"text":"We just went, and this is the worst place to eat at.  We were really excited to go. And got terrible service and disgusting food!  We had ordered a Caesar salad and got an Asian salad, even after telling the server, she was still trying to convince us that was a Caesar salad.  Never knew a Caesar salad came with mandarins and peanut sauce.  And then she brought out garlic fries which we never ordered although waiting on Carne Asada fries we returned the garlic fries and a minute later she brings out the carne Asada fries and all they did was put the carne Asada toppings on top of the garlic fries!  They thought we wouldn't notice!  Well we did!  Horrible horrible!!! Also the grilled chicken burger was dry and disgusting!!!  I hope these people take this into consideration!! Ughhh im so disgusted  I had to go to Burger King after to eat something! That should let you know something!!"}
{"text":"This place is Legit!

I had the Guacamole Burger & it was full of flavor.
Bacon was crispy & greasy, just like I like it.
Also ordered the Buffalo chick w/ a side a ranch & it was huge.
Don't forget to order a mexican bottle coke!

One of the best spots in LV for a juicy burg."}
{"text":"I just had the best burger in my life!!!  This place is awesome and I can't wait to go back again.  We went around 3:30 in the afternoon and the place was empty which was surprising but still the burgers are delicious!!!  I had the bulgogi burger and it was so full of flavor.  Patty was the perfect size and u can get a dbl patty but I don't think I would have finished it.   The cashier/server was really nice and he even recommended the bulgogi burger to me which did not disappoint.  He even brought us some fresh chips and salsa which was sooo good I had to ask for seconds.  We also ordered some wings which where perfect and not all greasy like others and some cheese fries to top it off."}
{"text":"First time here. Came here for lunch around 1pm on a Friday. They offer a variety of food: burgers, tacos, pupusas, ceviche...There was only one other party of 2 eating and no one else walked in the whole time I was there. So I was surprised they took a while to bring out my 2 tacos & 2 pupusas. But anyway, good flavor & inexpensive. Place is clean, & friendly service. They brought out chips & salsa right away. They have a variety of bottled drinks, including their water so if you order it, you will be charged since you'll be getting a bottle & not a glass of water like other places. Really wanted to try their ensalada drink but they were out, bummer. Tip: they said they post 'secret menu' items on Instagram."}
{"text":"Really great spot for burgers. The burgers are really tasty and I loved the garlic fries. The owner (I think) means really well, but the service is SO slow. I'm fine with running next door to swipe cards, but I had to get up and ask for water several times (we're in a desert!). Maybe it's time to hire someone, it's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches.  Cali chicken is amazing.  Free chips  and salsa.  Home aid awesomeness.  Not surprising they have so many good reviews."}
{"text":"Great place, with super friendly service and delicious burgers at a super reasonable price.  Very fresh ingredients.  It definitely feels like a work in progress right now since they just opened, but I'll be back and I look forward to seeing what they do with the place."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times. Usually pretty good. I ordered 2 burgers today. 1 medium and 1 medium rare. Both were cooked the exact same with no pink. i had ordered to go and when i got to the car i looked at them. I took them back inside because i had extra onions when i didnt want any and due to improper cook on meat. The guy said it cooked more because it sat in the box. It only sat in the box for a few minutws and it should be cooked to factor that in. Angered I walked out. This place was great when it opened but seems to be struggling and going down hill."}
{"text":"I lived in this area at one time and could not find La Parilla when a friend suggested we eat there. It's tucked away in the first shopping center after Eastern on Flamingo.

I wasn't sure what to make of the place--Was it a Mexican food spot? Was it a burger joint? I stopped trying to put it in a box and have accepted that it is it's own creature. I can tell you this--it's definitely a fast food spot. 

What I get:
*lemon pepper chicken wings (pro tip: get them cooked extra crispy)
*carne asada tacos 

This is a small shop that puts out consistently good food.  They have a diverse menu (which generally concerns me; La Parilla gets it right) so there is something for everyone to try and enjoy.  I've been here plenty of times and have eaten my two trusty dishes more times than I can count. You might like the wild burger options or the Mexican sodas.  I can only say that I have never been disappointed. It's greasy fast food and they cook it well.  What more needs to be said?"}
{"text":"As a customer, I never leave reviews...But for this restaurant I just had to. I came to Vegas for the first time on a business trip. After being here every other week, I thought I'd never find a good restaurant. I have had such bad experiences in every aspect at EVERY restaurant and drive thru I have visited here. When I stepped into La Parilla, it was empty so I was a bit skeptical but it turned out to be the best experience I've had here! Thank you so much to Pamela for providing such amazing customer service experience! Food was delicious but I have to say Pamela's attentive customer service is what made me give this place five stars. And by the way don't forget to try the pupusas, they are bomb!"}
{"text":"If you're coming here to try the lab. Dont. Waitress didn't speak english. Was told they no longer make any of the dishes they post on the instagram. Really came here for one of those awesome milkshakes they post about. Guess what? Was told they don't have what I'm asking for. Even showed them the pictures on they're own instagram. This place is a dump. Will never be coming again"}
{"text":"The Best Preparadas I ever had! Highly Recommended! Burgers have a fresh bun and are juicy to perfection! The fries are seasoned and super delicious! The environment could be better but the food trumps that, and the great tasting food brings overall comfort!"}
{"text":"I don't think I would have ever thought of putting bulgogi and american cheese together to make a burger but I'm really glad these people did!  I wasn't crazy about paying almost eight bucks for a burger at first but I thought the novelty might make it worth a little extra and it did.  On top of that I never expected to get chips and salsa, pretty good chips and salsa at that, while I was waiting for my burger so this was a nice find.   Find is a good word for it too because it does not really stick out waaaayyyy back there in the little strip mall.  Friday nights are busy there but Saturdays seem to be okay."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite spots when i come to vegas! Best burgers for a great price! Try the el niño burger it soooo good!  The staff is super friendly and they have a very chill vibe....always a must when i come to vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible! The portions were huge, the food was fantastic and the service was awesome! We came in for a surprise birthday dinner for a friend. Not only did they put our cake in the back until after dinner, they brought it out with candles, dimmed the lighting and had Happy birthday played by the Dj for us. This place was an unexpected gem in a little shopping center. I'm so happy we found it and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Idk where to start,but i can definitely say that i enjoyed it from beginning to end. Let me begin by a good costumer service follow by a great menu.i started with a milkshake followed by a great yummy guacamole burger.and everything was delicious.the place seem to be under construction today and there's a minor down for the fact that there's some kind of church next door,however this place is great when it comes to food flavor.i strongly recommend it and of course i need to try the whole menu which am sure will be delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I found this place via yelp and the reviewers were spot on. 4.5 stars. Food was great especially the bulgogi burger, blt burger, American burger,  bbq wings, and parmesan fries. Owner and his mom are excellent people. Salsa and chips are warm and fresh...seriously fresh!  Hope this place does well. Worth driving off the strip for."}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers have said, get over the location. I ordered off their \"Secret Menu\" aka Instagram and had the Lemon Pepper Shrimp fries, my friend had the Steak Tacos. He really liked the taco, my fries where good except for being a little too salty. We both said that we would go again, next time I will try the burgers."}
{"text":"Seriously the guacamole burger is the bomb if you love avocado and a little citrus that is the thing to eat. Their establishment is a new but I see so much potential in it. I love that you order up front and they bring the food to you great customer service and you feel a chill vibe. Definitely ill be a regular their"}
{"text":"What a great find! I love that we have a place like this on the east side! Laid back atmosphere and unbelievable burgers with great twists and fusions! Everyone should come out to support this place!"}
{"text":"The onky reason i give a 3 is becauae it was hot in there no a/c half the stuff on their instagram is not on the menu. But food was delicious and fresh. Will recommed but will you get a menu with everything on it."}
{"text":"Dont give a lot of 5 stars out but this place lived up to the hype. The food , service, and price were better than expected. 

 Some people will say its not in the best of areas and im not sure what they mean by that? Its in a strip mall with other tenants and plenty of parking. Nothing more or less. 

Dont expect free chips and salsa as i didnt get that nor really wanted it. 

I will be back much more as its a small business near me ."}
{"text":"A hidden jewel in the wall. This place has amazing burgers. If you like Bachi burger you will like this place as much or better. 
Unique Burger w amazing flavor. A pleasure to your palate. Will come back!!! This place needs to be kept open! We got the bulgogi burger and the A1 w an egg! Awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. . Delicious burgers and wings! Family run. . Great food and wonderful for groups!"}
{"text":"It just wasn't good. I ordered to-go and my food wasn't ready when I came 15 minutes later. It took them 10 more minutes to get my food out. 

Upon entering, there was a unique smell in the restaurant. That smell hinted in my burger. Plus, my patty was overcooked. The food was nothing special. The service was crap. They seemed overwhelmed that they actually had a large party and made me feel neglected. All in all, I really only give one star if the food was terrible. And it was."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. The bugogi burger was so juicy and delicious and my husband had the cheesesteak burger and we both devoured them. This is definitely a hidden gem and we will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The burgers are amazing! The service was great. The prices are very affordable for what you get. If you want a great lunch, check this place out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a quick takeout  lunch. I wasn't in the mood for a burger and ordered their 10 pc chicken wings instead for $8.99. I requested half garlic parmesan and the other half as lemon pepper.

As I waited for my order, I looked around the dining area and was pleasantly surprised how this place got a new facelift both in and out since my last visit. The dining area is huge with lots of roomy places to move around. Then I noticed they don't have the option for fountain soda, but have good selections of drinks in the fridge. I like my drinks with ice. So to me it was a downfall.

After 10 minutes, my chicken wings were freshly made, piping hot with a ranch dipping sauce. The wings, to me, seem bigger here than other places. They were crispy and cooked perfectly! But darn it! I just realized the great garlic aroma from the garlic parm (hence the name) and taste were MIA! What I also didn't like about the parmesan cheese used, it was grainy or kinda pasty (can't quite describe it) for me to eat. It definitely lacked that robust flavor from the garlic. 

On the other hand, the lemon pepper wings were good but needed more tartness from the lemon powder. These would have been awesome chicken wings if better quality seasonings were used. The ranch dressing can also be replaced with a better quality. It's effortless to make one from scratch versus premade. This would have been a winning combination!

As usual, the staff here was wonderful and friendly! It's located in a small plaza on East Flamingo between Eastern and Eucalyptus Avenue."}
{"text":"They changed this restaurant. It's now a Guatemalan food joint. There are no more exotic burgers, the tacos/burritos aren't good anymore and the drink prices are higher ($3.50 for a half litre coca-cola). 

I had a burrito and some tacos. I didn't like the burrito. It had lettuce, beans, peas and carrots in it. I don't fancy the peas/carrots in a burrito. Aside from that, the asada tasted good.. That's all I really liked. 

As for the environment, music was way too loud. I don't mind music, but jeeze, it isn't a nightclub. 

Maybe I'm being hard on the place because I loved the old restaurant and old owners/management. Turn the music down, and try removing the lettuce/peas/carrots from the burrito."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch because of the yelp reviews. Place was surprisingly empty even though the reviews have been great. Place was clean and the staff was friendly. The prices were OK, not too expensive but not cheap either. I got the bulgogi with a soda and it came out to be a little over 10 bucks.

The burger: 
Buns were a little dry but serviceable, would have loved to see them butter it a tiny bit. Bulgogi was very tender If not a tiny bit salty. The patty itself was slightly over medium but still flavorful and not dry. Overall it was a good burger, didn't blow my socks off but still a good gourmetish burger with interesting toppings. Will have to try some of their other interesting offerings. 

Side note, they give you chips and salsa while you wait and some Ice cream after your meal! All for free, so it definitely increases your value. 

All in all a solid burger joint, the toppings make it better than average. Recommend it for lunch if you're close by!"}
{"text":"Thought this would be an enjoyable experience but sadly I was wrong. I won't be back. 

Location - situated in small shopping area near Flamingo and Eastern. Parking decent with plenty of spaces. Not sure how I would feel about this neighborhood at night. 

Restaurant - spacious, but boy of boy was the smell of cleaning products extremely potent! And not in a good way!! We could smell it as we approached the restaurant. I feel the smell even permeated on our meals, ugh! Big turn off! Pretty much the reason I won't be back. 

Food - I don't remember what my coworker ordered, but I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and Garlic Parmesan fries. Both were good portions, but again, I feel like the smell of the cleaning products seriously transferred on my food I could only stomach half of my sandwich. They came out with chips and salsa as a starter which was pretty tasty. So for my sandwich, fries, and bottled water I believe I paid roughly $16-17. I don't even know how much they charged for bottled water, since they didn't print us a receipt, but I'm guessing around $2.00. 

Service - Friendly, but slow and it wasn't even a busy lunch hour :(

I won't be back for reasons listed above and I don't think I'll be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at the lab and it's still delicious. I've had the guacamole burger and now the A1 burger and they're both totally delicious. I also had the cinnamon toast milk shake and yum!!! The staff seem really passionate about the food and it shows. I'm so glad I found this place though Yelp go eat some yummy burgers!!!"}
{"text":"If you love hamburgers this is the best in town! Top quality ingredients and the burger is delicious. Fries are large and seasoned well. Highly recommend if you are looking for a 5 star burger in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for months, but live way on the other side of town. Recently had the opportunity to hit this place for dinner and was a little underwhelmed. Service is polite, location is pretty basic and bare-bones and menu is exciting but didn't quite deliver.

BULGOGI BURGER: Good choice. Thick, hearty burger patty with flavorful 'gogi for a pleasant combination of flavors. The American cheese was an odd pairing but somehow, it worked.

CHEESESTEAK BURGER: Swimming in cheese, I thought I would love this. The mushrooms, onions, and pepper mixture was a little on the bland side but combined with the cheese sauce it was tasty. But the mixture somehow just didn't combine with the burger component. It felt like two separate dishes on one plate. 

GARLIC PARMESAN FRIES: Large portion, lots of parm, but no garlic. Really bummed, since I miss garlic fries from living in the Bay area where they're  all over the place. I'm also not a huge fan of skinny-cut fries but mostly I was just underwhelmed by the lack of garlic.

I'd stop by this place again, and I would try another few of their burgers. Signage outside indicates that they also sell some Mexican foods which I thought was a little odd and may be overreaching, but staff was Hispanic which may explain why they added those particular dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best burger in town! Parm fries are excellent, and burgers big n juicy. Go here!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hispanic type food, Excellent friendly service!!  If you get tired of food on strip this restaurant well worth short car ride. Portions are very generous:-)

Visiting from DFW area!!"}
{"text":"Went for the burgers and they lived up to the hype. Toppings were great, but the meat could have been a little more flavorful and juicy. I think I liked the chili cheese fries and big ass Mexican cokes the best."}
{"text":"Looking for some quick & cheap dinner I went to the burger lab for the first time. Didn't know what to expect  but the owner was really friendly and the service was great. While I was waiting for my food he fried me up some fresh chips with salsa which were really good. 

I got the cheesesteak burger for my sandwich.  It was covered with sautéed onions, peppers and cheezewhiz. Pretty freakin good burger. I will definitely be coming back here with friends.  They also offered me free scoop of ice cream too which was pretty generous. Overall just really attentive service and good food"}
{"text":"They have a really wide variety of food and everything that we've tried so far is amazing. Their menu only has burgers and some other things but they make everything like tacos, pupusas, burritos, shakes, wings, so many other things I can't even name them all. You really have to look through their instagram (@theburgerlab) to get an idea of everything they can make. I usually pick something from their instagram and just show them and ask them to make that. Everything I've tried is pretty good. I especially love the carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"The rating is at a 3 due to the building..,, i would NEVER actually eat there.... the smell of the place is terrible and the cook staff and the front desk girl were yelling and fighting with each other through the window for all to hear....

The food though was wonderful.. but i took mine home... there would be no way that i would have been able to eat it there with that terrible smell in the place!

building bad... food good!!!!1"}
{"text":"Well, there is no question that the food is good. But the service is slow and unorganized. For being one of only three people in the store, it took about 10 long minutes to get my food. But based on my observation, it seems that the two guys working here are the owners as well who just began their operations in this business.

They seem relatively new and still kinda conforming into managing this place. Nevertheless, I see potential since the food is pretty good. But there is still a lot of organization to improve on."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 asada pupusas which were good but were really greasy. The cortido tasted just ok and the red sauce they give you tastes just like tomato sauce (yuck!). Expect to wait a while for your order too. I asked about the hot plantain drink and the woman said she didn't have any which is weird because plantain is on a few items on the menu. They don't make burgers and shakes here anymore it's just Salvadoran and Mexican food now. I also used my debit card and she charged me $1 even though it said there was a 50¢ charge for debit cards on the cash register. Hmmm... So needless to say I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"LOVE this place BUT I do wish they would create a kid's menu.  They should also invest in a soda machine and carry iced tea.  I ordered a coffee shake but our waitress said that there was no coffee available.  Disappointing, knowing that I'm sure they have coffee available for their breakfast customers.  Overall though the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Summerlin to the Eastside just to try this (seen from Instagram) on our Fat Kid Thursday adventures (yes, on a Thursday). The owners were super nice and kept tabs on how we were doing. The place seems small from the outside but spacious in the inside. 

Food was just simply amazing! 

Everyone in the group got burgers, but man... those papusas were just calling out to me!  I looooove their twist on the pickled cabbage. One ordered the El Nino, which is a burger in the middle of two papusas and that tasted heavenly!  two ordered your typical burgers, but still tasted amazing according to them. Then we also ordered garlic parmesian, chili fries, and gravy fries. (Love the garlic parm fries!) 

As for Drinks, I ordered the jamaica which tasted fresh. Another ordered the Ensalada with their own spin of pineapple with cilantro and guava, but that was sooooooooooooooh delicious!  

Mind you, we had to take leftovers home... we were that full. 

We're planning on making another trip again, just to explore that entire menu. Also, if you like these guys... add them on Instagram @theburgerlab - they will give you a shoutout! Plus they can create burgers that's not on the menu, but posted on instagram if you're feeling a little frisky that day"}
{"text":"This place is spacious!! Guys here are great. Gravy fries are bomb. Guacamole burger was filled with deliciousness. Pretty sure all their burgers are great. Service was pretty fast. We only waited a couple minutes. Probably be here often, since I work by the area. Getting tired of Subway, and Carls Jr."}
{"text":"This place wasn't what I expected.  First I had trouble finding it BC the sign was taken down in front of the store.  Had high hopes from other yelpers.  When I got there the smell was off putting it smelled like dirty stale water.  

The food came out and it looked nice but when u took a bite the burger was overlooked and very salty  I had the bacon cheese burger with a garlic aioli   There was garlic aioli on both sides of the bread. Was too much.  The cheese fries were not that hot.  Yelpers might have gotten this one wrong. BC I have had my share of burgers and I wouldn't go back to get a burger from this place.  

The lady employee was really nice. That was the only bright spot."}
{"text":"After showing James O. some of the food pics for this spot, he insisted we go the next day for dinner. But as he didn't get off work until almost closing time, we ran over here for takeout instead of dining in.

We opted for sharing the cheesesteak burger and the carne asada fries. Surprisingly, the food traveled well and was still warm when we got it home (which was not exactly close).

The carne asada fries were seriously delicious. I. Could. Not. Stop. Eating. Them. So tasty! And they definitely don't skimp on the toppings here. You couldn't even see the fries for all the toppings. The meat was perfect - tender and full of tastiness.

The cheesesteak burger was good, but it didn't blow me away. I loved all the toppings and that it did, in fact, kinda taste like a cheesesteak. It was a neat and different way to enjoy a burger. The burger could've been a little less cooked and little better seasoned. But it was yummy enough. Good quality ingredients.

We will most definitely be coming back and trying more burgers and fries. TIP: We were informed that they have Instagram account which features some of their \"secret menu\" options."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this place has one of the best burgers I've had in Las Vegas.  It's totally a little joint & the interior needs a bit of work but it's clean, which is what matters the most to me.  

They only serve burgers with the normal accoutrements but you won't need or want anything else.  My burger was perfectly seasoned & cooked exactly the way I asked for it.  The fries were delicious.  The cashier/chef was super friendly and attentive even though he was the only one working.  They seriously need to open another location where they can get more people in - Burger Lab is a hidden gem!  It was worth every bit of cholesterol!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna say that I like this place. I was driving by and I saw this hole in the wall joint and I had to try it. This seems to be a Mexican restaurant that also specializes in creative burgers. They do serve breakfast items in the morning as well. 
Today I tried the Bulgogi Burger with egg and garlic parmesan fries for my side. I'm gonna bet that no Korean person will ever tell you that this actually tastes like Bulgogi, but nevertheless, it was different and I thought it tasted pretty good. The egg was a nice addition. The fries were a bit too salty for my liking but that could be just me. There are no fountain drinks here so you'll have to get your drinks by the can. Also, they give you nachos and salsa while you wait. After everything including tip, I spent about $16 here. Overall I was stuffed by the time I was finished and I thought it was a decent value for your money.
Food came out fast and my server was very nice. He also told me that there is a secret/variable menu that can only be seen on Instagram so I'm following them now. This place is a bit out of the way for me, but if I'm in the area I'll try it again for sure."}
{"text":"Have been following them on IG since October 2015 and just went there this month. I'm in love with the Cajun Shrimp Salad Fries, I've had it 3 times already. I want to try the Cajun Shrimp Quesadillas and Oreo Shake next."}
{"text":"Wow very very good burgers great taste and amazing flavor me and my friends order to pick up for lunch an order american chesse burguer, bulgogi burguer, crispy chiken burguer and carne asada fries awesome food keep great job always"}
{"text":"I have followed this joint on Instagram for a while now and was in the area. The place was clean at first glance. The gentleman taking our order brought us complimentary chips and salsa which was sort of a ceviche based sauce and it was good. We bother ordered BLT burgers and 1 order of bacon cheese fries. The burger was on point, the bread was hearty enough not to get soggy and the meat was very good. The cheese bacon fried were very good also, it was a mix of nacho and shredded cheddar cheese. Overall the food was great and came out just like my Instagram account portrayed it. I would recommend his place for burgers to anyone who likes good burgers.

{"text":"I decided to try after seeing great reviews on Yelp.  This place just opened about a week and a half ago from today I found out.  The burgers are fresh, well-crafted and delicious.  The menu is unique and has a variety of different kinds of burgers, something for everyone.  Living in Vegas, there are not many burger places that are not a chain burger place so this is a great local find."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! We order everything from the secret menu not thinking about the price but the menu items were priced so well! Never being informed the cost- we go to pay as we leave and our bill is over $60 for 2 people. Makes you reconsider how good the food was at that price. We could have ate at Katsuya 3 course meal for the same price. They definitely should inform first timers not only of the secret menu but advise of the pricing. Overall good experience but it was a lowball move by not telling us the cost. Even the cashier looked on edge to tell us the price bc he probably expected backlash but we are more civilized than that- we vent thru yelp like other people haha 

The food is fire tho!! Can't lie- just let me know what I'm paying. We didn't even see a receipt itemized. Haha

Our order

Blue lagoon surfer burger
Guacamole burger
Cajun shrimp fried
2 beers
Total $61.03"}
{"text":"The Bulgolgi burger was delicious! The chips and salsa before the meal is a nice addition. Plus ice cream after. A great meal for the price. I would definitely come back. And my boyfriend loved his American burger"}
{"text":"The food and the service was great. A good kick it spot for friends and family. Plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Came to check out this place because we've been seeing such great reviews on them on Instagram and social media. 

As soon as we came inside we were greeted by a gentleman. This place has that at home feeling in which makes you feel comfortable. 

I ordered the bulgogy burger with bacon and thousand island and my boyfriend had the El Niño burger (had 2 pupusas as buns) with double stacked meat and a side of garlic Parmesan fries. This was enough for the both of us. The guy who helped us named Ivan was very nice and explained everything on the menu & even suggested some other things and said they also have a secret menu. 

Overall, for our first time here, it was such a great experience and we are definitely coming back. Their food was so good, even had some left overs to take home!"}
{"text":"Great good and great service. The portions are hugeeeeee, so I'd say get something to share with someone, but other than that this place is great!"}
{"text":"I wanna say this was the best burger I've had in Vegas. I had the bulgogi burger and garlic parmesan fries and it was amazing. I wanted to take a picture because it looked so good but I couldn't stop eating it."}
{"text":"It's no secret among my friends that I am huge fan of The Burger Lab!!  Not only is it close to our East Side casa - it is the best quality.  Super casual dining atmosphere - walk up - place order- they bring lovely salsa and fresh chips while you wait.  The burgers are SO perfect - fresh grilled meat and toppings.  They have specialty burgers that I have yet to try but I can't get away from ordering my same American burger each time.  The fries are off the hook and they have a few topping options including classic cheese sauce.  The only problem at this spot is there are not enough people eating here!"}
{"text":"I'd always prefer to spend my money and support local businesses so the negative rant can (and should) be discarded;
I ordered the regular burger (American) and the Garlic & parm fries. I waited a little over 20 minutes for the food. The fries are just frozen fries with parmigian cheese and garlic powder and the burger was pretty good. 
The soda fountain is out of order so canned soda it was. 
It was 110 degrees outside and 108 degrees inside. 
Now the reason I disregard the negative points mentioned above is because the owner (or I think it is) is taking orders and cooking with the help of his mom (or I think she is) and serving the food. So as an ex entrepreneur I can understand when times are tough why there is no soda fountain (syrop is expensive and you have minimums to order) and why the AC is on \"energy saving mode\" and when you cant afford employees you do it all. 
As I type this review the owner/server/cook came up to me and ofered complimentary ice cream. I thought it was because he caught me writing on Yelp and wanted to make an impression for a good review. Lol. But I saw him asking every table. 
Over all the service, though slow, was very good and the food is not bad at all. Its fresh and the place is very clean. 
The only thing that bugged me the most was the stripper wanna-be who sat behind me with her boy and had the most obnoxious perfume on her. I lost my sense of smell for a week. 

In support for our local businesses I will come back and recommend you go try it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The burgers here are very delicious! The customer service was lacking when I went and the location is a bit iffy but the food is worth picking up. Not the cheapest but for this kind of burger it's a good deal. The fries were nothing special in my opinion."}
{"text":"Follow them on instagram. Had to try their burgers because the make it look so good on their pictures. Great burger. But they can use a better bun."}
{"text":"Legit spot!!! In a little strip mall not busy but the food was bomb. I got the BLT burger fantastic- my wife got the Bolgoria burger or what ever the best sellers called. So good!! Recommend-"}
{"text":"It saddens me to give this place two stars, but if I gave it more, I would be a liar. I had been dying to try La Parilla. Its seemed right up my alley, gourmet burgers, street tacos, a secret menu, and coke from Mexico! Well, what a disappointment! Being a mom and pop shop, I hate having to give them negative feedback, but please, let me explain. 
First I will mention the good. The beans, the shakes with churros, and the carne asada. 
Yep, that's all. The beans were homemade and flavorful. The shakes are like no other! Made with real ice cream and interesting toppers that really catch the eye, and fill the stomach. And the meat on the carne asada taco was excellent. 
I can NOT say as much for the pork, or chicken. Both of those tacos were simply average and nothing to brag about. The burgers, decent. Nothing gourmet. And why did the A-1 burger, not come with A-1? Hmmm? The wings, same, average. 
So if everything was average, why only 2 stars? 
Well, they were out of the amazing milkshakes, which still is not the ONLY reason. My boyfriend asked for rootbeer, they told us they didn't have any. Meanwhile, Barq's rootbeer is clearly in the cooler, in plain site. If that still does not justify my 2 stars, then we seen a roach, in the kitchen. THEN, after giving them the benefit of the doubt that bugs happen, and it's getting warm outside, a roach crawled across the booth, to where my daughter had to literally jump over it. She totally lost her appetite, to be honest, we all did. 
Now, the staff was accommodating, and did not charge us for our less-than-half eaten meals. We still left him a tip, but unless they get a system going, I don't see this place lasting very long.
Maybe it's the building, as many restaurants have failed here. I would love to see them make it happen here, regardless of my bad experience."}
{"text":"Easily 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this burger place.  The space is big and they have plenty of tables and chairs. The guys who work there are very nice and it looks like they enjoy what they are doing, its good to know they have a passion for what they are cooking for you! The price wasn't too bad either, it wasn't expensive but it wasn't on the cheap side either. 

 The menu was simple, but it did have a lot of variety. They have chicken burger options and a vegetarian option. They also have salads. Different flavors of fires too! When I went there they were installing a soda fountain. They had some cold drinks available though.

I tried the bulgogi burger and my boyfriend tried the cali chick burger, if I can recall. We received french fries and onion rings. The only thing reason why it wasn't 5 stars was because he miss heard our order. We thought we ordered garlic parm, but we got regular instead. So that was disappointing. Other than that, the burgers were delicious. They were cooked perfectly and they were huge burgers. I was very pleased with the taste of the bulgogi. My burger had the right amount of toppings and it wasn't overwhelming. I could still taste the beef. My boyfriend really liked his cali chick burger with the huge chicken breast and avocado inside. He liked the flavor a lot. I would definitely come back for their burgers. My mouth is already watering.. Hah. This burger place has so much potential. I would check it out!"}
{"text":"We have always loved coming to The Burger Lab. Their food is unique and tastes amazing. Its also a family ran establishment which Ive always preferred over chains. Great food, easy to find and great service!"}
{"text":"Just came in on a Wednesday night, craving for some big ass burgers that we saw on their Instagram account. Gosh everything was so delicious! I can't blame the service cause the guy was pretty nice to us. The burgers were pretty big and we didn't really eat the entire portion. But hey, at least we got something to eat later at night right? Lol. 

Note: eating here is a little bit pricey.. Especially to the ones that you see on their Instagram posts.. Like The Surf N Turf, the price was ridiculous. $18 but it was bomb. 

Wish they weren't that pricey though.. The experience was pretty cool and all, but we're not coming back again. Spent $50 just for one time eating at a restau. That's not hella cheap."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. I've had the Guacamole burger, the Pastrami Burger and the Philly Cheese Steak burger! My only criticism? I can't choose which one is the best! 
The Guacamole and Pastrami were certainly a manwich! They are all fresh and delicious. The Philly was so cheesy I had to wipe my mustache after each bite because it would be full of cheese! 

In a supposed world class town service is often lacking. Here, it's like you're family... in a good loving family... not the kind you see on Jerry Springer. 

I've taken two different people and they love it as well. It's worth the short trip from anywhere in Vegas to try this place!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers
Had the A1 with egg (heavy meal though)
American burger
Chili cheese fries
Asada taco
Oreo shake

Only thing that wasn't that good was the taco.

Very friendly service but they might be slightly understaffed because

Not too far from the strip but don't miss the parking entrance or you'll go around a large block.

Same parking lot as Magoos"}
{"text":"First, this place is on the eastside, in what always looks like a deserted shopping center every time I've been.  Get over it.

The burgers here have been good everytime we've been.  You also need to check their Instagram (@theburgerlab) for their off-menu items.  I've had the Guacamole Burger, and the El Nino, and the Shrimp Fries here.  All were delicious.  If anything, I'd say that you should split a burger and fries with someone, otherwise expect take out. (I'm not one of those people, big servings = me happy).

The waitstaff is always super nice and friendly, and that can't help but add to the charm of the place.

They also have coke with real sugar!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers around Las Vegas. Must try!! Great food great service!! Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"The El Niño has aaaaamazing!!! I wasn't sure what to expect because I'm a hard core pupusa fan, but the burger patty itself was seasoned so perfectly that the burger itself melted in your mouth. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the cheesesteak burger protein style with no cheese and loved it. Would've love to have it regular but still was very good. Place is unassuming, but don't let that full you. Their burgers pack a punch."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint!

Ever since I saw the picture of the Bulgogi Burger I couldn't wait to try it. It just so happens I was just down the street from there so it's got to be destiny right? Located off of East Flamingo with Eastern being the main cross street, look for this place where McGoo's is just right off the street.

As I walk in I couldn't help but notice just how spacious the interior was so not enough seating was not gonna be an issue. If you refer to my pic, you could probably throw in some more tables and chairs if you wanted to.

So I order the Bulgogi Burger (7.75) and accompanied it with Garlic Parmesan Fries (2.99). I already had bottled water with me so no need to get a drink. My total came out to 11 bucks and some change. Not really what I wanted to spend for lunch but my excuse was that it was a new place so prices the first time around usually don't scare me away unless the food and/or service is really bad.

Ok so the Bulgogi Burger looks as good as the picture. You get a 1/3 pound angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and bulgogi beef to top it off on a decent bun. From the looks and taste of it, it looks like they season their beef while it is cooking. I asked them how the usually cook their patties and the guy said medium by default unless otherwise requested. The saltiness of the marinated beef was a good compliment to the beef patty. This burger does not come with ketchup or mustard but on every table there are ketchup and mustard bottles. If you want sriracha, tabasco, or A1 steak sauce, it is on their counter. Not sure if all their burgers don't come with sauces as a standard so I guess I will find out next time.

The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good. They make sure to coat each individual fry with grated parmesan cheese and garlic powder. I enjoyed it very much. My Yelp buddy Shawn H got the Chili Cheese Fries and man it looked good. Definitely refer to the pic he posted.

Service was pleasant from start to end. They greeted me as I walked in, took my order, and brought it out in a timely manner. They even asked me if I needed anything as they were cleaning up other tables beside me.

From their menu you can see that they have other items like wings, salad, and extras to add on to your burger. I think next time I will try their wings. I think its like 8 pieces for 9 bucks and you can add fries for an extra dollar.

So all in all my first experience was pleasant. They havnt had a grand opening yet so hopefully that is in the works. Maybe they can have some kind of lunch special so you don't go over 10 bucks for a burger, fries, and drink combo? That would be sweet. I would consider this a gourmet type of place. 4 stars for the first experience. We will see how it holds up the second time around down the road sometime.

{"text":"I had high hopes for this place from reading the reviews... Unfortunately it was not good. I ordered the guacamole burger w fries. The bun was stale n the burger was difficult and messy to eat. There was an unnecessary amount of chipotle mayo which made it harder to eat. Yuckkkkk who the hell wants an half a bottle of mayo on a burger!?!?!!! The fries were also stale n old n gross. Needless to say I think carls jr would've been the better option."}
{"text":"I was on my lunch break looking for something new to try and bam I came across this place.  There were so many options to choose from and everything looked good!  I choose the A1 burger, boy let me tell you that burger was huge! Most importantly it was delicious! That patty was thick and the fries were crisp and fresh! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here for the good rating on Yelp and the pics of amazing looking burgers and shakes and to my disappointment the burger was made with a tough and fatty ground beef and lacked seasoning. Then, after our subpar meal I was hoping to have an awesome shake to make up for the meal and instead they said they didn't have any, but yet it was still on the menu. My fiance said the wings were cooked good, although small and were out of the sauce he originally wanted. The best thing we had here was the steak and cheese pupusas, but nothing to rave about. I was happy to have a decent pupusa, but it is a far cry from a good burger and shake place. They do not even have fountain soda drinks, one can of soda was almost $2 and a bottled soda was almost $3!. We will not return. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in town with the best prices.

They have a \"secret\" menu on Instagram. Half the stuff on IG is not on the menu. But basically you just show them a picture on IG and they'll make it for you, even tweak it for you if you wanted to add or subtract items. 

I got the Avocado burger with egg. It was literally bigger than me. Like I am a very neat eater, I don't like to get dirty. But beware, if you're like me, you will get as messy as hell! I did not know how to eat it at first because it was so gigantic. And for about 8$ it was definitely much worth it! My boyfriend got the Bulgogi burger with an extra patty and that was even more massive! 

Also they have the best shakes I ever had. It is literally heaven on earth. We got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch shake and it was so good. I really really wanted to get the tiramisu shake but they ran out of tiramisu. That was the only disappointing thing about our meal. 

They also have Mexican food that I hear is pretty damn good. So next visit that is what I will be trying out. 

Now once you arrive it's in a pretty awkward place. It's usually deserted and not in the best side of town but really it is worth it. Do not judge a book by its cover.

The guy that helped us was awesome, very helpful and informative. He mans the IG account and post the best pictures of the food. 
 
Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We decided to check out La Parilla The Lab on a Wednesday night. Instantly we were greeted and told about all of the great choices on the menu. Breakfast, wings...etc. We decided on the Guac Burger and the Bulgogi Beef Burger. Both took time to prepare but worth the wait. When they came out I could not believe the portion size! This is a restaurant style BIG burger. I took a bite and instantly felt very secure about my choice. The Guac Burger was moist and flavorful. There was a tv on showing the nightly news. The place felt like a great place to relax and enjoy a meal after work. We left feeling full and happy! I'll have to come back and try the wings and possibly breakfast one day. Only thing I wish they had was fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Well the burger was incredible! I had the BLT burger! This place knows how to satisfy a big hungry man. My husband had the Phili Steak burger. Wow what a satifying burger! I also had bacon fries. It was ok. The bacon was fresh but the fries were a lil soggy. In all I am very happy well be back! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Really good food and many choices. My hamburger is called the sad burger cause it only has cheese and tomato but it is really good. They have real ranch! Wings are good better than any wing place around"}
{"text":"Amazing place to come! Awesome staff and environment! There menu has a big variety of different things to choose from. Most definitely going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"First, how to find them: they are tucked into the back of the small strip mall with Magoo's Bar heading east on Flamingo before Eucalyptus Street. Second: the food is as good as it looks in the pictures. Why 3 stars? The service was really off that day.

I'm always crawling Yelp's pages for new places to eat lunch. We stopped by La Parilla for lunch after finding some great reviews. Our experience was a bit uneven. The Lab is a place that serves bar food, specialty hamburgers, with a mix of Mexican and Salvadorenan(?) items. I checked them out with the Health district and saw that they had a line of \"A\" grades, kudos to them. We decided to give them a try for lunch.

The Good: They have a really creative selection of burgers and a nice variety of food on the menu. The kitchen looked clean and the restaurant was neat. The food is great it looks just like the pictures on Yelp. It is a bit greasy, but I don't regularly eat fried foods. They give you a complimentary bowl of chips (homemade) and salsa while you wait for your order. 

The Bad: We couldn't eat in and get back to work in an hour. The nice man who helped us at the counter wasn't very experienced on the cash register and the line went slowly. Halfway through our order, someone came in from outside and completed punching it in so that our original server could help out in the kitchen. All the while, the new guy was chewing gum like a cow chews its cud. I'm not kidding, you could sometimes see the gum in his mouth, it was pink, disgusting. The kitchen was backed up and there was a mix-up with our tickets and we got our food long after people who ordered after us got theirs. The server was very apologetic, I felt bad for him, he needed some help. Also, they need a new take out menu. The one that they have is hard to read because the type is too small.

I think that people will really like their food, but I hope that what I observed will spur La Parilla The Lab to make some changes to tighten up their front/back of house organization. I encourage you to try them, but you might want to phone in your order to make sure it's ready and can be eaten during your lunch hour."}
{"text":"Local family owned burger diner. Interior isn't so bad and very clean! The food is very rich but yummy. The prices match the quality. Free chips and salsa. Our bill was $30 for two large sized burgers, fries, Snapple, New Castle, and a churro with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Nice local affordable diner."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers and Fries.  Found them on Instagram and they were happy to make me a burger off of there that wasn't on the normal menu.  Kind've an interesting restaurant space but the food is off the hook.  Not somewhere you want to eat all the time but when you are looking to be gluttons this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. My BF and I shared the BLT Burger, Carne Asada Taco and Cajun Shrimp Fries. Thankfully the server told us to check out Instagram for secret menu items and let me tell you it was worth it. The burger was juicy and bacon was cooked perfectly. The garlic aioli on the burger complimented it amazingly well. The carne asada taco was really good too, I'm from California and I'm a snob about tacos, but loved this one. Finally, the Cajun shrimp fries (secret menu) were delicious! I couldn't tell you everything that was on them but they are worth getting. I thought the service was good too. Will be going back here often."}
{"text":"I was looking for a burger joint near my apartment the other day and I came across this newly opened burger lab.  So I told my wife about it and we decided to try it out.   The burgers looked amazing from some of the reviews, so I was definitely curious! Guy at the counter seems very friendly.  I ordered the 1UP burger but with an extra hamburger patty, since the 1UP is a vegie burger.  But don't knock their quasi patty that's actually a giant mushroom. YES, it was delicious! oooey goooey goodness.  It was a bit messy to eat, but it was very good.  I'm not a big burger fan, but I am now a fan of the 1UP!  

My wife ordered the Cheezsteak.  She said it was a bit salty, so they might want to put something in there that balances the saltiness of the cheese.  We also ordered the garlic fries! That also didn't disappoint.  All in all, my only complaint is, when we went there, it was REALLY hot in the joint, I think only one AC vent was open and that was the one by the door.  We ended up not eating in and just getting our food to go.  

Guy at the counter did offer us some ice cream before we headed out, which was very nice of him. He also mentioned that they are going to be expanding the menu to include other great foods.  Oh, and they give you some fresh made chips and salsa while you wait, which is always a plus!! All in all, great new neighborhood burger joint.  Can't wait to try the chicken wings next time.  I'll update next time I go! I hope this place really flourish. :-)"}
{"text":"I had been following this place on Instagram and they post some really good looking stuff so I decided to give it a try when I went to vegas. 

The employees are nice, the atmosphere is average, nothing special. The food looks really good, but the taste doesn't match the looks. 
I got a surf and turf burrito, took two bites, and the rest ended up in the trash. Ive had plenty surf and turf burritos before, but never one that tasted like that. Their buffalo wings were really good though, I'd recommend them!

As far as going back, I can't see that happening, but I'm happy I atleast got to give it a try."}
{"text":"Could of been 5 but AC was not working well. Service on point and the food was so imaginatively delicious. The menu has me coming back for more because of its crazy mixups I could only dream of. I never though I'd see pupusas, tacos, asada fries, and burgers under one roof. Being Salvadorean I also appreciated their Ensalada drink packed with fruit!! New place for hangover or if I can't make my mind up for sure!"}
{"text":"I used to go to The Lab fairly regularly and raved about their burgers (I always got the Bulgogi Burger). I hadn't been in awhile but decided to order takeout after revisiting their Instagram page. I ordered the 1 Up burger with onion rings and my boyfriend got the crispy chick with garlic parmesan fries. Immediately after opening the takeout container I had to transfer the burger to a plate because the bottom bun was already soaked. I need to really remember to never have tomatoes on a burger because it gets so soggy. I'm also not a fan of mixing hot and cold vegetables. This burger had grilled onions, lettuce and tomatoes and taking a bite led to the whole thing slipping out the back and me eating mayonnaise bread. The grilled mushroom tasted dirty, with really no flavor. Maybe that's what I get for ordering a vegetarian burger. The onion rings weren't anything special. However, the crispy chick was hearty and was a lot better flavor wise. The garlic Parmesan fries were great, though the portion seemed smaller than I remember. 

The real winner here was the strawberry cheesecake milkshake we ordered. The last time we got this they actually stuck a slice of cheesecake inside the cup. This time it was more broken up, which was easier to consume. I would say this is one of the best milkshakes I've ever had but unfortunately it's not enough to give The Lab more than 3 stars right now. I think giving it another chance dining in would help but I don't crave burgers often enough for that to happen anytime soon probably."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and I love it! I don't eat meat so I order the 1 up burger which is mushroom in place of the burger and they sauté it with lots of veggies, it's delicious. My boyfriend usually orders the A1 burger and he says the same."}
{"text":"While I can't remember how long it's been since they opened, I know I've had The Burger Lab bookmarked for quite some time. It looks like they've expanded their menu a bit since opening though, and not only offer a decent selection of burgers, but also quite a few breakfast and lunch options, many of which are Mexican inspired dishes. They also have couple dessert options, a number of bottled drinks (sorry, no fountains here) and even \"exotic\" teas and fresh coffee. If you're coming with a group, there shouldn't be a problem finding something for everyone.

Now, the location itself is tucked away in the back of a small shopping center on Flamingo, just east of Eastern. It's a huge place that occupies two spaces in the building, only half of which has seating though. One of my biggest complaints was the temperature of the restaurant. We visited at the end of December and either the heater was broken, or they wanted the AC on and it was on the verge of freezing in the place. So cold that most of our food was quickly losing its temperature not long after getting it. 

I ended up ordering the El Niño, which is what I would say is more like a fusion burger. Topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella and pickled cabbage, this burger is sandwiched between two pupusas that are made in house. It doesn't appear that you're able to request meat temperature, or I just wasn't asked, but mine came out decent and was about mid to mid-rare. This burger is really interesting texturally. The soft pupusas and tender burger patty worked really well with the thick cuts of crunchy carrot in the pickled cabbage, and the gooey melted mozzarella was an excellent topping. My burger came with pupusas that were filled will refried beans, and because it's also nearly drowning in tomato sauce, it might be more of a knife & fork dish for some. Unless you're feeling adventurous and don't mind getting messy of course. But it was pretty tasty and something I've never really seen anywhere else.

We also put in an order of wings that came highly recommended by the guy at the counter. Even though we ordered them well done, they were cold to the touch by the time I finished my burger and were hard to eat. The sauce seemed decent, I just don't think I got the full flavor and was really bummed the temperature inside the restaurant affected the food so quickly. 

As far as pricing goes, it's not bad, but the a la carte style menu could easily get pricy. Every burger on the menu is just shy of $8, besides their standard \"American\" burger which is $6.25. Our wings were priced at only $9 for an order of 10, but neither those or the burger came with any kind of side. Ranging from $2-$9, they offer onion rings and about a half a dozen fry options. And because all drinks are canned/bottled, there's no refills, meaning us thirsty folk may need to return for further refreshment.

Some of the other burger options look really interesting, and would certainly bring my back to try, but nothing we had really stood out as something to go out of your way for. If you happen to be in the area, I'd say it's worth checking out as long as you don't have to eat in ice box like temperatures."}
{"text":"For starters this restaurant is very precise when it comes to advertising the pictures and from the actual food identical!! And taste just as good as they look. So far I've tried the A1 burger, cheezesteak, and the crispy chick; All of burgers are finger licking GOOD!! I definitely consider them gourmet burgers. The fries are fresh, crispy, and also tasty. So far I've had the regular fries and chili cheese fries. Wow the chili cheese fries not such a big fan of chili cheese but their chili is absolutely unbearable. 


The Service is by far great, fast, and accurate. The menu it's self is simple and easy to understand which is a plus!! The cooks are unbelievable fast and still manage to assure the quality of the burger is just as delicious as the picture. Prices are fair you pay for what you get which is high quality burgers. As for the cleanliness I give them a 10. (I dislike dirty restrooms or booths!). The Burger lab team are extremely nice and are more than happy to recommend their finest burgers and explain each one. Friendly environment!

I will obviously be coming back to try different burgers!"}
{"text":"We came in to try this place because my husband had heard so many great reviews about it. It was disgusting. The Food sucked and it was way to greasy. I literally left all my food there. I dont understand how it has such great review and it sucked. We def WONT be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"The off menu items as seen on IG seem good but are really expensive for what they are. $16 for shrimp cheese fries...never again. Should have stuck with a burger"}
{"text":"This place has such amazing customer service, the owner and the cook provides such a good atmosphere. The food was realllllly good and reaaally fresh, I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great service, great fresh food! Clean and simple! If you're looking for a new burger joint come support this local business! The only thing I would change is ordering my burger medium rare next time but that is completely my personal preference annnnd I wish this was closer to my side of town! BLT Burger and Bacon and Cheese fries, just do it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!! Their burgers are simply the best, so juicy, so tasty, so DELICIOUS!!! Their onion rings are a must try. The place looks a little empty but their burgers are great. I really hope they can attract more customers. People need to try their burgers."}
{"text":"Highly recommend coming here for any one that loves burgers or any Hispanic origin food tons of varieties!!! This is spot to be !!"}
{"text":"Just returned for my second visit... They switched from a very nice \"home made\" bun to one that has a million sesame seeds on it (over powering)... No a good change. I also discovered that they add .50 cents to the order if it is credit... That does not cut it for me. Some KFC's started that practice and I have not returned... Not cool."}
{"text":"Great local burger joint!!! I got the Bulgogi burger and my bf got the A1 burger. They were both delicious!!! No complaints. 

And the fries were so addicting!!! Perfect texture and perfect size! 

We were giving complementary chips and salsa while waiting for our food and was offered Thrifty ice cream after we were done with our meal. 

Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are awesome here! Love the different types of burgers that can be ordered. Location and interior need some work to match the style food they serve! I would go back and try another burger for sure."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! A super-secret gourmet burger spot that rivals any hipster Bachi Burger or Smashburger out there! Seriously! 

We had their El Niño (a lean burger between two scratch-made pupusas with pickled carrots, cabbage and mild onions, Swiss cheese) and the Cali Chick (a huge chicken breast filet with fresh avocado, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onions and a tarragon aioli on a toasted wheat brioche bun) with their garlic parm fries and their complimentary homemade chips and salsa. Every bit of it was delicious! Would totally order that over and over, but their Bulgogi burger is calling my name.

Total cost was way under $30, and that's a STEAL! You NEED to eat here, and OFTEN! I know I will be!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I had SUCH HIGH EXPECTATIONS being that's they have 4 1/2 stars on yelp and I always trust my fellow yelpers.... with that being said this was the worst experience at a restaurant EVER. Me, my boyfriend and his family wanted to check this place out after a long night and after being starved all day.
So we get there and had one of the staff tell is to have a seat and he will take our order soon. He brought out chips (like 4 chips for 4 people) and salsa and after that it took him about 30 mins to come back and get our order. After waiting for another 30 (1hr total) I thought \"this is ridiculous\" and asked the lady walking around bringing other food out when our food would be out and she said she would go check. Another 10 mins flew by and then she came back out only to bring people that had gotten there about 30 mins after us their food. The lady then came to us and asked us what we wanted to order and that's when we just walked out! The service was beyond horrible, the water was warm and tasted like crap, they have no regard for customers waiting. I was extremely disappointed in everything about that experience and don't know if I am willing to give it another shot. I don't understand how they have that many stars, it makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"Good little spot. Went looking for a good chicken burger and they did they're best. Thanks for hookin it up. Definitely gonna come back to try the pupusa's."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We came here looking for a good burger. Not being locals we turned to yelp, of course, and ventured in.

The location isn't fancy, but we like that. See a hot shot spot in a glitzy hotel doesn't have to be good. A place off the path in a strip mall has to deliver! 

The pastrami burger is amazing. The parm fries are amazing. The BLT burger is amazing. The milkshakes are BOMB. 

If you want a serious burger joint, with a creative selection look no further. 

Pro tip: their Instagram page has their secret menu. Follow @TheBurgerLab"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on yelp and they had it just right. Try three different dishes and all three of us loved it! Flavor is everything and they got it down."}
{"text":"The burgers and the salsa! That's it, that's all you need to know. I've tried the hotwings and the fries and didn't find anything special about them, but the burgers and the salsa...wow! Have I mentioned their burgers and salsa, well you should check them out. The Burgers are darn good with fresh beef, good bread and crisp veggies. This is not a simple bar burger, it's an artisan burger. The salsa has to be made in house because the flavor has been slightly different each time I went, but each time it was great. Don't be fooled by the exterior. This place is literally the wonderful book buried under the lackluster cover. It's not the best burger place in town, but it is the best burger at the price in town. 

I can't go five star crazy because, like I said, the fries are just fries and the wings are just wings. The interior is a little sparse and the service can be a little slow. However, the servers and employees have all been very friendly. Be leery of karaoke night, not because the music is bad, but rather because the place isn't set up for noise so any volume on the Karaoke machine turns the entire restaurant into an experiment on how long one can maintain sanity inside a rattling tin can. That's why no five stars, but the burgers and the salsa are worth any shortcomings. 

BURGERS AND SALSA!!! BURGERS AND SALSA!!! BURGERS AND SALSA!!!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but this place was great and deserves 5 stars. The menu has so many great burgers it's hard to pick just one.  

They have a variety of shakes and they are made with thrifty ice cream. If a corona is your thing they have that too.

My favorite thing about the place is the selection of cheese fries. The have lots of \"not on the menu\" specials that you would only know about if you followed their Instagram page.

Family ran business and the server really hustled while still being attentive and friendly. Affordable, clean and totally worth the drive to this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"We were hoping to get some nice Parmesan fries with fresh shaved parmesan on top. But instead the fries had dried canned parmesan like the kind you get at the grocery store in the little green can.  Also, the meat on both of our hamburgers was so overcook that it was dry and black on the edges.  It's not that this place is really bad.  It's just the cooks that lack the necessary training they need to cook a truly great meam.  On the positive side, service was good and the fresh made chips and salsa was perfect."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that the gourmet burgers are awesome!!! 
I've been there twice now and every time have been completely satisfied!! 
The Hot Chicken Wings are sooo good and child friendly lol my 7 year old loved them. 
You can add fries to your order of wings for $1.. WooHooo score!!
The cheese fries are so good that you wont want to leave any on your plate. 
The Burgers are HUGE!! I have to say that this place makes the patties on the spot for each burger, never frozen ... so everything is fresh and made when its ordered.!!. 
The guacamole burger is delicious and I'm in love with it ;)
The restaurants name really fits their service because its like when you place your order they start creating it. 
Employees are nice, they greet you once you walk in.
Nice music fills the air along with the delicious smells of the food cooking.
The restaurant is clean and there's a lot of seating area.   
Also no issue with parking, big lot out front :)   
I will be returning soon!!

{"text":"First of all, this place is definitely a work in progress, so the inside looks very unfinished.  There is absolutely no decor, and the space is largely empty.  BUT, they seem to be brand-new so I am hesitant to subtract any points as I'm sure they are aware the interior still needs to be spruced.

The food, however, is amazing.  My wife had a classic burger and I had the bulgogi burger and both were absolutely on-point.  You can easily pay much more for a \"gourmet\" burger that is not nearly as flavorful or well prepared as what this little hole-in-the-wall is making.  Highly recommended if you're looking for a casual burger experience with tons of flavor."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service was friendly, and the place is clean. From how it looks outside to the photos of the burgers, what you see is what you get (and more!).

Ordered the Guacamole Burger and it was excellent. It was large, had fresh ingredients, and the guacamole is spot on!  The guac/bacon combo made me happy.  Like!

My friend had the Bulgogi Burger. Huge serving, fresh ingredients, and he described it as \"Juicy\", as a burger should be. Like!

Had the 10-yr old order the A-1 Burger and chili fries. He described it as \"INCREDIBLE!\" Like!

I'm a big fan of burgers, I've spent $11-$50 for \"specialty\" burgers and this place won't disappoint as the average price is around $7.50 per burger. This is worth the try.

Note: They played cartoons on their TV screen, gave complimentary ice cream at the end (no tricky extra charges here, you pay after you order then have your food served to you). They surprsingly had Rainbow sorbet for the kid. Definitely a great place for families and kids."}
{"text":"OK, this place has a serious identity crisis, but don't let that put you off because the food was great.

So it's a Mexican place run by Salvadorians that serves American burgers (some with Asian influences). They also serve Mexican (tacos, burritos, etc.) and Salvadorian (pupusas), but have no menu for those - you just have to ask and they make it to order. And then they have a menu with some delicious burgers. 

I tried the Philly Cheese-steak Burger and it was monstrous, filling, and delicious -- the kind of delicious where you go through 10 napkins and still have to wash your hands after. Just dripping with onions, peppers, and just enough grease to make it taste good but not to leave you feeling disgusting after. 

I'll definitely be back soon to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the outside appearance of this hamburger joint! This is the new place to eat! Burgers are huge and tasty. I love this place and will definitely be coming back for more. The inside looks a little empty like it needs some decoration or a special touch of some thing but the food is what counts."}
{"text":"La Parilla The Lab is a gem in Las Vegas . Chef Carlor has excellent senses for taste, his burgers are so good they will have you coming back. His creativity with natural ingredients give all his dishes a unique taste. I so happens to be in the area for business and got hungry around lunch time. Yelp has great reviews so I gave it a try. Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Went with my girl here before heading to the strip.  Burgers were both Juicy and flavorfull.  We both Especially liked the bulgogi.  Garlic parm frys were good too.  Nice and crispy and were cooked in fresh oil.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"Don't know what the whole hyped about this place is. Literally waited 20mins to get greeted, another 45 to get two burgers. To top it off the food was gross it makes me sick by thinking of it. One and done for me. Do I recommend? Nope!"}
{"text":"As we arrived, we were struck with the bold yellow and red colors of the building- traditionally expected of Mexican restaurants, not so much burger joints. We like unique and novel experiences, so we were looking forward to it. We were directed to find some seats and literally sank into bench seats that have definitely seen better days. I was okay with that- I often find broken in benches to be more comfortable.
   Several minutes later, she came out with some water. The combination of dark lighting and badly-selected color patterns have created very  hard to read menus so it took us a while to figure out what to eat. They offer some very interesting items like cinnamon or pineapple tea, a variety of pupusas, great sounding ingredients on burgers, and several types of fries (bacon cheese, carne asada, gravy, cheese, chili cheese, french, garlic parm). Several minutes after the water, she brought out homemade chips and salsa. Later she brought out more chips, but they were burned.
  While ordering, I made a point of stating I am allergic to onions, and she actually had me change my order to avoid them. But when she brought out the appetizer she had suggested, it had onions. BF asked about them, and she explained like there was nothing wrong that onions are a part of this dish- what???!!!
  The main items came out- I had ordered a chicken burger because she said their normal hamburgers have onions in the meat. But when she brought the chicken burger out, it was stacked with onions! We stated the problem. She acknowledged it and said she'd told the chef about my allergy (again- what about the appetizer?). She said she'd get it fixed and took the burger away. With lightning speed she was back with my \"fixed\" burger. Turns out, the chef had just removed the onions and sent the food back out to me. Problem 1- if I had a life threatening allergy, instead of just making me sick this would have put me in the hospital. Problem 2- according to health code, they can't bring food back from the dining room, alter it, and send it back out to me. They should have started fresh, but they were too cheap to fix their mistake the right way.
  While eating, we asked for water 3 times before bf gave up and brought our glasses to the counter. Then she brought us a pitcher so she wouldn't have to check on us. This would have been appropriate and appreciated IF they'd been busy, but we were the only ones there until we had finished eating and were waiting for our bill (1 woman came in and sat in a near booth). While we were still waiting for the bill, 1 of the staff came out, turned on the TV that was maybe 3 tables away from us, and started yelling at the players on the screen.
  Regarding the food, it was not good. I ate half of the burger and didn't bring any leftovers home. I ate a little more than half of the appetizer and literally gagged on my last bite. Bf stated that his buffalo chicken was marginal at absolute best. He didn't bring anything home either 
  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Customized my \"El Nino\" burger just as I wanted. The taste was BOMB! really cool of the staff to let me change the channel to watch playoff hockey. GO KINGS GO!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and they never disappointed. Today was somewhat different. I won't take away from their food at all, it's probably one of the best food places I've been to in Vegas. I understand that at a restaurant like this with great food, it may tend to get busy. I just happened to be on my hour lunch for work and as I usually do, I call 15 minutes before leaving my job to make sure. Today was just the only time it has happened to where I feel the person who answered forgot about the customer. I waited 22 minutes on hold. I understand they had to care for the people already there. I heard them take orders and silence after. Maybe they were short handed or something but it's just a bummer waiting that long to where you fee neglected. I'll definitely still dine at this restaurant. But I guess next time I go for my lunch at work, I'll call half an hour ahead and cross my fingers the food isn't cold."}
{"text":"Thumbs up to the chef I had the Bulging burger and it was awsome so flavorful.   I have a lot of respect for a chef that uses the best ingredients.   The lettuce was of good quality and the buns were tasty the burger was juicy. I  would have expected to pay more for my burger, there serving up gourmet burger place with a regular burger feel.  I most definitely will be back."}

{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but my very first visit left a sour taste in my mouth. Their menu and food pictures on yelp look great. I think their collective dishes are very unique. A burger place with a Latin influence. 

The complimentary chips and salsa they serve are great. The salsa flavor is addicting! I would order this again even though it's free.

Today I had their crispy chicken sandwich with cole slaw, fried egg, and brown gravy. I also had gravy fries, parm fries, and a quesadilla. Yes, I shared with someone!

My sandwich was good. I expected it to be a little more special? It did the job but was nothing special. Maybe it was because the egg yolk wasn't runny. Maybe it was because the gravy was flat. 

The fries were both disappointing. Fries should be hot, crisp, and ADDICTING! They are a guilty pleasure that you can't help but uncontrollably munch on. I remember not taking a to go box and not finishing half of either fries. The gravy fries came luke-warm and sad. Garlic parm fries lacked any garlic or parm flavor.

I didn't have any of the quesadilla but it just seemed like a run of the mill quesadilla I could have made at home. 

The price was affordable and the food was okay.

What sucked most? Our server who only came by to drop stuff off. He was also watching a soccer match. He was also having a beer at a table next to us and never stopped by. Never got refills. We had to walk up for our check. He forgot what we ordered. We had to tell home what we ate at the register. Out of the kindness of my heart and wanting a local business to succeed I was completely honest. I'm also giving them a three out of the kindness of my heart in hopes that my next visit is better in all aspects.

Affordable, poor service, okay food. Will I return? Yes, but not in a rush."}
{"text":"THE LAB IS DEAD.

All that's left is the sad remnants of their burger menu as drably interpreted by a Guatemalan restaurant using subpar ingredients and fast food execution. 

Clue #1: We were literally the only ones there during dinnertime on a Saturday.

Clue #2: More than half the place was set up as an even sadder attempt at a Latin club (see photo). Again, exactly zero people present, other than the \"DJ\" and his late middle aged companion. So our disappointing burger meal was accompanied by blasting reggaeton.

The food: The ($18) surf and turf fries were covered in cheezewiz and overnight grocery store guac, with a stingy amount of \"asada\" and 4-5 shrimps. The wings tasted straight from the freezer with salad dressing ranch. The only passable part of the meal was my El Nino burger, which was meh and looked absolutely nothing like photos from the Lab's glory days.

RIP The Lab. Let's not contort your legacy by trying to house you in a wanna be Guatemalan dance club."}
{"text":"I think just about anybody can crave a good burger from time to time. And La Parilla's presentation got me through the door, and the price and taste will get me to return. 

Located in somewhat of an awkward location on East Flamingo in between a few commercial centers it seemed like an afterthought of a restaurant. Id never have come here if it wasnt for Yelp. Walk thru the doors and there isnt much to be seen or had either, with plastic tarp style sign menu and no frills dining area i almost was turned off. But the guys behind the counter seems informative and i have to try the Bulgogi Burger ive been eyeing pics of for over a week. Presentation is solid looking between a yummy mess to a larger version of Bachi depending on what you order. Ingredients seem fresh and the combinations are good but not gourmet good like a Bachi. The onion rings have a somewhat sweet taste to them making them a big different and worthy of trying. The fries were just fries, nothing to talk about. 

Philly Burger with wiz - Was a mess, decent, but all the wiz took away from tasting the actually burger itself. 6.5/10 

Bulgogi Burger - Fresh veg, Bulgogi marinade was good actually and complimented the burger 8.5/10 

Lets be honest at $7.50-7.95/ burger for the size, and ingredients your used to paying closer to $10. Im interested in coming back to give it another whirl on something different but not too often as i dont want to become a fat ass."}
{"text":"First impressions were hard to make. Coworkers (and Google) had told us the place was called \"The Burger Lab\". When we arrived, we saw it was called \"La Parilla -- The Lab.\" There was confusion but we still settled in. I thought that The Burger Lab was a cool upstart that fizzled out and was replaced by another business that kind of did the same thing.

This put me at at disadvantage. I didn't get a burger. Why? I wasn't sure if it would actually be good. I thought it was a Salvadoran restaurant that served burgers because you need the appeal to your audience and Salvadoran food isn't a grab like burgers are. 

I was skeptical of the Bulgogi burger, Korean meat served as part of an American hamburger in this Salvadoran restaurant. Coworker swore by it, but I thought it was too risky. I went with some shredded meat with peppers meal. It was something I envisioned close to what \"Ropa Vieja\" is in Cuban cuisine (shredded beef in delicious sauce over tasted black beans and rice).

Well stick to burgers. Meet wasn't super warm and it's in a bit of it's own sauces. Beef had subdued flavor, expecting more of a variety of spices to the dish. It came with some rice which was bland. Mixing the rice with the meat sauce is not optional, it's mandatory. There was what I assumed to be Salvadoran potato salad, but if I was skeptical of burgers here, you know I wasn't eating something with what I assumed was made of mayonnaise in it. Hey, I tried it and it was not something I wanted to continue eating. 

As for the restaurant, it's a lot bigger than you would think. Plenty of TVs around the place. There is a Touch Tunes jukebox that was set to Jet Engine levels of loud when I operated it. Luckily the staff gave me the remote to turn it down. I figure this place is pretty crazy on the weekend.

The unfortunate thing that ended our visit was the fact that the restaurant's credit card machine system was down. This was a serious problem for a lot of us, well pretty much anyone, since carrying cash is a novelty at this point. Great thing was, I'm a novel guy so I was able to pay for my meal and walk out. The rest of my coworkers were not as fortunate. The restaurant was not prepared to handle something like this. Not sure it occurs often but bringing cash wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"I've found the holy grail of Las Vegas burger joints! I tried the A1 and bulgogi burger, and the garlic parmesean fries. Needless to say, I am so happy to have found this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Just got a bulgogi burger to go.  Good sized burger, justifies the price.  I might prefer some other cheese than American, but other than that I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Just skip this place. I came here because it was 4 stars on yelp. Needless to say I was disappointed. The burger was just okay at best and the garlic fries were just to much of whatever it was. 

I had the avacodo bacon burger. This was one messy burger. Carl's Jr would be proud. The bacon was really good, the meat on the burger was just okay and everything else way just a little over board as it was almost hard to eat the way it was constucted. At one point I did take the burger apart just to taste the meat. Which was okay at best. 

The parm garlic fries where almost on eatable with the amount of garlic and parm it had on them. If I were to go back here I would aviod these at all cost. 

I won't have worry about this as nothing about this place was remarkable even though it is only walking distance from where I am staying I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I came to La Parrilla The Lab a few nights ago with my dad after seeing the strong reviews on Yelp.  Actually, the final decision maker was the pictures.  The burgers looked amazing and I knew I had to try one.

The restaurant was completely empty when we walked in.  We weren't even sure the place was open when we pulled into the parking lot.  But it was open and we were welcomed in and greeted promptly.  We were given the opportunity to sit any where.  A benefit of eating at an empty restaurant.  After each of us ordered a Bud Light, we looked a the menu for a few minutes.  Both my dad and I wanted to try the Bulgogi Burger.  Again, I saw on Yelp and knew I had to try it.  We each ordered our own fries too.  My dad got the chili cheese fries.  I had garlic parmesan fries.  

It took a little while for a food to come out but I could smell it cooking.  I knew it was fresh.  The burgers looked awesome when they came out.  A soft artisan bun and a burger with toppings stacked high.  The fries were equally impressive. My dad's chili cheese fries were covered with the title ingredients and a generous portion of chopped onions.  I tried one bite and could tell it was a good quality chili.  My fries were great as well.  And very fragrant at that.  Between the garlic and parmesan, it was almost offensive.  I savored every bite.

We both thoroughly enjoyed our bugers.  They were cooked to a nice medium which is perfect for me.  My dad I think would have preferred his more rare but it was not a point he felt it was necessary to make.  We both were impressed with the bulgogi beef topping our burgers.  It was sweet and tender.  It added an almost teriyaki flavor to the burger.  Not a bad thing.

The food here is good.  For a nearly hidden hole-in-the-wall burger bar they are knocking out some good food.  Beware though.  The price can sneak up on you. $7.95 for a burger seems alright.  But add $3 or $4 fries and $4 beers to that and you have yourself a sneaky $30+ tab for only two people.  It adds up when you have to order items separate from each other because they don't have meals like a lot of other places.  Not that they are unique in that way.  I've been to other restaurants that do the same thing.  Just know it going in."}
{"text":"Great burgers, really fantastic fries. Get the garlic parmesan fries, they're A++ Very fresh, big portions, super flavorful. It's not the fanciest place, but if you're in it for the looks, go be disappointed by an overpriced burger joint on the strip."}
{"text":"This place what can I say mind blowing ! This new  undiscovered burger place is my new burger joint. What really surprised me was how the picture looked exactly same when it was served on my table. Best burgers I have had yet.

{"text":"Amazing!! we had the ensalada to drink and it's one of the best I have EVER had! they give you chips and salsa while waiting for your food and the homemade salsa is great. they're burgers are seriously juicy and delicious. we also had the cheese and bacon fries and those were super amazing. the barbecue wings were some of the best I've ever had! can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is a dive, in the BEST kind of way! Walking in I was a little confused as to how to order/sit, but you can dine in or carry out. I dined in with a group of 6. The server helped us figure out the menu. I had a 1 UP burger with a beef patty added to it, and it was great. My daughters had the burgers and fries and they wolfed them down. It was also cool to be able to get Coke in glass bottles. There are so many options and even a secret menu, but you'll have to stop in to experience that for yourself."}

The el niño is next on my check list. This place has a latin american influence, so i want to check out a burger with pickled onions and pupasas instead of buns.  

Had the bulgogi burger, it was a sweeter variation than what I expected and needed a bit of hot sauce for my taste. Next time i'll add jalapeños"}

{"text":"First time trying this place with my husband both guys that attended us were super freindly i dont like trying new places ive had bad experiences in the past but my first impression of food and resturaunt was great i will deffenitly be coming back to try other things on there menu i got the lemon pepper wings with fries on the side they were delicious i deffenitly recomend"}
{"text":"Diners, drive-in's and dives should come here!  These burgers are simply amazing.  I can't wait to come back again and try the rest of the menu.  The staff were super friendly and even gave us free ice cream after our meal which I'm pretty sure was from Thrifty Ice cream which is my favorite.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  The portions are large and the flavors are fantastic.  If you love burgers than this is your new favorite spot!  I'll be back with all of my family and friends very soon."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible food!!!!service was bad and food was disgusting they gave my family food that we never ordered plus we waited an hour to get out food and it wasn't even busy there was only one other family there and Then To top it of I never receive my Cajun shrimp fries never ever will I go there this place is not worth it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"While my burger was NOT cooked medium as requested, I'm still going with 5 Stars. No, this is not a fancy strip location but sits in a humble strip mall location a few miles up Flamingo Rd. Here are the reasons I am going with 5 Stars. The burger really had awesome flavor, excellent toppings and fresh ingredients. They are all handcrafted burgers and made with care. The staff's working here are super friendly and could handle all my picky requests! Sauce on the side, side of gravy, side of cheese sauce. Actually that's what they specialize in is off menu request for customizing your burger to the way you like it. Free chips and salsa that was awesome as well. Family owned and operated these guys are a hidden gem that's worth the travel!  Don't expect to be wowed by the ambiance, but if you're going to keep prices down (about $8 Bucks a burger) and share that with your guest, then you're doing right by me. Also, no gimmicky up charges for all the extras I requested!!  A little confused with the Spanish name and the mix of American with a hint of Spanish on the menu. Whatever! It worked for me!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! !  Had the Bulgogi. Recommend this place to all Vegas foodies. And I'm a local Chef.  Great service.. Great food.. Great location.  And ice cream??  What more could you ask for. My new fix."}
{"text":"Experience:  I was taking my Grandpa out to lunch, and I used YELP to find a place nearby that serves something he will eat. He won't eat anything besides American and Italian. A burger place is pretty safe. It was noon on a Monday. 

Facility:  It's located in a pretty deserted strip mall on the end. Once you walk inside, it's a pretty big size, but not too many tables, which is a god thing. There's about 8 booths and 4 large table and chair seating. It's a diner type atmosphere with minimal decor. 

Service:  We were greeted as soon as we came in by a nice waiter. We sat down and he served us immediately. He checked back several times over and over again. 

Food: They put chips and salsa down as soon as you sit. The chips are delicious, but the salsa tastes way too heavy on the raw onion side for me. Weird...there's no salt on the table. I usually salt my chips.  
We ordered a couple of regular burgers American style and a side of fries to share. 
I was a little surprised the waiter didn't ask how we wanted the burger cooked. However, it still came med-well, so that was good. 
The burgers were big, cooked well and with a nice flavor. There were plenty of toppings, including a lot of pickles, which makes me happy. 
The fries were hot, fresh and tasty. They didn't need any additional salt, so maybe that's why there's no shakers on the table. I only ate a few because I filled up on the chips. 

Overall:  This is a good burger spot, especially for the price. They have some other things on the menu and secret menu that I want to try like the shrimp cocktail, tacos, and ceviche, but today was just a burger day. I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"This 3/5 review is specifically due to a solidly delicious burger (4/5)  I had here. But when it comes to service, this place deserves a 1/5!!

We had just picked our friends up from the airport and they were starving. I'd heard this place had good burgers and it wasn't to far from home, so we stopped by. It was around 3p on a very rainy Saturday. The place was empty except for maybe one or two other tables. We picked our table and menus were brought out right away. I had only seen pictures of burgers on Yelp, so I was surprised when a multi-page Mexican menu was handed to me and the burgers were listed on a small separate menu. 

During the first twenty minutes there, our waitress was very aggressive about asking if we were ready to order yet. But between good conversation with friends we hadn't seen in a while and several pages of a menu to dig through, we needed some time. We also had some questions since we'd never eaten there. And with every question we asked, she answered with as few words as possible and seemed very disappointed if we asked for further details. 

When we finally did get the order in, things just got worse. I think it was around twenty minutes that she delivered a burger and fries to me. But not only was I the only one she put food in front of, the order was also wrong (I ordered no bun and wanted LOADED fries). Of course I didn't want to eat since no one else had their food. So we continued to wait...5-10 minutes later she came back, mumbled something about a mistake and took the burger and fries away. We waited a solid 10-15 minutes more for all of our food to arrive! We watched other tables that ordered after us (this place had started to fill up) get their food!! I can't believe our food finally came out at all, let alone as ordered. 

Thank goodness I enjoyed my burger as much as I did after all that nonsense. But I think the people who hadn't gotten burgers and got fajitas instead weren't as impressed - it looked pretty mediocre. It probably didn't help that our waitress brought out their tortillas after our men had already inhaled their food. 

I ordered the Pastrami burger. It was also covered in perfectly melted cheese and some delicious chili. This was a sizable pile of goodness!

And while my loaded fries certainly didn't look like much, they were actually pretty good! The fries looked frozen, the cheese was in two forms - sauce and unmelted shredded. But with real chunks of bacon it somehow came together and was pretty yummy!

Throughout the rest of our time the bad service continued. No drink refills, no checking in on us and impossible to find when we were more than ready for the bill. We didn't even bother asking her to split the check because we didn't want to have to wait any longer.

So, I guess if you feel ok with crap service, go check out this burger!"}
{"text":"The Bulgogi Burger was awesome.  It was so piping hot I had to wait to eat it.  The beef was very flavorful and the spicy aoli on the side kicked it up a notch.  This place is brand new and not in the best location, but the burger I had was very, very good.  If you're a burger geek check it out!"}
{"text":"Little hard to find but worth the journey. Ill definitely be back again to try more of whats on the menu. Great service and great food. Go down and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"The food was great! Had garlic parmesan fries & Cali chicken burger. Was so good. The girl that served us super nice too. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because place isn't the nicest looking but looks clean, food is good & service was great!"}
{"text":"Its just too mediocre. I got my hopes up walking into this place because it wasn't a chain operation--can't justify trying them again though"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? It used to be a cool burger joint. It looks a lot nicer but the menu is different. Burgers are more of an after thought. The main menu is huge and full of things you can get from street vendors. The service is bad too. Our server didn't really know English and even with me pointing to the menu item I wanted he still got it wrong. They don't even have iced tea, that's so ghetto."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they thought I wanted an order of salt to go or if I should have said I wanted wings with salt. I received the most saltiness wings I have ever had in my life.  I had to guzzle my Arizona tea in order to finish this meal and I like to sip my tea."}
{"text":"Saw the El Niño burger on yelp and just had to try this place! So glad I did because it is by far the best think invented  the mixed pupusas with the patty and mozzarella cheese in the middle is so satisfying I didn't even eat diner that day! I've been back twice and it never disappoints! Fries were okay little mushy, rice was white with veggies and tasty but the beans were bland."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try based on the reviews.  No joke.  They make a mean burger.  We ordered a cheese steak burger and a bulgogi burger. Both were beyond satisfying. The parmesan fries were good..not great but good.  The pupusa was eehhh...i say stick to burgers.
The service wasn't the best, but I came to eat not get waited on, plus you cant expect much considering its located in a quiet strip mall. The server was nice but seemed to forget orders and prices. Other than that it was a good experience. We'd definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is absolutely amazing. Don't let the unassuming look fool you. The food is on point. The service is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Creative fresh food with great flavor. Friendly service. Hot and delicious fries and onion rings. Would come back to try more on the menu. Delicious Cali Chick burger. Loved the aioli!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying this place!  A friend recommended it last week and I had to try it!  I got the bulgogi burger and it was phenomenal!  Can't go wrong with tender and juicy!  The owner was our server for the night.  He was extremely attentive and very friendly!  One of my cousins wanted a bulgogi burger without onion, but we were told the onion was already mixed in.  Next thing you know, the food arrived and we're told by the owner that he tried his best to pick out all of the onions for her!  After finishing our meal, we were brought over free ice cream!  Amazing first experience!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best customer service I have had in years. The guy was very attentive. The food was very fresh and flavorful. I don't have any complaints besides the fact that more people should know about it"}
{"text":"I bookmarked this because I saw fellow Yelper Roger check in at this place. After Roger said it was tasty and I saw the pics on Yelp I knew the hubby and I would love it. We happened to be on that side of town for a doctors appointment and were early and hungry so we stopped in. 

Burger Lab is set far back in a very unassuming strip mall. You may think they only serve burgers, but they have so much more! We were greeted by a friendly guy and he asked if this was our first time there. I said \"yes, we heard good things about you on Yelp.\" He started telling us about the menu. Not only do they have amazing sounding burgers, but they have Carne Asada fries and even Pupusas! I couldn't pass up the Carne Asada fries. Joel ordered the Cheesesteak Burger. I also really loved that they had other diet options when it came to soda. Yay! 

We grabbed our cold cans of Coke Zeroes and found a booth. While waiting for our food they brought us out a basket filled with fresh chips and homemade salsa. It was really tasty! Totally reminded me of my mom's salsa. We were both sad when the chips were gone. But not for long cause the rest of our order came out. Wow! My Carne Asada Fries were huge! They were served in big pasta plate. The fries were covered in cheese sauce (my fav), beans, loads of Carne Asada, guacamole and sour cream. I really loved that they served them with limes. Very authentic! Joel's Cheesesteak Burger was huge as well. It was literally dripping in cheese sauce. He didn't even know were to start. Super messy!  The burger and toppings were bountiful and tasty. 

My only complaint would be please turn up the air! It was super hot and I sweated the whole time. Other then that the food rocked and I love that they offer more then just burgers. That was a great surprise. I can't wait to check Burger Lab out again for all their other culinary gems!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, there's something for everyone.  I would have never known about it if I hadn't been told, the spot is kinda hidden but it's a hidden gem..."}
{"text":"The location is a bit hidden, easy to miss it but when found, is a great food experience!

First of the service was great! Our order was taken on a timely matter and the lady was very nice and attentive. We received our food fairly quickly too. 

We order burgers the A1 & Bulgogy burger and Oh my word!! Delicious!! I'm real picky with ranch as well some are good but the ranch in this location was bomb! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Salvadorean food, this is the place! We came here with our grandkids 8/14/2017.  They're picky eaters, but at this place they gobbled up pupusas, casamiento, chips and even salsa!  The waitress was very nice and accommodating.  Thank you for the good food.  The place is clean and well decorated with pictures, paintings and artifacts from Mexico and Central America."}
{"text":"This has become one of my guilty pleasures in the city of sin. I promise to you, if you can create it in your mind it can be presented to you on a plate. My only problem is that I have such a hard time expressing my creativity through food. Then again, just give me one of these burgers with whatever toppings fit my mood for the day and I'm set!!! The first time I came here, I made a mistake and ordered this delicious milkshake that appeared to have been created by the milkshake gods themselves! I ordered a papusa, had chips and salsa, then had the audacity to order a burger smh. I was so miserably satisfied!!

 The second time I knew better than to order a milkshake or anything outside of the BLT burger this time with bacon/cheese french fries. I'm not lying when I tell you I literally left 1 bite of my burger because I had tapped out. Come with an imagination and an appetite...you've been warned."}
{"text":"Solid 3-3.5 star spot!  I think the RIGHT burger could have pushed me to a 4 personally.

It's almost a \"hood burger\" being on E Flamingo, without the super cheap prices and/or the home cookin' hospitality.  Don't get me wrong, it's not expensive by any means, just not a Fat Boy for instance.

I went with the Pastrami Burger ($7.95): Chili, Swiss Cheese, Mustard & Pickle. SOLID burger, cooked to MR+ with initial juices on the squeeze.  The chili is pretty good too and was the highlight of the burger for me :)  

The burger also had lots of mustard...just wish the pastrami was a little more flavorful to compensate. It was cut thick, a bit chewy, and did not have the crispy / caramelized edges I love...reminded me of a less rendered pork belly / bacon consistency.  It definitely got hidden in the burger/chili combination, until you had to chew it up separately of course, since the rest of the burger melts in your mouth in comparison.

Also ordered the Chili Cheese Fries ($3.95). Didn't realize the Pastrami Burger already came with Chili, so I was quite overloaded with it LOL. These were topped off with LOTS of Cheez Whiz...good stuff!  A bit heavy in the end...I'd share with someone bigger than a 2yr old :P 

I also got to try Roger's Garlic Parmesan Fries...these were pretty tasty!  TONS of parmesan cheese clumped up in small bits, with a good amount of garlic flavor.  Recommended :)

With burger, chili cheese fries and a drink, I was at $15.  This felt fair in my book, but perhaps you guys should consider a combo meal (Roger's idea)?  One of the tame burgers, basic fries and a fountain drink for $9.95 for instance?

I am sure I will be back to try another burger since it isn't too far from the strip :)"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I had a meal there we had the guacamole burger, cheese steak burger, parmesan fires, tiramisu, and cheesecake. Guac burger and fried were good. Wasn't a huge fan of the cheese steak burger. The burgers were cooked well done, normally I'd have liked a med rare temp. Cheese cake was good and the tiramisu would had been perfect if it wasn't frozen. Prices were reasonable and the service was friendly. The dining room is a little rough but whatever no biggie. All in all I'd say it was pretty good. Nothing mind blowing, but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"An amazing combination of gourmet style burgers, traditional Mexican, mouth watering presentation, and super friendly customer service.
for me. I come by quite often to try something new off their extensive menu."}
{"text":"The burgers are very delicious and creative. The burger that I ordered was very delicious. I wished the burger was as big as the bun tho. The service was very good. Make bigger meat patties please. The pupusa was a hidden treat. Love their different flavors. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you want good burgers this is the place to go! The burgers are incredibly delicious. Best part is that the burgers actually look like their pictures! & also good customer service."}
{"text":"Quaint place with BIG FLAVORS!! Totally worth the drive from Henderson. They give you in-house made chips & salsa while you wait for your food. I got the AWESOME Cheesesteak Burger & the scrumptious Parmesan Fries. I can't wait to be back & try another great burger from this joint!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. First of all we walk in and no one is in the front to greet until someone from the back finally comes and hands us menus. So we sit down. We order and my boyfriend asked for fries and 2 pupusas and what does he get? He gets only one. Then the lady who was cooking comes to one table to ask about the food skips ours and goes to the table behind us I'm assuming some of her family members and completely ignored us. Place is dirty and disgusting setting and I'm sorry but the food is horrible. Not up to par with the buzz as far as the wings I ate. Never coming back to this place again !"}
{"text":"Saw a few pictures and had to try it.  Went for a late weekend lunch. The restaurant definitely needs a little TLC, and it kinda smelled funny, but the waiter was friendly and the chips and salsa were yummy, but he seemed to forget about us after he dropped them off, as it took a while for him to return with our drinks. When we finally placed our order we'd been there for quite some time and there was only 2 other tables seated.  The tacos and pupusas were delicious but my burger looked nothing like the (numerous) pictures posted to yelp and instagram.  The meat was *much smaller than the bun and had virtually none of the sauce that was supposed to be on it, and despite the burger being flavorful and juicy, it still needed the condiment.  After he dropped off our food, our waiter never came back, and that's unfortunate because I couldn't order the milkshake I wanted or request more sauce, and he forgot to put in for the chili cheese fries we had ordered so we didn't get to try them.  Overall the food was great and the photos from other diners are intriguing, so we will be back. Hopefully that was just an off-day because I really like to see unique places like this grow and succeed, but good food isn't the only thing that brings people back... service is also very important."}
{"text":"The best thing was the chips and salsa. I ordered a shrimp cocktail and it tasted very fishy and BAD (like the shrimp was bad). I only had 2-3 bites at most, and they charged me full price for it. Very bad customer service. Fast forward 12 hours. I'm SICK SICK SICK SICK violently throwing up and cannot hold anything down. I'll spare you the details of the whole food poisioning expirence, but trust me it was 2 days of HELL! THESE GUYS WON'T BE IN BUSINESS LONG WITH THEIR BAD FOOD HANDLING PRACTICE AND LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. I PLAN ON CALLING THE HEALTH DISTRICT AND REPORTING MY ISSUE.
STEER CLEAR! YOU WILL THANK ME LATER."}
{"text":"This place was a very pleasant surprise. A1 burger is so good and the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Burgers are my fav and yours are bomb. I had the guacamole burger. A huge fatty party with delish house made guac. (Sorry if I insulted asking if it was one of those squeeze tube guacs). Seriously-- good burger. 
Fries are large and shareable so make sure to do so. My husband got their bulgogi burger and he said it was very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"WORST BURGER EXPERIENCE!!!!

First off this place does not look like a gourmet burger joint. It looks like a Roberto's. And then we walk in the lady hands us a menu and tells us to sit anywhere, which we did. There was only one couple and then my husband, my daughter, and I. It took the lady like 15 minutes to even come take our order. The concept of the whole burger lab was never explained to us. We didn't know what we can add on or how much the add ons were.

So we ordered two bulgogi burgers (mine was the regular and my husband got one with one extra patty and extra bacon). Then we order bacon and cheese fries. And ordered some drinks. Now we're thinking this place is just starting up but it's like a sit down dinner. Nope!! The only good thing about this place was the burgers! We ordered $4 fries which was a small bowl of skinny fries with cut up bacon and what I'm guessing is melted kraft slices. And the drinks we got were $2 each (we got Peach juice, dr. Pepper, and a small water which turned out to be a big water bottle) these were not Fountain drinks. They gave us bottled drinks, FOR TWO DOLLARS!! Oh and the first time the lady took our order, she lost our ticket so the chef had to come out and retake our order.  WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THERE. And then on top of that they started playing Spanish music,  just blasting it!

And at the end of the night we paid $40 for everything. The lady didn't even show us our bill, so we didn't know until we paid that they charged my husband for 3 extra patties instead of 1! This place is TERRIBLE!!! DO NOT GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Just left......extremely dissapointed. Husband found on yelp today, we headed out there as soon as he got off work 5:30pm, mind you he works down the street. Got excited, didnt know it existed, had lunch at 11am so really hungry.....open the door....no one there.....waited.....waited some more.......called \"hello\" ...no bell, no person.....noise in the background as if someone cleaning, loud radio so we thought, radio too loud? Lets whistle.....still waiting......almost 15 min go by......sad face, have to go.......hungry and dissapointed. Will give it one more chance? According to reviews, we should....humm we will see."}
{"text":"Excellent gourmet burgers. I wish they would do a little touch up to the place. But the food is so great, we over looked the place. I see them growing and opening a restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends for lunch 
And the cashier guy was nice. My friends ordered burgers and I ordered buffalo shrimp fries. When I got my fries they were not buffalo nor looked like the pic on their Instagram. I'm not going to lie though whatever flavor shrimp fries were they were delicious. Kinda tasted like San Pedro seafood platter for those of who've Been there know what I'm talking about. As for the restaurant it serves Mexican, Salvadorian, wings and burgers. I feel as though they're all over the place. I'm not sure which one is there speciality. That's why they're called the lab I guess they experiment with all types of food. The restaurant does have a funny smell to it as well."}
{"text":"Don't you hate when you look up the hours and directions only to find they are wrong and you wasted your time driving there? Well, the hours on the door say they are open, but the entire place is dark and i'm locked out. Still hungry."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips before meal nice touch, but salsa is really watered down  chips are really good , wish salsa would be more like a pico de gallo. But hamburgers are still very pleasing. And still this place does not have any coke bottles with my name on it....smh"}
{"text":"This is the address of La Parrilla The Lab. We went to eat there December 20th. They had not changed the name to Bripolis. The 250 reviews listed here are not for this restaurant. They are under new management and I had the worst experience here than anywhere in Las Vegas. The service was HORRIBLE. Our server stated the sentence \"I'm so sorry\" way over ten times. When I asked about burgers she said the the restaurant was under new management and had a new menu. When I ordered from the \"new menu\", she said that what I ordered (enchiladas)was a mistake and shouldn't be on the menu. She eventually brought one meal at a time (several minutes) apart. The first meal (chicken burrito) was inedible. The chicken was like mush. The next meal was a beef taco because they didn't have enough beef to fill a burrito. The next burrito had salsa and other things that we asked not to be included and we sent it back and I never received my meal. We decided to pay for what had been delivered ( we should not have had to pay) and we left. The food that we ordered took over 20 minutes to start arriving at our table and we were the only customers. This place is a fraud and the reviews listed here should be removed because they are for a different restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could I would bump this up to 3.5 stars but the reality is that the Burger is a 4 star burger but the sides, service and storefront make it a 3.  

I tried the A-1 Aioli Burger.  The Burger was fantastic.  The bun better than last time, sturdier and less stale tasting.  I thought, as last time, that the seasoning was lacking but in this case it worked as I got to enjoy the flavorful meat of the burger.  

We ordered the gravy fries which were, sadly, disappointing.  Flooded in gravy that was more like gray water than a flavorful delight.  The fries were fresh but soggy and, pet peeve of mine, served without utensils. Seriously, how do you eat soggy fries in gravy without a fork.  Several napkin trips later we were able to finish and leave.

The wasted space and lack of soda machine or tea choices remained an issue and quite honestly, although the tables were clean, the floors and the restroom were not up to my standards.

This could be a 4+ star establishment if they would put some pride into the location. 
They do put pride in the burgers and the chips though and that is appreciated."}
{"text":"really good quality meat and ingredients. the burger was hot all the way thru and tasted great. the fries were crispy, had lots of seasoning on them and it came with a fork to keep the parmesan all over the fries even at the middle of the pack. it was a lot of food too, this is a great little joint to watch the game and have a juicy burger and a cold one, def coming back,"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, with a colleague, on a Thursday afternoon...We were the only customers here...I have to say that the food is delicious! I had the Cali Chick and the chicken was great...juicy and flavorful. The tarragon aioli was tasty. The sandwich bun was soft and fresh...we shared an order of fries and an order of onion rings. Both were hot, crisp, and not greasy...perfect! Service was friendly...I will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"So had food from this place for the first time. I was really excited about trying this place. However, after seating down and eating it , I wasn't wowed. I ordered their BLT and the burger had no flavor. Carne asada fries were good, but nothing special about them. My gf had the hot wings and Parmesan wings. She said that the hot wings were alright, but horribly disappointed with Parmesan wings. The Parmesan wings had no flavor at all. Now I would have given his place 3 stars, but after paying $42 I had to give it 2 stars. The food was way overpriced for what it was. Guy was polite but they were short handed. Definitely wouldn't come back for the wings or fries."}
{"text":"It was absolutely disgusting. I think I had the bulgogi burger and it was covered in this gelatinous muck. The garlic parm fries were covered in salt and over cooked. The guys there seemed nice but I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"What do you call a cow with no legs?  Ground beef.  
What do you call a cow with two legs?  Lean beef. 
Okay, okay, I'll stop. 

Went on Saturday 2-13-16 at 6:15PM.  This restaurant is located on Flamingo between McLeod and Eastern.  The vibe is casual and while we were there they were setting up equipment to do karaoke.  They did have a TV playing Iron Man 3 which I liked. 

 $37.66 got us a buffalo chicken sandwich, cheese fries, parmesean fries, a cali chick burger, a jarritos, a Corona, and a cheese pupusa.  Service was very friendly, if not a bit slow.    We were brought very thick tortilla chips and \"salsa\" which was more like tomato soup with a bit of cilantro in it.  

Cali Chick Burger $7.95
Tarragon aioli, lettuce, tomato and grilled marinated chicken breast with Swiss cheese and avocado. Husband said it was very tasty and he enjoyed it.  

Buffalo Chicken Burger $7.95
Lettuce, tomato, onions and crispy chicken breast tossed in Frank's hot Buffalo sauce with a side of ranch.  Chicken was hot, fresh, and tasty although there was no ranch in sight.  

Cheese Pupusa $1.95
Very tasty de maiz with lots of gooey cheese inside.  It was served with the traditional red sauce and cabbage.  Pretty good value for the money, although I wish chicken was an option to go inside it.  

The fries were $2.95 each and IMHO tasted just like very undercooked McDonalds fries.  They had no golden-brown tinge at all.  The parmesean ones were the best but still they needed a couple more minutes in the fryer.  It might be better to ask for your fries well done if you like them crispy.  

Overall it was fairly expensive, not very clean inside, no high chairs or booster seats for the kiddo, very average food, and it's a one and done for me."}
{"text":"This place was BOMB! I don't know why you'd waste your money on smash burger. Generous portions, amazing diff burgers with spices I've never even heard of. You can build a burger as well. Variety. Probably one of the best burger joints around."}
{"text":"All I have to say is yum! Don't ever judge a book by its cover. Our friend recommended this place because he heard it was good. We showed up its empty, one family was sitting and eating. It looks like a Mexican food shop like robertos... Yellow and red not a fan of the colors... Not a fan of the look of it but that's not why I was there. I wanted a burger and a GOOD one! And they delivered a phenomenal burger. My bf and I ordered the A1 burger he added jalapeños and I added guacamole. First bite to last was amazing. I only finished half because they are pretty hearty portions but the next day I toasted it in my oven and tastes just as great! So glad I got to eat the other half AND enjoy it as well. I think their business and great and they deliver. I hoped it was more appealing to the eye but other than that I will come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here Saturday 5pm. 
Hard to find, especially with the construction on Flamingo. Its in the Magoo's bar shopping mall area.

Walked in expecting a fancy burger place, but this isn't it. Its got a diner feeling to it. Large walk in area up to the counter, then a side area for tables and seating. There were 2 other tables occupied.

Only one employee, I guess someone was late showing up, so he was doing all the cooking, cleaning, and order taking. Good job as he managed our table and the two others with charm and efficiency. 

The burgers are huge, and there is a nice selection of choices available. I had the BLT burger and my friend the A1 burger. Both were pretty good, and for a fair price (I think around $8). Drinks come from a giant cooler filled with bottles, and you can get beer if you desire.

I'd come here again. Food was good. I wish they had milkshakes because that's what I like with my burgers. Also the table menu is so small it was hard for me to read the printing."}
{"text":"I've been to The Lab a few times and I still haven't been disappointed.  The burgers, chicken sandwiches, and salsa are all delicious.  A lot of the burgers on the menu are combinations you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else in Vegas -- and the prices are unbeatable!

The restaurant itself is hidden away in a run down strip mall -- the area is nothing special.  It's bigger than it looks.  I'm not sure what all to say.  Our server was great, service was quick, and the food was beyond delicious.  We were seated quickly, given a basket of homemade chips and salsa (delicious), and less than 15 minutes after we placed our order, we had 3 perfectly cooked burgers with steaming hot fries!!

I haven't tried the secret instagram menu (next time!) -- but we all came hungry, and left full.

Seriously, I don't understand all of the complaints about the prices here.   A burger costs just shy of $8.  Including fries, the three of us paid less than $40 for lunch today.  That's unheard of in a town where even a cheap lunch averages $11-12.

Overall, this is a great place to find a delicious and unique burger.  I highly recommend the Bulgogi Burger, boyfriend recommends the Pastrami Burger.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"All the positive reviews are true and still come nowhere close to doing this place justice! Finally stopped in today after living within walking distance for a year and whoa... They're gonna get tired of seeing me, I guarantee it!"}
{"text":"Located in a small strip mall slowly being abandoned by its businesses is a little restaurant that's remarkably easy to overlook. I did for three years. Then one fateful day, my boyfriend brought me to this place and I encountered friendly, attentive staff and the juiciest burgers and carne asada fries known to this side of the Almost-Ghetto. There are quite a few varieties of tasty burger concoctions on the menu but the customer is allowed to create her own as well. I have not done this but the waitress told me there are many examples of customer creations on their Instagram. I will definitely be returning to feast in the future."}
{"text":"My husband loves burger joints and just searched yelp and found this. I was honestly weary walking in because it looks like a hole in the wall but good lord the burgers here are heaven. I got the As burger and my husband got the guacamole burger.  He got the garlic parm fries and I got the onions rings. These are gourmet burgers at fast food prices. PLUS they bring out chips and salsa beforehand and FREE Thrifty ice cream afterwards....what??? We're coming again and with friends!!!!"}
{"text":"The Service was great. We had the cheese, revuelta and cheese and bean pupusas. The size was descent and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely has potential ! If I owned it, I'd have to give it a renovation first off and then inform better regulations as to uniform and hair being tied up. I noticed a blonde lady that had her long hair down and going in and out the kitchen. To me that's just risky business. But besides that, we ordered basically a little bit of everything! And it was all good. The only other complaint i'd have is about the shrimp nachos/ff/tots. We ended up paying $16 just for one order and it did not taste like it was worth that much. Plus, they got he order wrong too. So it can get pricey so just be careful about what you order. And also, there was a long wait time even with no one else there but us..."}
{"text":"I'd rate it a 3.5.

Went in at lunchtime, place was empty.

Asked the waiter for his burger recommendation. After much hesitation, he recommended me the American burger. Pretty boring for a place called \"The Lab.\"

The wait for my food was torturous, as I was on my lunch break. All for a burger which, frankly, was completely forgettable.

However, I'm bumping it up a star because I ordered a pupusa out of curiosity. It was cheap, delicious, and frankly, the best I've had. Like a crisp deep fried dough pocket filled with meat.

Conclusion: skip the burger. Get the pupusa."}
{"text":"Wish could give this 4.5 stars as was quite happy and it is a wonderful little restaurant.

I had one of their burgers, the pastrami one, and it was decadent. They put the chili on the side as wasn't sure if wanted it. Didn't want it as it had ground up beans, and could taste the beans.  The burger, although a little dry for me, had great flavor and very pleased with it!

The cheesy Garlic fries were OK, had good flavor, but was essentially fries with this garlicky cheesy mixture lightly mixed in. Granted, it was good but would've chosen something else.

Another minor thing that helped subtract half a star is they don't have fountain soft drinks, just a minor thing.

Additionally, they prefer cash as charge an additional fifty cents if use a credit card. At first was a little put off, then thought of it as a cash discount.

Want to check this place out again and will recommend it! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the the only few places where the pictures of the burgers and the actual burgers are as tasty as they look. 

When you first walk in you're greeted right away. Their service is great. They do a swell job in explaining the different burgers and which ones they recommend. Through a few minutes of debating on which burger, we decided to get the guac and the pastrami burger. 

The pastrami burger was really hearty and filling. The burger itself looked just as it did in the pictures. The chili was so good! I really wished I tried the chili fries. Overall a very good burger.

My favorite was the guac burger. The guacamole in the burger was perfecto! I'd probably get this every time if I didn't want to try the other burgers. 

They have a big variety of drinks for everyone from juice to Starbucks ice coffee and canned soda. 

I'll definitely be coming back again. Seriously close enough for a short lunch break if you go to unlv. So gooooood!"}
{"text":"I just gotta know who was drunk enough to think of the EL NINO?! haha..substitute the buns for pupusas and add in the veggies that go with it? Come on....my mind was blown. Not only did it sound AH-mazing, but it was ALL THAT!!! I also had an oreo milkshake with two slices of cheesecake topped in it. Wowzer! Service was a bit slow, but I could tell she was new to the serving game so I cut her A LOT of slack, since she was nice and apologetic. Most high end places you don't get that, you're lucky if you get a sincere apology. I had the garlic Parmesan fries and they were ok, nothing special like the rest of my meal. But I will definitely go back for more EL NINO and their shakes. Prices were not bad at all to top it off. Be advised they charge .50 cents if you use your cc and if you're gonna eat in, just choose a chair."}
{"text":"Self-proclaimed best burgers in town and it might be true. The burgers are a tad too big for me but most won't complain about that! Good ingredients, fresh buns, tasty cheese fries (with bacon!), fast and friendly service- they've got the whole package. 

I recommend the A1 burger, with onion rings and bacon (bacon!). My fam ordered the Guac burger (not on the menu) and they  wouldn't share but said they loved it (also with bacon!). 

Convenient location on Eastern and Flamingo with plenty of parking. I'll be back again and again."}
