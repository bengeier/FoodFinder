{"text":"Consistenty good quality food served hot.  Friendly and prompt service.  Breakfasts are great: try the feta omelet with spinach or tomato."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 or 6 times so far. I have been impressed with their service, their food, and the atmosphere. I've never had to wait for a table. At least one or two servers always comes up to our table to make sure we are taken care of. Our food always come out to us at a reasonable time. The prices really can not be beat whatsoever! There sure is a lot to choose from on the menu. Usually I'm always there for breakfast but have had lunch a few times as well. I usually get their eggs and toast and bacon or sausage and I've had their egg salad and another sandwich before as well, along with their soups. All have been excellent! I would definitely recommend this place to those looking for somewhere new to try. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here often and am always impressed with the quality of the food.  If you have never eaten here, you have to give it a try, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This is \"homestyle\" cooking to a tee. In a way its a family restaurant for those who don't have a family. The food here isn't flashy, but its tasty; the portions aren't large, but they aren't skimpy. To put it plainly, stop here if you want a meal like you're Mom's working behind the counter. Its not flashy or impressive, but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Great breakfasts and really good homemade Macedonian Bean soup. Sandwiches are great too!  Love Tom who makes his restaurant welcoming!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The wife and I have been going there for about 7 years.  Its no frills diner food but always good and easy on the pocket.  Check out the chicken vlacki it's the best! Oh and they have super cheap beers which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. First time I've ever been there and it was one of the best meals I've had in awhile. Service was great and staff was very friendly. Portions were a great size for a great price. The owner even came to our table to say hello. I felt like I left with new friends. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The waitress took our order, poured us a cup of coffee, and never returned.  We had to flag down other waitresses to get more coffee, etc.  The meal was average.  When we finally got the bill after asking a number of times - the waitress threw it on the table and walked away.  We won't ever eat there again."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious with a great price. Tom makes you feel welcomed and the waitresses are always friendly and helpful. They can get super packed on the weekends, but the service is fast and yummy. I've never had a bad experience here. The menu is huge so it makes it kind of hard to decide what to get. This is a wonderful family run establishment!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times since we moved to the area in June.  Have stopped for brunch,  dinner & dessert.  Good food, good service, good prices.  Haven't tried the Macedonian coffee yet, did have the kebabs tonight -- definitely a keeper.  Only complaint is the parking situation -- can get tight at times."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat there every week. Not only is the food great, but Tom makes us feel like family. Our kids even love him. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it's all really good. Also, the prices make it an unbeatable value. Go there for lunch or dinner in the spring, and Tom will be outside grilling the food. Not surprised he has been there almost thirty years."}
{"text":"It's a small sign to look for on a busy road to find the restaurant as it's set back a bit, and parking sucks, but it's worth it once you get there. There is no cliche atmosphere to speak of inside...  The food is good. The service is prompt and friendly. We went on a Sunday around 11am, the place was jammed. I was with 3 others, and everything came out perfectly.  It's very dated inside (furniture,  decor), and the prices are great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I come here a lot, the food is great and pretty cheap. Not really room to wait if they are packed and sometimes they're a little slow but I still love the place."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my wife and two year old son. I ordered an omelet and my wife ordered the big breakfast so she could share with our little guy. Plenty of food. Everything was done great and service was really good too. I couldn't believe the low price and had to double check they put everything on the bill. Plan on frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Tommy and his Staff make you feel like your eating in his kitchen at his house. The specials are a great price and the portions never leave me feeling like I need more. The price is right as well - many dinners and sandwiches all under 8.99$. Trust me you can feed a family of 5 for under 45$ bucks plus he can make you breakfast all day...   Truly love this place for all meals!! Go here before any of the chain spots"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price!  The owner, Tom will always make you feel welcome and the service is extremely friendly. The only bad thing is the parking, however that is a small price to pay for the good food!"}
{"text":"Food was above average. I loved the chicken would get it all the time then they started using very small chickens. It looked like a Pigeon or something so small. I complained but I guess it fell on deaf ears so I went elsewhere. Other food I got was OK nothing special. Parking is the worst."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time in a long time.  I ordered the Florentine eggs Benedict.  We had the \"new\" waitress. Which I didn't quite understand why she announced it.  She was very sweet and personable.  I follow a  ketogenic  diet, and asked for no muffins and to add more spinach and a side of bacon and sausage.  They were very accommodating. I'm pretty picky and I guess I had a predisposed opinion of this place like the food wouldn't  be that good.   I was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh and nicely prepared. Plated well. And came out quick.  The new waitress was great too. And put up with me and all my particulars.  I honestly don't see how they put out all the food in that TINY kitchen. Very very shocking.   One thing I don't understand tho, is the obvious focus towards menu items being \"Macedonian\"???  I think it's kind of silly and maybe an explanation would help patrons understand why you are pointing that out. ??   When I had my bakery, I made it a point to explain I cooked and baked from scratch.  But I didn't mention that with all the dishes. Idk.  All in all. It was a reasonable and quick meal and I would try again."}
{"text":"Casual place with both Macedonian and American food in a diner style atmosphere. The Macedonian coffee and baklava are great! I recommend the Macedonian / eastern European dishes like the Macedonian bean soup, chicken vlati sandwich, and chicken paprikash. They have a pretty good bottled beer selection including a Macedonian beer thAt tastes vaguely like Heineken. Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The waitresses are very pretty , friendly, and efficient. Great breakfasts. All kinds of desserts."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. No wait, good friendly service. Excellent soup and sandwiches, reasonable prices. Goofy parking lot tho, be careful backing out"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but the service is not. Basically I go here and order a coffee and will never get a refill even when I'm the only person in the place. I don't know what the staff is doing outside of ignoring me but it seems like I'm not the only one who has this problem. It's not even great coffee or anything but when I come to a diner I expect to be drinking coffee pretty much the whole time. I used to come here a lot but I don't think anymore what with service like this. I don't need much from my waiters I just want my coffee to be filled occasionally but they can't seem to manage it. Oh well."}
{"text":"Been there once and definitely will go back!! I also waited on a girl who is a waitress there and she was so nice! She made me like this place that much more then I already did just because of her bubbly personality"}
{"text":"Very affordable, a large variety of food options to choose from. Quality of food and service always consistent. The highlight of this restaurant is their soups. Always super tasty. Don't forget to try their soups, specially the bean and the cabbage."}
{"text":"The prices are extremely affordable and the food is always delicious. The staff is excellent. I usually go once a week and I've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant after reading so many reviews. It definitely met my expectations and pleased the other diners in my party.   My father, a real critic when it comes to everything, spoke very highly of the Macedonian Bean Soup. He absolutely loved it.  My sister and I, both vegetarians, were pleased with the menu options available to us. We both decided on the Veggie Wrap with potato chips. It was absolutely delicious. I could have easily eaten another wrap, not because I was still hungry, but because it was so good,  The prices are more than fair for the quality of food that we received. For 2 Veggie Wraps, a side of cottage cheese, a root beer, Country Fried steak dinner, and a Steak Lover's sandwich, we paid $28.97. The portions are the right size, not overly large. The servers are very talkative, friendly, and attentive. Definitely worth trying! I will be a return customer."}
{"text":"I ate there today my food was great but I asked my waitress twice for a refill on my coffee. But I see she was busy doing other important things."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant.  Tom the owner is the best. Breakfast specials.  Lunch features.  Mediterranean food. And a nice bar with a patio. Come on in.  Inexpensive.  You can't go wrong. Eggs Benedict every Sunday.  Made Fresh"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were looking for a new breakfast adventure and we stumbled on Village Gardens.  Great, fast service for breakfast, good traditional fare with nice portions.  We went with the \"cars in the parking lot\" meter to help guide us and it didnt fail - great place.  Not much more to share other than we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love the food and service is amazing.  You will never see anyone without a smile on."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere. I had the feta cheese omelette and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Every time I come home from Los Angeles to Ohio I have to stop at this restaurant. The staff is always so friendly and the food is delicious. My favorite dish is the Docs salad with grilled portobello mushrooms. I can't get enough of the mushrooms! The chef, Buddy was so kind to explain to me how he made it so I could have some of that deliciousness back in California! The owner was very sweet and accommodating. I give this restaurant two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Very quaint neighborhood diner. Great for brunch. First time here and I got the garbage plate which was really good. The menu selection was fairly extensive."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but the service is extremely slow. If you have to be somewhere give yourself plenty of time. I think they only have one cook. Can't tell you how the food was because I haven't gotten it   Have been waiting for a half hour so far. Ok. We got our food and everyone in our party was happy with it.  Only complaint was the time it took to get our food. Gravy was great."}
{"text":"This is a great local place for any meal.  I have taken all of my kids here and I can find something for everyone.  The prices are exceptional and the staff is very accommodating. They even serve wine, as they have a quaint little bar in the back. If you have little kids, ask about their kids' meals- they have them, but aren't on the menu, They will take cash, checks & credit cards."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for an excellent value.  Spent about half as much as I would've anywhere else and left extremely satisfied!  Waitress was quick. Food was prepared quick. Drinks were cold. Table was clean. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a toddler. My whole family would come and we were always greeted by Tom. I love the food! The grilled cheese was always a staple for me and I always love picking something out of the dessert case before I leave  I highly recommend. Prices are good and service us great!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years now, and I tell everyone I know to visit whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner. The prices are very reasonable the food is amazing, the staff is great always with a smile and Tom the owner is always a pleasure. Make sure to try the Chicken Vlacki, it is absolutely the best thing ever!!!"}
{"text":"Great omelettes!  Make sure to try the omelettes! There are so many options to choose from, so many combinations. Great little diner, mom-and-pop feel. There's a couple waitresses, and a couple boys cooking in the back, not a big place. You have to wait for a seat to open and grab the table asap. Especially on the weekends, if you plan on going a Saturday morning with the family, I would suggest you either go earlier or later, because right around 10-11:30 it is PACKED and you will not find a table and will be waiting for one. But just the ambiance of this quaint little diner is worth the wait. I just picture a little old woman in the back bossing those boys around and helping them perfect her recipes back there (which I'm sure isn't the case, but I would like to believe so).  The prices are very affordable-just perfect for what you expect. We have only had breakfast here though-have not been for the dinner crowd so I can't elaborate on dinner plates much, other than I've heard good things about dinner as well."}
{"text":"Tom is wonderful and the food is awesome very clean great atmosphere best place in cuyahoga falls for food and hangouts on the weekend"}
{"text":"Good for a quick lunch, nothing special. I came here only because the place I wanted to go was closed on Mondays. Inexpensive and the food is fine. None of the pastries are made in-house. Can't say if they are good or not because I didn't try any. Really, this is a deli-restaurant."}
{"text":"It's nice to get back to the Midwest and have something other than a Cilantro Burrito. Something like Swiss steak.is a very pleasant change and I do enjoy it.  Now if maybe next time I don't forget to get some Baklava for desert."}
{"text":"Tried it for breakfast.  I had blueberry pancakes, my wife had a mushroom omelet with cheese.  The blueberries were very nice, but the pancakes were just about the blandest pancakes I've ever eaten.  I'm not sure how you make pancakes that dull.  My wife said similar about the omelet: nice mushrooms, but the eggs were kind of tasteless.  The coffee was pretty mediocre too.  Staff was nice, though the kitchen was on the slow side for a breakfast place.   Not horrible, might even eat there again if I needed a place to eat, but otherwise won't be back."}
{"text":"Service isn't good. For the half an hour nobody come to refresh our coffee. All waitress were busy talking to each other. We left."}
{"text":"This place only gets one star only because I have to give them at least one. The prices are ok but wait staff can be very unpleasant and the tastes like it has come out of a can. I make homemade sausage gravy and this food is bland bland bland. Do not know why they have such a crowd for breakfast but honestly toco bell would be a better choice! I wouldn't even make my worst enemy eat there!"}
{"text":"Came during lunch time.  Got a \"Tommy Burger\", a double-decker burger which came with fries.  It came out not just well done, but bordering burned. Very bland in flavor (not even much salt added)  It had sauteed onions, yet these were very inconsistently cooked, with some being caramelized, others almost raw.  The fries it came with were a bit bland, but nothing really \"wrong\" with them.  Price was quite cheap at least, about $7 total for double-decker burger, fries, and a drink.    I've heard this place is good for breakfast, so may give it a second shot, to try it's breakfast, but do not have big expectations for it's lunch menu.  In general, a typical American diner type menu."}
{"text":"Refreshing menu choices and great service!  Owner is very friendly and I feel welcome.  Try the chicken paprikash!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based solely on the Yelp and Facebook reviews and it did not let me down!  We took our bridal party there for a rehearsal lunch and the only \"complaint\" I have is that the prices were so low I was worried our friends would think we were cheapskates.  Except the food and service was so amazing - no one cared.  Everyone loved what they had, the waitresses were wonderful and the owner even came out and chatted with us for a while congratulating us on our wedding.  From the soups to the sandwiches to the salads - everything looked awesome and my burger and fries were top notch.  Even my vegetarian friend loved her options and the meal pleased everyone, PLUS it was so inexpensive!!!! I will absolutely go back there again.  I only wish it was closer to Cleveland Heights!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  The food was good.  The service wasn't.  The only thing more cramped than their seating was the parking lot.  They really don't have enough spaces for a restaurant.  You will likely have to park in front of another business and then worry if you're going to get towed.  I can overlook a bad service for good food, but with the parking situation the way it is, I'd sooner just go to one of the other breakfast joints in town."}
{"text":"Yumm breakfast!! Stuffed French toast is to die for! Service is always great everyone is very nice and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Been stopping in here for years. There was a time when if you sat at one certain table near the kitchen, it would wobble when people walked by. Sat there today and it still wobbles, along with a half dozen others that I tried sitting at today. Apparently the problem is spreading. How can they not fix the friggin' floor after all this time? It's like a scene from Jurassic Park when the big dinosaurs walk by. Took 10 minutes for someone to take my order. They were about 1/4 full. Ordered the lasagna special which took a half hour to arrive and was only lukewarm. Coffee tasted like it was from a machine on the turnpike.  From what I've seen the owner is a nice guy and it seems like he's popular with customers. He should reciprocate and upgrade in a few areas.  I love these small non-chain eateries but this place seems to be taking a lot for granted."}
{"text":"I had a chance to go back yesterday. I had an experience that made me feel I needed to update my review. This time around the service was great. Food as well. However, I went to go to the bathroom and had an interesting experience. The way it is set up they do have a mens and women's bathroom. You have to open a door to get to the hall that has the bathrooms. I went to open the door and the door handle came off in my hand. I put it back on. Off in my hands again. I ended up having to turn the little knob mechanism under the handle to get the door to open. When I was leaving the restroom someone who worked there joked. Come off in your hand again? yeah that happens... haha. That's not funny. Thats very dangerous. If it was anyone but me. Someone not stable on their feet, If they pulled the handle with force, they could have fallen backwards into the wall behind that door. They could have hurt themselves badly. They could have, in worst case actually sued the restaurant for injury. That would have been the end of this guys company. Over one single door handle. Its obvious it has happened before. The employee confirmed it happens a lot. It is probably fixed every time, probably quickly and not correctly. My recommendation. Get this fixed. Fast.  Its not a joke. Its not minor. Your life and company are on the line here buddy."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch today.  Initially I expressed some interest in the open face turkey plate, but upon finding out it was luncheon meat turkey, I did a quick pivot and got the dinner special, meatloaf as did the lady. She was caffeine purging today so water for her, I got iced tea, (brewed.) The meatloaf had a nice glaze that had at some point in time been crisp, but the gravy poured atop the dish had sogged the crisp out of it.  It was reasonably flavorful, the gravy struck one as a Durkee powdered variety in origin, but was tolerable. The mashed potatoes were either real or excellent reconstituted flakes, and the \"California\" vegetable medley that every restaurant on the planet imaginitively serves was just as expected but a bit overcooked. Service was quite good and cheerful. The best part was the bill.   With tax it came to a nice round $17.00!!! And I thought 1985 had come and gone!!! When your wallet needs a friend and your tummy needs a meal, this is a grand place to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday at noon- we were seated immediately, served immediately, and after we ordered, it wasn't even 15 minutes before we got our food. The Biscuit Breakfast is the BEST biscuit and sausage gravy I've ever had- perfectly salty and peppery and flavorful. The service was prompt and friendly. And the patio was really nice to sit down at. The prices are very fair, too! 10/10 experience."}
{"text":"We frequent this place for lunch and are always pleased. Excellent soups, great specials and friendly service. They also seem to be very community oriented which is good to see from a local business."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was nice.  Prices were reasonable. That's pretty much all you need in a breakfast place."}
{"text":"M. The meal hit the spot. The potatoes may have been the highlight with everything else falling into ok category. But they did dress it up with some parsley. The price was reasonable and atmosphere was yesterday but I didn't mind because breakfast got served.  D. It was a good breakfast. I ordered my usual 2 eggs over very easy, sausage, home fries, rye toast.  It was all good.  Potatoes had good flavor and crispiness. The sausage had some spice, I don't mean spicy, just good spice flavor,  runny eggs. It came to the table with the right amount of seasoning.  Pleasant."}
{"text":"Man is this place one of my favorites. From the amazing breakfast all the way to the die for dessert. If you haven't been here your crazy. it is a hometown feeling kind of place and very quiet eating adventure. The staff is very nice and very helpful with any questions and enyhting you need. It is a must check out place."}
{"text":"If you want homemade food and leftovers for next day,.. Def check out The Village on State Rd  from a simple BLT to creamy fettuccine with garlic bread and salad.  I've had breakfast and that has never disappointed. The prices are great and owner Tommy is a wonderful owner who greets you and makes you feel welcome."}
