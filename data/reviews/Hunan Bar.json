{"text":"The best authentic Chinese style restaurant I've tried in Pittsburgh! The food is amazing and you get plenty of it in any order. The service is always fast and friendly. Every dish I've tried here always hits the spot. For a restaurant serving Hunan food, I'd say the spice level is very reasonable-very flavorful and hot but the spiciness never take over your palate. My boyfriend and I come here at least once or twice a week since it opened a while back and we've yet to taste anything subpar."}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant is ok, but the service attitude is suck. Especially one waitress in this restaurant, she is so strict and never smile. She looks like my professor Mr. Kolenich because both of them seem to have a bad mood all the time.
If you love Chinese food, I recommend this restaurant to you, but you should better take out. Also, customers cannot choose the amount of tip because they will charge the tip automatically if you pay by card. Anyway, i don't like this restaurant, and i won't go to this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"I'm usually more of a Taiwanese noodles and dumplings type of chinese restaurant-goer, but we had a pretty good experience with this place on our first visit.

All of their dishes seemed pretty authentic for szechuan and hunan food and they have a very large selection of items to choose from.  We were only able to try a few dishes this time, since the portions are really big.  But, we're definitely going to go back and try other things.

Favorite dish so far was:  Spicy Eggplant - good balance of sweet and spicy and the Seafood tofu"}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh as far as I can tell. You wouldn't necessarily know it from the outside (or inside), but this hidden gem serves seriously amazing food. They have a seperate Americanized menu as well but I'd highly recommend the adventurous authentic dishes. The pork belly is now on my list of all-time favorate meals and the chili pot is quite good as well. Don't focus too much on the names of the dishes, most everything is excellent. I have heard from others that the cuban food is great as well, although I have not tried it myself. Service is excellent and the prices are quite fair."}
{"text":"Love this place! You can find really tasty food here, for a better price comparing to others in the area. Some dishes, actually you will not be able to find anywhere else. This is a great place for eating alone, with friends or families, even large get-togethers. Most of time, this place is crowded, so do plan ahead. If you are in a hurry, call in first. Or just be patient, I have seen other customers being very rude to the waitresses. They work very hard, why do we give them such a hard time..."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Amazing food. Lots of non-traditional Asian food to choose from. The beef and ox tripe in a garlic chili sauce had to be in my top 10 foods I have ever eaten. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. The food is here is at least as good, and a nice change, from what we get over in Squirrel Hill. My favorites were eggplant and fish casserole, and beggar's chicken (chicken dry fried in red peppers and sichuan peppercorns). The cumin beef was also solid. 

They have a liquor license which is also a nice change in Pittsburgh. 

As a bonus they had a table next to a fish tank which kept my daughter entertained for  nearly 30 minutes.

We will definitely be back - we are dying to try the Cuban food."}
{"text":"The food tastes not good, both quality and quantity are not fair... price is too high. As a Chinese restaurant, it is so funny that cost higher but eat less. Food just cooked by sauce, lost the taste of food itself. Service is poor."}
{"text":"Hunan Bar certainly gives an authentic Chinese restaurant vibe, with at times good price point for the proportions they provide. But that definitely doesn't meet the quality that one would expect from a four-star restaurant. 

First few strange things I noticed was the shabby furniture and environment, as well as the paper towels you're given instead of napkins. Not only that, the server was consistently trying to get me and my friend to finish our food and leave, and  has given us water that I questioned even came from the tap with its chemical flavor.

As for the food, I ordered one of the ma lat spicy bowls. It definitely had a rich brothy flavor with plenty of toppings. Though other then the amount of food that was in the bowl, the quality of the meat was old and dry and felt like it was hastily put together.

Also I fear for the men who attend the bathroom together using the urinals that are parked only 1ft away from each other without any divider. The hygiene in there is quite questionable.

Overall, I think if you are looking for Chinese food you certainly can find it here, but the quality of the environment, service, and food definitely do meet the standards of a four star restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there several times. Definitely love the self-serviced hot pot. They offer all kinds of meat : fish balls, shrimps, slice of fish, shrimp balls , meat balls, beef balls and all kinds of vegetables! A good place to reunion with some friends and get relaxed after an exam."}
{"text":"Came here once for lunch with a friend and I've been back at least four times! I LOVE THIS PLACE! When I move, this is for sure one of the restaurants that I will miss. The tofu is excellent. The shrimp fried rice is delicious! I love the hunan rice with pork. Everything is so flavorful. I've even bought their egg drop soup by the quart. This place is slightly pricier than most Takeout restaurants but well worth it especially because the portions are pretty sizable! They do have a full bar if you're interested in that as well."}
{"text":"Mapo tofu is one of the best in Pittsburgh. Stair fried pork belly with leeks is also very good. More than half of the entries on menu are spicy but there are also not spicily food. It is not on the menu but on white board, Steamed fish (???) was also very good.

I uploaded photos of menus so we can order pick up by phone."}
{"text":"The food are not genuine Chinese at all, though they are spicy. The service is not good. I won't go there again."}
{"text":"We visited during weekdays and waited for a while before we were told there was a table available. We followed the waitress but she began to talk with other waitresses on the way, and then just WALKED AWAY. We stood there and were not sure what happened. Then some other waitress told us to wait for another 15 mins. We left immediately. They just don't want to give you a large table if you only have a small group. THE WORST EXPERIENCE IN PITTSBURGH EVER."}
{"text":"I was really impressed at the more authentic offerings of Chinese cuisine (particular Hunan and Szechuan).  The interior is very humble but the food is delicious.  We had ordered from the Hunan section of the menu, just beware it is very spicy.  The service was better than I expected from a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"In the first place, there's serious flaws in their service and their sense of hygiene.

Today, I went there and eat hot pot with my friends. In the middle of eating, I found thick  and short men's hair which definitely seems from cook. I hesitated to claim that I found the hair but I decided to do what looks right. So I told them about what I found.

Soon after, one guy who look manager came to me and aggressively asked back \"isn't that your hair?\".  I found it really astonishing that he should be so rude to customer. I didn't mean to cancel order or take out my dishes, etc. Just wanted to warn them so that it will never happen again for other customers.

On top of that, me and my friend's hairs are very long and dyed in bright color, which proves the hair in my food is not from us.  The manager kept being rude. He finally took my dishes off from the bill but took 15% tips without our permission. 

I swear I never go back to this restaurant, ever again. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"my friend and i got the twice cooked pork belly and watercress. both dishes came with rice and were pretty good, relatively standard chinese restaurant dishes!!

good place to go for some authentic tasting chinese food, but the environment did feel a bit grimy and musty."}
{"text":"Ok folks. This is it. Until further notice this is THE BEST Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. 

Yes the prices are a little more than places like Rose Tea or similar. But that's because this is REAL food. My mom teaches Chinese cooking. She grew up in Nanjing and Taipei. I've had the fortune of being treated to lots of good Chinese food through my whole life.

I was able to order beef stomach, pork tongue, and pork intestines ALL FROM ONCE PLACE. And it all tasted fantastic. Incredible!

The food here tastes  just as good as you would expect in ChongChing, Beijing, Flushing, Chicago, or LA. I have moved in all those cities and eaten around. No compromise because it is Pittsburgh. But also the serving sizes are definitely generous. They give rice without charge. The food comes fast. They don't accept American Express. This is legitimate GREAT tasting Chinese food.

I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. It is not so pretty. No gimmicks. Bare bones bathrooms. But that's authentic Chinese at its best.

So come here for wonderful Chinese food. Go somewhere else for alcohol."}
{"text":"As an Asian-American college student, I've been hard pressed to find a really tasty, authentic Chinese restaurant around the Oakland area. Let me start off by saying I think I've found it. Though the exterior of the restaurant doesn't look very grand, you'll be in for a fantastic surprise. 

My group of 4 ordered Fuqi Feipian (Cold, Spicy, Beef Tripe Appetizer), Mustard Greens, Drunken Chicken and Pig's Feet which was a weekly special. All of these dishes with the exception of the Drunken Chicken were absolutely stellar. 

One of the defining characteristics of Hunan Bar that sets it apart from other Asian restaurants is how much kick the spicy dishes have. Most other \"spicy\" dishes are not actually very spicy but the dishes here were hot enough that they made me want to wolf down my rice from a single bite. In general, the portion sizes and prices were also very reasonable. I will definitely be coming back when I'm craving Chinese - it's a shame that I only discovered Hunan Bar my last year of university."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????6????????????????????"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying - I don't like hotpot... usually. Hunan Bar, however, is an exception. I went for their AYCE ($23/person) with a bunch of friends the other day with no expectations. 

The sauce bar they have is limited - but contain the basics: garlic, sesame paste, sha cha paste (I think), soy sauce, vinegar, scallions, and cilantro, which is good enough for me.

The base of the soup had a decent spice level, and I'd say I have higher tolerance for spicy food than most. Personally, I think the flavor of it was better than Shabu Shabu a few blocks down and even comparable to the famous chain Mongolian hot pot, Little Sheep, going around.

The only negative is that they bring out a huge assortment of food and a lot of it goes untouched. The amount of food waste is ridiculous. Next time, lll probably send some back before starting."}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars cuz the food was ok. We ordered hotpot and some drinks. Each of us paid $35. We had some left over we could not finish, when we asked the waitresses for a box to take the left over to go, they didn't allow us to. Also what was really unpleasant was the servers attitude,they looked so unhappy. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"Haven't tried every single Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, but I dare say this is among the top ones. The food here is authentic Chinese style and even better than some restaurants in China. 
I love the fish here sooooo much! And you should gather more four people for dinner so that you can share several kinds of dishes at the same time.
The price is about 15 bucks for a meal on average and that's a little bit expensive for a student without income. So I usually come here when I have something to celebrate or I want to eat fish so badly."}
{"text":"Bubble tea here is pretty decent. However, it was the waitresses that justify this rating. Although it was amusing for me to watch, they usually ended up confusing up the orders and us when we asked for suggestions. Also the Chinese cuisine was pretty eh. I've had better Chinese fare and noodles at other places. They do have a Cuban menu if people are interested in that, although I can't really comment on how good the fare from that menu is."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch there today.  We told our waitress it was our first visit and she could not be more helpful.  We had the shrimp hot pot and the mapo tofu.  Delicious!  Spicy, well seasoned, fresh veggies, large portions. We have lunch for the rest of the week.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers have posted, for AYCE ($23), it doesn't get better than that. It's your mom and pop, the classic Chinatown-esque spot for hot pot. Having been to Chinatown in San Francisco, Boston, and New York, it's not at that level but it will do when you're in Oakland and need something to fill the void. One thing that sucks is that a lot of food is wasted because they bring out pre-set foods to your table. They also serve Cuban food in the front if you're looking to spice up the variety."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new Oakland spot for Chinese food. The food was very authentic and the service was quite good. However, the bathroom downstairs was a shock to me; they didn't even bother to pretend they care about good sanitation. I can totally picture how it's like in their kitchen! I personally don't mind visiting again for the food and service, but won't recommend it to people who are very cautious about sanitation."}
{"text":"One of the better places for Chinese food in the area, in my opinion! Definitely more authentic than a lot of similar places around the Oakland area. Got the chili chicken pot and it had a lot of chicken chunks with a bunch of veggies in a tasty sauce. You can also ask for extra spiciness if feeling adventurous!

I do miss the Cuban food though. I'm not sure exactly when they have it, but last time I was there, we were told that weekend lunch times do not offer the Cuban menu."}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant! Definitely be back again! Nice environment.Great Chinese restaurant! Definitely be back again! Nice environment."}
{"text":"They have pretty good food and treat the clientele different based on whether you are Chinese or not. There was a sign on the counter written in Chinese that if you pay cash, you get 5% off your bill. We paid cash but they didn't give us the discount.

We come here for their hotpot bowls most of the time. These bowls are huge and filling. Personally, it's too flavorful for me and it ends up hurting my throat half way through. I also try not drinking the water that they serve because I'm not sure if they filter it or not and they serve it at room temperature (I guess that I'm used to cold water). I had their other dishes such as the sweet and sour spare ribs and I did enjoy that. 

Overall,  it's an okay restaurant and you need an acquired taste for their food which I like but wouldn't be able to eat it too often. But I would come back!"}
{"text":"Came here to do the AYCE hot pot buffet with my boyfriend, but we couldn't to do it because it's only for groups of 3+. Asked the waitress why it had to be 3+ people and she said that it was because it was a lot of food. I don't know why I would come for AYCE if it wasn't a lot of food.... However, I saw another table of 6 people do AYCE and there was so much wasted food. Hunan Bar really needs to re-do their AYCE and instead of bringing an entire spread out at once, customers should be given a menu with all hot pot items, so they can choose items and reorder as they go. That way small groups can do it and big groups won't waste so much food.

Ultimately, my boyfriend and I did the hot pot combo with half spicy and half white broth. Both broths were good and the ma la broth was flavorful, but a little more greasy than I'm used to. It came with a plate of sliced beef, plate of sliced lamb, 4 shrimp, enoki mushrooms, bok choy, cabbage, tofu, SPAM, and vermicelli. While it was decently filling, the spread was missing a lot of the traditional hot pot stuff I'm accustomed to - fish balls, meat balls, quail eggs, etc. The sauce options covered all the basics with shacha, garlic, chili, cilantro, scallions, soy sauce and vinegar. 

The waitresses were nice, but service was pretty abysmal. I told my boyfriend if he saw any waitresses, to flag them down for more water because we might never see them again. I had to get up several times to find them and ask for things. 

I've definitely had better AYCE hot pot in DC and NYC for the same ~$25 price. They also included a mandatory 15% service fee in the bill. The place was pretty packed though, so maybe stuff other than the hot pot is worth coming for."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Hunan Bar for a non-hot pot meal and, even knowing I loved this place coming in, it exceeded my expectations.  

STEAMED FISH WITH CHOPPED CHILIS: The obligatory order here.  Or, at least it ought to be, as one of the signature dishes of Hunan region.  I wanted just the fish head, but in the absence of its availability, settled for a whole one.  The dish was cooked in much more chili oil than I would have liked--a bit excessive even compared to this dish's usual over-oiliness at typical Hunan places.  But, the result was transcendently tender flesh.  I do not remember the last time I had cooked fish that was textured so perfectly.  The taste of the chili topping was right on as well.  I enjoyed the hell out of this dish.

SWEET & SOUR PORK RIBS:  A favorite of mine, this dish was done magnificently here.  The pork was the perfect amount of chewy (an important texture for this dish cooked authentically), and the sauce was a magical, sweet, sticky elixir that I wanted to drown everything in.  White sesame seeds and scallions on top were icing on the cake.  I could eat this dish every day.

LAMB SOUP:  This was on special, and true to what the server told me, it was nothing but lamb and water, and it was absolutely delicious.  As a lamb lover, I really appreciated the deep flavor of the broth.  The amount of bone-on lamb included was generous too.  This tasted like the ideal of what I would want if I were making it in my home kitchen.

Food-wise, a perfect meal at Hunan Bar.  The only downside was the BAR part.  I came in expecting to order drinks for my birthday and was sorely disappointed.  They had bottled/canned beer and Sutter Home red wine in portion-sized plastic bottles, but that was it.  I couldn't even get a shot of vodka in some bubble tea or something.  Sad sauce.  The bottles behind the bar are apparently \"for show.\"  So, please come here for dinner.  Please definitely don't expect to get your drink on with it.  Order the scary spicy fish.  Man up and eat it."}
{"text":"Food is good and affordable. Back when I was in graduate school, my co-worker and I came here all the time for lunch. Service highly depends on the server. The English-speaking servers are nice and fast and it seems like they are in charge here. I haven't been here for a year so I don't know if the staff has changed. There is an older Chinese lady who can barely speak English but is very sweet. She kept trying to speak Mandarin to me (I can't speak Mandarin, unfortunately) and ordering was almost impossible... I can point at the item I want to order on the menu but how am I supposed to get the idea \"I want it not spicy\" across through body language? Haha. I feel a bit torn about this because as a server she is really not up to par but she needs a job (who doesn't?). A lot of patrons here actually speak Mandarin so she can do her job... just not for me.

Another problem is that one of the younger servers was a bit impatient with my Indian co-worker. My friend doesn't like soy sauce (he claims to have an allergic to soy sauce... of course you can ask if he's allergic to soy sauce how come he goes to a Chinese restaurant? haha). Anyway, he put the order in and specifically asked no soy sauce be added to his dish. The dish came back with soy sauce mixed in so my friend asked that the order be made correctly again. The waitstaff said \"well we are very busy we can't serve you anymore.\" My friend was mad and he ended up talking to the English-speaking server (the manager?). The dish with no soy sauce was finally served. I don't know - perhaps the restaurant was really busy at that time and thus the server did not want to deal with soy sauce issue. 

Overall, service is hit or miss, just like many Chinese restaurants. Other than that, food is pretty good and inexpensive. Good for students on a budget."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've updated this, but Hunan Bar remains one of the only solid places for Chinese food in Oakland, especially after the demise of Taiwan Cafe. I've tried several items that I haven't before, including the hot pot. That is an item worth mentioning, as it is perfect for a wintertime warmup. While a bit pricey, it can easily feed two, and the spiciness and broth will leave you feeling both full and hot.

In the summer, I enjoy coming here during the lunch hours for their smaller lunch items. While this menu is only a subset of their regular one, there are still way too many to choose from. We've taken a liking to some of the tofu dishes, such as with bean sauce or fish, as well as the pork belly. Very good deal for some of those, as they make them pretty authentic."}
{"text":"This place has grown on me over my four years at pitt. A little more expensive than similar locations, but the menu seems more authentic. The mushroom hot pot is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I went to this place twice with a few Chinese friends. It's a great place to have authentic Chinese food in Oakland."}
{"text":"One of the best spicy authentic Chinese food you could find in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: tasty Sichuan food perfect for \"mala\" (numbing) spice lovers. Lunch specials are great value - especially the noodle dishes. One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh for authentic Chinese food.

Hunan Bar is one of my favorite places to go for lunch specials. It's close to many college campuses including CMU, Pitt, and Duquesne, and in a convenient location. There is almost always no wait, and service has been reliably fast every time I've been there. 

As for the food, Hunan is known to be one of the spicier Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. Many Chinese restaurants market themselves as having spicy food, but Hunan's food actually lives up to that expectation. If you're a fan of numbing spice, definitely come here.

Overall, the food is flavorful and has a very authentic flavor to it. Although I'm not a fan of Americanized Chinese food, the food from the non-traditional menu, such as moo goo gai pan, is pretty good. Some of my favorite dishes are the fuqi feipian (sliced beef, tripe, and beef tongue in chili oil), beef and chili pepper, green beans and minced pork, and mapo tofu. I also have to give kudos to Hunan Bar for their generous portions of noodles. I've had the dandan noodles here, and for a low price of a $6.99, they give you a huge bowl that's enough for two meals. Same goes for the zhajiang noodles. Leave it up to Hunan to keep you full for a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Might look a little hole in the wall, but dang the food here is on point. This is where you will find all the asians eating for lunch and dinner because it is authentic. 

Secret: If you want some cheaper food they have a side lunch menu even for dinner. I order the Chow Fun almost all the time. Also, if you like spicy they have side of spicy oil that is the authentic Chinese hot sauce.

Best Chinese food in Oakland with out a doubt. The portions are huge and definitely a place where you should do family style."}
{"text":"Unquestionably the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh, and the best Chinese food that I've had outside of Flushing, NY. Hunan Bar serves American Chinese, Hunan, and Sichuan style dishes (with at least 30 dishes from each cuisine). I ordered the Stir-Fry Pork Belly. It came with green peppers, scallions (cut in a way such that they absorbed the sauce and had a very pleasant flavor), deliciously sweet black beans, and 'hot spicy' red peppers. Both the flavor and spicy of the dish were outstanding. The dish also came with perfectly sticky steamed rice which absorbed the oil from the dish and added another filling yet tasty element to the meal.

In addition to the extensive menu, they have canned soy milk and jelly drinks. I suppose these are helpful in suppressing the spiciness of some of the dishes. (Some of the authentic dishes can probably be prepared very spicy).

Overall, the dishes were more expensive than the other Chinese restaurants in the area, but the quality is superior.

Also, the staff was helpful and friendly. I would rate Hunan Bar 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I was about to get a free swipe into market when a friend called me and told me that they needed a third person to eat all you can eat hot pot.

All you can eat hot pot.

For $20 a person, with a minimum of three people at a table, you can have all you can eat hot pot (on the weekdays--I was told that it's $30 on weekends. Also you can eat 2 people at a table, but you'll be charged for the 3-person price.... I was told by my friends). We ordered a split of half spicy and half plain broth. They set up the single gas burner and came bearing a giant tray (at least 3 feet across), stacked with dishes for us to cook. (Which is how hot pot should work--eaters cook it themselves). 

Among the dishes stacked on top of each other were: sliced beef, sliced lamb, tilapia fillets, shrimp with heads, napa cabbage, bok choy, tripe, 3 different kinds of fish balls, beef meatballs, fried tofu, bean thread, spam, cellophane noodles, mushroom sprouts, daikon, lotus root, and fake crab. All those were AYCE, except for the 10 shrimp.

Especially the lotus root, the ingredients were so uncommon it was a pleasant surprise that they served it. Also the beef and lamb were too fatty for me, but I liked the fish (which was probably frozen). All the vegetables looked and tasted fresh.

The spicy broth was delicious and not too spicy. On the side of the room, there was a small table with 5 different colorful sauces for customers to self serve. I liked the garlic oil sauce. 

There were many waitresses, and around us were larger crowds of 12 people at each round table.

We were there for 2 hours. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Extremely good for Chinese spicy cuisine lover! We drove all the way down from Chicago to Pitt for this Christmas eve meal! Spicy deep fried Chicken is a must! And don't forget take away those dry chill pepper later use them for cooking a spicy dinner like stir fried veggie, It would be good too!"}
{"text":"The waiters there are not polite at all. Usually i don't mind if the waiter is not nice since I think its a hard job to keep up with all the different attitudes that people have. But, here the restaurant was almost empty when I walked in and they took me to a table I didn't like since it was too dark and I was trying to read somethig. I asked for a different table but the server aaid that is at least two. However, when I was leaving most of their tables where occupied by individuals as well as the same table I asked for.

I'm updating this after one year and I decided to increase it to two. The food there is good. Not great but good. But, the waiters are so impolite that I haven't been there anymore since then."}
{"text":"Had hot pot, dishes and Ma La Tang (a spicy bowl of meat of selection with veggies and rice noodle) here. Tried most stuff on the menu. A wide selection of food. Spicy dishes are good in general. Veggies and some plain meat dishes can be a little too plain. Normal dishes deserve a 4 star. Fish, chicken, Gan Guo (Dry pot) are my favorites.

Their hot pot has a huge portion. I mean it is all-you-can-eat. But the starting portion is most likely enough for a person. They also have a wide selection of raw material, which is mostly very fresh. Recommended for large groups if budget is not a problem. Hot pot deserves a five.

Food here is a little over priced, but you can get special dishes generally not available in other restaurants in town. As its name indicates, they are specialized in Hunan cuisine, which is in many ways similar to the spicy Sichuan cuisine. But a wider selection of poultry, different ways of cooking fish and several special dishes makes it a unique place in Pitt. Can be a little crowded during weekends."}
{"text":"This place does both Cuban and Chinese food. Weird, yes I know, but the Cuban is really good. On this occasion I asked the waitress about her favorite dish on the menu. It was the crispy fried tofu with basil mushrooms and something else. The way that she went on and on raving about it I was like ok! Count me in on this dish. When I got it, disgusting. It was not crispy and just loaded with a salty sauce that was overwhelming. I was not thrilled. I didn't even eat the entire dish! And if anyone knows me, that is a pretty big deal. I know that they are trying to get away from Cuban, but I would suggest everyone to stay with that menu not the other one."}
{"text":"We came here mostly because of the appetizing photos of the Chairman Mao's pork belly on Yelp. So that's what we got, along with water spinach and crispy tofu. We noticed that the dishes were pricier than usual, but realized when we got our food that it's because their portions are fairly large in comparison to other Chinese restaurants. Definitely way too much food for two and more appropriate for four (or even five) people. The pork belly was very good (fatty, of course, and therefore delicious) and came with bok choy. Honestly, this one dish should've been enough for the two of us for dinner (hungry but not starving), but it was our first time here so we didn't know portions would be large. The crispy tofu was alright; probably shouldn't have ordered it. The water spinach was a little different in color than usual but taste was standard. Warning: Some of the items on the menu that don't have the spicy sign (such as the crispy tofu) can still be a little spicy, as expected at a Szechuanese restaurant. 

There were rolls of paper towels (instead of napkins?) placed on each table which I found a bit strange. They could also work on their interior more; it seems like all they did was put some photos on the walls and forgot about the rest of the restaurant. 

The two ladies who served us were very friendly and the food is generous in portions and apparently authentic, so I can see how it has some pretty loyal customers.

{"text":"Came here for hot pot! Excellent food and broth, and our waters were refilled very often. They also gave us a lot of tissues, which were much needed. Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I really love this little restaurant, just like eating at home."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD. My friend and I got the hotpot bowls (I got beef and she got fish); they're so good and so worth it!!! A huge bowl of hot broth, filled with a bunch of different veggies, a lot of meat, and noodles! Perfect for a cold Pittsburgh winter day!! Food came out fast, the service was okay, good prices, and it was definitely worth the money. I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. I ordered general tso chicken and he tried to order sweet & sour chicken but was told they were out and they are doing away with the American Chinese because their authentic Chinese is more popular. Next time I will have to try. Their steamed rice is so fluffy and good. Will be back to try the traditional Chinese. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant/bar is situated on Atwood, close to Forbes. It is a combination Cuban and Chinese food restaurant. I had been there before for the Cuban food, which is very good, if you like Cuban please see the reviews for Black Bean. 

Walking into the establishment, you wouldn't think you were going to get an authentic gourmet meal. It is on the second floor of a building that reminds you of a shoddy college apartment interior. The carpet is of the indoor/outdoor variety. The tables and chairs are the kind you would find in a cafeteria. The flat screen TV blares the news or a game show and the lighting is fluorescent. 

However, it is also packed with people speaking Mandarin (good sign). In fact the waitstaff mostly speak Mandarin as well (another good sign). There are Chinese food and Cuban food menus. On the Chinese food menus, you will find classic Sichuan dishes such as Ma Pow tofu and Chong Ching Chicken. There are also dishes that come from other types of Chinese cooking, such as normal Cantonese dishes (broccoli shrimp, cashew chicken) My wife and I had recently been to the Sichuan province (Cheng Du) and deeply enjoyed the food we had there. Usually \"Spicy\" at chinese restaurants just means a subtle kick, but anything labelled \"Spicy\" on the menu here is a SEA of fresh toasted red chilli peppers and sweet firey happiness.  

 A seafood hot pot (prepared in the kitchen) was ordered, it came out in a large bowl absolutely stuffed with vegetables and seafood, made in the non spicy fashion. The broth was homemade and did not taste as though it came from a packet, the seafood was fresh and well prepared. My wife ordered the Ma Pow Tofu. It came out in a pie dish floating in chili oil with freshly grated peppercorns, firm tofu, and mountains of ground pork.  The staff didn't speak great English, but we didn't have trouble communicating and the service was fast and friendly.

We've been to many Sichuan restaurants in the states and this was the most delicious and authentic Sichuan food we've had since visiting Sichuan.  Close your eyes and let your taste buds transport you to the best in asian cuisine.  I can't give it a 5 because once you open your eyes, you'll see that you're still in a run down undecorated dive, but atmosphere aside, the food is as good as you're going to find this side of the Atlantic."}

{"text":"they provide very bad service so I leave 5% tips only. But they took 15% tips out of my credit card. This is fraud. Can anyone tell me how to get the money back?"}
{"text":"Passed by this place on Atwood street but didn't give it a try until my friend highly recommend this place for lunch. I was there for lunch, but there is a bar too if you want to get some drinks. 

They have a well spread lunch menu. I ordered spicy chicken from the lunch menu. It is a lightly fried chicken coated with spicy sauce and cooked along with red and green peppers. It is served with a bowl of steaming hot rice. The quantity and quality are good for the price. It is well cooked and well seasoned chicken. I was very hungry and was able to finish the lunch portion and also it is tasty which made it easier to finish the lunch portion. 

For me this is comfort food that is tasty, served in good quantity and available at a reasonable price. I highly recommend trying this place and I am going back again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE HERE???
It's real Chinese food. Tofu is great, Ma La Tang also great, just like them in Sichuan or in many places in China. A little expensive, but dishes are always huge, so well deserved.
Will come back many times?"}
