{"text":"I went to this restaurant two times over the past two weeks but I have no idea why they still not repairing their air conditioning system. With hot weather in Toronto this summer, I have no mood to eat under such an environment as most dim sum are serving hot. Won't go again until they fixed this problem."}
{"text":"Dim sum is good and service is great. We went there at around 11am and the restaurant was already full but no lineup since most people were already eating. Overall good dim sum even though the chicken feet and squid (both fried and steamed) are not recommended. The pork ribs and har gow are excellent."}
{"text":"I went for weekday dim sum and the food quality is definitely there. 
$1.50 /pp tea charge. The tea is actually decent. (oolong and po lei)

My only apprehension is that portions are small vs price; it's up to you to decide whether or not the added quality is worth it. But definitely give this place a try. 

I can confidently say that all the ordered food items were tasty and no missteps.
BBQ pork bun - I judge a restaurant by this dish. 4.5 stars. 
Goose web, pomelo skin and beancurd - tasty but... small portion
steamed chiu chow dumpling
steamed taro (cake?)
Shrimp spring roll wrapped in rice noodle - tasty play on 'ja leung' (dough stick wrapped in rice noodle)
Mango shrimp roll - this was pretty good. nice crunch from the tempura like batter
Meat Rice dumpling"}
{"text":"Moved to Scarborough about two years now, and was looking for a great restaurant that was clean, great atmosphere and excellent dim sum.  This is the place!  I love that the chairs are covered and comfortable (we usually meet up with family we haven't seen in awhile so there's much catching up to do) and even the dishes are not chipped like in other Chinese restaurants!  Jasmine tea is very fragrant even after refilling the pot 4-5 times.  Great early bird specials and staff very friendly.  You need to get there way before 10am during the weekends so to avoid waiting for a table.  Don't be discouraged by the lack of outdoor parking spaces ...there is plenty underground.  Highly recommend for those serious dim-sum lovers!"}
{"text":"Food is meh to decent.  Service is where they shine.  Tea pots are always filled and food are served timely.  The setting and d√©cor is nice and up scale; unfortunately, your bill will reflect that."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the reviews as I thought this place was quite good and slightly better than other places we've been.

We went to Ginger and Onion before they closed which was terrible.
We went to Dragon Fusion which was better but not amazing.
We went to Fancy Chinese Restaurant which I thought was better than Dragon.
This one I thought was better than Fancy.

We ordered 19 dishes at $3.50 each. We were there at a time when all the dishes of s m l plate size was the cost of a small, or $3.50.

The squid tentacle is a stand out. With this meal, I've had it 3 times here and is the best that I can remember having. I heard the siu ma was homemade and that was very tasty. The pa gow was quite good as well. I recall one dish not being as hot temperature-wise as it should be, but my overall impression was ever-so-slightly better than the places I've been to. We came around 9:40 am on a Sunday and there was no line. Customer service was a little friendlier than other places.

They are very close, like 74, 75, 76 out of 100 but despite other reviews, I think I would come back here. There were more dishes that stood out for being well done and less waiting in lines.

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurant / Dim sum @ Warden/north of Hwy 7

I have been here for dim sum only, so this is a review for their dim sum.  And I will give it an above average 4 star!!  What stands out is it's freshness.  Even the BBQ bun (which is a typical Chinese dim sum dish) came to the table hot and fresh!  Their dumplings are really good as well! (give them a 5-star).  Egg tarts are cute and mini and I like their crispy shells.  Fresh fruit pancake - i have never seen it in any other Chinese restaurant - nice and decent.  

Price: L/M/S all $3 if ordered before 11am. Great price for the quality.  After 11am however, they are not cheap.  A \"large\" dish would cost over $5... a little pricey say for 3 pieces of dumplings.  

Overall, the place is very nice.  Food is decent and above average.  Decor is nice and clean.  Service is good."}
{"text":"We hosted our wedding at Elegance in summer 2013 and we give it a 4.5 star.

We were one of the first to do so and were a little worried about their inexperience being a new restaurant and all. But they were very accommodating throughout the planning process and the wedding banquet was a huge success. 

Food:
The 10 course meal was excellent and and many guests complimented the food. For the first course (roasted pig) the waiters made an entrance with sparklers. They also served it with a modern twist: roasted pig pieces with caesar salad instead of the traditional jellyfish/mayo salad. 

Service: 
Great. We enjoyed dim sum and meet with Ming and Zita many times throughout the wedding planning process. I even requested a decorated photobooth space and they made it happen!
Day of the wedding, there was 1 manager and 2 supervisors on duty.  We had problems with one of the supervisors - watch out for that smooth talking bald dude, he got drunk on our open bar and upset my MIL, he was very unprofessional. 

Otherwise, staff was very friendly and food service was quick and professional.

Decor: 
Pros: Well light with beautiful chandeliers, tall ceilings.
Con: 4 giant brown pillars in the middle of the room. They are quite an eyesore and blocked the stage for some people."}
{"text":"excellent customer service very attentive and friendly. 
we went there for our uncle's birthday; we had a set dinner for 10.  
Everything taste so good and fresh.  We had a great meal and great time.
We loved every single dish from start to the end, we finished everything except the rice and noodles; we were too full so we packed them to go.  oh, our grandma even packed their desserts to go; they were that good.  
We went there before 6 on Sunday, so the parking wasn't that bad yet but when we left at around 9ish... wow, there were a lot of cars outside waiting for parking spots."}
{"text":"Came here for Dim Sum and had a great experience! The food was really fresh and tasted great. This place is also well decorated and is a lot fancier than typical dim sum restaurants. Service was also great! Overall, would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Have not been to Dim Sum in awhile. Elegance service was great topping up our tea and accommodating my group of 9. The portions were tasty and large. Underground parking was a bonus. This venue has to the capacity to handle a couple of hundred people easily. Timing was everything for my friends and family. Cheers Lawrence L."}
{"text":"We are always on the look you a nice Peking Duck, and Elegance didn't dissapoint. Service was very attentive, they didn't fuzz because we didn't have a reservation, even though it was 630pm. We order the Peking Duck (2 courses). It was delicious, and the second course was generous and came with (rice? Potato?) nests which made it very unique. We also order some Har Gow and Sui Mai, even though they arrived last, they were worth the wait. We  can't wait to go back and try other items from their menu."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very friendly host at the front counter and led to our seats, nestled between the main entrance and the wash tubs, accompanied by the cleansing scent of bleach. Between the foot traffic and the constant clashing of cutlery and dishes, we hardly had a chance to hear the increasing grumbling of our stomachs. We spent the next 30 minutes waiting for someone to collect our order, to no avail.

About 45 minutes into our visit, my companion's patience ran out and we flagged down a waiter, whose response I can only describe as confusion mixed with annoyance.

Ironically, the food arrived very quickly once we'd given our order, leaving me to question why it was necessary you ignore us in the first place.

I would like to think it's not relevant to mention that no one in our party was Asian. Then again, I can't reconcile our experience with the high ratings this place has received. 

YMMV."}
{"text":"A friend of my Mom's recommended we try Elegance Cuisine, and I'm so glad we followed her advice! Our previous go-to dim sum place was Dragon Boat Fusion. While I would say the food presentation is nicer at Dragon Boat Fusion, I definitely like the taste of the dim sum here more. This place has a great selection of classic and novel dim sum items that does not disappoint. A good bang for your buck too if you have enough self-discipline to get yourself in here and seated before 11am, during which all small, medium, and large dim sum items are charged the price of a small item (but not the XL/special dim sum items).

There was not a single item we ordered here that we did not enjoy. Their onion pancake thing was spectacular! The bird's nest egg tart, while bougie AF, was incredible--not even so much the pricy bird's nest part, but because of the excellent, creamy custard filling of the egg tart and the airy, flaky crust. Amazing. Best dim sum I have had in North America, and, needless to say, highly recommended."}
{"text":"BUGS IN TEA!!! DONT COME HERE!!! This restaurant has amazing food- every dish they put out is done very well packing a ton of flavor well worth the price. I've been here three times, each time recommending it as a Sunday meet up place for dimsum with friends. for that reason I give this place a 1 star. But be warned- the service completely sucks. the waitstaff has this air to them, as if \"we\" customers need them more than they need us. For this price of dimsum and \"elegance\" they really should be offering exceptional service. (eg. a similar restaurant at time square in Richmond hill would write your last name on the order form so they can address you as Ms/mr so-and- so each time they visited your table).   The last two times I've recommended this restaurant I've been embarrassed because the service was so $hit for the price.  no smile on the waitstaff, their misery is infectious. On the precious Sundays we have to spend time w/ family and friends, dimsum should be a time to laugh over stories and catch up with each other. Nothing kills the vibe faster than snobby waitresses/hostesses/restaurant managers walking around like drones throwing food at your table.

Last time I went with my family, they didn't ask what type of tea we wanted and a brought over a pot of \"teet goon yum\". Customary of dimsum restaurants, Elegance also has a Tea Fee-  I was completely appalled that their staff didn't even ask. That is Dimsum 101. When  we asked for chrysanthemum tea, we found so many BUGS/TICKS STUCK IN ALL THE FLOWERS AND SWIMMING IN THE POT. when we told the waitress, she said it was nothing and said she can take off the tea charge. no apology, nothing.  We showed her a photo of the bugs from an iPhone,  magnified you can clearly see the legs. she called over a manager who told us it was not their fault but pushed the blame to their supplier and told us not to order chrysanthemum tea at restaurants. her answer was COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE- no remorse, complete disregard for public health,  zero intention to stop serving a tea they know that is BUG INFESTED.  they comp'd our meal...but what about all the other tables that was drinking the same bug infested tea?  a comp'd meal is not enough. Had their customer service been on par with the type of clientele they're trying to cater to I would have let the bugs go and not write this on Yelp, but it was one thing after another. I would never come back here, let alone try to convince my family / friends to meet here for Sunday dimsum.

a word of advice to the owner/staff- if you are trying to set higher standards for dimsum in markham, your customer service shouldn't be regressing. Even food courts and food trucks have better service than you."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst dim sum place I've been to in Toronto. 

I was surprised to be seated right away when we arrived around 12. Usually, there's still a wait time at other dim sum restaurants. 

As expected, service was what you'd get at dim sum places. It takes forever to flag someone down for tea, and once the order sheet was submitted, our food took forever.

The turnip cake was still raw inside so I had to send it back and other items we ordered never showed up. Eventually, we just got the bill and GTFO. 

The pastry of the BBQ tart and the egg tart both had a sour taste... so we didn't finish it. It was definitely not fresh.. 

Will I come back? Most certainly not!"}
{"text":"best siu mai and steamed pork ribs in my eyes! Must try .amazing food with fast service. Atmosphere is great ."}
{"text":"Incredible value if you go early in the morning between 9-11 am. All the dim sum is above average. I especially enjoyed the BBQ pork puffs - make sure you try them!"}
{"text":"We always go to Elegance for dim sum but tried their dinner on this occasion.   First , the dim sum is very good - comes out steaming hot.  You order on paper rather than have the rolling cart like some other dim sum restaurants.  Our favorites are the har gow, sui mai, shrimp cheung faan, egg tofu and pea sprouts cheung faan, and the deep fried bean curd with shrimp.  Their jasmine tea is also really good.
Early bird special is from 9-11 am and there is always a line up so come early or be prepared to wait and miss the early bird special.

Now for dinner, not as popular and now I know why?  A little pricey for what you get.  We ordered the Peking duck two ways (but they don't show you the duck in advance), sweet and sour pork, stir fried pea sprouts and garlic, Cantonese chow mein and General Taos chicken, and a mushroom birds nest.  All were good and the jasmine tea they serve is even better during the morning dim sum.  Service was good and attentive and better compared to the morning dim sum rush.

Having tried both, we will stick with the dim sum though! :)"}
{"text":"More higher end Chinese food as you can tell by decor and pricing but I found the quality of food justified that. I tried a couple of a la carte dishes including wok fried scallops and steamed chicken and I really enjoyed the food. Service was attentive. I only tried dinner however.

It is more catered to larger groups as their set meals seem to be great value. Will likely be back as I would like to try their Peking duck and crab dinner set for 6 people at $138. Seems to be a good price and a popular choice for the tables around me."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with coworkers a few weeks back for lunch. We sat at the elevated portion of the restaurant next to the wall. After we finished our meal, I looked down and there was a brown cockroach sitting on my leg! Killed it (see picture) and then we reported it to the manager after who told us that they knew they had this issue and is \"working on it\". He then stepped on the dead cockroach and slid it under the table. Would never come back."}
{"text":"Since moving away from Toronto, my dim sum standards have probably gone downhill. With that said, the dim sum at Elegance was pretty solid and definitely one of the better dim sum experiences i've had in Toronto lately.

As others have mentioned, the service aspect of the restaurant is stellar. Teapots were refilled consistently and dishes were served in a timely manner. Their sweet dishes (steamed custard buns, mango pancake and custard rolls) were also excellent, Pricing seems competitive with some good \"early bird\" specials. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for an event, and was rather impressed with the food and decor. The food was excellent,  but the service was all over the place. I assume same was the result of it being a rather overcrowded event, but it was rather annoying. Hence the 4 of 5 stars. I would like to return here for the food next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I love Elegance for Dim Sum. The food, service and atmosphere were all standouts - the rare trifecta. Another great JK recommendation.

The restaurant looks great and it's spotless. Washrooms were also very clean with a cool modern design. This is the nicest chinese restaurant I ever ate in. Service was top notch and friendly. Prices are higher but worth in in my opinion. Everything was cooked fresh to order. I got excited when I filled out the order card and ordered to much food.  

We enjoyed the following:

- Squid with Curry - Best I ever tried
- Beef in rice noodle - So fresh, also the best I ever tried
- Turnip cake - my fav Dim Sum dish (wrapped with seaweed - a nice touch)
- Chiu chow dumpling - good
- Shrimp dumpling - good
- XO dumpling - not a fan, it had peanuts
- Chive and Mushroom - excellent
- Chicken Feet - Pass thank you
- Onion pancake - Ordered by accident but it was delicious. Filled with green onion, chive and Pork
- Sesame Balls (custard inside) - nice way to end the meal.

The parking in front of the restaurant was completely full but there is free underground parking as well. I arrived on a Saturday at 1pm and it was about 80% full. Got a nice table right away. 

Easily my favourite Dim Sum restaurant in Markham. No brainer - I will be back soon.

{"text":"This place was top notch. I've been to at least 5 other Dim Sum establishments, mostly between Toronto and Etobicoke and some higher end ones. This was the best for service, atmosphere, cleanliness, flavour, quality and selection. It's a bit far from where I live, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for some dim sum with the parents recently, and was pretty impressed at the food and the price. If you put in your order before 10:45am, all SML dim sum is $3, and that's a great price for the quality of food here. Clearly we were hanging with the older crowd (the customer base at the time we were there was essentially old Chinese peeps and a sprinkling of grandkids). We were there on a Friday and it was still pretty full - my parents tell me that it's a ridiculous wait on a weekend. 

We ordered the har gow & siu mai, the steamed veggie dumpling, deep fried shrimp paste on tofu & eggplant, spring rolls, deep fried squid, a rice bowl, and a mango pancake. All the food items were delicious, but my favourites were the squid, siu mai, and veggie dumpling. Sizing was good, and flavour was excellent. The mango pancake is quite nice, and seemed to be a pretty popular item.

Service was good - they kept our tea pots constantly filled, and there were never any stragglers in terms of dishes (though the wait for them seemed to take a bit longer than I'd like). All in all, a good dim sum place that add to the already many options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Came here for a large function and had the set course meal. The interior is quite lovely, with clean furnishings and ample of room for large parties. Food was average for the most part. Lobster was quite delicious though, and service was great for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"We tried Elegance because we our usual place hiked up their prices and we needed a change. Heard this place was more reasonable. They were right! All dishes are $3.20 before 11am, but caution.... lineups start at 10am. We arrived at 10am and had to wait 25 mins for a table for 8.

Dishes were okay-to-good in tastiness. Dishes like 'lo bat go', and 'cheung fun' were smaller than other restaurants. Ie. instead of 3 squares, there were 2, but cut up and spread out across the plate to look like there is more. For the Cheung Fun, there were 2 strips, except they were cut up and placed horizontally so it looked like there was more. Can't fool us! Also, the Cha Siu bao was not steamed well and was basically all broken up and 'melted'. 

We ate until we could roll out, and the bill was considerably lower than our usual place. So, if you're going with a big group of hungry people who wake up early.... this place is decent."}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum places I've been to in a while. If you want to get here before 11am for the $3 special, make sure you wake up early. There is usually a big line up by 10:45am. The food tastes cleaner and fresher than a lot of other places. You can tell that they put into the effort to make the dumpling fillings or pastries in house. Service is typical of other dim sum places. Waving for service is recommended!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed early bird dim sum at the Elegance. Price worked out to about $12 per person all in which means it's at the higher end for the area. Large, \"elegant\" space, good service and food quality. (eg Sam Woo Seafood was $8. per head for early bird a week earlier). Definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood....serious competition for nearby Casa Imperial, Crown Prince or Spring Villa. Elegance would be my current first choice in this area for this price point."}
{"text":"We came here for Dad's birthday dinner tonight and ordered the set dinner which included: 

- Peking duck: the duck was ok, but the dough wrap was dry & thick. 
- seafood and winter melon soup: lots of shrimp & crab meat
- duck with lettuce wrap and fried rice cups. The rice cups were crispy and unique. A different spin on the traditional wrap. 
- beef with Chinese vegetable: was standard
- braised fish with tofu: not that good Steamed with ginger & onion would have been better
- steamed lobster with garlic vermicelli:
 was yum!
- dessert: your standard red bean soup, Chinese jello & cookies

At the price of $148 for set dinner that feeds 6, you can't go wrong. 
However, personally I felt the service and attitude of the wait staff were kinda \"rough around the edges\". Borderline rude.

I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The decor is quite elegant and the service isn't half bad for a Chinese restaurant. The food gets quite pricey if you don't go for the early bird special (be seated and order before 11am). Even the early bird special is a little pricier than most, coming in at $3.20 for each order.

The Lao sa bao (steamed bun with runny, sweet and salty egg yolk) is quite good and I find it quite difficult to find a place with good quality buns. The cheung funs (steamed rice rolls) are decent and comparable to other restaurants. However, what turned this decent rating is the siu mai. This dish arrived towards the end of our meal and I'm glad it did. The siu mai dish had an odd smell that made it seem like either the meat had gone bad or that the fish eggs were not fresh. My brother who was the poor soul, who unknowingly ate it, was sick afterwards.

Not sure if I would return, just due to their prices and \"average\" taste."}
{"text":"The dim sum was good! I especially liked the beef ribs. They were seasoned and cooked just right to be a bit sweet and tender.

I really enjoyed the vermicelli as it was a mixture of glass noodles and vermicelli. It had just enough flavour from the preserved vegetables and the stir-fried chicken strips. I absolutely loved this dish and would return just for it."}
{"text":"Third time here, prices are high compared to some Scarborough restaurants. We came at 1pm on a Sunday so no early bird pricing, but even so, the bill came to $18/person for 6 ppl. 

Although pricey, the quality of the food shines through each dish. Anything that uses puff pastry is so fluffy - you can definitely taste the butter.

The XO turnip cakes are nicely pan-fried, but I wouldn't say it's better than the fried turnip cakes dish from Congee Queen.

When I ordered the pan-fried onion cake \"tainam style,\" I expected a green onion pancake, but it was a onion wrapped pastry type dumpling. Not what I expected. 

The fried dishes aren't too oily and are still crispy after a while, and the har gow and siu mai are huge!

Worth a visit if you want to try a new dim sum place!"}
{"text":"It's new looking and clean-looking.  The service was efficient, and had usual level of (im)politeness as expected in a place like this. 

The food was above average for Dim Sum, and the price was reasonable.

I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"My folks and I decided to try a new venue for dim sum to see what the competition is out there. We came here at 1:30 in the afternoon, and this place is jam packed with people. However, we didn't wait too long for a table and were seated promptly after. 

We ordered some dim sum dishes and waited patiently for it. Not long after the first of our food came out of the kitchen piping hot. The food had good flavours that weren't over powered by MSG. Most of the dishes didn't come out too oily, that's a plus in my books. 

Overall feel of this place is not bad, will come back again when they aren't as busy."}
{"text":"Taste soooooooooooooooooo bad....service so slow.. Food is cold and hard that I told the server,she just go away nothing do for us ."}
{"text":"Exec Summary: nice decor, average food, expensive prices and very good (possibly somewhat intrusive) service.   

Order/Food overview: Spare ribs hot pot, Cantonese Crispy Chow Mein and Tofu with Veggies in oyster sauce. Overall, the food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  However, what annoyed me a bit was that there was no complimentary Chinese soup.  I thought all \"Chinese family restaurants\" served that.  Minus one star for that.  Dessert was pretty cool though because they gave us the standard red bean soup but came with a couple of pastries, a mochi and something that was mix between a cookie and mooncake.  3/5.  

Service: Very good. Even though we had a teapot and all the necessary cutlery, they would keep pouring tea for us, putting plate on our food (even though it was family style) and switching plates. At first it was nice, but then after a while, it got annoying to me. Like I'm trying to talk to my dining companions and a couple of times, they got in the way. In addition, they kept wanting to switch plates even though I wasn't finished with my food.  So I make a mess...leave me alone and let me make my mess in peace :-) 3.5/5

Pricing: This is where it falls apart.  We ordered three very simple dishes and it costs just under $50.  In any other Chinese restaurant, it would have been $25-30. Granted, this is higher class, but almost double is a bit too much for me. 2/5

So would I visit again?  Not for dinner, but maybe for dim sum."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for dim sum and Chinese dinners. The food is fresh and the flavours of the dishes showcases the modern Cantonese cooking style. Dim sum here can be hectic depending on the dining time. When it's busy the dim sum fare may be slightly off and service a bit slow. Dim sum menu is on little sheets and they bring it to you, no carts which is consistent with comparable places. If you've only tried dim sum here you've only experienced half of this restaurant. I've had dinner here many times, casual and banquet style. The set dinners are good pairings, and portions are large. I always enjoy dinner here and never have any problems with the food or service. I've always had excellent service at dinner. We had a dinner party here with two large tables for an anniversary event on the raised stage area and everyone had great things to say about the food.I've also come here for wedding banquets and was also very satisfied. Banquet menu is fabulous, beautiful presentation and service is fast and attentive. Manager is friendly and accommodating and gives you options when selecting the menu items. Washrooms are a bit messy at times but I've seen it on good days as well. Overall great chinese restaurant and option for dim sum, lunch and dinner. This is a ongoing repeat place for me."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dim sum joints! Quality of food is always top notch and food comes out fairly quick. Recommended dishes: siu mai, beef rice roll and baked BBQ bun (sweets section-pineapple baked with BBQ inside). This joint is a bit on the pricey side for dim sum but worth it! There is limited parking however there is an underground parking lot."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal.. Peking Duck melts in your mouth, lobster was cooked well, fish maw soup yummm, everything was great - tofu, mushrooms, veggies..

Corkage was $15 which seems reasonable especially for Canada.

Great food all around, and very good service as well."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of food, cleanliness, prices and even service! Chinese restaurants don't have a reputation for good service - quick service maybe but not friendly service. They give you a dim sum menu when you're waiting for your table so by the time you get seated you've already submitted your order and within minutes it's at the table. Food is hot and fresh and perfectly seasoned. Ask for the hot sauce - it's a little tangy with heat. My mom can't stand spicy foods but she loved the sauce!! Server's were great and came by often to refill our teapot, hot sauce, napkins and even gave my gwai loh hubby a fork even though he doesn't need it LOL definitely will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Okay. Now I'm impressed. My last review still stands for dim sum. This new review is for a lunch set menu. For $35.99, you get a pork rib, corn, and veggie soup, a dish of bitter melon fried with salted egg yolk, a dish of salt and pepper fried squid, lobster e-fu noodles or chow mein, and a red bean pastry with ice cream. It's enough to feed 4 people. 

The soup was tasty, but a tad salty. I liked the dul pok (deep fried tofu pockets?). The corn was very sweet, and there were 4 pieces, so if you come with 4 people, there's enough for everyone! 

I'm a sucker for bitter melon fried with salted egg yolk. This one's pretty good. Decent portion as well.

The squid was super tender, but the portion on this one was a tad off. There were a lot more fried green beans than there were squid pieces, but still tasty. 

The lobster e-fu noodles were delicious. Generous portion. Whole lobster. Fresh. Hot. 

The red bean pastry was crispy and hot. Presentation was surprisingly good. One scoop of ice cream for 4 pieces of red bean pastry, but I'll survive. Amusingly enough, the ice cream was served not on the pastry, but on a piece of skyflake/soda cracker. Vanilla ice cream, for those wondering.

Their manager is lovely. We asked if we could order more than one of these set lunches if we had more people, and he told us to go for it. The sky's the limit!

Tl;dr: Apparently, a lobster lunch is cheaper than dim sum."}
{"text":"This is a nearby dim sum place that I rarely go to and now I see why. The food isn't anything special and many other dim sum places are akin to it. The prices have gone up for quality that has deteriorated. Their service was notably terrible this time, with the assistant manager leading us to our table for morning dim sum, grunting the words \"5 minutes\" with no indication of what she was referring to. We took some time to settle down as the servers set up the table, and as we began selecting from the slip, the same lady came back and said, \"oh you're not done? I'll give you the  green slip (which is more expensive) and you can take all the time you need then\". At this point we were confused. We were just seated because they had just set up our table. She continues, \"I gave you 5 minutes. After 10:40 it's more expensive\". My phone showed 10:37. I showed her this. She snapped and said \"well I'm looking at our computer. Just hurry up\". 

After we put in our order, she came back with the receipt and threw it at our table while rushing by us to serve someone else, as if she was so busy she could not spare a second to provide proper service. 

I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I used to think this dim sum restuarant was expensive compared to other dim sum places in the area. However with the recent price increase with other dim sum places, their price doesn't seem too bad anymore. First of all monday-friday from 9am to 11am, s/m/l is $3.20. On weekends their specials are from 9am to 10:45 am also at $3.20. But the most important thing is this pricing applies even on special holidays such as Chinese New Year. While other dim sum places don't have their dim sum special on public holidays or special days, they have morning specials regardless of holidays or special days. If you come on weekends you will see a long line up outside the restuarant especially if it is a holiday. They have many L dim sum dishes that are actually XL in other restuarants such as fried squid. I think their food is more fresh on weekends than on weekdaya. Portions are big and food usually comes out hot. Tea price is $1.30/person. Decoration is quite nice. Fried food comes out a little slow compared to steam dishes. Taste is mediocre."}

{"text":"They probably cater to old folks because their food is bland. We were there for dim sum and the custard buns we ordered were undercooked. The fried foods tasted like they reuse their oil too. Second time around? No thanks. If you feel the desire to go there for dim sum on a weekend, here's a word of advice...Be there before or at 9:00 AM otherwise good luck with parking outside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a holiday. We tried to call ahead to make a reservation, but they said they don't take reservations for morning tea. They opened at 9:00am, and when we arrived at 9:10 they were almost full, save for a couple of small tables. 

Despite them being full, service was great (tea was refilled very frequently) and the dim sum came out very quickly, steaming hot. The highlights was their spare ribs and the layered sponge cake, cooked to perfection and usually done poorly at other restaurants. 

Their prices on weekends/holidays are $3 per dim sum for small/middle/large, but only until 10:45am. $3 is the regular price for a small. Keep in mind this is a great deal, considering their quality of food and service is stellar!  Their dim sum list is pretty unique and lengthy, so I'll definitely be returning to try some other ones out. Saw a lot of people ordering congee and/or rice, since those were only $3 too, so those might be good as well!

Only issue is that the restaurant itself isn't that large, so if you don't come come to opening time for their $3 dim sum special, you'll be stuck waiting an hour or more for a table!"}
{"text":"Being invited here for Chinese New Year dinner with Jen's family, Elegance Chinese Restaurant is located in the newer Chinese plaza just north of Steeles on Warden Ave.  The name of this place speaks for itself, it's elegant decor, clean ambiance in keeping with the traditional Chinese decor.
Our party had a partitioned off section due to the number of guests in our party.  The service was superb! and their lazy Suzy was the fanciest SUZY I've ever seen.
Service was exceptionally superb and they were fast, efficient and courteous! In terms of food below is list of some of things we tried. (some of which is missing) 

Shitaki Mushroom and vegetables
Crab balls
Roasted duck
Fried Rice
Efu- Noodles
Red bean dessert

Overall it was a great experience, their prices are very reasonable for what you get, along with the service and ambiance.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the heads up Jennifer K.! Came here on a weekday before 11AM.

This place is about quality, service and decors. This is not a $2 all day long dim sum where you just wanna get full and leave. 

This place has value @ $3 per dim sum dish. The service is great, nice waiters and servers. During regular price, it can get quite pricey but you won't go wrong before 11AM. It's order by 11AM and can sit until whenever. My father is a picky eater and he enjoyed it! He works in the field therefore, he rarely says anything taste yummy...LOL

The pumpkin congee was quality and size. It was steaming when it came out and it tasted great..you can taste the puree of the pumpkin that is not from a can!

Most foods are better than average places.

All in All, come before 11AM and you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Elegance after a coworker recommended it to us. We arrived around 10am and waited 20 mins to get seated, which is not too bad for a weekend. There is an early bird special before 11am so it tends to be busy in the mornings. While we waited, we were given a menu to order so that saved us time so when we got seated we put our orders in right away. The service was reasonably fast considering how busy it was, and the food was all very hot and fresh. My favourite items were the har gow, shrimp rice rolls, and the custard buns with egg yolk!!"}
{"text":"We come here with family and friends sometimes. The food is usually pretty good. The restaurant is pretty spacious. It is good for groups and gatherings..."}
{"text":"Im worried that if I write a great review of this place... everyone is going to come.  So, this place is not for you.  It's too good.  You don't want to come here and have great service and probably the best dim sum in the city."}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would recommend for Dim Sum. The main reason is because of the egg custard buns. They are fresh and warm with a warm gooey yolk center. I have tried other egg custard buns but nothing compares to this place. I would also recommend getting their har gow and sui mai. I find that their har gow is not over steamed unlike most places. When you pick it up you'll be able to keep the shrimp inside the wrap, which is surprisingly hard to find. Other items I would recommend are steamed chicken feet and shrimp rice rolls with soya sauce. 

Pros:
- A lot of parking available as they are in a complex, but depending on the time it may get packed 
- beautiful venue that seat many people 

Cons:
- Service could be better. Food can take a while to come home and waiters/waitress can be rude at times"}
{"text":"On Friday night, my family and I ate a multi-course meal at Elegance Chinese Cuisine. This consisted of Peking Duck; Deep Fried Scallops with Broccoli; HK Style Pork Chops with Fried Shrimp Ball, Bell Peppers, and Pineapple; Shark Fin Soup; Roasted Chicken with Shrimp Chips; Saut√©ed Bok Choy with Abalone and Dried Beancurd; Lettuce Wrap (and Vermicelli Shell) with Duck; Tilapia with Vegetables; Saut√©ed Twin Lobster with Ginger and Scallion; Hong Kong Style Sticky Rice; Clear Noodle Soup with Chinese  Broccoli; Sweet Red Bean Soup; and Assorted Chinese Cookies (e.g., almond cookies, sesame cookies).

My favorites were Peking Duck, Deep Fried Scallops with Broccoli, Shark Fin Soup, Saut√©ed Bok Choy with Abalone and Dried Beancurd, and Hong Kong Style Sticky Rice. I liked how the Shark Fin Soup consisted of real shark fin, shrimp,  and cabbage. The Hong Kong Style Sticky Rice was very tasty as it consisted of sticky rice, dried scallop, scallion, egg, chinese sausage, and diced meat (e.g., duck, chicken)."}
{"text":"Elegance Chinese is a pretty nice banquet type restaurant that is seemingly popular for their dim sum. Arrive before 10am if you even want a chance at getting their early bird special (order by 10:45 am). It was just me and my girl, so a table only took about a half hour. Expect longer waits if you're a larger group or get there earlier. The place is rather nice and the service is pretty fast and good. 

I always judge a good dim sum place by their shrimp dumplings and Elegance did a pretty darn good job. The shu mai with scallop was really good too. The shrimp rice rolls were some of the best and they cut it into 4 quarters for you. The sticky rice in lotus leaf come in 3 and taste good with an egg yolk in the middle. Beef tripe and spring rolls were solid, but probably not worth ordering again.

Some of the dishes take quite a long time, but once the first one comes, they all come out rather quickly after the other. The prices are $3.00 per dish if you order before 10:45am. The food is real good and worth the wait."}

{"text":"Came here early for Mother's Day and avoided the line up as we were here at 9am.  If you're here any later (~after 10am) you could expect to wait for a table. Food is quite tasty and the menu contains a lot of the standard dim sum items you would find at any dim sum restaurant; but the atmosphere and environment is much nicer and elegant then most Chinese restaurants"}
{"text":"This place definitely seemed like they were going for a high-end feel. 

I came here for dim sum with the family and was impressed by the selection as well as the quality of the dishes. I did not see the bill but I am confident that it was very pricey compared to other dim sum joints in town.

I personally feel that the environment did not feel very \"classy\" as compared to the mansion house 2 minutes away. It was a wide open space with round tables like your typical yum cha restaurant. 

Service was mediocre and we had to wait a sold 15-20 minute before being seated."}
{"text":"Went there last night to celebrate my moms big birthday with a table of 15 people. 

The restaurant was only a 1/4 full or maybe even less (and on a Friday night close to CNYE too). The service was absolutely abysmal. The staff didn't seem to know what was good on their menu and they originally lost my order that I placed two days prior (for half a suckling pig, Peking duck and pigeons). They eventually found it but had a hard time recommending other items. The waitresses weren't attentive even though they were standing around a lot. Tea pots were left unfilled. Plates with a mountain of bones and shells weren't replaced even though there was a huge stack of clean plates next to where the waitresses were hanging out. We brought our own bottle of champagne and they didn't chill it. The Captain woman was especially rude and lacked customer service on more than one occasion - a week prior she wouldn't help me with the menu and brushed me off to another staff member. Clearly this place doesn't want business and you can tell from the lack of filled tables there at dinner. I don't know about their dim sum as that's what people reviewed on Yelp mostly, but I would not recommend dining here for dinner. 

As for food it was just okay. The suckling pig wasn't oily, but lacked some juicy flavors in it. Was still crispy though. Peking duck was good. They included crispy rice nests along with the lettuce wraps, so that was unique. The pigeon was good.  Fish was fresh. Sweet and sour pork was unique - served in a pineapple bowl of sweet and sour sauce with pork chunks, cantaloupe balls and honeydew balls on skewers. The maggi jumbo shrimps were large but bland. I can't remember what else we ate that was worth mentioning. The birthday lotus buns were good. All Chinese restaurants should stop serving red bean soup though haha... This one was watered down. 

If this place upped their customer service, they might have a fighting chance. Now I know Chinese places are known not to have friendly service all the time, but usually they're still quick and attentive (with a grunt to get you out the door sooner hahaa). This dinner experience was just annoying. Thank God we didn't go with a banquet menu and drop $1000 on this place."}
{"text":"Each time I eat here (mostly due to family obligations) there is always a dish that is unexpectedly well done. Recently had dinner here and there were several impressively innovative spins on the classic Cantonese dishes. 

We ordered the winter melon soup to start and it came in a humongous gold easter egg vessel, with the whole cooked melon holding the actual soup sitting inside. I thought it looked more like an easter egg, but looking back it might have been an approximation of a winter melon since the lid handle was a melon stem complete with a gold leaf. The staff takes care of the serving, scraping the sides of the cooked melon down so there is plenty of melon to be had by all. An impressive way to start a meal.

Another dish was the diced duck that usually comes with lettuce for wrapping. This is usually the afterthought dish after having the peking duck wraps, but they spent the extra effort to make it slightly more interesting. It comes with the usual lettuce, but also some delicate cups of fried rice paper. They were light and crispy, without being greasy. A nice twist on a classic dish.

After so many family dinners in my lifetime, it's nice to find a place that still tries to bring something new to the table."}
{"text":"Absolutely rudest people ever. Don't waste your time, go to Dragon Boat instead. 
Came in for dim sum around 10:40 and we weren't sure if we would make the morning special, which was fine, we wanted to try it out since we were in the area. 
I always like to get a menu and start looking at it to get an idea of what we're going to order. 
One of the bitch hostesses had the audacity to say in Chinese to me, \"you're not looking at the special menu, there's no point\" as she waved in my face. 
If my mother wasn't there with me I would have cussed her out. 
We came to eat, regardless of the special but that was absolutely rude. Won't bother to come back here again if you're gonna speak to me condescendingly in Chinese."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum - it's one of those mark on a sheet to order.

The dim sum here is pretty decent and tasty. It can get a bit pricey, but other reviews say if you come early (before 10:45am) you can get all sizes for the same price. 

Definitely order from the dessert section - they have some pretty unique and tasty options."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the dim sum! Great choices and the service is great. Recommend getting the Steamed Bun with Milk Custard and Egg Yolk. I'm in love with it and cannot find it anywhere else!

- Food: The dim sum here is so good! See below for a list of my favourite things to get. I really recommend the Steak Bun With Milk  Custard and Egg Yolk. It's the main reason I come here, it is so good and I can't find any other place with this bun. 
- Parking: There is tons of parking in the lot and in the parking garage as well. If you get there during the typical breakfast or lunch hour, you may find yourself waiting so get there early!
- Service: The service here is quick which is great if your starving.  
- Spacious: The dining area is huge. Lots of seating and you do not feel crammed at all. 
- Consistency: Food here is very consistent from each time I have come by. 
- Price: The price point here is pretty good. It's great if you go with a lot of people so you can share try lots of new things. 

Foods I liked: 
- Steamed Bun with Milk Custard and Egg Yolk (A MUST HAVE!) 
- Har Gau
- Siu Mai
- Steamed Chicken Feet
- Steamed Beef Tripe 
- Ribs of Veal with Honey Sauce
- Deep Fried Savoury Triangle
- Crispy Deep Fried Squid
- Steamed Rice Roll with Shrimp
- Steamed Rice Roll with Crispy Dough
- Steamed Rice Roll with Minced Beef"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a Sunday morning
Parking is limited at first glance but they also have underground parking
Early bird special is before 10:45am for $3 each dish
Had to wait about 15 minutes for a seat
Service was still excellent even though they were so busy
Food was also very good
My favourites being the mini chicken pot pie and the egg custard bun
I also liked the squid tentacles since they had a nice caramelized glaze and a light crispy to it"}
{"text":"This review is for their lunch dim sum. The quality was so so as some items were kind of bland. The price point was on the higher side but the value didn't quite deliver. I'd stick to their dinner menu."}
{"text":"nice... the early bird price of $3.20 for all sizes S/M/L was a good price.. The Rice Dumpling with egg Yolk is a must eat item. The DimSum restaurant in NYC or Flushing NY cant beat the quality n standard of this restaurant.. its a must visit for all DimSum lovers.. i am a chinese btw so i know my DimSum.. the Siew Mai was amazing... was it real fish roe on top of it??"}
{"text":"I was drawn to this restaurant because I thought the pictures of the food looked so pretty online! I came here on a random weekday morning for the early bird deal. We were instantly...ignored. We stood there for a while and the hostess didn't even greet us. I'm not pleased with this restaurant already. 

We ordered a bunch of food and everything tasted average. Nothing in particular stood out except for the shrimp rice roll. Most dim sum restaurants give you 3 rice roll but here they only give you 2. This isn't a particularly cheap restaurant so I thought that it's quite ridiculous that they would do that.

I wouldn't come back here. For the price point, quality and service, I would rather go somewhere else. A good place to go to is Royale Fine Dining Banquet. The prices are the same, I think, and the service is so much better. I think the dishes are more unique there as well."}
{"text":"Elegance is located in a small plaza just north of steeles on warden. Elegance is part of the Dragon dynasty group along with aromaz. 

This place is always busy. Their early bird special is $3 for small, medium or large. Get here before it even opens at 9 or you will be waiting for a very long time. I got here at 9:10 am once on a Saturday and was told there's 36 tables ahead of me!  

Their service is always prompt, polite and attentive. They always have someone walking around checking to see if you need to hot water for your tea or clear your plates. They would also change your plates for you if they see it half full of bones, leaves or whatnot. Their tone of voice and attitude is just leaps and bounds better than most dim sum places. You hardly have to flag down anyone because there's always someone close by. 

The dim sum at elegance is also pretty solid. The shrimp dumplings here is one of the better ones in toronto. They use shrimps that are larger in size and the dumplings are fairly large. They also have a good variety of congee, steamed dim sum, fried offering a and the desserts aren't too shabby. The mango pancake has nice presentation and it's decent for a dim small place. 

If you come after the specials it's about $15-20 per person so it's not the cheapest but you get what you pay for. 

I have only been here once for dinner and their service is just as good. The food was also very tasty. The lobster had a nice crunch with just enough sauce to coat it. 

I defiantly would recommend coming here. Downside is the tiny parking lot and high traffic coming from elegance, cha time and the medical building."}
{"text":"Octopus tentacles tasted good. Siumai serving is larger than most dimsum places but $5.50 for 4 siumai is expensive. I came in early afternoon and unfortunately the specials are already done. 
There is also \"seating fee\" which is equivalent to what other places charge as tea. So if you sit and not drink tea, you will still get charged? 

The waitress serving us speaks very little English. 

Interior is luxurious, it's more of a fine dining place. 

Nothing special to merit another visit from me."}
{"text":"Love this high-end Chinese resto!

Came here for dinner with a group and had one of those huuuuuge 10 course set meals, with sharks fin, lobster, all that good stuff. Also added a 2 course Peking Duck set.  The Peking Duck was amazing! Everything was soooo good.

Service is friendly and very prompt, and the decor is really bright and classy--unlike the unfriendly and gaudy Casa restaurants.

Can't wait to go back and try their dim sum!"}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum when we were visiting for vacation, the food was amazing, definitely better dimsum here than nyc and there are special discounts if you come in before 10am! there were a ton of varieties of dimsum and we enjoyed all of them!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with my family on a Sunday.  I would recommend making reservations on weekends.  The wait could be long and take up to 30-40 minutes.  The service was what you would expect from a Chinese dim sum restaurant. 

The dim sum are quite good and \"made to order\" so they are hot when they come.  Occasionally, they will carry out some other dishes and offer those. The price is also good."}
{"text":"I would give the dinner food 5/5 stars, everything from the Peking duck to the fish soup, to the lettuce wrap to the crab was all delicious! 

But the servers could really use some work. I don't think a single one of them smiled through the entire dinner, although they were pretty proper-looking. I would rate their service probably a 2.5/5. Sometimes their emotionless face gave me a rude vibe when  I asked for something. This kind of brought the mood down for the dinner. And I was kind of just sitting there enjoying the food instead of enjoying being at their restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum we have had in Markham in a long time!

The dining room lived up to the name and had Elegance, but what really sets Elegance apart is the quality of seafood in their Dim Sum.  From the shrimp in the Har Gow and Cheung Fun, to the mixed seafood in the Congee, to the deep fried squid, the taste and freshness were top notch.

The Siu Mai was delicious with flying fish roe on top as it should be (not Foie Gras - I'm looking at you Crown Princess!) as were the steamed pork ribs.  Chicken and ginger Bao was perfect!

Staff were professional and courteous and managers spoke English, which is really vital when you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin and have to make a special request for something as simple as water instead of tea for a child, or hot sauce, not that the food here needed any extra sauces, it was hot, fresh and tasty, definitely worth the premium prices.  

Living downtown there are a lot of Dim Sum options along Spadina, Dundas and even Gerrard East, but it's all low price and low quality. 

Lately, visits to Markham for Dim Sum were disappointing (Spring Villa, Ginger & Onion, and Grand Lake, to be specific), so it was wonderful to finally find our new go to for quality Dim Sum!

Elegance Chinese Restaurant, please don't ever change, you are worth the drive to Markham!  

*There is evidently underground parking for this mall but while the lot was busy, we didn't need to park underground."}
{"text":"Overall dim sum experience was okay. 

Service was friendly and quick. Place is spacious. We went on a weekday morning before 11am, so there was no wait. All size of dim sum (Small, Medium and Large) are $3.2 from 9-10:55 AM. The price range was toward the expensive side among all the Early Bird Dim Sum specials. 

The dim sum tasted just all right. Nothing outstanding and the portion was pretty small. For the same price range, I would have better option."}
{"text":"After staying within our local dim sum bubble in Mississauga, I felt it was necessary to venture further afield to taste all the foods. We just randomly searched best dim sum in Markham and ended up at Elegance this morning. Thankfully we read a few reviews so we had an idea what was up. We arrived just after 10:15, which to me is early for dim sum but not at this place.  The entrance way was incredibly busy but we managed to get a table within 15 minutes. 

I verified the situation with a waiter who explained that if you get the order in before 10:45, all dishes are $3. We even  placed an order 15 minutes late and they still included it in the deal. Having never been to Elegance, we had no idea the quality or quantity but we're very pleasantly surprised when dishes started showing up. 

I wish I could pick out just a few delicious items, but they were all pretty good. Especially the variety of BBQ pork buns, all perfectly fresh and delicious. I also enjoyed the savory triangles as they were light and crisp rather than super oily like at most places. My boyfriend really enjoyed the fried squid, which we will be ordering double of next time. Lastly, the har gow and siu mai were absolutely epic in size and taste.  Thin wrappers, not thick and doughy like some dim sum restaurants. The wrapping merely acted as a way to corral the shrimp or pork rather than playing a huge texture role in  the bite. 

Other notable aspects of Elegance would be the  cleanliness and the service. The tableware, placed with absolute precision, was absolutely gleaming and spotless. Something I really appreciate. Service was friendly and helpful, even with sometimes minimal English. They always tried their best. 

The only negatives in my mind were that cans of pop were a solid $2 each and that everyone is charged a \"seating charge\". A previous reviewer said that was for the tea. That's fine, we drink the tea. If we hadn't arrived for the early bird special, the meal would have been pretty expensive."}
{"text":"My family just visited the restaurant today and we had the worst restaurant experience ever in our lives. we knew their food is not the best and most of the time the servers and the bosses give customers attitude. today we went back again because the restaurant next to it was full and we were down to this awful restaurant for lunch. we ordered a roasted duck as well as some other dim sum. they gave us a very ugly over-cooked duck that looked almost in complete dark red/black color. it was in-editable, especially we had elderly and young kids in the table. the worst was yet to come. we reported to the server/boss that we cannot take the duck. we didn't even ask for a refund or replacement, we just wanted to let them know this duck was unacceptable. they CANCELLED all of our our remaining orders and gave us the bill. they literally kicked us out of the restaurant!!!!!!!!! please guys, please don't spoil this restaurant and ever go there. if you are in the area, any restaurant is WAY BETTER than this so called elegant restaurant. totally ashame to have a Chinese restaurant in this neighborhood. don't waste your money there and try out how to get traumatized by a restaurant. please, just don't."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of my managers and I am so glad that I listened. The places that we were going to go to, were a bit more pricier than here and the items on the menu were limited. This place was a 6 minute drive away from Pacific Mall, located on Warden. In the same plaza, there's a chat time beside the restaurant and many more restaurants to scope out. A peaking duck restaurant located a couple doors down and a dessert cafe located right across! 

The plaza does have parking but if you do not want any hassle, get there early. I seen signs for underground parking but have no idea where that was. TIP: Do not park near chat time, it was almost impossible to get out with the amount of people parking their cars on the side to pick up their orders at chat time. They really should not be allowed to park there since it is so tight to drive pass and there's suppose to be no parking there, duh! It's a parking lot and that was the aisle! 

Surprisingly, we were seated pretty quickly! I seen previous pictures of people lining up on the door way but almost everyone got seated unless you came in a larger group, it only takes a couple minutes for them to pull a larger round table from the back and set up the table and then everyone is seated. We had 4 adults and two babies. Our friend has to fold their stroller because it was pretty tight and our table was pretty small. When our food came, we had to stack most of the dishes on top of other dishes. 

We kind of got carried away by ordering 2 and 3 of everything which we regretted. Lesson learned, we will always order one of everything next time and then order more later. My favorite dishes was the seafood pancake, the curried cuttlefish, steamed tendon in black sauce and their scallop and snow peas rice roll was just amazing. Everyone at the table loved the steamed tendon but if the appearance does not look appetizing to you, just close your eyes, it was so delicious. It was my boyfriend's favorite. 

The curried cuttlefish was so perfect, I hate ordering this dish because most of the places I go to, they always overcook the cuttlefish and it's usually rubbery but this one melted into your mouth and was fresh tasting! 

We accidentally ordered 3 dishes of squid tentacles forgetting that there was more food to try. However, we did finish all of it. The toddler even agrees, she loved it. Their spring rolls was tasty and the general siu mai and har gow was good too. I wasn't a big fan of their chicken and ginger congee. The chopped bones was throughout the soup and felt grimey, we definitely could not feed the kids the congee because of the bones. 

I thought the food was great aside from the congee. They were pretty accommodating but it was difficult to ask for things like pop or hot sauce. There was one older man with glasses that was simply rude and he didn't hide the fact that he was annoyed with us. The thing is that he kept leaving our table half way through asking requests and give us attitude when we ask for more stuff when he comes back. He would have saved himself the trouble if he has listened the first time. Our table wanted pop at lunch and he had to come to the table three times to get us our drink orders. And he was mad at us when he didn't listen the first time?? That was frustrating. 

The other servers were amazing when they were around and the food was great. We would come back for the amazing food and to try more things on the menu and hope we don't get that man with glasses to serve us.

Sorry forgot to take a picture, we were already hangry before we sat down so when the food came, we all dived right in."}
{"text":"This is our favourite dim sum spot! The service is fast and excellent and the food is just as good. I would recommend coming before 11am to get any size dish (except for XL) for $3.20 each. The restaurant is huge and seats many people, but it does get very busy as many people want the special before 11am. Go earlier if you want to avoid the rush and lineups, especially on weekends!"}
{"text":"If you have read my reviews I'm honest and I'll rate it how I fell it truly deserves. 

I came here for food, I don't care much about the service when it comes to a la carte because you are expecting quality. Everything that I shoved in my mouth was a 10/10 the quality was unbelievable and we ordered a lot of food.

We probably ordered enough to feed 10 people for only 4 people. 

I have only great things to say and you should come try it out and see for yourself

Will come back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I concur w/ some other Yelpers' postings for 2018, my last visit was summer of 2017.  The quality has definitely gone down some.  Management, here is my advice:  watch your oil used inside the kitchen.  It might be something simple, but bad or stale cooking oil is a huge NO NO when it comes to delicate Cantonese food."}
{"text":"I was here for a special Mother's Day buffet event with friends and family. It was a tickets-only event so you had to purchase a ticket prior to the event. At first it was pretty chaotic because there was no traffic management at all. They had a few stations set up for you to fill your plate from: mussels, yee-fun, steamed veggies, steamed yams and taro, bbq ribs and soya chicken, a creamy fruit salad, fried goods like spring rolls or fried veggies, and winter melon soup. The plates you're given are very small and unlike the ones you'd get at a typical buffet restaurant so stacking it up was an issue. Unfortunately, people just piled on whatever they wanted so certain items like chicken or yee-fun were depleted quickly. They try their best to replenish what was missing, but it was not a pleasant experience for those in line, and those sitting near the stations because they had to endure the lines of derriere in their faces as they ate. 

There is an order menu as well as part of the buffet. Each person was entitled to one fried shrimp/crab ball, half a lobster, and a bowl of faux shark-fin soup so it was only up to you on when to order it. Those items were premium and cooked very well. The other order items, like the sweet and sour pork, or veggies were mediocre and a victim to the fast-paced process of the night so it didn't turn out as well. The wait staff worked incredibly hard that night and were vigilant, replenishing tea pots and soft drinks throughout the two hours we were there. 

Dessert options at the end were limited and not good. The cold coconut sago soup would've been good, but they ruined it by adding grapefruit to the concoction. Maybe they were hiding some other off taste, but that acidity mixed with the milk was gosh darn awful. The cakes were dry and factory-processed. The other Chinese desserts like red bean pudding were just okay, nothing to sell your first-born for. 

Overall it was an all-right experience; some aspects were solid while others were poor. More consistency is needed."}

To do Elegance justice, I'd like to round up my review with a dinner tasting.  

The restaurant was about one-third full on a Sunday evening.  Given the price range of the dim sum, I was surprised that dinner entrees started at $14 (vegetable dishes).  We ordered 3 Mushrooms On 4 Vegetables ($14) and Black Peppered Pork on Asparagus ($14).  The portion of the vegetable dish was reasonable, but the meat dish was really small.  Both dishes were impressively not oily, and the ingredients were fresh and of high quality.  The meat dish tasted better than the vegetable dish.  A bowl of rice costed $2, and it was not \"round ball\" full.

Frankly, I think Elegance offers good food.  Dim sum is of impressive quality though small portion.  Dinner is expensive for 2 people.  Bigger group, say 8 people and up, gets a better deal when ordering a set menu.  

Elegance is more of an \"event\" restaurant to me, instead of a routine weekend dining restaurant.

Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I dine here. The food quality had dropped so much. I loved the dim sum here before, but now I have to reconsider. I have a really high expectation when it comes to dim sum. You can call me picky and all. I ordered 5 items and I only ate a 1/3 of the food and packed everything to go. The only consistent thing here is the tea quality. It is still fresh and tasty. Overall, I wouldn't come back here unless I have to. Time to search for a new dim sum  place."}
{"text":"The place is nice! I eat there a lot with my family and the food there is pretty good. Sometimes the meat tastes a little sour though when we order a few dishes, but that's only happened once or twice. Overall the place is reasonably priced and good quality."}
{"text":"All waitresses are dead zombies, no smiles at all. So ruthless, I don't like this place at all. The food is okay, the service is the worst Chinese restaurant in Great Toronto area."}
{"text":"Sad! This dim sum restaurant used to be quite good (about 4 stars) but lately the quality has come down dramatically.

This is a problem with many dim sum restaurants in Richmond Hill / Markham, the chefs eventually leave (or are poached away) and the food quality goes down the drain.

Unfortunately I cannot say I will be returning with my family anytime soon.

Restaurant is clean and well kept though, so that is always nice.

2/5 stars."}
