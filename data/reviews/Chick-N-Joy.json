{"text":"So there's fried chicken and then there's fried chicken written with italics. Unfortunately, this is just fried chicken in a plain font.   I ordered two pieces with fries along with a small gravy. The first piece of chicken I got was fairly minimal in terms of grease and the meat was fairly well cooked (not too much spicing in the batter though). Surprised to find how little of a greasy aftertaste I got from eating it but it wasn't that moist however. The fries are thickcut and pretty decent. The chicken gravy is practically nuclear considering how neon yellow it is but it certainly feels right to have it along for the ride. It would have been a pretty dry meal without it.   That second piece of chicken was greasy though. We are talking KFC levels of grease. It left an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth. I don't really know how consistent they are with their chicken but this just isn't enough to let me entertain the thought of coming back."}
{"text":"Chicken is fantastic!! I would recommend this to a group of friends or family that wanna have a stay in and watch a movie at home. Macaroni salad is delicious, the gravy is nice and thick. Fries are nice a crunchy just how I like it. Please don't compare this place to KFC. Chick-N-Joy is a whole new level. Chicken is never dry, its always fresh. Love the people who work there so nice. Great service, the girl always knows what she's doing."}
{"text":"Very surprised.  Great fries. I mean, fries that you crave. And the chicken is a) cheap and b) delicious.  NOT greasy and actually tastes like chicken. If you are thinking of going to KFC this place beats it by a factor of 10. Clean too. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great local fried chicken joint. The yellow gravy and fries are delicious. If you are in the area give this place a try."}
{"text":"Food is good but the last time I was in the woman taking the orders had a lot of attitude even when we walked in, after awkwardly ordering from her and receiving our food I was a bit annoyed from how loud she was playing her movie on the t.v but no biggie, next I split the mediocre hot sauce on the table thing and asked for for napkins for the three of us, she only gave me one napkin and when I told her there's 3 of us and we spilt sauce she only gave me 3 more, I don't know if they where having a napkin shortage or something but I just wanted to clean the mess we made. So after trying our best and getting like 80% of the sauce in our boxes to throw out says \"Are you guys seriously going to leave that there\" in a very rude tone. 1 its your job to clean up and 2 I asked you twice for more napkins. So what I told her next was not the nicest of words but she definitely deserved it because of the horrible service and disgusting attitude she was giving to paying customers. I hope you are reading this woman who served me because I take great satisfaction in knowing most likely you or that cook cleaned up that mess. would of been 1/5 but the chicken is alright."}
{"text":"my better half and I discovered ChicknJoy simply by accident a few years back (was just walking by) and have been coming here since then regularly.  Great chicken (yeah it's greasy, but it's frickin fried chicken and fries... wadda you expect? duhhh ).  Cash only (which can be irritating at times --- how bout adding debit, boys?)  Best frickin fried chicken east of Yonge .... fast and tasty ...eat it when it's hot and fresh and at its best.  !    May ChicknJoy live forever !!"}
{"text":"My chicken craving solved. I was in the mood for some fried chicken and found myself here.  Ordered a 10pc dark meat only.  Employee said it was cooking and it would be 10 min. Not a problem, I always consider fresh is best. I sat down in the store to eat some for dinner and save the rest for the following days lunch. Knowing it was fresh and hot , I took a couple pieces out to cool .  Once I could safely eat....wow! That was some good chicken.! I will always insist on fresh!"}
{"text":"We ordered the two pc chicken with fries here. The chick is dry and salty, and extremely small. It's like daylight robbery for whatever you have paid.  Never coming back again."}
{"text":"I tell ya, the Queen, east of Greenwood area is a little hotbed of junk food done right. Queen Marg for pizza, Chino Loco for burritos, burgers priest for...burgers of course, and then there's Chick-n-Joy.   a cash only, chicken only place that i just experienced for the first time yesterday, after walking by alot. My GF's Sisters BF and I were loading up on pre UFC snacks, and this was number one on his list.   juicy, flavourful straight up fried chicken, without that synthetic feel you get from the other chicken giants. just plain good in every way.  there's not alot more to say, and people hate on the yellow gravy, but its damm good, and so are the fries.   so, basically, everything you like about KFC, just a little bit fresher, and a independent business.  the girl working the counter was super friendly and nice too, and that always helps."}
{"text":"Cash only! No ATM on site.   That is the reason for the loss of one star. There's no reason in this day and age for any reputable restaurant to be cash only. The other star loss is for the amount of times I have visited this location only to have left with no food. This is due to them having closed early, run out of food, or a combination thereof. It must be a testament to how good their chicken is that they always seem to be completely out, but maybe they need to increase their inventory and keep more than a day's worth on hand. Better to call ahead if you plan on visiting after 4PM to ensure it's not a wasted trip.   Despite what other reviewers have said, I have never had a problem with the customer service (unless I'm being told they're out of chicken). It's usually about a 10-minute wait after you've placed your order, so if you're in a rush, you better set your expectations.  The chicken is DELICIOUS and you'd be a fool for not ordering the yellow gravy (which is an additional charge over the simple piece meals). The medium gravy seems to be the perfect size to dunk the chicken and fries as the small gravy isn't enough and the large is too much."}
{"text":"best fried chicken ever! fries are also very yummy and their gravy is delicious.the chicken is way better than Popeye's and KFC. a must try!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews that people have been banned at this place and having seen the Seinfeld episode of the Soup Natzi, I decided to tread carefully when I ventured into this joint.  To make things easier, I ordered the lunch special which is 2 pieces of fried chicken with fresh cut fries and a pop  to go for 5.95 (without pop the price is $5.35). You could also order one, or two pieces. I also ordered the yellow gravy for $0.85.   The girl at the counter who took my order was polite but not overly warm/friendly. However in spite of the serious demeanour there was a young man there who was scrambling for cash ahead of me and she told him the cost of the 2 piece with fries without a pop comes to $6.05 with tax in an attempt to be helpful.   My order came within 5 mins of waiting and it was handed to me with a \"have a nice day\" from the girl at the counter.  Now to the food - the chicken was crispy and flavourful. There was a sign on the menu board that states you cannot specifically ask for dark or white meat - you get what you get by luck. I got a Thigh and a Breast. Both were quite tasty. Much less greasy than KFC and the better was very light/crunchy. The fries eaten with the yellow sauce are to die for. They were freshly cut and made in house, crispy and chunky without being soggy and greasy. Looooove the fries!!!   I order to go but I wolfed down the whole meal sitting in my car!  I could not wait - I had to eat the fries with the gravy but could not stop until the box was empty.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Despite passing Chick-N-Joy every day for the last 3 years, I never stopped in to get something to eat. What a fool I've been.  I finally stopped in last week to pick up a big box of chicken and fries and a big tub of their neon yellow gravy. Everything was delicious!!  The chicken tasted great. It was nicely fried but not greasy and soggy like KFC can be. The fries were good as well. But it is all about that gravy! Why is the Gravy Yellow? I really don't know..... But I am convinced that the yellow color must be the secret source of its deliciousness and so I am just happy to go along and triple-dip my fries in it, no questions asked.  I know people have complained about the service, but if all you want is to pick up some delicious chicken, fries and gravy then you won't even have time to worry about the rest.  Call ahead because it can take some time as the chicken is prepared fresh. And as another poster noted - bring cash to avoid any troubles with payment."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever and I am happy to see that the chicken and gravy had not changed one bit from when I was a kid.  When I went to school at the nearby Woodfield School., I practically spent all my lunch money at Chick n Joy.  Most time we would try to finish our fries before getting  back to the school so Mr. Nanoff, would steal the fries from us... in a form of hallway tax, if I recall.  While the student special is no longer $1.99, it is still a great place to get a chicken meal at a reasonable price.  The chicken were well seasoned - crispy on the outside and moist inside; the fries were the meaty type, more flavor than crunch; and their gravy still have the hypnotic yellow glow.  Eat it the right way and pour the gravy over the chicken and fries! If the nice lady wasn't sitting next to me at the counter table, I would have licked every drop of the gravy from the box... like I used to.   Nostalgia food do not always live up to its memories. However, Chick and Joy was just as good as I remembered it."}
{"text":"This family run business is an east end staple. I've been eating their fries and yellow gravy since junior high and I can't get enough.   The chicken is moist, not too greasy, and not too salty. The fries are pretty crunchy if you don't have the box closed for too long. The thing that sets them apart is the yellow gravy. It's a must have and it must go an everything. Yellow, artery clogging, goodness at its best.   The only con is that they are cash only-no plastic. I guess it's the price you pay for the mom and pop experience."}
{"text":"Well, a review of what exactly?   The chicken or the service, lol.    The old guy, the owner, John, is great, so friendly, loves the place and the people; love seeing him there.  His kids can be a little less enthusiastic about serving you, but not always. Having said that, the chicken is the best in the city.  The fries are even better.  The chicken gravy, it's yellow, is awesome on the fries.  Their fries are hand-cut, and they could be the best in Toronto.  They're always fresh whenever I get them.  I always get the three-piece dinner, comes with a hot, buttered-roll, so good, and coleslaw.  For the money, it is truly a great deal.   One of my co-workers was banned, so he would get people to go over and get the meal for him, no word of a lie.  It is that good. They close early, so don't go in at seven-thirty and expect fresh chicken, it's hit and miss, depends if they're busy.  Always bring cash.  I like that they take only cash, it's charming, somehow.   Don't ask for dark, you get what you get, which I love.   Occasionally, I'll get the three-piece and there's an extra piece; you just don't know.  I highly recommend going at dinner, the chicken is the freshest then.  Chick enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Note that the hours have changed and Chick-N-Joy is no longer open on Sundays.  I had  the lunch special (available until 3:00 PM): 2 pieces, fries and a drink for $5.95. I also had a small gravy (.85).   The gravy was really good; it is yellow, as others have mentioned, but to me it looks like the typical colour of homemade chicken gravy. The flavour reminded me of the gravy KFC used to have up until the mid-1980s (if you are old enough to remember). It had a nice texture that was neither too thick or thin.  The fries were chunky, fresh-cut, and served unsalted so you can do that to your own taste. They were excellent.  My two pieces of chicken were tasty, but somewhat small. The pieces were around the same size of KFC's pieces, and while Chick-N-Joy doesn't have the black pepper flavour of KFC (I think that is the only one of the original 11 herbs and spices KFC uses nowadays), it did not have the slimy texture of KFC chicken either. It was moist and not overly greasy, but I feel the batter could use more seasoning.   Infinitely better than KFC. The fries and gravy were better than Popeyes, but for the actual chicken, I think I like Popeyes better."}
{"text":"Good tasting food, unlike the rival KFC and their over salted chicken. I've noticed over the year, as they're becoming more and more popular, the proportions (French fries) served get smaller and smaller. Sometimes I would even get undercooked french fries or chicken. Although I've never personally had a bad run in with any of the staff, I've only witnessed, they could be a bit nicer to their customers."}
{"text":"Chick'n'Joy is pretty awesome.  The chicken is fairly good, but what I love most about this place are their fries.    Most places give you crappy processed fries, but these taste awesome, very close to hickory stick chips in taste (a little burnt) and home cut.  The chicken is well-seasoned, tender and not too greasy.  My only desire is that it had more batter.  And the macaroni salad was typical.   Definitely worth it.  Overall, 4 stars"}
{"text":"After years of passing this place, I finally made the decision to try the chicken here based on the reviews i've read on yelp. I've been there 4 times now since my first visit, 2 months ago and has since become my favourite fried chicken 'go to' place in the city!  lucky I don't live in the hood otherwise I'd be tempted to eat there always! I crave chicknjoy almost every week!!!  awesome fries and gravy too...so fresh!  A must try, for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in the city with great chip truck-style fries and wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Always loved the chicken from Chick-N-joy, way better than KFC"}
{"text":"Best. Fried. Chicken.  Best thing in life: Take your combo & eat it on a blanket in Ashbridge's estate under the weeping willow trees.  #winningatlife #getthegravy"}
{"text":"It sure smells like KFC when you get nearer to the Chick, but i guess it should smell like something since it's fried Chicken.  The lunch special is 2 pieces with fries and pop for $5.50 (+tax).  We opted for the 4 piece which gave up white meat, it came with salad and dinner roll. 1 side gravey & 2 pops $13 (included tax).  Better deal.  The chicken is hot and not overcooked, the spice mixture taste a bit like kfc but not as greasy and overpowering.  The homemade fries are in abundance and quite good.  I didn't like the neon yellow gravy it tasted like cornstarch.  The best thing going is the chicken and chips."}
{"text":"First time trying it and the Chicken tasted like plastic and mashed potatoes had no flavor. However the chicken was fresh."}
{"text":"Nostalgrease. I love it. Tastes like how I remember KFC tasted in the 70s. As a bonus they have excellent fries, which IMHO KFC has never had."}
{"text":"Ordered a 3-piece meal and a small gravy for about $9.50 after tax. Came with a rib, a thigh, and a leg: 1 white 2 dark. You cannot request all dark or all white meat. There are no washroom facilities and it's cash only.  The chicken is lightly seasoned. Pieces are very juicy, which makes them better than KFC. In particular, the white meat isn't dry, while KFC white meat is very dry if it's been sitting out for a while. Macaroni salad and a lightly buttered bun were OK. However, what really stands out are the fries and gravy. You get a generous portion of fries. They're thick and were fried very cleanly. The gravy is yellow from the corn flour used and is very flavorful. I dare say these fries and gravy were probably the best I've ever had.  Worth the extra trip, and definitely better than the chain restaurants just for the fries and gravy alone.  EDIT: Have now been here 3 times in the past week. Ordered a 4-piece meal and the young woman said it would take a bit for the next batch. Once it was ready, I was in paradise. The chicken is fantastic when it's just out of the cooker! I've had nothing but great food and great service all 3 times by the young woman, so my rating is up from 4 to 5."}
{"text":"tasted like the chicken and fries you could get from the grocery store. super oily. nothing special. still had that \"out of the freezer\" taste that you don't find at all fast food joints. employee was rude and sassy"}
{"text":"What! I have to wait 8 minutes for fast food!  But it was the best 8 minutes I've ever spent! When I got home the chicken was SOOO crispy on the outside and mmmmm so juicy! It's sooo good when it's fresh out of the fryer.   I usually go to the Pop eyes close to UofT but they make the chickens way before hand and put it under the hot lamps to keep it warm but the often the meat gets chewy.   Had the craving and went back again today but it wasn't fresh out of the fryer so it wasn't that good, however the fries were good this time. But still much better than pop eyes as the storage area is much smaller so more turn around and more fresh chicken.  To get fresh chicken go near the end of dinner time where they constantly make new batches. I just wish there was a way to get freshly fried juicy chicken every time! Maybe make it at home???!?  Food 4.3/5 Service 4.0/5 Ambiance 4.1/5 Value 3.5/5  =========  Overall 4.2/5"}
{"text":"While the food was excellent, and this place has become my new KFC, the establishment itself could use a lot of work. As soon as you enter into the building, there's a small waiting area between the doors and the counter, and does not offer in house seating. I also noticed people whose order #'s had been taken after our own, were being served before us."}
{"text":"Love their chicken...greasy, crunchy skin, well done, moist inside, just like fried chicken should be. Fries are amazing. That said, can only eat here as a treat once a year or so, I mean, it IS fried chicken."}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesday special is 2 pieces of chicken with fries for $3.75 plus taxes.  The order taker was very efficient and service was very fast; under 2 minutes and I had my food walking out the door.  I sat on the outdoor patio of 3 octagon picnic tables with umbrellas.  There are 6 bicycle poles to lock up your ride if you peddled your way here.  Now, first thing I noticed was that the 2 chicken pieces were a healthy size along with a lots of fries.  Second, fries had no salt added.  Is it only me but fries salted immediately after they exit the fryer taste different that ones that sit and then salt is added just before consuming.  The chicken was good and moist...not great.  The fries somewhat soggy (probably waiting under the warming lamps for people that thought 2 minutes out the door was a good sign).  No in this case!  So, overall I would say that the store special is good value and it hits the spot for a light dinner.  I'll return but I can't see my rating ever hitting a four star."}
{"text":"Working late and far from home and i see this place.  The radio says the highway is a mess so its going to be a while until i get home.  I'm hungry.  Why not, lets try it.  I have no idea what to expect but i want chicken.  I walk in and there it is, fried chicken.  Lets try it.  I ordered a 3 pc meal with potato wedges.  It comes with gravy.  Awesome, it smells pretty good.  Well, it tastes as good as it smells.  The chicken was hot, tasty and crispy.  Mmmmmm-fried, one of the fast food groups.  The taters were good too, they were big chunks of potato, battered and deep fried.  They were OK but once you dip 'em in gravy, well now we got our fried on!  This is what i needed to wait out the traffic.  Its a small take out place so I'm sitting in the car, chilling with the radio on, and enjoying some fried chicken.  It was a pretty good way to make the best of what could of been a slow drive home.  My belly is full, the food was good, and I'm ready to take on the 401.  I'm a fan, and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Chick 'n' Joy's recipe is as close to KFC's original recipe without being KFC's original recipe.  A side-by-side comparison:  1.  The chicken is fresh not frozen so there's no smell where the meat meets the bones (unlike KFC).  2.  The pieces are larger than KFC's.  3.  Ample fries with the boxed meals (no 'individual'-sized bagged fries -- why bag the fries when the bag goes into a box anyways?)  4.  Less salty and oily than KFC.  5.  More variety of sides (mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, etc.)  6.  For the most part, cheaper priced than KFC.  Yes, it can get busy during lunch and dinner so there is a little wait but that's a testament to the popularity of this place.  I had the three piece dark meat (rib, thigh, leg) boxed meal for $6.79.  A printable coupon from their website tacked on a free soda and biscuit to my meal.  Nice.   My go-to place for fried chicken from now on."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Scarborough! Get the taters (potato wedges) instead of fries! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food! Less messy and oily than KFC. Only problem is no place to sit!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of old school KFC chicken, to me this is really really similar.  But what is better is that it comes with much better big fluffy crispy fries like you'd get at greasy spoon diners, and a cup-o gravy.  I've never been fans of KFC fries especially when back in the day they used off the shelf McCains fries.  Only issue with this place is there is minimal seating.  No tables and only one rail along the window, so this place is mostly a take-out."}
{"text":"Honestly I tried to like it here. The chicken is okay, the fries are good. But mostly the service is what sucks. In Leslieville were all about supporting local business. But can these people try to make it pleasant? The girl who serves can barely muster up a smile...I've actually never seen her smile. Does it hurt her because it goes against her rock t-shirt image? I don't know. All I know is that I'm not spending my money there anymore for average chicken and sub par service. I may as well go to KFC cuz at least I don't expect anything there."}
{"text":"Loved this place since I was in elementary school. It's been around forever. Best fried chicken, fries and their awesome gravy! Everything is good here!"}
{"text":"Yummiest chicken ever! This place serves the best fried chicken - crispy outside an super juicy inside. The macaroni salad is delicious, if you like mayo. They are always busy but you never have to wait for too much time. Food is always freshly made and service is friendly and super efficient."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed food is rarely ready when ordering the staff sometimes refuse to make you what you want even during the day."}
{"text":"This is a great place for take out chicken and fries.  The place is clean, staff are pleasant, and the service is fast.  Chicken is great, not too greasy (like KFC) and the fries are the best I've had in a while.  It's not over priced like some pretentious small chip shops in the city.  Their slogan is \"Love at first bite\" and I agree."}
{"text":"Usually love their chicken here but have had enough of their bad customer service. Came in to order a 5 pc meal and to add a medium cravy. Was told I can only order a small gravy due to \"logistics\" reason. In story short they were pinching on their gravy because they were only open for another hour. And the attitude on the young lady that serves. She needs to know what real customer service is!"}
{"text":"Great alternative to KFC. Slightly less greasy, and the fries are super fresh. Now that KFC is gone, it is the only greasy chicken choice in the area, and not a bad choice at that.  Staff is nice, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken. Always moist and not too greasy. The yellow gravy is great as well as its not as heavy or greasy than others like KFC or Popeye's. Fries and the coleslaw are excellent."}
{"text":"The service is good but the food leaves something to be desired, actually a lot to be desired.   I ordered the chicken strips and my husband ordered the lunch combo. It just wasn't that good. It was a wait which means it was fresh so that is a good thing right? However, I felt there was no flavour. The fries were soggy and not crispy at all. The biscuit tasted very stale. I must of come at a bad time or something? Not sure if I would brave going again just was very underwhelmed. I really wanted to like it though."}
{"text":"Old school chicken   I go here about once every six weeks. The chicken is always fresh. The batter may not be as flavourfull as some prefer but the chicken is always moist. The gravy has an odd yellow colour but is quite tasty, the fries are good as well, nice size. We always get the 15 piece dinner which, is around 33$ tax in and feeds 3 or 4 people and it comes with fires and choice of salads. We always get the coleslaw, which is very fine and not too creamy. This is not fancy or gourmet in anyway but it is good food. My only complaint is that they should have some kind of role or bread."}
{"text":"Oh the joy of fried chicken! Delicious guilt. Crispy skin , moist, and flavorful. Pair that up with their rustic mash potatoes and savoury thick gravy. I usually add another thigh because I am glutton. :) KFC? No contest. Actually, their macaroni salade is one of a kind. But yea, CHICKEN JOY!! what's crackalackin?!"}
{"text":"Why is your chicken so salty and your fries so soggy. Been in with CNJ in Pickering and Scarborough, but all seems the same."}
{"text":"We went in August during the first week of them opening, and took advantage of the Monday and Tuesday special which was offered every day during their first month being open.  The deal is a good price, and the chicken tastes good! I ordered a buttermilk biscuit as a side, but was a bit disappointed about that, it just wasn't the same consistency or flavor as the biscuits from their other locations. I felt like it was lacking on the buttery aspect of the flavor.  Chicken, as always, very juicy, tasty, big serving, really good!  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is quite a long drive from where I live, but I believe the long drive is so worth it!  I only go during Mondays or Tuesdays when they have their special which is 2 pcs chicken with fries for $3.60  I always make sure to order their buttermilk biscuit, which in my opinion hands down beats Popeye's biscuits. It's got such a milky taste that makes me feel like drooling right now just thinking about it :)  The chicken's a little salty, but the gravy isn't and when they go together, it makes the chicken less salty. This is my number one fried chicken place.. wayyy better than KFC/Popeye's and there is always a long line up when their specials are on.  I am a regular customer and I keep coming back for their juicy chicken and buttermilk biscuits. Definitely looking forward to trying out other stuff from their menu."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken and biscuits ever! I used to prefer Popeyes but after trying this place I was instantly hooked. The chicken portions are larger than Popeyes, the skin is crispier and the seasoning is just perfect. The best part of the meal are their biscuits. They're soft fluffy clouds of buttery goodness. It's more of a yeast based bread than a traditional biscuit - and they're really good the next day for breakfast sandwiches. The owner and employees are great and take a lot of pride in their work. You can tell by the care and attention they take to cook your food and package it."}
{"text":"I've known about Chick-N-Joy for years. I've also been meaning to go, but there's never been one close enough for me to bother taking the time to go. We were driving home today when I saw the signage for this location, so we stopped by to take a look. At 3pm in the afternoon, there were a surprisingly large number of people inside, especially because this is a takeout only place, unless you count three tables outside on the patio.   They have a Monday and Tuesday special that's 2 pieces and fries for $3.60, but they're allowing people to order that every day at that price until Aug 31, 2017. The information for that special is a little confusing to understand, and it's not in very big writing, so there it is. Get it while you can. I got it. The fries are kinda like McDonald's fries, insofar as they're on the limp and mealy side. They're thicker cut though. The chicken is less mealy than KFC's, more crispy, and don't give off that nasty KFC aftertaste. The pieces are of decent size. However, it's not the crispiest fried chicken I've ever had and it's also not the tastiest. It's also slightly salty for my tastes. I've had better chicken for cheaper, so I don't think I'll be intentionally making a stop here, but if I'm in the area and I'm craving chicken, I might come again. They have a mixed bean salad as a side, so that's kinda nice.  Best part of this place is the patio. It seems like a really nice place to just chill out."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years now. I've always been greeted by the girl that a lot of people from other reviews say isn't friendly. She's always been pleasant with me and greets me with a smile.  The chicken is always fresh and hot.  The fries are amazing as is the yellow gravy.   Highly recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Ha ha. Curious about this place because it is in our neighborhood and read so many bad reviews about the \"rude little girl.\" OMG, quit already!  Go back to school, do something worthwhile with your life.  Shame on your parents.  They need to suck it up and hire a sweet teenager who can smile, take orders, collect money, present chicken to customers.  Or sell the place. Food Nazis never survive.  If this chicken is good and my fiancé wants to try it, I won't find it so amusing next time.   15 min update: Just tried it, skin is super nice. Chicken itself, not seasoned. Bland, though good texture. Coleslaw, pass. So, lucky for you, you won't have to deal w/me...food not good enough to justify dealing with your RBF.  To be fair, food is 3.75 stars. But in the restaurant business, when you don't treat your customers properly, your restaurant is and will always be 1 star."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 15 years. The food is crack. It's amazing, the best fried chicken and their yellow gravy is out of this world!!  Completely disregard the negative comments and walk yourself into this joint and grab a 2 piece with gravy, you won't be disappointed.   #teamchicknjoy"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place as my friend and I were out for a cruise. On any given warm day you'd be able to start smelling the chicken from a block away. I've been here around 8 times now and it never disappoints.   If you're looking for customer service this isn't the place to go but if you want great tender chicken at a reasonable price this is definitely the place.  Bite on!"}
{"text":"Good food great wedges. Got the 2 pic special and upgraded fries to wedges for 99c, also like their gravy too"}
{"text":"Better than average Chicken and Fries.  Their sides taste the same as all the other Chicken places.  Not great but okay.  I like CNJ better than KFC, Popeyes or Mary Browns because it isn't over seasoned.  Usually quick service."}
{"text":"came here with a couple of friends and decided to get a family meal, the chicken in my opinion was pretty good, kinda reminded me of KFC but less greasy and cooked much better the skin being crispy not soggy. may come back again but I actually still prefer Popeyes"}
{"text":"As someone who's tried the Ellesmere and Kingston (the one by uoft Scarborough ) as well as the one on Sheppard, I'm pretty well acquainted with chick n joy. So I was super excited to try the chicken despite the reviews.  Fries wise.how are they soggy? They keep making fries but they taste sad with 0 salt or flavour.  Service was nice.  The taters, they don't have that flavour I expect from chick n joy. Usually the flavour closely mimics chicken skin but I just didn't taste that. It was a slight disappointment. At least they are crunchy .  I got the two piece and boy was that drumstick sad AF. Limp, and just not very flavourful. The thigh was a lot better. Compared to.the Ellesmere location, the thigh isn't fully clean (then again most chicken places don't clean it well but Ellesmere location did). Other than that. The thigh was super tasty, not fresh but still delicious and had that taste of chick n joy that I was used to.  Is it a good value for your money ? Eh, yeah I guess. Is it good for the standard chick n joy is typically at? Nope. I'd give this place a 3.5 stars for effort but I'll give a 4 because that's not possible."}
{"text":"I've noticed that the quality of fast food fried chicken joints here (in general) vary depending on store location and time of day.  Reminds me of a greasier, saltier version of KFC original recipe chicken but with a crisper coating. The fries were greasy too. The biscuits were chewy as if they microwaved them a little too long. Coleslaw was a weird green hue (see pic) and the taste just didn't do for me. Saturday afternoons must be a bad day and time.  As far as comparing it to KFC and Popeye's, they are two different flavor profiles (Kentucky Southern Fried Chicken vs Louisiana Cajun Fried Chicken). Different strokes for different folks I say."}
{"text":"NEVER going back there again. Horrible service and had my chicken half cooked... twice. 1st time, there was blood in my fried chicken but I let it go and thought maybe it was a one time thing. 2nd time, same thing and I got food poisoning rally bad. Zero stars!"}
{"text":"I had a very bizarre experience this evening. I order from them fairly often and this time I went in to try to order just gravy (I had some leftovers at home and just wanted gravy to go with it and I really like theirs).  I was told they wouldn't, which I found confusing, since it's up on the menu as a separate item.   Long story short: I did not get upset, but I was confused and I offered to buy a large fries so I could get the gravy and was rudely told they would not sell me anything and asked me to leave.   I'm still baffled by what happened. I've never experienced anything like it."}
{"text":"I just love Chick-n-Joy. I got 12 pieces of chicken, fries, gravy biscuits all for $23.00.  So affordable and the chicken taste like Kfc's old recipe. Even a day old the chicken and biscuits are still edible. This place deserves a five star, the food is great. Not a fancy type restaurant but a hang out quick meal type restaurant."}
{"text":"This is another place we've been going to for many years. And with good reason, we love their stuff. Chicken and fries are always fresh because they never let anything sit around. This is why you may have to wait a while for your order but it's worth it to know you're getting it fresh and hot. The gravy is yellow and delicious and the mac salad is really good. It's a family business so they close for a few weeks in the summer and are not open on holidays. Bring cash, they don't take plastic. Very high on our take home list."}
{"text":"Jolibee favourite fried chicken!  When I'm in town I have to get that juicy deep fried, filipino style goods. The fried chicken can definitely compete with all those other fast food chicken joints if not destroy them b/c of the taste and much more affordable. The crispy seasoned skin with the juicy taste of the meat is amazing and like a traditional filipino what would chicken be without a side of rice! Another big reason I come back here is the hot wings! KFC got rid of their hot wings so now this is the only place that will tame my hot wing craving.  Items to definitely get: - 10 piece for $12.99 - hot wings"}
{"text":"The filipino restaurants are slowly making its way into Canada!   Finally I found another chicken place to rival the infamous KFC and Popeyes, the only difference is that Chick-N-Joy taste alot better to me.   One thing I love about this place is that the chicken is not as salty as KFC and not as oily as Popeyes. If you've had Mary Browns chicken that's how I would compare it to, except that Chick-N-Joy is much cheaper than Mary Browns.   They have a wide variety of items you would find at a chicken joint; sandwiches, nuggets, fingers, chicken pieces, and hot wings. They also have a special deal for every day of the week which is nice instead of your standard toonie tuesday that doesn't even cost a toonie anymore. For sides you have a choice of fries, wedges, and salads, but this is the only place that offers white rice as a side. Its not on the menu but if you ask any of the servers they will give it to you. Overall great chicken join with great food.   Items to definitely get:   - 10 piece dark meat chicken for $10.99  - hot wings  - white rice"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is By FAR Better than all the other mainstream Chicken joints like Popeyes, KFC and etc putting them all in the dust. I had the 6 piece hot wings, classic burger w/ Fries and it all hit the spot for me. I wasn't the biggest fan of the fries I got (very bland) or the burger (bun & toppings) but you don't go to a place like this and start complain about their side options causes your here for ONLY FOR THE CHICKEN and it's very good Chicken at that! Props to them"}
{"text":"I have never had fried chicken that is as moist and tender as the chicken is here. And the fries are to die for...fresh cut and delicious. The gravy also is a one of a k ind and a must have with any meal. All the salads are a perfect mix and so tasty. I never will buy chicken any where else after eating here."}
{"text":"I've lived at the same location for over twenty years and I drive past this place all the time but I've never stopped in before. Tonight, on my way home, I had a craving for wings and it was getting close to closing time for most restaurants in the area. Chick-N-Joy was still open so the timing was good.  I was greeted by a very friendly young lady behind the counter. This place is takeout only. My order took about ten minutes while it was being freshly cooked. I was the last customer of the evening so she gave me a couple of their biscuits and an extra piece of chicken. Nice!  I threw it all on a plate for a quick picture before digging in. It looked good. Mmm, crispy, nice crunch, moist, a little spicy. Cayenne? Nice. The biscuit wasn't what I was expecting but it wasn't bad. I thought it would have been a bit lighter and maybe flakier. It reminded me more of a bread roll meets a Jamaican johhnycake. Not bad. The coleslaw was creamy and nice.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was the comfort food of my childhood... fortunately or maybe unfortunately.  The food here is super greasy and terribly bad for you, but it hits the right spot when you're really hungry.  I like my Chick N Joy way better than KFC because it's not literally dripping with grease, it's hidden away in the crunchiness of the chicken.  Their gravy is one-of-a-kind, that's for sure.  Bright yellow, with black speckles of pepper in it.  The fries are probably one of the best golden fries I've tasted when the oil is fresh and has been changed.  Sometimes though, when the oil hasn't been changed, it's brown and not as crispy.  I also remember enjoying their big juicy burgers, milkshakes and fish and chips.  They do a major renovation on the place every once in a few years, and the place looks very up-to-date.  I'd still take it to-go though, because there isn't much seating."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in the customer service at this location.  We came here at 9:40pm looking to pickup their Monday Special and they refused to make us two orders because they closed at 10pm. They said they could only give us one order because they would need a minimum of 5 orders to start up the fryer again.   We have come here multiple times at 9:55pm and they have gladly served us with no problem in the past.   Highly doubtful I will be returning."}
{"text":"Best fast food fried chicken chain. Not as greasy as KFC. I always get the taters instead of fries with q side of gravy."}
{"text":"I find there food taste horrible staff is great .there were better 15 years ago maybe they could be fresher who knows how long the chicken has been in the warmer"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken burger and I was amazed how big it was. I really enjoyed it, but I didn't like the fries. I waited a long time for my food which I thought was ridiculous. Next time I go I'll try the chicken and maybe get the taters instead."}
{"text":"Forget KFC. End of discussion.   About what was said about the fries, they just need a little help from their gravy. Solid."}
{"text":"Their is nothing really wrong with the service or anything, I just really dont like the food.  The chicken sandwich, fries and gravy i got taste like a plastic/chemical combo. Had to throw it all away.  The chicken pieces itself arent all bad but a bit dry."}
{"text":"I am kind of torn about how to rate this place.  I will never eat here again, and I have had better fried chicken, but none cheaper or closer to my house than that of chick-n-joy.  I feel like I would have liked the ambiance more pre-renovations... I have never been before, but I know in my heart that it used to be cooler.  The good: - the lunch special is dirt cheap.  $4.50 for a 2pc chicken and fries combo with a pop.  - the gravy is spectacular.  Don't be alarmed by it's fluorescent luminescence. - Fries are better than average. - I don't eat a lot of fried chicken (like less than once a year) but this was better than what I remember having from KFC but not as good as a stockyards buttermilk dipped chicken piece (the only fried chicken I will entertain).  The bad: - it was SO greasy.  Seriously.  I have washed my hands twice and I am still greasing my keyboard.  It's extremely disgusting. - no parking. - weird, uncomfortable, sterile, security camera laden environment with just a handful of counter seats. - weird display case full of \"stuff\" you can purchase at the store above the fried chicken place.  By \"stuff\" I mean weird random junk (like a bread shaped dish sponge or a plastic-masquerading-as-wood doorstop).  Would I ever go here again? Never.  I don't eat food THIS greasy except for McDonalds breakfast.  It wasn't that bad, I just wasn't into it.  Cash only."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks very clean. The plaza that it is located in has been renovated and looks a thousand times better than it did previously. It contains limited seating inside; also it has separate in and out doors which seem rather annoying to me. As for the food it was disgusting and I'll never eat chicken and joy again."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a decent review if not for the EXTREMELY RUDE service that I faced. I was a regular there till one day when I called the store at 7:45PM and asked for a small order and they said that they could only do a minimum of 9 pieces as the machine takes no less than that. Since they were not willing to reduce the order, I called a friend and asked if she would share and she said yes. I called back 2 mins later and they said they couldn't do the order as they need 15 mins and I was calling at 7:47! But this is not where it ends. John picked up the phone and started blasting at me, and when I said that I was a loyal customer he had the audacity to say \"so it's only about the customer, what about me?\" and said some other condescending things and hung up the phone. I have never faced such treatment from a restaurant, that too an owner before. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Why would anyone ever go anywhere else for fried chicken in the city?  Perfect for impromptu picnic in the Beaches (especially when it's minus 8 and snowing).  The Chicken: crispy, juicy, perfectly cooked.  Practically perfect, nothing left to say.  The Sides:  Fries: Really yummy, fresh, thick cut fries.  Gravy: shocking yellow colour, but get it, it is homemade and delicious. Macaroni Salad: a really good, traditional mayo-based macaroni salad crunchy green onion and celery bits. Potato salad: nice balance creamy and tang.  I haven't tried to coleslaw or the mixed bean salad.  Hot Sauce: I wouldn't call it hot, more like a thin \"chili sauce\". But it is still really nice, I like dipping fries into it instead of ketchup.   Call ahead for orders larger than 8 pieces, the wait can be over 20 minutes. Closed on Sunday"}
{"text":"Chicken is fantastic?so crispy?much spice inside. No blood left in the chicken like KFC and popeyes."}
{"text":"loved it! I've always heard rave reviews about Chick N Joy, but never had one close by, we finally got a family meal from here and i am super impressed. It far surpasses KFC in every way (except macaroni salad) it's cheaper than KFC, the chicken is crispier and tastier, and far less greasy, no greasy hands or greasy packaging. Tried taters instead of fries, they are excellent. The salads are just ok, i prefer the ones from KFC, but that's barely an issue! I love that they have biscuits. I will never need another fried chicken place again."}
{"text":"My wife doesn't eat fried chicken. She was away one weekend so I decided to splurge and drink some beer and eat some chicken. I grew up eating the 2nie Tuesday deals here as I went to high school not too far from here. I'm a leg and thigh guy but seeing how I'm older I thought I should healthy it up so I got a bucket with breasts.  Fries and gravy are a must here. The fries are amazing. I ended up with way too much food for a single person but eh price was right. I ended up eating most of the bucket and drinking some beers, which I conveniently picked up next door. The meal was epic and the chicken and fries were just as good as I remembered eating 15+ years ago.   Skip the colonel and the Louisiana chicken spot and eat here. You won't regret it....unless you eat the good part of a bucket and over do it like said reviewer."}
{"text":"Omg! This chicken was absolutely amazing! I'm here from the states and this is by far the best I've had here. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it wasn't as hot and fresh as I would have liked. And oh, the fries are really good! They were hot and fresh. They give you gravy for the fries but I'm a ketchup kinda guy! I will definitely be returning. After a week of craving chicken... this place really satisfied me!"}
{"text":"Nasty food.. sometimes I buy food here for my dog. I don't know how they still open, I don't see much people go there"}
{"text":"They usually close earlier than their stated closing time but these are hands down the best friend chicken i ever had. Looks like KFC but tastes like quality. Also, the radioactive looking gravy is pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"Great fried Chicken but NO INTERAC!!!  C'mon..  It's 2015!!!!  Can you at least a bank machine close by???"}
