{"text":"wow, been very impressive with the building, great location (center of Montreal) side to a mall,  subway access, service etc etc. beware wifi is extra. got facilities to pool and gym, room service is very efficient and rapid. got a blast... will be back for sure"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Montreal Intercontinental after researching hotels for about a year. We heard that this would be a wonderful place to spend our 25th Anniversary.  We were surprised to find that while the staff was trying their best, they are extremely understaffed and it took 3 long days to have them clean the disgusting black mold in our shower and in our coffee maker after repeated requests. Photos attached.  Another big disappointment has been the fact that we completed BOTH the \"after your stay\" questionnaire  3 days after our trip last week in Aug. and then when no response after 11 days, I phoned customer service number, was told \"we are all backed -up\", send info to this other email and guess what??? Nothing still. It has been a total of 3 weeks.  Guess IGH does not care... Try other hotels..."}
{"text":"This is probably a great business hotel.  It's not great for tourists.  The room was very nice, but the atmosphere of the place was cold and sterile.  When we arrived around 8 p.m., there was no one at the bell hop station.  You had to go up the escalator to get to the front desk.  There were no brochures or suggestions of what to do in Montreal in the lobby or on offer at the front desk.  We told the receptionist we had never been to the city before and we still got few suggestions, even though the concierage was standing right next to her.  Not very welcoming.  Also, we didn't find any breakfast anywhere!  Couldn't even get more than one cup of coffee in our room!"}
{"text":"We booked this hotel on hotwire, and we were pleasantly surprised! The room was clean and large, and the bed was super comfortable. Valet parking was not too expensive, and the staff were all extremely helpful. We asked where a good place for breakfast was one morning, and the concierge walked with us a little ways and pointed us in the direction of the most perfect little French cafe. I would absolutely return to this hotel, and recommend it to anyone traveling to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This hotel was arranged for us by Holland cruise line. It is centrally located...closer to old town, has an indoor pool, spa, sauna, and exercise room with a few machines. Our room was amazing...large with a beautiful bath with a tub and shower...very roomy. Internet is available for free in the lobby but if you join their club, no free to join, the Internet will also be free in your room. It is a beautiful hotel (which by the way doesn't look like from the outside). Don't expect a magnificent view from the window...but who cares. The hop on hop off bus is a couple of blocks away. All the people who work here are very helpful and friendly. We did not have extra fees."}
{"text":"The location is excellent, the hotel is near some great restaurants and sites in Montreal, it even has an indoor shopping area attached with a Starbucks and bagel place. However, some of the staff I encountered  were unfriendly, don't seem to care, and act like they are doing you a favor by answering a simple question.  Even at check in, I was provided with no information on the check out time, the breakfast times and had to come back to ask further questions - yes that sometimes  happens, but it's consistent with the overall experience. The lobby is nice, but the actual rooms while they are a good size, are outdated and dusty. I could also see grout/mold growing in the shower. I also found a lot of dust under the bed and had terrible allergies all night. If you use the self-serve parking option for $25 per day, you don't get in and out privileges without a fee.  It's also three elevators to get to the intercontinental parking area which we managed to figure out with the very vague instructions we received at check in. I purchased my stay through Expedia, and got the breakfast buffet included with the price. When I went by in the morning to check  out the breakfast buffet, it was very busy. Granted it was labour day weekend so a line up is expected; but when I asked the hostess if I could see the buffet ( that I had already paid for) to decide if it was worth waiting in line, she told me to \"make sure I came back since there was a waiting list\" - like I was going to sneak in and sit at an already occupied table and hope no one noticed, to eat a breakfast I already paid for?  That was a terrible way to speak to a paying hotel guest.  My husband and I ended up forgoing the breakfast and ate somewhere else. Overall this is a 3 star hotel at the most, operating under a 4 star brand. I have traveled frequently for both pleasure and business, and this hotel has a lot of room for improvement. There are plenty of other hotels in the area or right in old Montreal, so next time I will be looking at other options.  This hotel has a lot of potential,  and was probably was really nice about ten years ago, but going forward this will be a pass."}
{"text":"This hotel is dirty. Carpets in the hallways are littered with visible dirt debris, the furniture in my room had dust everywhere and the walls on the bathroom had boogers from previous guests... gross to say the least. Room in general are dated and the hotel lobby and restaurant area lacked the luxury feel I would expect from an intercontinental hotel. Just seemed like a rundown version of an otherwise well known hotel chain.  Also the signage of the hotel on the building lit up as \"er inental\" Because half the lights were out in the sign, I guess this was a sign from above on what's going on inside.  If you are staying in downtown Montreal, stay at the W."}
{"text":"Beautiful room, staff is polite and professional as most people are in Montreal. Great location for walking to fabulous, upscale restaurants and the boardwalk. Nice breakfast cafe just downstairs."}
{"text":"The hotel itself is located in the old city, and steps away from all the historic sites -- which I consider a positive. Despite the room decor being a bit dated, this review is dedicated to the manager, Laurence. We were in Montreal for a special occasion and she was kind enough to upgrade us to one of the top floor / penthouse master suites. Thank you for your hospitality, and we look forward to visiting next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I have stayed at this hotel about a dozen times over the past couple of years (2008-2011) and I definitely am a fan. More so a fan probably, since I usually stay for business and the company forks out the $ for me to stay here.   Rooms are fairly large and immaculate! Bathrooms include a stand alone shower and tub off to the side, telephone on the wall next to the potty for those long conversations one has while going to the loo (kidding), and a great speaker system  built into the wall so you can continue to listen to the television show you may have been watching while you shower or go to the bathroom. Fully stocked with towels, toilet paper, and other bathroom essentials.   Hotel is close to old Montreal, but other than that, if you're younger and looking to bar hop, I would suggest staying elsewhere, I 'think' this hotel is closer to the business district so think 'concrete' jungle for the most part. Nice restaurant within the hotel.   Would i stay here again? For sure. As long as I was on business and just looking for a comfortable place to stay."}
{"text":"Location is ok for exploring Old Montreal and the business district. A little less optimal for Plateau and Parc areas. The rooms are a little tired, not that I really mind usually but for 4 stars +? The lobby however, is very.... Florida contemporary?  To be honest, I was most disappointed with all of the additional fees. I booked on Priceline and I understand that the confusion might lie there, but still. Requested two beds and was told at check in that two beds would be an additional fee. Self park, additional fee. We brought our pet, additional fee. Wifi? fee! Bottled water - fee! I understand that often there are fees but there was no mention of it, or even the potential fees via Priceline OR the Intercontinental's own site. Once all was said and done we paid almost double per night than I had expected. The staff reduced the fees a little but I was annoyed. After a very long drive and a late evening check in, I was not in the mood. And no, you are not ALWAYS charged for your pet. We have stayed at plenty of hotels where there was no additional fee (I love you Ritz Carlton.)   Really enjoyed the cleaning lady on the 11th floor though, she was lovely.   In the end it was fine, but too expensive once you added everything up. We stayed at the Omni the year before for $60 less or so per night, and we had a wonderful room."}
{"text":"Superbe hôtel à Montreal extrêmement bien situé, à quelques minutes de marche du Vieux-Montreal et du Vieux-Port.  Les chambres sont spacieuses et très confortables ! Le petit déjeuner était délicieux avec un grand choix de produits sucrés et salés, de quoi bien commencer sa journée !"}
{"text":"It was a nice hotel. Great location. It has access to RESO, the underground tunnels that gets you around without having to be outside in the cold.  The room was great. Wallpaper in bathroom was peeling off, so it was kind of gross. There was a phone next to the toilet, that was kind of weird.   The staff was really nice, friendly, and helpful. The environment was really nice except for when I stumbled onto two drunk girls with little clothing on, one without shoes, and one with only socks.  I didn't go into the restaurant because of the cost, but it smelled really really really good.  Getting to your car is kind of a pain since their parking was in the sub level 9 and 10."}
{"text":"Five nights in a suite!!! I think we deserved something for our money. Housekeeping was terrible. Bathroom dirt was the same from day one to day five. We even left a tip to see if room tidier. Nope. No two days were the same. Not sure rooms were vacumned. Anna at check in was wonderful and welcoming. We felt special. Marianna at check out was blase and cold. She didn't care we just spent five night and a lot of money at her hotel. When we questioned a charge she acted like we were cheating. Larry in the Club Room was delightful and extremely helpful. If you go ask him anything. He is a font of information. Hotel is in a great location and Montreal is a great walking city. Just wish the rest of the staff showed as mush caring as Anna and Larry for being such a luxury hotel."}
{"text":"This is a nice moderately upscale hotel with a great list of amenities situated in a great location near St. Laurent St.    The concierge and staff are have always been great to me when I have stayed here.  They are also very accommodating and friendly.     The rooms are pleasing and comfortable. Laying on the bed too long will make you want to take a nap.   My only complaint is lack of free WiFi and overpriced minibar."}
{"text":"Back to La Belle Ville!  Having grown up in Montreal but not lived there for 20yrs, I always look forward to heading back...especially when work is paying! Hazaaah! And while I was looking forward to my stay at the IM, I was rather disappointed with several elements. Let's just say that my mom runs a way tighter ship.   List of grievances:  - Hidden charges: these were everywhere! Tax and surcharge for room service, no prices anywhere for mini bar (yes, i assumed it was pricey but full disclosure is preferred). Also, who doesn't have free wi-fi these days!?!? Their charge of $10 for 2h is unheard of. Luckily we got a code as part of our meeting but not after a few people had already ponied up the cash.    - Low quality products: first off, the remote in my room was infuriating! very hard to switch channels, increase volume and sometimes the remote ghost woudl take over and change channels when all I wanted was to mute it for a second. Very bizarre. Also, the towels in the bathrooms were like sandpaper. And i'm not being precious here...they were really rough. Also, it looked like the bathroom hadn't had a good upkeep in years. Paint chips and caulking coming off the bathtub. Verging on ghetto.  - Slightly crusty staff: i had to print out 1 page, sign and fax back to Vancouver during the meeting. I couldn't really believe how crusty the woman was at the desk about it. They like to hold meetings there so isn't this a common request? She could have just told me that the meeting would be charged to use the business center and sent me on my way. Wasn't too sure why it was an issue.  - General cheeziness: i'm not sure if this is a bad thing. One thing about us Quebecois is we like our cheese and not only in curd format. This hotel was clearly designed in the 1990s with it's lobby decked out in faux fur walls, sequins and feathered pillows. Or maybe it was designed last week. That's just a Quebec thing. But it is VERY cheesy. Including the ads for the absinthe bar with the promise of seductive red lips and the green genie. It put me off a bit but then I remembered my roots and just got into it. If you like nouveau chique and modern design this isn't your place though. You've been warned.   All in all, I think the Coast in Nanaimo is better which is kinda sad when you consider the international level of travelers going through Montreal. I would expect service level to be much higher. But it is walking distance to Old Montreal, Chinatown, downtown and St-Laurent so for the price, probably worth a look."}
{"text":"We stayed here for 2 nights on a trip to Montreal for the U2 concert. We had no intention of spending time in the hotel, but having one that was so accessible and walking distance to Old Montreal made this place absolutely perfect.   Its pretty dead on the weekends since you are placed in the business center of Montreal, but you are only a short walk away from Vieux-Port (Old Montreal) and there are numerous bars, restaurants and art galleries where you can lose yourself for hours.   The hotel itself was fastidiously clean. They let us check in a few hours early (huge plus) and we were given a room with an impeccable view of the harbor.   Perhaps because my friend had a business connection with Intercontinental, we even got a small box of cupcakes and a complimentary bottle of sparkling water on our first night there.   The absinthe bar downstairs is only patronized by people staying at the hotel, so make sure you like the subject of whatever conference is going on. We were there during a shipbuilding conference of some sort. I did not try any absinthe but we did grab some post-concert food here... it was incredibly overpriced $12 for nachos and $11 for chicken tenders as I recall. Convenience won us over, alas, and we ended up ringing up a huge bar tab late night both nights of our stay. (By huge, I mean $170 on Sunday... I wasnt a huge part of that but my husband and his buddy sure were!)   I checked out the gym but my legs were sore from dancing the night before so I didnt work out. However, the equipment looked new, but be forewarned that there is not much there. The pool was nice but indoors, however, I discovered a small sitting area outside of it with a table, chairs and a few lounge chairs. Good to know that was there, would have been a nice spot for an outdoor picnic lunch.   All in all, solid hotel in the business district with good service."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst hotel on the island, like I would rather sleep next to homeless person on a cardboard box before stepping back into that box ..."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a few nights recently on a business trip, and let me tell you a little about me when I travel. First, I hate planes, and I will stop a plane from taking off if I don't have a half of a beloved Xanax. I love, love, love to travel, but it makes me so gosh-darn anxious at the same time. So, I really love it when a hotel makes me feel comfortable and at home, and that's exactly what this lovely hotel did.   My room was very spacious and extra clean. My bed was heavenly, my view was beautiful, the shower was perfect, and there was a separate tub in my room with lovely boxes of soap. I ordered room service one evening, and that was wonderful, too. The chicken was perfect and the veggies were crisp and tasted like they were fresh from the garden. I also met up with some colleagues at the hotel's restaurant just outside the lobby -- sorry, I'm forgetting the name of the place -- but the roast and cucumber soup I had were simply delish. Oh, and I don't know what they put in their vodka tonics, but the tonic has this extra sweet flavor that was just a little different and special. I don't speak much French, but I had a very easy time speaking to the bilingual staff in English. The concierge was very helpful and friendly, and even let me email her some of my business documents and printed them for me at no charge. What a gal. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!   And one more thing, this hotel is in a perfect location and walking distance to the city's main attractions!"}
{"text":"Very swanky hotel in the middle of downtown. Everyone was very nice, particularly Kevin at the front desk. One downside is that they weren't able to expedite the checkin, as we got into the hotel really early due to an overnight flight, so we got into the room around 2pm after waiting in the lobby from about 11:30 (though, they didn't bother us ). Would stay here again if I'm back in this wonderful cold city."}
{"text":"We stayed here for 4 days while we were in town. It is good walking distance to Old Montreal, Downtown and many attractions. 20 minute drive to the oratory, would be over an hour walk on a nice day but was cold and rainy during our stay. The hotel was well appointed and our room was very well kept with a large bathroom. The concierges Gary and Jemil were extremely knowledgeable and had great recommendations for the city. Gary made sure our itineraries were confirmed and that we were on time for everything and Jemil made sure we were well fed and made us reservations at great places. He also helped me find a 24 hours pharmacy when I had a late night emergency and everything I could find was closed. The desk staff was super helpful, the cleaning staff were prompt. The only time they were delayed, we had the do not disturb sign on the room until shortly after 10 am and we were back to the room at 4 to rest and they were cleaning so we went to the rooftop patio to relax until they were done. They are not mind readers and I did not expect them to clean the room the moment we left especially when they had completed servicing the other rooms on our floor, so I think that was reasonable. Our only complaint was that the pool was quite small and has short hours. We have never been to hotel with a pool that closes at 7pm before and it did not give us any time to enjoy it at all since we had busy days and were frequently not back to the hotel until at least 9-10. Additional costs to factor in are parking and WiFi as neither are free to hotel guests."}
{"text":"Introduction  This hotel is centrally located, but I got a ride from the airport (which by the way, is not far). There is valet parking and when I arrived, you have to go up an escalator to check-in. It appears this hotel is attached to a mall (?) or inside complex which is very convenient. My boyfriend had checked in the night before so all I had to do was go up. Elevators are near the hotel's main restaurant.  Room 1906  Our room was a nice corner \"suite.\" It was sizeable and the bathroom was really huge. We didn't stay in the room that much but it was comfortable. Signature flat-screen tv, sitting area, safety deposit box, two closets (nice for extra space) and mini-bar. I wasn't too keen on the bathroom products (it said something about San Francisco) and while I usually love the smell of Lemon Verbena, these products weren't up to snuff. They didn't pass the \"Charlotte takes all the products home\" test.  Amenities  This hotel has a pool, gym, and spa. The hotel site makes the pool look nice and long, which is perfect for lap swimming. But because there is so much to do and see in Montreal, my boyfriend and I hardly got to use any of the facilities  One main restaurant and one lounge/bar. My friends and I (we stayed at the same hotel) decided to check out this bar and it wasn't too bad. Another review on that.  Valet Parking available. Every time we wanted to go out, we had to call the Concierge to get our car ready. I had slight issues with this as every time I called, there was no one at the Concierge desk. I had to try multiple times, only to call the Front Desk to get my car.   Conclusion  I came here with my boyfriend and because he is an IHG member, he stayed here for the points. Overall, I didn't have the best impression of this hotel. Nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary; it's just a place to stay. There was one day when we left at 10AM, returned back at midnight, only to find that our room had not been cleaned at all. The day before, it was cleaned at around 6pm when we were getting ready to go out. This inconsistency for me is a big no-no. Two star deductions (and no, we didn't leave the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on). Staff aren't really friendly either, but perhaps I wasn't being friendly to them?  Location can't be beat. When one is in Montreal, you don't expect to lounge in the hotel anyways, so really, the InterContinental is just a place to crash. But on that note, I am sure there are cheaper options if you want a just-to-crash hotel. For the price you are paying, there are some expectations."}
{"text":"I stayed here in late April 2013 for a conference at the Palais de congress which was perfect since it was right across the street. Check- in was straight forward and the staff was friendly to a non-French speaking guest. I came a few days early to take in the city and it was a good location. It was between two Metro stops and close to the Old Port. The concierge was fantastic and had good tips for places to dine as well as shop. They also made reservations for you for places that were more difficult to get in to. I would stay here again."}
{"text":"We booked on Hotwire, so we weren't exactly sure what we were going to get for a hotel.  Its ratings were pretty high, though, so we were semi-confident in our decision.  We really lucked out!    Upon entering one of the doors to the hotel (and especially parking underground), It was a little confusing to try to weave your way to the front desk, but there were many magnificent views along the way.  The lobby (and hallways) are beautifully decorated with a retro modern look.  The elevators to the rooms are quick, plentiful, and very clean.  Upon entry into our room, my jaw dropped.  For a hotel room, it was HUGE.  The decor was updated and very welcoming.  The king-size bed was still dwarfed by the room, and it was oh-so-comfortable after a day of exploring Montreal on foot.  There was also a reading chair and ottoman, mini-bar, and large flat-screen TV in the room, and there was still a lot of leftover space!  The closet was also huge.  The bathroom was very clean, marbled, and luxurious as well.  The towels weren't super soft, but that can be overlooked with everything else that the room had going for it.  There's also a phone in the bathroom should you need one (but, really, why would you?).  We felt very pampered and slept SO well in this comfortable, clean, quiet room.  I wished we had a longer stay. :(    Off the lobby, there's a coffee shop called Java U that serves a plethora of breakfast/lunch choices at very reasonable prices.  We didn't get a chance to try out the bar or other dining options, but they looked very nice.    Underground parking is convenient, but a bit pricey here.  It's $20+ per time you exit and/or day, so make sure you only go out once a day if you're going to drive anywhere!  We walked to most places downtown, took the hop-on, hop-off bus tour, and/or jumped on the Metro subway.  (There's a entry to the Underground just across the street from the hotel.  There may even be a connection from the hotel.  It's big enough and we never did explore everything.)    The hotel was in a good location, too.  It wasn't right amongst the downtown attractions, but it's only a short walk away, and we loved the exercise.    We'd definitely consider staying here again on a future visit to Montreal; it'll probably be the first place we check out when booking again."}
{"text":"I've got major beef with ANY establishment that charges $16/day for WiFi. It's 2013, people! C'mon! You can do better than that. I've stayed in cheap motels that offer free wifi. Especially for an international traveler, wifi is super important, and paying $16 per day for something that *should* be FREE really grinds my gears. Now that my rant is out of the way, the hotel was decent. Nothing special. The concierge desk NEVER picked up the phone when I called from the room which was semi-annoying. But overall, not a bad place to stay in Montreal."}
{"text":"The hotel and a business efficiency seemed decent enough. However, upon entering the room, it was filled with the stench of mold, floors were wet, and decor looked like it hadn't been touched up in 10 years. Not even was the envelope inside the welcome book clean. Everything looked as though it's been stepped on and clearly marked from other usage.  Service was barely helpful so we checked out, canceling the remainder of the stay and booked another hotel room.  The rest of our weekend will be spent coughing up phlegm and downing antihistamines to avoid getting properly sick from our allergies to the mold."}
{"text":"This hotel has a very welcoming lobby with a huge curved couch and (faux?) fur lined walls.  The staff were all very accomodating and the room was incredibly comfortable.  I appreciated the free wi-fi and the plug-ins on the bedside table lamps.  I would have enjoyed a deeper bathtub but liked that I could turn up the separate heat in the bathroom.  The breakfast room was very small and that caused a line-up in the morning.  We weren't given menus so assumed the buffet was the only option.  It wasn't great and was $25!  Yikes.  It was pretty close to 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Woohoo... I'm the first to review!   I was a bit hesitant about staying here since the reviews on other sites were mixed, however I found this hotel to be great and suitable to our needs. For anyone that is concerned about the construction, there should be no worries. The construction is really just a renovation that is confined to just the lounge/bar area. No noise or dust anywhere. The staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. The manager hooked us up with a room upgrade to a suite room! We also received a lot of great recommendations on where to sight-see (Parc du Mont-Royal) and where to drink/eat (Weinstein and Gustovino's).   Our suite room (Room 1000) is modern and nicely laid out. There were several issues that we did notice, however did not really bother us all that much: No hairdryer (front desk asked us to look in the cabinet under the sink, but it was a pedestal sink!), the bed was VERY firm and the linens a bit rough for my silky smooth skin. Oh, and just a side note, there were spiders on the exterior of the building; no possible way of getting in, but did anyone else notice that all of Montreal is just crawling with spiders all over the place???   Parking was a bit odd. Hotel guests have to park in P-9/P-10 which is 9/10 flights below (we got a bit dizzy going in circles). The elevator is right there, although it only goes as far up to the Food Court level. You then have to walk up a flight of stairs to the lobby to check-in. Because of this set up, there is no one to help you with your luggage if you do self parking. Odd.   Overall, I really enjoyed staying here and would gladly stay here again. The neighborhood is a bit dead during the weekends, however the Metro is right in the candy-land convention center across the street and everything is within a 10 minute walk."}
{"text":"We've stayed in two other Montreal hotels in the past 2 years, so we had some basis for comparison when staying here.  I chose the Intercontinental for its proximity to the old town and the fact that it had a special rate through the Montreal tourism site.  Upon arrival on a Saturday evening, we were able to park on the street for free (it was after 6) which allowed us easy access to the hotel.  We were told we had been \"upgraded\" to a room with a view.  And what a view!  We were on the 24th floor for two nights.  The room was spacious and clean.  The king size bed was super comfy- the pillows were ridiculously soft, which may not be for everyone.  The bathroom was big, too, as it had a small shower with good water pressure AND a tub.  And I will mention- as it matters to me- that the hairdryer provided was awesome.    Generally, this hotel is great, though wi-fi and breakfast cost extra unlike many hotel deals in Montreal.  We didn't take advantage of the pool or the business center which I suppose are two of the other perks of the hotel.  Generally, stay here if you can find a good deal.  Otherwise, you may be like us and need less and therefore can stay somewhere with free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this hotel - not on par with other Intercontinentals. Lap pool deck was dirty, for a family of four the maid kept leaving only one bath towel, did not replenish coffee or bath products in room. The rug and drawers were dirty. One concierge was great, the other was slow and did not provide good recommendations. Location is great but for the price we were truly disappointed."}
{"text":"This hotel was fantastic!! Excellent value for the price. I could not believe how attentive and helpful the front reception staff were. They went out of their way to prepare our room for us early and made sure that I had a hypoallergenic bed as requested and even double checked to make sure it was all executed correctly. The concierge was also helpful and able to direct us to various locations as needed.  I would recommend taking a walk around the adjoining Victoria square on the lower level. It's full of shops, restaurants and a must see fountain area. The Sarah B absinth bar was also a pleasure. We enjoyed some lovely cocktails and wine on several occasions. If you are looking for some fine dining, the Toqué restaurant across the street was named best restaurant in Canada. It's not cheap but should definitely be on your bucket list. I  would definitely stay at this hotel again.  The only improvement that I might suggest for this hotel would be to eliminate the perfume scent in the main lobby. It is extremely strong and assaulting to the senses for one with allergies! It made me feel quite sick actually. For this I deduct 1 star."}
{"text":"I recently attended a conference in Montreal and stayed at this hotel.  Their meeting spaces are very nice and were an excellent choice for the meetings, cocktail receptions and group dinner that were part of the conference.  In addition the onsite restaurant -- Osco, was very good, even though they did not have any vegetarian options on the menu.  The waiter graciously agreed to have the chef prepare a marinara pasta with fresh vegetables, that was absolutely perfect.   My room was spacious.  I chose a \"deluxe irresistible room\" and was quite satisfied with the space provided.  However, the air conditioning unit in the room was not very good and I had to constantly adjust it as the room became very stuffy every couple of hours.  Also, while there is a time and place for a dimly lit room, the inability to brighten the room up for reading or working at the desk provided, was frustrating.  The hotel was conviently located within walking distance of many tourist attractions, restaurants and shopping.  The lobby area was colorful, but the furniture was worn and torn in some spots.  In addition, the charge for WiFi was surprising and seemingly not fully understood by the hotel staff.  I purchased 24 hours access for $15, but still found that there were separate charges for each time I accessed the internet during that 24 hour period.  Fortunately, I did not utilize the express check-out option and instead went to the front desk before I left and asked to inspect my bill.  The gym was pretty small, but sufficient given the apparent lack of interest of the other guests.  The small oscillating fan did not fully cool down the room, but because it was not crowded, it was not uncomfortably warm in the gym.  I would not rule out returning to this hotel, but would investigate other options first."}
{"text":"My husband booked this hotel for our one night stay passing through Montreal. We got in around 4pm, checked right in. The concierge seemed annoyed that I didn't know where the main lobby was (but to be honest, didn't see a sign anywhere, so, make some bigger signs maybe?). The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and nice. Two people on the desk and no line.   The girl enrolled me in the members program and gave me a 2pm checkout for the next day, which was helpful, because we only had 1 day to spend in Montreal and didn't want to schlep our stuff down to the car.   As far as rooms go, it was ginormous. We usually get tiny closets when we book hotels on Travelocity, like we're being punished for using a discount program. But this was great. Bathroom was huge. Shower was lovely. It would have been nice if the tub was deeper/larger like the one we had in our little hotel in Quebec City.   We enjoyed the stay very much.  My husband self-parked, and he said he had to park in the third circle of hell, all the way down the bottom, like P-12 or something. And when he came up, he wasn't sure where the hotel was. Again, signage not really obvious, so he exited the building and came around the front.   I have to say that the bellhop (is that a term people use anymore) named Mark was the best part of our stay. He was outstanding, kind, chatty but not fake about it (I worked in tourism for years so I know when people are just yakking at me). Mark had great recommendations for dinner in Chinatown, and was just the most genuinely nice, pleasant person ever. I hope that the hotel reads this review and commends Mark on his skills. We are big fans.   Excellent walk to Old Town and the Cathedral. We had gorgeous weather, and covered a lot of territory there.   Didn't get to try the Absinthe bar, but took some pretty pictures there.   All told - we'll probably go back and stay here, and I hope we get the same kind of room. This was great."}
{"text":"My friend and I stayed here for Labor Day weekend.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful.  The decor is very contemporary and the architecture near the lobby is very interesting.  The rooms are clean and have adequate spacing.  However, WiFi nor continental breakfast is included (like it is at the Embassy Suites next door).  The hotel offers free WiFi for an hour during your stay AND the hotspot is located in the lobby!  I have to say, that made my stay inconvenient.  I have stayed in several hotels all over the United States both high end and not so high end, and they all came with free WiFi.    Bottom line: Stay somewhere else, where all amenities are included with no additional fees!"}
{"text":"This in by far some of the best service I've ever had! In the Club room off the lobby you're greeted by Larry with a beautiful smile & a story.  Larry has a love of life, Work , family and food that's infectious! He should be on list of top 10 in Montreal! The concierge was spot on with local clubs & eateries. Clearly knows Montreal. Desk staff was helpful.  Room was large , clean and nice touches with arrival and departure .  There is lots to choose from & would not stay anywhere else."}
{"text":"Spent 2 nights at InterContinental to kick off a nice weekend in Montreal.  The location is great, right across Palais des Congres, and 2 Metro stops, and the Old Port and Chinatown is right there too.  In the Hotel there's Java-U cafe downstairs, Sarah B's Absinthe lounge, and Osco a high end Restaurant ; both on the Second floor up the escalator glidding up the Birch and Fur lined walls .    The Bag check guys are on the bottom floor and the lobby to check in is on the 2nd floor. This check in was the worst I've ever seen! There are 1or 2 people checking you in, and the line is crazy long. The 3 days I stayed there , I don't think I Didn't see people waiting in line for something, that crazy!!   I thought the decor was modern-fun, there were fresh Lilly flowers, and big couch to chill on. It did remind me of a Vegas Hotel.  And off the lobby is meeting rooms and conference Center with lots of boutiques and shops, pharmacy, infinity pond, giant chandelier ALL Inside.  I even saw a wedding held there one night.   My fiancé surprised me with a sweet. The bathroom was nice, marble in the showers around the bathtub. There's a portable map hanging on the bathroom door of how to walk/jog to the Old Port and back, with your choice of different routes based on distance. I thought that was thoughtful and I took advantage of it.   The TV was a nice Samsung flatscreen, and the stereo system plays throughout, even in the bathroom there are speakers. Rees a Kureg one-cup coffee maker which made awesome Van Houtte coffee, and green tea.  There was a desk, two chairs, and a little table it was a cute room set-up.  The bed was super comfy and the comforter  ( they keep you hot in winter and cool in the summer) was Plush.  One morning we asked to have the room cleaned before we returned from breakfast and a walk, and the room was not made. We had to ask addition times, and no apology.  The gym was good, they had all the equipment needed for a good workout. They do charge for water (3-6$), or offer the Water-fountain, the girl working the desk was rude and couldn't care less to say 'hi, welcome, bye, or have a nice day' . The second day there was a nicer guy and he offered workout towels and greeted us and asked if we needed anything.  We checked out the pool , it smelled soo strongly of chlorine I thought it would bleach my hair by just walking through the room. Outside of the pool wanted to hit the Sun Deck to get some sun one day, and there was a group of 5 partiers, there goes that idea! It was Tiny! Like a balcony really with a couple of trees.  It was disappointing to have a great Hotel not meet the expectations or standards of customer service of other high end Hotels.   There are waaaay better Hotels around Montreal for a better price, or higher end Hotels that treat you amazing and it's worth it. I left this place feeling cheated, and disappointed."}
{"text":"Stayed there last night. Nice hotel downtown with nice rooms and good service. Not sure why people were complaining about no free internet. It's free if you're a guest. Nothing to complain about really."}
{"text":"Nice hotel located in a great area. We used jetsetters mystery hotel and got this one!  Plenty of features. Concierge was helpful. Restaurants within hotel. Metro without leaving building.   Room was spacious. We had a king intimate (only slept two people) and it was very nice. No view however from the window despite being on the 17th floor it overlooked another room just across the way.   Shower had two nozzles for extra warmth. Bathroom scale (to keep track of those extra vacation pounds) and a nice sitting chair.   Parking was expensive and a hassle to get to car. Park on st Jacques street and parking is 17$ instead of 23 daily if you are staying for a while."}
{"text":"I spent a couple nights at this hotel recently and I wasn't disappointed. This is a high-end hotel and was very comfortable.  The room was sizable as was the bathroom.   A nice breakfast buffet was included in the room and had a lot of good options.  It's also on the border between the city and the old town so it's very convenient. I went for a long run one morning which was great.  I hope to return some day."}
{"text":"Stayed here for almost a week while in Montreal.  Check in was a bit annoying because we showed up around 2:30 and our room wasn't ready yet. We waited almost an hour before we got fed up and had to start nagging the front desk to do something because honestly we were really tired and had been hanging out in the lobby on the couches. Thankfully we were able to get into a room, and our bags were brought up for us.  The room itself was very nice and had a cool view. The bathroom was large and clean, and the shower was separate from the tub which was interesting. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets had a really high thread count because they were SO SOFT. However, maid service was a bit lacking at this hotel because only ONCE was our room made up before we got back in the afternoon.   Our key reader on the door died but the maintenance man was quick about coming up and replacing it. The concierge was super nice and recommended some good places to eat, but doing a quick yelp search was a good backup. Location for the hotel is quite good; you can definitely walk to Chinatown or Old Town. Taxis are lined up just outside the hotel."}
{"text":"We came for 5 nights for leisure.  We stayed in room 2400, the Iconic Tourelle suite.  We are Platinum Ambassador members.  The room was excellent.  The pillows and mattress were surprisingly comfortable.  The outlets were ample.  The bathroom was great.  The view of the city was excellent!  The location is excellent.  The hotel is very close to the business district and Old Montreal area.  The hotel is connected to the Trade Center complex, and that includes indoor access to the Underground City and Metro.  Victoria Square is very close.  When we checked in, we were told that the upgrade room would not be available for 2 hours.  We were instead offered free Club Lounge privileges.  I also saw signs that Club privileges were available for $60/night, or $40/night for Ambassador members.  This was a shock for me - I'm used to the Club Lounge being automatically available for free as a part of my Ambassador membership.  This seems to be a nickel and dime way to make money.  I have to note Larry the Lounge concierge as one of the bright lights of the hotel.  He's a true asset!"}
{"text":"Pursuant to the recommendation of Doctor Elsie W., the entries on her blog, along with Doctor Elsie W.'s spreadsheet of tips, I chose this hotel. I'm glad I did. (Oh, you haven't read LifeOnMacro yet? Here - http://lifeonmacro.com/travels/).    Stayed for two evenings in January of 2015 and was quite satisfied. The regular room was very large, and my King bed was a bit on the soft side, though quite comfortable. Television programming in English is available, but some of these French programs appear fun, too!  I wish the hotel would provide more than merely two small bottles of water and two Keurig cups of coffee. I don't need the other Keurig Cups! Just give me all coffee and allow me to give in to my addiction! I also wish that our room wasn't so close to a stairway because, believe it or not, we can hear people walking the stairs (who walks the stairs up 15 floors? Health nuts like Doctor Elsie W., probably).  The location is superb if you're interested in walking the area. It's a block or so away from Notre Dame Basilica, not far from The Keg Steakhouse (amazing review about it to be written later), near plenty of bakeries, and connects directly to the Underground City in the basement. Wintertime can get quite chilly out there, so I recommend driving and using a standalone GPS, even though things may seem very close by. Parking in Montreal is generally plentiful, with a few exceptions, of course.  The hotel parking lot is convenient, too - you can park it yourself overnight by entering the lot on the side of the hotel, taking a ticket, and paying when you leave. Note that you will need to go to L9 or lower to self-park (we chose L10 because it was closer to the elevators for us). Going back up to the hotel room requires the use of three different elevators, but it's easy to figure out once you get the hang of it. Don't expect to see too many staff around to help you around the parking lot, though.  I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Stayed here on our wedding night. We booked through Hotwire but they upgraded us to a suite for free. Very very cool on their part. Hotel is located in a great location. Rooms were very very nice. Service was extremely friendly too. Only complaint that I had was that the valet was a little slow. All in all, would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"I really loved this hotel. When I graduated high school I got an all expenses paid trip to Montreal and this hotel was part of the package.   This hotel was much fancier that what I am used to, so clearly I was impressed with just about everything. One problem I generally have with hotels [nice or not] is feeling comfortable in the beds and with the pillows. However, the mattress was perfect, not to hard, not too soft. And the pillows were great as well, they had tons of them, some super soft, some a little firm, and a couple hard ones. I found what suited me best and had absolutely no problems sleeping.   The bathroom was lovely as well, we had a jacuzzi tub and a rather typical shower but we thoroughly enjoyed both!   The concierge service was fantastic. I had been to Montreal a couple times before but since this time I was with a friend we were looking for anything crazy we could get into. The person we spoke with was completely committed to making sure we knew exactly where we were going, how we were going to get there, and what to expect. This hotel is in a great location and my friend and I felt comfortable walking to all the hot spots we wanted to hit.   Check out was a breeze, parking was not. Like Michael said, the parking garage was a bit of a maze, but other than that I really enjoyed this hotel!"}
{"text":"I found this hotel to be a bit dated compared to other IC properties but its location can't be beat. Situated in Old Montreal, its within walking distance to  everything you'd want to do and see (ie. Notre Dame Basilica, Old Port, Downtown, McGill, nightlife). I could not be happier. Our flight arrived a bit later than we expected and my room was still guaranteed. Ambassador membership guarantees a free upgrade also, so we ended up with a King Corner Room. Bed was extremely comfy. I slept like a baby.   We were greeted with a welcome fruit dish and water, and OMG cupcakes (!!!) from their local Les Glaceurs (cupcakes and cones) in Old Montreal. LOVED IT!  2 smaller bottles of water was replenished in our fridge everyday as well, keeping us hydrated throughout the day.   The shower was a bit small for my liking though- I'm not the largest person but think the shower itself could use a bit more square footage, even though the bathroom was pretty spacious in and of itself.   Housekeeping was good- we always had fresh towels and a clean room. They did try to come multiple times the first morning, but luckily I had the lock up; my fault though for forgetting to place the \"do not disturb\" sign out front.   TV is a bit small- then again, we were too tired to watch any tv at the end of the day. FYI- Ambassador status gives you a free in room movie if you're up for it. Free Wifi too.  I didn't check out the other amenities because we were there for only a weekend, but I would happily return again.   Also- we were given a voucher for complimentary drinks for 2 at their bar (Sarah b.) as a 'thank you' for being an Ambassador member. This hotel recognizes status and will go above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.   Taxi stand right outside the hotel at all hours of the day- we left around 4:30a to catch our super early morning flight and had no issue finding a taxi.   Front desk was always happy to help resolve any issue, and it can be a busy hotel- in one weekend we witnessed a wedding and a conference going on. And yet, we were still well taken care of. Think that says a lot :)"}
{"text":"Pro's: close to tourist destination, close to Metro which public train transportation, comfortable rooms, courteous employee... Big thumbs up for the bellboys and valet parking personnel, their housekeeping always gives us clean towels and toiletries.  Con's: waited so long for our room when we checked in, after traveling for  6 hours from NY we were hoping it will be ready by then, we tried to check in earlier which we understand our fault, left and walked around and grabbed lunch by 3pm we were back and tired and the room is not still ready, we ended up having a nap in their lobby lol... But in return they gave us complimentary breakfast which is a big plus for us who's trying to save bucks!  Another thing is the pool's too small,  Overall we were satisfied with our stay!"}
{"text":"The Intercontinental Montreal is a beautiful hotel conveniently located between old port and downtown, about a 15 minute walk from each. The foyer and lobby are beautiful and not too over the top, but very glamorous. The staff was super friendly from the valets to the front desk and even the cleaning crew. Over Valentine's weekend, they even gave us a rose at check in. The rooms are nice with a huge bed and overall very comfy, though not huge. We had a decent view of the downtown skyline around the corner of our room which was nice. The wifi was good, and didn't drop out, but was a bit slow compared to other hotels. The parking garage is a little pricey, but convenient when staying for a short time. There are several restaurants attached and even a bit of a mall on the side where you don't even have to go outside on a cold day."}
{"text":"Great hotel with spacious, tastefully decorated rooms. It is located just a few seconds away from two subway stops, Place D'armes or Place Victioria and is located in the financial district of the city near the Old City.  The lobby is connected to two restaurants, Osco and Sarah B's Absinthe Lounge and there is also a coffee shop downstairs called Java U.   The hotel is very quiet, quite fancy and the concierge was wonderful and extremely knowledgeable. If the weather isn't great you can take the back exit and access a tunnel that will connect you to the subway without having to set foot outside which is also pretty neat. The back exit also features an arcade where there is a convenience store, a couple of small restaurants and a few random shops. I had a wonderful stay there in this hotel."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at IC with my spouse.  We stayed a few days following a conference.    I would like to highlight the outstanding work of your concierge - Chantal Aubry.   Ms. Aubry helped us out when we were looking for places to eat and recommended a few excellent choices.  Her service was prompt and upbeat.  She was a pleasure to deal with.  And her choices were exactly what we were looking for.   When we had a special request which should could not answer on the spot - she indicated she would call our room with the information later that day.  She fulfilled her promise, and called us later with yet another superior recommendation.    Ms. Aubry embodies fine customer service and is one of the reasons for a great experience.  It was a pleasure to stay at IC, and we look forward to returning sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Arrived on July 1st, so expected it to be busy, which it was. Location is very central to restaurants and old town Montreal. Rooms are decent, more spacious than most hotels in the area. The biggest issue would be the poor service.  My husband and I had booked 2 rooms for ourselves and our children, but for some reason they were not close to each other. When I went to the reception area to ask about adjoining rooms, I waited 25 minutes while 2 employees looked over their computer. My query was less than a minute to answer (which was basically, is the adjoining room available?) yet I wasted almost half an hour waiting to even ask the question. Excellent Service is not a priority at this hotel. Even mediocre service is not attainable. I would definitely advise to look elsewhere in Montreal if you need high quality service along with your room."}
{"text":"After my friend had said she had her wedding at this hotel I felt comfortable in booking a room for a long weekend. I couldn't have been happier with our accommodations. The room was so big I probably could have put another bed into it. The staff was helpful when we needed to exchange money and where we could go for a quick breakfast. With such great prices I wouldn't hesitate staying here again. The location was also very close to Notre Dame Cathedral which is one of the things you must see when you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"We were there for only one night - as a resident of Montreal I don't really stay in hotels here.  The lobby is nice and the service is helpful and friendly.  The room was nice enough and the bed very comfy.  We had the buffet brunch the next day which I thought was so so.  Pretty much standard fare and was included in the deal we got for the room. If I had to pay $25 for that I would have been pissed.  My only real complaint, and this is for the hotel industry in general - why are they charging $7 for a bottle of water?  You'd think they'd give it as a courtesy."}
{"text":"No complaints whatsoever.   CLEAN! Which is most important. The rooms are spacious and include anything you'd need to spend the night(s).   Gorgeous interior design both throughout the lobby & in the rooms.   Helpful staff, a great bar & cafe in the hotel as well.   Check in & check out we're a breeze, too - always a plus.   Oh and superb wifi! Important for those of you who may stay for business, or are traveling internationally and do not have normal cellular service."}
{"text":"Stayed here for 3 nights during the Canada Day celebrations, and despite the city being jam-packed and the hotel packed with tourists, the hotel was very clean, spacious and the staff were super helpful.  Being in close proximity to the old city, it makes travel around the city's attractions easier.  All of their staff were bi-lingual, and we had no issues."}
{"text":"Excellent Room elegant hotel with beautiful palais de congress view at 10th floor efficient and kind staff. The gym area is rather little but it is quit good"}
{"text":"The hotel is a good option through-and-through. It's a bit of an older property, but the rooms are spacious and the location close to old montreal. They also allow dogs for a $45 fee. In terms of value, I think you could find better if paying full pop, but again, it is a good option."}
{"text":"Great service, if you can get it!  In true Canadian fashion, people will take their time, but as long as you are patient and you do have their attention, the service is great! (whenever that may be)  Nice hotel connected to a small mall.  Parking next door that you have to pay for.  Clean rooms that could use a little refreshing, but overall fantastic experience.  Bar has decent bar food and drink selection, not many beers on tap, but those cocktails sure are smoooooth.  Super conveniently located, walkable everywhere of interest."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for our ten-year anniversary and had a fantastic time.  He told them ahead of time that it was a special occasion for us, and they really went out of their way to make it special for us!  They left cupcakes in our room and gave us a room with a spectacular view of the city.  The room was small but immaculately clean.  We received great service with regard to our every concern.  The hotel concierge was sweet and VERY helpful with regard to all our event planning.  Perhaps our favorite part in staying here was the incredible buffet breakfast - you must try it!  A phenomenal selection of delicious foods, and the crepes and fresh omelets were especially to die for.  Finally, you just can't beat the location!  We couldn't recommend this hotel more highly."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and staying in a KING Corner Suite. Upon checking in the front desk was very kind and accommodating. I got into my room and overall it is ok. Not a $300 per night room. The shower is a tough sell for me. I feel like I should be wearing shoes in it. A little bleach and caulking can go a long way! They really need to take care of the shower. On a separate note I ordered room service, the customer service was great and the food was good. I only have French Fries and a Fruit Plate-$37 but consider it was room service. I still don't think my fruit plate was worth $12. 3-Star Room 4-Star Service"}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped out of our cab we received excellent service. We checked in easily and the clerk even too the time to give us directions to the restaurant that we were going to later that night because the concierge was on break. The hotel conspired with my husband to deliver a slice of cheesecake to our room for our wedding anniversary. When we come back to Montreal, we will definitely stay at this hotel."}
{"text":"Had 3 days of business meetings recently here last week. We were in the St Laurent room in the basement. Room was setup just as we had requested for the week. Maitre D was very attentive and accommodating. Continental breakfast was a bit on the skimpy side but not horrible. Lunches were exquisitely prepared and with excellent selection that had wonderful salads and always a fish option for lunch! Everyone mentioned the food was wonderful!   Hotel rooms were very comfortable and I had a spectacular view on the 22nd floor.   Location is excellent!"}
{"text":"L'hôtel et le personnel sont fantastiques ! Le stationnement par contre... C'est une descente infernale presque interminable..."}
{"text":"I would have given them a 5'star rating but an incident doesn't allow me to do so. I had asked to clean the shower after I discovered mold. Nothing was done that day or the day after. Too bad as this hotel is really nice but there is a flaw in the internal communication."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We booked this hotel to have a pool close by for my young nephew. It is listed as a hotel amenity. We arrived and are told it's under construction and we have to go next door- not convenient with a toddler!  We were also charged exhorbitant extra fees of $150 that we're hidden by Priceline in the hotel taxes. After hours of talking and emailing with Priceline and the hotel, Priceline blames the hotel and the hotel blames Priceline, I am left in the middle and out the money. We asked the hotel for some type of reasonable compensation, like breakfast, they refused.  update: cleaning service took one of the bathrobes and didn't replace it (a problem, because you get charged for it if it is missing), one of the towels they provided was filthy with what looked like hardened toothpaste, the tv is very small/cheap and the remote works poorly, and they only give you late checkout if you are an elite member.   Not 4 star quality. I won't be staying here again and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed by the folks. Passive aggressive times deux. The rooms were worn and dated. IC should pull the brand from this property. Location was ok though."}
{"text":"Internet is terrible. Just shuts off leaving you with phone charges you probably aren't expecting...  Late night menu is terrible if they even have anything.  Bar closes too early.  Room service is way too expensive for what little you get. What's the point of staying here when there are better hotels for the same price around the corner?  - This place could be great but they don't seem to care about the customer here."}
{"text":"I recently found myself facing a birthday milestone of sorts, so like any level-headed person, I chose escapism to avoid any office brouhahas and off-key singing. By pure happenstance, I wound up at this InterContinental (it was part of an Expedia package), but let me tell you -- it was a week of pure heaven. First of all, you're just steps from Old Town, so surrounded by breathtaking architecture. It's conveniently Metro-adjacent, flawlessly decorated, and staffed with service-oriented professionals who spoil you rotten. I literally wanted to have my bed, park view, and luxurious bathroom shipped home with me. While this hotel stay was not of my choosing when I booked my trip, you can rest assured I'll now be purposely staying at this chain again and again."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! Was in Montreal with a few friends last month and we were so happy with this place. Modern, elegant decor throughout the whole hotel. The service was great, and best of all, we ended up paying less than we were expecting. The view of the city from our room was stunning. The room was very quiet, clean, and upscale. The absinth bar was interesting and a good place to go for a drink without leaving the hotel. Free wifi. In a location convenient to Vieux-Port. I would absolutely stay here again."}
{"text":"Booked an online reservation for a stay at intercontinental Montreal. The lobby is located in the second floor. You need to take the escalators up. The staffs are really friendly.   We stayed here for 5 days in a corner king room with a view. Got an exclusive upgrade for about $20 to get an executive suite. It was also in the corner. Room 2000. The room was very spacious. We had two tvs, one in the room and one in the living room area. The washroom was big and spacious. There was a tub and a standing shower.  The rooms were a little dim though.   There was free wifi and We had access to the club lounge. Breakfast was offered to us in the lounge from I think 7am till 10:30. They had a variety of breakfast foods and drinks. The cookies and croissants were really good. Very fresh and soft. The club lounge card allows us to access it any time we want. All you can drink for things like coffee, tea, soft drinks and water. From 5-7pm there was all you can drink alcohol. There's a variety of beer and wines you can choose from. It was pretty worth it.    As for room service. Food was horrible. It tasted like microwaved frozen food. Not worth. But the only option if you're hungry in the early morning or late nights.   There was also a cafe located right under the hotel. They have really good sandwiches.   Besides the rooms being a little old, there was not much to complain. Overall great experience ! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Fantastic stay at this great hotel! I stayed using points from my IHG account. Had a great corner room with a nice view. The bed was comfortable, and the room was nice and spacious. It was very comfortable and would stay again. The parking lot was deep underground. I parked 12 floors deep, very interesting."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Intercontinental for two nights over New Years with our three kids. We really liked our room and thought the location was great!  The room was a good size and clean. My husband and I also ate dinner and had cocktails in the lobby bar. We loved the friendly staff and the food and drinks were delicious. Our only suggestion would be to make the exercise room larger and more updated and possibly add a hot tub in that area as well. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"* Mixed emotions *  Fortunately I had to go to Montreal.  Unfortunately many of the hotels I usually stay at were booked or overpriced.  Surprisingly the Intercontinental was available and priced reasonably.    Fortunately there was only 1 person in front of me on line at check-in.  Unfortunately it took about 15 minutes before the front desk was able to check me in.    Surprisingly they upgraded me to a suite and pointed me to the elevator without offering assistance.      Fortunately I never say yes when offered to have assistance to go to the room.  Unfortunately this was a rare case where I could have used the assistance!  When I got into the room I couldn't figure out how to turn on the lights even though I am fairly technically savvy.  It took 10 minutes to figure out that many of the lights had individual switches and were not on a central circuit.      Surprisingly there was a plate of freshly baked macaroons and a bottle of mineral water to welcome me.  Fortunately the room was large with a separate bedroom and living room.    Unfortunately the workdesk had a chair that was likely invented by the Marquis de Sade.    Surprisingly even though the property was recently renovated it is already showing signs of wear, including wall paper starting to peel in the washroom.    Fortunately the concierge staff was really knowledgeable about the local area and made several very solid recommendations.   Unfortunately housekeeping was a bit sloppy (found a hole in a towel, a bit of dust on the desk, and no bath mat on my first night).  Since these were all minor I didn't bother calling in about them.      Surprisingly housekeeping varied each day and was not very consistent.  I was surprised that the empty plate from the macaroons which had a flower and some chocolate sauce garnish was left in the room for 2 days before being taken away.  Some days you would get turndown service (some not).  One day they took away an almost empty tissue box but didn't replace it with new tissues.  One day they threw out a perfectly good bar of soap which was in the shower, while other days they let me use a bar of soap more than once (thankfully).  Some days you would get a newspaper, others you would not.  Some days they would leave all of the lights on in the room, some not.  Some days they would replace the tea for the automated tea/coffee machine, some not.  Some days they would put a bucket of ice in the room, some not.  I got the impression it was just a crapshoot each day when they serviced the room!  All issues were minor, so I did not complain about them.  But they were noticeable.    Fortunately the room came with access to the club room.  Unfortunately my key didn't work for access until I went to the front desk to get it fixed.  Surprisingly the club room didn't have a lot in it except during breakfast and happy hour.  Fortunately the club room did have breakfast and some items were nice like the fresh berries.    Unfortunately some items were really low quality like the scrambled eggs which tasted mealy (I'm guessing powdered?).  Surprisingly even the baked goods like croissant and bagels (which are both Montreal specialties) were more like supermarket variety.    Fortunately the hotel offers an \"instant service button\" on the phone.  Unfortunately when you press the button it just rings and rings and rings.  I found that if you dialed 0 you got through though, but the instant service button must be going to a bad extension!  Surprisingly wake up calls were not always on time.  Some came as much as 15 minutes late - not reliable.  In fact one day after I happened to wake up (even though the wake-up call did not come) I went down to eat breakfast and then came back to the room to get ready to leave and there was a pounding at the door (about 45 minutes after the initial wake up call request).  Apparently since they called late and I didn't answer (since I was already downstairs at the time I had originally planned) they were worried I somehow died in the room or something.  Hm......  Overall the location is decent if you need to be near the convention centre, the pricing is reasonable for the area, and it isn't a terrible hotel.  Sometimes they shined, but sometimes they did not.  The non-consistency for a chain hotel is quite surprising.  I likely would not choose to come back when next in Montreal.  There are definitely better more consistently reliable options available."}
{"text":"First thing: do sign up for the Intercontinental Club upgrade! $10 a day is well worth it. It comes with included breakfast and afternoon tea in their lounge.  The room we got is beautiful, facing towards the fountain in the complex across, overlooking the multi-coloured glass walled convention center. Very well decorated. This being a business class hotel, did not have amenities such as a microwave which would have been most helpful for families with young kids.  Location-wise, it is great. 10-15 minutes walk to downtown shopping areas, to the Chinatown area and to the old port area. It is also in between two Metro stations, Square-Victoria and Place D'Armes. A short ride from the Biodome/Olympic Park and to LaRonde.  This hotel is also right on top of one part of the Underground City, which features shops along the number of connected Metro stations."}
{"text":"Stayed here for 4 days 3 nights and had a nice stay here even though there was one night when the electricity went out on a few floors but they were able to accommodate and upgraded me to a better room quickly. The hotel is located right next to a underground city which is connected to the metro and is a few blocks from the Notre-Dame. Would definitely recommend the hotel if your looking for someplace nice."}
{"text":"What a dump. This hotel screams 1972.  I can't believe this hotel gets to use the IHG brand.   The rooms are cheap and dark. The bathroom looks like it belongs in a hostel.   Gross."}
{"text":"Super location!  Close to everything either by walking or the Victoria Square Metro.  Nice place with all the amenities.  Super friendly and polite staff. Very helpful when needed.  Bartender was a lot of fun. Nice little park across the street for people watching. About 4 blocks to the music fests. Shopping restaurants anything you want to do is easy to get to. Recommended?  I would stay there again so YES!"}
{"text":"Easily the most luxurious hotel I've ever stayed in.  There are a lot of options for lodging on our long weekend getaways to Montreal, but we keep coming back here.  It is a large international chain, so yes, it does lack the charm of a boutique hotel, but when I can score a room here for a scant $120/night over a holiday weekend, it's hard to argue.    The rooms have what I'll call an understated regal quality, with deep reds and gold motif.  They're fairly spacious and can offer some very nice city views.  Our first stay here our room overlooked the park just outside next to the very colorful Palais des Congrés de Montreal.  The bathroom was amazing with a large tub and separate glass door shower.  The shower was not quite big enough for two (scandalous!) but looked fabulous.  I'm also a fan of the bath products and make sure to ask for extras to take home.  The brand is Agraria and it's their lemon verbena scent.  I'm generally not too into scents, but I love using this shampoo, it just smells so damn invigorating.   Our second stay we were given an interior room overlooking the glass rooftop of the enclosed corridor between the hotel and the building behind it along with glimpses of the river in the background.  Not as good, but still nice and considering the price we paid, no complaints here.  I was slightly disappointed on our second visit to not have a room with separate tub and shower and instead, one with a very standard combo with a curtain.  Room #2 just wasn't as elegant as room #1.  Maybe we were upgraded our first time and just didn't know it?  The lobby is large, with a decent amount of seating and some interesting decor.  I also love the faux fur panels on the wall as you go down the escalator and the black and white plates displayed on the wall near the bar area.  Check-in has always been painless, though this may have a lot to do with arriving close to 10 pm each time, having driven up from the Boston area.  Staff is very much bilingual, so English-only speakers should have no issues.  The location is great, as it's very close to all your major tourist stuff in Old Montreal, shopping (or other activities) along St Catherine, not to mention, you can get on the Metro without setting foot outside.  Parking is not cheap, I believe $25/night for self park, or $35 or valet.  If you plan to do any driving around, do the valet, as the hourly parking fee applies each time you go in and out, a lesson I learned the hard way once.  Of course, this past trip we opted for valet and never use the car once, wasting $30 over the course of three nights.  Oh well, c'est la vie!"}
{"text":"We stayed here in the summer a few months after we got married, and loved it! This hotel was perfection!! From checking-in, to hotel staff, our room, room service. Everything was perfect!   The room was fairly spacious, the bed was so comfortable once you lie down you don't want to get up (which could pose as a bad thing if you want to sight see :)). The room could be kept dim if you want to take a nap in the day; and there were more than enough lights to brighten up while getting ready to head out. I hate the hotels where the drapes allow all the light in, if your traveling, you don't always have a regular schedule.   We ordered Nachos late at night as room service and ordered a pay per view movie and enjoyed the late night snack.  Hotel is located in old Montreal, which is great for sight seeing, going for a walk and enjoying Montreal. It is still fairly close to downtown Montreal but is a bit away from the downtown hustle-bustle.   Overall, loved the experience and would def stay at Intercontinental again!"}
{"text":"Two days in a row my husband and I left the room around 10 and returned around 5 to discover that our room had not been straightened up.  Each time that we called to complain we were treated rudely and told it must be our fault for leaving a do not disturb sign on the door, which we had not.  The hotels is centrally located, which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Overall a nice stay. Biggest complaints: I found the rooms quite dark and the bathroom felt very cold. Room was cleaned well and toiletries restocked each time. The TV was glitchy - perhaps low battery in remote or poor Internet connectivity. Room service was fine but expensive. Charging electronics seemed to take forever.  Really enjoyed the absinthe bar and took advantage of the connection to the indoor shopping area."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Old Montreal, within a couple of blocks of Saint-Catherine shopping and the Place Des Arts.  I stayed here for one night on pleasure.  It's worth noting that I stayed with a Living Social coupon for $185/night plus tax, which is essentially 50% off.  I also know other travellers who have gotten a room for $200/night on Priceline.com.  I would NOT pay the $300-$350/night they ask on the website as full-price.  That being said, they gave us a beautiful, larger corner room.  There wasn't much view (other than the windows of adjacent buidlings), but the room was luxurious, with a nice, large washroom (including separate standing shower and bathtub).  Service was excellent, and I have no complaints.  While people seem to complain about the expensive wifi, I was able to use wifi for free while in my room.  It switched to a pay-policy when in the lobby or restaurants.  Not sure why...  The hotel also has a fantastic restaurant (Osco!), and a fun absinthe bar (Sarah B.).  I would recommend this restaurant, assuming you can get a deal on the room price."}
{"text":"Decent hotel in a great location.  Check in was quick and easy. I had booked a double but was upgraded to a single king with a \"view\" (which ended up just being a view of another building). We didn't get much for being Spire Elite which is kind of disappointing. The highest levels in other hotel reward programs at least get breakfast included.  The lobby was modern and sleek. The room itself definitely could use an upgrade. A lot of old furniture and a dark, musty feel. The bathroom was nice though, a separate shower and tub is always appreciated.  We didn't take advantage of the pool and gym, although they were available.   The hotel is close to Old Montreal and the Basilica, so it's a great spot if you want to be near the heart of Montreal."}
{"text":"Super bel hôtel! Le personnel est vraiment aimable et super compréhensif. Les lits sont vraiment confortables, tout est propre, l'entretien ménager est super, le petit centre d'entrainement est bien fait et a répondu à mes attentes ainsi que la piscine au sel. Je n'ai pas essayé le restaurant mais il m'a l'air populaire, ainsi que le bar. Il y a accès au Wi-fi aux chambres. J'ai passé un beau séjour de 3 jours et je reviendrais dormir ici lors de prochains voyages à Montréal si l'occasion se présente."}
{"text":"Here on business- conference in hotel. Conference food was superb.  Room and sound system AV system was good as well. Service was great, Room was outstanding-  bed was the most comfortable i have seen in a hotel.  View from my room was excellent, but its a city of course.  Understated elegance- very different from the W around the corner. This is a quiet and relaxing place, Health club is adequate, good lap pool. Winter pricing was extremely competitive but the prices in the bar and resturant were high."}
{"text":"Neither myself nor my partner had ever been to Montreal before.  I know, I know.  This hotel was a great jumping off place for us to get situated & learn our bearings of the city.  It's right down the block from the Square-Victoria metro stop (& technically you don't even have to go outside to get there!  You can utilize an underground passage.)  It's also close to Vieux-Port & Old Montreal.  The lobby itself included faux fur, sequins, & zebra print.  It was...err, interesting.  No free wifi - $10 for two hours or $15 for a day.  Seemed a bit skimpy in comparison to the image they were presenting otherwise.  The water pressure in the shower was excellent.  Why have I been settling for subpar pressure in our own apartment washroom?"}
{"text":"The hotel in general is nice.  It is not far from the old town.  It is also not far from a Metro station although it took me a while to find out where it was.  I got a double upgrade to a suite room with a nice view though my Ambassador membership.  The room furnitures were out dated though.    The lounge room food was very limited. It had the least food variety compared to all other Intercontinental I stayed before.  The staff in the lounge room was very friendly though.  It was probably not worthy to specifically booking a room with lounge access."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our stay. Beautiful decor in lobbies, halls and rooms. Bathrooms and pool area are a little outdated and I don't believe there is a spa/hot tub which would have been nice. Our room on the 20th floor had a great view. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant Osco was delicious and the late dinner ordered to our room was prompt."}
{"text":"We stayed here for 3 night for Canada's Day. We arrived late night and the check-in went smoothly. We were on the 11th floor but our view from the window is not that great... The room was rather large with a desk, big screen tv and very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom is large and has a separate bathtube and shower. The place is very clean and roomy.  The location of the hotel is great. It's close to the Square Victoria metro stop as well as Chinatown and old Montreal. It's about a 10min walk to rue St. Catherine and 20min to McGill/Mont Royal.  Overall this place is a great place to stay."}
{"text":"This hotel has a very nice manager. I booked it for a birthday weekend for my husband and his buddies. I didn't realize I hadn't booked double beds until the night before. Although they couldn't accommodate since the rooms were sold out, they offered kings with sofa beds. I wanted to cancel after the time limit and the manager did this for me with no fees or penalties. This is enough to make me want to stay here next time!!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst InterContinental property I have ever stayed at. Having been an IHG member for several years, I typically go with InterContinentals in any city I visit. This past Friday, we arrived early for check-in and were generously upgraded to some room on the 26th floor (awesome, we think..how nice of the hotel). Upon returning at 4:30 to finally enter our room, we were brusquely told that an Ambassador status guest had bumped us from the room. Bummed but not overly dejected, I accepted this as standard procedure. From here on it, it just goes completely down-freaking-hill. The following occurred during our stay:  -Entered the room to find the TV broken. Took a short while for the repairman to come by and fix it. Whatever, no worries.  -We waited nearly 30 minutes before our luggage was brought up...ok...fine, maybe this hotel's just understaffed.  -Then we find a dirty toothbrush hanging out under the sink in the bathroom. Ok...wtf.  -At this point I'm just pissed. But whatever, no need to gripe about this now.  -The next morning, we wake up early and leave the hotel (around 9am) and return at 1pm...and given the caliber of hotel, I'm expecting the room to be cleaned upon our arrival. Evidently, this was asking for too much, as we came back to the same room, untouched and uncleaned. THEN we leave again and return to the room at 4:30pm and the room STILL wasn't cleaned.  -At this point, I ask for the manager, and it takes a solid 1.5 hours for her to arrive on the scene, quoting \"another customer complaint\" as the reason for her delay. For 1.5 hours? Was this other guest's room literally on fire? The entire conversation I had with this manager lasted 10 minutes and I thought I had a slew of complaints. What on earth happened to the other guy???  Anyway, simply put, this hotel is an abomination, and it is indisputably the worst InterContinental I've stayed at. The staff/service/etc. can mess up the first time and recover accordingly. What I can't handle is laziness and clear apathy. Never staying here ever again and I don't recommend anyone else to either."}
{"text":"The hotel is downtown Montréal and in close walking distance to a metro and Chinatown. The lobby is located on the second floor. The front desk agent that checked me in was friendly and cheerful. The room I had was spacious with a sitting area and large bathroom. The bed was super comfy and I slept so well. There's a pool/fitness area on the 10th floor with several cardio machines, a few weight machines and dumbbells. I can imagine that the hotel gets very busy with all those different meeting spaces listed."}
{"text":"I had a lovely stay here; nice spacious corner room on the club lounge level.  Quiet, great view, and large bathroom.  I missed the usual Intercontinental slippers though!  Bathrobe was there!  It is borderline dated, but very clean.   I found the front desk staff to be really friendly.  But, my favorite people were the Club Lounge staff.  Franco, Rick, and there was a woman that worked a few mornings were outstanding.  They also provide room service, and so they are constantly running around.  I'm not sure why such a nice hotel is so short on staff, but you need to give these people a break.  They should be attending to the lounge and all the people sneaking in.  Which, is a big problem.  The lounge is located just off the lobby, and many non-paying guests were helping themselves; just easily sneaking into it when the doors opened.  It needs to be more closely monitored.  Some guests took advantage of the space and the food.  It was a little disturbing.    I did not love the bar in the hotel.  Service was friendly, but not that great.  And the food was not good at all.    Location is great.  Very close to old town, and for me, within walking distance of the great shopping and museums (if you don't want to walk, you can Uber it for less than $10 to just about all the sites in town)."}
{"text":"We used Hotwire to try to get this Hotel, and succeeded. The trick is pay attention to their trip advisor rating and cross reference it with their star rating. anywho..   1- Room: They gave us a really nicely sized room, on a high floor with a large bathroom.- which some Hotels don't tend to do with Hotwire reservations, or usually try to give you the bare minimum.   2- Location:  It's a nice little downtown neighborhood of \"Vieux-Montreal\" which is old Montreal. The restaurants around the block are pretty nice, and you'll find an assortment of traditional French cuisine.    3- Transportation: There's a Metro Station connected to the Hotel in the \"Montreal World Trade Center\" annex thingy   4- Staff: Sweet, Kind and speak English- which came in handy for my better half  5- Amenities:  - Pool: Was ok, but not what I expected out of IHG - Sauna:  Needs a little update - Gym: Needs a little TLC and update as well  6- On site restaurant: Do not eat at the restaurant- unless you're starved and everything is close. The food is mediocre and priced as you'd expect at an IHG Hotel. The Absinte Bar, on the other hand is a must. The drinks are amazing, and quite potent. The bartender is really sweet and cordial.    Overall, I did enjoy my stay at IHG, and would recommend it. However, I think they need to update their \"spa.\"   TIP: Signup for their rewards program (it's free) and they'll waive the price of their $15/night WIFI.   ---- BONUS: Oddity of the \"Montreal World Trade Center.\" The Hotel is right next to the St James Hotel and the area between them is enclosed to create some sort of retail/fast-food/ fine dining/ office spaces? It's nice during the winter - when we went- because they attempt give the allure of the outdoors inside. You must check it out."}
