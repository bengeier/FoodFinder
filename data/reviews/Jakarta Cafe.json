{"text":"Maggie cooks up some great Indonesian food. You have to try the peanut sauce with curry."}
{"text":"We ate at the Jakarta Cafe food truck last night at Sandburg Elementary, Madison, WI. It was a mix.
The egg rolls were great. The Mango smoothie wasn't cold enough. There was no ice in it. So, the smoothie was too warm on a warm day. The chicken fried rice was too dry. The chicken was dry and the rice was very dry. My wife observed that the rice was cooked in a microwave. The chicken fried rice seemed old and had sat for a while.
$20."}
{"text":"This was gross and WAY over priced! I have a feeling I'll be paying for eating this tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We found this place but closed. Then called Maggie she was pretty  nice told us and cooked for us at home and delivered told us. Peanut curry appetizer,Dumplings, chicken curry and one more beef dish I forgot the name. It taste great!! And thanks for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"The vegan option was not that good -- basically potatoes and rice and some flavoring. The spring roll was not bad, but very greasy. It was okay for food cart fare, but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Total rip off for food that is mediocre at best. Chicken curry is $10 for something that is nearly all rice, and the curry is almost all cheap root vegetables with an off flavor. And when you order, the server asks if you want spring roll like it comes with it but it's actually a separate $6 thing. And then she gives you your change with singles like she deserves a tip. There are too many other good food carts around here for this place. Skip it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. The chicken curry with peanut hash browns is a sweet spicy delight; the beef dish was soft and tangy; the veggie spring rolls crispy on the outside  and moist and tender inside. Then you should know about the delicious lemonade and the excellent smoothie. 
What a treat to escape to Southeast Asia for just the cost of a meal!"}
