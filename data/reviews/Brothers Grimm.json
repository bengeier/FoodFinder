{"text":"The service is amazing! The drinks are in expensive and great. And the food is spectacular, particularly the burgers and the wings. The whole place has turned around in the last few years. I would suggest to anyone who had a poor food and/or poor service experience give it one more try."}
{"text":"Service poor, drinks poor, kitchen poor.

Arrived and seated ourselves at a table about 7pm on a Saturday. Should have realized since it wasn't bustling, it wasn't a good idea.

Waitress came over and brought menu and left before taking a drink order. She came back to take the drink order. Within the time it took to order two drinks and an appetizer, she wiped her hand across her nose at least 5 times (I stopped counting.) Not sure if it was a new nose ring or whether she had an itch, but it was a turn off. When I wanted to order an appetizer the same time as the drinks, she asked that I hold on, she wouldn't be able to remember 3 things (complex drink order consisted of Windsor and coke, plus a beer).  She took my credit card and came back with drinks (sans bar naps) and now wanted to know what we wanted for appetizer/food order.
 
Grimm Platter with variety of fried foods served only with ketchup and small side of marinara. Marinara only came about 5 minutes into eating it. The cauliflower, zucchini and mushrooms would have benefited from more than ketchup. The marinara barely covered the cheese sticks. Kitchen could do better.

For second round of drinks I asked if they could do a margarita (dive bar), and she said she wasn't sure she remembered how (bottled mix- how tough is that?), but other bartender/waitress did. Fine, ordered rocks, no salt. I also ordered a Rachel.

Maragarita was fine, albeit a bit light on tequila, but adequate.  Rachel came out and she announced as a Rachel, but it was clearly a Rueben. So much for the kitchen knowing the difference between corned beef and turkey, sauerkraut and coleslaw. 

At this point I just accepted it as kitchen error without complaint. I ordered another margarita, rocks no salt.

Waitress arrived with pink concotion. I asked what is this and she said it was like a margarita, but she added something most people liked. One sip and I told her, NO, this is too sweet, I want a margarita. She replied she'd take it off the check be back with a margarita as ordered. 30 minutes passed and I got tired of waiting. Asked for check and told her, this pink thing is still sitting here, I want it off my check. She came back, placed check down and ran.

Sure enough that pink sweet drink was charged at cost of $7.50. I went to bar to argue. She said she could not take it off check that a manager had to do that and a manager was not there. \"But, I never ordered whatever that was.\" Her reply - it was only a margarita with a shot of grenadine.  \"Who does that?\" Some customers like it that way - which to me meant either they are too drunk to care or since she's young, cute and blonde they forgive her. Since they already had my credit card, I couldn't do anything but demand the drink I ordered. 

She arrived back at my table with margarita mix, sans tequila. It wasn't worth drinking mixer for $7.50. 

There was no reason for the crappy service and poor kitchen or lousy bar. A woman wiping  her nose, making your drink is NOT what you want to see. Getting drinks you can't swallow and didn't order and being charged for them is NOT what I signed up for last night.  Getting the inverse  sandwich and appetizers that aren't served with any sauces... what kind of place does that? BAD BAD BAD, all counts."}
{"text":"Went here for a drink and a snack with a friend. Granted its a bar, so all I was expecting was bar-food.  Wont be back. The beer selection is OK, at least compared to the food. The ambiance is middle-school dance. Why do places like this have a huge menu?? If they just did a few things well, they would be so much better. I ordered nachos. Nachos here means canned cheese product on stale chips with some canned black olives and diced tomato on the side. Not even jalapenos. Seriously, why did it take 10 minutes for these nachos to be delivered to our table?? Oh well, I didn't expect much, but you still only get 1 star Brothers Grimm. I'm guessing not many people eat here....at least I hope not."}
{"text":"Very old crowd and super expensive drinks. Not impressed by the band and crowd. We were by far the youngest crowd by 30 years and paying $5+ for a draft beer in Chicago style"}
{"text":"Where do I start.  The Good; it was spacious, no waiting for tables, drinks were delivered quickly, the waitress was attentive and personable.  The Bad; the food and mostly everything else!  There was no one there eating on a Saturday night.  I got the hamburger/ potatoes casserole...horrible.  The meat was sour smelling (bad hamburger).  I complained and they brought me a cheeseburger that was underdone.  Let's face it, it's a bad place for food.  My friend who had a Rueben got sick from it.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"We used to live five minutes from Brothers Grimm.  One of my first experiences at Brothers Grimm was in 4 inches of snow the owner was still charging a 5.00 cover for some cover band.  There was 30 people in the bar.  It was mid-February, cut your losses at that point.  This bar is below an apartment complex.  That is where the regulars come from as well as Moon/Robinson residents attempting to relive their youth!  

Food is frozen or out of a bag.  Drinks are so so at best.  Service is horrid!  Owner is taking his shot or two throughout the evening and just doesnt get it.  Nothing separates itself to make you want to visit!"}
{"text":"I was there for the \"lunch\" provided as part of the annual Montour Trail bike ride. I had been  on this ride maybe ~5 years ago and remembered the food at the end as being if not the highlight of the event, definitely something to look forward to. I understand that this time the organizers catered the food themselves, and not the restaurant. It's a shame; it could have been better had the restaurant done it.

It's just the right venue for this event's finale and doing it right would have really made the ride experience memorable. Let's hope they all manage to sort things out for next year.

{"text":"Not sure what everyone was complaining about.  Beer was 2.75 a pint.  Is that expensive?  
There was a band on Sunday when I was there and they were fine.  No cover.  They had some good songs and it was fun to have live music.  They had bbq so I didn't order off the menu. 
Seemed like a fine local bar."}
{"text":"I really hate leaving bad reviews, but this place was pretty bad.

Had a chicken parmesan sandwich.   Ice cold out of the fridge bun, frozen Tyson chicken Pattie,, straight out of the can tomato paste, and topped with a slice of cheese.

It did come with house made chips.   But I'm pretty sure they were made last week.  


Inside this place could be a very nice bar/resturant.

Cleanliness was slightly lacking, even my menu was sticky.

Then as we're paying for our meal, there's the bartender refilling a 5th bottle out of a half gallon of rum.    Right in front of every one!

Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the definition of a dive bar. Drinks are cheap, space is plentiful, and there's even a little wood burning stove out back if you want to go outside. Service is great in general. 

My only complaint, and why it lost a star, is the loud bands they let play on the weekends. People don't come to this bar to see crappy bands, so the least that the place could do is keep the volume down. But it's ear-splitting.

That's a lot of negativity, but in general I do love this place. Low key, nice staff, and low prices. Awesome neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Pretty decent dive bar. We came in on a Thursday night for a nightcap and had an inexpensive beer. We found a \"DJ\" there (just a table in the corner) with a bunch of folks line dancing which was entertaining and looked like fun. Didn't eat there this time, but wouldn't hesitate to try something if the time were right. Regulars were friendly and bar staff was attentive. Allegedly it gets packed, but it wasn't too busy this night."}
