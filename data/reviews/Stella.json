{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. The ambiance is great, the menu is simple  - every item is perfectly done...and they serve food late into the night."}
{"text":"One of Bloordale's best kept secrets. Stella is a stylish bar with great tasting home-style Indian food. My favourites are the butter chicken and fish curry (both costs $11.50)."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time last Sunday. Upscale decor with and service to match.The bartenders are so friendly that they have a following of neighborhood people that are so genuine that I felt like we were drinking in my living room. Great quality food for very reasonable prices and  Happy hour every day"}
{"text":"Instead of writing poor reviews, I usually keep my big mouth shut. Sadly I will make an exception for the newly opened Stella. My wife and I wanted to stop by for Happy Hour because we liked the former Central Bistro.  The restaurant itself has undergone subtle changes but it's still the same feel.  The new ownership group has a great rep.

Our waiter was nice enough, enthusiastic, and gave us good advice.  The beer on tap was pretty much what I run across.   The Goose Island Sophie was good. To be fair the wine list was undergoing changes, but the happy hour wine choices were underwhelming for the clientele in this area. (Tarbell's and The Tavern are across the street.)

Happy hour menu was pretty pedestrian, so we ordered from the menu. It's a shame that the menu's Starters weren't used for Happy Hour.  The all looked good.

Waiter recommended Beef Panini over the Meatball Sub.  Not bad at all.  My wife ordered a Shrimp & Grits (which she has become addicted to at Rusconi's) over the Arancini. And therein lies the the source of this poor review.  The shrimp was chewy and undercooked, i.e. translucent.  Our waiter took it back, chef brought out another. Apologized profusely.  Nice guy. 

The shrimp still were unedible. Wifey, who after years of reading food mags and cookbooks, swears shrimp should never be eaten when translucent.  I, who know nothing, took to the internet, which as you might guess was pretty much unhelpful.  But one discussion did say that peeled and de-veined frozen shrimp that have had an alkali rinse share this unpleasant quality. (http://www.city-data.com/forum/food-drink/2414388-translucent-shrimp-restaurant-frozen-chinese-crunchy.html#ixzz4KIBJDwNR)

The restaurant was kind enough to cover the charge, but wifey is very disappointed. We always liked this location.  Stay tuned we will try again and hopefully I can amend this review.  I'm rooting for this place."}
{"text":"Best bar for groups. Official backup plan bar of the neighbourhood. Sometimes the crowd is a little odd but a lot of times there's a good vibe. I've been here a few times after openings at Mercer Union and it was a lot of fun. Now has a patio in the summer. Also, I like that they serve curry."}
{"text":"Nope. Undercooked pork chop? Solution = Slice up and re-cook? Service not so good. Food not so good. Bill really not so good. One and done."}
{"text":"Ugh, the music was way too loud for conversation--in a room this size, you hardly need a sound system.  It's a cozy living room-sized bar: lots of mismatched chairs and dark walls, a single bartender, some cool drink specials (the Dark and Stormy?  YUM. And the bartender's pretty generous with the liquor).  It's a good place to go with people you don't really need to talk to--don't bring a first date here!"}
{"text":"Used to love Central Bistro and decided to give Stella a try and see how it compares.  Service was great; friendly staff.  Had the short rib pizza; sounded great but was lackluster; seemed like a frozen crust as opposed to fresh-made.  We were joking that they must be using DiGiorno; it wasn't that much different.    Just over-priced pizza at 18.00; we expected something on par with Bianco at that price but wan't close."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


This is a room near Bloor and Lansdowne that has a bar. There are tables and chairs. There is no air conditioning.

That is it. The vibe and your experience at Stella comes straight from the group you're with, or the entertainment of the night (acoustic performers or perhaps a DJ.)

I'm not even sure what I'm reviewing, because the venue itself only offers four walls and an exchange of drinks for money. If this is the kind of minimal service and atmosphere that hipsters feel the need to leave their living rooms for, then who am I to judge?

Oh wait, I'm me. This place will get tired very fast unless its owners go to the trouble of offering *something* to keep customers from losing interest. I'm not satisfied by Stella, but I'm curious to see where it goes.

2 stars"}
{"text":"I have to tell you there is no better neighborhood Italian place than Stella. Not only does the entire staff make you feel like you are a guest in their home but the food will leave you comforted for days. One part authentic one part modern - Stella doesn't disappoint in pasta, aroncini and pizza. Come in for the atmosphere, the daily happy hour and the music. Keep coming back for the amazing food and great prices. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Super close to home, my husband and our son used to ride our bikes to Central Bistro on the weekends, and it was one of our favorite happy hour spots. Service was quick and great even though they were busy. Decor looks nice, but I didn't think the old decor needed much updating. This is petty but I hate the sign out front, Central Bistro looked so quaint and the \"jazzy\" sign seems cheesy to me. We had the short rib pizza which was amazing. We will be back, would love to see better happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Stella. It's cute enough and it's right around the corner from my place. It's not bad, but it's not particularly good, either, and not a good value. I've had lunch and dinner there. I don't recall the lunch entree; the dinner was the prosciutto and arugula pizza. My choice was either that or the steak au poivre, which tells you more about the haphazard selection of dishes on the menu than it does about me, I think. The pizza was OK. It was also priced the same as a similar pizza from Pizzeria Bianco, which would have been much better. Where's Gordon Ramsay when you need him?"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, a real gem in a sketchy part of town. 

The bartender is delightful, the food is focused (curry dishes, veg and non) and extremely good. 

Only two beers on tap but they're both excellent (steam whistle and spear head). Also, plenty of bottles and tall boys. 

The dark and stormy is possibly the best mixed drink I've ever had. 

They have a great music and stand-up open mic as well. 

Go there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Shame on you and your three or less star reviews. Vince is fantastic and this place would easily become my local if it wasn't in the ass end of nowhere.

I haven't had the chance to try the food but that was because I made the mistake of eating somewhere else first and just needed more drinks. I'm glad we stumbled in here even if it wasn't trivia night (again, my fault because I got the dates wrong).

Try their dark and stormy if you like fresh lime in your drinks.

Other important details include, walls and ceiling to keep the elements outside where they belong. Washrooms at the back are a little dark and foreboding but clean and functional which is all that really matters.

I honestly can't understand why I haven't been back here yet and it's only been a week since I found out about it."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere reasonable prices great food and excellent customer service. Thank you for making it a special place for us to celebrate our special occasions."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent however we were waiting for a very long time for our curry before the server came, only to tell us that the cook just went out to buy an ingredient he was missing. I think we likely waited an hour in total."}
{"text":"Rude/non-existent service, nothing on tap (They have plenty of taps) but don't worry, they have $8 boring tall cans on special! Ambience is non-existent, with low-level music playing intermittently, only when the bartender could be bothered. I was last here a year and a half ago with none of these complaints. Will certainly never be back."}
{"text":"We made it inside and met up with friends, the place was quaint with an ecclectic retro affair -- decorated with cool pieces such old record players and a ghetto blasters from the 80s.

Vince the bartender..  was very polite and took care of all us in a timely manner. Super busy night for him.. no doubt. 

Very odd but curry's was the food offering at this bar. We tried the butter chicken and beef curry. Both excellent with rich flavours throughout. Drinks were alright. Wine was cheap at $6 

Cool place to hang out with unexpectedly good curry."}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from the San Francisco area, and we are always anxious to discover new restaurants.  On the recommendation of a friend, we UBER'd from the Westin KIerland to Stella.  It was definitely a memorable experience.

The service was excellent and the food was even better.  As the evening wound down Chef Robert added a personal touch and visited with us.  I asked about his background and was not surprised to hear that he was trained at the Culinary Academy in New York.

He truly is a talented chef.

This restaurant will be on our destination list the next time we visit the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I made reservations to take my mom and my daughter to Stella to celebrate Mother's Day. The restaurant called to confirm my reservation yesterday and we were all looking forward to a nice brunch...then we arrived at the restaurant. 
When we checked in, the hostess gave me a strange look and told me it would be a few minutes while she checked to see what she had available. This seemed strange since we had a reservation, but ok. She came back and said we could either sit on the patio (it's a hot Phoenix day) that provides absolute zero shade, or we could \"squeeze\" into a small table in the back (was actually a table for 2 and we had 3 adults) or we could sit at a large communal looking high top in the bar area.  They had music playing in the bar that was needlessly loud. My mother could not hear a word we said. When I asked the hostess why they didn't have a table for our reservation she said the reservation system wasn't setup correctly and had double booked the restaurant. I mentioned that the restaurant had called me yesterday to confirm and this was not mentioned. We could have modified our reservation yesterday if they had said something. She then told me that they had had several walk-in's and she had tried to \"save\" tables for reservations but took the walk-ins instead. Not sure what kind of customer service this provides. We ultimately decided to leave and go somewhere else to celebrate because we didn't want to sweat outside, squeeze into a table for 2 and actually wanted to be able to talk during brunch. The hostess didn't apologize or even offer a happy Mother's Day as we left. Didn't seem to upset to see us go!  It's too bad the restaurant is run so poorly!
Oh on a side note, as we left the restaurant I went onto Open Table to see where we could get last minute reservations since our reservations at Stella weren't honored. Imagine my surprise to see they were still accepting reservations for right now!  Reservation system can't be closed even when they won't honor the reservation?  What a scam!"}
{"text":"I always enjoyed Central Bistro and was excited to experience what new things Stella would offer. I stopped in for an early dinner on a Tuesday night. The menu looked promising, with lots of Italian-themed appetizers and entrees. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs, a margarita pizza, and goat cheese with wild mushroom bruschetta. The pizza was ok but nothing great - really just the standard wood-fired pizza available anywhere in town. The bruschetta looked beautiful, but the goat cheese was cold, thick, under-seasoned and goopy. Combined with the cold marinated wild mushrooms, the texture combination was less than enjoyable. But what really ruined the experience was the pasta. At an upscale Italian restaurant on Camelback road, I expect high quality marinara sauce, fresh pasta and deliciously seasoned and textured meatballs. Instead the sauce was thin/almost watery, very sweet, and tasted exactly like sauce in canned Chef-Boy-Ardee Spaghettios. The pasta was standard dry supermarket spaghetti. The meatballs were decent, but nothing to get excited about. We left most of the pasta on the plate as well as one of the bruschetta. Next time I'm looking for pasta or pizza I will head to North, Tomaso's, or Base."}
{"text":"Had a perfect lunch at Stella's today. The ahi salad was shear perfection. Artichoke appetizer  amazing and the wait staff was on top of their game. I never had to ask for a single thing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night meal and drink, and was not disappointed! Randomly stumbling into this bar, ordered the shrimp and green beans, as well as the veggie plate. Both came with curry and rice, cooked beautifully. Veggie plate came with egg plant, potato, cabbage, curry and rice. Had a curry flavor throughout, a good amount of spice to leave you reaching for your beer, not too spicy to ask for a glass of milk. The shrimp and green beans was the spiciest, but even then not overly spicy. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nice reboot from central bistro.  Nice casual menu with good upscale specials. .  Great salads and good entrees.  Staff is very friendly and attentive. Shawntel was the best. Ambiance has always been good. We will definately be back...might even add to the dining rotation."}
{"text":"We came for a late lunch yesterday and because of the morons over at the Artizen, we are here again. Service was great both times. A few minor tweaks and they will get 5 stars.  Need more vegetarian dishes for brunch (or be able to tweak it)."}
{"text":"Terrible service, no water refills, ran out of what we ordered, too dark to even see your food, microwaved salmon, underdressed salad, sour artichokes, chicken over salted, overpriced... could go on. Will not be going back. Awful."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. This food is absolutely incredible, some of the best traditional Indian food I've ever had. Great staff. Cheap drinks, large variety. Stella rocks my socks"}
{"text":"Great location, food and service!
If you like Gin, to be sure to try the Uptown cocktail. Follow that up with the tuna appetizer and you will not be disappointed. Last night, I got to taste the filet, salmon, and the pork chop. They were all delicious and perfectly prepared. Each plate came with lovely sides. We are very excited to have Stella in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Place was good when it was Central Bistro.. Stella's menu is over priced and food is sub par at best. Go to Tarbell's for same price and better food."}
{"text":"I like this place! Our waitress told us that the new owners have been in for 6 months. They changed the layout a bit and it feels very open. Even inside seating has a nice outdoor feel because the windows are huge and open. Nice patios and lights and atmosphere. Excellent happy hour menu. Good food and drink selection. Nice neighborhood place."}
{"text":"I was here on a Tuesday so the place is dead. As part of the pub crawl we didn't miss the crowd as we were decent sized group. This place was like an oven on hot summer day like today. They do have a single fan which didn't help much (needless to day when its cooler outside than inside there is something wrong) Beer selection is ok but I guess you can only use beer as cooling method for little bit. I would go there if I am in the area (unlikely) otherwise there are better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just an excellent experience.. we had lunch here and just loved the food and ambiance. Panini was wonderful.. seasoned fries divine. The artichoke appetizer was a perfect choice and the bartender was beyond compare. Her name was Jodi and she made our drinks perfectly. She was a doll.. would definitely recommend.. can't wait to get back to try the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Decent Music selection. Pitchers were a tad pricey at 24$. My buddy had the curry burger and said it was really good. I'd come back but probably stick to mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Tried the new Stella after Central Bistro. Loved the food. Meatballs (ground and with brisket), bolognese and the charcuterie board (fantastic!). The service by Lexi was awesome! We will be back and will tell our friends to give the new Stella a try."}
{"text":"Was in here for the crawl. Yes, it was only the one visit and yes this place is seriously in the middle nowhere... if you live anywhere but in the hood.

The bartender was friendly, the beer was fine but for what I saw this place was not different than any other divey looking bar. 

Standard bar, tall chairs, short chairs, cheaper looking decor. No idea on the food status (typical of me of most bars) and the place just seemed 'alright.'

However going all the way to Lansdowne for just an alright bar is not alright. Just not worth it. 

If you live in the hood than you got yourself your typical watering hole and I would recommend it. Mind you the pickings around this hood... well, just remember the old sayin' \"In the land of the blind, the one with one eye is king.\" It applies here.

Fun fact: 11 years ago, I lived 2 blocks north of this joint for 6 months! Would have visited more often had I known about it."}
{"text":"A great spot for a drink with friends.

We came here a while back for Avitania's birthday celebration. This was an ideal spot. The bartender was super nice, made great drinks, and didn't seem to mind that we took over the whole place and rearranged all the furniture. 

They also have curry on the menu, and the curry is indeed very very tasty. Somehow, I didn't feel self conscious scarfing down a big plate of vegan curry while everyone else was drinking beer. 

The place feels like you're hanging out in your friend's cool parents' basement. They even had the same record player I had as a kid! Part of me wonders if it was actually the one I grew up with..."}
{"text":"Glad to see this spot (formally Central Bistro) open up again..a little more low key then most places on Camelback..it has a great vibe with a good happy hour. I will still never understand a new place that doesn't ask \"Have you been here before?\" but that is just me railing against the machine. 

It will become a regular spot on my rotation."}
{"text":"Awful service and bad food. Took 20 minutes for anyone to approach our table after being seated, and that was only because we had to ask the hostess to send someone over. Ordered a burger and Caesar salad. Burger came out red, and Caesar was brought as a side, not the full salad we CLEARLY asked for. They ruined Central Bistro."}
{"text":"I hesitated a bit to write a review about this place.  I've been here three times, usually on a Saturday night and it's never been crowded.

The main reason for this review is the awesome bartender they've got there! I don't remember his name, but he's British, friendly and easy to talk to.

He makes great drinks too!

This is a great place to bring friends and make new ones!"}
{"text":"It was decent til the strawberry shortcake dessert.  

We went for the 20 for bottle of wine and pizza/charcuterie.  Firstly you have to sit in the bar area to order this which is lame and outdated.  You get a 10 dollar bottle of wine and a solid pizza for 20 bucks.  The goat cheese bruschetta isn't bad.  I wouldn't get the strawberry shortcake though, you get a day old biscuit with some strawberry topping with grill marks (char) on it with like 2 drops of whipped cream on it.  Overall, I don't see a reason to return.  We'll miss the $1 oysters at Central Bistro."}
{"text":"This place fairly new so my review may change if we decide to go back. First off, it's LOUD and quite DARK. Second, the service was not great as we waited a good 15 minutes before a server came over and he forgot to put in our side of Brussel sprouts so those never came. The food was ok. Shrimp and grits were very heavy in tomato sauce but still edible and the kale salad was a mound of kale and not much else.  It's right in our neighborhood and has a nice patio area to sit when the weather cools a bit."}
{"text":"My favorite Happy Hour spot. Great food, exceptional service and Wednesday you can get a pizza and a bottle of wine for $20. And the pizza is fantastic! If you haven't been to Stella, give it a try."}
{"text":"What a great spot. Restaurant opened not too long ago and it's right across the street from our office. Nice selection on the menu. Beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"We loved Central Bistro and were sorry to see that it changed; however, Stella is quite amazing too luckily!  We stopped in for brunch a few weekends ago and really enjoyed it -great quality of food, great atmosphere and great service.  We enjoyed the bottomless mimosas (dangerous, but good) and I did a make your own egg white omelette with ham, onions, mushrooms, artichokes and mozzarella - so tasty!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service! Stopped in Friday night around 11:30pm and Andrea the bartender was so inviting and personable! Made a reservation to come back with a larger group next weekend!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like Stella.

My husband and I came here for dinner during their opening week. With brick walls, slab marble tables, a visible kitchen, a swanky bar area and dim Edison bulb lighting, the atmosphere is sleek and modern.

As a vegetarian, I always look at menus online prior to going to a new place to ensure there will be options. When we arrived, the menu that was handed to us was quite different from the one on their website. Additionally, our server immediately informed us that an entire category of the menu was unavailable, as well as several items from each of the other sections. I understand that it was their first week open, but to hand someone a menu and then tell them that ten plus items cannot be made gives off a lack of preparation. As for the food we were able to order, the portions and presentation were lackluster, but the creativity and flavor were certainly there.

I would love to give Stella the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they just opened earlier than they should have, but overall, I was left wanting something more from such a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Saturday night  \"Friend's and Family \" soft opening  was a great success we were able to get several items on the menu so we could share. Each bite was a great experience in what we hope will be a great addition to our favorite places to go. The wine selection was beautiful and signature drinks were delightful."}
{"text":"Although this place is just average, it has a nice ambiance to it.  Dimly lit, slightly crowed, but in an intimate way.

There are simple wooded tables and chairs, with a decent sized bar with seating.

I was only there for 30 minutes but I will remember it as an alright place to grab a few brews.

You gotta try the Dark and Stormy; Ginger beer and rum. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice patio, cool people watching, a strong happy hour and wino Wednesdays where you get a pizza and a bottle of wine for 20 bucks. The waiter even played the \"ugly/hot celebrity you'd totally make out with\" game with us. (He chose Adrian Brody.) Stella, you're aite by me."}
{"text":"Hadn't been since it's changed to Stella!! It was a nice experience. We came early so it was quiet. Our server was friendly & helpful with the new menu. We went with the special for $20 bottle of wine with either pizza or cheese & meat platter. We opted for the platter which had a elegant array of goodies that paired with the wine nicely. We also ordered the artichokes they were delicious but would have been wonderful served with a bit of bread or something to accompany the pesto. We will be back for that great deal!! Thank you"}
{"text":"STELLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  (I mean, come on Yelp friends, you've dropped the ball! No one's made a reference to this famous line yet in any review, and it had to be said at least once!)

This awesome little boîte on the ass end of Bloor has quickly become one of my favorite places. It's casual, unassuming, and serves the best Dark n' Stormy I've tried anywhere. (Though, to be truthful, it's the only Dark n' Stormy I've tried anywhere, but it's still magically, gingery deliciousness!). The owner is friendly and interesting -- not to mention a great bartender! -- and the crowd is pretty chill. Yelp's own Fabio N has spun here a few times, but on the other nights I've visited the music has been a good mix of upbeat tunes from whomever might be manning the decks (or an iPod) that night. Not only are the tunes great, but the volume isn't so loud that you can't have a conversation. Yay, no more coming home after a night out with a hoarse voice from yelling to be heard! 

Did I mention the Dark n' Stormy? It's only $6. Yeah, you're definitely gonna want to try that. And the Whingeing Pomegranate, too -- which is more spendy at $10, but delicious and worth every penny.  I have yet to try the curry, which is supposed to be out of this world, but really I don't come to Stella to eat. I go there to chat with friends, drink delicious drinks, and have a good time. If that's what you're looking for, then Stella definitely delivers."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in for lunch today as I work in the area. I looked online at the lunch menu before going and decided on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich w/fries. While the sandwich was good it was just toooo wet! They put dressing on the top bun, bottom bun and the chopped lettuce also had more dressing. Anytime you picked it up or took a bite everything slid off! Also, because of so much dressing the crispy sandwich was no longer crispy but a soggy mess. I sat at the bar and not once did someone come back and ask if everything was ok. 

Once I got my bill I noticed the price! I had a chicken sandwich and ice tea and it was $19! Once I got back to work I noticed they charged me $15 the dinner price for my sandwich and not $12 for the lunch price. I would have overlooked this if the sandwich and service was great but it just wasn't. 

One thing I noticed too that the moment you walked it it was FREEZING!!! 

I was overall disappointed which stinks because I wanted to like it since I work so close."}
{"text":"I was at Stella tonight to have some curry and a few drinks with friends, but was greeted with the worst service I've experienced in a long long time. 

Not only were they out of several beer options (from their very small list to begin with - the only tap they appeared to have was dry. The ONLY tap was dry!), they were also out of chicken...  (a curry place out of chicken?)

I could have handled all of that - and I did (at first) - even despite the immediate hostility from the server from the moment we walked in (she later complained about being the only server on that night, but the place was not busy in the least, so she was hardly taxed), except that this girl's rudeness was shocking and unstoppable.  For example, a table opened outside so I went to the bar to tell her that we would be moving tables, and when my back was turned she said \"live your life\" - I wasn't sure I was meant to hear that, but when the laughter started I knew I was being mocked. Her volume suggested she didn't care if I heard her or not.

After waiting a really long time for two of my friends to receive their food - easily 30-40 minutes - and after waiting until they were half way through their meals before deciding to find the server to check in on my own meal. She was immediately defensive and her tone was hostile from the start. I had simply asked if she knew how much longer my food was going to be - since I was expecting something like \"any minute, sorry for the wait\", I wasn't too bothered yet, but her response was \"I don't know!\" - as though I was her mother scolding her or something.... the rest of the conversation went downhill from there. I mean, how \"lame\" of me to suggest she check with the kitchen....) and was finally informed that it would be 30 minutes for more rice to be made - and this was after she brought out a plate of food to some other customer, a customer who she said ordered long before me. I have no idea when that person placed their order, but it certainly had not been between the time my friends placed their order and I placed mine, since we all did it together at same the time. Our party of four got out of there as quickly as possible.

I'm not in the habit of blaming servers for failings of the kitchen, but she didn't even try and handle this situation maturely or with any semblance of good, or even ok service. I have learned that this particular server is always surly and rude to customers, and that waiting an hour for food is not uncommon.  Why she is allowed to continue working there, I can't fathom - maybe she's a family member?  But no matter, she's without question a big part of the reason this place was so quiet on a Friday night - in addition to the poorly organized kitchen, no beer, and no food.
I suggest skipping this place - I know I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Just like Central Bistro, this place is WAY TOO LOUD. The 25 people in the bar sound like 150 and we have have to scream to hear each other. Pity cuz the appies we had were decent. There are way too many more audibly reasonable places to choose from to bother returning, despite the fact that we live nearby. Sorry Stella, would rather head to Hillstone where we can have a conversation and not have to scream like we are at a G n R concert."}
{"text":"I liked it. Despite the heat and lack of air conditioning, the fan did keep us cool. Plus, the bartender/owner was so nice and accomodating! He made our huge group feel welcome and even let us bring our dosas from across the street and make a mess of the place. 

Cool cheap decor. Love the old child-style phonographs on the wall, those definitely sparked some memories.

I would like to return when the Bangladeshi chef comes back from his vacation. 

Very relaxed, casual spot with a warm welcome."}
{"text":"Went there for HH after first checking what was offered.   A friend had tipped me off that it is loud.   She wasn't kidding!!   It was very hard to hear.

I perused the HH menu and settled on the Italian manhattan.   Yummm!!  I'd say that was a great drink!    The mix of the different products are perfect.   In fact, I wouldn't mind trying replicating it, which I'm sure would take some time so guess I'll just go to Stella to order.

I had the shoestring fries.    It came to the table fresh from the frier -- piping hot.  There was some kind of dip, which I have no idea what it was, but it was good.   A nice compliment.   It also came with what appeared to be ketchup.   I didn't try it.    I liked the other dip too much.

My friend had the margarita pizza.   Since I was starving, I tried a slice.   Not bad.   Tasted like margarita pizza.

I would go back.  The drinks were reasonably priced, and the place isn't that far from where I live."}
{"text":"Great beer list. 
Delicious Dark and Stormy. 
Great curry for only $10. 
Good music."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, wonderful food, choices for everyone ~ vegetarians included ~ my personal favorites were the happy hour sliders and the french onion soup. And did I mention the wine cellar?? Keep 'em coming Stella, and we'll keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Soooo, I've had nothing but great food and service at this place. The handcrafted cocktails and especially the chicken sandwich are amazing!! The staff is super nice and the ambiance is exceptional!! The only one negative is this Rebecca M came in and started a fight! Who does that in this day and age. And come to find out she applied there and got denied, cause booze was on her breathe. Anyhow, great place for happy hour and families. I'm sure they will do well and flourish! Bad on you Rebecca M!!! And by the way the peach cobbler is the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"This one is definitely worth a visit.  Other than the bar being too loud due to the live band it's a great little place.  The appatisers didn't seem appealing.  A sad trend overall with new restaurants in Phoenix.  The caprese salad was excellent, beautifully plated, fresh and delicious.  I had the short rib served with a goat cheese and truffle oil infused mac and cheese which was sinful as well as steamed broccolini.  Everything on the plate was perfect.  The portions were generous...especially as far as the short rib.  I have been rooting for a restaurant to take this space and remain for the long haul...and Stella might just be a perfect fit.  I would have already returned...but didn't want to entertain guests in a place that would be a little too loud on a weekend.  We will return...and would recommend others to try it as well."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and is the only reason I'll give this place the rating I did. The music that was playing was great! The service was absolutely terrible. We were not only forgotten about, but we had to go find the bartender to help us. As nice as the bartender was, the fact that she was as new as she was and behind the bar is disturbing. You should not be behind the bar if you can't make a regular mojito. You guys should look into getting someone with experience to support the newbie. It took a good 15 - 20 min for someone to realize that half our group hadn't gotten the chance to order drinks. The only reason I did a 3 star and not a 2 is because they took off the drinks that either took too long or were made poorly."}
{"text":"Looks can often be misleading. 

I would often walk past Cafe Stella, see through the dark windows and think how uninviting it looked. To me, it seemed like a divey bar, unsure at how the food tasted or if it was comfortable for me to hang out. My opinion changed when I came here to see my friend's art show. He counts this place as his local and after coming here a few times, I can see why he likes it.

Café Stella may not look like a top restaurant with the most up-to-date décor but it has the potential to be. It definitely falls under the category of gemstone in the rough because it has great points to back up my statement: it has a relaxed and casual atmosphere; the food is very good; and you'll probably get the best customer service in the city. 

The café's owner, Ronti (unsure of the spelling) is a people-person and will offer the best service he can give you. Like many small restaurants, he's the lone chef and has a person helping him out in the evenings. Otherwise, it's just him, his restaurant and the eagerness to serve you his delicious food. 

If I had to pin-point the food to an ethnicity, I'd say it's Middle Eastern-inspired. There are a lot of vegetarian dishes with fresh vegetables and legumes like a chickpea salad that has loads of cucumbers, carrots, and garlic. He also makes a curried lentils and onions dish served with warm pita bread. There are also meat dishes though I can't remember how he prepared them. But really, that doesn't matter: it's all delicious. I will warn you that if you're there for an event, the food will disappear as soon as the platter touches the table, so skedaddle and fill up your plate. 

Since my introduction, I've been back here a few times and it has grown on me. It's a casual place to grab a meal or to enjoy a beer with friends instead of your typical pub. 

Thanks to the locals who love Café Stella and to Ronti who is open to ideas, a lot of fun events have been organized. They've hosted photo exhibits; trivia nights (one of them was a music trivia where my team kicked ass and won first prize - booya!!); dj nights; and dance party nights. 

All of these were fun and I've invited friends to each of them, in turn spreading the love for one of my new favourite locals."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch twice in less than two weeks. What a great menu for lunch. Today many of us in our party of 9 had the Steak Au Poivre which was excellent. The brandy cream sauce was very light and the steak was cooked to perfection. The Caesar salad was delicious with the light traditional dressing. One of the lunch specials last week was Caesar salad with blackened shrimp that was mouth watering delicious! My only complaint is that the wait time for the food may be a little longer than average, but overall this is a great restaurant re-do. I was also a fan of Central Bistro. Tom was our waiter both times and he's very good at his job and keeping his customers happy and satisfied. Great selection in the background music; totally fits in with the ambiance. Looking forward to trying happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food! The service was very, very slow. Our server worked hard for us while the Manager didn't do much to contribute, she often stood at the hostess desk. They have live music during the week, great music but it is way too loud, where you couldn't even hear each other. We asked to turn the music down and the server was not able to do that, she too complained about the decibel level. So if your wanting good food and ambiance, I'd recommend not sitting in the bar because the music is deafening."}
{"text":"Stellar.  A new favorite.

Arguably the best hipster music bar in town.   Hand selected... curated content.   Turntables if you need them.  

What was once a derelict hangout has become the perfect place to grab a drink while forgetting the cold world outside.

Everything's been revamped.   From the beautiful new bar top to the  suddenly-awesome selection of beer and perfectly priced single malt scotch.   

A place where you wouldn't be caught dead is now date-night worthy.

Street cred meets sophistication.

The city is alive.   

The rotting flesh of burnt-out crackheads has given way to the sweet smell of urban gentrification.    

Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"STELLA!!!!!

Why I have not been here for brunch sooner?!?!  I came for Sunday brunch and I'm telling you I will 100% be back.  We sat on the bar side of the restaurant, and I would highly recommend sitting over there if you can.  On Sunday mornings, they have a musician playing acoustical cover songs right near the bar, and the guy who was there when we were absolutely rocked!  His arrangements were so interesting, and the sound was loud enough for you to enjoy it, but not so loud that you couldn't hear each other speak.  Really great way to set a Sunday morning mood.

And the food was also really spot on!!  The star that we ordered was the Hash, which comes with short ribs, a buttermilk biscuit, and an egg as you like it.  Holy moly, was this dish everything!!  The meat was silky and flavorful, the hash was stock full of potatoes, peppers and onions and it was topped off with an amazing sauce.  We talked about how delicious this meat would be in a taco, so perhaps they can make that happen sometime ;)

I had to dock 1 star because our waiter was hard to find at times, but it turns out that was because he was the only waiter for the morning, so that's understandable.  The bartender and host/manager had to cover here and there so that helped.

I definitely recommend checking this place out for brunch sometime!!"}
{"text":"Stop serving your reds COLD!!! At least tell your customers when they order. It was a kick to my face when my Malbec had a totally different taste to it. We were there with no plan but maybe a few glasses and perhaps after feeling the vibe, enjoy a nice dinner. But NO!! The vibe is just not there and it is very superficial. Just BAD. Nothing special about this place at all. We had one glass, paid and left to a different place. Never to come back to this again. Ever."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at my first experience. (I was hoping it was similar to central bistro). Our artichoke appetizer tasted like jared artichokes. Had two different servers who were unfriendly and very short. I had asked if my pasta could be made with truffle oil and the male server said \"yes\", brings it out (tasting nothing like truffle oil) then the female server returns and says they do not even carry that. Spaghetti (the most simple dish) tasted like concentrated tomato paste. The female server was kind enough to take the appetizer off our bill however the whole whole experience was underwhelming."}
{"text":"We went to brunch at Stella last Sunday. The atmosphere was fun, bright, and casual with live music playing. Friendly Mark, the owner, greeted us himself, showed us to our table and checked on us often, even though we had a great waitress, too! We had biscuits and gravy and the bacon and egg croissant sandwich, delish!  Extra nice fruit salad was our side. Be sure to get a photo of yourself against the wall out the north exit, the wall is painted to look like a postcard from Stella and you are the picture part of it, how fun!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stella got off to a slow start, but after visiting a couple of more times I feel like it's picked up.  Sandwiches at lunch are great, and a nice
Place to have dinner.  This place should be more busy."}
{"text":"This shopping center seems to struggle to keep restaurants around. My family has been wanting to try Stella since it opened (reopened? Not sure what exactly happened with Central Bistro, which I really liked) and we didn't make it in until this weekend. The decor and vibe is very similar. It feels like it wants to be trendy.. but we went in for dinner around 6:30 on Saturday and were shocked to see hardly anyone there. Maybe two other tables and a few people at the bar. The lack of patrons made our appearance pretty obvious and we were sat and greeted by a waiter quickly. I felt the food menu was limited but what I did end up ordering I loved! I really felt like the taste and quality of the food was top notch. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. The service declined throughout the night though - the place eventually started to fill in and we had a difficult time getting our server's attention. A food runner brought out the meal and a busser took away the dishes and we didn't see them until we really wanted the check. Not sure what was going on. Was it just an off night? Are we boring people who went to dinner too early? Was there some sort of bad omen we didn't know about? I think we'd go back and give it another shot, it just didn't wow anyone."}
{"text":"First visit was with family and friends for brunch Sunday 11/6/16.  Modern and upscale decor but still very casual and comfortable. Nice collection of wines and beers and great house takes on cocktails.  Chicken fried chicken,waffles,gravlax and steak and eggs were all big hits.  The monkey bread kept the grandsons and Uncle Eli quiet and happy.  Very friendly and attentive waitstaff.  Open window walls on a beautiful day made it seem like we were outside but comfortably in the shade. Looking forward to dinner on our next visit."}
{"text":"Is there a stronger word for amazing? Whatever that word is... that's the word I pick for this restaurant. We started with the calamari. Delicious. We also chose the salmon entree and the steak. It was some of the best salmon I have tasted in the valley. Service was impeccable and the ambiance on a Friday night was energetic. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Nice place, recently opened.  Unfortunately the menu is not all available. No appetizers or entree.
We had a salad and a pasta, both delicious .  Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening last night for Stella. My husband and I are we're nervous hoping the new ownership didn't mess with the decor too much but did work on the menu, making it less pretentious and more simplified good cooking - we were blown away. Definitely get the Charcuterie Board & the Truffle Mac and cheese that comes with the short ribs is phenomenal! So happy to have this little gem in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was on lunch break and in the shopping center when a friend pointed out she loves the salads here. I had no idea what this place was although i pass by it several times a week. I liked the inside and the patio I can tell it must be crowded at night. I saw they will be having live music too. My salad of course was yum and I will be stopping on my home from work more often"}
{"text":"Wow!  I came here for brunch yesterday with a group of friends, and it was the best brunch I've had in a while.  First of all, I am a fan of anywhere that offers bottomless mimosas, especially when they're heavy on the bubbly, as these were.  I hate when it's basically a big carafe of OJ with a splash of champagne--definitely not the case here.  I ordered the chicken fried chicken.  I am from Mississippi, so I am always skeptical of fried chicken.  Theirs was perfect--crispy skin, perfectly cooked chicken.  I subbed the asiago bacon grits for the potatoes, and that was a fantastic choice.  They were flavorful and rich.  I also tried my friend's burger--delicious, as were the fries.  Finally, we ordered the peach cobbler for the table.  It came in a cast iron skillet and was served a la mode.  I'm usually not much of a cobbler fanatic, but this was different.  The breeding was moist and sweet, and I couldn't get enough!  Oh, and they also had live music for Sunday brunch!  I am so thrilled to have Stella in my neighborhood!  I will be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"This place took a while to grow on me but now it's a go-to. It's a reliable hole in the wall with friendly and kind staff. The patio is great for people watching. They are pretty much one of the only places in Bloordale open for late night noshing. I wish they served more than just curry but it definitely hits the spot.   

Stella is kind of my neighbourhood Cheers and I'm glad I gave it a chance!"}
{"text":"I was in the restaurant when the owner went crazy the other night. As in Shary B's review below. Her story is totally accurate. It was a really disturbing experience. We just moved into the neighborhood and wanted to give this place a try. Instead, we ended up leaving half way through our drinks when the owner/chef started verbally abusing the server and other customers. No way I would ever set foot in there again."}
{"text":"I've come to frequent this spot in recent weeks. Close to Lansdowne subway stop, it's a good spot to meet friends who will venture west (to the 'ass end of nowhere' as Eric M notes) to meet up near me.

I say it's well worth the trip for the Dark and Stormy alone, but they also offer a variety of beers and some delicious smelling curry that I have yet to try. 

They've got open-mike nights, and DJs on the weekend, but my favourite evenings are the quieter ones where Vince will play you his faves or you can bring your own!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Great atmosphere! Happy hour every day 3-6. Live music Wednesday's and Thursday's during the week. Brunch on Sundays at 9 with bottomless mimosas and bloody's. Heaven!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. The owner was super friendly and served our drinks quickly considering he was the only one there.

Cheap decor and furniture, the usual hipster-ish kind of set up I'm seeing a lot of lately.

Great booze selection and love the large menu clearly indicating what you can order and how much it costs. (Some  bars fail miserably at this). I liked the sound of the \"whineing pomegranate\" drink, although I wasn't up for trying it at 7pm on a Tuesday night. Maybe next time!

Hope the chef gets back from vacation soon so I can return to sample some food."}
{"text":"That didn't last long...We had went several times...Got a little weird the last two times...Always sad when a local place can't make it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I really like this place. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's a little light to be a *destination* bar. It's a fantastic little neighborhood bar, and I think it would be best for it to stay that way.

I keep coming back to this place, and even when there is a substantial period of time between visits, the owner/operator always remembers us, and treats us well. The butter chicken is great, and very inexpensive. For that matter, prices are very reasonable all around. And some of the best cocktails in the city. No joke. I have had Dark 'N Stormys all over North America and the Caribbean, and these guys get it right. My undergrad dorm was full of Bermies who would bring Goslings by the case back to school to show us how it was properly done, so I know of which I speak. And the \"Whinging Pomegranate\" is worth trying at least once; with double alcohol and substantial preparation, $10 is exceptionally reasonable.

The music selection is eclectic, and awesome, even when it's not to my taste. Every time I think the music sucks, it also makes me laugh, whatever it is. Some nights have DJs, and others are just prerecorded mixes. It's small, intimate, and comfortable. There is definitely a hipster vibe, but not so much so as to be pretentious. In fact, it's just the perfect place to hang out with friends and talk when there is no DJ, and a great place to party when there is; two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"We were fortunate enough to be invited to the pre open dinner. Our server was fantastic, made good suggestions and very attentive. The food was very good, shrimp and grits, filet and short ribs and a strawberry shortcake to finish it off. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken in town! While the menu selection might be small, it's a great place to go to if you're craving some delicious curry, or just a place to relax and have some drinks. The owner/head cook is great -- super friendly."}
{"text":"Came here one night to listen to Fabio blast out some good tunes. But didn't stay too long.

On my follow-up visit with some friends we had a good time. The place was packed on a Saturday night and unfortunately they were short staffed. The bartender though was in good spirits and made the best of the situation.

Like any good hipster bar they have tallboys of Steigel. Mmm, mmm good.

Try the dark and stormy."}
{"text":"CMYE: Bloordale Bar Crawl #1

Drink: Sleeman's Light

Cafe with no food?? OK Cafe Stella is a drinking place only until the Chef return from his vacation?? 

Surprising only 1 draft available.. nothing against Steam Whistle... but hey I am not visiting Steam Whistle Brewery today..

They do have great selections of bottle/can beers. I had the Sleeman Light secretly hoping it is really light in calories because I don't want a beer belly yet!

Furnitures remained me of tables and chairs when I was still in elementary/high school... secretly wishing it wasn't that long ago. I wish I can have some more comfy chairs to lounge around...."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a cold night and had an amazing time! It was pretty quiet so we sat at the bar with the wonderful Brianna, who was equally talented and sweet. It was my friend's birthday and she really went out of her to make it a great night. Her a hot toddy was one of the best things I've enjoyed in Bloordale in ages; her attention to detail was second to none. I just wish I'd taken a picture of it! In fact, we had gone in with the intention of just having a drink but ended up staying for hours because of the great service and killer drinks.

The bar also smelled phenomenal; the cooks were making a curry. We will be going back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great vibe..usually have the butter chicken and Hawaii beer to wash it down which never disappoints...on the negative cash only with no atm and limited menu which is a shame as their chef is fantastic"}
{"text":"Nice little space with authentic dishes (curry inspired) to warm the palate on a cold winter day. Good assortment of beers on tap to pair with the dishes.  Dark & Stormy and Whisky Sour...both nice options.  Cozy and friendly no fuss atmosphere that delivers a wonderful plate.  If curry's your thing...this is most defiantly the place."}
{"text":"Stella won my heart about a year ago when they first reopened. It's such a chill atmosphere where you can go for a drink with some friends and have a wonderful time. Their events such as open mic night, spin your own and Lansdowne high fi are always fun. They have a great selection if beer and mix drinks and best if all a wicked menu of delicious curries and appetizers at are well priced and a portion that leaves you satisfied but not over the top where u feel u need to hit the ER on your way home. The fish curry especially is just perfection with a smooth meaty fish that is just spicy enough to leave behind the memory of that last coveted bite. I caution you to take a lot of yourself control with you otherwise you will end up in a curry coma...a well worth it curry coma! Makes me want to run down the street with a white tank screaming STELLAAAA!!!! My only complaint is that they don't accept debit BUT I'll gladly take the trip to the bank"}
{"text":"*EDIT* Bartender/manager Vince has been driven out.  It will never be the same.  I don't expect to be back to this place.  Such a shame.  Great while it lasted..."}
{"text":"This was a first date experience for me, and I was not overwhelmed by this business.  We had a reservation and was told the owner decided to shut the place down early due to lack of business... Nice way to start your meal! 
The food was OK. The brie was deep fried or breaded in such a way the cheese was hard in the middle. They served it with dried toast and grapes. Not at all what I was expecting.
I had the margarita pizza which tasted very salty to me?  
The service was good except for the waiter putting away the patio furniture while we were still dining. 
Not impressed enough to try it again."}
{"text":"Only had drinks but Lexi the bartender made it a really great experience! Will definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Came for a soft brunch opening. Food, atmosphere and staff were all great. We had the steak, Asiago grits n eggs and the chicken fried chicken with sausage gravy. Both were excellent and the steak was cooked perfectly. Great job guys. Keep up the great work. Will be back and try some other items."}
{"text":"First time checking out this place ..... new name same decor!!! .... very very quiet on a Saturday nite.... service was friendly but the food was well below average .... the tomato sauce used for the meatballs, the lasagna and the bolognese was very bland and I would guess came straight out of a can... way too much sugar too!! (Which really is unnecessary)

When we got the bill they had overcharged the wine.... only by 2$ per glass but sometimes its a principle more than anything !!! When I made them aware they chose to do nothing about it ....

Love the location and love the setting but we will definitely not go back till someone new takes over (and that will happen soon imho)"}
