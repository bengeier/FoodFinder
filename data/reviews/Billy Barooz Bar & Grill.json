{"text":"We were excited to go here for the first time, we went to watch the Bears/Packers game.  Greeters were friendly and dressed in bears jerseys, so we thought, \"this is gonna be great\".  They asked where we preferred to sit and we said we'd like a table with a great view of the Bears game... since it was before kickoff, there were many tables available.  We had a great view of two big vs, so we ordered some beers and appetizers. We got the nachos and 20 BBQ wings.  As we waited for our food, we noticed that the game had started and was playing on only one of the 6 TV's in our section.  I asked our waitress if she could put the game on the two monitors that we had right in front of us.  She informed us that she couldn't and that whatever game was playing on the TV's had to stay there, no switching.  We looked at each other in disbelief and looked around the room to see which tv the game was on, it was on only ONE TV, and it was behind us on a wall at a angled viewing so the image was somewhat distorted.  This sucked!  Our food came out and I asked the server that brought our food if indeed they wouldn't change the channels so we could see the game in our TV's.  At least she went to the bartender, who was the supposed \"ruler of the remotes\", and asked for us.  Once again, nope, they stayed where they were.  We got up and moved all our stuff around to position ourselves to see the weird angled TV.  I thought I read that billy baroos was supposed to be a great place for watching the game.  Our waitress never offered any accommodation, like if she could seat us at a closer table.  We were very unhappy at this point.  I just wanted to leave, but we had all this food.  No one was watching the two TV's close to us, no one!  Another couple in Bears jerseys sat near us and asked why the Bears game wasn't on either TV, we told them the story and they didn't even stick around to order drinks.  Lucky them!  So now a party of 8 comes in and pulls a couple tables together next to us, not looking like football fans and had 3 small children with them.  They ask their waitress, who wasn't the same as ours, if they could see the Bears game in the TV closest to us.  A few minutes later, there it was, the Bears game. Are you kidding me?  They weren't even paying attention to the game. At this point I asked for the check, I hated the fact that we were still in billy baroos!  Our food probably tasted good, but the mood this place put me in made it taste terrible!  I was really hoping to like this place, as we are looking for a new place to watch the games, but this place failed BAD!  There are so many other options for places around here.  I cringe at the thought of billy baroos now.  Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Had no idea it was there- an associate took me for lunch.  Decent menu, good service and while the prices seemed a bit high, the food servings were very healthy.  Frankly nothing memorable, either good or bad."}
{"text":"I come here often and order a variety of things.  The food is good and they have a decent variety of beers and such but I'm not sure everything is always fresh.  They have a great staff and a whole bunch of tv's to catch the games.  If you have a big group this is a great place to come and everything is a reasonable price.  Like I said, I just feel things can be a lot more fresh."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food and service at this spot.
Since I began visiting the place a couple years ago I have never had a bad experience.
I highly recommend it if you like great tasting food, good portions and good prices.
Always clean and has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a very unpleasant experience here for breakfast!  I usually order steak n' eggs no matter where I go for breakfast.  Since the closing of Uncle Jacks, Billy Barooz is offering breakfast.  The only thing keeping this from a 1 star was the manager!  

I spoke to the general manager, Brian, and explained how unsatisfied I was.  He was very concerned and apologetic.  If I choose to give them another chance, the next meal will be on the house.  In addition, I have ate here for lunch/dinner.  They have really good pub grub/bar food, but...THE BREAKFAST IS HORRIBLE.   For $12.99 I expect a decent size steak n' eggs.  The one being served here is paper thin!  Save yourself some money and order the steak n' eggs at Taffies, or Mary Ann's.  You will get the same paper thin steak, but at half the costs."}
{"text":"We came to see if the restaurant would work for my mother-in-law's 90th birthday party. Even though it was starting to get busy (lunch on St Paddy's day) the owner (Carlos Nieto) took time to show us the space available. Sadly, it wasn't laid out in a way that allowed what we wanted. But Carlos went above and beyond by calling another restaurant for us. He arranged for us to meet the event planner. We stayed at Billy Barooz for lunch. It was delicious. Thanks, Carlos!"}
{"text":"I am not one to complain because I have worked in the industry and there are always so many factors in play at any given time. However, I was pleased with the food the first 3 times I ate here but the last 3 times within the last 6-8 months it has been a huge let down. Luke warm all 3 times, very salty the last time (and I've had a friend do an intervention on me for eating too much salt), and really dry meat the time before that. Today may be it for me. It is very disappointing to get \"House brined \"Corned Beef\" Brisket with no added nitrates\" (their description on Facebook, quotes around corned beef and all, that I saw later on when checking to see if anyone else was disappointed...and someone else was) when you are craving corned beef. Would have been nice to have been warned when placing the $30 order that it's not the expected dish. And even knowing the description, it was tough, gray, and tasteless. Where was the salt in this dish known to be salty? The nitrates give it the nice pink color and arguably more flavor if you brine it long enough for them to turn into nitrites...And the roasted potatoes? Don't get me started...If those were roasted they were roasted for days, otherwise I'd guess they were warmed up in a fryer or microwaved or something else that made them very unappealing. The cabbage was cabbage at least. I gave it one star because of the first experiences and the fact that I got a full albeit unimpressed stomach. Although I could have gotten that at McDonalds for $2."}
{"text":"Only acceptable when completely empty. If you go here when busy, you will just watch aggressive people who have been there ten seconds power past you to steal a table. When you finally get one, the waitstaff will suddenly take an interest and tell you someone else has already claimed this table. 

ABSOLUTELY AVOID"}
{"text":"An excellent Guinness pour (the \"Black and Blue\" is divine) and the Billy Beef with sweet potato fries will make a believer out of the most hardened cynic. It's not \"cool,\" but who cares? There are no hipsters here. LOL"}
{"text":"One of our in town favorites. Love to go especially in the summer and sit outside. Jerk chicken sandwich is the best! Potato skin appetizer is good too!"}
{"text":"Used to go here once month or so.  The food and service were always consistently okay (but just okay).  The last time we went there weren't enough small tables and the waitress tried to get us to wait at the door even though there were three larger tables and seats at the bar available.  Figure out your seating issues and train your servers in customer service in the mean time.  Plenty of other places to eat."}
{"text":"A favorite for local sports fans and the after-work crowd, though the whole-team crews often go to Jupiter's next door based on seating capacity.  We primarily go there for after-work drinks and snacks though I have eaten there on occasion.  Except during games and playoffs it's a civilized and reasonable place for such things.

Edit (12/15/14):  They fixed the menu!  Whoever took over in the kitchen knows exactly what they're doing and everything we've tried is great!  Added two stars and deleted old gripes."}
{"text":"Food was great service was awesome Roxy doesn't great job the only thing I found annoying was the guy behind the bar listening to music off of cell phone same little high hat beat over and over and over and over I was going to say something but didn't I have a no phone at work policy in my kitchen just for that reason just thought I'd share"}
{"text":"This place is a sports bar that supposedly caters to customers. Wrong!  We asked several times to have one of the tv turned to the Bears packers game because that's the whole reason we went there. They only had the game on one TV in our room and a small TV over the bar that wasn't visible from our table. What a waste of a Sunday afternoon. They eventually put the Bears game on another monitor, but by that time it was too late, they already pissed us off. The food was good and came out in a reasonable amount of time, but we went for the game.  I doubt we'll go back. Buffalo Wild Wings treats us way better than this place did, even Jupiters is better.  If you only want to eat, then this place is adequate, but if you wanna watch sports, avoid this one and go to BWW or Jupiters. Heck, papa dels is right across the street and their pizza is awesome and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"If you are coming here for the food, get drunk first.  \"JUST\" is the word of the day....JUST ok, just warm, just...wait a minute, it is 6pm and you ran out of avocados but still sell the avacado salad??  WTF? Get your butt in gear and drive 6 blocks to county market and buy some avocados!!!   Ribeye sandwich....it was bits and strips of meat....never order again, check!  Sweet potato fries, good, fish tacos, good.... but getting drunk will make the food tasty :-) :-)  Not a fan of this place but off you want to drink and watch sports it may be the best place in town...."}
{"text":"I went here with a big group early on a Friday night. We had to sit at two separate round tables, so that was a little awkward. The service was very good though, but I think my expectations were too high. It seemed like everybody was talking about it and the food was just fine, nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"Love the lobster salad croissant. Always a great place either before or after Illinois games."}
{"text":"We recently moved here and were told we must try this place. The first couple of times we went was great. Service and food has always been good. The brisket nachos are definitely my favorite. 

The last time we visited however was not the same. We stood at the front door waiting to be seated for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile serveral servers walked by and I made eye contact with at least one bartender. As the host was casually walking up this was the conversation:
Host: Two? (no real greet and it was COMPLETELY obvious she could care less)
Guest: Yes 
Host: Booth, table or high top? (While we appreciated being offered the choice it was said with a tone of no real care, which we didn't appreciate)
Guest: Booth please
*Host begins to walk away towards a booth in the corner. Casually tosses the menus on the table and (with the same \"I don't care\" tone) said \"Enjoy\". Well we weren't sure who she was talking to us or the air behind her because we hadn't even made it to the table yet. 
As the server approaches (with the similar attitude) and her greet was \"can I get you something to drink?\" My husband asks if there are any drink specials and the answer was \"No\". So we just get 2 waters. At this point we weren't feeling very welcome so we just did 2 waters, ordered dinner (which was eh), ate and left. 

Now, being in the hospitality industry myself and managing restaurants this is a far far cry from any good hospitality to make a guest want to come back. There are things that service can make up for. If we had been nicely greeted from the get go and had our waitress made us feel more welcome we may not remember that our food was just eh. The pasta dish was flavorless and the steak sandwich was about the same. He dipped it in ranch to give it at least some flavor. 

We live just down the street but from now on will probably head downtown for better service and food."}
{"text":"Went here last night, and ordered the Cajun Creole Pasta as I have many times before, for the first time ever I sent it back, it was WAY too salty! Sent it back for a new one, I got another in about 2 minutes, was told it was made fresh, must have been ready for someone else, this too was way too salty, had my wife try it who likes a lot more salt on her food than I do, and she thought it was way too salty. So I decided to order something else, the prime rib philly, of course they were out of that! So I decided to go with a steak sandwich, the flavor was good, but it had a lot of gristle. When the check came I asked if I could get a discount since my experience was so bad. The waitress talked to the manager and he gave me a whole $6 off of my sandwich oh boy! After my wife and I had to watch each other eat separately, the bad pasta, the gristle in the steak sandwich, I would think they could have done a little more. The manager couldn't even be bothered to come over to my table and apologize or even talk to me about my experience. After coming here for many years, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for some lunch and to watch the Bears. Was pleasantly surprised with my experiencing considering some of the reviews!

We sat at the bar. It took awhile for the bartender to come by and take our drink orders. From then on though we received prompt service (food orders, refills, removal of plates, etc...).

I ordered the ribeye steak sandwich. It was delicious! Great grill marks, tender meat, and flavorful! The side of au jus was a nice touch. The sweet potato fries were crispy with a hint of cinnamon sugar. My husband had the pork loin sandwich with buffalo sauce and enjoyed his meal, too.

Overall, we had a good experience at Billy Barooz and will likely go back in the future."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to eat at but my fiance loves their Billy Beef sandwich. The food isn't the best in my opinion and I've had quite a bit of their menu items. 

The wait staff is usually really friendly but the last time we went and got a high booth our waitress was rude and hardly around. She was one of the older waitresses. She just didn't seem to care about waiting on us and as soon as she dropped something off she was gone. I wanted extra napkins because some of their sandwiches and burgers can be very messy but she had her back to us as fast as she dropped our food off. My fiance and I split the bill this time and had to hail down our waitress because as soon as we said we wanted our check she once again already had her back to us going in the other direction. She never asked us how things were or if we needed anything else.

On top of that right before she took our order she told the hostess that my fiance was a jacka$$ (sorry I really don't want to use profanity). You guys were getting busy so he dropped me off to get a parking spot. I already got the booth in the back and he knew where I was so he just walked in and came straight to the table and didn't notice that the hostess had tried to say anything to him. So when she came to get his drink order she was giving him a nasty look.

We'll still probably come here every once and a while since he enjoys it so much but we'll probably request a different waitress."}
{"text":"Mr. Husband and I don't live too very far from Billy Barooz, and it's a great place for us to go after work when we don't want to cook or have Chinese or pizza. The food is solid. I love the California burger done medium rare - nice and juicy, and who doesn't love avocado? Their fries are pretty good, too. The prices are what I expect. Sometimes it's crowded, and the beer selection is pretty standard, and you have to seat yourself, and sometimes the servers aren't terribly attentive, but other times they will entertain babies or bring extra napkins and drink refills without being asked or charm your parents who are from out of town. I've had great experiences here, and mediocre ones, but I'm glad Billy Barooz exists.

A practical note: If you have a group of four people or more, get the nachos as an appetizer. Three or fewer, just order the nachos with chicken or steak as a meal and split it. They're that large. Also, I am in love with the jalapenos on the nachos. Mmm."}
{"text":"Creative Menu, Consistent Good Service and the place to be seen Friday's for lunch. We love supporting local businesses. The patio is must during good weather. And the bar a great place to watch the game and enjoy a beer."}
{"text":"Love Billy Barooz!  Really great family-friendly bar and grill! Even when it's loud and crowded, the wait staff is very attentive and friendly! It's a permanent staple for us! And did I mention the ice cold beer?! Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great.  Food is good and atmosphere is great.  The steaks are good but not the best in town. The cheesy broccoli is amazing however."}
{"text":"The food here was great. Went during the very busy Kentucky Derby with a large party and the waitstaff had no problem keeping up. The lobster dip was one of the best appetizers I have ever had. Burgers where big and tasty. I ordered the crab cakes (app menu) along with soup and it was just enough food. Great visit and will make sure to stop when back in Champaign."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The atmosphere was kind of college - sportsy. It was clean and comfortable. Our server was friendly and the food was delicious and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I went here for the ILLINI NIT game with a friend and thought the atmosphere was great for watching sporting events.  The service was great at first with our waitress being attentive and checking up on us a couple of times.  The food was fairly priced and she liked her chocked burger while I found my ham and cheese to be a bit underwhelming.  I never thought I'd say a sandwich had too much meat but this one did and it drowned out the other flavors.  

Service took a severe nose dive midway through the second quarter of the game.  We both wanted refills on our drinks but our waitress walked by our table several times from that point on without asking us if we'd like refills on our empty cups.  At first we were willing to give her the benefit of the doubt because the place was busy but by the end of the third quarter we actually got nasty looks from wait staff as if they wanted us to leave.  If understand if there was a line of people waiting for a seat but while it was busy, there was no line that I was aware of.  During a game you'd think the staff would understand that people would want to watch the game in its entirety (especially a close contest), but we got the impression they wanted us out.  Too bad because we were talking about getting a dessert."}
{"text":"This place was a rare treat. How often do you go somewhere where everything tastes good!? --- and then on top of that the service was great!! My friend had the ribs with a side of broccoli and mashed potatoes- real mashed potatoes and fresh broccoli (and huge portions)-. The ribs actually had (good) meat on them. I had the patty melt with sweet potato fries and a side of ranch-- everything was seasoned and cooked so good! Definitely going back  So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Best steak sandwich in champaign! Actually great food all together! I love the fact they added on to the inside and their outside! I have no real complaints about this place except the staff could be a little better!"}
{"text":"Took over thirty minutes to get my salad and appetizer. The Cajun stuffed shrimp is amazing though. Great food just very poor service."}
{"text":"My favorite go to resturant! Everything   on the menu is so good. Never disappointed . Great staff. Amy R.  Is the Best Waitress  ever!!"}
{"text":"We were in on Sunday to watch the Seahawks game (in IL?  Yes, I know.  And the hubby's not even FROM Seattle, he's a Jersey boy.  Go figure).  Our waitress, Lauren, made sure to keep checking in that the right game was on for us, and noticed right away that it hadn't switched over when it was supposed to.  Most servers would wait for their customers to complain or ask for help, so I really loved that she was keeping tabs on us to make sure we got what we needed. 

Odd nachos, but I think that's just a matter of personal taste.  The beer selection was pretty standard.  For a football Sunday, the place was actually pretty empty.  We thought we'd gotten lucky snagging ourselves a table, but the entire time we were in(~3-6pm) there were less than four groups in the place.  Do people not go to bars to watch the game in C-U?

Anyway, 3 stars for the food and beverages, 5 for the service, 4 for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great deals, decent food, and all the sports you can handle.  I've never had a bad meal here and the waitstaff has always been attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best steak sandwich in town. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Billy's is the best place to go if you want to watch a game and have a drink in Champaign.  Their new remodel looks awesome (haven't sat in there yet).  My personal favorites are Chili Con Queso Appetizer, Black Bean Fajita Burger, Cajun Chicken Pasta or Mexican Salad with Steak.  

There isn't another place in town with solid food and this many TV's.  If they made the Buffalo Chicken Wrap on the permanent menu my life would be a lot better!  Wine selection needs to be improved to get 5 stars from me.  Overall good place with consistently good service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after the movie.  Good service and the tuna was excellent! Unexpected to have such good fish at a sports bar!"}
{"text":"An all round great restaurant.  The food is good, lots of choices, not terribly pricey. Drinks are generously poured and they are the only place I know that carries Blanton's bourbon.   The service is good.  When the place is full, it's noisy, but not in a bad way.  Most recently had butterfly shrimp app, with sriracha mayo.  Also, pork backribs with fresh grilled asparagus. Plenty of meat on tender ribs, and well seasoned asparagus perfectly cooked.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for a late lunch.  Sat for 15 minutes without anyone acknowledging our presence.  Flagged down a bus boy during this time who said he would get our waitress.  Nothing.  Stopped at the bar on the way out and told whoever was there what happened and that we were leaving.  Her response?  It's not my table.  

Never again.

We went to Prairie Fire and had a delightful lunch."}
{"text":"Ok- let's face it-
There are very few fine dining places to eat on the west side of Champaign. 

Billy's at least offers a fun, casual and varied menu- that you don't mind making it a favorite.

Pro: assorted menu; decent prices, great hours, wonderful hostesses, great bartenders, love the patio. Great allergy menu options. Side parking and entrance.

Con: food delivery is inconsistent- (stop screwing with the fabulous new quinoa and kale salad!! I get it to-go A LOT!! One day I may just go Chef Ramsey on you! Is anyone weighing salads in the back?? Stop it! Give me my $12 worth!)

Waitresses- I feel for you. It's a hard job. But just try to smile every now and then- and come back and check on us or complain you have too many tables and it's overwhelming.... ask for help. Somethings gotta give- since expansion, table service has been on the decline. And yes, it's crazy busy in there. I'm no dining room manager, so if you're overworked, again, I feel for you!! 

I would give it a 3 1/2, but I can't- but more than not- it's on the 4 side- stop messing with my salad and give the waitresses more help and my next review might just be a 5! Rock on Billy!!"}
{"text":"I went to Billy's this evening to watch the Seahawks game. There were so many tvs that it didn't bother anybody to switch one to the hawks.

Service was good. Food was great. And the prices reflected that."}
{"text":"Eh- I can take this place or leave it.  I like the lunch and apps., but the breakfast is horrible.  Since Uncle Jack's closed down, Billy Barooz is now offering breakfast.  Unfortunately, it's no where the same level of food quality as Uncle Jack's.  

I ordered the Eggs Benedict (Which I love everywhere else) and hated it here.  The English muffin was semi- thawed and mushy and instead of the eggs being slightly runny, they were completely hard- boiled. So gross.  I will not be back here for breakfast.  :("}
{"text":"Went here after having a bad experience at a nearby restaurant called Wedge. The waitress here was great! I had the gourmet grilled cheese with bacon - friggin awesome! My wife got a pasta dish and though I'm not sure what it was called it is a new favorite of mine. 

Thanks Billy Barooz for a nice dinning experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had hands down! The perfect thickness and the bun was over the top good. REAL cherry soda! Awesome wait staff, they take care of you here! Drinks prepared excellent and price is good too! 

My friend will travel over an hour to have the grilled chicken salad too! Then-sweet potato fries oh my! I don't even like sweet potato fries usually but these are magical :) 

Bring friends and go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hamburgers were fantastic!  Service was a little slow, but well worth the wait.  The chip-dips are amazing- highly recommend.  Aaron the store manager was very friendly.  I will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat, love the whole menu. Service is great. Lots of tv's. Great sports bar"}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time at about 6pm on Saturday evening. 

Three of us were seated right away by the friendly host and our waitress was very friendly and prompt. 

We didn't waste anytime ordering and our drinks and appetizer came out super fast. 

I highly recommend the spinach & lobster dip, as well as the salmon burger. Delicious! 

Big menu and it was pretty hard to choose what to eat. We'll have to come back to try some of the other items. 

We all really enjoyed our food. Our waitress paid just enough attention to us and we always had what we needed. 

Nice Big 10 atmosphere. We were seated under the flag of my husband's alma mater, Indiana. 

Our bill came out to be just under $80; this included 2 beers, an iced tea, 1 appetizer and 3 entrees. Pretty expense dinner out for us, but it was a special occasion. 

Ample parking.

We'll likely return again. Great atmosphere for big groups, family friendly, etc."}
{"text":"I really cannot say anything bad about my experience here. The nachos were massive and delicious, one an average man cannot finish alone. The service was great as well. Multiple big screens and they were extremely accommodating to change the channels to what game we were wanting to watch. I'm absolutely coming back."}
{"text":"This place will offer you a decent lunch if you are looking for a sandwich or salad of the above average variety. The fries were really the best part of the meal! The California Cobb salad was good and had a fair amount of chicken, just way too much dressing. The Billy club sand. Was loaded with beef and again the fries were a hit. The Monterey burger with mushrooms was just simply average. This is what earns the 3 star rating- I wasn't asked how to cook the burger, nor was I offered any choices with condiments. The taste of the burger? It really needed seasoning."}
{"text":"Fish, burgers, fries, veggies and more are all great. If you want a giant pile of amazing nachos then this is your place. Huge fan of the chopped steak burger with Bleu cheese crumble.  Unreal. Service is generally good.  There are quite a few TV monitors for watching the game if that's your thing.  It can be a bit noisy due to the ceiling reflecting sound around you but not terrible. Probably the nicest sports type bar around.  Much more than bar food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for on a whim. Sorry I did. Service good. Food bland. Fatty steak sandwich. Little flavor. Smoked Gouda burger. Little flavor. Fries, yuk.! Tasteless! Overall? Not worth 40 bucks including tip. Far better options in this town and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We made a special trip Saturday to make sure we could get a table Sunday. We were assured a table would be available. When we arrived we were told it would be an hour and a half. Guess what, we needed reservations."}
{"text":"Farm raised salmon. Very bad for you. Such a shame because I would come here for the salmon all the time if it was wild caught"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Great food. A little noisy. Favorite dish: grilled salmon with peach sauce. Ribs are great too. Prime rib on weekends!
Beer selection is good. Amy is my favorite waitress."}
{"text":"Just when I didn't think it could get much worse you totally redeem yourself! Waitress 128 ( The same waitress we didn't have great luck with last time) was on point and the service and food were great. Perhaps we just got her on an off night or maybe a little supplemental training. Whatever the case may be, things were much improved. I would also like to point out that the Barooz management team contacted me regarding my last review and wanted to make amends and offered me so much off my next visit which I appreciated but assured them it wasn't necessary. It's a nice place with a good concept, I just wanted them to continue serving the SW champaign area for a long time even though I live nowhere near there. Kudos again and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We love Billy Barooz, my daughter especially, the food is great, our favorites are the steaks, Nachos, and their pasta dishes like the Billy's Chicken Penne, the service is quick and attentive and the prices are very reasonable considering the portions! Always some to take home! Would recommned Billy Barooz to anyone to try if they haven't already."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The lobster and artichoke dip is everything! I love it so much! Great place for after work drinks. My only complaint is the service. Every time I go in the service is always so poor. It takes forever to get your food, drinks, and checks. Some new servers and this place would be on fire!!"}
{"text":"Went to Billy Barooz after the Illini game this weekend.  It was packed, but  we easily found a seat.  The waitress was awesome and kept our drinks coming despite the place being busy.  She refilled my iced tea 3 times, too!  I had the yellowfin tuna special and my boyfriend had a specialty burger.  My tuna was fantastic.  The wasabi sauce they dressed it with was very unique and tasty.  I didn't care for the snow peas or rice that came as a side.

My boyfriends burger was ok, his french fries were good, and overall, the prices are very affordable.  I'll definitely be back, probably to watch a game, as I think it would be a fun place to hang out to watch sports.  I also saw a artichoke crab dip that I'm planning to order next time!"}
{"text":"Got the moz sticks and the reuben, both were nicely done. Got great service at a Saturday lunch. Thanks, Billy!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday and it was busy, but not too busy.  Our server was very unfriendly and had more tables than she could handle.  It took forever to get anything we ordered, from drinks to appetizers, etc.  

One of the guests we were with didn't even get his food, when she came to check 15 minutes later, we told her we were missing a meal so she went to check.  5 minutes later she comes back and tells us the kitchen forgot to make his meal.  So, about 30 minutes later he got his meal and the whole table was already done eating and ready to get out of there.  

The pasta dish I usually order did not come as I had listed.  It was missing the Capicola ham as described in the menu.  I asked the waitress if the kitchen was out of the Capicola or simply forgot to put it in, she said she would bring me some on the side to place in my pasta.  Kitchen staff brought out a plate of sandwich ham - which is completely not the same thing.  I was very displeased at this.  Not to mention I was charged for nachos at $7 when I ordered a SIDE of chips and salsa which is $2.50. 



*** I would like to update and say that management has contacted me to resolve the conflicts I had. They were very friendly and gracious with their kind words to solve any issue I had. My favorite menu item had recently changed ingredients, which was not relayed to me as the customer so they promised to improve their communications to the returning customers. Very pleased with their management. Kudos. ***"}
{"text":"I live near Billy Barooz, so I pop in from time to time for a beer and a sandwich.  The food is solid, nothing life changing, but consistently good. The place is clean and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is consistently on point and has fantastic food! My usual is the spicy fish tacos (the fish is great here!) that have a real kick and have tons of fish in them. The sweet potato fries are also a must! Delicious, crispy, crunchy and have a scrumptious sugary seasoning."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!  It has the typical sports bar type atmosphere with all of the televisions, etc.  The menu is not typical bar food.  It is wonderful with many varieties.  I had the grilled salmon with peach salsa.  YUM!!!  I had the corn as a side and was very pleasantly surprised to find out that it was fresh and cut off the cob corn and not canned.  If I still lived in the area, I would be here often."}
{"text":"This is a really nice looking sports bar with TV's galore! The burgers are fairly good, but the cocktails here suck."}
{"text":"It's just a sports bar that serves food.  And it's always packed so they must be doing something right.  Service can be spotty but I've never had poor quality food.   And like someone else mentioned, when it's packed it's loud but that seems to be common today in the newer bars/restaurants."}
{"text":"Service here was decent, food was just average. Lots of TVs around if you want to watch a game."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Best steak sandwich in central Illinois. If you are getting an appetizer, go for the nachos."}
{"text":"Billy's is great. Really friendly staff and great service. Love the Jerry Style wings. Never been disappointed. Surprised that they have raw oysters on Friday and Saturday while they last. They are delicious and very fresh. Very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love a place that delivers, and Billy B's does just that, every single time.

Great, extensive bar food menu that is incredibly well-prepared. The pulled pork is especially yummy and you can't go wrong with a burger.

Good drinks. Lots of beer choices. Kid friendly. Lots of sports on tv. Tons of seating, too."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is lacking and it's a very loud environment. This restaurant does accommodate to my severe food allergies which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Food was average (at best!) Service was awful (Seth). I would not go here again. Very diappointed because I've heard good things about this place, but I did not experience anything good on this visit!"}
{"text":"Got to go! Drink prices and selection great. I had their Reuben and it was one of the best I have had. Friend had nacho app and could feed a football team. Wife has spicy chicken and said it was a sweet spicy. Our visit there but will return to try more of menu."}
{"text":"I agree with Jorden B. - the place is like a mini-Damon's with TV screens everywhere, sports regalia on the walls, it has beautiful hard wood floors, tables and booths, the whole place is centered around the bar, but it is wide enough that you don't feel like you are necessarily just going to a \"bar.\" The food was good - I had a Cobb salad and my partner had blackened tilapia. Although the fish was dripping in oil and didn't really taste like fish, my meal and our appetizers were good. It is moderately priced, and definitely a community place. It's convenient for anyone in SW Champaign, and given its location, not many college students were in there (even on a Saturday evening). The lights over the booths were seriously annoying, though - they are the type that hang from the ceiling to within inches of your face so that you constantly feel like there is a hot  flashlight beaming at your face from above. I literally had to do the dorky hand-over-the-brow at times because I squinted throughout our entire meal. Service was decent. Quite obviously high school students and college freshmen, but they had at least been trained the basics of serving. No stalkerish service, yet they did not disappear either. Asked how the food was and refilled the drinks, but did not try to spend the entire time at our booth (even though the place was fairly empty). Gorgeous fireplace, too. I would do it again as long as the light situation were different.

Update:  May 2008
Saturday night with 3 others - it took 30 minutes to get food, although there were empty tables at 6:30pm. We had to get our own refills because our waitress never came back after the food was delivered. That being said, the food was great. BBQ chicken sandwich - huge, tender and sweet. Pasta with steak - creamy and delicious. Billy Burger - good. Some kind of oriental salad - decent. Pepsi products. Prices range from a sandwich ($8) to pasta ($11-15) and steak (to $22).

{"text":"Restaurant review
Every single time I come to Billy Barooz I am surprised by how many people come here. On a Friday night you can find a lot of young professionals enjoying dinner and socializing. Other days are very busy depending on which sports are on TV. We ended up coming on a day when the Cubs were in the playoff hunt. I was pleasantly surprised that we did not have to wait long for a table of 3. I have been here previously and went with the steak dish which was so so. I decided to try the basic of basic bar foods, which was the burger. There was some special burger on the menu with BBQ sauce, bacon, and cheese. I ordered it with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger itself was good, but not very memorable. I can't say that it was exceptional, but there was nothing that was bad with it. If you like sports, bar food, and lots of TVs then you should give Billy Barooz a try, however the food is very pedestrian. 

Pros: lots of TV, inexpensive depending on what you order, the menu constantly changes (check the menu insert for new items)

Cons: can get very busy and a very small waiting area

Hidden deals: None

Health code rating: B. The ratings are so so with a lot of issues revolving around restaurant cleanliness. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=491"}
{"text":"My dad is obsessed with this place. He's also obsessed with sports (big Illini + baseball fan) so it's fitting. Definitely a place to go if you want to watch a game on the many TV's and have a couple beers and nachos. For dinner though, the menu is pretty good. I've had many things on the menu and haven't been upset yet. I'd say it can please just about anyone fairly well. Also, the service has always been excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home picking up dinner to go. My wife enjoys the salmon salad and the server recommended the Mexican salad for me. I'm having an O'Doul's at the bar while I wait for my order. We returned again and my wife enjoyed the ribeye with asparagus as the side. I had to have the Mexican salad with chicken again. I find it delicious and pretty filling. I'm not big on salads, yet I sure like it."}
{"text":"Three stars because the food and beer list are really good, not four stars because all the seating is bar style seat yourself, which totally sucks when it's Ohio State weekend and there are 1 million age 50+ ohio state fans in town clogging up all the tables.

If you want to go to a crowded sports bar, go to Guido's so you can see people under the age of 65 and not have to drive all the fucking way out to Windsor and Duncan."}
