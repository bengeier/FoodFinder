{"text":"LOVE this place! Sesame and matcha ice cream are both really flavourful, but a little lacking in texture (too grainy for my taste). My favourites are the parfaits, or anmitsu, with mochi and fruit. 

This place is cute but don't plan on staying in store as they don't have a lot of space, definitely better for takeaway."}
{"text":"I got the matcha and black sesame swirl and it was amazing. My two favourite flavours in one. My life is complete! The waffle cone was crispy and the ice cream was rich in flavour. If you love matcha and black sesame, this is the place for you. I'm glad I don't have to go mission to downtown for good soft serve ice cream. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the soft serve. 3 stars for the price. 

Black sesame is sweet and matcha is a bit bitter. Together, they make a refreshing combo! Be warned, the cone does leak really quickly. Expect an empty space in the centre of your soft serve when you dig in. 

Tldr; Great taste. Ok price. Leaky cone."}
{"text":"Ordered one of those matcha soft icecream with fruits and toppings on the side, forgot what it's called, but the one I ordered comes with fruits like kiwi, strawberry and banana ...  The icecream was ok.. But the person who took my orders, took my money with his hands and use the same hands cutting kiwi and strawberry and placed them in the plastic container around the icecream. He had no intention to hide it and it disgusted the hell out of me. 

And customer service was quite bad...  The cashier had no emotions no facial expressions, and it even made us feel like we did something wrong. 

I don't feel welcomed coming to this place, don't think I will visit again."}
{"text":"I like it! I got the swirl in a cup.the sesame flavour is very good and you can feel the matcha chunks!"}
{"text":"It's 3.5.

We had:

-Kurogoma frappe aka black sesame ($6.25):  Good sesame taste.  Nice mixture with the red bean on top.  Rating: 3.25/5

-Matcha au lait frappe ($6.25): Very good strong matcha taste.  Rating: 4/5

Limited seating.  2 larger tables and 3-4 smaller tables. 

Cash or debit(minimum $5) only.  No credit cards."}
{"text":"Icecream is really good and the flavour is really strong. Only problem i have is that the size is really small. For the amount i paid for the icecream, i expect a little more."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend after seeing some instagram posts about the black sesame and matcha ice cream soft serve. There was a selection of desserts but I didn't take a good look at them as I was more interested in the ice cream. 
I got the mini swirl and it was very good! It was the right amount of ice cream and for $3(+tax), it was a good price. The matcha wasn't too strong and I actually preferred the black sesame. It had good texture and was quite creamy. My friend got the Black Sesame Kinako Azuki Shiratama and it was quite a bit. I didn't like the mochi but he enjoyed it overall.  

The location was clean and wasn't too busy on a Sunday evening. 

I wish they had places like this in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after lunch with the hubs today. 

We got the Black sesame and matcha soft serve swirl in a cone and a matcha soft serve in a cup.  

The matcha soft serve has a really strong matcha taste.  If you don't love green tea or matcha that much, I would avoid it.  The matcha flavour is so strong, that it's almost bitter.  My husband had the matcha ice cream alone and he felt like it made his mouth feel really dry after. 

Matcha isn't my favourite thing in the world so I got the black sesame and matcha ice cream swirl.  The black sesame is definitely good and really offsets the bitterness of the matcha flavour.  In fact, perhaps it even masks it which may be a good thing for me.  

Besides the flavour of the soft serve, I want to touch on the price.  In my opinion, it's pretty expensive for soft serve ice cream.  I know other matcha soft serve places are of a similar price point, but really....6 dollars for an ice cream cone is a bit on the pricier side.  

Lastly the store itself.  It's a mess.  There were mops hanging out for all the customers to see, the display case had boxes that were haphazardly piled.  It didn't look organized or super clean.  For aesthetic sake, I really think they need to clean up a bit and put their cleaning supplies far away from the food preparation area."}
{"text":"I tried the matcha/black sesame twist soft-serve in a cup. Great flavour and texture! The toastiness of the black sesame almost reminded me of the taste of cake! The matcha was strong and not too sweet. Only downside was the big hole in the middle--wish they filled the cup all the way. 

We also had unsweetened genmaicha with matcha. Very refreshing as a cold drink. The roasted flavour of the genmaicha and slight bitterness of the matcha complimented the twist ice-cream perfectly. 

I'd go back to try their other desserts! The matcha cream puff calls my name ;)"}
{"text":"Tried the black sesame/matcha swirl soft serve cone. The black sesame tastes great, but overpowers the matcha as you lick your way through the cone. There was a problem with the soft serve machine that resulted in a short delay. To our surprise, we were given the matcha daifuku mochi on the house, which we quite enjoyed- even more so than the soft serve. It had the perfect matcha flavour, striking a good balance with the creme filling. I would recommend trying that!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice before and it was really good. The ice cream is rich in flavour but when I went again tonight I was unimpressed. There was a 25 minute wait. I ordered 3 cups of ice cream to go, the cashier didn't mention that they don't have take out. Not only did the ice cream get smaller in portion, they had no lids, no bag, no tray. They're not ready for business. I paid $15 for ice cream to have it end up all over my car. Ice cream is still tasty though."}
{"text":"The matcha soft serve here got the bitterness from the rich matcha taste with the creamy soft ice cream, it's a perfect match! You've got to try it!"}
{"text":"This little dessert place is such a gem! They have authentic black sesame and matcha soft serve along with drinks. The owner is very patient in recommending drinks to try and service is quite fast. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I visited Tendou during their grand opening weekend.  Ordered both the matcha and black sesame soft serve separately.  The matcha soft serve has a very strong and rich matcha taste and the bitterness from the matcha is very noticeable.  Personally I like strong matcha taste but prefer the bitter taste tone down with more creamy texture.  The texture is not as creamy as I would like.  The black sesame soft serve was a bit disappointing because I didn't really taste too much difference from the black sesame ice-cream I normally get from the supermarket.  When mixing both together, the more sweet black sesame does balance out well with the matcha.  Overall, these are still decent desserts and it is great to see newer Japanese style dessert places opening uptown."}
{"text":"I loved their the ice cream so did my friends. The Matcha ice cream was delicious and also their matcha chocolate cake. Staff were friendly and helpful but the menu was a little confusing so we had to ask lots of questions until we decided. It is a bit pricey but since it's matcha and matcha itself expensive I think it is worth it! Their opening hours are good cause we craved the ice cream pretty late and they were open. I would like to give them 4.5 but since it's not possible I will give them 5!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends at night & also took my grandma & we both LOVE THE BLACK SESAME soft serve on a cone!

You get a lot more in a cone than in a cup!
The green tea soft serve with red bean& rice balls was a bit small for $6.8 ~~ my hubby and I had our own cup and killed it in no time ~~ 

Also has the black sesame slush, not bad, but would say it's a bit tasteless and plain~ too much ice, not enough black sesame"}
{"text":"Plain and simple. We wanted soft serve black sesame and green tea ice cream on a waffle. We got it, it was delicious. Never got the ice cream with the other fixings but we would come back to try.

There is only one machine serving the ice cream so when it gets busy you may be waiting sometimes."}
{"text":"Bold flavoured swirl soft serve! Both the matcha and black sesame were very delicious. There could be more seating in the store though."}
{"text":"The matcha soft serve is ok.  Can have more seats.  For Ontario, there should be a Point of Sale rebate of 8% on prepared meals (food and beverages) $4.00 and under.  Just don't understand why they charge 13% HST for a mini cone that costs $3.  Should the tax be only 5% instead?"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of soft serve ice cream. Matcha and black sesame are my fav. Great dessert place in Markham"}
{"text":"We not knowingly went during their grand opening weekend and immediately saw a line up (this was around 10PM).

We decided we had nothing better to do so we waited about 20 minutes. Unfortunately they ran out of all the sundaes but we were still able to get their soft serve. 

We tried the swirl (mix of black sesame and matcha) on a cone. The portions we received were very noticeable in size. The amount of soft serve given was definitely less versus the actual cone size. 

In terms of taste, the sesame was very fragrant and flavourful which mostly over powered the matcha. Matcha had more of the bitter taste but we liked the sesame better. 

Overall, the soft serve is good but wouldn't say it's worth the wait..We understand that they don't have control over the amount of customers that come, but I think Tendou can improve on their portions for the amount customers are paying ($5.50/cone) . 

Worth the try but it's probably best to visit another time when there's no line up!"}
{"text":"Came here craving some matcha desserts.  I had a hard time choosing since there were so many to choose from.  The owner was very nice and explained the matcha types to us and what was used in the drinks etc.  They also gave me a sample of their matcha soft serve to try.  The matcha soft serve was delicious with an intense matcha flavour. Ended up ordering a matcha au lait frappe which was good.  It had red bean on top, tasted as good as it looks.  The black sesame frappe was also very flavorful and smooth, a must try for black sesame lovers.  Cant wait to try more of their other desserts."}
{"text":"A really interesting ice cream place. There's really two main items of interest here, matcha soft serve and black sesame soft serve. 
The matcha soft serve really tastes like matcha, has that grassy, slightly bitter flavour. Not too sweet and very delicious, especially if you like green tea. 

Black sesame is sweet, a nice nutty flavour. I like this one better than the matcha. 

There is a twist, I did not get this but eating the matcha after the black sesame really accentuated the bitterness of the matcha. I'm not sure how good the twist would be because of this. 

Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Not the best matcha place ever. The taste was very faint and does not match the price you have to pay."}
{"text":"We came as a group on a Saturday afternoon. They were quiet so we didn't have to wait long to order. They specialize in matcha desserts We tried the mango green tea, tofu cheese cake, duo twist soft serve with red bean, and mochi balls. 


The mango green tea was nothing special. They used mango flavour tea powder. The tofu cheese cake was yum! A little lighter than normal cheese cake, with a hint of tofu flavour. The duo twist consisted of sesame & matcha soft serve. The toppings work well with the twist. 

Would recommend if you're in the mood for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is a very simple review. 

Amazing matcha soft serve
Amazing black sesame soft serve
Amazing waffle cone

it's simply the best.

Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"Located along Highway 7 in a huge plaza with restaurants, salons, and random stores. 

Tendou specializes in Matcha (green-tea) flavoured treats. I am not a huge cake-guy, so I opted for the half black sesame/half matcha soft serve ice cream. You can definately taste the best of both worlds, however, I wish I had gotten the matcha so I could truly taste its full flavour.

All in all, a nice little place for desserts with decent seating and tables available. The ice cream cone came out to about $5 (for swirl). I will return in the summer!"}
{"text":"Came here for their matcha soft serve and their black sesame frappe. I wasn't sure what to order at first and asked the guy working if I could get a sample ice cream, he gave me a generous portion even for just a sample. 

Matcha ice cream was great - intense matcha flavour, good balance of sugar and cream. Had a bit of matcha bitterness in the ice cream. 

Black sesame frappe was a bit flat. It had a good black sesame flavour to it but something about a black sesame ice drink felt a bit odd to me. Its usually a warm Chinese dessert and I personally wasn't so sure about this. 

Still a cash only place, their menu didn't even have the prices for the soft serve yet 

Highly recommend the soft serve if nothing else!"}
{"text":"Tried this place when I heard about their mini cones. I tried both their matcha and black sesame soft serve and it's surprisingly much better than what I expected! I've tried matcha soft serve at many different places and only Tendou's is comparable to the soft serve in Japan! I finally found the a place to satisfy my soft serve cravings! The matcha soft serve is very very strong in matcha taste and not too sweet. The black sesame soft serve actually has black sesame taste! Not very sweet and also very tasty! I would highly recommend both flavours!"}
{"text":"Simple yet awesome flavour. The blackm sesame soft ice cream was not too grainy. The service is quick and the place is quite clean. Just go and try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While I enjoyed my black sesame and matcha swirl soft serve, my husband's anmitsu with just matcha ice cream was a little strong on the matcha flavour.  The black sesame seems to tone it down.  I prefer the ice cream at Woofles and Cream."}
{"text":"It's really more like a 4.5! I'm a matcha connoisseur, I love that stuff and order it at whatever opportunity I get. Matcha ice cream, lattes, cakes, I love it all. I was so excited for a matcha dessert to open up in Markham so I wouldn't have venture downtown for some matcha goodies. Throw in black sesame that is typically hard to find at most dessert places and you've got one happy customer right here :) 

Their soft serve is amazing! Strong matcha flavour and not overly sweet paired with the black sesame that has a nutty earthy flavour, no wonder I get these intense Tendou's cravings. I have also had their sundae's with fruit, red bean paste and mochi and that's really good too.  

I have yet to try their drinks and cakes since their soft serve always calls my name. Knocking off 0.5 stars because their $5 dollar cone is way too big for me. I wish they would have their $2 cones all year around. 

Tip: The store is kind of small, a few tables and that's it. If you need to use the washroom, its avaliable in the basement where the parking garage is."}
{"text":"Over the weekend, there was a promo going on for Buy 1 Drink Get 1 Matcha Cream Puff Free!  Not sure if the promo is still going on right, but I find myself going back to Tendou once a month or so anyway.

It's pretty unique to Markham, and is a casual spot to catch a quick dessert when the mood strikes.  Although if you actually want to sit there, I'd recommend either going early or late, avoiding the 7-9pm range when the line's at its busiest.
The matcha cream puff was a too dense for my liking, and the Hokkaido Milk Drink to be perfectly honest tastes like powdered milk and nothing like the fresh stuff, so I'd say skip it.  

The matcha or black sesame ice cream though? Those are pretty decent; though if you pick the two flavours swirled together, the matcha completely dominates over the black sesame...despite the fact that the matcha isn't quite as strong as some other matcha dessert spots in the city.

I like that it brings another dessert option to the area.  Just remember to either bring cash or use your debit card."}
{"text":"Owner is next to useless and gets in to the way of service at this establishment.

The Soft Serve Ice Cream is decent but it is not even advertised on their menu which is a huge oversight on the management. 

Orders Matcha Lemonade and it took forever and it tasted like water with food colouring, and my friend had the Hoikaido which tasted like sugar and then air. 

We clearly complained next to the owner who showed little interest in making it right. 

Would rather spend my money anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"$2 mini cones from July 8th-10th! Enjoy!

I enjoyed the softserve swirl. The flavour of matcha and black sesame goes so well together. I am not crazy about the toppings, I mostly like my softserve in a waffle cone, nice and simple. The matcha I find a bit on the bitter side but still good. 

I would come back again for the black sesame or the swirl."}
{"text":"I got black sesame soft serve and sundae with the swirl + mochi + red bean....the sundae was OK, but nothing special.  found the red bean to be too sweet.  If you like sesame, don't get it in a swirl because the green tea flavor overpowers the sesame.  the cone was better than the sundae."}
{"text":"I've been to this place multiple times, and every time has been a disappointment. The second time I came with friends, we ordered their drinks and a few types of ice cream. The matcha ice cream was so bitter and lumpy it made us all want to go out and throw it out right away. The menu is not priced fairly and there are SO MANY other better dessert options in the area, such as Dessert Kitchen which is across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Matcha Ice Cream. Matcha flavour is rich and the ice cream is creamy. The taste of matcha is really close to the authentic Japanese matcha. The quality of ice cream is good but the price is a bit expensive."}
{"text":"While the plaza itself has lots of parking (underground/outdoor), the plaza is extremely busy all the time and discourages me from coming here for a quick snack - which is all there is to Tendou because there are only a few tables here.  The unit before Tendou used to be a to-go sandwich shop (I think) and Tendou has retained most of their previous renovations.  

Regarding the menu - there are only a few options.  This isn't a huge problem as their matcha ice cream is really good!  I like that it's a lot of matcha and even tastes a bit bitter.  Highly recommend the matcha/seasame swirl option! I would love to see other varieties in the future.  Average menu item will be between $6-$10 depending on what you get.  This would be okay if there are more tables to sit at.

As mentioned, there are only a few tables here - not suitable for large groups!  This is especially annoying in the winter time if there's no place to sit and you can hardly carry your ice cream outdoor.  The space could be better utilized to add a few more round tables - hopefully this will be improved in the future."}
{"text":"I`ve tried numerous of matcha ice cream place around the GTA, and found the matcha here less bitter than other competitor. It has the matcha flavour and also the dairy flavour you look for in a soft serve. Don't miss out on the sesame, as it is the best I found in town"}
{"text":"Yum! I got their black sesame and green tea swirl in a cup ($5.50). I was pleasantly surprised by their soft serve. It was fantastic!! The green tea was very authentic and it actually tasted like legitimate matcha. Usually matcha is overly sweetened and not bitter like what real matcha is like. The black sesame was also very good. Both flavours were creamy and the perfect amount sweetness. The combo of them together was just right! I would recommend getting the short serve swirl!! I actually prefer Tendou than Tsujiri (matcha/japanese dessert place in Toronto). I will definitely come back again!!
They also have free wifi!"}
{"text":"I really like them pairing the sesame ice cream with matcha but unfortunately the sesame is over powering to the matcha and the matcha ice cream itself was not bold enough in flavours."}
{"text":"Got the azuki frappe and it was way too sweet.

Service was like a regular bubble tea place with no customer engagement.  

I'd rather visit their Japanese competitor in downtown."}
{"text":"There are better options right around the corner, but this one is decent too with some unique icecream choices that are harder to come by (i.e. black seame)."}
{"text":"Yummy! I've come here a couple of times and always enjoyed their soft serve. The matcha is really rich and the black sesame was excellent. I prefer Tendou more than Tsujiri hands down. They recently came out with the smaller cones, which is great since it was difficult for me to finish the waffle cone. :) Would definitely recommend!

Cash and debit only. Debit for purchases over $5."}
{"text":"Located in the Flato Markham development plaza across Hwy 7 from the Markham Theatre (near St. Louis Bar and Grill), is Tendou! I've seen them in Instagram and of course here on Yelp and I'll be honest, I was more than a little interested in trying their matcha and sesame soft serve flavours after reading the reviews.

Parking here is a royal pain in the ass, that was until I discovered the underground parking - what a blessing! Pro-tip just go straight for the underground, park on P1 and take the elevators  back up to G - the entrance to tendou is immediately on your left! #Winning.

It's a normal sized shop with about 10-15 seats and a menu of beverages and ice cream and ice cream concoctions. I explained to the owner I was new to these flavours and he offered me a sample of the sesame! WOW - it was nothing like I expected, because the seasame is toasted it actually ends up giving the ice cream a peanut butter flavour! Amazing!

He recommended I go for the matcha sesame swirl so i did (in a cup).

Matcha normally isn't my bag but I figured I would give it a chance here - still not my bag. It was chalky to me and overpowered the sesame flavour that I was looking forward to so much after my sample. Blecchhhh. 

Still though, Loved that sesame and I would go back just for that. 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"We went Saturday of grand opening weekend at 930pm. Line up was long but once we ordered our desserts came right away (sundae was fast but soft serve cone and drinks take long) 

I liked the black sesame flavour much better than the matcha which I prefer to be slightly more sweet. I thought the matcha didn't have a strong enough flavour and the fruit in my fruit shiratama sundae overpowered any matcha I ate. 

6.50$ for the sundae but cheaper than other matcha places so it was a good price. The menu is hard to tell the server what you want and she actually messed up my order but whatever. The menu is horizontally: sesame, matcha, swirl. Then vertically: cone, fruit, fruit shiratama, mochi, shiratama. Even the cashier got mixed when I told her I wanted matcha fruit shiratama and sesame shiratama.

Will I line up for this again? No. If there is no line up will I go? Yea. Will I go out of my way to eat here? No."}
{"text":"Matcha soft serve, can't go wrong! The texture is smooth and the flavour is right - not too strong but still enough for it to be distinctly matcha. When I got here Saturday evening, the place was pretty busy - they had even run out of the novel black sesame soft serve ice cream! We were down for dessert, so we grabbed some drinks (much was matcha/green tea themed) and some little cake slices. The guy behind cash was friendly and helpful - willing to answer all our questions about every menu item.

We picked up the kirifuda cake (blackcurrant and hazelnut), the new raspberry pistachio cake, hot genmaicha tea, matcha soft serve, Hokkaido frappe, and cold mango pineapple sencha tea. We also grabbed matcha daifukus later on into the night.

The cakes are a bit pricy for their size, but understandable given their detail and unique flavours. The raspberry pistachio is a new item, and didn't live up to expectations. The raspberry glaze layer was sticky and extremely tough - a sharp fork is needed and it's still sticky. The pistachio is lost after the struggle of cutting into the cake and the raspberry flavour. The kirifuda provided much more balance between the blackcurrant and hazelnut flavours - and its mousse fruit flavour layer was easier to eat. If not for the $6.50 price tag, I would be back more often.

The genmaicha I ordered was exactly as expected - hot tea, genmaicha flavour coming through but excessively, served at a ready to drink temperature. Around the table there were no complaints on the drinks! My hot drink came with an adorably hand-doodled cup sleeve - I guess staff were looking to pass some time? The attention to details made the experience that much better for our late night gathering.

Finally, the matcha daifuku - a full size mochi ball with matcha creme filling and red bean filling. Matcha and red bean are a natural pair, but if you're not a fan of actual beans in your dessert it may feel odd. The matcha filling was plentiful, making it a satisfying chewy outer, smooth inner treat.

The key to this place that made it enjoyable was the relaxed atmosphere, accessible location, and yummy treats. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tendou specializes in two flavours - matcha and black sesame. I personally love matcha and the soft-serve here has me coming back again and again. I usually get the soft-serve with shiratama and fresh fruit - very creamy and absolutely delicious. I hear good things about the black sesame as well. No complaints, except that I wish there was more seating inside.

Oh and there is a pretty active Pokemon Go gym nearby so you can battle while enjoying your soft-serve."}
{"text":"I've only tried their iced tea drinks. They also have a few options for non caffeinated drinks. I always go for the matcha slushie or the matcha picked latte. There is a black sesame slushie which is also very nice. 
They don't have any bubbles as a food option but it's a nice alternative and to be honest what matters is the drink is consistent in flavour and I'm very happy with the drinks I've been getting."}
{"text":"Definitely love me some matcha, but can't say the same when it comes to soft serve. It's very flavorful, but I enjoy the black sesame much better. It does tend to get busy during peak times like weekends or just right after dinner, so come earlier if you want to avoid line ups. Service is pretty standard and quick, and they have a decent selection of different combo flavours. A definite must try if in the area and craving something sweet."}
{"text":"Wow, I know I am a little late for this, but I finally can enjoy the sesame matcha softserve icecream instead of goinf downtown either to Tsujiri or Uncle Tetsu.  

Tendou has very little seating space, but it is just enough if you just want to enjoy icecream during the hot summer.  I wish there is a little music on background which usually helps to set the mood.  It was okay.  The twist icecream on a waffle cone was $5.50 plus tax and it sure was yummy.  The sesame icecream was really creamy with wonderful balance of the milky and sesamey flavour; the matcha icecream was just heaven with just enough milk to mask the grassy flavour.  It was just a wonderful combination of the two flavours.

On a hot day, this softserve icecream is just a perfect compliment.  Enjoy guys!"}
{"text":"Got the matcha soft serve in cup. 

Hands down one of the best matcha soft serve i have had. Mainly because I am someone who does not have a sweet tooth and am very picky with my desserts. 

The bitter sweet from the matcha kicks in first and then you taste the creaminess of the soft serve after. Best sequence in taste and texture for this kind of food. 

Highly recommend! Will come back when less line ups!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of matcha so of course decided to check this place out! Got the matcha soft serve in a cone and it costed five dollars. There really isn't much flavours besides matcha and black sesame so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're looking for other flavours. Overall I would say this place is average and if you're a fan of matcha, you'll probably like it here!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Tendou this past weekend and I'm a fan! 

I tried the matcha soft serve cone and it was delicious - it had a very nice matcha flavour with a slight bitterness as an aftertaste. The soft serve was still very smooth unlike some of the matcha cones I've had in Japan. 

I'm interested to try their matcha latte and matcha milk tea in the future."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

I am a sucker for matcha and black sesame desserts. I was so excited when I found out there was a new Japanese dessert place in Markham. The owner told us there were more items aside from the drinks on the menu. I liked how they had a Tiffany Blue wall. For people like me who loved to take food pictures, this wall made a great background for food photography :) They have several tables in the store which is good for having desserts. There was no line up (I was there around 7pm) which I loved! 

-- Food and Drink --

We ordered 2 items:

1. Matcha Soft Serve 
- Their matcha soft serve has a strong scent of green tea taste. I like the strong  bitterish tea taste and how creamy the soft serve is. I noticed whenever I have softserve from other places, the icecream melts quickly and it starts to drip off my cone (which is very messy). BUT this does not happen to the soft serve cone at Tendou! The cone remains crispy and crunchy until I finish everything! :) 

2. Kurogoma (Black Sesame) Frappe
- There was a strong taste and smell of black sesame. I could see actual black sesames in the drink. It is definitely a must-try item for black sesame lovers. The only thing to complain about is that the red beans on the drink are very hard. It would be better if they cooked the red bean longer or used the red bean paste instead. 

3. Hoikaido frappe sample
- The owner offered 2 cups of Hoikkaido frappe samples for us to drink. Since they used Hoikaido milk, the drink was very creamy and had a strong milk taste! Love it! 

4. During my second visit, I ordered a Black Sesame Soft Serve on a cone
- Their black sesame softserve was definitely the best in Toronto (at least the best one that I have ever tried). They were generous on their ingredients, you could taste and see a lot of sesame chunks in the soft serve. It wasn't as creamy as the matcha ones but the sesame chunks added texture to the ice-cream. Both my husband and I love the black sesame soft serve more than the matchan ones! :) 

-- Overall --

I love this place since I don't have to go all the way to downtown and line up for 50 minutes for a decent Matcha softserve. I would definitely come back to order their matcha and black sesame icecream again. 

Note: They only taking cash or debit card for now."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

This review is based on their matcha soft serve only. If you are a lover of matcha and tired of other places skimping on the flavour then definitely give this one a try. 

Folks who are used to the sweeter and more subtle matcha flavoured soft serves may want to start with the twist. The texture of the soft serve is thick and creamy just the way it should be.

Will update the rating as needed when I try out their drink selections."}
{"text":"Tried the swirl soft serve. The matcha flavour was strong and flavourful, though for some it might be a little on the bitter side (though I personally like that bitterness). The black sesame was just amazing--the perfect amount of flavour and sweetness! The ice cream was super smooth and creamy, and for $5 I'd say the soft serve was definitely worth it. Will have to go back to get black sesame again...this was literally the best black sesame ANYTHING I've ever had."}
{"text":"Green tea and black sesame twist ice cream is my favourite, definitely not the cheapest ice cream. Be ready to pay roughly 6 dollar or more. They have a variety of different dessert as well but so far I've only tried their ice cream. Their technique of filling could be better as the centre is always hollow trying to cut cost down. With that price I think I deserve a full cone but my personal opinion. 
Not much seating in the store so be ready to take your items"}
{"text":"The green tea ice cream was rich in flavour and not too sweet like normal ice cream. The black sesame ice cream was also rih in flavour but had a normal amount of sugar for ice cream. When they served our ice cream in a cup it looked like a huge portion, like it was worth our money. But when we started digging our spoon into it, it was hollow. To be honest, I rather pay a decent amount of money and get what I paid for. Don't false advertise and make it look huge when in reality the space inside the swirl of ice cream was hollow.  There black sesame mille crepe cake was different and it had a nice flavour and texture. They provided stainless steel spoons and I still had trouble cutting a spoonful of cake. I think mille crepe cakes are supposed to be a little softer.  I don't want to have to ask for a knife with my cake. We asked for water and they came in these really cute glasses and their water was clean tasting (no hard minerals). Cashier and helper both smiled and were very polite."}
{"text":"Tried their matcha milk tea. It was kinda diluted and I couldn't taste much of the matcha. It was one size and the portion was pretty descent. I might go back to try their soft serve...but not their drinks"}
{"text":"We came the weekend before valentine's day and they were have a promotion on some of their pastries and boy, was I happy that we decided to try them out. They were absolutely delicious - the matcha and Hokkaido cream puffs. Mmm yum! We also grabbed some ice cream... That swirl of sesame and matcha, yum! Next time I'd like to try just the matcha and I felt the sesame flavour a bit overpowering relative to the matcha. Great texture and will be back!"}
{"text":"Why is food so expensive nowadays?  Lols.  Anyhow this is probably the best place (I know of) where you can get black sesame soft serve this yummy.  The staff is very nice and gave me a plastic cup when I complained of dripping ice cream from the cone.  Seating is limited but that's cool.  I feel like this place will be a good hangout for summer times, maybe not so much during the winter when everyone is wearing big jackets.  I was really hoping that the prices would be lower, but I see that everything is expensive nowadays so meh.

Overall, pretty good ice cream place.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"I came here through yelp reviews as well as instagram posts. The images looked great and the flavours also tasted amazing! This ice cream shop gets their japanese matcha powder shipped from southern Fukuoka, Japan. If you are not a black sesame or a matcha fan then its not really your place however if you like both then it is definitely a must try! I got their popular seller, matcha-black sesame swirl soft serve in a cup, and boy is it mind-blowing! It definitely has that \"oomph\" of a matcha flavour where it is definitely stronger than many other matcha soft serving places but not too much to ruin the creamy ice cream texture! Fortunately for me, I work nearby and I will definitely come back to this location! I also tried their sesame smoothie but I prefer the soft serve for that flavour! As for the atmosphere, it is relaxing and down-to-earth with a clean space. Service was okay and nothing special however they did give quite a generous amount.
Ps. Come during the day time if possible because the evenings usually gets crowded!"}
{"text":"Hmm, not gonna lie, but I'm not a fan of matcha to begin with. I came by with a couple friends that were really excited to come and they say it was really good.

A small location with very little room to stay and eat, they provide some unique choices that you may not always find elsewhere. Unfortunately, their unique selection can seem a bit limiting if you're not into those flavors. With that said, there is an option that seems to be quite a hit. If you get a Match Green Tea & Black Sesame swirl, it is an unlikely combo that compliments each other quite well.

Overall, an excellent place to come if you like either matcha or black sesame, but I would warn you that they can run out of the black sesame flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious soft serve ice cream. We ordered both the black sesame and matcha soft serve. The black sesame was really good. Not too sweet and the sesame taste not overbearing. The matcha I didn't really like. It has a really strong flavour almost to the point of tasting bitter. They give you a good amount of ice cream but as other yelpers have noted it is hollow in the middle. Parking can be a bit of a nightmare though so I probably won't be back very often. Small space with only a few tables."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving matcha ice cream, this is the place to go! The location of this place is quite small, with limited seatings. 

My favourite thing to get here is the matcha and black sesame swirl soft serve. The combination of the two definitely compliments each other really well. I have also tried the green tea latte here too, and that was pretty decent. 

As for the service, the workers there were always friendly. Most of all, I would definitely come back here again for their soft serve ice cream!"}
{"text":"This plaza is slowly booming with hip new restaurants.  Tendou is no exception.   

The owners appear to be Japanese and were happy to explain about their menu options.   

The shop is a quaint store with minimal seating.   Good to chat with 1-2 people and enjoy the view (aka.  The parking lot outside). 

I had a delicious delicious matcha frappe!  Full of matcha flavour and not full of sugar.    So worth the price.   I can't wait to come back and try their ice cream."}
{"text":"I really love matcha and black sesame ice cream. First time I had black sesame ice cream was at Woofles and Cream and I thought it was good there but this place blows it out of the water. 

I came with the hubs and he ordered a matcha cone and I had a black sesame cone so we can sample both. They offer a twist with matcha and black sesame but I didn't want to mix the flavours like that. 

First the matcha really had the matcha flavour. There is a little bit of the after taste, but that's the same after taste you get with matcha tea when it's flavourful. So I quite enjoyed it. Compare that to woofles and cream's version, where there isn't much matcha flavour and watered down.

The black sesame ice cream, oh drool. I am craving it again this morning as I type this. If I lived in those condos nearby I'd go everyday and maybe twice a day! The nuttiness and creaminess that reminded me of peanut butter . I didn't find it grainy at all like other Yelpers have mentioned. 

Both were excellent! Very flavourful and not too sweet but I loved the black sesame more. 

As other Yelpers have mentioned, parking is bad in the plaza, but plenty of underground parking. Line wasn't so bad on a weeknight at around 9pm...had about 6 people in front of us. The tables were full though. Very little seating area but we enjoyed our dessert outside. In the middle of the parking lot there is a concrete walkway where you can sit. 

Other things I loved about this place, they didn't cheap out. They filled the ice cream from the bottom of the cone. And when they were putting ice cream into the cone, there's a little bit of tissue wrapped on the bottom of the cone so staff can handle it and they made an effort to not touch the actual cone. I'm a bit of a germaphobe so I really appreciate little things like that. 

So excited that this place opened up!"}
{"text":"Got the Twist Cone and a Matcha Swirl in a Cup. The Black Sesame balances out the bitterness of the Matcha flavour and makes the perfect combination! 

If you enjoy Matcha on the sweeter side then I would not recommend getting the Matcha flavour itself. I enjoyed the flavours together more than tasting them alone.

The service was good and got our ice creams very quickly! 

Also a plus that they're open pretty late."}
{"text":"Perfect place for matcha and other Japanese sweets 
If you'd like the traditional matcha flavour the ice cream is a MUST!!!!
The mix flavour of matcha and sesame is also a must try 


I'm personally into the matcha milk tea , the Hokkaido Milkshake and Black sesame milk shake is creamy and soft. 

Everyone can find something that suits them for sure :D"}
{"text":"Tried both the green tea and the black sesame softserve.  The regular portion size is hugee and definitely can be shared :)

I found the green tea to not have enough tea flavour while being a too creamy and thick. I couldn't finish this on my own for sure due to the texture alone.  It could also be sweeter, but I think its quite difficult to strike that perfect balance of sweet versus green tea bitterness.  The black sesame is better than the green tea but a tad too sweet."}
{"text":"Matcha soft serve is the best with strong and long lasting aftertaste. Do NOT order their black sesame frappe!! No flavour at all."}
{"text":"They offer mini matcha and black sesame cones for $3 each. Win win!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last week.   It was not bad, flavours were good for the matcha and sesame.   Had a twist and the flavours work well together.  I wish they cut the mochi a Lil bit more so easier to eat.

Staff was really friendly, and service was good.

My only negative would be the serving size to price.   My item was around $8 and the cup is really small. The pictures you order from on the menu is a bit deceiving for what you get."}
{"text":"Holy moley!! I've had my fair share of all things matcha from bubble teas to ice creams to pastries and other desserts... AND DAYUUUUM, this place has the best soft serve I've EVER had!!

I ordered a matcha and black sesame twist soft serve in a cup and both flavours were so so so delicious! It was thick and creamy, and INCREDIBLY rich. There's no doubt that they use high quality and authentic ingredients here, which is clearly shown by its slightly grittier texture. 

My boyfriend got a black sesame frappe (kurogoma frappe) topped with a scoop of red beans and it was also a super refreshing and delicious drink!

I am in love with Tendou!! Finally, a place that does justice to matcha!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! I love Matcha ice cream. It's DELICIOUS! I've had Matcha soft serve before at Pacific Mall on the upstairs floor and this place blew that ice cream stand out of the waters.

The Matcha flavour was amazing! And the two asian girls running the front cash were so sweet, one of them could draw really well! I mentioned it was my first time there and they gave me extra soft serve on top on my cone. 

Downside is that it cost $5 for one cone but I don't mind the price it was really tasty!"}
{"text":"Love love love their swirl soft serve. Matcha and sesame soft serve--perfection. I've hunted through a ridiculous amount of places in Markham and Toronto for the perfect sesame soft serve/ice cream and I think I've finally found it. 

Their prices for their cones/cups are reasonable (I don't recommend the bowls with the added toppings) and the wait time isn't ridiculous unlike Tsujiri downtown. They have daily specials like matcha cream puffs, matcha/black sesame creme brulee, and tofu cheesecake but these are subject to availability (they sold out of the cream puffs when I went). 

Just an FYI for people with small stomachs like me: go for the smaller cone portion (they don't write it on the menu but this is an option). It's literally half the regular price ($3!!!!) and it perfectly satisfies your cravings. I couldn't finish my swirl cone because it was a ridiculous amount of ice cream. But if you have a bigger appetite, go for the regular cup. The cone looks amazing for the insta but on a regular day just isn't worth the extra dollar."}
{"text":"This is the first time I am visiting this place and from the looks of things, matcha related desserts is one of their main focus, which is good news to me as I love matcha flavored dessert. :)

I visited this place after dinner so dessert would be my choice so I decided to order the Warabi Mochi (Matcha) and the Macha Latte as a first timer! So this is the place where you place the order and then you grab the food and then you sit at the table and enjoy the treats! The place has only a few tables but fortunately there are couple of empty tables so I have no problem finding a table to sit... But if not, I can always eat it outside, no big deal.. 

As for the dessert ... for the Warabi Mochi, it is served in a clear plastic bowl, and inside it, there is a big swirl of matcha ice cream, and then besides the ice cream, there are some mochi and then a round ball of red bean paste on top. First the ice cream .. The swirl looks big, but as i dig into it, turns out the swirl is hollow in the middle. A bit of a disappointment. As for the taste and texture, it's the typical texture you get from those soft ice cream. It's creamy and rich and there is definitely matcha flavor. But I found the bitterness in the matcha flavour a bit too strong for my personal preference. As for the mochi in there, it's not the chewy texture that I expected. I don't know how to describe it exactly, it has more of the hard-jello-like texture rather than the soft-chewy texture that I normally had previously. I am not a mochi expert, so not sure if there are various kind of mochi that is suppose to be this way, but i do prefer the chewy kind. As for the red bean paste, it taste like normal red bean, the typical red bean taste. :) and it goes well with the ice cream. For $6.75 (inc tax) if I remember correctly, the whole experience is a positive one. I guess I will also try the black sesame flavor next time and see if it's any good.  
 
As for the Matcha latte, it's $5.95, so you do get a big cup of latter. It's comparable to the Grande size from Starbucks. To be honest, its not bad but nothing particular good that I can mention either, a normal cup of Matcha latte.

The staffs are polite and the place is tidy and clean, so I will visit this place again for something else I haven't tried before from the menu."}
{"text":"Had the swirl softserv (matcha and black sesame) ($4.50 in a cup, or $5.50 in a cone). 

It may be the best softserv I've had yet!! Consistency of the ice cream was sooooooo smooth and thick. The flavours were awesome too. The matcha REALLY tasted of matcha, to the point that I found it a bit bitter. But I enjoyed the flavour punch for sure. The black sesame was amazing - I may just order a full cup/cone of that one next time. 

Mmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Tendou is the spot to grab Matcha Softserve in Markham. I come here quiet frequently and no other place can really compare in terms of the quality unless you want to trek all the way to Toronto.

Food: Can't go wrong in grabbing a swerve of Matcha or Black Sesame Softserve. Note: it would be great if they had woffles as an option for the cone. 

They have selection of matcha infused drinks and also an assortment of cakes offered as well, however I would say the main draw will still have to be the Ice cream.

Service: Staff is friendly and efficient. It's a grab and go type of establishment so I can't really say much about service other than the fact that no one ever makes me feel unwelcomed.

Atmosphere: Good Vibes, place is clean and makes a good chill spot to just sit down and have a conversation.

Recommendation: Yes! It's worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Came in here tonight with my boyfriend and our friends for their matcha ice cream. I got the matcha green tea and our friends got the swirl. It contained black sesame and matcha mixed together. Very dense ice cream and it's a bang for your buck..well 5bucks. There was so much ice cream in our cones that we struggled to finish it all.

Would definitely come back here for matcha green tea as the flavour was delicious and tasted so good! And would like to try the swirl as the black sesame also tasted very good!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the matcha soft serve I ordered.  I have high standard of matcha soft serve after having some legit ones in Asia and Tendou is pretty disappointing.  Matcha flavour is lacking."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the black sesame and matcha swirl soft serve. The matcha flavour is a bit bland on its own but it's simply delicious with the black sesame!"}
{"text":"New place in the corner Plaza of warden and hwy 7. Specializing mostly in matcha.  The store alone is quite small and I wouldn't say it is a sit down and have a conversation with friends environment.  Seemed more like a pick up and go (which is what we did) my fiance ordered the sesame soft serve with waffle cone, while mostly the rest of us ordered the mix (sesame and matcha softserve) in a cup. Prices are fair... the mix in a cup was 5$ while the mix in a cone was 5.50. The sesame in a cone I believe was also 5$

The flavour was sooo amazing. The sesame icecream had the taste of real sesame.. you can taste the graineyiness (if that's even a word) of the ground up sesame. It was not overly sweet and the cone made you wanting more and more! The matcha was flavourful and tasted very authentic unlike the green tea icecream you can get at a grocery store. The waffle cone was also quite crisp and enjoyable because I think they make it here as well.

Definitely will return but they only take cash or debit!"}
{"text":"Strong matcha taste? I think not. This is a Chinese owned rip off of Uncle Tetsu and also a rip off of Tsujiri that opened a few months ago. When they first opened they had limited selections similar to Uncle Tetsu. After Tsujiri opened they soon started copying their sundaes and even tried to do some pastries. Tendou is also not a brand from japan. They are not experts at matcha and their copy cat strategy shows.

We tried several items to share. The so called shiratama are just Chinese rice balls. The matcha ice cream is not bad but definitely not as good as Tsujiri. I don't understand how so many people think this place has better matcha. The flavor is a little weaker, like your Hime green tea ice cream but in soft serve. I definitely don't think they import the same grade of matcha as Tsujiri. The black sesame ice cream is too grainy. I like my ice cream creamy, not sandy.

If you get their matcha drinks, it's obviously a different grade of matcha. The frapps at this place are more like the Chatime Matcha Smoothies. If you try matcha drinks in Japan or even at Tsujiri, it's a much richer color. 

A copy cat can never be as good as the original. The price is not worth it for the quality. And they definitely don't offer the level of service that a Japanese ran place can provide."}
{"text":"The Black Sesame and Matcha Swirl Soft Serve came in a cup (or you can ask for it in a cone) and looked so good!  For $4.50, it's fairly decent considering what most places serve for matcha and black sesame soft serve nowadays.  The Matcha Soft Serve was rich and slightly bitter; what authentic matcha should be like!  It was a little thick too and rich.  The Black Sesame Soft Serve was the same way; rich and authentically black sesame taste.  Yum!  I think the machine didn't even distribute the black sesame soft serve evenly though because there was more matcha ice cream than black sesame in our cup.  The table next to ours had a more even distribution."}
{"text":"Second time going back to this place for dessert. Loved the kinako azuki swirl. It's delicious"}
{"text":"Their black sesame ice cream is really good! I definitely prefer that over the matcha. I feel like the matcha is a little too bitter for me, but to each their own.  I have tried the swirl and it was good, but I just didn't like the matcha ice cream by itself. I just feel that the black sesame ice cream has a similar taste to black sesame dessert soup and it really has a nice sesame flavour. Both matcha and black sesame have very strong flavours. Also, I've only gotten my ice cream in cups so I can't speak for the quality of the waffle cones. 
I tried the warabi mochi sundae and it was alright. Wasn't a big fan of the mochi (it was tasteless and had a jelly-like texture, which I personally did not like) but the red bean was good! The service is great and friendly! The place is really small and parking is a hassle but I've only gone during off-hours so I haven't experienced any slowness in service yet, although I do imagine that wait times can be quite long during peak hours due to the limited space. 
 I will be back to try other sundaes, drinks and maybe their other desserts as well! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for the black sesame froyo but found out that they only had houji cha.  The kid in the front was super nice and encouraged me to try all the flavors to see if I liked the houji cha.  It was delicious so I got a small cone in that.  Definitely worth trying!  The matcha was a little on the bitter side."}
{"text":"Love this place! When you have a craving for something sweet this is the place to go! Love their matcha green tea ice cream. The place gets full fast at night. A bit pricey but once in a while is OK. Especially since they serve soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Tendou Matcha & Dessert Cafe specializes in matcha soft serve. Tendou import the matcha  from Hoshino Tea Gardens all the way in Japan. It also serves other classic Japanese flavours like black sesame and toppings like red bean paste.

The soft serve and sundaes as well as smoothies and milkshakes are all tied together with the matcha theme. I went for a simple twist matcha and black sesame cone, because this is one of the few places that offers the matcha and black sesame twist cone. The matcha and black sesame twist combined to create a rich harmony of flavours.

I should also note that the pricing at Tendou is slightly lower than its competitors. I would highly recommend Tendou if you are in Markham."}
{"text":"This place is so dangerous for me because it's right by home. This is my favorite uptown go to place for matcha and black sesame soft serve. The matcha is strong and a bit bitter while the black sesame is rich and a bit sweet. I say it's a perfect match. I always tell myself I should come back and try other items on the menu but usually just end up with the same thing. It's also reasonably price. So you'll definitely see me here when i'm craving for the swirl!!"}
{"text":"Love love loveeeee this place!! One of the best matcha and black sesame ice cream stores I've ever tried! Their kinako azuki shiramata swirl is heavenly!! The combination of matcha and black sesame goes so well mixed with red bean with crushed almond powder. Their matcha frapp with red bean is also amazing, one of their best sellers. Only down side is their pricing, ranging from $5-7 per ice cream cone/cup. I've also noticed that with all their ice cream, it's actually hollow inside for both their cones and cups :/"}
{"text":"This place was quite easy to find and as I brought my friend with me the first thing she mentioned after I told her which plaza we were headed to was that she dreaded this plaza due to the parking. Um, there's underground parking! I told her and immediately she was no longer hesitant to go.
This place was quite small but if you're taking things to-go then it's okay.
I was initially disappointed by the lack of hot bevys they had so I went for one that the guy behind the counter suggested. I wish I could tell you what it was but I'm sure it had a Japanese name to it and it wasn't on the menu. I believe he said it was roasted green tea? Anyway, I was a little disappointed as it tasted very watered down. I thought, maybe I had to stir it. Nope. Boo.
BUT THEN. I ordered the green tea/black sesame twist soft serve and everything was all better. Personally, I found the green tea very strong on it's own. But when paired with the black sesame, it was absolutely delicious. YUM! They had many different options for toppings along with your soft serve and noticed many people ordering them but I stuck with the basics first. 
Although I was disappointed by their hot bevy drink I ordered, their menu consisted of a lot of cold bevys that looked very tasty and I am defintely going to go back and try these (and maybe grab another twist soft serve while I'm there anyway)."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of anything matcha flavoured, so when I found out there was a new matcha ice cream place in Markham, I was super excited. The place isn't too big but spacious enough to sit down with a small group of friends or for two. They weren't very busy when I arrived, so ordering was nice and quick. 

I was lucky and came on a day when they were having a $2 promo for a small black sesame and matcha swirl cone. Off the bat, the black sesame is overpowers the matcha flavour. It wasn't until I finished most of the black sesame that the matcha flavour really started to shine through. The black sesame is pretty good, not too sweet or too heavy. The matcha is also light and not too sweet, it has a slight bitter taste but in a  good way! 

I wish I could taste the matcha flavour more through. The texture of the soft serve is not dense at all, more of a gelato texture, which I love! Very refreshing for a hot summer day. Would I crave this? Probably not. But I'd definitely come back to try the matcha soft serve by itself and some of the other desserts they offer!

Note: They ONLY accept cash and debit right now. Debit accepted for orders over $5."}
{"text":"Matcha ice cream without the line.

On my first visit, I tried the black sesame and my sister tried the matcha.
The black sesame is a little grainy but worked well with the strong flavour. The matcha was not sweet at all and you could taste the tea. Friends have told me that the match was a little on the bitter side but I quite like it. 

I did visit again during their grand opening. The $2 mini cone is the perfect after dinner snack. 
Looking forward to trying some of their other desserts and drinks. 

The parking there is not the greatest as there are a lot of restaurants in the same plaza, so be patient."}
{"text":"I LOVE their matcha/sesame cone! The flavours are perfectly balanced and not overtly sweet, which is my pet peeve. The sesame flavour is very nice and creamy. Same with the matcha. I haven't tried their other things but I would come back just for the cones!"}
{"text":"If you love the authentic taste of matcha or black sesame. This is the place to be. 

You have to order their matcha soft serve or the black sesame soft serve....or get it in a swirl (which is equally as good, but the black sesame flavour is a little stronger and overtakes your taste buds so you don't taste the matcha as strongly).

I tried their opera cake, and it was pretty sweet, but the owner does plate it very nicely.

One downside is that it is a little pricey. But, I always keep coming because that's how memorable and tasty their matcha soft serve is."}
{"text":"Reminded me of soft swerve in NYC. Very strong taste of matcha and green tea. The waffle cone was good too. Only thing was, it was too sweet for my palate."}
{"text":"Great service, good looking ice cream.

I had the Green Tea Matcha ice cream with Mochi Balls. The mochi balls complemented the ice cream very nicely; they were nice and chewy. Having been the Japan several times and getting a lot of grean tea soft-serve while there, I found Tendou's version lacking in grean tea flavour. Could defiantly kick it up a notch or two.

But overall still an enjoyable desert, without having to travel too far from Markham. Will come back on a hot summer day to try more treats!"}
{"text":"Hubby is not a fan of anything black sesame but does not mind the black sesame soft serve ice cream from here.

The wifey on the other hand, just absolutely loves it and this is the go-to place when ice cream is a must. A little on the sweeter side, very creamy and strong taste of black sesame.

Side note: place is tiny and not much seating area for hanging out. 

Have yet to try the matcha. Will update review when wifey has strength to veer away from the black sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"Mmmm, you won't be disappointed with Tendou's soft-serve ice-cream! I liked how the ice-cream was more dense than usual soft-serves (like the ones from McDonald's or ice cream trucks), and extremely creamy and smooth at the same time. I tried the matcha & black-sesame twist, and the combination was heavenly! The strong grainy black sesame taste was off-set by the slight bitterness of the matcha flavour, making neither too overpowering in this mixture.

For $5.50, you get a good amount of ice-cream, as it's filled to the very bottom of the cone. I would definitely come back to order the same thing again."}
{"text":"Stick with the soft serve and skip the cake. 

Their \"signature\" Opera cake was dry and lacking green tea flavour. 

Soft serve, both black sesame and green tea were enjoyable though I would prefer a slightly stronger green tea taste (similar to other places). A few of the Mochi balls were too hard (maybe old?) and I found the red bean to be overly sweet. 

Only accepts debit or cash."}
{"text":"Trying this place for a first time after friends' recommendation. This little dessert place is clean and got decent quiet mood to have a conversation with friends over some soft serve ice creams. 

Onto the soft serve ice cream. I got the green tea matcha and black sesame swirl soft serve ice cream and my friend got her fix of pure matcha, both in a cone. I tasted both the black sesame and green tea matcha flavours individually, which neither overpowered the other one. But personally I would prefer the black sesame on it's own. 

When we got here, it was relatively quiet and we also found a seat. So this place isn't bad."}
{"text":"We ordered the Warabi Moochi twist. The ice-cream swirl was great. Rich and creamy matcha and sesame flavour. But the red bean tasted like it was from a can in a paste consistency instead of beans and the moochi was so, so bland. It tasted like a goop of flour. I'd go back for the ice-cream but nothing else. Also, it wouldn't hurt to turn on the ac during a heat warning. The space was also a bit dirty with melted ice-cream on the floor."}
{"text":"Update: Came by to share a black sesame and a matcha soft serve (in waffle cones). The matcha is very strong and bitter which I did enjoy since I like tea flavoured food but warning for those who dont like bitter ice cream. They told us the black sesame soft serve tonight was apparently grittier than normal but we chose to go with it anyway and it tasted great to me. If I had to pick, black sesame wins over matcha all the way. Lack of comfy seats!

---

Five stars for the black sesame soft serve. Reminds me of the (much better than here) 7/11 everywhere in Japan serving the most awesome varieties of soft serve ice cream including black sesame. I would say its even better as there is a real sesame taste while still being creamy. 

Service was good, the guy asked if we wanted to try a sample of the hokkaido milk when we wondered what that flavour of milkshake would taste like. Not enough seats. Would be hard to stand outside when cold, but we didnt need to line up at all as we came an hour before they closed.

Will be back to try the matcha flavour... that is if I can resist the black sesame!"}
{"text":"When Tendou just opened, I went to try their matcha lemonade and was a bit confused as to whether I liked it or not. The taste of matcha was very light, and then you would taste the slightest bit of lemony sourness. It didnt taste bad, but I dont think I would get it again.

Their red bean frappe was decent, but the black sesme/ matcha one was a bit of a disappointment. I also tried their twirl ice cream. Loved the black sesame flavour, but a bit overpowering and didnt live up to the hype in my opinion. Flavours were good, but not amazing to me.

I really liked their newly added matcha opera cake though! Good matcha flavour with the perfect sweetness and chocolate (coming from someone thats not a fan of chocolate). The textures were great, with a crunchy layer inside. That being said, it coming up to almost $10 is a bit too expensive for me."}
{"text":"I was here for an after dinner treat. We had the soft serve twist - matcha with black seasame along with two fruits...strawberry and blueberries and some glass jelly and red bean. I couldn't really taste the matcha. However, we did find that it taste better once your started mixing everything together. They also served small slices of cake such as chocolate sponge, matcha opera and black and white sesame. We didn't try it but they all looked really good. They only take cash or debit (over $5). Parking can be hard to find depending what time of the day or week you come because it's located in a fairly busy residential/commercial area."}
{"text":"I tried their matcha black sesame swirl and it was good!! I must say the ice cream was really big!! I was super full after eating it."}
{"text":"One time I came here 3 days in a row because it was that good. I love tendou and I'm actually going again this week now that summer is finally here. I recommend getting just the matcha or matcha swirl with sesame on a cone (it melts real quick though cus it's soft serve). Don't get the stuff with the toppings they tasted super artificial and you don't get to truly appreciate the matcha flavour."}
{"text":"The matcha soft serve is really strong matcha flavour (a bit too strong) and the sesame has strong flavour too but too sweet. However they are best twist together! Love the mochi in the sundaes."}
{"text":"lucky me- no line up and everything was in stock (yay)

The cashier was really helpful. Although there's not much on the menu for ice cream. you just pick the ice cream flavors; matcha, black sesame or both and then the 3 or 4 set toppings. 

I ordered a mix but the matcha was really overpowering so i suggest ordering the ice cream flavors individually.

I personally enjoyed it more than tsujiri. 

& there's limited seatings! so its best to just take out and sit on the sidewalk"}
{"text":"Yay for a great place to find amazing black sesame ice cream!!!~ 
It's difficult to find soft serve version. I'm a huge fan of this black sesame icecream with waffle cone!!!~ It has a good strong black sesame flavour (not sweet like the supermarket boxed version of ice cream). 
Usually after dinner time, we often find a line up in this small joint. It has enough seats in there to fit 2 tables of 4, another table for 2, and row of single seats along the wall. Not a great place to sit and eat ice cream if this place is full. 

I also tried their matcha --- NOT A FAN. it is far too bitter for my liking. It left a bad after taste instead of just green tea flavour. 

However, once you mix the blacksesame + matcha swirl together, this combo is GREAT! You can't feel the intensity of the green tea bitterness and if some people doesn't like the sweetness of the black sesame, this twist seems to bring it down a little. GREAt GREAT COMBO!!! Again, love the waffle

I would recommend!! I didn't deduct any stars for their lack of seating because the ice cream makes up for it!"}
{"text":"They specialized in the matcha powder yet i found it too bitter for my taste, it didnt go very well with the fruit and sesame ice cream at all. The premium tea tasted okay, not so bad but left no impression. The decoration and the space were blank and cold. It wasnt extremely bad experience but I wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. The flavours aren't extraordinary , not much difference from what you buy from the super market in a huge tub, Yes this is soft serve but , its definitely not worth the money you're paying for. Just because they make it look nice with the two flavoured swirl effect. Meh. Would I come back? Probably not. Tried it once and that's enough."}
{"text":"I must say this is probably one of the best soft serves in Markham! I tried the green tea and sesame twist. The flavour was extremely rich. Definitely was not bland. They also carry ice cream with different toppings ie: red bean, dumplings. They also have a variety of drink selection. I would recommend going later as often there is long line ups. There is not much seating area there, you most likely will have to eat your dessert outside. Will be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"They should change their name to Tendou Black Sesame & Dessert.

Pros:
1) Black Sesame soft serve on a waffle cone is lit.  It's the only thing worth going here for.

Cons:
1) They ALWAYS run out of the Black Sesame soft serve.
2) They don't accept credit.
3) They had the \"Drinks are $1.00\" sign up, and I had to ask the cashier for the discount.
4) The Kurogama (black sesame) frappe wasn't that great. It was pretty watered down and took a while to make."}
{"text":"Tendou is located in the Green Grotto, St. Louis Plaza in the South West corner on Highway 7 and Warden (right beside Hilton Hotel)!

I came here twice, although there weren't a ton of seats, the service was awesome and quite fast. They have 15 main items with their green tea and black sesame soft serve specialty and quite a few others items listed on the side (e.g. creme brulee). 

I personally am not a big fan of Black Sesame, but the people working there gave me a great tip before I ordered and let me know that the Black Sesame is sweeter and the green tea along was quite bitter, so I decided to go with the twist option in a cone ($5.50). I'm super glad I went with this option, because trying the green tea alone, it was indeed quite bitter. The ice cream looked really delicious to eat, but tasting it, the texture of the ice cream was indeed soft serve and tasty, but it wasn't anything SUPER special to me. Something I think was mixing in the texture is the creaminess of the soft serve (not sure if it's compatible with the matcha and black sesame), though I did taste more creaminess in the black sesame than the matcha. Also, I really wonder if the matcha can be made in a way where it's not bitter and yet still tastes good - I also found this a problem with one of the green tea softserves in Downttown Toronto. 

The second time I came, I tried the Kinako Azuki Shiratama soft serve mix for $7. This included sprinkled brown sugar, red bean and mochi. I liked the touch of brown sugar, felt indifferent about the red bean option, and was quite disappointed with the mochi. The mochi wasn't super soft and it didn't have a filling. Added in into the ice cream, it tasted like a blob of white flour with no taste and is slightly sticky for the texture of the mochi. I think if they did smaller pieces of mochi, it would be much better. In addition, maybe a little more icing sugar wrapped around the smaller pieces of mochi would have helped."}
{"text":"Black sesame soft serve is definitely the best in my opinion! If you enjoy matcha soft serve, be prepared to be blown away by the bittersweet-ness of it!

The place is pretty small and parking could be slightly difficult depending on the time you visit."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm tried their matcha / black sesame swirl soft serve on a cone. Delish :)!! So thick and creamy :) matcha and black sesame both had some serious flavours. I will be back to try their black sesame frappe. :)! Excited for this new addition nearby ! Taking one star off because they only take cash and debit ... Hopefully that changes in the future !!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try the matcha and black sesame soft serve swirl today, but was disappointed to find out they were out of the black sesame soft serve today (and as per another Yelper, they are always out of the black sesame so I kinda expected that), but I still wanted to try the matcha soft serve anyway so I just ended up getting that.

For $4.50 you get an OK sized amount of ice cream (hollow centre). The taste of the matcha is strong, but over-all it tasted A-OK. Ice cream melts pretty fast too, barely had time to take a picture.

Was worth a one-time try. Maybe sooner than later they would have the black sesame soft serve for me to try.

{"text":"I had the matcha milk tea as well as the black sesame matcha twist cone. The milk tea was underwhelming compared to others that I have tried. The matcha taste in the green tea was not very strong.  It was more milk than matcha green tea 

As for the cone, I enjoyed the black sesame very much and would recommend this one to have."}
{"text":"Went there for the matcha swirl ice cream. To my surprise, it was delicious that I finished it since it was huge. The flavour was not too sweet with the perfect hint of matcha. I will definitely be back to try their frappes?"}
{"text":"I remember going there for the first time just to try their matcha ice cream. It was so good but a little too bitter to my likings. However, I've fallen in love with their matcha cream puffs and Hokkaido milkshake. Soooooo good. The place is pretty small with decent decors. I would suggest the matcha creeps to go and enjoy life but if you're not into matcha, the Hokkaido milkshake can also make your day so much better."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday night. The menu is kinda confusing. We notice people are having hard time to order the stuff from the menu because they do not put the number beside each dessert!

The ice cream melts really fast for some reasons. The sticky rice balls have no taste at all and we feel it's over cooked.
We sit inside the store, the space is really tight.

Overall we try it just because it's new. But we probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"Went here today check out the matcha and black sesame soft serve and it was delicious!  Even better was their promo, $2 for a small cone which ended up to be bigger than we expected. It was a twist of the two flavours in a sugar cone. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because I thought the sugar cone tasted a bit stale and it leaked. All of our cones leaked and we ate the ice cream indoors in an air-conditioned climate.  Also our son kept complaining about how he couldn't breathe in the air due to a foul odour.  There was a different smell but I couldn't quite pinpoint what it was. He ate his ice cream with his nose pinched. 

Would like to try the other desserts they have there though!  There were various cakes and crème brûlée on the board too."}
{"text":"I'd heard wonderful things about this place. What a letdown.

There are brief menu headings, but most of the menu items are just pictures. That being said, the desserts better look like the pictures, because that's the only thing I have to go by. The pictures look bigger than their desserts are in reality. 

We got one of their fruit shiratama anmitsu desserts. There were fruits in the picture that were supposed to be in our dessert, but they were just completely omitted. We weren't told anything either. They just made our dessert. When we asked about it, they just said, \"Oh. Those pictures were taken a long time ago.\" Well, if they were, why don't you update your menu? The picture showed 4-5 fruits. We got two. One of them was supposed to be blueberry. Even that got subbed out for blackberry. Basically, they charged me for a more expensive dessert and gave me a cheaper one. They also didn't give me a receipt. To top off our experience, our dessert was not particularly impressive tasting, which means the entire thing was just an overpriced rip-off."}
{"text":"Hubby and I found ourselves back here for the second time in 8 days as he was eager to try the black sesame frappe. This is not overly sweet, refreshing, slightly milky, with a definite taste of black sesame. I liked the addition of red bean topping, which added richness and texture to the drink. 

Tonight they featured a matcha opera cake, which has layers of matcha sponge, milk chocolate ganache, matcha ganache, and buttercream. The labor of love was obvious in the artful plating of this dessert. I liked that the matcha flavour was present in a sweeter form through the cake and ganache, and the cake had a nice denseness to it. 

I look forward to trying more desserts, including the mochi waffle, as well as tasting my way through the other matcha beverages on the menu.

{"text":"TL;DR: A really good choice if you're looking for black sesame ice cream. They mainly have two flavors (black sesame and matcha) and have a bunch of items that are derivatives of these. Some items includes ice cream, drinks, etc. The place is quite small, and will fit around 5 small groups at most. I highly recommend their black sesame ice cream since it's not very sweet or strong. 

Food (4/5): 

They have two main ice cream flavors: black sesame and matcha. I personally enjoy the black sesame ice cream more, and it's also probably one of the best ones around the area. Their matcha ice cream is good, but it isn't as flavorful as it could be. Also, I wouldn't really recommend the swirl (mix of both flavors) because the black sesame will easily overpower the flavor of the matcha. I've also tried their Hokkaidou milk tea, and I wouldn't mind order that again. I would say the price is average for what you get.

Space (3.5/5):

The place is a bit small and will only fit around 5 small groups. If you're coming here right after lunch from around the area, be prepared to eat your ice cream somewhere else. Lighting is also a bit dark at night, so if you're only here for that instagram photo, come during the day.

-----------
Overall (3.5 - 4/5)"}
{"text":"Soft serve wasn't as smooth as I'd like. Green tea was more flavorful than black sesame. Black sesame was a bit bland. The mochi and jelly on the bottom of the ice cream cause the ice cream to melt quickly and everything became soggy. Lots of mochi and ice cream compared to other places and price is slightly cheaper. Red bean paste is a must."}
{"text":"I prefer another matcha store that's in downtown. I enjoyed their matcha ice cream and sesame ice cream but the intensity of the flavours aren't enough. 

The mochi was not the greatest either...

It's not anymore so I'm not sure if they closed down or just renovating"}
{"text":"Tastes great, huge serving if you get it in a cone. Goes all the way down to the bottom of the cone then they pile it up really high. Price is reasonable ($5 a cone)."}
{"text":"A little pricey but you are getting your money's worth with the desserts. Everything is prepared that morning and you can taste how fresh it is. Great place for some interesting sweets."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to hear that there was a new Japanese dessert place in Markham and the soft serve ice cream definitely does not disappoint here at tendou. It's perfect for cooling off from the summer heat. With an expanded menu coming, tendou has seriously potential. Just a heads up that there is a white-board menu near the magazine shelf, it's easy to miss.

I've had both the black sesame and matcha soft serves and loved them both. This is some good ice cream. I don't know if it's supposed to be that chunky, but I really enjoyed it like that; the ice cream is heavy and dense. Kind of ironic its called soft-serve but I'm no ice cream expert. All I know was that it was good ice cream. The matcha is heavy in flavour and is tad bitter in a good way. The cones were absolutely packed with ice cream to the last bite, which is awesome because it isn't a small cone either! 

The value is fair, as you could do a lot worse for ice cream. It's $4.00 for the cup or $5.00 for the cone. You'll have to pay $0.50 more for a combination swirl which is a bit puzzling. 

The place is quite small with only a few tables, and the first time I came here we just went outside and enjoyed our ice cream outside. The second time we managed to get a table, they also have those cute Japanese magazines to browse at. Service could be a bit better but I'll cut them slack since its only a soft opening. It took forever to get ice cream the first time. I'll be back for many more times, especially to try their drinks."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places I know of that serves black sesame soft serve ice cream. 
I got the green tea matcha, black sesame swirl reg cone ($6.20). the black sesame does not overpower the matcha but i also think maybe they dont really do well together? One is bitter while the other is creamy. Since both are kind of premium flavors and the machine has limited optioms, i get why this is how it is."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night after dinner, it wasn't too busy. They had a very small seating area where you could sit and talk I came here with 3 other people. I've been nagging my boyfriend for the past 2 years to take me to a green tea soft serve ice cream place. So I built up really high expectations for myself. My friends they all had the sesame ice cream cone and I ordered the matcha cup. My friends got their ice cream before me so by the time I got my beautifully arranged cup they were finished their cones :(. I had a lick off my boyfriends cone and the sesame flavour was so delicious! The matcha for me was a little stronger tasting then what I'm use to so it was a little bitter for me. 

The green tea cup I had included: 3 mochis, an arrange of fruits, a scoop of red bead. 

All in all it was a decent first experience for green tea soft serve."}
{"text":"A lot of Asian dessert places have been popping up in Markham and a lot are getting tons of hype. This is one of those places. 

I came today, a Sunday night, and ordered the matcha and black sesame swirl soft serve in a cone. Service was super quick. 

The black sesame had a really nice, sweet, almost nutty taste. Super delicious. The matcha helped even the sweetness out so it wouldn't be too strong. 

Overall it was really good but the $6 price tag makes its value questionable. 4/5"}
{"text":"When I went the green tea machine was down so my only choice was black sesame. I got the sundae with fruit and red bean paste and mochi. The ice cream itself was good, smooth and strong in flavour with a good amount of toppings, love the textures of the tangy fruit, earthy beans and the chewy mochi. 

However, the service was extremely slow it took almost 15 minutes to make and there was a pretty long line. The shop was small so there was no seating left, but that's not a huge problem when its nice outside. The worst part was that there was an overwhelming bathroom smell in the air that wasn't pleasant..."}
{"text":"Came here during their soft opening, on a random late Tuesday night. Upon entering, we were greeted and they explained what was being offered during their soft opening. Very friendly and courteous :) 

Boyfriend and I ordered a Matcha/vanilla twist soft serve cone and their Black Sesame frappe (Kurogoma Frappe on their menu). 

Matcha soft serve verdict: LOVED the strong matcha flavour and the slight graininess of the matcha added a nice texture to the creamy soft serve. Since I tried it as a twist cone with vanilla, I definitely want to get just a matcha next time! 

Black Sesame Frappe: It had a nice black sesame flavour and the added bonus that it wasn't too sweet (typically Chinese people don't like their desserts or drinks too sweet so this was perfect)!! 

I will definitely be back to Tendou in the near future... I NEED their black sesame soft serve in my life! (updates to come when I do go and try :P)"}
{"text":"Tendou, the new go-to matcha ice cream place in town. Some people may like it some people may not, mainly because of the strong matcha flavour in their ice cream.  I came here twice already and on my two visits, I got the plain matcha ice cream and also tried the swirl which is half matcha and half black sesame.

For people that do not like their matcha too bitter, go with the swirl, otherwise I recommend eating the matcha by itself.  Drink wise, I tried the Matcha Lemonade and i find it quite disappointing.  The Matcha Lemonade had very weak matcha aftertaste and I didn't taste much lemonade either.  My recommendation is to stick to their ice cream if you do visit this place."}
{"text":"This is my third time at Tendou, and it has become a solid spot for my green tea fix. 

1) Matcha & Sesame twist- the matcha reminded me of the ice-cream from Hime, except it's more creamy w/ a hint of bitterness. The sesame part had intense flavors as well, but it's grainier due to the ground up seeds. I would get them separately since the sesame can overpower the matcha. 

2) Hokkaido Milk frappe- I loved this one. The drink was very creamy, yet light & refreshing. The strong taste of Hokkaido milk also permeates through. Highly recommend. 

3) Kurogama frappe- this was basically a diluted version of black sesame soup (???) w/ ice. It was quite gritty and the flavor wasn't as concentrated as the sesame ice-cream. I doubt I'll get it again.

4) Matcha Shiratama Anmitsu- this is a new item since their grand opening. It had matcha soft serve along w/ mochi balls, red bean, and jelly. Presentation looks great, but I'm not a fan of the toppings. The mochi balls were plain Chinese rice balls (??), and the red bean & jelly were just average. I would rather get a simple matcha cone at a lower price."}
{"text":"Delicious green tea and black sesame twirl soft serve ice cream. Must try! Located on Highway 7 and warden, small dessert shop with ice cream and bubble tea/ various cold drinks. The shop had a few tables for dining in but there are also benches located outside the shop that allows people to eat their ice cream outdoors. The ice cream cones are mostly $5."}
{"text":"Just tried the matcha soft serve in a waffle cone here for $5.65 after taxes. I really enjoyed it. I thought it had just the right matcha flavor and was nice and creamy. The fact that it comes in a waffle cone is a plus. Waffle cones should be the only kind of cone that ice cream comes in. 

My only complaint about the soft serve is that the cone does not get filled well. There was a hole in the middle of my ice cream that should have been filled with more matcha deliciousness instead of a gaping hole of sadness. Other than that everything was good. 

The employee working there seemed friendly and greeted me when I walked in. 

There are only a few tables inside so the place isn't well suited for large groups. 

I want to come back for sure to try the black sesame soft serve and the black sesame frappe."}
{"text":"??app????????????DOWNTOWN?????markham????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????+??????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Cost $5 for a very small portion. We asked for the swirl matcha and black sesame in a cup. It came hallow in the middle making it look like more then it was. The flavour of the matcha wasn't great, had much better at other places. The black sesame was okay. Worse part is the price to portion ratio. Not happy. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Coming here on their opening weekend, there was quite the line-up.  Tendou is a new dessert place that opened up in the same plaza as Green Grotta, across from the Hilton hotel in Markham. 
The venue (aside from being crowded) has a lot of Asian-inspired desserts; Green tea matcha.

Warabi Mochi 3.5/5 Me being a green tea match fan, this was my favorite, served with sliced bananas, black berries, blue berries and strawberries.  Presentation was bang on and the mochi's in this dessert made this a fun eat!

Black Sesame 2.5/5 This dessert option was out of my comfort zone but nonetheless a treat to try. Same dessert condiments (fruits) as mentioned below. The black sesame was missing an ingredient as it tasted bland in my opinion, perhaps a sweeter version would enhance the taste of the black sesame. 

if you're not a fan of ice cream, they've got a lot of drink options! hence I'll need to come back to try this place again!  Some of the wait time for the folks in our group took longer than normal.. but again its opening weekend with a massive line-up, go figure."}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect when the only two flavours are match and black sesame... my best friend ( Jose) told me to trust him and that I would love it... 
The only negative thing about this place is that it it closed on a Monday lol
Great soft serve ice cream!!! I love getting the swirl! It's amazing on a nice summer day. If you are thrown off by \"black sesame\" be open minded and I guarantee you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE TENDOU. If you like matcha, you will love this place. So far, I have tried their matcha softserve, black sesame softserve and Matcha Au Lait Frappe - and everything was delicious. My favourite is definitely their black sesame softserve - best in Toronto I would say. The black sesame flavour is very strong and smooth. So good! Their matcha drinks and matcha icecream is great as well. I was told that they will be having more matcha desserts rolling out in the near future - definitely something to watch out for! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Saw so many people post their delicious cone(s) and frappes on facebook, social media, don't you just love it. Other people just keep snapchatting and posting online pics, you don't even have to market yourselves!! Lol..

I was interested in getting the black sesame cone but they said due to technical difficulties that day, it wasn't possible to get that...booo...so we only could have Matcha....I tried to Kurogama Frappe as recommended by Jennifer K. and that was pretty good...black sesame taste was strong...

Matcha softserve was creamy and strong matcha taste..I believe this is a new-ish restaurant as I didn't see it here before...there are approximately 10-15 seats maximum so its not recommended for seating in for groups...

Matcha is really something thats a hit or miss for lot of people, you either love it or you don't. There sure are health benefits of Matcha as it's been part of the Japanese culture for decades...

Some benefits of Matcha :

Packed with antioxidants including the powerful EGCg
Boosts metabolism and burns calories
Detoxifies effectively and naturally
Calms the mind and relaxes the body
Is rich in fiber, chlorophyll and vitamins
Enhances mood and aids in concentration
Provides vitamin C, selenium, chromium, zinc and magnesium
Prevents disease
Lowers cholesterol and blood sugar

All in all, an A-Ok place where I may come back for sesame soft serve..."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations for this place because of the hype. I wanted to go here so badly for so long, but only got the chance to recently because they're closed on the only day I'm usually free.

The green tea soft serve was pretty good, but I actually preferred my brother's black sesame and green tea swirl one a lot more. I felt like I had had enough of the green tea after a few bites, and by the time I reached the waffle cone, I felt kind of sick of it. It was a pretty big portion of ice cream!

The sesame had a really nice rich roasted sesame flavour. Next time I go back I'm probably just going to have the sesame, or the swirl--- and not in a waffle cone."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place after a long time after I wanted to come here. Nothing spectacular or mind blowing about it.

This place serves average matcha and sesame ice cream. It's not really soft serve but on the more thicker side. 

Prices are quite expensive if you want to get the icecreams with more toppings on it. Spending $13 on cream and sugar is actually quite ridiculous. The moochi inside was nothing spectacular. Just soft chewy balls.

The only way I'll come next time is if they  had the small cone on promotion.  It's  expensive ice cream. Enough said. I'll just be generous with the rating and say three."}
{"text":"Really great place if you're looking for that nutty black sesame and/or matvha flavored ice creams. I came here to just get a swirl cup, as I didn't want to mess the flavours with other toppings. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Environment:
A couple of seating area, but what caught my attention was how fancy the chairs and tables were. I thought I was sitting in someone's dining room rather than a cafe. A downside is that it can get a little crammed where people order and wait for their dessert with the seatings on the side. 

Service:
Not too bad. I was greeted upon walking in and was told about their promos, if any. 

Price & Product:
I had the matcha & black sesame swirl. Personally I'm not a fan of black sesame soft but I thought I'd give it a try 'cause from reading other's reviews, they said the matcha was slightly bitter and the sesame blended with it nicely. OMG IT WAS THE BEST THING EVER. I loved how strong the matcha tasted and the bitterness of it blended so well with the sweetness from the sesame. I prefer it over Wooffles! For $5.50 the cone was decently big but I wish they'd bring back the mini cone they had during their Grand Opening ($2 mini swirl). It was the perfect size for an evening snack. I plan to come back in the future to try the matcha opera cake and/or the waffle (I think it's made from mochi..?) dessert."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out Tendou! They were also having their grand opening $2 swirl come special too. We arrived at around 7pm after checking out the Rib Fest across the street at the civic centre and there was a line out the door. The store itself is pretty small with limited seating. They have a variety of drinks as well. We got 2 of their special swirl cone, which consisted of black sesame and matcha soft serve, as well as the regular match a soft serve in a cone. The matcha taste is strong, the way I like it, however the black sesame is on the lighter side. Still very good!"}
{"text":"If you MUST have matcha or sesame soft serve, I guess there aren't many options in the area but to come here for it.  Sesame in my opinion is tastier than the matcha, but it's definitely pricey.  It being relatively close to Costco, I would rather pick up a cone there instead."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to try it out. Ordered the Warabi Mochi Matcha Black Sesame Swirl Soft Serve. The black sesame side was actually stronger flavour than the Matcha side. But paired together wasn't bad either. I wasn't really fond of their warabi Mochi..it was a bit too soft & rubbery..some of the red bean were a little uncooked as well."}
{"text":"Speed read:
Matcha soft serve: Best in GTA
Strong flavor, not too sweet, fresh cone.

I tried the matcha soft serve on a cone.
For matcha lover, this is the strongest matcha flavor, and not too sweet. 

The sesame flavor is also good.  However, I still like the matcha flavor better.
I didn't like the twist as much, as I found the sesame overpowering."}
{"text":"The best thing a foodie can hear from a new business is that they have more menu options on the way! But before all that, let's get down to what you can see right here and now! 


Decor:: simple & casual. Not your typical paper-bamboo decor but a rather simplistic design. There are a few seats to sit and enjoy but mostly this would be a place to swing by for some delicious snacks and soft serve.

Service:: Super friendly and warm. There was only one person serving at the time but he was efficient and very patient (I ask a lot of questions when there is more food than belly space)

Soft serve:: This was the reason you're even reading right? It's delicious and you definitely get a LOT of matcha flavour! :) Happy faces all around! 

Tendou also has a great selection of green tea drinks from light and refreshing to rich and creamy. I tried the matcha au lait frappe and it was delicious but a bit too heavy for me :) 

Still lots of things to come according to the owner so I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I came here with very high expectations and have to say that I was a bit disappointed. There isn't a lot of seating and the place is pretty cramped, especially with people lining up. The store layout design isn't optimized in terms of the traffic flow. We were sitting against the wall and people waiting for their orders were literally standing right next to our table. 

Onto the food, my order was much smaller than my friends although we ordered the same type of dessert but with different sides/toppings. I felt that the presentation and taste were both mediocre. The mochi was especially disappointing for me as it did not taste like mochi at all- not the chewy and kind of stick texture you would expect. The texture was more like jello. I have definitely had better matcha soft serve else where (Woofles & Cream). 

On the bright side, I found the staff to be friendly."}
{"text":"The matcha soft serve was such a treat on a hot day. The waffle cone was a touch sweet but still enjoyable. The atmosphere is a bit dark but the ice cream definitely worth a second visit!"}
{"text":"The only reason they're getting 4 stars is because the Green tea and Black sesame swirl is a lethal combination to your taste buds.
 
I will be blunt about this one - do not get a cone. The waffle cone is from a Presidents Choice box on display. Just get a cup and avoid the mess ;)

The things they lack to potentially receive 5 stars:

1. Egg waffles. They would easily run Woofles and Cream out of business like a gazelle being bullied by a lion in Africa. Do not compare Woofles' mediocre matcha to Tendou's or you will have a bad time.

2. Different source of waffle cones. Self-explanatory.

3. New machines that don't break down. Black sesame goes out of stock very often, and this is their staple.

TL;DR - This spot is great for date finishers. I guarantee you great success if you take them here ;)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite soft serve place in the city. The matcha has matcha flavour; the black sesame flavor is strong - the best! If you get twist, the black sesame overpowers the matcha. The cone is good too. But eat it quick - it melts so fast!"}
{"text":"Just tried their green tea match and sesame soft serve. The green tea soft serve is good. It has the right amount of matcha flavour. However, it's not as smooth as soft serve should be. It tastes like they were not able to mix it well enough to make it smooth. I've had better matcha soft serve in Japan and this is sub-par compared to that but it's still pretty decent for what we have in Toronto. The black seasame ice cream was not smooth at all. The consistency was similar to watery sand that's been frozen (grainy) - no, this is not how soft serve is suppose to be. Also, it is not because it's \"homemade\" that it's like that.  When the fat content of ice cream is too high, and it gets mixed too much, the fat clumps together which make it grainy - this is called \"buttering out\". The black sesame soft serve here, suffers from that. By the end of my black sesame soft serve, I could chew the bits of fat that clumped together (doesn't sound good right?). Although the texture was not favourable, the flavour of their black sesame is better then most I've had in north america so far. Improvements are required (ie fix the clumping). I've noticed other yelp members have posted pictures of the matcha soft serve that also looked very grainy as well but today's match was pretty smooth so I'm pretty sure they can do that with the black sesame. I'm torn because the consistency needs work but the flavours are good."}
{"text":"My favorite place for dessert! I always get matcha/sesame swirl with fruit. It's delicious"}
{"text":"Perfect pairings just make sense - think about peanut butter & jelly, chips and salsa, and of course, black sesame and matcha.

Cones are 2 for $2 during Easter weekend. (Today is the last day!!) The \"mini\" size is a great portion for a post-lunch snack, or a late night treat. Anytime of day, really. Treat yo self.

TASTE: The sweetness of the black sesame nicely balances out the bitterness of the matcha. The soft serve is really good (doesn't melt right away like McDonald's :p) and isn't overbearingly sweet.

It's a cute little place and there wasn't a line (even with the awesome $2 special!) I've only ever ordered soft serve here but would be down to try other black sesame creations."}
{"text":"Just along highway 7 and warden. Located in a commercial building with other restaurants. If you're a fan of matcha you'll love this place. I would recommend getting the cold drinks there as the hot drinks were ok with me. I see there being competition with the Serissa bubble tea place."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend this past Saturday. Tendou is located in the same plaza as Gal's Sushi, so it makes for a good outing. I would say the two flavours sold here are very strong, but good taste wise. If you're not really into Matcha and/or Black Sesame ice cream, this place isn't for you, but if you are, this is a must try. It's somewhat small, with some seating, and my friend and I were fortunate enough to get the comfy seats! :) It can get busy, and they do run at times, so come early-ish if anything."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner and dessert for some more dessert :)

They have matcha, black sesame and swirl. I got the swirl in a cone, my friend she got black sesame in a cup. The black sesame was really good."}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews on yelp and had to try this place for myself. They also had a $2 mini-cone deal for the weekend. Ordered a swirl cup for myself and a mini-cone for my girlfriend because she wanted some cone too...

The ice cream is really good.. both the matcha and the black sesame were very flavourful. My girlfriend actually found the matcha flavour a little too strong, becoming a bit bitter, and preferred the black sesame. We'll most definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late night craving. I just ordered a mini twist of matcha and black sesame ice cream on a cone. The flavours were rich and ice cream had a nice consistency. I'd definitely come back !"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this place has opened and its consistently amazing. Once i was craving their ice cream and rushed there right before closing. As soon as i got the cone i was so happy, i skipped out of the store. THEN THE ICE-CREAM FELL OUT OF THE CONE AND RIGHT INFRONT OF THE CAR. My boyfriend was pretty annoyed and we went back in and they gave us a free cone to replace it! Their service is 5/5. 

you need to eat their black sesame icecream its amazing. Also you can add toppings on the side for $.50."}
{"text":"Extremely happy that a matcha soft serve has opened up in Markham. Their black sesame soft serve is actually better tasting than their matcha. Although, the swirl of the two is a perfect combination of sweet, bitter, and creamy. 

However, their Hokkaido milkshake was extremely milky and creamy. It tasted very much like drinking sweet milk. It would be perfect for those who enjoy this flavour and the consistency of the shake was solid."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Tendou that i felt that my review might be a bit bias. I felt that even before I entered the store, there was already such a high bar for them to meet. All of my friends have been raving about their match and black sesame soft serve and I for one, love matcha. 

So the Boyfriend and I stopped by after lunch at Gal's sushi. The entrance is weird, you actually have to enter the building and then be able to enter Tendou. We walked in, was automatically greeted by the cashier/employees. Their menu was easy to understand and straight-forward which included pictures for those who are confused, like myself. We got the Shiratama Anmitsu which is a Japanese Wagashi dessert made with agar agar jelly, fresh fruits of your choice, red bean paste and matcha ice cream. I had wanted a swirl of match and black sesame, however, they were promoting a roasted tea soft serve flavour in lieu of the black sesame. 

Price wise? i found it a little steep at $6.50 and we actually got the cheapest bowl soft serve. The cones range about $4-5 dollars depending if you want only one flavour or whether you want a swirl of both flavours.  However, i will say this. Their matcha is pretty on point. It's a little bitter and the fresh fruits that they used in our Shiratama Anmi7tsu was delicious! 

The place itself is kind of small. Not really great for big gatherings, perfect for a pair of friends meeting up for gossip/conversation. Depending what time of the week/day you go, parking can be easy peasy or hell. So beware! 

All in all, i will be back! Who knows, maybe i'll even visit this weekend!"}
{"text":"I bought a matcha lemonade.  It had a delicious, real matcha taste.  I was not sure if they used lemonade powder or real lemon juice.  If they used real lemon juice, it was very diluted."}
{"text":"They have really delicious soft serve here! The matcha and black sesame are both delicious separately, but the twist is absolutely amazing! Even though I'm not a huge fan of black sesame, I loved the soft serve. I definitely recommend this place to try!"}
{"text":"Matcha soft serve is so much better than Uncle Tetsu's! They didn't have black sesame soft servethat day :(

The boys behind the counter are chill, didn't get my order right the first time. They probably pick up a lot girls there with that gig, oh lucky boys, but they also have a fan of mature young moms there too. Haha. Good for you!

keep my matcha orders yummy as usual please! that's all i ask."}
{"text":"We got their 2 dollar mini cones, one matcha, one swirl, one black sesame. Honestly, I liked their black sesame the best. 

To start off with their signature item, the matcha! Reallly really creamy which makes it very good and easy to get through. However it's full of matcha flavour which is good or bad depending on who you speak to. It's not like that fake Starbucks matcha that people are used to and you can taste the slight bitterness from it. I personally love it! 

Secondly, the swirl, really great the black sesame toned down the bitterness and just in general I really loved how the flavours complimented each other. 

The black sesame I just haven't had such creamy black sesame before! Such a win in my opinion!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is terrific! Black sesame is my personal preference. Have it how you want - in a cone, in a cup, or decked out with fruit and mochi. Haven't tried the drinks yet, so can't comment on that. Wish they had more seating though. FYI parking lot can get quite busy on weekends. They also do not take credit card."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place is much better Tsujiri and there was barely any wait on a Saturday. We got the ice cream bowls. The Matcha flavour were strong, you can really taste the matcha, and the sesame ice cream was really flavourful. Definitely one of the better sesame ice cream in Markham. However, there were very limited seating. We didn't even end up getting a spot after standing there awkwardly for 10 minutes. There's definitely a better way of arranging the tables so that they can accommodate more people."}
{"text":"There's been quite an influx of Asian dessert places, notably ice cream and gelato in the past few years. Tendou is one that has found quite a bit of a popular following.

Tendou is a little hard to find if you're not looking for it. It's in the plaza with St. Louis, Gal's Sushi, and Serissa and faces the parking lot (not facing Highway 7). You have to actually walk into the building - you can't walk in from the storefront.

Inside is pretty small so maybe don't expect to sit there. Tendou has black sesame and matcha soft serve in a variety of combinations, with pricing based on what kind of mix you get (some have fruit, mochi, red bean, etc.) and whether you'd like just one flavor or a twist. These are around 7 ish dollars and a bit pricey for my taste. You can just get soft serve for cheaper and there are mini cones even for really cheap (like 2.50/3 dollars).

That being said, it's good. I got the shiratama anmitsu (mochi, strawberries/blueberries, agar jelly, red bean) and it was a refreshing dessert. However, I found their soft serve on the icier side and I definitely prefer my ice cream creamier and softer (like Wooffles and Cream). The matcha taste is stronger and less sweet than Wooffles though if that's what you prefer. In terms of matcha strength it'd probably go from Wooffles - Tendou - Tsujiri. 

We also tried a tofu cheesecake. Delicious and I wasn't expecting it to be so good. The only problem is it's about 6-7 dollars for a tiny, tiny portion. TINY. You'll see what I mean when you get there.

So 3 stars or 3.5. Tendou is good but I think there is better out there and for a better price."}
{"text":"Amazing match a desserts and ice cream.  The combo of match and black sesame soft serve is great.  However, I think their daifuku dessert might be the best thing I have had there!  A mochi like exterior filled with a green tea cream and red bean core.  Incredible!"}
{"text":"Tried the soft serve matcha ice cream for $4.50 
Tastes okay. Nice flavour and texture. A few spots for seating inside. Service is fast and friendly. I think they could have more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Tendou is a nice dessert place after a meal, but I'd recommend bringing friends because the portions are large. The green tea and black sesame soft serve twist was nice, but I was recommended to try the green tea and black sesame separately, so I'll definitely do that next time! Beware though, seating isn't ample."}
{"text":"Great icecream, has a stronger MAtcha flavour though. If you are not into that bitterness, you might not be a fan."}
{"text":"Tendou is a new matcha Cafe that opened not too long ago, and I personally think it's a bit overrelated. I got the matcha and sesame swirl, and it was pretty much mediocre. I also did not enjoy the matcha genmaicha unfortunately. I don't think I will be back, but the idea of a matcha Cafe certainly is fresh and clever."}
{"text":"Came to tendou to try out their matcha soft serve. Unfortunately they only have limited servings.  I got there around 9 on a Sunday and they already put out the sign for no ice cream. 
Alternatively, we ordered the matcha cream puff, matcha creme brule and matcha milk tea. I would definitely come back for the exact same orders. The matcha was noticeable but not overpowering. The milk tea I would say is the best matcha milk tea I've had."}
{"text":"Soft serve all day every day! Would definitely just eat black sesame for life... ok maybe not haha. I have yet to try their drinks as I always.. always get the icecream. The service though however... Is not as great since there always seems to be about 2 people serving a million people outside. So you can definitely expect a big line. Other then that avoid busy nights and you should be good to eat some amazing soft serve icecream!"}
{"text":"I'm probably not a great person to rate ice cream because I'm not a super huge fan (#dodgesbulletsnow).  But I did try their matcha soft serve and it was okay.  I was really hoping to find a place in Ontario that would give me an ice cream rich in matcha flavor and unfortunately, I still haven't found that.  Their daifukus are pretty good but it's just not creamy enough on the inside again.  

Overall, it's an okay place to go to for desserts."}
{"text":"Came on a weekend to try the green tea and sesame soft serve and sesame milk tea? The ice cream was good nothing amazing the drink....lets just say I won't order anymore. Taste in the drink was quite bland and just tasted like sesame mixed with water..parking can be quite hard to find in the plaza. Overall all most likely won't go Back just for soft serve"}
{"text":"The ice cream here is terrible, I wouldn't go here again. Tastes very grainy and lack of flavour."}
{"text":"I really like this matcha and black sesame ice cream.but I just think for what the amount  they charge it's a bit to much. The green tea and black sesame had a very interesting combination to it very creamy texture and not to sweet it's pretty addicting. If they lowered the price i would definitely come back"}
{"text":"$2 mini cone was pretty good and hopefully they continue running it. The mini cone was not too sweet and I was able to taste both the matcha and black sesame. No credit/ debit for small purchases and $2 special is only for the mixed flavour. Probably would go back again."}
{"text":"Love their soft serve ice cream here, even though it is like $4.5 for a cone of black sesame and green tea ice cream it is worth it, parking here sucks though"}
{"text":"The yummiest Mocha in town!
My friend and I shared the mocha Cream Brûlée ($5.5) & mocha black sesame swirl soft serve ice cream in a cup ($5). Both sesame & mocha are very strong so I would prefer having the mocha alone. The cream brûlée was not too sweet so that's great for my taste. 
Will definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"Employees are not very friendly or welcoming, seems if you don't speak Chinese they make u feel ignorant about their products. The place was empty when we arrived 8 of us. 2 employees were reading a magazine in the sitting area and the place was very warm and no AC. They hesitated when I ask if they could keep the door open. It was cooler outside than the inside. 
I love black sesame. The green tea was on the strong side ok for me but my kids didn't like it. 
I hope they train better their employees it was a real turn down and embarrassment to bring my relative from France to this place.
I can recommend the sesame flavor but the bad service will definitely makes me not interested to come back or recommend others."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE GREEN TEA MATCHA LEMONADE. I came in on a hot day thinking that that would be a good idea to get. Tasted like seaweed and vomit, with a horrible aftertaste. And it was expensive ($5 for something that tastes like absolute dog poop). Honestly, this whole little store just isn't worth your hard-earned buck."}
{"text":"I visited Tendou on a Saturday night and essentially everything was sold out. I tried the green tea soft serve which was very flavourful. I think it was actually a lot more concentrated in matcha flavour compared to ones I've had in Japan! My sister had the mix of sesame and green tea also said it was good. My only complaint was that we waited an extremely long time for the soft serve as it seemed there was something wrong with the machine yet they didn't really say anything to us... would only go back to try the other desserts and the Hokkaido drink."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit here. As a matcha addict, I find their matcha soft serve by far has the most authentic taste of how matcha should taste like. Sweet but could still taste the bitterness. It's not as creamy as Woofles and Cream (another dessert place that offer matcha soft serve) but flavour wise is definitely much stronger than Tsujiri (matcha dessert in Toronto). 


The only drink I had previously was the Kaoru Matcha. I asked the owner which of the following beverages has the strongest taste of matcha. He recommend this one and the other one that was listed beside this drink (forgot what it's called). I believe the only difference between both was this one blends in with milk, the other doesn't and the other one uses a sweeter matcha powder. Kaoru Matcha taste very refreshing and light. It's not too sweet and I'd say it tasted a bit different than what I had before.  If you're looking for a drink with a strong bitterness taste of matcha. This wouldn't be your best option. 

Their menu was kind of small. Mainly consist of around 10 different beverages, soft serves, and few hot food. Besides beverages, everything else are still off the menu. I think they're slowly building up their selections. After all, they only been open for less than a month. 

They do offer a generous size of samples if you ask which was very nice of them. I tried a sample of their matcha opera cake. The presentation of the cake was very pretty and elegant but I didn't find it any special and it was a bit pricey. 

I've heard their black sesame drink was good. I, myself, a huge fans of black sesame. I would definitely go back again and try out other beverages on their menu!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  I hav the soft serve Green Tea Matcha and Black Sesame swirl.   Both are excellent and I never thought mixing the 2 works too. I hope to try the drinks next time."}
{"text":"Tried the Black Sesame and Matcha Twist. It was really good! Now i don't have to trek downtown to Uncle Tetsu for some good soft serve. Tried the Green Tea Red Bean frap, that one was mediocre."}
{"text":"Visited this place after dinner and its really small. The macha soft serve ice cream is a little bitter for me."}
{"text":"Meh.

Was super excited after seeing everyone's amazing shots of the soft serve.. came here after dinner at 9PM on a Saturday and was a few minutes too late..they had run out of matcha soft serve :(.

I ended up getting the sesame soft serve in a cup (~$4.50) .. it was a nice dessert but a little too sweet for my liking and the sesame flavor was lacking. I agree with other yelpers that there was indeed an unpleasant smell upon entering.

The line went slow, getting my ice cream took a few minutes (why?!??!!).. and they only accept debit/cash.

Probably will not be back.. better off buying a tub of ice cream from T&T. :)"}
{"text":"I came back for their matcha daifuku/mochi with my friend recently, couple months after my first visit. Unfortunately, it doesn't uphold the same quality as what they used to be. Besides, there is a pretty big size difference compared to what we used to have before. (It is close to a double) 
Not trying to worry you, but that's a strong refrigerator scent and we guessed the mochi might have sit in the fridge for quite awhile in which that explained why it has a harder exterior. Based on that, I think it no longer worth a $5 price tag. Until they are getting back to their previous standard, I wont be coming back for their mochi again."}
{"text":"I'm so sad they closed down!! This place is always packed with people on a summer night, it used to be one of my go to spots last summer and I'd be here after dinner like 1-2 times a week. The location was such a good spot too. 

I've gotten their Hokkaido Milkshake Frappe many times and it is soooooo gooood. It's pretty much just milk blended with ice, but it's not your typical Canadian milk - you actually taste the difference, and it's exactly like the milk I've tried in Japan. I also love how the drink isn't too sweet. I'm going to miss this so much.

Now onto what Tendou is actually known for - their matcha soft serve. The flavours definitely changed over time. It used to be very strong and slightly bitter matcha with bits of green tea leaves or something like that, and I loved it. Then it started to taste a little more diluted? bland? It was still good, but the quality changed. The colour got lighter and the bits of tea leaves disappeared. However, I do love their sesame soft serve, it's very delicious. I always get the swirl cause that's the best of both worlds haha. I've also tried their matcha daifuku and that is soooo yummmmy. I just love when dessert places aren't overly sweet."}
{"text":"Green Tea Soft Serve - 6 stars. Holy shoot this is bomb. So authentic.. not too sweet and very flavourful on the matcha. The consistency is super smooth, no chunks at all. Even when it starts melting it turns more into a paste rather than liquid... so much matcha goodness in here.

Black Sesame Frappe - 3.5 stars. I was really anticipating the black sesame taste but unfortunately it was a bit too much ice and less creamy than I wanted. Not a big fan of red bean but the topping was pretty good. Next time I'll try the black sesame ice cream directly. 

Many items were sold out at closing time (creme brulee, cake, etc) so I will try to come earlier next time. 

Unfortunately it is not very pleasant to stay there to eat. The place is small and not comfortable. There is a table right at the front that kinda blocks the front door when people are seated there. The other thing I noticed was a strong bad odour.. maybe body odour or something."}
{"text":"After dinner we took the kids to Tendou as we've been wanting to come here for a long time.  Now that the winter freeze is over its a great time to go!

Basically there are only 3 flavours of soft serve ice cream, matcha, black sesame and a mix of the two...okay its really only 2 flavours:) 

The matcha and black sesame ice cream here is really rich and delicious.  Personally I found the flavour much better then places like Tsujiri downtown.  Price wise Tendou is also cheaper and the portions larger so there's absolutely no reason to go anywhere else!

Its a tiny place with seating for around 10-15.  Service was very nice and we definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Heard amazing things about this place, especially their soft serve. I got the black sesame soft serve in a cup...and it's officially my new favourite ice cream flavour! SO GOOD! You can definitely taste the black sesame but it's not overly sweet so it's the perfect balance. I would recommend getting it in a cup though. We saw other people getting it in their waffle cones and you definitely get more bang for your buck in a cup. Besides, the waffle cone comes premade so it's nothing special...now if it was a freshly made waffle cone, then that's another story. 

My boyfriend decided to get the sencha series in their peach flavour. Nothing spectacular...my boyfriend described it as \"a very big juice box\". My other friend wanted to get their matcha lemonade except we were told they didn't have any matcha which was odd seeing that it's a matcha dessert place.......

In terms of seating, be prepared to take your order to go. Very limited seating....very limited...

Nonetheless, I'm really looking forward to going back to this place! Would definitely recommend their soft serve and you just can't go wrong with ice cream in this ridiculously hot weather!"}
{"text":"Located in a plaza across Markham Civic Centre. It's a tiny shop with only a few tables for seating so a lot of people just grab and go especially during peak hours (evening after dinner).

Best matcha and black sesame soft serve I had was here (although I haven't had that many). The matcha soft serve was strong in flavour and had the slight bitterness aftertaste like real matcha tea and was really smooth in texture. The black sesame soft serve was the opposite. It had a slight grittiness so you know they used actual grounded up sesame. Both flavours weren't too sweet and went well as a swirl to balance the flavour intensity.

Service was mediocre, they weren't unfriendly, just took my order and ringed me through. A smile goes a long way though!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at around 7pm and I was surprised that there were no customers in the store. Service was simple and straight forward. 
I ordered the Matcha Cone ($5) and it was made and given to me before change was given back! The cone was A LOT bigger than I expected. I shared it with a friend and we could barely finish it. The soft serve was more bitter than sweet, which is right up my alley. Love the authentic matcha taste.
Will come back again to try out the bowls."}
{"text":"Best matcha ice cream in the gta hands down!! 
Get the matcha black sesame swirl. It's fantastic. 
The prices are a little steep for just ice cream. But if you like your green tea ice cream, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The matcha was good but sesame was better...the jelly was weird tasting.small.place only good for take out...not a lot of tables ..."}
{"text":"This place is cool. It's really dark/dingy inside though, and not much seating available. Apparently it's a big deal that they need to make a distinction that there is a difference between Taiwanese matcha powder and Japanese matcha powder. I am guessing they use the latter. I've tried both the swirl and just matcha verision. I really liked it. It was  $6.20 (tax included) for a black seasame and matcha twist w waffle cone. Not bad. Both flavours pronounced and strong, which I like. Also, it was huuuuge. I shared it, no way I could finish it myself. They occasionally have special promos for their smaller versions."}
{"text":"The place is a small shop with a few tables. They served soft served ice cream and drinks.  

The black sesame ice cream here is so good. The ice cream was creamy and has a strong sesame flavour. One of the best sesame soft serves I've tried. 

The matcha soft serve was not as good. It was really bitter. It wasn't really sweet. But if you like strong matcha flavoured ice cream then you should try it.  

The matcha latte was also pretty good."}
{"text":"Matcha soft serve tastes like store bought green tea ice cream in a soft serve format. It's smooth and creamy, but nothing special in terms of matcha flavour."}
{"text":"I went during the grand opening when they had their $2 mini cones and had a black sesame and matcha swirl soft serve cone. The service was good. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Service was quick too. 

The matcha part tasted amazing. It was very strong in flavour and slightly bitter, just how good matcha should be. It was absolutely perfect being swirled with the black sesame as it was sweet and balanced smoothly with the matcha. I've never had black sesame ice cream before and did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. 

If you love matcha like I do, I highly recommend this place. I will be back to try some of their other products. They also have a few other ice cream options as well as drinks. I hope the service and food quality don't go down after the grand opening.

*This place has limited seating and is cash/debit only"}
{"text":"5 for soft serves and sundae 
4 for matcha opera cake
2 for frappe 
4 for service and location"}
{"text":"I came with my friends at night and it was pretty busy with a long line. They have a two main flavors: matcha and sesame soft serve. You can choose from a variety of choices of how you want them. I tried the matcha and sesame twist soft serve and it was so rich and filling but still very good."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 3.5 if I could. 

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and managed to find 3 empty tables. My friend and I ended up sitting there for over an hour with no crowds. This was most likely because of the storm that day. We noticed many customers ordering to go. 

We ordered the Shiratama anmitsu swirl and iced matcha latte (because matcha milk tea ran out). Both matcha and black sesame soft serve were very good but I preferred the black sesame as it was more flavorful and distinct. I wouldn't say the sundae was too impressive in terms of taste and presentation-wise. They threw in a scoop of red bean paste, three mochi and these clear sweet jelly, toppled with some blueberries, strawberries and a blackberry. If I visit again, I'd stick with the soft serve in cone. 

As with the drinks, they were rather disappointing. I had the iced matcha latte, nothing special. Went back to try the matcha milk tea and it tasted exactly the same as the latte; with no tea flavor. Both just tasted like very sweet milk. I don't plan on trying their other drinks.

+ this did not affect the rating I gave but Tendou really needs to turn up (down?) the AC. It's so hot and stuffy in that place."}
{"text":"This place is unique because it's hard to come across matcha and black sesame soft serve ice cream! We decided to go full out and get the mochi and red bean with mix of black sesame and green tea ice cream. This place was getting a lot of hype, and I don't think it lived up to that hype. It's still good but it's nothing special. I also think it's pricey for what it costed which was around $8."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I was actually super excited to find out that Markham now has their very own matcha green tea soft serve! AND bonus - black sesame flavour too! I made my way up just so that I could compare it to Tsujiri downtown ^^

First off, the presentation is absolutely awful here. My soft serve in a cup was like the leaning tower of pisa lol. The guy preparing mine was absolutely messy. I know you want speed but I want quality, really.

Taste wise, I enjoyed the black sesame soft serve a lot but definitely not a fan of their matcha green tea - it was way too bitter for my liking. It's either you love it or hate it... there is no in between! I have friends who loved the bitterness so much and they have the exact opposite review when it comes to Tendou vs. Tsujiri.

Get the swirl (a twist with 1/2 black sesame and 1/2 matcha green tea) - at least it gives a good balance if you don't like it too bitter! And skip the fancy toppings; you don't need that stuff.

I will come back just for the black sesame! Hopefully they fix their leaning towers by then lol Or seriously, I can shown them how."}
{"text":"It really does not live up to the hype for me. The ice cream isn't very creamy and I felt it was quite bland. Neither flavor tasted much like what it was suppose to and for that price, I expected better texture, more flavorful ice cream. Even though the center was completely hallow, I didn't even bother finishing it. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't 8 dollars worth of delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the warabi mochi swirl! The softserve was soft and on the verge of melting. Matcha was bitter and the sesame had no taste; just sweet. Same with the red bean...very sweet. The hightlight was the mochi jelly which was different and was starting to grow on me. 

Unfortunately, this dessert was just a whole lot of just sweet with no flavour. I guess the non-aromatic sesame soft serve is there to balance it out."}
{"text":"I'm liking my black sesame soft serve. matcha opera wasn't bad either and it was presented really well, will come back to try their trending frappe and black sesame frappe. Their Creme Brûlée unfortunately was already sold out . Oh well the perks of living close by"}
{"text":"There's literally nothing around here except the Hilton and this place is a great escape for all the guests staying here for a wedding... Their matcha and sesame flavors are actually quite strong. I like that the menu is simple, but you can still customize your order with the red bean paste, fruits and mochi - yum! I would recommend sharing the order with one other person though."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Treat yo'self to Tendou's matcha and black sesame soft serve swirl. The matcha bears a true, slightly bitter potency. The black sesame retains the distinct, strong sesame flavour but compliments the matcha with ease. The flavours cooperate so well. The generous serving is a great bonus. 

It is my pleasure to place my business with shoppes like Tendou that serve up highest quality matcha with pride. Absolutely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Drop in at around 11.30 pm at night for a quick desert. No line up. Tried the twist soft serve with cone. Ice cream was delicious, the cone was crunchy but had a rice type flavour to it."}
{"text":"Small little place. Wanted to sit and catch up with some friends and there were no tables. It was my first time here and i didnt know what to order. And being me, ofc i would ask for recommendations, but they barely speak english and couldnt explain to me what's the difference and what come with it lol so i ordered one that had everything. The soft serve was really good. I like both green tea and black sesame. And the mochi is my fav. Soft serve crave satisfied."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza where Gal's Sushi is; nice little ice cream shop that has joined the group of dessert shops/restaurants in this plaza. Parking is not easy to find here, but there is underground parking available; once you get out of the elevators the shop is on your left, which is the back door. If you want the front door you'll have to go outside and round back.

The shop itself is not too hard to find, just a bit small with very limited seating. Not ideal for group meet ups as there are less than 4 tables there. There are high chairs seating against the wall but, again, seating is limited. It's a nice, clean open area but probably due to the size of the shop there's not a lot of seating available; take out is the next best option, especially if you live across the street.

Their menu is not vast but seeing they've just opened for a month or so hopefully they'll get to expanding it - they can start by offering various sizes for their orders instead of one generic size. They might also want to look at their lighting fixtures; it was flickering the whole time I was there.

Not too many places offer black sesame soft serve so if you're here do give it a try. It's a tad pricey, especially if you get it in a cup, but it's not overly expensive. If you want a better deal you might as well get it in a cone - it's a dollar difference. The texture is very smooth and creamy, and I'm happy to say it's not overly sweet like some places can overdo. The black sesame flavour is prominent, which is perfect.

Nice stop in warm weather; have yet to try their frappes but will definitely return to try it."}
{"text":"Tendou is a small dessert shop that specializes in Japanese-style matcha and black sesame desserts. The decor is nice and modern, and there are a couple of tables for those that want to eat inside. Their matcha soft serve is the perfect balance of the slightly bitter taste of matcha and the sweet taste of ice cream for me. The portions are also fairly large for the price."}
{"text":"Poop, wanted ice cream on a Monday afternoon but they don't open on Mondays so I went Tuesday after work. Parking lot was full, but inside the shop, I was their only customer there. 

If you've been on instagram lately, you know everyone is taking pics of their soft serve swirls (me included). But too bad that their black sesame ice cream machine was broken because I was very much looking forward to trying it!! :( This means over half their menu was \"currently unavailable\" but I was recommended to try the frappe which I politely declined. The menu items are similar to Tsujiri if you've been to the dessert shop on Yonge/Dundas. I had the green tea cone ($5) even though I prefer cup (#doitforthegram) as well as the sencha mango pineapple drink which I thought both was ok.. nothing very special. Texture was very smooth and matcha does have that bitterness authentic flavour. Maybe I'm just bitter that I was very set on black sesame heh. Do check their facebook page for updates though.

Interior was super blue-ish green from the walls haha. Sufficient seating for a dessert shop but lighting was weird.. too dark when the lights were off and when the lights were on, it had an annoying flickering which also needs to get fixed. 

Desserts shops are becoming popular in the GTA and so is Pokemon GO! Tip cups were clevering using this to their advantage (#teamvalor) and the nice lady at the front had a cute Pokemon shirt. 

I'll come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"Not good at all. I went there on a weekday around 4:30. There's only few people inside the shop. Once I enter the shop, it smells really bad & it gives me an impression that is really dirty. I just brought the matcha ice cream as there's the black sesame is out of service. It tastes alright but not the quality I expect."}
{"text":"The matcha ice cream is the best in the gta. The matcha flavour is rich and the soft serve is smooth. The black sesame was also very rich but I'm not a fan of black sesame.  I'm not a fan of the other desserts but likely because their soft serve is great on it's own."}
{"text":"Below expectations...

It's a tiny place in a plaza with not much else good stuff in it. The decor is not pretty and definitely not conducive to photos. The matcha ice cream is really bitter like matcha naturally. I did like that it's not super sweet though. The black sesame ice cream was yummier. The dessert isnt very photogenic even though there are so many photos of it on instagram. The prices are pricey around $6.5 for the cup with toppings."}
{"text":"Meeehhhh, I came here for the photos early Sunday morning.  

The matcha and sesame soft-serve was so-so. The taste was very subtle and not too sweet which was a plus but nothing to get excited for.

The sesame smoothie or slushie or whatever was sooo bland.  

The service was nice and the store was clean.

But no thanks :)"}
{"text":"This weekend they had the $2 special mini cones, which I decided to get ( a swirl of matcha green tea and black sesame). The ice cream here is smooth, creamy and quite rich. I liked the taste of both but prefer the black sesame better. The matcha green tea is a little bit bitter. 

The prices here ranged from about $5 where you can get the ice cream in a cup and cone. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area to try the other treats!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to Tendou was when they first opened and they had that promo twist mini cone special. I thought the ice cream was decent, but couldn't make much of a judgement because the mini mini cone was only 2 bites. I decided the line was not worth it, and have not been back since.

Suddenly craving matcha soft serve, I decided to give Tendou a second try. This time I ordered their twist cup. For $4.50 I thought it was reasonably priced because there was A LOT (I wish I had shared it with someone else!). The ice cream was creamy (although not the creamiest I've ever had).

The black sesame alone was quite good and flavourful as others have noted, and the matcha ice cream definitely has that authentic matcha taste. That being said, this \"authentic\" tea taste makes the matcha ice cream a little bit on the bitter side...and having always thought that I (snobbily) liked everything \"authentic\", I think I prefer my ice cream sweet. Together, the black sesame and matcha flavours don't exactly go together like vanilla and (insert any ice cream flavour here)....BUT....I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"It's weird how I find the black sesame ice cream better tasting than the matcha when it's supposed to be more well known for their matcha.
They have different infused matcha green tea items ranging from cakes, mochi, soft serve and drinks.
Good for after dinner dessert or when you don't feel like something to sweet"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

Vanilla and Matcha twist Soft serve ice cream ($5.50 on a cone)
I came on a weeknight and they were sold out of black sesame flavor which was very disappointing - I was hoping to get match/black sesame. Anyhow, the ice cream was good. The matcha had strong matcha flavor and the vanilla wasn't too sweet so both flavors together was actually a really good mix. One thing that did suck was the way they swirled the ice cream as it left a big whole in the middle. 

I'll be coming back to try their other dessert items. Definitely want to try their black sesame ice cream, and possibly the green tea opera cake."}
{"text":"Solid place for some matcha and black sesame ice cream.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tendou is a quaint little ice cream shop with decor and colours that resemble their two specialty flavours: black sesame and matcha.

I got the Swirl Kinako Azuki Shiratama ($7). The bitterness of the matcha matches well with the sweet nuttiness of the black sesame. The red azuki beans are sweet, but not overpowering and the mochi balls are a nice textural contrast.

Tendou do what they do very well. I would definitely come back if they introduce new Asian flavours."}
{"text":"New matcha cafe in Markham?! Definitely needed to check it out! We went around 3pm on Canada day and there were about 5 people in front of us. Nonetheless, the service was pretty quick. However, there were no desserts left (all sold out).

Matcha soft serve in cone: $4 before tax. The matcha flavour was strong and the consistency of the soft serve was impressive. Thick and creamy! You could see the specks of matcha powder in it. 

Black sesame soft serve in cup: $4 before tax. I don't know if it was because it's the black sesame soft serve or the fact that it was in a cup that made it melt almost immediately. 1 minute after stepping out of the place, it didn't look appetizing anymore. However, the black sesame flavour was strong albeit a bit too sweet for me. If it didn't melt so quickly, I would've enjoyed it more.

I definitely want to come back to try the desserts when they have it again but it most certainly doesn't compare to Tsujiri downtown in terms of variety and a really rich matcha flavour. However, this is located in Markham, which makes it more accessible to me :) Check it out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around 12:30 
one thing that i find off was that the place smelled really bad. Like a toilet pipe burst.
first time i visited this place the smell was too strong that i had to leave without ice cream.
Came back a second time and the smell was still there but was not as strong.

They only accept cash or debit.
I got the black sesame in a cone that came up to $5.65 after tax
The flavor was nice and light. It was creamy and soft.
The cone was just right not too sweet and was crunchy.

I would come back and try the green tea or the twist with the black sesame again :)
Hopefully the smell will be fully gone."}
{"text":"Very authentic matcha soft-serve. I did not enjoy the sesame as much as it was a little too sweet and overpowered the matcha when eaten together. I love their 2 dollar snack size cone option."}
{"text":"I went here for dessert with my family and I had no expectations of it whatsoever. I thought it would just be another asian dessert place but I found this place very unique. I ordered the hokkaido milkshake  and I was in love with it!! Not your regular milkshake thats forsure. We also got the black sesame dessert and it was delicious. Aside from the food I found the atmosphere such a friendly place. At a first glance it is very simple but if you look around and if you like memes you will appreciate this place. For example they have salt bae but edited a photo of him so he sprinkling matcha instead and called him #MatchaBae i loved that. They also have a rayquaza figurine and drawings of Spongebob characters like Squidward dabbing. Its a cool chill place with great desserts and drinks!!"}
{"text":"I tried it on a weekday night. The ice cream are soft serve and made in house. So it's pretty good, not watery nor too hard. I got it with the jelly and other topping in a twist. Not too bad but the price for it is a bit up there for ice cream. Also, they skipped on renovation so the atmosphere is not as good. Seating is also limited.(but you can't really blame them) My suggestion on making this a more successful dessert is to do some renovation. Make it a more welcoming atmosphere. Also, some hot dessert needs to be serve. Winter is coming and I know some people will have ice cream in winter, I'm not really one of them."}
{"text":"Their matcha ice cream is really rich in taste a must try if your taste buds are craving ice cream soft serve . This place is small but it does have a nice amount of seating a few small tables and one large one for a nice group. 
Also they got a swirl ice cream of matcha and 
Black sesame seed which also taste very nice. 
Note they stay open late till 12am so your late night cravings so satisfy your late night cravings!!"}
{"text":"Did someone say black sesame ice cream?!??! Wait.. matcha as well?! 

After hearing about this combo, I decided to try their twist: black sesame and matcha soft serve. At first, it was quite difficult to grasp onto the flavour of the black sesame in the the twist, however with a couple more spoons the flavour became more apparent. I thoroughly enjoyed the black sesame flavour more than the matcha. It has that roasty and nutty taste to it which I absolutely love. It is not too sweet however, I find it a bit overpowering when paired with the matcha. The matcha is not as strong in flavour; it is more on the sweeter side I find. It has a hint of a grassy taste and similar to the matcha ice creams you'd get at any Japanese AYCE. The texture of the soft serve is very smooth. 

One thing that caught my attention was the core of the soft serve... other Yelpers have noted this as well and that is hollow in it. Not sure if it is meant to be this way or that it is a lack of consistency..? But anyway, I'd definitely stop by for some black sesame when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the Best Matcha ice cream in Toronto. Sesame Ice cream has the strong taste too.  
Get the swirl, it's the best combo and so yummy.  


It's small ice cream place, best for take out."}
{"text":"I hope you love matcha as much as I do. Tendou doesn't disappoint.

I highly recommend Kurogama Frappe ($6.25) if you like black seasame as much as I do. It is just like having a black sesame milkshake,

A limited selection of dessert but no menu as yet. Mochi Inspired Waffle ($7) though sounds like a good idea but in reality was a fail a chewy texture and hardly any fillings. Even for someone like myself that does not like sweet found it bland and boring.

Give it a try. An decent option for some authentic matcha soft serve with real matcha taste.

 I hope they will put the name and pricing of the desserts soon as it would have made ordering so much easier. And sure more people would have give those a try.


Cash Only"}
{"text":"While matcha-flavoured things have been gaining in popularity for a while, Tendou tries to bring something slightly different to the table with their black sesame soft serve. Besides some other drinks and desserts that they offer, their main thing is their soft serve which comes in 3 flavours: matcha, black sesame, or twist. You can also get sundaes with various toppings. They have photos of all their sundaes above the cash register, but it's hard to tell from the pictures and names what is in each one. 

I ended up ordering a twist sundae with fruit and mochi. The texture of the soft serve is quite creamy, and the flavours individually, both matcha and sesame, are quite good. However, once they started mixing together, the matcha very quickly overpowered the sesame, which was a bit unfortunate. My recommendation would be to eat one side at a time. The sundae was like $6.50 plus tax, which is only a dollar more than the cone, so I thought it was worth it for the extra fruit and mochi. 

I would come back to try their sesame soft serve by itself. From what I could taste before my ice cream started to melt and blend, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Matcha & Dessert? Sounds like heaven to me! (Which is ironic since Tendou means 'way to the sky') Service at Tendou is very knowledgeable and all their matcha powder is imported straight from Japan.

I tried the Black Sesame & Matcha Swirl soft serve in a cone and it was delicious! It was definitely something that was unique and worth trying out. The matcha flavour wasn't overly sweet and was a rich, yet not overwhelming, slightly bitter matcha flavour. I prefer the soft serve at Tendou over Tsujiri as I find Tsujiri too sweet. The black sesame was delicious and was a strong and rich black sesame taste. Both my friends and I actually loved the black sesame soft serve and would go back just for the black sesame. Bonus that it's quite large!

I definitely can see myself returning for some soft serve here! Just a downside is that they don't take credit cards & that they don't offer any loyalty cards/stamp cards/Vicinity. The decor is very simple - I personally think the walls are a strange shade of green and the lights are a little flickery if your away from the window but these aren't dealbreakers. The place would benefit with more seating though as the wall tables aren't really a great use of space and may be difficult to find a place to just sit for awhile to chat with friends on busier days."}
{"text":"As a lover of all things matcha, I am declaring my biases in yet another review. It is my hubris. Yes, full disclosure (in another post related to matcha), I once finished two-liters of green tea ice cream in two days. Second disclosure, I am a pretentious matcha snob with a bamboo whisk,  bowl and ceremonial grade matcha at home.   

As a lover of all things matcha, I love the emergence of matcha-focused stores! It makes my heart sing with joy! 

Tendou's Matcha soft-serve ($4 for cup, $5 for cone) was great! It's everything the promise of matcha soft-serve would be. Rich creamy soft luscious ice cream with a hint of bitterness from the Matcha. 

Did it pass the matcha test? Likely not. 
Will I reject anything with matcha? Likely not. 
Is this review bias? Absolutely. 
Will I indulge in it again? Absolutely! Even if it is in the middle of winter and the temperature is before zero!"}
{"text":"Based on initial visit, I would have given the matcha soft serve 5 stars! Matcha taste was very strong, enhanced by the tea leaves in it. Other places that sell matcha soft serve (tsuijiri / uncle tetus) were much more sweeter in comparison to cater to Canadian taste buds. Owner wanted to bring uniqueness and satisfy his own taste buds. It was the best soft serve I ever had!! Unfortunately, the owner decided to now cater to the vast majority (to money) and we can now no longer get that strong matcha flavour again. 

The soft serve isn't bad, just wasn't as good as it was before. But the other desserts needs big improvement. The mochi waffle has an overly chewy texture with absolutely no taste. The takoyaki dessert was another fail. It should be kept as a savoury item instead. The shell was nothing like a cream puff texture as promised. 

I haven't lost hopes entirely. Please bring back the original soft serve recipe!!!"}
{"text":"This was so promising - but with critical mistakes made, I cannot rate this any higher. Let me tell you all about it.

My friend and I were just craving dessert and wanted a place to catch up - and I found this on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. We arrived around 8:30 pm on a Saturday and it was fairly busy but I was still able to grab a seat with my friend. We looked at the menu, which ranged from simple soft serves (matcha and black sesame) to delicate sundaes. 

I decided to get a twist cone with both flavours ($5.50). The cone was immediately given to me, and it looked beautiful (see photo). I had my first bite and it was completely heavenly. The flavour of the black sesame was very earthy and true. On the other hand, the matcha complimented it well with its cut of mild bitterness. This was gearing up to be a 4/5 at least - if not 5/5 experience. 

And then I ate a little bit more and faced the critical mistake. There was a hole in the middle of my soft serve. That is just not right given that I paid $6+ after tax for the cone. In addition, after a few minutes, the bottom of the waffle cone was dripping ice cream at a rapid rate. This made for quite the messy experience. 

Overall, Tendou was super promising - they had their flavours down! But with poor attention to detail with regards to making the ice cream cone and a poor waffle cone design, I'd be hard pressed to give it any more than a 3/5. So unfortunate."}
{"text":"When it comes to matcha , this place does matcha right. From soft serve ice cream to their cakes they are matcha-licious.  

Their black sesame ice cream is also soooo good especially when you get the matcha and black sesame swirl.

The people who work there are super nice as well.

I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I wish I had a decent picture of the Hokkaido milkshake but it was so good that I finished it before I even realized I had to take a photo of it for this review. 

I'm generally not a big fan of dessert places, but I was recommended to come here. The owner was nice enough to give me some of the black sesame and matcha ice cream on the house too because he had made extra! Tendou, although is not necessarily a sit down restaurant, still has really great service and the quality of their ice cream (which is made from scratch) and their milkshakes is great.

10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"Ordered the black sesame frappe (with red bean) and it was very good. The flavour was very strong and texture was thick. Comes with 1 size but it's big enough to fill you up. Will come back again. 

Customer service was friendly and product came fast. 

Had to minus a star because the place was hot and tiny."}
{"text":"Only accept cash or debit. Limited menu selection. I tried the black sesame soft serve in a waffle cone ($5). I think it's a bit pricey but I guess it's comparable to other places nowadays. It had a great black sesame flavour with a nice texture to it from the grounded sesame seeds. I would definitely come back for this again."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite ice cream places! The matcha soft serve is very smooth with an authentic green tea flavour. Unlike other matcha ice creams or soft serves I've had, it is not overly sweet, and has a very rich matcha taste to it. The black sesame soft serve is also very good, but I would rather get a twist or just the matcha--not the black sesame on its own. The price is also very reasonable, with the cheapest option being a mini waffle cone with matcha or black sesame soft serve for $3. I happened to be in the area today and just had to stop by for this delicious, cool, refreshing treat!"}
{"text":"Came here when they first opened and had their mini swirl cones for $2! The combination was pretty good and I quite enjoyed the creamy texture of the black sesame without the taste being too overwhelming. However, the matcha tasted kind of disappointing - it was grainy and sort of made the the aftertaste not as enjoyable. Still, a good option for dessert at the price point! Would get again when in the area after a meal"}
{"text":"Love it!  The black sesame soft ice cream in a cup with bunch of different desserts like red beans, unknown gelatine squares rolled on toasted flour  etc. Overall, the sweet combination is quite good. It's different and worth trying."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of tendou! It is my new favourite soft serve spot uptown. They only do two flavours (for now) - matcha and black sesame, both of which are amongst my favourite all time flavours. Of the two, I actually prefer the matcha, which is ultra smooth and has that slightly bitter matcha taste that I love. It really reminds me of authentic Japanese matcha! The black sesame, I find, is not as creamy and smooth, but makes up for the inferior  texture with bold, delicious sesame flavour. I actually would not recommend getting the twist, because I find that the black sesame dominates the matcha flavour, and the two are not exactly complimentary. I like to enjoy the 2 flavours separately. I have been to tendou many times since it opened and I know I will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Super tiny dessert spot but hands-down serves the best matcha green tea flavoured shaved ice! The store was pretty busy when I got there and had to wait in line for about 5-8 minutes - It was hard to tell where the \"order\" and \"pick-up\" line was.
I got the green tea shaved ice (~$8+). The green tea soft serve was creamy and the red bean paste was tasty as well. Overall I enjoyed my dessert but would probably have a better experience in the summer so I can eat it when it's warm out :)"}
{"text":"Small cosy place and I only get the soft serve ice cream. Very reasonable price for the soft serve. 

I usually only get the plain soft serve so can't comment on other stuff."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places for black sesame and matcha ice cream.  It's so good that my hubby craves for it even during the winter when its minus 20 degrees outside.  Delish!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Saturday evening. It wasn't too busy. Me and my friend were full from dinner, so we both thought of trying this place out and sharing a serving. So we ordered the swirl with red bean, mochi and 2 fruits (shiratama anmitsu) - without clear jelly. 

I am giving a 2/5 for the following reasons:

1. Overrated 
- self explanatory 

2. Nothing special 
- typical matcha and black sesame soft serve (taste is comparable to Walmart tub of green tea/black sesame ice cream - maybe a bit more smooth) 

3. Poor customer service 
- One of the workers who was preparing the food had a very... Impolite attitude. So here is the story:
So my friend has a severe allergic reaction to kiwis, which is one of the 2 fruits that they add onto this item. While the girl was cutting up the fruits, my friend kindly told the cashier that she was allergic to kiwis and asked them to stop before putting them on. The cashier girl told the prep girl to stop, and the prep girl shot a very \"dirty look\" at the cashier (the \"wtf\" look), and grumpily ate the kiwi and took out unwashed raspberries straight from the box. 
By the way, during that whole process, she did not change the gloves, which still had kiwi juice on it. You would think a place that deals with food would know how to react to food safety protocol or allergies. So be careful!

4. Over priced
With tax, my order was $7.35

Results? Never come again"}
{"text":"Tendou is typically known for their naturally flavoured Yame Matcha from Hoshino Tea Gardens in Japan (also being the first business outside of Japan to import their matcha). Hence, their naturally-rich matcha flavour in their soft-serve ice cream. Make sure you get the swirl with black sesame to balance out the flavours.

My personal favourite is their Tofu Cheesecake which has a strong natural taste of tofu - something difficult to achieve, and often imitated with the addition of soy milk. Their philosophy is to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients used (e.g., Matcha, Black Sesame, Hokkaido and Tofu) without overly sweetening their deliciously baked treats or soft serve ice cream. 

Highly recommend this place for post-dinner desserts in Markham!"}
{"text":"I prefer Tendou over Tsujiri by a lot. Tsujiri has that traditional bitter matcha taste while the ice cream at Tendou has a very very mild bitter flavour while having the right amount of sweetness for me. 

I usually don't like black sesame ice cream but this place has changed my mind forever. I even prefer it over the green tea one. I got the warabi green tea matcha which contained green tea matcha ice cream of course, juicy red beans, and some brown sugar to add flavour to the otherwise subpar mochi. I also got the green tea matcha cake which I found to be overpriced but it had more of the bitter flavour people dig. Since people are willing to pay $5 - $6 for standard bubble tea nowadays, I did not find the price of the ice cream to be unreasonable.

Parking at this plaza has always been frustrating. If you don't have patience to wait for someone's spot just go park underground. The closer to the garage entrance you park the better since the stairs which lead to ground level will be in the centre of the plaza which shortens your walking time compared to if you parked near the edges of the lot."}
