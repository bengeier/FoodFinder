{"text":"Came here on a weeknight after hearing some great reviews about this place. Loved the ambiance of the second floor, busy but intimate. Some excellent dishes on the menu, which is constantly evolving, I would have loved to tried a bunch more of them. Highly recommended - the spicy pork meatballs (really tasty!), spaghetti carbonara, and the fried baby octopus. Service is very friendly but it gets busy in here, patience is a virtue. Modest wine and beer lists but some nice choices in there. I look forward to returning, thanks Annabelle."}
{"text":"Overall, a great meal and friendly staff.  Will definitely be back. Small space so gets warm inside.  Wine is expensive."}
{"text":"Great new pasta and Negroni joint, south side of Davenport, West of Christie. Nice variety on the Brunch menu. Super friendly staff. Open kitchen to watch the food prep - fresh pasta made in house is a major plus. Will be back for dinner very soon."}
{"text":"This place is in a great neighbourhood and looks awesome from the street. That's where the good ends. It was terrible. The spaghetti was a joke - Chef Boyardee would be light years better. Save your money. The vegetarian pasta - a zero.
My over/under for how long this place lasts - 8 months. Take the under."}
{"text":"Hubby took me to this nice restaurant for pasta. Very good price, very delicious food. Definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A fun little neighbourhood place. Not the kind of place I'd see taking a big group to. My husband and I did date night there and had the best seats in the house: at the bar where we could watch the staff and chat with them, which was fun. 

The pasta changes nightly, so there's not much point in providing specifics other than to say that fresh homemade pasta has a distinctive texture that some people aren't used to but that I really enjoy. It was tasty; I thought it could perhaps have used a bit more of the proteins and greens. Clearly they want to highlight the pasta itself, but you really do have to rely on the small plates to have a full meal. 

The fried baby octopus, though -- OMG. They cook the octopus sous-vide so it's super tender, and the coating that's added before they flash-fry it is perfect. We also had the nicely garlicky kale Caesar, and wiped up sauces with a puffy round of garlic bread. 

It's a good spot, pretty niche dining, nothing too fancy but clearly there's attention to what they do do, which they do well. They don't take reservations but they do start up a waiting list and you can wait in their cafe next door. Glad to have it in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Swoon! I just adore this place! Such a charming neighbourhood spot.

Four of us went for dinner early on a Sunday night. We were seated right away, and the service that followed was delightful. Our waitress ran us through the menu and suggested the number of dishes to order. We shared the meatballs, octopus, green beans and bread to start and then each had a pasta. The real star was the dessert. The Spanish latte pana cotta was creamy, silky and rich. Hands down the best thing I have eaten so far this year."}
{"text":"First, the good: the negroni menu was stellar and well priced. You can't beat $10 daily pasta specials, which were cooked beautifully and tasted fresh and delicious. They are small portions, but appropriately sized if you get a couple appetizers.

The bad: Ok, so I knew I was taking a risk at 7:30pm on a Saturday night with a party of 3 at a tiny place that doesn't take reservations. We were first on the wait list, and went next door to Bob for a cocktail.The bartender there was a delight and made waiting less terrible. Yummy, simple, but not boring cocktails. We waited about an hour, and I went back to Annabelle to ask how much longer it would be. There was a table ready! I had this feeling that if I hadn't asked, it would have gone to two parties of two. 
We were seated upstairs, and ordered our drinks and food as soon as the server came. As we waited for our appetizer, a table of 4 who were seated after us, were served glasses of wine and several appetizers before we even got our one app to share. I try not to let that kind of thing bother me but I could also tell they were friends with the owner/manager guy and favouritism sucks when it's not benefiting you. While we watched the other table enjoying their food, the song Bring The Funk by Parliament Funkadelic played on repeat at a volume so loud that either we either had to yell across the tiny table or just sit in hangry silence. I'm not kidding, it played twice and it is already super repetitive.  I *NEVER* give bad reviews about things like atmosphere but I swear to my pasta-loving god it was like a torture technique. I like a buzzy loud restaurant but this was so bad, I actually asked them to turn it down which I have never done in my life. But they did it! Yay! Thank you! And then a few minutes later, turned it back up. It just made for such an unpleasant dining experience all around. It overshadowed what should have been a delicious meal. A couple good cocktails could have tied me and my appetite over for the two hours it took to get food, IF it were at all possible to have a conversation with my friends. 
To the management: please, please, please take some time to consider the dining experience and atmosphere. You are a boon to the neighbourhood and deserve to become a local favourite. What a perfect spot for a delicious meal that doesn't hurt the wallet. I'd love to come back on a weeknight, maybe a bit earlier to avoid the rush, to keep drinking negronis and eating bowls of pasta, but I am afraid I'll just hate the experience again."}
{"text":"Very very excited to try this place out - neighbourhood spot that has lots of charm and coziness. I met the owner one day when I popped in to check out the menu, he seemed like a great guy who really wanted to be a part of the community. Yes! Our new local, I hoped. 

We went on a Friday night just before 6pm. We told them we were a group of three, 2 adults, 1 child and they sat us at the teensiest 2 top despite their being two 4 tops sitting empty because \"it gets busy in here on Friday nights\". We waited about 10 mins to place a drink order, then received our apps before our drinks arrived. Not enough room on the table for app plates + drinks.   Pasta was flavourless and on the hard side of al dente. Never approached after we received food so no option to order a 2nd drink. No other party was sat at those 4 tops the whole time we were there. 

I wanted to like this place, but it was quite simply, a very bad experience. I will try again because I'm chalking those errors up to an off night. I will update this review after my 2nd visit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place with fresh pasta, a hipster vibe and reasonable prices, your search is over! For starters, we ordered the BIANCO Po di pane ($6) which is sort of like a fresh panzerotti and boy, did it hit the mark (roasted garlic was super fresh). We also ordered the kale salad ($13) and even though this is typically boring, I really enjoyed this one. For our final starter, we ordered the spicy pork meatballs ($8) and this was hands down the star of the show...best sauce ever! 

In terms of pasta, their menu changes daily with 3 options, which are all priced at $10. Though I love the concept, there was not much variety and they actually ran out of the tomato sauce option. Full disclosure: I still loved my pasta with the pesto base.

FYI - their cocktails are all $13. 

Overall, cool concept, great price and good food. I will definitely be coming back. 

Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Price: 5/5
Food: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"(Extremely) small space, great ambiance if you were eating by yourself upstairs, however we were sharing the space with about 30 other diners and no background music, which made things quite loud.  Not having a dumbwaiter, you will watch the servers navigating up and down the stairs carrying everything, which is actually entertaining in itself.     

Food was excellent, had the shrimp & polpo, the seasonal veg (amazingly grilled eggplant) and two pastas (was told this rotated regularly).  Pasta portions could be a bit larger, but for $10 each you at least have the option to sample a few.

Go if you're looking for negroni and fresh pasta in a loud setting.."}
{"text":"Trendy little restaurant, very loud.
Although the menu is limited, the food was good.
The service was abysmal, the poor waitress was alone and serving two floors.
The manager/chef/host, helped her out a bit. He had a serious attitude problem, I would not go back for that reason.
We ordered the burrata ($22) with garlic toast (bread was the highlight of the night) we sat with our appetizer for 1/2 hour waiting for the bread to go with it. The staff with the attitude was not pleased when I asked for the bread after 20 minutes of sitting looking at the burrata- spend a little money and staff yourself properly. 
Our bottle of wine was finished before our pasta arrived."}
{"text":"Place is tiny, great vibe, excellent food, welcoming and amazing staff! Highly recommend asking to sit upstairs, even if you have to wait a bit. We sat downstairs and unfortunately I now have to dry clean my coat due to the smell from the kitchen. There was so much smoke during dinner, and it made it very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and support a new neighbourhood restaurant.... Sadly it was a series of misadventures. The olives we had as an appetizer were inedibly salty, they brought me the incorrect pasta and I had to wait 15 minutes for the correct one to arrive - by that time my partner had finished dinner. They apologized verbally once when they delivered the pasta, but didn't check in on us again to ask how my meal was, or offer any kind of discount. Pasta was mediocre, and they had no dessert that night (we went early, around 6:30/7). It was a disappointment - we were looking for a low-key, special night and I didn't feel taken care of."}
{"text":"This was not a great night. We waited over and hour for a table only to see a party that came after us seated before us.  The food was average at best. Service lacked service.  We will not be back.  With a city full of choices this will not be one that we return to."}
{"text":"Food :Fresh , Great portions and good for sharing , reasonable prices. 
Atmosphere :Convient, great ambience , cozy and Chic
Service:Fast , exceptional, welcoming   professional.

I will definitely be back again ."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place given how much I adore Lil Baci and how their Instagram looks amazing. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed. The staff was friendly but a bit absent minded (removing a half empty glass of wine, one and forgot our appetizers). The food was subpar to say the least, I ordered fusilli with shrimp and saffron broth, I pretty much got plain pasta with three tiny pieces of shrimp. My friend ordered spaghetti a la Norma which she described as gummy. Also, the place has the worst ventilation. If you are on the main floor you are literally in the kitchen. The smells are overwhelming (I felt sick...never go here pregnant, which I am not) and the smoke was so heavy at times that my eyes were watering and I couldn't carry on a proper conversation. Was relieved to leave but couldn't rid myself of the restaurants potent smell without having a shower as soon as I got home. Disappointing. Also I find the entire \"no email address, no phone number\" thing a bit annoying...especially when you think you've left your wallet there the previous evening."}
{"text":"My friends and I took our parents who were in town for the weekend visiting to Annabelle for brunch today - and our experience was pretty awful to be honest.

To start off, the food here is really great, but unfortunately it doesn't make up for the horrible service. We got there, and it took about 25 minutes for our server to even take our drink/food order. She can't really be blamed since she was the only server and it was pretty busy, but she wasn't particularly pleasant.  A table that came in after us then asked our server if they could order before us since they were \"super hungry\" and she took their order - we were not impressed by this since we had already been sitting for 20 or so minutes. It took 45 minutes for us to get coffees and caesars. Our party of 7 had to sit at 2 different tables which is fine since the space is small, but when our food finally came over an hour later the tables were served at different times. The second table got their food at least 30 minutes later.

All of this being said, we are reasonable people and we understand that this was all likely due to understaffing and poor organization. The brunch menu is definitely too extensive for the small kitchen etc. However, we did mention this to the staff when we left and they weren't apologetic and kept making excuses. In a situation like this bills should be reduced and the drinks absolutely should have been taken off. We noticed several other tables also complained about the service.

I don't typically write reviews or even complain, but there was no management available and it really needs to be mentioned that the quality of service is a huge downfall to the place. We likely will not return based on this experience which is unfortunate since Annabelle has serious potential."}
{"text":"Sure, this restaurant isn't right on the subway line. But it's worth the trek for the fresh pasta made daily. If you're looking to escape the downtown hoards, this place will do nicely for a date or a group. (Or if you want to bring your laptop and drink solo, that wouldn't be out of place here either.) The service was attentive, the food tastes like homemade and looks even prettier. The restaurant is small, but the tables are a good size and spaced out, meaning you're not stuck trying to eat dinner out of your lap or bumping elbows. I'd be okay eating here every night if eating pasta 5 nights a week was socially acceptable. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited that a cute chic-casual spot was opening up in our neighbourhood. But sadly Annabelle was quite disappointing. 

The experience was bad from the first moment I got there. My dining companion arrived before me and was told it would be a 20 minute wait, and the server suggested she go next door to Bob's Coffee bar to grab a drink (same owners). After we waited for about 15 minutes we were told by who I think was the owner that our table for 2 was ready. My friend still had about a quarter of a glass of her wine left, so we asked if we could bring it over. They said no. So then we asked if she could just finish her drink and then head over. The gentleman proceeded to say that he would only keep the table for us \"maybe for 5 mins, but then he'd have to give our table away. We're really busy tonight\". Like, it's not gonna take my friend 20 mins to drink a bit of wine, but how about you don't treat us like we're not welcome? He could tell right away that we were very peeved and then offered to get her a free drink once inside. So we were whisked into the restaurant. The free drink was a decent save but honestly, who treats customers like that, right off the bat before we even enter? 

Then there was the food, overall pretty mediocre. The burrata and garlic bread was very tasty, especially the bread. So warm and soft, I would definitely recommend that. The pasta dishes we had, however, were very disappointing. The pasta itself is tasty as it is made in-house, but the sauces were very lacking in flavour. I had a pork and beef ragu that lacked salt and depth, and my friend's dish was similar, just kinda flat flavours. The mocha panna cotta for dessert also had an unsettling jello-y consistency which was not great. We had a few spoons and gave up on it. 

The drinks I would say are on point here. They specialize in negroni's and the rosewater + ginger negroni I had was great, as well as the wine. That is one star, and the other is for the bread and burrata. But otherwise I was quite disappointed in our initial service and the pasta, which is supposed to be their specialty. They're a new spot so I'm hoping they're just working out the kinks and things will improve, but I won't be returning anytime soon for that reason."}
{"text":"Warning:
They have limited space (the building is small): Which means you may have to wait next door at Bob's Cafe / the chef has little room to cook, which means orders don't come out as fast.

Drinks - not a fan of expensive drinks.  If you're into them though, they do provide a variety of exotic Gin mixed drinks.

Food; not your typical Italian restaurant, the protein is not the star of the dish... which confuses eaters.  This is a Pasta Bar (by classification), its about the pasta.
---------
On to this positives:
Two smart things I like about this place

Thinking of going there? guess what?  They often post the special of the day on their instagram page and you get an idea of what you can be ordering.

Secondly, i like sitting at the bar.  Not that its the best seats in the house... but because you can see the chef cooking and how they handle the pasta.  Did i mention fresh pasta?  Positive.

Maybe its the simplicity of the food / pasta pasta pasta / and most people are use to ordering dishes based on a big piece of protein (fish, steak, chicken) - Thats not what this place is.  Its a pasta bar where proteins take a back seat to well cooked pasta, grated cheese, and vegi's.  

Give it a try.  Solid 4/5"}
{"text":"I came here for a large group event and the upstairs level was booked out for the party. It fit about 20-25 people on the long family style table. The interior was dark, cozy and felt intimate with the candles. They have a good negroni selection and the drinks were strong but some were even sweet enough for me. 

The staff didn't really let us know what was happening though, during mingling they just dropped food off at random tables and didn't let us know what it was or whether we could start eating. Everyone just stood around the appetizers for a while. Until we were all too hungry and decided we should just start. It was also served family style, and I felt like everyone was eating so fast so they can get their portion which made it less enjoyable (or maybe I was just eating with a lot of hungry people) 

We started with these little pizza-like breads topped with cherry tomatoes, basil and parmesan. Lots of bread but it had a good chewy texture which I liked but needed more toppings personally. The Kale Salad was good with lots of cheese and the squash on top was a great mix. I also enjoyed the Pork Meatballs with a red sauce, comforting and classic. 

We got a meat sauce tagliatelle, the pasta texture was good but the sauce felt a bit salty and just unexciting even if it is a basic pasta. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't great. We also got a fusilli with spinach and a big dollop of ricotta, again the pasta noodle itself was good but something just felt bland about it. Overall a little underwhelming since they brand themselves as a pasta bar and I was really excited to try their pastas. 

The best was probably the grilled salmon entree (so not their pasta....) but we got 1 piece to split amongst 4-5 people which was not a lot. It was moist in the middle with a good crust on the outside, perfectly seasoned with a creamy sauce at the bottom. And it came with lots of crispy Brussel sprouts. 

For dessert it was an earl grey panna cotta. Again served family style, so it came in big scooped out blobs that had the color and shine of raw chicken (it did not look that appetizing) But it had lots of strong tea flavor and slightly bitter which I do like, and lots of pistachios sprinkled on top. 

Overall I was really excited to try this place, maybe I just had high expectations there were really good highs and some lows. It's a good choice in the area and I would return perhaps one day."}
{"text":"I'm going to echo some other Yelpers here in saying this restaurant is unbearably loud. The music they play would provide great ambiance if it actually allowed you to hear the other people you're dining with. And this isn't me just being cranky. The party I sat next to expressed the exact same thing. 

Other than that, the $10 dollar pasta dishes are of great value. I've never had any qualms with the food. The dining area is small, however; so be prepared to wait 45 minutes beforehand.

So, food is excellent. But, due the noise I can't really recommend this place unless someone's looking to avoid all conversation with their dinner companion."}
{"text":"Great little (very little) spot.  The downstairs is open to the kitchen, which is cool to watch.  

Ingredients are good quality and pasta is made in house.  Service is friendly and they seem to work well together.  

The pasta specials rotate, and the small plates and appetizers great too.  The meat balls have great flavour !   Enjoy a negroni from their menu while you're watching the kitchen prepare your meal. 

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh made $10 pasta! Awesome drinks. Crazy busy Vibes. Reminds me of lower east side restaurants in NYC! Snacks are great. Would def' go back."}
{"text":"Not bad at all - solid value.

Fresh pasta/negroni bar with a rotating selection of 3 daily specials for around $10 (more for seafood).  The daily specials are posted on their InstaGram page (https://www.instagram.com/annabelleresto/).

There are no reservations and it's cheap-ish neighbourhood spot that getting some hype - so there is a bit of a wait.  Came here on a Monday night around 8PM and waited for about 15 minutes.  They ask you to write your name on the board and you can wait in their sister coffee shop (BOB Coffee) next door.  We were seated upstairs.

The 2.5 oz negroni was solid - can't remember the name but they have a lot of variants.  For appetizers, we got the baked salmon crostini and spicy pork meatballs - both were good.  It was only $8 for two meatballs.

For the mains, we grabbed a pappardelle (zucchini, mint, lemon & ricotta) and the lamb bolognese rigatoni.  The pasta on both were excellent - cooked al dente and gave that satisfying chew.  Found the bolognese sauce a tad salty - but I'm a fan of lamb on nearly anything.  The portions were reasonable and if you're REALLY hungry, it's not to crazy to order 2 pasta dishes considering the price.

The only major complaint is the service can be quite slow - with two servers working two-floor setup - the dishes came out slowly and took a while for us to get the bill.  But the servers did their best and were friendly.

Overall, solid pasta joint offering good value.  I see some other reviews about how disappointed they were - but honestly, I'm not sure what others are expecting for $10/dish.  Honestly, I think ordering pasta while eating out is typically a sucker's play (when consider cost of production and ease of doing this at home) - but I'll make an exception here."}
{"text":"Cozy neighbourhood pasta bar; I love that everything on the menu is reasonably priced & delicious! Will definitely go back to try as many dishes I can!"}
{"text":"Felt very authentic and the ingredients tasted great. 

The potatoes from the shrimp & polpo was so tender, however the baby octopus was a little too mushy. 

The mushroom & truffle on toast was so aromatic. It was definitely good quality truffle oil .

We shared the fresh fusilli pasta with Porchetta. The pasta, as promised, was freshly made. It was soft but enough al dente for my liking. 

The reason I couldn't give it a 5 stars was due to a staff - the waitress who packed up our leftovers and gave us the bill. I swear, i would have made a fuss, but decided to remain complacent in the next scenario. She was cleaning our table and then dropped the fork into my lap. Good thing it didn't end up stabbing me (I was wearing shorts) and no real apology after the accident and then when she came back with the bill and the debit machine, she abruptly asked us how we would like to pay without even giving us time to see the bill first. I said, we'll check the bill first and get back to you (it was very abrupt and unmannerly). With that said, she immediately left our table without any acknowledgement. Maybe she was having a bad day, but I just felt I would ignore the attitude once again and leave this girl to her herself because I really wanted to end my weekend off on a good note, instead of what she projected to us. 

Overall:
- food, 5 stars (great, affordable)
- service: 1 (though our first waitress was great and sweet)"}
{"text":"I had high expectations when I walked in.  The downstairs bar area is adorable and cozy, and the hostess was incredibly welcoming.  Unfortunately the rest of the experience was quite underwhelming.

The menu is pretty limited which is all well and good, but you should know going in that you're more or less limited to pasta and a couple side dishes.  You're at the mercy of the specials board.  If you're a picky eater you might have some trouble.  We split two of the pasta dishes.  Both were very good.  Sadly, not large enough for leftovers.  I acknowledge I'm being a bit of a curmudgeon by saying I expected larger portions for the price.  But hey, you pay for quality!!

I knocked this down to 3 stars because the negroni I had was hard to choke down - and negronis are my go-to! Also, the dessert (panna cotta) was just not good.

Overall, I'd say I'm not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Where to begin. In all fairness, I arrived without a reservation and was asked to wait in their adjacent cafe and bar until a table became available. The host seemed rather put out and acted as if he was doing me a favor but I was determined to try this \"acclaimed handmade pasta\".

The bartender at the cafe was quite pleasant by contrast and the wait went rather quickly.  Eventually, I was seated in the upstairs dining area, which is small, quaint and cozy.  But there ends the atmosphere as the noise level was simply ridiculous. According to my phone app, it was averaging 77-80 decibels, making any conversation impossible.

The appetizer of Shrimp & Polpo w/ Fingerling Potato was nicely presented but any subtly of seasoning was soon destroyed by way too much hot sauce that made this dish more American than Italian.

After a 40 minute wait, the homemade pasta (they usually offer 3 selections for the day on the chalkboard for around $10) finally arrived.  The pasta itself was way undercooked but the accompanying pea sauce was nice.  It just needed something else either texturally (some crushed/toasted nuts) or some acid (touch of lemon) to break the monotony of the dish. 

For a place that prides itself on homemade pasta, I expected better. But if you like the noise level of a rock concert, go for it. Personally, I will pass on a return visit."}
{"text":"The vibe at this place is pretty good. 

but the pasta is not pretty good at all. 

and the salmon my friend ordered was worse than when my mom makes salmon. (my mom is really bad at making salmon...it's always dry. I try and tell her she needs to go easy on the cooking of the salmon...I will leave her a Yelp review too)

It's just like...pasta isn't that hard to make. In fact, it's the only thing anyone really knows how to make. But for some reason the pasta here was just not right. It was over salted yet under seasoned. Overcooked yet undercooked. Just totally uninspiring and really disappointing. 

On the bright side, people told me Annabelle was really good! So now i just wont talk to those people anymore.

Im sorry, okay.

xo"}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday lunch, the place was pretty empty. I love the vibe of this pasta bar specially when the garage doors are open. 
We were hoping for pasta but unfortunately they were serving brunch so we ended up ordered the only pasta on the brunch menu; carbonara. Also ordered the cast iron eggs which had eggplant in tomato sauce, added a sausage and toast. 
The carbonara was decent made properly with real yolks and cheese, the flavour has a slight sourness to it? Wine? 
Anyway the cast iron eggs was the next one, was trying to look for the sausage and was looking for links but they were grounded up,which I wish I just didn't get since you couldn't even taste it. The add toast was a single piece cut in half quiet sad. The flavour of the tomato sauce was alright nothing to rave about. 
Ordering specialty coffees is done by the cafe they own beside it. Pretty neat! 
I wish the place just stick to he pasta dishes all day since the pictures look really good. And I can just imagine myself being there having a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Really sweet neighborhood resto. Friendly staff.  Three pastas daily each for only $10.  Great special bread made with cheese.  Nice drop in place for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Extremely let down. Table for 2, ordered wine and a pasta dish each. After drinks were served, we were ignored for about 40 minutes while everyone around us was served their food. My girlfriend's pasta came first, and mine arrived 5 minutes later. Hers was cold and undercooked - a stuck-together mass of noodles - while mine was so salty I couldn't finish it. We alerted the waiter to the fact that hers was cold and he handled it in a way which made us feel extremely uncomfortable, to the point where my girlfriend elected to finish her cold pasta so that we could simply leave. We were ignored again, with our table candle going out and table water not replaced, until I asked for the bill.

I went in expecting great things, but they failed to provide even an adequate experience on so many levels. A missed opportunity. I know times are tough for Toronto restaurants right now, but this was a poor way to handle it."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this new pasta bar out but was disappointed and underwhelmed after my experience there. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night around 6:30pm where we were lucky enough to get seats at the bar/open kitchen area. Service was friendly but the food was lacking. Maybe it was the specials and pastas that were made that day but most dishes did not stand out at all. Nothing was great nor bad, just average. 

We ordered the octopus, kale salad, burrata special (poached trout with endives), pastas (I got the rigatoni with clams and celery). My favourite dish probably was the burrata because it tasted fresh, but other than that I could have gone elsewhere for better burrata. 

The service of the food took quite a while since we waited at least 30-40  min after our appetizers came out to receive our pastas. We were there for quite a while and other people who ordered after us had their pastas first. People who sat down after us even left before we did. 

Overall, average food, friendly staff but slow service. Won't be returning."}
