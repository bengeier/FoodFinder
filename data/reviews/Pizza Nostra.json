{"text":"Lived in the area 20 years and tried every pizza place. Pizza Nostra is my go to place now. Authentic New Jersey style with a great selection of quality toppings. At the higher end of the price scale but honestly not much more than Pizza Nova, Pizzaville or Pizzaiolo. Especially if you consider how generously sized the small pie is. I've bought my last 12 pizzas from Nostra with no disappointments."}
{"text":"Not a sit down pizza restaurant. But that's fine, because the pizzas are superb! Fresh! I'm talkin' fresh grated grana padano, home made dough, anchovies from the bottle (not from a tin). Toppings are generous and there are a wide variety of optionals. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"friendly service.  a bit pricey, but incredible pizza.  i'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"On our way back to Cleveland after spending the weekend in Toronto, we planned to grab lunch.  Wanting to get out of downtown so we could park in a normal parking lot, my wife found Pizza Nostra on Yelp.  It was a few miles out of our way, but the reviews were telling us it was worth it.  I couldn't agree with the other reviews more.  The pizza is insanely good.

Waiting for our pizza, we chatted with the owners who were two of the nicest guys you will ever meet.  We could have sat and talked with them ate pizza and watched the Jets almost beat the Pats all day long.  We truly felt like we were guests in their kitchen.

We ordered a cheese & onion pizza, and I must admit, it was probably the best pizza I've had in a really, really long time... and I've had a lot of pizza!  Crust was perfect, and the sauce and cheese were stellar.  We talked about ingredients, and the owners told us they wouldn't make a pizza that they wouldn't eat themselves.  It's clear they use fresh high quality ingredients and really care about providing a superior product for their customers.

We will definitely be stopping back at Pizza Nostra when visiting the area again.  I told my wife that I'd drive the 5 hours just to taste that pizza again!  Kudos to the guys at Pizza Nostra, keep it up!  We will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Our usual weekly pizza place is temporarily under renovations. We can't go without our Friday nights with pizza and a bottle of red .... Ever!  Anyway, decided to try this location via pick-up order. Quality was great, service was excellent (nice, friendly people). However, we found it pricey. 2 small pizzas (14\") with 3 choices each came to $41!  We will always pay for quality at fair value pricing, even at a premium. But we felt this was too over-priced."}
{"text":"It's been a little over a year since they opened (and we starting frequenting their establishment!)

I must say that we are still just as enamored with their pizza as we were when we first tried it, and we have been having it every week, like clockwork. 

We look forward to the pizza every weekend - thanks guys for the gastronomic delight so close to home!"}
{"text":"I come for the Hoagies, and enjoy the cheese pizza too. 

Quality vs price. The age old debate. Give me quality every day of the week. 

These guys do that with the hoagie. If you've spent time in New Jersey, its one thing you always look for when you head back. However, its the first time I've found it here, locally, and done great. 

Hoagies take some time to make. You can feel the love in every bite. While its not a Fat Cat from Rutgers, damn, does it ever taste good. 

Glad I came across the spot."}
{"text":"Pizza, Hoagie, and Calzone all highly recommended. Hardest part is what to choose, because everything is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kiki Pizza (medium size) for $35. Yes it was quite pricey, but the ingredients are fresh and you can taste the difference, as cheesey as it sounds....

Their hot sauce drizzle was delicious and added a really nice kick to the pizza. Their crust is what stood out to me the most. It was perfectly crisp on the bottom, yet it maintained a really nice chewy texture that is hard to find with pizza joints in the GTA.

I will return to try their sandwiches next time :) Keep up the good work Pizza Nostra!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in year. It was really cheesy and the tomato sauce was delicious. It did take a bit of time to make like 7-8 mins but it was worth the wait because it tasted so fresh"}
{"text":"If you've read my reviews, you know I seriously love pizza. My fav pizza place is still Lombardi's. But I've found the best pizza outside of NYC. It trumps all other pizza places. Chains? Go get stuffed! Ma and Pa shops? I'm sorry but, this is seriously the best. And for good reason: the folks here got their training in Jersey!

And it is so close to my apartment that my bank account balance is suffering!

I discovered my FAVOURITE PIZZA OF ALL TIME HERE. It's their KIKI pizza! The combination of bitter rapini, creamy ricotta, sweet roasted bell peppers, freshly grated Grana Padano cheese and everything else...it's such an amazing flavour experience, it's really hard to put into words. Just get it. Yes, it's pricey. Yes, it's worth it. Every single time.

Their dough is flavourful and simple. My guess it has flour, olive oil and salt. But I'm sure they won't share their secrets ;) The crust is thin and never overcooked. Their Deluxe is excellent, as is the pizza known as Dayna. Yes, maple syrup on pizza works! Pepperoni is simple and delicious. Margherita is AMAZING. Their house made hot sauce is outstanding, and their salsa verde SHOULD BE SOLD IN MASON JARS. I WOULD PUT THIS SHIT ON EVERYTHING! Herbaceous and tangy, this sauce is out of this world!

The hoagies are delicious. The bread is flavourful and dense. It doesn't taste like you're eating cotton batting. It's FLAVOURFUL. The Cheesesteak is excellent and so is the Italian. But be ready to drink loads of fluids after, but that's only because it's deli meat, and it's high in salt. Still...worth it! The Porchetta may be my favourite. It's hard to choose. And it's PORKETTA. NOT POR-CH-ETTA. You silly goose!

I love their potato wedges as well. Really nice and flavourful seasoning. 

Andreas, Marco, their mama and Lilly are seriously nice and funny people. They don't even mind when my bring my rambunctious son in! :)

The best pizza outside of NYC is in awesome Port Credit on Lakeshore. GO NOW! GO! NOW!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've tried on this side of the city.  Reminded me of New York Pizza.  Awesome crust and sauce with great toppings.  Next time I'll definitely try one of the speciality pizzas.  This will be my new go to for sure.  Also had the Italian hoagie which was amazing.  It was a good size, almost enough to split.  I've been looking for a good Italian sub in the GTA for years and have finally found one.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We liked everything about the pizzas we ordered.  The crust was thin and had good flavor and the right amount of chew.  Toppings were plentiful and of excellent quality. We especially liked that the tomato sauce used was perfectly balanced and not too acidic.  The Dayna is our favorite.  Meatlovers was excellent also but needed onions- we will add them next time.  As others have noted they are more expensive than other pizza places but there is a reason for that.  You can tell by the quality ingredients used.  I can't go back to ordering from Pizza Nova after experiencing Pizza Nostra."}
{"text":"Very good quality, friendly family owned. Best in Mississauga. Try eat in right from the oven !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!!!! The best pizza in the GTA worth a try or 2. I eat here regularly they use top quality ingredients and their dough is unreal. Best pizza dough I've ever had. Small family owned business nice people and great pizza and hoagies (big a** sandwiches) what else could you ask for. Must try is their Canadian pizza and cheese steak hoagie soooo good."}
{"text":"Finally I don't have to go to Etobicoke just for really great pizza!!! Come here all the time now. Great for classic slices or for full pies. Their signature White Pizza is incredible! I was never one for tomato sauceless pizzas but this one is amazing, and so is their Big Marc! Think a Big Mac on a pizza... I know it sounds bizarre but it's seriously delicious and more satisfying than going to MCDonalds that's for sure. These guys have me hooked! The salami on their hoagies is seriously the best deli meat I've ever eaten! Really hope they put buffalo wings and a buffalo chicken hoagie on the menu! Really can't say enough good things about these guys and their amazing service and food. So lucky to have this place in the Clarkson / Port credit area!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time tonight and I am very impressed. Their pizza was everything I ask for in a pizza: crispy (no soggy centre!!), thin, airy crust, good sauce, and fresh toppings! The staff here was so pleasant and chatted with us about good local venues, they actually cared about making the pizza the way the customer likes it. He made sure to show us the pizza to see if it was as well done as we prefer.  I did a personalized pizza with green olives, saut√©ed onions and roasted red peppers and the boyfriend got the Big Marc. Even though I don't eat meat his pizza look so good and apparently tasted even better. I swear they perfected doing a crust that doesn't get soggy in the middle, that is my biggest pizza letdown. Obviously I am very happy we went here, definitely recommend and looking forward to going back, especially in the summer to get takeout and eat down in the park!"}
{"text":"Couldn't be bothered to drive all the way to Dufferin and St Clair to my favourite pizza place so I tried local. Friendly staff, excellent crust and good flavour. More of a sit down area might be nice. The location and parking is more than offset by the quality of the pizza. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices.  Being outside of Port Credit rent keeps food prices down a little.  Food is much better then pizza joint food.  Give them a try.  I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! 5* for the pizza without doubt. 
The hoagies were well made and the steak and chicken cooked perfectly but not all that flavorful. So 4* for that. 
The guy there was so nice and friendly and will make it to your liking. 
Will go again!!"}
{"text":"So this isn't about the food, made a special trip because of all the great reviews. Nothing seemed to go right. Parking sucks, if there's no spot to park in front there doesn't seem to be any place else to park. Walked in and immediately got a locals only vibe from the people in the place. When I'm finally greeted I'm told it's 35 - 40 minutes, they're busy. Now it seems like it's mostly a to go place so I'll accept that at face value. Once I say ok he says my cc machine is broken, I'm only taking cash."}
{"text":"I believe this may be the best pizza in Canada!  New Jersey pizza (the best style IMHO), this place is better than most NYC pizzerias.  Perfect paper thin crust, excellent sauce, cheese and toppings.  Cooked to perfection.  Perfect grease level.  I've been making pizza for 35 years at home, and trekking across North America trying pizza joints.  Welcome to my North American  top 10 Pizza Nostra, maybe top 4 or 5!  I've lived in Ontario since 1980 and had pretty much given up hope of a pizza joint here who actually got it, these guys get it.  Can't wait to go back!  Staff was excellent too.  Very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"First of all, location is very weird.  It's located along a strip of Lakeshore, in between Port Credit and Clarkson.  And I believe, that the majority of their business is local as there is no parking lot and only stool seating.

Pizza Nostra is primarily pick-up, as opposed to dine-in.  I could be wrong, but I don't think they're big enough to do delivery.

Quality though is GOOD, especially the texture of the dough which is 50% of what makes a good pizza.  This pizza was MUCH BETTER than a busy, sit down place that I recently visited, down the road... 

Pizza is NOT cheap though.  Just check out their online menu to get an idea.  Personal pizzas are around $15 and I ate about 2 pieces in one sitting.  Pizza is crispy, thin crust, and it wasn't soggy in the middle.  Best enjoyed fresh, so don't wait too long before you dig in!  It was definitely neither greasy nor too bready.  

Again, too bad it's in a location that it is.  I believe this place would do much better if it was located more centrally, had some seating, and more importantly, parking!"}
{"text":"We get their margarita pizza all the time! Their dough is thin, tastes great, and has a nice chewy texture. I also like how consistent it is each time! Thanks for making great pizza. Margarita pizza is my fav. We used to go to earls square one for their margarita pizza but since they got rid of it we have been looking for another place in Mississauga for great margarita pizza."}
{"text":"Another amazing pizza from Pizza Nostra! Highly recommend! Sauce is perfection as well as the crust! Fresh topping! Soooo good!"}
