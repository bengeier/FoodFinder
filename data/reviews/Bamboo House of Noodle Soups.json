{"text":"One of the main reasons why I give this place only one star is because there was so little 'meat' in my pho. We ordered a seafood pho and a beef pho. For the amount of money paid, there was waaay too little meat. My seafood soup had exactly 3 rubbery, overcooked, tasteless shrimp in it. Not to mention the mystery meat bits which were supposed to be crab meat.   Definitely is not an authentic Vietnamese place.   Oh and c'mon, where's the banh mi?!"}
{"text":"We've been going here for years and Bamboo House of Noodles has consistently good food and service.  We appreciate the variety in dishes according to true VN regional differences in ingredients and presentation.    We always ask for extra herbs and limes, having eaten in VietNam and really loving the Pho from Saigon with loads of herbs in it . . . they don't hesitate to bring extras. Stellar tastes:  Clay Pot, Summer Rolls, All the Noodle dishes, Bahn Beo.   The condiments are tasty and some are house made.  The hot limeade is so good that we buy extra if we are under the weather just because it makes a cold feel better :) I always get enough to take a little away for lunch the next day.  Yum. AND, IT'S BYOB!  Yay!   Wish they would put Bahn Mi on the menu --- maybe I'll ask next time we go :)"}
{"text":"American version of Vietnamese food. Even their items have name changes.  I like the atmosphere and decor of the place.  It's pretty full during the lunch time that I stopped by here but we were quickly seated and served.   Chicken Noodle Soup $8.50 ... Chicken Pho ... but when it came out, it looked bland and empty. Other places have a lot more meat and veggies in this. I don't remember seeing any veggie in this.  Rock 'n Roll Beef $16 is their version of Bo Luc Lac. I kind of guessed it from the name and description but asked to make sure anyways. They make it with lemon grass here and put it on lettuce. You also have the option of white or brown rice - first time I had brown rice with this but it was pretty good. The beef was also very juicy."}
{"text":"Has been a favorite of mine, family, and co-workers for years.    I've tried nearly everything on the very extensive menu and never been disappointed.  The chicken clay pot is my go-to dish, and they're happy to adjust the spice level to your tastes.  Generally recommend the Bamboo special to first timers for Vietnamese, and have never had someone not want to go back.  Great place - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 2 1/2 stars if Yelp allowed me, but I'll go with the 3 since they deserve more than 2, if for no other reason I was in and out quickly.  Came here because I was jonesing for pho, and this is pretty much the only place anywhere close I can get it. As with any new Vietnamese place, I always order the same thing - Summer Rolls and Pho. This is a very Americanized joint, there was silverware on the table! And the menu was in English. The server actually verified with me I wanted the \"uncooked\" rolls (I should have just ordered in Vietnamese). I mean, ok, I get she wanted to make sure I got the right thing, but for some reason it annoyed me.   Summer rolls - I'll give these three stars. They were smaller than any other place I've been to, didn't have lemon grass, and could have been rolled tighter. But, they hit the spot, and did have the shrimp and pork, so I'd consider getting them again.  Bamboo Pho - what a disappointment. I'll give it 1.5/2 stars. First off, for $10, I expect a decent sized bowl. Nope, not here. It was, at best, a small from any legit pho place. Then, there was hardly any meat in it. One cut up meat ball, two slices of brisket (which were cut WAYYYYYY too thick), a little bit of tendon and tripe. The broth lacked any sort of depth, missing the distinct star anise notes I was hoping for. It was piping hot, so points for that. The odd rim of the bowl made it difficult to work my chopsticks and spoon in conjunction with each other. The sauces were served in four little containers with spoons, instead of in the squirt bottles, which was cumbersome. And perhaps the most egregious error - the hoisin was that nasty, corn syrup-y garbage from Lee Kum Kee. No self-respecting Asian restaurant serves that!! The jarred stuff that is thick and rich would have really helped out the lacking pho, but I skipped it entirely because the slimy stuff is just unpalatable for me.   That being said, I would potentially return to try other things on the menu, but I would definitely skip the pho. It's just not worth it, and for what you get, it's way overpriced.  I will say the décor was nice, service was decent (a little standoffish but I can deal with that), and I was there probably a total of 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I bought a gift card here and used it to take friends out. When I paid for the meal, Bamboo managers told me they couldn't honor the gift card, IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS. It seems THEIR computer system erased 6 months of THEIR records for gift cards, and they acted as if I were a criminal trying to steal something, as opposed to a customer paying for BAMBOO'S MISTAKE.   LUCKILY, I HAD THE RECEIPT for the gift card and drove it to them the next day.   This restaurant is UNINTERESTED IN SERVICE. They are unapologetically INEPT and RUDE, and their over-sauced food was NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT.   Seriously? GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!! (And enjoy!)"}
{"text":"In our eternal quest to get decent Pho noodle, we went to Bamboo house. We have only been able to find 2 pho noodle shops so far in the Exton area. We both ordered Pho noodle and found the taste itself wasn't the traditional Pho that we were not used to. The other place in Exton was the same. Very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Bamboo is a good Vietnamese restaurant. The noodles soups are really large and the stir-fry dishes are good as well. Vegetarian eggplant and various curry dishes are done well here. However, their prices are a little high.  My disappointment with Bamboo is the service. It is not good. The hostesses are particularly unfriendly and the waitresses are a no-show through much of your meal. This really sucks when you need more water or a condiment. When you finish your meal, waiting long periods of time for your check is the norm as well.  Other than the service and entrees that are $2-$3 too expensive, Bamboo's food is decent."}
{"text":"That was the greasiest bowl of pho I have ever consumed. I hope I don't get a heart attack."}
{"text":"This place is always excellent.  My favorites are Pho, Wonton Noodle (ask for udon noodles!).  My guests had the shrimp and chicken claypots and both said they were excellent."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch and we both ordered a noodle soup.  It was very tasty, but as some other reviewer said, I'd agree that the noodle-to-add-ins ratio was a little off. I had noodle soup with shrimp and there was very little shrimp, but massive amounts of noodles. The bean sprouts that you add in are a nice touch and make the texture more interesting, but a few more shrimp or some other veggies in the soup might have made it even better. I'd give it another try though."}
{"text":"Been coming here weekly for about four years.  Best chicken pho in the suburbs! Friendly wait staff, fresh delicious food and updated decor. Great for kids, too!"}
{"text":"Our family go-to restaurant. Everything delicious. Chicken w broken rice bits is so tasty! Hot and Sour so different (good) than the usual 'brown' variety. Meat rolls (like egg roll but not deep fried) are fantastic-we choose chicken, but can be beef, pork. Chicken w ginger also excellent. Love the vietnamese coffee or lime drink are favorites. Our kids love it. We go 3x per month!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time, for lunch, at the recommendation of friends. Big menu. Went with chicken fried rice. Sounds basic, but definitely didn't taste that way! I really enjoyed it, and look forward to returning to try some more meals.  Service was a little slow, but it was at the peak of lunch time. Prices seemed a big higher than I'm used to. However, the excellent meal I got, along with the nice atmosphere, will bring me back soon."}
{"text":"It was quite an adventure trying to find this place.  I'm not familiar with the area around my work but I yelped this place and came here for lunch with my coworker.  This restaurant is on the corner of a shopping plaza closer to Giant (supermarket), but google map definitely has it wrong location wise.   We both ordered pho and as always, pho came out in a matter of seconds after we ordered it.  The broth was flavorful and we both had the rib eye beef (it was cut too thick in my opinion) but still tasted good.  You can tell this place cater towards americans.  I say that because I'm use to the pho restaurants in philly where all the silverware and plates/bowls are not so fancy looking.  We also ordered the vietnamese coffee which was very good (just the right amount of condense milk with the coffee).  There are some other dishes on the menu that I would like to try and would definitely come back again. As for the service, can't speak much about it because we were pretty much in and out in a matter of 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant that I've ever walked out on.  Why?  I ordered a pho here once and waited for an hour.  After running out of patience and asking the waiter what the problem was, all the explanation I got was that it would just a little longer.  I walked out of the restaurant at this point and have not gone back since, even though this restaurant is close to my residence and I'm a pho junkie....  P.S.:  I now go to Pho Ha in Philadelphia (Washington and 6th) or Pho Thai Nam in East Norriton for my pho fix."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here tonight, I ordered the bamboo special with chicken.  Fresh and light.  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Totally fine place. They have a nice, harmoniously decorated interior and keep the music easy-listening. The staff is friendly, but can end up rushed at times. The food is good: salty, large bowls of pho and other soups/stews. It's also BYOB, which is nice. However, I consider this more of a \"lunch\" location rather than a proper dinner venue, as everything is quickly paced."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I even came back 2 more times hoping that the next time would be better than the last. Well tonight was the last time. The food here is just average at best. Way over priced for what you get. I understand that they probably some overhead so have to charge more, but then at least make the food taste better and/or provide bigger portions. Tonight my wife and daughter each ordered pho and yet the broth in each bowl tasted completely different. One tasted okay but the other was pretty awful, almost like it was spoiled. Shouldn't they taste the same and if they came from the same pot? Or did they not come from the same pot and were cooked with crappy pho bullion cubes? Another disappointing suburban Vietnamese restaurant. For good Vietnamese, guess I still have to trek to Washington Ave in Philly."}
{"text":"Always good for standard Vietnamese.  The pho is ok, not great...but hey this is not a pho restaurant.  Service is attentive,  and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Great beef stew noodles.  No the service isn't great but I think the food is. It's cheap and flavorful. That's all I want."}
{"text":"In my attempt to eat at every little Asian eatery on the main line, I ran into this little gem. It's a Vietnamese byo that has a pretty robust menu for the places I've been to so far. I got a noodle soup that was really good.  It seems this is a great family place, and was pretty filled up even for an off night. I would recommend this as a good place to meet up with friends who like Vietnamese foods."}
{"text":"For being out in the suburbs, this is a good spot for those seeking something different. Bamboo serves Vietnamese fare as well as Chinese fare.  I've been countless times and tried quiet a few dishes. The Pho is so-so. The soup stock is very bland. The Bamboo Special (which I always got with scallops) is good and very filling. The Claypot entrees were ok. For those who like their food really spicy, ask the server to have the claypot extra spicy, as the default level is barely a kick. The one time I tried the Claypot with tofu, I regretted. Instead of soft tofu which I was expecting, the tofu was fried and very tough to chew. The spring rolls were ok and the summer rolls were really nice, as it came unfried and with hoisin/plum sauce.  I always went with a group during lunch and if you aren't there before 11:45am, the place would be packed and service is extremely slow. I wouldn't recommend this for groups as some of our order was always missing or wrong.  The only item that kept bringing us back is the Young Coconut Juice. I suspect it is just canned coconut juice poured over ice with canned slices of coconut in it (all pieces were too evenly cut). Regardless, it was good."}
{"text":"THE Vietnamese place I go to when I am craving for Vietnamese food at home. It's pretty decent considering it's in suburb. Ofcourse the general price is higher than philly but you still get pretty authentic food from what I can tell. I love their beef pho and summer roles (They put both shrimp and pork in!) I did dine in for dinner and takeout before. Nothing special to say about their dine-in service. For takeout, they are pretty fast and it took them 15 minutes to get my food ready last time."}
{"text":"Had a good soup - chicken stock with shrimp.  Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I grew up in the area so I've been coming here for years. The taste and quality of the food is great! Definitely get their summer rolls for an appetizer :) The only negative thing I will say is that sometimes they are inconsistent with flavors. Sometimes my soup is saltier than other days."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went there for dinner yesterday. We are new to the area and there aren't very many options for Asian food. Hubby order the regular Pho and added chicken.  He also asked to add Shrimp-- and the rude server asked how many???  apparently they charge per shrimp! $1 per shrimp that is...Really?? Who does that?  I looked at my husband and wanted to burst out laughing because knowing him, he would have asked for 47 shrimp or something ridiculous. lol. I'm happy to report that he just said ,\" no thank you.\"  Other than that... food was just ok. I've had better. Service was pretty quick as it should be.. They probably just have a huge pot of broth ready and all they really had to do was cook the noodles and meat.  I really wasn't impressed. If the server were a little more warm and welcoming we might be more inclined to be regulars."}
{"text":"My husband and i came here for a late lunch/early dinner and we were both so happy we did. Their Thai Iced Tea was sweet and delicious. He had a spicy crab pho soup which was not overly spicy and really fragrant in a good way. I had the short run and rice dish which i will definitely get again. The meat was super flavorful!! I can't wait to come here again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"There is no good asian food in the area besides Bamboo which I find myself at 1-2 times a week during a 3 night stay in Philly area due to work. The pho is great here with the sauces and service. Pretty cheap (under 10 in this area...yes I know it is a lot cheaper on west coast or where there actually viet people). Summer rolls are solid...spring rolls are meh. The spicy udon dish was not that good and not sure why people would order it. The rest of the meals were def more pricy for asian good They have hot soy milk and thai ice tea, but I wish they had boba or more desserts in general. They do fast takeout, are open to the last min and often longer, dinner starts at 5pm...what else? they do not accept american exress."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat anywhere.  Chicken Clay Pot every time.  Vegetarian summer rolls are awesome."}
{"text":"First time here, the server was very helpful. Got the bamboo pho and summer rolls. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Bamboo has good tasty food but the quantity is so very less that's really disappointing. Also the price do not justify the quantity served. service is good and ambiance is alright but not impressive."}
{"text":"You usually don't find places this good in strip malls, but there it is. A friend of mine frequents this place and raves about it, so we went there a few months ago.  I've been here a couple of times since and gotten the same thing each time. The Clay Pot. You should too. It's a delicious combination of Asian vegetables and your choice of protein simmered in a spicy broth of indescribable complexity. It comes with a side of white rice that you slowly fold into the dish. In addition, it's accompanied by stuff like sriracha, Kimchi, peanut sauce, etc. Exceptionally good  You can get it at 3 different spice levels. Don't underestimate spicy the hot level is. It borders on painful. You'll pay for it the next day. But definitely stop here if you're in the suburbs looking for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"When you don't want to drive into the city for great Vietnamese food, this place will suffice. The food just doesn't measure up to those in Philly.   As it's at just beyond the Main Line, don't expect the bargain prices you'll see downtown. The limeade is great , however!"}
{"text":"Really a 2.5-star, but due to lack of competitors in the area, I rounded it up.  Since \"Noodle Soups\" translate back to Pho, we had mostly Pho here.  Along with some other items.  Going through the list everything is at most average:  Spring Rolls - 4 stars.  Nothing to write home about, but at consistently decent.    Summer Rolls -  4 stars.  Same reason above.  Pho(s) - 3 stars.  My default is the Bamboo Pho. Which comes with all kinds of beef (tendon, tripe, flank, meatball, eye round).  I've also had the Seafood Pho and Tofu Pho (both streamed and fried).  They all have the same problems.  The broth is on the weak side. The noodles are clearly not fresh because half of the time they stick together and it's work to pull them apart.  I would also expect more meat in the beef and seafood phos for the prices they charge.  Papaya salad - 3 stars.  They could really put more beef jerky and shred the papaya a little thiner.  The flavor would've been much better.  The biggest problem I have is their 1-star service.  I get it that they're packed during lunch time, but we've experienced 6 people waiting for 10 minutes without anyone come over to greet us or bring us water.  The waitresses' faces are so unhappy sometimes that I want to tell them \"Honey, it doesn't hurt to smile a little\"!  Oh and they're closed between 2-5pm during weekdays so I have no choice but taking the  \"I'm stuck here serving you\" faces."}
{"text":"I and my husband have dined here several times. The ambience and food are good.. what we don't like is their service and arrogant waiters. They were never pleasant and it always annoyed the way they used to treat and unpleasantness in their faces. Even though food is good we will never ever go there as we don't want to spoil our evenings with their rudeness and their grumpiness."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, but the broth was only okay. It could use some work. Maybe the sister store will be better. Definitely needs a little more flavor it wasn't as beefy as it could be."}
{"text":"Had some decent choices for food, but nothing really stood out for me here. The prices are a bit higher compared to other Vietnamese places I've been to."}
{"text":"The pho and spring rolls were so-so, but the presentation and tidiness would have deserved more stars. But, the second I sat down at 9:15, I was reminded repeatedly that they close @10.  The waitress was so rude that while I still had food in my mouth, she asked whether I would be done in 10 mins. I looked around, there were still 4-5 tables working on their meals. If they really need to enforce the 10:00 closing time, perhaps they should not seat anyone after 9.  I, myself worked in restaurant industry for many years and dislike late customers.  But, is it necessary to remind the customer non-stop while they are eating? Entire meal was rushed and pho was served without chopsticks...  Owner, you do have a decent place, but that short waitress's gotta go!!!"}
{"text":"My go to spot for pho and summer rolls in the area. SOOO flavorful!  It's definitely the best you can get in this area."}
{"text":"Over priced Pho noodle soup.  Went there for lunch with a friend. Ordered beef Pho noodle soup. It showed up with rice noodle, some veggie and 6 thin slices of beef in about 1.5 inch square. The broth was ok, the beef was well well done with a few slice of onion floating around before I dumped in the bean sprout and basil. The bill came in a little over $10 including tax is a ripoff even in the suburb. The service was fast and that's the only good part for my lunch. Got to find some place better."}
{"text":"Food was very good, it hit the spot. Can't wait to return for the Pho, and other Thai dishes!"}
{"text":"Decent pho.  The service is somewhat rushed, but that's okay when I'm in there for a lunch during the work week.    It's much nicer now that they did a partial renovation.  The new tile floor and reupholstered seating was much needed.  Now they just need to clean up the ceiling tiles and light fixtures and it will look like a modern restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our visit here and cannot wait to go back!!!  The decor in this place is awesome first of all. I love the colors and layout, It has a very cozy vibe. We were seated quickly and ordered water and Jasmine tea. I love Jasmine tea.  So, I didn't need to look at the menu - I knew what I wanted. Bamboo Pho (which is the tendon, beef ball, brisket awesomeness I came for) My Husband chose a seafood noodle soup with rice noodles. We also got the friend won ton. It was all delicious, it came out quickly and hot. Our waiter was super nice also.  Overall, it doesn't look like much from the outside- but it is a super comfy place to fill that need in your stomach and heart for Pho.  I really enjoyed it and I think you will too."}
{"text":"getting seated is never a problem.  they have a pretty big dining area in the back to accommodate large parties and events.  there arent a lot of vietnamese noodle houses in the area.  their pho is pretty good but not the best.  sometimes, i find their noodles to be clumped together and not as fresh.  their sampler rolls for appetizer is good, there's a nice variety of things to try.  the atmosphere is comfortable.  their service can be a bit faster and their prices are ok and maybe a tad high for most.  i would go back just because there arent much options in the area.  they're avg. for pho noodle house type restaurant."}
{"text":"Who says you can't find good Vietnamese food outside of Philadelphia? While Bamboo's prices are adjusted for local clientele (i.e. higher \"suburban\" prices), their food isn't watered down at all. My Vietnamese friends who have tried this place agree that their cuisine is tasty and authentic. I love getting a big bowl of their pho, with a aromatic beef broth and fixings on the side (bean sprouts, green peppers, and mint leaves).  Servers (Kim and Rachel) have been great the times we've gone! I've visited here with parties as small as two and as large as ten and they haven't skipped a beat.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I never make yelp reviews but this place warranted one.   Went here for takeout. The woman at the counter was the most rude woman I have ever encountered at a restaurant. When we asked her questions she gave us attitude and laughed at us...we're the ones giving you our money, so you probably should be a little more polite.   Portions were RIDICULOUSLY small. I was in shock! Especially for how much we paid. For 3 basic items we paid $40, and the amount we got was worth $20 at most. I am not a picky person about food, but I was truly in shock at how bad this whole experience was.  I will NEVER be back here again, and I would never recommend this to anyone. Pricey, rude, worst portions I've encountered EVER, average food. Wouldn't even give it one star."}
{"text":"Went there a LONG time ago and was simply neutral rating, nothing special.  Went back twice recently and both times was a little lacking in meat-vs-soup content.  The big thing that turned me off after last experience was my friend was allergic to shellfish and got some in his noodle soup.  It wasn't obvious on the menu, so lets let that part slide, but when we pointed this out the waiter was so inept and/or didn't understand English, offered to ask the chef to \"add more chicken\".  When I explained to him that \"this will KILL him\", it didnt seem to register nor did he apologize.  He did get his manager who was still a little too \"so whats the big deal\".  In the end they tried to make it right with another dish.  My dish had to be sent back because there was some extra ingredient \"that they always put in\", but wasn't on the menu listing.  Once again, it was a \"whats the big deal\" situation, and I was like, its not on the menu/not what I was expecting.    Overall, the place would be pretty good if they: A. Improved their customer communication and service.  I am not asking for picture-perfect English, but basics like \"allergic\" or \"this will kill him\" should be understood B. Increased the meat content (or offered some paid option to add extra meat)  Until these things change, only go if you are desperate for some Vietnamese in the middle of suburbia."}
{"text":"(3.5) ~ Good overall food & service  OUR MENU: ** Iced Vietnamese Coffee = (4) very good ** Lime Juice(cold) = (4) very good * Water(tap) = (3.5) good * Spring Rolls = (3.5) good * Bamboo Pho = (3.5) good * Summer Rolls = (3) ok"}
{"text":"We had dinner here and got there at the perfect time 6:00. The dinner rush came in immediately after we ordered our food. The decor is wonderful and tasteful. It's very clean and spacious on the inside. Our servers were very kind. The food was BOMB! We got the Quang Style Bahn Beo and they were so delicious! I got the Nam Vang and it was delicious simple clean flavors. My dad got their special of the night Chicken Curry Soup and it was the most flavorful, delicious soup I have ever eaten! The chicken was so tender! We were pleased with how quick everything was served and how fresh all the ingredients were. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere- Quiet and Zen  Food- I came here wanting Pho, but I didn't have a lot of options so I opted for Pan Friend Noodles and Fried Rice instead. The Pan Fried Noodles didn't have enough sauce, but they were delicious. The Fried Rice I tried had shrimp, pork, and chinese sausage (possibly my favorite combination ever) and was perfect. There was so much that I shared with my friend and brough leftovers to work the next day. We also tried the fried spring rolls and they were really good.   Price- Eh. Not too bad. I've eaten at better/cheaper Vietnamese restaurants, but there aren't many options in the area, so I guess they can get away with it.   Overall- Tasty and I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Really good food, and I thought the service was fine, although we went at around 8pm, when the restaurant was pretty slow.   My fiancé had the Bamboo Pho and loved it, and I had the Yellow Curry with shrimp. It was delicious, but a little too spicy for me. I powered through it because it was still tasty, but I'm pretty sure the servers were laughing at me! There were four levels of spice available (regular, medium, spicy, and extra spicy) and I asked for medium, but I obviously should've gone with regular. Medium is typically just right for me, but unlike most curries I've had, this one didn't have any coconut milk to cool it off.   The menu has a ton of options, and there's even a vegetarian section (but the items on there aren't very exciting). We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decent place for pho farther out on the Mainline.  My girlfriend and I both had the Bamboo Pho-- basically all the cuts of meat.  I was surprised at the low ratio of meat to noodle.  At first, it looked like plenty of tendon, tripe, brisket, flank, etc., but, it was just a small amount on a massive pile of rice noodle.  The flavors were fine but  not spectacular; however, the brisket stood out as being the best I've had in a soup ever.  A nice touch to the meal were the small covered dishes used for the types of sauces to add to the pho.    Overall, as far as pho is concerned, Bamboo is slightly pricier ($8-$9/bowl), but it's a good place if you're in the Paoli/Malvern/Frazer area.  If you're closer to Philadelphia, stick there as most places offer more for less money."}
{"text":"Nice portion sizes and prices. Everything is tasty and in a simple, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  I am from San Francisco and typically \"level-set\" myself when I eat asian food outside of big cities, but this place knows what's up.  I've only been here once, but the beef stew noodle soup I ordered (along with the bbq pork vermicelli I ordered to go) was muy excellente. The beef stew was very flavorful with had the rich flavors that make this dish one of my favorites.  The pork vermicelli left a bit to be desired but that's only when I compare it to some of my favorite places in San Francisco.   Overall, very good."}
{"text":"Love their broken rice pork chops! It is so addictive! You don't get Vietnamese like this in suburbs. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ambience is good! Summer rolls, thai entree and stir fry noodles taste very good. Pho and soup are not at all good. I did not like the vegetarian pho that I had ordered. Clay pot salmon is one of my favorite dishes here!"}
{"text":"The service is very good and fast.  We had the bamboo grill app for two and we each had pho. It was a great experience and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Anybody who gives this restaurant less than 5 stars needs to *seriously* get their head examined.  This is the single best restaurant in the tri-state area, hands down.  The chicken clay pot is the best dish I've ever ordered, anywhere, any time, any style, across the board.  I dare anyone to try the chicken clay pot here and argue otherwise.  It can be spicy, so be sure to specify how spicy you like your food."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night in a group of 10 people - and everyone enjoyed their meals, from Pho to Short Ribs."}
{"text":"We have JUST been bamboozled...see what I just did? I have never written a review before but I pray this helps someone. I'm a Vietnamese snob soooooo - and no I'm not Vietnamese. First of all too expensive for the quality. If you've never had it try it, I guess. OR you can take a trip to Huong Viet in Falls Church, VA for the real deal. Shrimp rolls were the only good thing, Pho was eh and the caramelized cod was watery and don't get me started on the bubble tea that wasn't really bubble tea."}
{"text":"The Duong Chau fried rice was an A+.   The bamboo pho was pretty good, an A-. Not as much meat as I would like. Wish there were an option for extra meat. There was almost no tripe, which was a disappointment. The tendon was excellent.  The yellow curry (we got scallops) was pretty bad. It was watery, didn't taste all that great, and had very few scallops. However, my wife really liked it, so maybe it's just a preference.  Their \"summer rolls\" are dominated by rice noodles, which makes them much less appealing than summer rolls I'm used to.  Props to the staff for being really accommodating and courteous while our kids were not on great behavior. Staff gets an A."}
{"text":"I ordered the pho with beef meat. It had all the correct recipe items for a typical pho but the broth was lacking.The broth was very oily and the flavor was lacking the beef taste."}
{"text":"A day before Thanksgiving, Jeff and I stopped here for lunch and it was really busy. I was only expecting one or two tables to be occupied from the outside, but it was almost full.   The wait for the food was a bit long, but since we had no where to go it didn't matter. I ordered the basic pho with chicken. The broth was very nice and it hit the spot.   Jeff got the birds nest with beef and broccoli. It looked exactly like a bird's nest! The crunchy noodles formed the nest and the beef was inside of it. This dish was also very nice. It had a lot of flavor without a lot of sauce. Also, the meat was cooked wonderfully and didn't look sketchy (does anyone else think take out Chinese beef looks a bit sketchy??)   Definitely worth eating at again!"}
{"text":"summer rolls were fresh- dipping sauce was tasty.  while we were eating this dish, we were interrupted.  see the ambience note for details.   we had the groovy seafood and rice vermicelli with chicken.   both dishes were very good.  everything tasted fresh and the veggies were crisp.   as far as the ambience is concerned, watch where you sit.  there are a few community bench type seats.  we had a family of three sit next to us.  unfortunately for us, the daughter who was around 10 yrs old let out an obnoxious 3 second fart.  i wish i could have returned fire, but i wasnt able to.  further to our right had one or two screaming kids."}
{"text":"The Pho experience here is very good. It is one of the best I have found in this area. It rivals what you find near Adams Avenue in Philadelphia.  The service seems to be a bit \"rough around the edges\". I came in for an early lunch (11:30 am) in this instance and I wished to sit next to the window. Because I was dining solo the hostess wanted to sit me in a small table (too close to the door). When I requested the window seat, she did not comply at first. When I insisted, she complied but gave me an attitude. It was weird. I could not believe she would do that. Her reason was that the restaurant gets busy for lunch...but at the time there was just me and another party at the restaurant. It was a disappointing occurence.  I did not see the hostess after that. A server never came either. The food came and it was as expected, but no other service was provided...no check to make sure I was \"doing okay\". Oh well, I did not need anything so it was fine.  I will give them another shot, but the service..."}
{"text":"Went here based on recommendations here on yelp.com.  Was pleasantly surprised to find that there were quite a few tables filled for a Wednesday night.  I had the beef stew noodle soup.  It was a perfect meal for a cool fall evening."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they took over the restaurant from Linh.  I've never had a bad meal, and hosted many family meals here. It's my favorite local Vietnamese restaurant. And I would disagree with many of the hypercritical people who did not enjoy this cuisine. I eat in Chinatown frequently, and would say that this food compares favorably with any of the Vietnamese restaurants there."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying Bamboo last weekend. being a Vietnamese restaurant and I absolutely love pho, of course I went for my favorite which is beef pho. I've had this dish in many places many times so i'm very familiar with how it should look an taste, but unfortunately, the pho I had at bamboo is my least favorite so far. The pho was greasy and I could see it through the broth which is not appealing. the beef was a little too rubbery and the broth itself didn't have as much flavor. I also tried my friend's fried noodles, which was good but also a little too greasy. I did notice they had a variety of noodles soups so i would still want to give it another chance and see if my review can change.  Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a busy Monday for lunch and the restaurant was very packed. Service was nothing to comment on due to how busy they are.   I was promptly seated and served water, but ordering took a bit. I ordered a glass noodle seafood soup since I was trying to have a light lunch. The broth was real chicken stock and was well flavored for normal diners. I needed more salt (I asked for fish sauce but I guess they didn't have any). The bowl of noodles smelled great due to the herb, raw onions, and roasted onion garnish combination. The seafood portioning did not reflect the higher price. Normally, an $11 seafood bowl of glass noodle soup is $8-9 in philly and you get almost double the portion. The glass noodles, imitation crab meat, and fish balls would've cost them $1.5 at most. I wasn't full, but I was content.  I paid and tipped at the counter since it was faster and more convenient."}
{"text":"Had a much better experience - this time for dinner - and the grilled beef summer rolls ($6.50) were so tasty and fresh.  Pho was average - but worked.  Broken rice platters are a good value. Friendly service and a fun experience."}
{"text":"I try pho all over the Philadelphia area and this spot in Exton is my favorite especially because they have a very flavorful beef pho (I hate a weak stock)!"}
{"text":"This is my local go-to for beef pho. Their pho is always consistently delicious, I'm happy I live so close to them. Like other reviewers have stated, it rivals what you find on Adams Ave in Philly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants. Food is always consistent and temperature hot. I often ask for menu recommendations to try something new. The servers know the menu very well and always recommend amazing entrees. Some of my favorites: Chicken Satay Vietnamese Soup Chicken Noodle Soup Shrimp rolls Bamboo Special Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch one day. Very, very surprised. Noodle Curry was excellent! Soup was a bit thin, they \"couldn't\" make it spicy and it was a pricey lunch, but very tasty, clean and good service."}
{"text":"We went for lunch a bit early with lots of errands today.  We were seated immediately, followed by the mad rush of lunch folks pouring into the place.  By the time we left, it was packed.  Bamboo Pho and Duong Chau Fried Rice were our selections.  Both very good, especially the Pho since they bring a variety of sauces to add to it should you want to increase the heat.  It was very good.  Nice staff, and good food, so I would have given it four stars..but the place itself needs some attention.  Our booth had a ripped cushion cover, and the floor looked a bit warn and hence probably a bit dirty too.  Other than that...great time and went away very full."}
{"text":"I've only gotten the chicken noodle soup, but I do love it.  I think they skimp in the noodles, so always ask for extra noodles.  Seems like average level pho, but I really enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was not up to par. The waitress didn't really check up on us while we waited for water, and later on the bill."}
{"text":"Food was okay a bit pricey for Pho. Service wasn't the friendliest but they were fast."}
{"text":"Pho was terrible.  They skimp so much on the meat!  I was done with all the meat and still had 75% of my noodles left.  They only offer one size.  $8 for regular bowl and $9 for a combination of meat.  Flavor was very underwhelming and broth was very greasy."}
{"text":"Love this spot, great for lunch ! The coffee bubble tea is delicious. The tofu pho is a must try !!"}
{"text":"Not as good as they used to be.  I went there a while back and ordered meatball pho the meat had a funny taste and smell. Went there again they didn't have bean sprouts which is needed to complete the dish. Went there again and the meatball pho had a weird taste to the meat.  The owner a woman is so rude. Just because we aren't Vietnamese doesnt mean we don't know good pho. We have been eating it from country to country and coast to coast. From Hawaii to Laos. I will never go there again And the peanut sauce for the rolls completely watery gross"}
{"text":"I go there solely for the pho.  Being from the midwest, I don't ever get anything close to decent.  I always get the bamboo pho which has a combination of meat cuts - flank steak, brisket, tripe, tendon, and exactly 2 half meatballs.  It looks like a decent amount of meat but I always find myself eating the last 3 or 4 mouthfuls of noodles with just the broth.    The veggies are good and what I typically expect - bean sprouts, lime, chili peppers, and basil leaves.  The price is a little higher than I've seen in Dallas where pho restaurants are plentiful; $8 to $9 vs $5 to $7.  Still looking for other places to try out."}
{"text":"I'll state this pretty basic and clear.  Prices here are consistently $2 to $3 higher per dish, or more, compared to other local Vietnamese places.   The fried sticky rice had a good flavor, but I wasn't wowed.   The wonton noodle soup with roasted pork, again decent flavor, but it should have more meat for $10 a bowl when competitors charge $7.95 for similar soup.   It's good. But I think you're paying their rent more than you're paying for their food."}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese if you're in the area, but not worth taking a special trip out to suburbia.  The pho is ok, but nothing special. I tried the brisket and tomato stew, which had a nice flavored broth but was light on the brisket. Unfortunately for me they were more generous with the chunks of brisket fat."}
{"text":"One of the decent Noodle Houses that I've been to in the last few months, Bamboo was a trip with a few co-workers for one of those 'corporate' lunches. It wasn't bad by any means, but I was expecting more in terms of the service.  The food was certainly very very good. The vegetable spring rolls were some of the best that I've ever had, and my Tofu Hot Pot was absolutely phenomenal. Truth be told, all 3 stars are probably due to the food alone.  Pricing isn't too bad - we were looking at apps and a dish per person for around 15-18 USD per person. Some items (fried rice) were as low as 9$, but my hot-pot made up for it with a moderate 14$.  Service was where it fell apart. I wasn't thrilled with the attitude of some of the servers from the get-go. They made it seem like I was doing them a favor by eating there. Granted, I'm helping pay your paycheck, but no, that's not how you treat a customer. Our particular server would wait around and do nothing, even when it was obvious that things were starting to get busy and the others were running around. Minimal refills of drinks, and waiting around and talking (which led to our food coming out cold) really got me peeved.  Long story short, if I ever go back - it'll be for takeout or else I'll specify which server, thank you. And yes, the food was that awesome that I would definitely consider going back..."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pho soup we eat here several times a month! Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Decent local Vietnamese - get the beef summer rolls - best special thing on the menu.  The pho is not that great.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"There are not too many Vietnamese restaurants in Chester county, so I was excited to learn that Bamboo opened up a location in the Westtown. They took over the old Shanghai Delight space and completely remodeled the interior to give it a nice modern look and feel. It's definitely not the kind of place you would expect to see in a strip mall, so I was pleasantly surprised.   Bamboo's menu on paper is a watered-down version compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Philadelphia, which makes sense considering the local clientele. I have been there twice so far and have only eaten the pho, fried sticky rice, and the Bamboo grill appetizer. The sticky rice and Bamboo grill (rice paper, cellophane noodles, and assorted meats/vegetables) were both delicious, however the pho is just average compared to the ones you can get downtown. All of the basic elements are there, but the broth lacks the depth of flavor that you usually see in a good bowl of pho.   The prices are reflective of the area, so plan on spending more than you typical Asian restaurant. Appetizers average around $6, entrees start at $8, and the drinks (soda, Thai iced tea, coconut juice, etc) are especially pricey at $2-$5.   Service here is adequate, and the servers are especially keen on educating diners about Vietnamese cuisine.   For me Bamboo's biggest appeal is it's location - only five minutes away from my house. The food and service are decent, and despite the relatively high prices I plan to eat here regularly and also try their takeout service. Granted, I will still venture all the way to Chinatown or South Philly for a really good bowl of pho, but for those instances where I need a quick fix Bamboo is right there!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to find Vietnamese food in the suburbs! Some coworkers and I had lunch here on Friday. We snagged a table around 11:45 and by 12 the place was packed. They were struggling a bit with only 2 waitresses and a man to help bring out the food.  Prices are a bit high, but that's expected. I ordered a bowl of beef meatball pho for $8. It was as big as a \"small\" bowl in Chinatown, and the broth was watered down. We didn't wait long for our food and drinks, but we had to wait for our credit cards after paying the check due to a misunderstanding. When out waitress picked up our check, she asked us, \"Are we good?\" We said yes, meaning, we were ready to pay, but she thought we meant that we had all paid with cash and didn't need change.  I have no substantial complaints, but I wasn't exactly wowed either. Compared to other places closer to the city, Bamboo is 3 stars at best. I'll probably return to try their other dishes, but they definitely need to work on improving their service. They seemed a bit short staffed."}
{"text":"I travel to this area for work quite often and I now make sure to book a room with a kitchen because I'd usually rather cook than scrounge for anything interesting or adventurous on the nearby menus. However, I'm incredibly glad I discovered this place. I dragged some co-workers in to try it one night and we ordered like 2 of every appetizer. Not all of them were huge hits, but no one disliked anything! Since then I've ordered takeout every visit and (understandably) it hasn't been quite as good, but still solid and much better than the usual burger/club sandwich/cheesesteak offerings at most places in the area."}
{"text":"Until coming here I never had Vietnamese food. There's always that uncertainty with trying a new food....Will I like it?...Will the flavors be too \"ethnic\" and unusual? Like a true American I ordered wonton soup. All I can say is wow! Just wow! I really can't wait to try more of the items on the menu. The broth tasted so delicious and had so many complex flavors. The wontons were so delicate, flavorful, and clearly homemade. The soup came with fresh sliced jalapeno and bean sprouts that rounded out the heat and texture."}
{"text":"They have a lot of dishes to choose from, it can be a little overwhelming but I ended up getting the beef stew with noodles and chicken skewers for appitizers.  The food was amazing, it was better than  I expected.  Def. coming back here and trying one of their clay pot dishes."}
{"text":"Food is decent. You can't get this kind of quality in the burbs. Compare Vietnamese restaurants in the city there are still some room for improvement. I like their broken rice dish it's always tasty. Thai Bubble tea is good too."}
{"text":"Has to be the best beef pho soup in the area! And affordable too. They are fast, the dining room is clean, the the staff are friendly. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and I really enjoyed my meal. I went during lunch but it didn't appear that they had lunch menus. I ordered the Bamboo special ($10.50) that consisted of a layer of shredded cabbage, plain rice noodles, seasoned chicken, with carrots/cucumbers on the side in addition to pieces of fried, spring rolls around. The more I ate my meal, the more I enjoyed it.   To my recollection, the service was good but I was also deep in conversation with my two girlfriends. The food definitely came out fast. I'm sure I will be back as this place is a fave for my co-workers that work in the area.."}
{"text":"This comes close to South Phily Viet! Just somewhat higher prices. Everything is fresh and flavorful, and the space is cozy and relaxing. Don't expect Washington Ave., but don't believe the gripey Yelpers either. Believe the delicious photos right here on Yelp!  Prices are getting a bit out of hand, though. $16.50 for pan fried noodles? PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good!  I've been frequenting this place for the last 3 years or so and I think that the pho is up to par.  I do have access to excellent pho in Philly's Chinatown section on a daily basis, and Bamboo does a pretty good job.  I usually do takeout, but have dined there once for lunch and once for dinner.  It has never been crowded when I'm there, but I think they do a brisk take out business.    My hubby gets the Beef Stew Noodle Soup, which has a tomato base and is spicy.  He loves it!  Bamboo also makes and sells their own spicy chili sauce (akin to Siracha, but much spicier and with red chili slices).  I am usually boring and order the same dish--the Chicken Pho--but I always like it.  I have also had the vegetable noodle soup, but I think the chicken pho is more flavorful. The Summer Rolls are quite generous.  One summer roll and a bowl of soup, and I'm done for the night.  It is also an excellent remedy for a head cold/flu.  A solid place to grab a warming bowl of soup and a no-frills, inexpensive dinner.    Closed on Sunday!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Bamboo by my parents when I was visiting them.  Top notch food, definitely fill the Vietnamese cravings.  The Bamboo Special and the Dumping/Noodle soup are the best.  I agree with Dave H. about the pricing but the flavor won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I love this place! The beef snd carrot soup is magical. The bamboo special dish is one of my favorites too."}
{"text":"Good menu, good food, good service.  Was pleased with the vermicelli dish I had.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service! The waitress displayed clear unhappiness about we only wanted two bowls of soup and no drinks or appetizer. She took our spicy sauces AWAY while we are still eating! I've been there many times. But today I brought a coworker and was completely embarrassed by the LOUSY service!!!!!!!! Plus the soup was just warm and our bean sprouts have no chance of being cooked!"}
{"text":"The pho was way to sweet and to much ginger. The Spring rolls were however excellent. Always find it funny when people rate the decor, which is very nice. it's about the food not the decor, Smh. Closed on Sunday's for some odd reason."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. The food is consistently fresh, healthy and tasty. #31 is our favorite hot soup especially on a cold day."}
