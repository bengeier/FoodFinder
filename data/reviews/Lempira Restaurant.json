{"text":"Never disappointed by the freshness and portion sizes. Definitely a place to share entrees. They also have great desserts!"}
{"text":"This time we went in and ate it was totally off. The food seem lack luster, missing the flavor of the dish it normally has. All of our dishes didn't have avacados on it, when asked why they said they were out of avacados. Yes, a Mexican running out of avacados. It actually happened. The ribs were full of fat and inedible. The seasoning was off. Will be a long time before I come back agaib"}
{"text":"BEST spanish food in Charlotte.  They have the best pupusas and the prices are reasonable.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever I order a California burrito my dish took for ever out of my groups order and was very burnt I just ate what I thought was safe very rude customer service but what do I expect from a place like this I should have turned around and left be warned"}
{"text":"The menu is HUGE and VERY diverse. Mexican, Honduran, and Salvadorean food. I have been there numerous times and everything I have ordered has been delicious, rich and POW!  I have left beyond stuffed. Like food coma. Hit the couch and immediately fall asleep.  The decor is very modern and upscale. Wait staff is polite, bilingual, very well groomed. Prices are reasonable. Central ave and Albemarle Rd. have tons of Mexican Restaurants that are top notch. This one ranks with the best AND it has plenty of the Honduran and Salvdorean dishes to boot. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. You know a place is authentic when English is not the first language you're greeted with. This place has a HUGE menu (like 6-10 pages huge) covering several ethnic divisions of cuisine. From Honduran, to Mexican, to Guatemalan, they have it all.  I have the whole fried fish and it was excellent. The plate was incredibly vibrant with bright flavors and colors. The veggies and fish tasted incredibly fresh. Word of advice though, watch out for those tiny fish ribs. They'll do a number on your mouth if you're not careful."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is among the best Latin American foods I've experienced. I am not going to subtract points for customer service, or for servers not speaking English. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? This is the reason WHY the food is so exceptional. Look, if you want the American experience of eating Mexican food, go to Taco Bell, or On the Border. But if  you want authentic, quality food that Latino people actually frequent on a regular basis, then this is it. My husband and I were taken aback when we were greeted in Spanish, and saw that the restaurant was full of Latin Americans, but it was a GOOD \"taken aback\"! LOL. What went through our minds was: \"Oh yes, we're in the right spot!\" And the food did not disappoint. If you're smug and are put off because you have to wait a few moments for them to bring and English-speaking host to seat you, then that's on you, but you're missing out!  :D"}
{"text":"Had the super nachos and added shrimp to them which were a dollar each. A total of 5 in an order which is pricey but didnt mind paying for. When i opened the box I found that all 5 shrimps were not cleaned at all which was disgusting. Also the beef used for the nachos seemed like the fatty bits not used when butchering beef. Very disappointing experience these nachos are very photogenic but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Really tasty authentic food.   Downside is they're painfully slow especially if you're white.  It's true.   And if you get take out.  Girl and I love the food though."}
{"text":"I read previous reviews and was a little hesitant......I read that the service was bad and slow. I did not have that experience!!! The service was excellent and I got my food in a reasonable time. My waitress was polite and all the staff seemed to be working very hard. The manager visited my table twice. The food was excellent, the portions were plentiful and the price is definitely going to have me come back!!! The presentation and flavor was amazing!!! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Was greeted & seated right away. Very attentive staff. They have beer and an assortment of tequila. Food was delicious and extremely fresh. Love the wide range of variety."}
{"text":"This is possibly the most on organized unsanitary restaurant I have ever been to and to top it all off when I need to order it took an hour and a half to get some chicken and it smells like monkey ass I tried to send it back and they kept saying that's how it is supposed to smell are you kidding me then the manager said to get over it so I took my food politely walked to the area upfront and drop the plate of monkey ass in the trash I would not recommend this to my worst enemy #ExWife"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service or almost none ,beside none of them seems to know what they doing!! No refills,rude cashier,won't even make an eye contact,this is the most clear example of crow of monkeys running a restaurant, save your time ,$$, aggravation and go somewhere else ."}
{"text":"Dos palabras: Me gusta."}
{"text":"L'Empira boasts the best authentic Latin American cuisine in the Central Ave. area. There a lot of similar restaurants within a mile of L'Empira, but L'Empira is by far the best. The food is very good. I've eaten here twice and my only complaint is that the chicken in the tamales had some bones in it. The rest of the food was very tasty. The portions are very generous and the presentation looks very nice. The attmosphere feels fancy, but the prices are very reasonable. Overall L'Empira provides an enjoyable eating experience and I am always glad I chose to go here."}
{"text":"Love the food! Always fresh, big plates, authentic.  Saturdays are busy, but it is not a fine dining place anyways"}
{"text":"Great food. Prices were fair, wish some items were cheaper. Only issue was that no one spoke English when I was there."}
{"text":"El servicio de la comida es fatal. Los cocineros no hacen la comida conforme llegan las ordenes. Les llevaron la comida a otros clientes que llegaron después de nosotros y luego nos llevaron parte de la comida y esperamos un buen rato por el resto. Hablé con la encargada y me salió un poco pesada y no pidió ni disculpas OJO.. Hay opciones...  The service was horrible. Orders are not prepared at in order. People that arrived later received their food first. The person in charge was arrogant and didn't even bother to apologize. Three tables that arrived after us received their food first and we had similar orders."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch and it was totally worth it. Large menu with plenty of options. Large portions and the food had alot of flavor. I will most definitely try again and will recommend others."}
{"text":"Had baleada 5 and it was really great and cheap. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Went there once wont go back again. Place was really smelly for one. The service was terrible lady didn't come around to give me a refill or ask if the food was ok she dissapeared! Then they don't even have a big selection of drinks. This place didn't amaze me."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I understand not everyone has to speak English but know and speak enough to take the right order. My friend ordered food and she brought out the wrong one and they still charged them for it. Brought our food out cold. The waitress attitude was awful and was more focused on her boyfriend being there than her customers. I usually have good experiences here but this was enough to make me look at other options."}
{"text":"I know that this restaurant gets a lot of bad reviews for their location and staff, but the food is EXCELLENT. Point to anything on the menu and you WILL be satisfied. I love that they serve you a huge quantity while charging very little. Lempira offers Central American plates from Mexican food to Salvadorian food. On this particular visit, I had the chicken flautas. Oh my goodness... They were AMAZING! The flautas were served with salad, sour cream, salsa, and avocado and were drenched in pink sauce. I do think they had a little too much sauce but I was fine with it. The location was not the prettiest but I will definitely overlook that with their amazing food."}
{"text":"Aparte de lentos las que tienen ahí están bien pendejadas. Según ella tomándome la orden y texteando al mismo tiempo y al salir mi comida resulta que se equivocaron que \"sorpresa\".y estando en mi casa me percaté que la carne estaba quemada.no vuelvo a regresar a este lugar debido a esta mala experiencia..."}
{"text":"We had the tamales de pollo & it was 4.5/5 for flavor & taste. We also had the baleada which was chicken, beans, avocado, Mexican cheese, sour cream which tasted like a perfect combo of savory & satisfying. The servers were polite, helpful & knowledgeable. They were intelligent in suggesting entrees in English. If you are a world traveler take a trip here!"}
{"text":"So we found this little treasure off of South Blvd, based solely on the awesome Yelp reviews.   We walked in and were greeted and seated right away. Chips and salsa were presented immediately and then we got our menus. I loved the menu...there were tons of pages and options...anything you could possibly want chicken, seafood, beef, steak and great  pictures under most all the dishes so you can see exactly what you will be getting which made me as a hungry and confused first timer very happy!   After some questions and review of the menu we finally ordered I opted for the lunch special, burritos and cream sauce.   Okay, first things first,I agree with the previous review portion size here is here is out of control!!! There were so many plates always coming out the kitchen loaded with tons of great food! I couldn't wait to get mine and I was not disappointed!  When my burritos arrived all I could get out was OMG! They were huge! Packed with delicious shredded chicken and rice... My favorite part of the dish was the sauce. It was so flavorful and had a very nice kick, but if you want to kick it up make sure to ask for some of the hot sauce from the kitchen, it's so freaking good!   Needless to say we both left stuffed and happy! This is a great place for some Mexican grub and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! Great value. Fresh and delicious :) I highly recommend this restaurant. My fiance and I will be making this a regular spot."}
{"text":"A huge menu with A LOT of options!  I don't know how the cooks can even keep up.  El Salvadorian, Mexican, Honduran, Tex-Mex, etc.....  As per service, it was ok at best, but we could probably blame some of that on the language barrier.  The diversity of this place.  Tons of food.  From Curry soup whole crab, to fajitas, to bacon wrapped or battered shrimp, the list goes on and on.  I had the fajitas and it was a very large portion of food.  They forgot my tortillas, but they eventually gave me some.  This isn't necessarily the cheapest of Mexican style places, but there are plenty of options under $10.  I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Really the place to go when you crave latin food. So many dishes to choose from. I had a chicken dish with jalapenos... Super intense flavor. The plantains were amazing! Great staff."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is probably the second best Honduran restaurant in the country (The first one is located in New Orleans). I moved to Charlotte a few months ago and being the true Honduran that I am, I was hoping to find a great restaurant that provided me with a good home cooked meal since momma isn't with me. Well, gotta tell ya' this place is it. By far, their food is waaaaay better than anything you can find in Miami, FL. \"Hey, Miami Honduran restaurants, take note.\" They offer Mexican and Salvadorean food, but since I'm not Mexican or Salvadorean, I can't speak for that cuisine but I would say that the Mexican/Salvadorean dishes were good. I love having breakfast/lunch/dinner at this place. The taste is very authentic and the service for the most part has always been great. The restaurant is clean and the staff has been friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, very authentic when it comes to taste as well. Out of all the Latin American cuisines I have found in Charlotte this is one of the best hands down. They serve dishes from Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador. A must try if you are in the mood for Latin food. Breakfast, lunch or dinner! Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"seated quickly,drink orders brought fast, with spicy and flavorful fresh made salsa hot thin crispy chips, waitress spoke some english, good for me foor was out of this world, just like Hondouras,"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 2 stars but the food was good. Staff was fairly inattentive, only checked on me once. Beer was not ice cold, and no draft selection. Food was pretty good. I can't remember the name of what I got but it was pork chops on top of a bed of typical Mexican restaurant salad fixings, shredded lettuce, tomato, with a side of white rice and refried beans and fried plantains which were good but some of them were dry and almost cold. Overall I would say meh, I've had better. Also the restaurant seems to be for Latino people not Americans. I did like that everything on the menu had a pic!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the service is terrible. Every time I go in there they look at us like we are bothering them. And they are just sitting there at the front. They also took for ever to bring my drink, and the table next to us order their drink after us and got it before we did."}
{"text":"The service was okay, the place is in an okay spot as well. The menu is about six pages long and the text is kind of hard to read but there is a lot to choose from. I liked my food. I ordered the \"Mexican Carne Asada\" The menu states the different type of meats and the sides they come with. The horchata was not my favorite."}
{"text":"The pupusas are terrific but the service is lousy. The food here is great with a great variety of Honduran, Salvadoran, and Mexican dishes. I tried pupusas and tamales here and the pupusas were great and the tamales de elote were average. My friend ordered a half chicken with plantains which he said was rather good. The portions are big and generally a good value for money. The service is rather lousy. I pointed out to the waitress that my friend was overcharged on the bill and she refused to correct it and was icy from then on. She wasn't terribly friendly to begin with but it was solid ice by the end. Oh well.... If you don't mind the service, the food is terrific."}
{"text":"They probably need to adjust their hours. Hours are showing That they are open until midnight. I was there at 11:37 pm and the doors were already locked. I just figure that most successful businesses, would at least adhere to the hours, that they set."}
{"text":"This was a good little mexican/salvadorian spot.. Personally have had better authentic food, but if i'm ever getting a craving for some good pupusas I can count on this place!"}
{"text":"Great menu selection would have given it a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the AC Unit, pretty warm eating lunch.  But overall I was extremely satisfied with my selection.  The El Salvador house special plate.  Coming from a cook. The food was made perfect.  Give it a try if you're looking for some Central American food."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best authentic tacos you  can get anywhere around Charlotte! Always full of flavor and the tortillas are homemade! They have a huuuuuuge menu! We usually get a Salvadorian Grilled Platter which includes Carne Asada, Grilled Chicken, Grilled Shrimp, Sausage, Pupusa, Plantains, Rice and Beans and a side salad, the platter is around $20 which we always share. We've been going consistently for a year so far. Our complaints usually are that they don't give you much ice in your water, we usually have to keep asking for more ice and they seem to always run out of avocado. The servers tell us the Owner gets too cheap with stocking enough avocado because it's expensive seems to be the constant explanation we get. Other than that, the food is always excellent!"}
{"text":"Lempira Restaurant on Eastway appears to be the sister to the one on South Blvd. I've passed it numerous time and have been curious; picked up a Restaurants.com gift certificate  and finally checked it out. It was a pleasant surprise and will be added to our rotation of the numerous Latin American places on Tryon.  The menu is large and diverse; it features Honduran and other central American cuisine, along with Mexican and a few Peruvian specialties. Everything is colorfully illustrated; the vastness of the menu was almost overwhelming.   The waitress brings out the ubiquitous chips and salsa which were just average; the salsa was kind of bland. And once you see how big the platters are, you wish you hadn't pigged out on the chips.  We started with two pupusa's; one with chicken and cheese and the other with broccoli. They were cheesy, hot and delicious. The platter also contained pickled red onions, a vinegary cabbage salad and some of the same salsa that came with the chips. The salsa worked better with the pupusa's than with the chips. The plate was beautifully laid out. Forgot to take a picture because we ate them so quickly.  Onto the main course;  these entrees are enormous! I can't remember the name of the dish I had, but it was on the Honduran page. For 9.99 I received an imposing amount of food. You can reference my second photo to see how much meat was on the platter, a mix of beef and pork with the skin on it, nicely seasoned. The center had some fresh salsa, cabbage salad with tomatoes on top and some more pickled onions. Finally there was boiled yucca and an empanada. There was plenty left for lunch the next day.   My husband had a dish off the specialties section. It featured beef and french fries that were covered with a light vegetable gravy. Seems odd but tasted great. There was also a salad, black beans, plantains and rice. For 11.99 it was a gargantuan amount of food that he was unable to finish. Check out the photo to get an idea of how much food it contained. Both of the entrees were impressively plated on square dishes; these were some of the most attractive looking presentations that I've seen outside of a Japanese restaurant.  Service was just ok. The waitress was very nice but we could have seen her more. They open at 8 am for breakfast; I'lll be trying that soon and will report back. Lempira is one of those unassuming places in kind of a grungy area of town that you may overlook;  but once you try you will return for the tasty food and excellent value."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and it's given me a good introduction to Honduran cuisine. I've had tacos al carbon, baleadas, and one of the breakfast plates. Overall the food here is tasty and provides an excellent value for the money, and I plan to come back here semi-regularly now that there's a Lynx station nearby."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Poor service. It took 30mins to get our check.  Not only that, we were charge $1 extra for adding egg on a baleada and extra for 3 drink refills.  We never got refills and were never told additional charges for those things. Waitress only stop one time to our table when she when to give us check..Will never come here again!"}
{"text":"I'm not an authority on Latin American food but it seems rather authentic to me. The staff is nice and they do have a few who can speak English. The menu has English translations which is also very helpful!!  We got the chicken flautas, chicken in a jalepeno cream sauce and the carna asada. The flautas were okay but you could really taste the lard in the tortillas. The Carna Asada was a little over cooked for sure but had a great taste. The chicken was delicious and was very spicy but yummy!! Neither of us were a fan of the tortillas that came with any of the dishes. We just could really taste the lard that they used which is not something either of us is used to. Over all though it's a decent little spot to check out and they are open late."}
{"text":"It is a bit if a pet peeve of mine when people tell me that a place serves \"latin\" food. That is the equivalent of being told \"asian\" food. It leaves me wondering...what type of asian? Is it Vietnamese? Chinese? Japanese?  Luckily, Lempira sells 3 different types of Latin: Mexican, Salvadorian and Honduran.   Short version: I've been there 2 times and ordered from there via Postmates and have been happy with the food each time. Go there! Even if you don't speak Spanish, the staff is friendly and will get you what you want. Parking is shared in a lot with Value Village and other establishments but usually always has some room. Very affordable and good portions. Like I said...go there!  Long version: In my past visits, I have shared a Lempira Special (which is a mixed grill or \"parrillada\"), Mexican Shrimp Ceviche and Carne Asada Tacos. All of those were good. I love getting the mixed grills because they bring lots of different meats to share amongst 2-3 people. I have also tried the pupusas which are like stuffed tortillas. They were ok; not the best pupusas I've ever had but, so far, the only ones I have come across in Charlotte.  They usually start you off with complimentary chips and salsa which are always fresh. Service is friendly but the attention seems to trail off once you ask for the tab. So much so that on both occasions of dining in we had to hunt down our waitress or ask the manager/owner to close out our tab for us.  Other than that, I would definitely return and recommend it. They have like a 14-16 page menu (check out my pics) so there is something for everyone.  Side note: If you are into healthy eating or consume a paleo diet...just a heads up...there are no vegetables to be ordered as sides except for avocados, fried green plantains or fried sweet plantains. There are no grilled mixed veggies or even broccoli. They do have a small mixed salad though."}
{"text":"Paul's YER (Yelp Elite Rating): 3 Stars.  Went here with my buddy Paul who raved about their Sunday brunch. Being part Salvadorean, he speaks Spanish so I felt like I had a crutch. Well thankfully I went with Paul because ENGLISH IS NOT SPOKEN IN THIS RESTAURANT!!! For all my fellow gringos out there bring a Spanish interpreter because you won't be able to order. I still am shocked about this but our waitress didn't speak a lick of English nor did I hear anyone else speaking any English except for me and my buddy Paul. I'm still quite shocked about this. So was Paul!  Down to the food. Well, that pesky Language barrier again. I was VERY clear in what I wanted. In fact, I POINTED TO THE MENU and said \"aqui.\" I don't care if she only spoke Farsi pointing to WHAT I wanted should have done the trick. Well guess what? She brought something totally different. Was it good? YES! Very good actually. Then my dish was supposed to come with Chorizo. It didn't. Thankfully my buddy Paul TRIED to communicate to her what was going on and after about 30 minutes a Chorizo finally came out.  What my friend Paul got was quite good as well. But he felt that his beef was over cooked. I tasted it and while I thought the flavors were excellent, it was clearly overdone.  We both enjoyed the food. But when nobody in the restaurant does NOT speak any ENGLISH in your own COUNTRY, then I do have an issue. I'm ALL for speaking another language. Both my parents \"Mother\" languages were not English either (Tagalog and Croatian). But they learned.  I really am befuddled at HOW they expect to have a THRIVING business when NO English is spoken there? I mean, it's GREAT that they cater to the Latin community for sure. But NO English? At all? Really? WTF?  That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite authentic restaurants in the city, flavorful and great portion size. There us a great selection of Mexican, Honduran and Salvadorian foods. The menu is extensive, definitely would try some new each time you go."}
{"text":"Wooooooooo this place is good! The size of the plates here are huggggggeeeeeee the flavor and the food is amazing! I'm not an expert on Hispanic foods to be honest with you I don't know what I'm ordering half the time but have been here 4 times and each time is as good as the last! Big plates! Lots of meat marinaded in a fantastic flavorful way and when I asked for hot sauce. They brought out this magical hellish sauce that nearly killed me but it was SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD I couldn't stop eating it til I was sweating and bleeding from my ears hahaha. Very delicious and sweet service, some of their English is terrible but hey I guess that makes it authentic haha great place! Will be back many more times! Gotta have that amazing hot sauce of their if u can deal with hot food  Bc it's really hot, seriously! Don't mess with it if u can't handle it. It will mess you up!!!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this restaurant, this location.   The food is consistently good and the service is consistently bad.  Every time I go, I swear I am never going back.   They get bad remarks for service and well deserved.   The management seems to think more servers are the solution.   More does not equate to better.  If they had 5 good/interested servers and they had a section and made money, the problem would be solved.   The kitchen seems well run except for the sanitation grade, 90.  The food comes out quickly and is consistent with the pictures.   It takes me about 6 months to get over each visit and then with high hopes, I try again.   The music sucks and it's always cold.  A real restaurant manager could fix this place quickly and it would be packed."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often. Food is always great. Service is ok! My favorite dish is taquitos but I've tried various menu items and everything is good! As far as service, sometimes it takes a while to get the food out waitresses aren't always very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the stuffed plantain and a pupusa. The pupusa was ok-good, and only left me craving a fantastic one from el pulgarcito de america. I didn't care for the meat in the stuffed plantain at all.  I also got a mango drink that was very good.  Service was very friendly, but also very inattentive, especially when it was time for the check.  If I were in my grandmother's little town with nothing, I would go back, but not in Charlotte where we have so many better choices."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot but i was a little disappointed because they don't do pupusas con frijoles y queso. :(((  They just have pupusas con queso and like two other choices. Other than that its cheap and they were really nice to me so i was happy."}
{"text":"As a regular in San Antonio, Houston, and Austin, I can assure you this is some of the most authentic Central and South Anerican food I have found in Charlotte.    My orders have always been for takeout, so no comment on the service.  However, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! We order food from here every Friday and their food is absolutely delicious! I have never been disappointed with anything i have ordered from here. I definitely recommend coming to eat here because the food is so so good. I promise you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.. waitress was only there to take order,  deliver food, and give check.  We sat there with no water for fifteen minutes.  Place was overstuffed with apathetic servers.  Plus food was just okay.  Do not go here."}
{"text":"Confusion.  You'll be seated directly under a speaker, next to the bathroom and have to ask to move somewhere else.  They're baffled.  Somebody asks you what you'd like to drink, then vanishes.  Somebody else asks and you ask what happened to the first person that asked.  No idea.  No \"Hello!  Welcome to Lempira!  How are today?  Have you been here before?\".   The food is okay.  Kinda normal chunks of meat, tortillas, gooey bean paste and stiff rice.    The check may or may not arrive.  You go pay at the counter and more confusion.  Where's the check?  What check?  You pay and get your change and there's no \"Thank you!  We hope you come back.  Have a nice day.\"  Just silence.    The flashing, multi-colored light show on the exterior and interior is pointless.  The staff needs to display some degree of warmth to customers."}
{"text":"Pesimo servicio. El resturante esta nuevo y bonito por fuera pero descuidado y sucio adentro. La comida estaba fria y malisima. La mesera estaba mas pendiente en estar platicando con las otras meseras que atender las mesas. Le pregunte varias veces por mas refresco y regresaba sin el. La carne asada estaba fria y chiclosa no me la pude comer y los platanos estaban quemados. No recomiendo este restaurante para nada. Mejor ve al Pulgarcito mejor comida servicio y calidad!"}
{"text":"I usually go the south Blvd location by arch dale but I found this one closer to my job so wanted to give it shot so far I tried the pupusas and they were very delicious they tasted better than the other location. The waiter nice and very friendly I will be coming back."}
{"text":"It should be a common courtesy to take care of your customers. Complete and underly disgusting service I received. I asked for a beverage I ended up not liking. Requested a new beverage and the waitress and I quote \" it's not my fault you don't like it\" a total shame. Never going back again."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure. I was not sure what to expect walking in but am so glad we checked this place out!  We tried several dishes; everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and authentic. The prices are fairly low and the portions are large. This is a great find."}
{"text":"Wow.  I called 3 times to place a to go order and was hung up on 3 times.  Thought the first two times may have been accidental, but on the 3rd try it became pretty apparent it was deliberate.  Would have liked to try the food, but it's already left a bad taste in my mouth..."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night......bad idea! I was just ordering food to go, so it shouldn't have been too bad. I ordered 2 pupusas....just 2! (And a small horchata)   Guess how long I had to wait....  50 whole minutes!   FIFTY MINUTES! For 2 little pupusas!   The lady who took my order would periodically look at me and she didn't speak a word to me. No reassurance that my food was on its way. I thought they forgot about my order. On top of that, after she gave me my food, I had to ask for my horchata. She asked me \"what size\"? She should have at least upgraded me to a large because of the long wait and for forgetting to give me my drink all together! Plus, I had to wait another 5 minutes to even get my drink! Ridiculous!!!   The pupusas were ok....not worth waiting that long, especially by myself!"}
{"text":"The food here is bursting with flavor and there is plenty of it. Sure you need to know some Spanish to place an order and ask for substitutions, bit we made it work.  The flavor trumps language barriers in my book!! Everything was cooked perfectly.  Muy bueno!! Muy delicioso!! Es verdad!!! (See my Spanish is limited but you get the point.)"}
{"text":"Terrible service new waitress seen me being young thinking probably I wasn't going to tip her or anything . So chose not to bring me chips and salsa . However , 3 different tables came in right after me and they got them . Never came to ask me if I was good or anything . Food was pretty good tho"}
{"text":"This was a mistake visit as my Restaurant.com coupon was for the Eastway Lempira Restaurant.  I decided to stay and enjoyed the best Texas Mixta Fajita meal ever.  Why 4 Stars??, I believe the waitress was afraid of me.  That said, I had to get up to get the check and have her prepare the takeout I discussed when placing my dine-in order.   The restaurant was very clean and appeared new inside.  It was the former San Remo restaurant location.    As I try and find the best local Mexican Fajita meal near where I live, my taste buds were elated as well as my sense of smell of food.  It was so delicious and had leftovers for the next days meal.  I ordered 3 chicken tacos for my friend who texted me it was \"so\" delicious as well.  Waitress and/or the front staff all make the difference of a pleasing visit.  I hope they can be more attentive to the patrons as the Chef (who you don't see) making this meal.  Hands UP to the Chef(s)!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've been living on this side of town for almost 6 years, and this is the first time I ate here. Only ordered the chicken flautas to go, and OMG,  it was so good!!! I haven't eaten these since I left NY, and it reminded me so much of this Mexican joint I used to always go to. It was just an appetizer but they add lettuce, tomatoes, onions and guacamole so you could easily have it for lunch or dinner. Ok, rant over. :-)"}
{"text":"Good food. But the language barrier is tough. Take someone with you that speaks Spanish."}
{"text":"The food here is so good I'm surprised that no one has written a review for this place ! I ordered take out but next time I'm dining in judging the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen everything looked delicious . I ordered the bean burrito stuffed with grilled veggies it came with rice, a salad and guacamole . The food was amazing and portions are huge so come hungry . The prices are reasonable and this place stays open late !"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican and Honduran food. The best I have found after touring the South Boulevard corridor. The lunch specials, 11-3 including weekends, is a steal. The portions are a crime... Take some home!  Ordered a tamale ($2) and plantain empanada (also just $2) as sides... Both were outstanding."}
{"text":"I have to say the food at this place is quite delicious, however, the service is absolutely terrible!!! The plates are HUGE and portions are generous. Just be prepared for your server to not be super peppy."}
{"text":"We were heading to The Burrito Factory (also delicious), but on Taco Tuesday, and Taco DAY, the line was out to the door. We saw Lempira next door and my daughter and I had never been, so we stopped in there, and were pleasantly surprised. She ordered the chicken tacos (3 large tacos) to go, and while we waited we decided to have a tasty Margarita in their little bar. The same lady waited on us at the door and behind the bar, and was extremely pleasant and friendly. We enjoyed our short visit very much, and look forward to returning with  group next time."}
{"text":"Really tasty, but maybe heavily salted. Huge portions. Crowded on a Saturday night, but no line. Great service."}
{"text":"The food is good and they do have a wide variety of options. I like their lunch specials and the fact that they are close to work. However, the service ranges from mediocre to horrible. They do acknowledge your there but they are not at all pleasant. One of the waitress is more polite than the others but will forget to serve you if a guy sits in her section. Maybe they don't think I'll tip because I'm a girl?"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Latin place on Central. The food is amazing and the service is always great.  We've been to a few places in the city and declared this our favorite today. We usually get one platter and share it. Today we got two lunch specials @ 7.99 each. We thought it would be a smaller serving and we would need two. We were wrong. It was enough for two.   You eat first with your eyes and their plate presentation gets the meal going. It makes you almost feel bad messing it up. Almost ;) As far as flavor profile, I didn't grow up eating authentic Latin food, so I can't say if this is like Abeula used to make. I can say, for my American palate, it's amazing. We've had the ranchero sauce on steak and the poblano sauce with a platter. Both were tasty and needed nothing extra. The beans are darker than I've seen, but tasty. They have the crumbly cheese too.   We always check what other people are ordering too and the shrimp fajitas were ridiculous. Piled up on the skillet. Empanadas look good and the fried plantains are dark and crispy looking. We eventually want to try everything, but the menu is like a newspaper. Many pages.   Their tea is great, they have glass bottle Mexican coke, and of course the Michelada's. Please try this place if you're looking for a new place!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service..  excellent food.. large portions..bring your appetite or share with a friend."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place; absolutely our favorite place for Central American food. We've honestly yet to find any dish that wasn't up to par. Service is not always easy if you don't speak Spanish, but they do just fine if you're patient. Don't be afraid to flag someone down, they're happy to help. You get so much food for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Just go to the South Blvd location. It's much bigger, the menu is larger, and the service is better. I gave the South Blvd location 5 stars. We go there all the time!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great. I went there alone. Still they charged me 18% gratuity and about 30% tip. That's 50% in addition to the bill. I ended up paying 30$ for my lunch."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The burrito was filled with Veg-All and the chili relleno was covered in too much cheese (and that's saying something).   The staff was friendly, though, and the price was right on.   They have a Honduran menu that looked interesting...maybe I'll give it a shot."}
{"text":"Siempre que vengo a este restaurante.. Apesta feo..y el servicio Es pecimo no nos atienden bien la mesera solo trae la comida y luego se olvida de uno.. Despues pides la cuenta y se tarda otra hora para traerte el check.. No volveria jamas a este lugar. MAL SERVICIO NO SE LOS RECOMIENDO U ES SIEMPRE QUE E VENIDO 15 veces NO ES SOLO HOy .. Pence que havian MEJORADO..."}
{"text":"Sorry to say that I am not as enamored with the place as other reviews.  Absolutely no one in the place spoke enough English to communicate - Even when I just pointed at the picture in the menu.  The young, - very young, waitress approached my table with a lollipop in her mouth and didn't even attempt to determine what I wanted, including a real live server.  They acted like they did not care one iota about me.  Maybe they didn't- and guess what , I don't care about coming back here either.  The food was not that good to feel the way they made me feel."}
{"text":"Great food, clean restaurant, & the menu is huge! Try Honduran dishes- they're to die for!"}
{"text":"Open late, full bar. Really good food. Everything I had was good, even the flan. Huge menu, great prices. My friend had the Guatemalan plate which was like $20 but it looked great( sausage, red beans and rice, chicken, shrimp, steak, plantains and a salad). I thought it was an awesome price. Some of the servers don't speak English. My first one didn't understand me but She had another server that could speak English wait on us. She could've been a little better about Checking on us more frequently, but I personally enjoy long dinners"}
{"text":"This an authentic food restaurant, from the moment you sit down you will know you going to enjoy this place. Try the Honduran parrillada and the baliadas, thus must have."}
{"text":"Me and my roommate came to this location tonight and were literally denied a table. We walked miles at 11 pm to find a restaurant still open and this was the only location. When we walked in a gentleman (who I assume was a waiter) looked at us up and down and chuckled and walked away. We waited in the foryer for several minutes and literally every employee walked by and just LOOKED at us. My roommate finally politely asked \"can we grab our own table or should we wait to be seated?\". The young lady at the counter wouldn't even respond. She asked again and her response was \"what are you guys here for?\". At the point she summoned over another young lady and they began speaking Spanish to each other.. I asked the other lady \"what time do you guys close?\" And her response was \"we're closed now.\" At that point I knew something was off. I chuckled and looked at my watch and asked \"well, it says you guys are open now and your lobby is packed, so you guys are closed now?\" She just starred at me. She literally didn't even respond. I hate pulling that card. I genuinely feel like we were literally denied a table because we were black and out of place. I'm so angry at this visit and will NEVER go back to this location, even though I'm obviously not wanted there any way. No harm done I guess."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing!!! This is a most if you love Mexican and Central American food!! Totally recommend it!! Service is great the food is on point!! Only problem will be to choose. They have a lot of great choices!! I personally love the chicken in cream!! But their steak is off the charts!! Great food and the price is great. Here you don't pay for what you get... But on the reverse of what this comment usually applies to... You get more then what you think you are paying for. Great food!! Great price!! Great service."}
{"text":"I come here on the regular, mostly for the lunch tacos. If you prefer authentic South American food over cheesy, mild, fatty Americanized SA food then you should enjoy this spot.   Lunch fajitas are great, salsa is a little too mild for me (I love La Unica's salsa verde)."}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying new places and my boyfriend loves Mexican so we thought we would venture out of our norm and try some place new.  This place has a huge menu and the prices range along with it. Their lunch prices are what you would expect but if you don't find what you want there you'll pay a premium for their dinner prices. They have Mexican, Honduras and other south/central American food.  The food was very good. Had great presentation, great flavor, and huge portions.  The staff was friendly but the food took a long time. I probably wouldn't have noticed if we had chips and salsa to munch on. Our drinks were never refilled even though they sat empty half way through our meal.  The highlight to any Mexican meal is the chips and salsa. Theirs ended up being very good but we didn't think they served any until we saw a near by table get some. At that point we already had our meals!"}
{"text":"Extensive menu. Modern decor. Food presentation was great and the food was delicious and flavorful. Nonetheless, the customer service fails. Our initial sever did not speak/comprehend English. When my friend asked for a Margarita the server repeatedly said \"No\" without any explanation and we concluded that they do not serve liquor. Due to the language barrier and server's inability to answer our questions about the menu, we received a new server. She arrived with an indifferent attitude and exhibited deplorable customer service skills. We ordered queso and the server returned to tell us that the cook said they had ran out and he wasn't going to make more because it was near closing. My friend ordered a fajita and a taco salad and instead received a fajita like taco salad. Upon my friend's inquiry about her fajita, the server went back and forth with her about the order instead of offering to correct it. When we were leaving, we did not receive a farewell greeting or thank you upon exit although there were three employees standing at the front entrance. Needless to say we will not be returning due to the poor customer service."}

{"text":"Their food is good when they get your order right. You actually get large portions and I always have leftovers. They just don't have enough English speaking staff for the non Spanish speaking customers."}
{"text":"This place might be challenging to really enjoy if you don't speak a little bit of Spanish. While the menu is in English and Spanish, I did a lot of translating between the waitress and my gringo boyfriend. ;)   Food here is fairly authentic and so, so cheap. It's hard to believe the amount of food you get for the price. Papusas & tamales for $2, huaraches for $4, tacos for $6... Incredible! Quality is pretty inconsistent -- some dishes are great and others below average. The same dish might even be great on one visit and not good the next.   Overall, worth a visit though, especially if you catch them on a good day! So, grab yourself a Spanish speaking friend and head to Lempira! I prefer weekend lunch when the place is full."}
{"text":"Big caveat here...I ate lunch here, however I believe this place is more geared towards the dinner crowd..Was kinda average...food was kinda bland...service was ok... Restaurant was relatively clean.   The food appeared to be upscale Mexican..whatever that means.  I think we were the only white folk there and the rest were Hispanic ..therefore a good sign for mex food.   I wasn't blown away by the service or taste of the food.  We had the shrimp and a steak quesadilla ...had a couple coffees and was $28 not including tip"}
{"text":"I came here for Christmas Day and the place was packed. I came and got sat down without a menu, which it was ok, but then our waiter (maxi) came and took our drink orders and never realized we didn't have menus. So then I went to ask for some. Later when we ordered we asked him if they still had the lunch special and he looked like he was rushing and said yes we have everything. So then we proceeded to order we got lunch fajitas and then for the young one with us we ordered chicken wings that were in the kids menu and fries. Even in the picture the chicken wings didn't have sauce on them so we assumed there was no sauce. When we ordered it, he never mentioned there benign hot sauce on them as a child was going to eat them. The food took a while and he was constantly running around the restaurant and not checking up on us except for once to tell us the food was almost ready. But the food didn't come out until 20 Minutes after that. When the food came out and we saw what was on the chicken wings we told the other waitress and she asked if he mentioned they had hot sauce and we said no, then then brought it back and made a new batch. Which I was thankful for, except they forgot the fries. We were a little fed up so we didn't care anymore. After that we are and the food was amazing. Best food I've tasted. He again didn't come back to check on us for a while even when we were done eating. Another waitress noticed we were done and asked if we were ok and then he came and shooed her away and we told him we wanted the check. He brought it to us and it was shocking. He charged us regular price for the fajitas and we asked him before we ordered if we could get lunch, and when I pointed this out to him, he then proceeded by saying that it included the tax when I saw it included in the bottom after the subtotal. After I told him that, he said no it's in there. Then he left and came back and said no I ordered the regular big ones for y'all not the lunch. I was getting ready to argue that when my father told me not to, that it was ok because he was so fed up with the service. We just paid it and left. (It didn't include the fried thank god which we never got but ordered) the food at this place is amazing but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Pros: food is authentic, big portions, fresh, and fast. Service is good and the place is always jumpin!  Negatives: with so many large families in there, babies crying, and creepy guys staring, it was hard to enjoy the food. Takeout next time- but don't let the negatives fear you because if you are looking for GOOD FRESH Mexican, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Probably not for the faint of heart. The old San Remo is a bustling latin-themed restaurant, and when I say latin-themed, I don't mean that there is salsa dancing or even a bunch of decorations around the windows to make you feel like you are getting some chips delivered when you sit down (though you will). No, this is a true latin destination - when we have have been, it has always been packed to the gills, and the music is loud, which means the patrons are always trying to talk over it. Not for those looking for a quiet romantic evening, to be sure.  The menu, as has been mentioned elsewhere, is large. Book large - probably 10+ pages. You can find fairly standard Mexican fare, as well as some other items from central/south America, so take your time (you may have plenty of time, as the service can be hit-or-miss, but they are friendly and generally speak good English).  Food that comes out is typically served quickly and has solid flavor, and you get plenty of it, but despite the somewhat slow service, they don't really encourage you to sit because there is almost always a line waiting for your spot."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is where it's at! Service was on point food was perfection. Well balanced and basically was like a party in my mouth. Needless to say I will be back often!!!"}
{"text":"Someone once told me that when you go to an ethnic restaurant and all the patrons are (insert ethnicity of restaurant you're at), then you know that it is good. That was certainly the case with this place. It was amazing. The pupusas are 5 star. We tried tacos and enchiladas and everything was fresh - even the tortillas were handmade and came with giant slice of avocado and salad.  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are only because the food was really good but the service truly is lacking at this place. We ordered a pupusa with queso and loroco. My mom ate a fourth of it when she noticed that it didn't have loroco. I guess she was hoping it was maybe clumped in the middle. It wasn't. She informed our waitress and she told my mom that unfortunately couldn't send it back as she had already started eating it. I said excuse me but why should she suck it up when it's your mistake. She continued to argue that there was nothing she could do. I told her can you please add another pupusa to the order please...it's $2 Damn dollars...my mom wants loroco, she's going to get loroco. When we got the check we noticed she charged both pupusas, ok fine. We were going to take it off her tip because of the rude attitude but we noticed that they automatically charged 18% tip because we were a large group of 6 adults and 1child. Well no wonder she didn't care, she already knew she was going to get the tip. When we were going to pay, my husband informed them of the terrible service and the attitude she gave my mother about having started to eat the pupusa.  He said it was fine, we'd pay the extra 2 dollars so my mom could eat what she wanted but the attitude was not appreciated. The waitress saw that my husband was complaining and came out of her way to argue that we had already eaten half of it. Um, no...Don't lie...it was a fourth! AND I'm paying for it so Damn right we're going to eat it. We weren't going to leave it there. Needless to say, inspect your food before you take a single bite from it if not you will be punished for their mistake. The food is good but i would never come back to this location. I will look for the other location that has better reviews before i step foot at this place again. We didn't expect them to discount the pupusa, we just wanted to inform them that if they're going to charge gratuity automatically the least you could do was provide good service which we weren't."}
{"text":"More Honduran than Mexican, forgive my categorization.  Lempira's menu is huge, HUGE, like Greek Diner scale with many typical Mexican delicacies (minus Mole), Chile Rellenos, Fajitas, Burritos, Burritos Suizas, etc. We went for pupusas but ended up with more - Boltanos, like an open-faced brekkie burrito, cheese, eggs, beans, avocado. Some sort of empanada wrapped entirely in plantain and deep fried, filled with some sort of rice pudding. Deserty. But delicious.  It can be a struggle to eat here if a) you don't speak a lot of spanish and b) if you're vegetarian, but both of those apply to me and I left very, very full. As we were poking at our various foods, enormous Platos Typicos were steadily streaming out of the kitchen, all large and enticing. Veggies will stick more to breakfast, empanadas, pupusas, and burritos. Be emphatic - some menu descriptions forget to mention ham, etc.  Ask for the spicy salsa when you sit, as their gringo Red is mucho boring. They also do Botela Coke - enough for two to share. 6 dollar lunch specials daily. Breakfast combos served all day long. Lots of wood and curved doorways. Neato."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now always with friends.  We always enjoy it.  The menu is so large I've never had the same thing twice and I've never been disappointed.  My family has been to Costa Rica and Honduras and we sought out some place to get authentic cuisine.  This is amazingly authentic.  We are usually the only Caucasians in the building and while we might turn a few heads we have always felt very welcome by the staff and the other patrons.  Be sure to find out what fruit juices they are serving that day and save room for some of the smoothest flan in Charlotte.  We are blessed to have a place like this in Charlotte where you can have a little international adventure with such a short drive."}
{"text":"Very good beef soup with rice and chicken tamales Honduras style. The restaurant needs wait staff who are skilled as the orders were not correct and the waitress did not understand Spanish or English well when it comes to questions about the menu. Frustrating"}
{"text":"I have three words for you that will change your (food-loving) life... CARNE ASADA TACOS...wait I have a couple more words for you too.. CHORIZO TACOS. Not just any ol' carne asada or chorizo tacos but the ones at Lempira...and not at just any Lempira (and Ive eaten at all of them except the one at Steele Creek ..I think ) but the ones at the South Blvd location. A couple things you should know about me first. ONE : I am not one to order tacos when I go to a south of american food spot. I know, its the authentic thing to do, which is usually what I'm all about but something in me needs cheese when the option is there. Oh and a chimichanga..and TWO: I can be a bit lazy at times so I am all about convenience. Why on earth would I drive 20 minutes to a location on South Blvd when there are 2 Lempiras within a 10 minute radius of my house?! the answer is simple. THREE: friggin' crazy good food trumps everything.  Im always so underwhelmed by tacos I've have at other comparable restaurants in town, and even when I've even had these exact \"Lempira\" tacos at the new Central Ave location (bleh) and at the Eastway location (runner up to South Blvd.) they aren't quite as good. Great homemade tortillas, meat is soooo tasty and top it off with a couple squeezes of lime that they provide you and the green salsa...yes. yes. yes. Just please don't go in there trying to get lettuce and cheese on your taco or complaining that the chorizo taco is greasy..its sausage fool, its supposed to be there and trust me its the best part.  So if you are still confused about what to order...here it is: the 3 tacos (at least) which will set you back a mere $6, with at least one carne asada and one chorizo. I usually go 2 CA and one chorizo because the chorizo is really rich. Get them as they come and do make sure they bring you the green salsa that goes with it. You're welcome ;)"}
{"text":"Really great food. Authentic. Cheaper than Morazan across the street for the same menu and more friendly. Very attentive staff."}
{"text":"I am blown away by how good this place is. The menu is massive and the prices are unbeatable, especially for the amount of food you get! Every detail, down to the slaw that comes with the papusas, all the sauces, the picked onions etc. are so delicious. I could DRINK the sauce that comes with the papusas. I came here last Sunday for lunch with my boyfriend and we both left feeling uncomfortably full for the rest of the day.. We shared 2 papusas (the pork ones are great), chicken fajitas, and a chile relleno dish. This is easily my new favorite place in town for Latin cuisine."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place anything less than one star, I would. As a server myself, this place gives the worst service I've ever had.  Servers do NOT speak English, and do NOT know their menu. Both my boyfriend and I are white- it is obvious that we were not their preferred patrons by the fact that we switched servers multiple times. Our first server left without a word to us- but visited her Spanish speaking party of four and introduced the new server to them.  My boyfriend ordered something simple- chicken, cheese, and rice. This is known at other Mexican places as \"arroz con pollo\" or, simply, ACP. Our (new) server just nodded and stared blankly. I ordered the chimichanga. For how horrible the service was, the food was not half bad- even though our food did not come out how it was ordered.   The place was filthy- it was dead, but they were sweeping up obviously old food and trash out from under tables. You would have thought they had just had a massive rush. It seemed very dirty- I am hoping my boyfriend and I won't get sick.   I had to walk up to get the check from the counter. I was afraid to pay by card for fear of having my number swiped- thankfully, I had enough cash on me to pay. Honestly, I was tempted to walk out. First time I've visited this place, and I will never return."}
{"text":"huuuge portions, and tasty food!  Just a heads up, most of the staff doesn't speak English, though the menu is in English and in Spanish so you can make a choice and then point if necessary. Even though members of our group speak Spanish fluently, our pale skin immediately sent the hostess for the English speaker on staff. Can't blame them, I guess, but in case she's not there when you are, you can still get a good meal!  As others have mentioned, the menu is fairly large, and encompasses a few different regions. We ordered everything from stuffed plantains to chicken and steak tacos to pinchos to a beautiful shrimp and fish dish, and some were accompanied by fantastic house made tortillas. I ordered the chicken pinchos. YUM! Perfectly cooked, a nice sauce, rice, salad, fried plantains, and a small odd shaped hot dog tasting thing (we've made our best guesses, but I'll just tell you it mostly tastes like a hot dog and looks like it went through a cookie cutter). I couldn't finish my large platter, and actually most people couldn't finish their plate. Hello, 4th meal!  We asked if they had any draft beer, she said \"yes\", but it was all from the bottle. Oh well. Pretty good service, jukebox, delicious food, I'm ready to go back!! CMYE?? (and pay at the counter on your way out)"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!  It seems as though they may not like \"my kind.\"  The establishment was opened, OPEN sign on and the website clearly states they close at 12am every night but the woman who looked a bit frightened (maybe it was my Black male friend who frightened her... He was the one paying and is a big tipper) The woman told me they were closed as I watched other patrons dining. I WILL NOT SUGGEST THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Great place and food. Atmosphere is family friendly. The horchata was pretty good. You definitely get a lot of food for your buck. Food definitely reminds me of home. Food is authentic and so is the place. English is not first language. Very much enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"Lempira is definitely a hidden gem on this side of town. The servers are all friendly, the menu is extensive and has something for everyone, and most importantly the food is always absolutely delicious. Everything is so fresh and flavorful & the prices are absurdly fair for the large portions provided.  Our faves are the tamales."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food is exceptional, prices are great, and the pictures on the menu are exactly what you'll get on your plate every single time."}
{"text":"I love this place.there is music playing + a jukebox, bar and big TVs. the menu has a variety of plates from Honduras & Mexico also some American.  Huge portions @great Price highly re comment it..& sure I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here for first time, I asked if they served chips and salsa... server said they were out. I asked again after food arrived and she said the same thing. The food was very good and affordable, but couldn't help but notice another larger party seated received a large bowl of chips and salsa... It rubbed me the wrong way. I don't understand why we were lied to? Plenty of other Mexican style places to eat on South Blvd, don't know if I will go back."}
{"text":"Lempira on Sharon lakes road actually owes me a star.  Silvia lacks basic customer service skills and she is most likely putting off tons of customers with how unpleasant and rude she is. I will never eat from this restaurant ever again.  Adios!"}
{"text":"Toda la comida esta rica .. solo las aguas frescas oh de sabor muy dulces mucha azúcar"}
{"text":"Man!!! This place is out of this earth!!! So flavorful and such huge portion! We ordered the huge combo appetizers, which is amazing by itself! So much varieties in one plate! Then shrimp fajitas and pork chop are both amazing too! Best pork chop in Charlotte! Will come back to explore more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Ordered one if the most simplest plates 'Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada' waited,...and waited my family finished eating before I even got my plate. By the time They brought the plate over everyone at my table were done eating, so I had to get it to go. One thing I hate the most is people messing around with my food. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken fajitas, enchiladas, and papusas everything was great!!! Lots of food for the money. Papusas were the best in town!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken Fajitas, papusas, and Enchiladas. Everything was great! Papusas where the best in town!!!"}
{"text":"The food is worth 5 stars.  Minus 1  for no one understanding English.  Call to ask what time they stop serving lunch the person that answered gave me to someone else, the person she gave me thought I was asking what time they open and close, so that's the answer she gave me then hung up. After eating here, minuse 1/2 for the fact they have a full dessert menu but had no dessert prepared. When I got there asked what time they stop serving lunch she said lunch is good all day when I got my bill I was charged full price. Minus 1/2"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was mediocre. I went on a Sunday and it took about an hour to be seated! It was packed! The wait staff weren't friendly necessarily, they were just doing their jobs and trying to keep up with the volume. I would eat there again, but probably order my food to go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I have loved every dish I've ever had here. All the tacos are good, my favorite is the sausage. I love all the platters that come with great salad, rice, delicious grilled meats and plantains. Also, boyfriend and I love going to breakfast there. I always get breakfast #2 with a side order of the best chorizo ever. Ask for the green salsa and the habenero if you like some more spice. Chipotle cream chicken is a delicious lunch special too."}
