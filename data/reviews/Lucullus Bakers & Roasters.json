{"text":"Visited this place over the weekend. Nice decorations and newly renovated. Good bakery items such as pineapple buns and such. I also like the hot food that they had ready to eat. Different rice options were good. Would go again."}
{"text":"Good environment,  decent pricing.  However the staff needs to be trained properly.   They schedule enough staff on a busy Sunday afternoon but messes up the orders,  lacks communication amongst one another and doesn't know how to prioritize their tasks."}
{"text":"Very clean and nicely decorated Chinese bakery! I've been to many Chinese bakeries in the area, and this is by far my favourite. I tried their pineapple bun that they are famous for, and the bread was very soft and fresh. One thing that would have made the experience better is if the bun was heated, but it was my fault for asking for it to-go.   It makes me very happy to walk into such a beautiful bakery. They have espresso, meals, cakes, and pastries as well that I would like to try in the future. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"For quick and cheap lunch, I def recommend their $5 combo meals. But not all the items are available depending on the time. I went on a sunday morning and they only had 3 items on the list available. The decor is really nice but very little seating. So if you plan to not get takeout, I suggest you not go during peak meal times."}
{"text":"I visit here regularly and I really enjoy the atmosphere here. They offer a good selection of hk styled buns and also have some meal items such as pasta, soups, few dim sum and steamed rice. Some of the items I've tried are:  - Curry chicken rice: portion filled me up but my friend thought it was a bit small. Came with a drink. Not many pieces of chicken, more potatoes and carrots. Overall decent choice for a quick and easy meal.  - chestnut tart: tart was nice and crumbly, filled with sponge cake, chestnut filling and cream. The chestnut filling was delicious, wasn't overly sweet.  - chocolate swiss roll: tasted a bit dry and stale.  -sandwiches: I love the white bread they use here! I've tried all their sandwiches and I enjoy the chicken salad one the most, flavorful with the taste of red peppers. The bread is very soft.  - cheesecake: a light cheesecake not very dense, on the creamy side. Delicate taste.  - triangle sponge cake: great eggy flavor, filled with thin layer of apricot? Jam and cream. Cake is very moist and soft.  - napolean: crunchy and crispy pastry. A bit too much cream to the ratio of pastry for my liking.  -BLB: Super soft and fluffy bread, crispy topping. Delicious!  - strawberry meringue cake: one of my favourites! Crispy, light meringue paired with fresh strawberries and cream.  The atmosphere is great here, I love the big windows and decor here. Often come here to enjoy a book and a snack. Service is meh but this place is mostly self serve anyways. They charge for hot water."}
{"text":"Good selection of pastries and food. However, they need to do something about the staff. There's one lady in particular that has zero manners and is very unpleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"Terrible dishonest customer service... I was ordering a 3lb cake for my uncle's 60th birthday, I heard they make delicious mango cake, took me an hour to order a cake...because 2 stuffs at the front, only 1 is serving customers, and they don't have the price. So I waited there and she called the chef at other location for the price. It was $18/lb   Finally she got the price and write my order down, i told her I am paying with cake cards and she said yes before, when I took the cake card out to pay, a lady came out from the kitchen saying that I can't use cake card to place a cake order... but I don't have cash so I have to pay extra fee to pay with debit no matter now much was my order...  On the day I asked my friend to help pick up, they told my friend they made a mistake, mango cal should be $20/lb, they asked my friend to pay $6... This really pissed me off. I won't recommend and won't go there ever again"}
{"text":"After reading rave reviews over their egg tarts I decided to give them a try about a month ago.  Yes they didn't disappoint however the service there was less than pleasing.  The woman at the counter was rude and abrupt.  I decided to give them a second chance since everyone has a bad day.  Last week, I ordered my son's birthday cake and requested a cartoon design from their catalogue.  I inquired for about 3 designs, all to which the woman says they couldn't recreate, for reasons unknown.  Why they were in the catalogue then is beyond me. So I finally settled for a very basic no-fancy-piping-required topping, because at this point I was getting frustrated.  Give me a fruit cake with a happy face sun made out of peaches, from the catalogue.  For whatever reason, she charged me an extra $5 on top of the base price.   So pickup day arrives and my husband said upon pickup the associate told him they could not create the design I wanted so they took off $5.  We ended up with your standard fruit cake with just Happy Birthday written on it. No bells and whistles here, people. The cake itself was good and it was fresh...or so I thought. A day later the fruit went bad, the cake emitted a sour odour so we ended up throwing out the leftovers. Money well spent?  I think not.  Suffice to say, this will be our last time going there."}
{"text":"BUN, DAN TAT (egg tart), RICE, AND EVERYTHING NICE. It's actually nice in there.  Unlike the other lucullus on 14th, this one is large enough to have comfortable sitting space."}
{"text":"My gf told me Lucullus Bakery has the best cheese cake, so we went there to get one to try at home. After I tasted it myself, I have to say they have the best cheese cake =)  It tasted so soft and fluffy for the cheese cake part, and the sweetness was just right. The crust at the bottom was very soft and crunchy, and it crumbled very easily which I very like. My gf also told me this is a hot item in the bakery because usually they get sold out very quickly.  We got the whole cheese cake, but if you don't like to get that many, you can just get them in pieces for you to choose..."}
{"text":"A new take on an old HK style bakery, this is easily the most exciting bakery to open in Downtown Markham.  When you walk in on a hot day, the floor to ceiling windows are completely removed, for an open air al fresco cafe feel.  You order your usual HK favourites, like sausage bun or pineapple bun freshly baked and still warm.  You can down your bun with HK milk tea, or any of the newer style cold drinks, including a iced Honey Chrysanthemum tea.  Hot food or coffee (pour over or espresso) is also available.  Hipster style decor and HK style food and patio seating make this a good place to meet up with friends or just to spend an hour enjoying the outdoors over a cold drink."}
{"text":"I've come to expect good quality HK style buns from Lucullus and was very excited about this new location. I will give this place 5 stars in terms of decor and seating - the high ceiling, brightly-lit fancy cafe style decor, the sheer abundance of seats (compared to its other locations) is great.  I've always been able to find a seat here and it's a great place to sit for brunch.  There's a wide variety of asian style buns - if you get the pineapple bun, always get it with butter and heated, it tastes absolutely delicious.  The egg tarts are one of my favourites but some of the other baked goods like their cookies are overpriced.  Their decently priced rice boxes are pretty popular and I've seen them sell out in the afternoon time.    Where Lucullus really drops the ball is their drinks - HK style cafes are known to have great milk tea/coffee/lemon tea etc.  I really can't enjoy their drinks here.  One time I had a lukewarm HK style milk tea, another time my lemon tea (large) had only two of the thinnest slices of lemon you will ever see.  I'm surprised they can even cut lemon that thin.  For a place that's as nicely decorated as Lucullus, they are pretty stingy with that lemon and their napkins.  I swear that I have to beg them for napkins because each plate comes with a small napkin, and even when I ask for more, they give only ONE extra napkin.   Lucullus, you are set up in a plaza that's trying to be fancy and your decor is gorgeous, please don't be stingy on the basics."}
{"text":"The decor is highlight of the experience. The coffee is ok too. But don't expect the staff to know the difference between 8oz and 12oz coffee. Totally ripped off on a \"large\" latte ( spelled \"late\" on the menu on the counter. ) Expect a language barrier and inadequate cutlery. ( Chinese wide soup spoon on offer to eat a piece of cake with. What!?)  Service is substandard.  This place is for looks only."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and relaxing bite. They are at the same building as the Downtown Markham Cineplex between Milestones and South St Burger facing the parking lot.  This bakery brand has been around for years and quite reputable for their buns, cheesecakes, HK style milk tea and hot food combos.  Just like their downtown location they have this nice Euro style decor. Very clean and relaxing. You can dine in (order and sit down) or take out.  They also have warm goods like sticky rice good during those chilly days.   They also have $5.00 meal combos which consists of a steam rice of your choice along with coffee or tea of your choice. See photos for menu.  TIP: TAX FREE after purchasing 6 buns.  TIP 2: You CANNOT access the bakery through the theatre building, entrance is outside.  TIP 3: If you can't get in here, their older location is at 14th and Kennedy inside the plaza with Thai One On.  TIP 4: There are two unisex bathrooms in the back."}
{"text":"They sell by far the best egg tarts in Markham! Their egg tarts are flaky and make this magnificent crunch sound when you bite into them. The egg is not too sweet, but sweet enough to give its' name, the egg tart. They use Omega 3 eggs; I don't know if that makes a difference. Each egg tart costs $1.50. Their buns are also very delicious. If you buy more than 6, there is no tax. I highly recommend their pineapple buns, BBQ pork bun and sausage buns. If you're in that area, make sure you check out this bakery!"}
{"text":"Enter the HK Tims. Come here if you want HK style buns and milk tea. The price per bun is higher than other HK bakeries but the quality is far superior. Standout items include the baked casseroles, absolutely the best bang for your buck at $6.75; not only do you get a hot baked rice dish but it also comes with a drink of your choice. Don't be fooled by the low price, the casserole is dynamite and rivals many higher priced casseroles of many HK restaurants *ahem blue ocean cafe*. Another favourite which can do no wrong is the mango mochi. Always just the right amount of soft and gooey mochi on the outside and heavenly mango flavoured custard on the inside; it garners extra points for being unique to the usual HK bakery selections."}
{"text":"I always love this bakery and have always been a fan of the 14th & Kennedy location. This new location however has a cute European cafe feel once you walk in and has all the yummy food I always enjoy, char siu bao and egg tarts! The décor was so welcoming, it made me wanna have a seat and just enjoy my snack for a few minutes. Must try their cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Bakery items are pretty good, but customer service needs some improvement !!! The \"auntie\" at the cashier are very mean and not very customer friendly.  I get it during peak hours are quite stressful.  However, Auntie, you do not need to give out attitude to the customers."}
{"text":"I was attracted by the nice decor outside. Also, it was a hit for my family.    Although, today it was the first time I came to try the rice boxes.  They mixed up our order. They are not  attentive even though for certain the one they told me was mine was not.    So I thought the meals were $5 a box but nvm that. I rather spend an extra $3 at a hk afternoon cafe for some decent food and service with better portion.    In the end, the service was rude and has attitude.  Price is reasonable but portion literally for people with small appetite."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Better quality baked goods than the other locations uptown.   Nice spacious sit down area with ambient classical music to relax over a cup of HK Milk Tea or while you're wolfing down that $5.00 rice combo during your lunch break."}
{"text":"Pretty much a Chinese Starbucks, serves coffee, teas, and speciality drinks plus chinese and western pastries. Cheese tart for 2 bucks is decent. Latte that I order could be better, espresso shots needs some work as it was very bitter. Also got a green tea Mochi with taro stuff, worst Mochi I ever had, taro was dry and taste less."}
{"text":"Been going to the bayview and hwy 7 location for years. A local favourite of mine for their milk tea and steam rice specials!   A new favourite of mine are their croissants!! They are worth it and a buttery goodness!!  This location also is very modern, gorgeous and a lot closer to my place!!!"}
{"text":"The decor is wonderful. For a Lucullus bakery the same baked goods are about 10cents more than the other locations. The seating area is much better, no more fighting uncle and aunties in the morning for spots.   Must have: fresh pineapple bun in the morning! Sometimes they're gone so fast the buns don't even make it onto the display rack."}
{"text":"Been a couple times now, really like the whole set-up. Would be a nice place to hang out and just relax.   A nice open concept, with lots of windows getting great natural light makes this place very pleasing to the eyes. At the same time, the decor is very modern yet bright. A nice contrast to other bakeries you would go to.   I had heard that the steamed rice meals were very inexpensive here. Although it was more than what I had heard, $6 for the meal and a drink its quite a steal in this area. However, if you are hungry, I don't recommend it. I tried the Red Curry Chicken, and it was quite good. Not all that spicy, but nice depth of flavour. The Hong Kong Style Tea here is really good though. One of the best I think.   Just a nice place to sit in for a quick, inexpensive meal. Definitely worth a visit if you're close by!"}
{"text":"The baked goods are great, but their attitudes suck.   The cashiers act like I'm begging for free food everytime.    I don't expect a Thank you , but she didn't have to throw my change on the counter like I was a beggar.   Just freaking unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ordered a mango mousse cake for my mom's birthday.  I ordered the smallest one they had and it was still massive! Could've easily fed 10-12 people.  Great value for $32!    When they first presented me with the cake, I was a little bit hesitant because the mango didn't look ripe at all.  To my surprise, it tastes great.  The cake was not overly sweet and the mousse was perfect with tons of mango flavour.  The fresh mango on top tasted great as well!  The cream was not too heavy either.  The design of the cake looked a bit messy though.  To end, food and service were good."}
{"text":"Nice bakery but horrible service as staff all have terrible attitude. Doesn't matter how nicely the bakery is designed and looks because every time you go you feel rushed at the line with rude staff which makes you want to leave the premises as soon as you pay. Baked goods taste similar to the typical Asian bakeries on the pricey side."}
{"text":"The curry chicken rice came in the same tin foil container as the other location.  This curry chicken rice dish tasted particularly better here for some reason.  The rice and chicken were great and the curry sauce was perfect; not too spicy at all.  I think the number of chicken pieces were a bit on the cheap side though.  Nevertheless, I really liked the curry sauce that infused into the chicken here!  Yum!"}
{"text":"The interior design and decor of this chinese bakery is the best I have seen in Markham. Definitely makes it a more comfortable environment for afternoon tea to chat with friends or for some quiet reading. Very spacious inside. They offer the usual chinese buns you would find at any other asian bakery, as well as cakes, dim sum dishes, and beverages. Their buns seem to be a bit more expensive than most bakeries, especially for the quality they offer. Their buns are quite average, nothing special. Same goes with their HK milk tea. Similar to other chinese bakeries, you don't have to pay taxes if you purchase more than 5 buns."}
{"text":"Ordered crispy egg tart, pineapple bun, and the $3.99 lunch set with Chicken A La King and hot milk tea.  Egg tart: Excellent. It might indeed be the best egg tart in town. Fatty, but good.  Pineapple bun: I'm not normally a big fan for pineapple bun and doesn't feel the same excitement for it as with the egg tart. It did have a sufficient and thick top crust if that's what fans are looking for. Good bun. No complain.  Lunch set: Price is good for a small tray of rice and chicken. However, it's quite bland. I enjoyed my milk tea more.  Didn't get to try any cakes or western style pastries yet today. Maybe next time.  I will certainly come back again for the crispy egg tart and milk tea to go with it.   However, parking is extremely limited and that's probably the only thing that will make me think twice about returning."}
{"text":"This bakery's been here for as long as I've remembered, and I don't know why no one's reviewed this location yet. They've recently updated their decor in keeping with their also-recent opening of the Enterprise location at VIP Cineplex theatre in Spring 2016.  One reason I think they're successful is because they strive to keep with the century old baking methods, and at the same time keeping their rustic/elegant interior look up-to-date, including their trays, baskets, cutlery & plates (yes I notice that!) (unlike other Chinese bakeries today) - so really bringing Chinese bakery up a notch to be enjoyed at a sophisticated level among other tea time snacks.   Their drinks are up-to-par, consistent and reliable. Their service is friendly and I can see returning customers whenever I visit because they simply have trust in this bakery and its quality. Aside from baked goods, they also have an expanded menu of steamed rice and sandwiches which you can also enjoy in their small dine-in area."}
{"text":"The fiance and I had a busy day ahead of us, so I suggested Lucullus for a quick and cheap bite.  This Lucullus is a lot nicer than the other one on Kennedy and 14th. There is a nice selection of dum sum, buns, and desserts to choose from, as well as one of their pre-made combo meals for $6 including a coffee.   Everything looked really good and I wanted to try everything. I spent $25 at a Chinese bakery, which is a lot, considering everything is so darn cheap.   Their BBQ pork buns are probably my favourite thing. We also enjoyed their curry chicken rice box with a coffee. The fiance commented on how their coffee was really tasty and it was a nice surprise, since he wasn't expecting much. His past coffee experiences from Chinese bakeries haven't exactly been positive. The curry chicken was also really good. The perfect amount of spice and sweetness.  Some of the dim sum I got was super greasy, like the taro and meat dumpling with chewy pastry. I actually had to squeeze some of the grease out with a napkin. This bakery is also much more expensive than other Chinese bakeries. You're paying for the quality, name, and rent of this place, lol."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the concept of this place but wasn't overly impressed with anything. The milk tea is very bland and to upgrade to a cold drink with the $6 meal combo is $2...1/3rd price of the entire meal. The bread is also mediocre - soft but typical Chinese bakery bread but also bland. Tried the egg tart and nothing too special. The mushroom and chicken steam rice was decent though!"}
{"text":"Recently we bought a birthday cake here last minute. Good thing they keep ready stock of the cakes. My fav is still the cheescake, but this cake was delicious also, believe it was green tea, not too sweet and not too much icing. wish there was some fruits on it tho. It was delicious and it was  finished within minutes after it was cut! the cakes are on the higher price side, but its delicious.  it can be really hard to find parking here during busy hours."}
{"text":"It's a wonderful location, it's beautiful inside, light bright and fresh looking   Wonderful tiling on the floor, deep mahogany and black woods surround you and to be honest the whole place gives off a trendy upmarket Mediterranean vibe   I loved it   Then I ordered ..... Black tea was disgusting and the chocolate Swiss roll had the texture of packing foam and just as dry  As a venue it's fantastic as a coffee/tea stop ..... Bleurgh!"}
{"text":"Two words: PINEAPPLE BUNS.   The first Lucullus Bakery that opened in Toronto has a similar environment to most Chinese bakeries, but after the investment of a new European styled design, they really upscaled the typical Chinese Bakery scene into an interesting fusion mix.  I came here for one of the instagram events and we were able to try their chrysanthemum drinks with honey (delicious taste) and their FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN PINEAPPLE BUNS. It's definitely their signature because the crust is thin and soft and the bun melts in your mouth. Will definitely come back as a customer, when I'm around this area for movies!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place a one but the decor was actually nice.  After having visited the main bakery at Kennedy and 14th I went to this one to see if they had the mango with sticky rice.  Luckily they did, I grabbed them and went to pay.  There were two women at the cash and yet it took 5 mins for me to pay and she rudely threw them back at me with no plastic bag and threw my change on the counter.    I definitely would not be coming back just based on the terrible service alone.  What good is it to have nice ambience but than deal with there rude servers.  No thanks id rather stick to main location at least she was nice enough to bag and to pass me change nicely."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch since I work around the area. It's in the new area where the VIP cinemas are.  Upon entering it is very nicely set up like a Cafe. Tables and chairs on one side, the bakery items at the back, ordering on the right hand side.   The lunch specials are not posted on the wall, it is on a piece of paper where the cashier is.  For 6 dollars can get a small box of steamed rice with choice of protein.  And a choice of drink.   I got the black bean spare ribs with lemon tea.   The box of rice comes in a little tinfoil square box. You put your own soya sauce.  The box of rice is small for the price.  It's slightly bigger than the rice you get from dim sum.    The service was not that good.  The two people taking orders were not very pleasant.  An older gentleman went to pick up his food and asked for a cup of hot water.  But the two ladies replied \"you have to pay for it\".  So he asked how much, and she replied $0.75. So the gentleman declined.  It's not like he didn't purchase anything to eat, he just wanted hot water with his meal.    We went at 12:00 and a lot of the rice boxes were not ready yet.   They also had clam chowder, which was 5.95.  A little on the expensive side.    The rice was mediocre.  The rice was luke warm, there were about 6 pieces of spare ribs on top. Hmm... Wouldn't come back since there's so many other selections in the area.  Might come back to try their pastries  It's a nice sit down spot to have a chat, as it's not very noisy or crammed."}
{"text":"Came here at 7PM on a Thursday evening before watching a movie, to try out their meal combos and some of their sweets. The first time we came here, they ran out of meal combos by 5PM, but luckily this time, they have several choices left for dinner.  My BF got the pork ribs with black beans on steamed rice combo with lemon tea for $6. The meal was surprisingly very small, and didn't taste good. Won't get that again but it was worth a try since fellow Yelpers have ordered meal combos here.  I got a ham and cheese croissant ($2.5) and a slice of mango mousse cake. I've asked the server to microwave the ham and cheese croissant as I prefer it warm. The ham and cheese croissant was good and there is a big amount of meat and cheese on it. The croissant was nice and flaky, and over-all it was delicious! Will definitely get that again!  The mango mousse cake is a good big slice for only $4.25, but as far as the taste goes, it was a bit bland in my opinion. The size is big and filling, but the cake lacks flavor. The mousse wasn't as soft and light as I expected from a mango mousse cake.. I guess I have been spoiled by the quality of cakes at Bakery Nakamura. Haha. I won't get the mango mousse again, but perhaps try other cakes when I come back. They have quite a few choices.  Service is nice and friendly and the place is well-kept and clean.

{"text":"This review is more 3.5 stars. On my way home from a haircut I stopped in for a bite to eat at Lucullus Bakers & Roasters. I was impressed upon stepping into the space, which is bright & airy with a beautiful coffee bar, decorative metal ceiling tiles, instrumental piano tunes playing, and ample seating (in contrast with many other Asian bakeries which tend to encourage takeout over staying in).  I ordered a tuna fish bun and milk tea. This came to $3.35. The bun was fresh tasting. The milk tea is pretty standard as far as Hong King style milk tea goes. There are plenty of traditional Chinese buns to choose from, as well as bread and cakes. Today they had seafood chowder on offering for $5.95, which comes with a dinner roll. They also offer some other steamed buns and had shrimp Sui Mai available and made to order (apparently takes 15 min).  If you're looking for a spacious relaxed place to enjoy some traditional Chinese bakery items, this is a place to try.  (8/100)"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today after eating at South Street Burger.  For a buns bakery, very impressed with interior.  Very modern and roomy.  Great for chilling and surfing the internet.  I would now make this my first choice over Panera Bread. However, dim sum looked pricey.  Not sure if I would pay Lucullus pricing - higher than a dim sum restaurant. Had the mango mochi and chestnut tarte.  OK and good for price. Nice place to sit and talk but would not be my first choice for a meal with so many other places in the area e.g. Peachtree plaza and Thai Express."}
{"text":"Love there milk tea and pineapple buns. My mom love their chestnut cakes. They sell ??? and they are huge!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I had high expectations of Lucullus after seeing and reading so many good things about it online but, besides the stunning decor and set-up, their flavours didn't hit the spot.  The prices, while not a huge difference, also felt a bit more expensive than other Chinese bakeries.    This location is perfect and should get a lot of traffic - conveniently placed in the same bulding complex as the Markham cineplex, after seeing an afternoon movie, my brother and I went to Lucullus for a snack. We got a sweet donut ($1.35), a butter omega-3 egg tart ($1.35), a BLB or bo lo bao - a crunchy cookie crust on top of a soft bun ($1.35), and a chicken in cream sauce bun ($1.55). They all tasted pretty average or even less - the egg tart sadly didn't have much flavour and the buns didn't taste that fresh.   I'd go and give it another shot if I'm in the area to try other items and/or have coffee. Pros include its location and decor but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food."}
{"text":"This is a good bakery.  They have a good variety of fresh baked buns.  I like the corned beef buns.  Not too many bakeries make this bun.  The rice casserole is a bargain.  $3.99 for chicken, sparerib, beef or minced pork over rice, and it even includes a drink.   I really like the hong kong milk tea.  The taste of their tea comes closest to Hong Kong.  There is a science to making perfect hong kong milk tea - a perfect blend, the right amount of evaporated milk and the perfect temperature.  Most restaurants across North America use cheap Lipton leaves and give too little milk.  Some restaurant owners from mainland China use condensed milk in the tea, and that's a no-no.  After trying tea from Vancouver, San Francisco, LA, NY and others in the GTA, I have to say Lucullus's tea is very good."}
{"text":"Take note, I only had their bakery items on a quiet weekday. Their decor is gorgeous and overall a great place to relax. They make the cookie crust egg tart and many true hong kong bakery classics, so full marks on that too. Some items were out of stock, but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Lucullus is a bakery that's been around for a long time in Markham area at 14th and Kennedy.  Their latest store is located at downtown Markham in the VIP Cineplex plaza just beside South Street Burger.  It can only be accessible from the outside.  The decoration is beautiful and looks high end with a few tables and chairs for customers to sit down and eat.  They have a huge area for customers to choose their bakery goods and also offer the $5 meal combo that comes with a rice and a drink.  I went here at around 430pm with a few friends and I got an egg tart and an iced milk tea.  I have to say, I was very disappointed with the egg tart, I think it would be much better if it was hot, their ice tea on the other hand was decent.  But egg tart with an iced milk tea for $4 is a little expensive for my liking."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! French bistro-looking decor doesn't seem to go well with the HK style bakery food style though. I was expecting more pastries than chinese dimsum & buns before I walked in. Their HK style food is still good,lineup was a bit confusing but it cleared up fast. Might consider trying their specialty coffee next time. The high ceiling makes this place very comfortable & bright,however the seating area was not comfortable at all. If you're looking to just grab & go,then this place isn't a bad choice. Downside is, this place is not connected to the inside of the building,only accessible from the outside,so if you parked underground,you'd have to exit the building facing the South side and walk West to get here,right next to South St.Burger."}
{"text":"There are so many Chinese bakeries around that it's always a quest to find the best one around. Lucullus Bakery is tucked away in a small plaza at the corner of 14th Ave and Kennedy Rd. The parking can be horrendous, as it is small and packed with customers going into Fancy Chinese Restaurant next door.  Regardless, this bakery offers not only a variety of freshly baked buns, but hot meals to go. There is a breakfast, lunch, or dinner option, offering chicken and mushroom, porkchops, spareribs, curry chicken, preserved sausage, and beef. It comes with a hot beverage for a total of about $4.  As mentioned, this bakery makes a killer HK style milk tea. It is strong and rich with flavour. Goes great with your meal or with a hot Chinese bun at hand.  Be sure to check this bakery out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"My mom introduced me to this place after she received a bakery card from our good family friend's wedding.... tucked in a little plaza on 14th ave and kennedy road, it is usually very inconvenient for her to stop into the plaza on her way home from work.. however, she tells me the buns are awesome and they even serve meals like a HK style cafe... so I said that she had to show me why it was soo good.   The buns are at a Markham premium of 90 cents/  bun.. unlike the stiff competition who are selling at a markdown of 50 cents (at Gloucestors, and I was quite surprised because it is quite a premium bakery). There is a little sit down area, and in addition to the buns, and cakes that are sold, there are also hot meals. You can get rice with toppings like pork chops for $3.99. NO joke. 3.99, it will fill you up for lunch, and perhaps can even count for a dinner meal. There is also the option of a HK style breakfast - drink, noodles, and bread.. for yes.... $3.99. That is crazy! I ate the bun in the seating area, and shared a piping hot cup of HK style tea - so strong, so rich, so good. The bun was pretty good - not overly doughy, but had great taste... deservingly 3.5*  How I wish there was such good HK style cafes in the heart of Van..."}
{"text":"This place caught our eye on our drive home. When we entered we did not expect a typical HK style cafe.  The decor is nice and it's shiny and clean. The selection of baked goods was OK. .nothing out of the ordinary. We grabbed two milk teas, sticky rice and a few buns including their pineapple bun that are so highly recommended.  The buns were OK....the sticky rice was not warm..and the milk tea was average.  Nothing really stood out to us,  except for the fact that this place charges you to pay with debit and the cashier was kind of rude. Oh and she didn't know what a fork was. We asked for a fork a few times and she looked at us funny and gave us a spoon.   The pour overs, coffee beans and roasters looked more for display and I would be hesitant to try a proper pour over there.  Its too bad as this place had a lot of potential. ..but it's just another average HK style cafe"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now. Once, shortly after it had just opened for the day so just me in the store and another occasion after a movie had let out a bunch of people. Both times, I had great service.  Ambiance and decor is definitely attractive for a chinese bakery but most important is the quality. I find the Chinese breads to be one of the better ones I've tasted in town. The pineapple buns can be ordered with a whole piece of butter or half butter (perfect portion, I think!). The HK style milk tea was steaming hot and I really liked the brown sugar option because not many Asian places offer it.  I also tried their steamed rice - curry chicken - very good and filling! It doesn't look it but it was.  I am very glad to have this in downtown Markham. Though the parking can be a pain but I can't really fault the bakery for this."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed coming here for some pineapple buns which they make so we'll. For a Chinese bakery, they are actually quite average, but I think it's good comfort food / snack for those who come from Hong Kong. They make a decent milk tea and they offer a wide range of cakes as well. My favorite is their cheese cake. I don't know other bakeries that make the cheese cake in a similar way. It's super fluffy and just the right flavor every time. I think I like it mainly because I grew up thinking that was what all cheesecakes tastes like. I still prefer it to say a new York cheese cake. I like how light the flavor is in this version, almost like Japanese cheesecake, but it's fluffy and creamy in texture."}
{"text":"The decor here is a step up from that of a typical Asian bakery, but sadly the food/drink items I tried were average at best. The interior is quite spacious though and there's plenty of seating so I would still come here to hang out before a movie or meet up with friends.  I got a tuna bun and an egg tart with an iced lemon tea; both pastries were very mediocre and definitely not the best I've had of either. The tuna bun in particular was lacking in flavour and the bread tasted a little stale. The iced tea was better - plenty of lemon slices and the right amount of sweetness.  Not a bad place to get a snack if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4.5 stars but unfortunately there isn't an option for halves.  I was really busy during the week and needed to get a cake for my moms birthday. I wasn't going to cheap out and go to costco or a supermarket - so I decided to try this bakery. I went in at 10AM and asked specifically for a fruit cake, with specific instructions on what to put inside the cake and what to write on it. It was a little more than a cake at a supermarket but it was well worth it.  The lady at the counter asked when I wanted the cake and said that I could pick it up tomorrow. I told her I needed it by today, so she told me to give her a time - 12PM. Giving her two hours to get the cake ready. I went in at 11:55, the cake was ready and looked beautiful.  The cake tasted really good, the only thing wrong was it was a little too sweet - other than that, it was amazing (this is where they lost the 0.5 star)  Overall, I'd recommend this place. The lady at the front is really nice and their service is phenomenal.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Buns and other products are good, but over-priced, especially with recent price increases.   Steamed rice dishes at lunch time is convenient, but the rice is too mushy. It's also cooked in individual aluminum containers, which is not so good for your health. Milk tea is average."}
{"text":"Great bakery, with a deep heritage of Hong Kong style patisserie!  This new location is spectacular, European feels, with adequate seating; though the lack of wifi is a bit of a downer.  Their quality of baked goods are quite consistent with their history, delicious and affordable; they even have some pretty good $5.00 combos!  Very nice chill spot in a growing community"}
{"text":"I love this bakery!! Their prices aren't as cheap as some of the other places for their buns, but that's because their buns are pretty good quality. Last time i went the pineapple buns just came out of the oven and i bought one and ate it there with the americano... perfect match! the bun was so delicious - the pineapple crust was crispy and the inside of the bread was warm and soft. OMG it was delicious.  I ordered their cake before as well and it was pretty delicious!! even though it was last minute, the cake was not too sweet, and they usually have diferent types available depending on what size and flavours you're looking for. Anyway would like to get their buns and their coffee (americano) is decent."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars.  Interior décor and ambiance +0.5 star.  Overall 3.5 stars.  This Lucullus looks really nice inside.  The high ceiling, the cast iron, the colour, accessories all give an European vibe.  The food quality was not bad.  The quality didn't wow or disappoint me.  The selection is good, even for lunches.  The lunch meal deals ($6) are small portioned, but come with a hot beverage, so the value is acceptable.  Alternatively, one can choose one of the dim sum, such as Chicken and Rice in Lotus Leaf, Chinese sausages roll ($3), etc..  I made a lunch out of two dim sum, and I was quite full.    I would return for a small dim sum lunch if the craving hits me."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is famous for their pineapple buns (or BLBs as I call them for short in Chinese). This place is always busy and the moment fresh BLBs come out of the oven, people swarm to get them.  Today I literally fought two women to get some BLBs because they totally cut and blocked me off from getting any. They took out at least 4 trays of fresh BLBs and they disappeared in less than a minute. Their HK style milk tea is decent here too though I don't often get it because I always need to add a mountain load of sugar to balance out the bitterness. It's a poppin place just be ready to fight the crowd."}
{"text":"I must say, this place is much better than the one on 14th Ave and Kennedy Rd!!!  The venue is upscale and very contemporary.  The service from your server is the  usual HK; fast, efficient, no nonsense pay-and-go style.  These servers/cashiers gives me a sense that they appreciate your business.  The food is decent and my usual order is the Steamed Pork Meat with Rice special, along with a small hot beverage.  I have no doubt, the other selections are delicious!  However, I dread the day that one of their rude server may transfer from the 14th Ave location.  In fact she used to work in the location up in Richmond Hill but has since closed down, and I wonder if it was due to her own demise....  I'm sure those who've been to the 14th Ave and Richmond Hill  location know who I'm talking about.....  I wonder if she's the owner?  Hmm..."}
{"text":"Aunt recommended this place for hk style milk tea. Really the smoothest hk style milk tea and coffee place in the area. The bakery items are average but had lots of variety. Cashier was quirky."}
{"text":"The following review is for their cakes.   I've ordered cakes here on a few occasions. Overall I've tried their fruit cake, mango mousse cake, and chestnut cake. I enjoyed their cakes. They were sweet, but not too sweet. I also like how they use cream instead of frosting. The chestnut cake is probably my favourite.   For their fruit cake, I found the cake had too much fruit and not enough cream. Also, because we asked for it to say Happy Birthday on top, they seem to have skimped on the fruit on top of the cake, unlike the fruit cakes they had on display. I feel this may sound a bit contradicting since I'm saying there's not enough fruit outside but too much on the inside, but there simply was not enough cream to cake ratio because of the excessive amount of fruits.   As for the mango and chestnut cake, they both had good flavour and the cake themselves were moist."}
{"text":"If your a coffee purist turn around and walk out. I came here on a Sunday morning. The place looks great when you walk in, plenty of opulent seating, lots of treats, and many coffee options on the menu.  The person at the counter spoke very broken English and after painful discourse I was finally able to determine that they had a single type of coffee brewed and she was not able to tell me what it was, offering me a cappuccino instead.  I was very disappointed and would never go back. I recommend the Aroma cafe in the same mall instead."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite Asian bakery. Their buns are a little pricier than other places but well worth it, especially the tuna one which is my favourite! Their cheesecake here is to die for and I frequently find myself back here for a craving! Love this place and the fact that they stepped up the decor from a regular bun place makes this place absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Came in for desserts (March 26, 2016).  Ordered:  HK milk tea, $3.00; Coffee Americano, $2.75; 6 pastries- Fruit tart, $5. Apricot flan, $2.50 each (2). Napoleon, $2.75. Red Bean Rice cake, $2.85. Chestnut tart, $2.85.  Ambiance is modern and bar-like. Pastries were not FRESH and expensive for its sub-par quality (common in most Chinese bakeries). Both drinks were very good and worth their prices.  No wifi."}
{"text":"Very rarely can you find a Chinese bakery/cafe that is so nicely furnished and clean. Tried one of their beef rice combo with milk tea for $6. What a great deal if you are looking for a cheap and quick meal. They baked goods are also really good. Tried the chicken pot pie which is shaped like a Mcdonalds apple pie. Wow did it taste good. Can't wait to try some of thier other items."}
{"text":"I've been to Fancy many times but somehow had not noticed this bakery next door. That was remedied today.  In search of baked good to bring in to the office today, Yelp led me to this location which opened at 7AM and was close enough to my work route. It was bright and clean and smelled wonderful. I gathered a selection of buns and two kinds of walnut cookies. Not being a fan of sweet beans or lotus paste, my pickings focused on savory and coconut,  As I walked to my car I realized the buns were still warm. I ate an oven fresh coconut bun on the drive to work and it was amazing.  Everyone at the office enjoyed the treats as well. They were added to our tremendous Chinese New Year treat stash."}
{"text":"Loved their breakfast combos: niche plus a meat + a hot drink + a sandwich for $4.16 taxes included.  But they stopped ordering it in 2014.  Best hk style tea in town. Lunch rice boxes already great,  though a bit small for guys.  Don't get the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Very dry."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their pineapple buns and egg tarts! awesome milk tea too!"}
{"text":"A Chinese bakery with a premium feel.  Never thought I would say that.  Pros: Great atmosphere Lots of items to choose from  Cons: Items not restocked as quick  If you're used to the standard Chinese bakery, you know the word premium is usually not associated with them.  Lucullus looks to change that with this new outlet in downtown Markham.  The place has a really good feel to it.  It's feels like a old school train station to me.    We came by on a Saturday morning for breakfast.  As soon as you walk in, it's unlike any Chinese bakery you've ever been to.  The front is where the seats are and the back is where all the goods are.  They have a vast selection of items too choose from.  They are not restocked as fast though when they are out.  The egg tarts were all gone when we got there and after 30 minutes, there still weren't any to buy.  The same could be said about a lot of other items which were all sold at the time.  We ordered a couple of buns and two steamed rice combos.  Each combo comes with a drink for $6.  The steamed rices were decent.  The chicken and mushroom one had about 3 slivers of mushrooms which was a little disappointing.  The salty egg and Chinese sausage was much better.  My little one loved the cheese bun.  For some reason, I was expecting real cheese instead of processed.  A little weird on my part because I know it's always been processed but the premium feel of this place made me feel otherwise.  Lucullus looks to change the Chinese bakery game.  If they can work on their restock times it will definitely be a fav of mine in the future."}
{"text":"This is the 4th Lucullus location that I know of with the others being the original in Richmond Hill, Markham and downtown T.O.  This newest location is located as part of the Cineplex Theatre but the entrance is on the outside as you can't enter from within the complex.    They definitely gone upscale here with the beautiful decor, lighting table seating, jazz music playing in the background etc...  However I was very pleasantly surprised the pricing seems to be the same as the other locations.   Buns and pastries range from $1-$4, set prepared rice dishes with drinks for $6.  Yes they are more expensive then most bakeries but at least its price the same as the other locations and is by far the cheapest option in the complex.  They could have gone higher due to the clientele and location but refreshingly stayed the same.  This alone gives them a bump in a star rating for me!    Service is similar to other locations as its quick and abrupt so don't expect a smile on the faces of the workers:)  I really do enjoy drinking my Hong Kong style milk tea here as its a really nice environment instead of a cramped Asian bakery!  Feel like I'm in an upscale cafe without paying an upscale price!"}
{"text":"A tad better than your average Chinese bakery, but also a bit more expensive.  Less than a 5 minute drive from Pacific Mall.  First of all, I'm not the HUGEST fan of Chinese bakeries.  I find them all pretty mediocre and since they're soo abundant, and sold at places like T&T, I don't find them 'special'.  I prefer European bakeries or even Taiwanese.  Anyway, I thought this place was alright.  Prices are slightly higher than your average Chinese bakery.  The actual buns taste lighter and are primarily sweet, despite their filling.   I tried the Grandma Cake (dunno what it's called in English) and that was fresh, flaky, but a bit lardy.  Curry Beef was alright, not super flavourful.  And the Corned Beef one was, I think, mixed with butter which wasn't to my liking.  Again, actual bun part tasted good.  HK Milk Tea was quite strong, but not as nicely flavoured as other places.  Parking:  Despite the size of the lot which appears to be reasonable for the size of the plaza, it was quite difficult to find a spot!  I'd definitely go back to try their sweeter buns, custard tarts, cakes, and perhaps meals!"}
{"text":"Best egg tarts in Toronto, especially when they're hot straight from the oven.   The ladies that work there aren't that nice. I order politely and stand to the side. Reminds me of hong kong."}
{"text":"Came here to try their 'tong sui' which consisted of a Sweet ginger soup base, sweet yam and sweet yam mochis/dumplings.   The soup base was pretty good. I love ginger type desserts and this was pretty spicy for a dessert. What I didn't like was the amount of sweet yam that was in this. It was too much and just started to get really heavy as you continued having it.  Based on that dessert alone, I wasn't very impressed. I have had their baked goods before and those are decent. The place is also nice and cozy.   I'll be coming back eventually, just not for that dessert I had."}
{"text":"I came here after the movies and decided to take a quick bite at this new Lucullus location on Enterprise. People have been raving about how nice it is, I had to go see for myself! I love how grand the finish is... with beautiful European-styled decor from floor to ceiling. The coffee bar is especially captivating. But sadly, that's about it.  Price point - on the expensive side and I don't see the value. It is not like we are getting amazing food quality here. Ok, fine... I give it that we eat ambiance too, and ambiance was nice.  Food quality and presentation - sub par on the sweet potato dumpling in sweet ginger soup. I give another star for the extra spicy ginger they used (I love ginger) but the dumpling was already falling apart from overcooking and had became mushy. And I'm really not impressed with the $6 rice combo. If you plan to go fancy on me, it is unacceptable to serve me a rice bowl in an aluminium foil container. This is no cafeteria. At least make an effort to make it look presentable. And the rice was dried out from steaming the whole day... awesome!  Service - what service? The cashier lady didn't even crack a smile nor made us feel welcome... she gave us a blank look. Thank god we don't have to pay tips.  ------------------------------------  This bakery has an amazing amount of potential because of its prime location, but just need to up its game to survive in Downtown Markham. I do believe in second chances... I will come back to try again. Let's see if Lucullus can redeem themselves then."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is perfect walking in. There is so much character and it would normally be indicative of a cafe that serves awesome food and drinks. Well....the food wasnt too bad...but the drinks were  FOOD:  Red bean bao- doughey but not chewy, sweet red bean inside. I would have liked a little bit more texture in the dough.   Egg custard pastry- It fell apart when we lifted it. Custard tasted ok though. Its indentical to a normal circle egg custard tart, judt rectangular.   Beef curry pastry- This one, I liked. It had a soft spice, good curry flavour and was flaky goodness.   Coconut bear claw- Soft, buttery, awesome coconut pieces. Also pretty large.   DRINKS:  Honeysuckle lemon/honey tea- unbearebly sweet. Ot is actually so disgustingly sweet that it gave me a headache just sipping on it. I dont know if it is usually served this way, but I think people need the option of sweetening it themselves.   Latte: It tasted okay, but it was definitely not a latte. She just steamed a cup of milk and sortnof dumped it in. If you are planning on having coffee on your menu, do it right!  I will be reviewing their coffee on thecoffeeguys.ca soon!!   SUMMARY:  Their food is okay. The drinks are pretty bad. Their service was terrible. It was rushed and completely non-personable. These people do not have the aptitude to run a customer service based business. Lastly, there is a debit transaction fee of$0.25. If you are going to offer a debit machine, why not pay for it as a business lile everyone else? It was promising based on looks, but what this shop boils down to is nothing special."}
{"text":"If you want bad service and a frown, this is the place to come. Horrible attitude by the lady and when she gave me back my change, she pretty much tossed it on the counter.  Life might be bad for her but don't make it bad for the rest of us. Never again."}
{"text":"Erm... to be honest, I would only come here for the decor. It's a super foncy European style, Chinese bakery/cafe located in the heart of 'downtown' Markham. Parking is actually not that convenient, and it kinda sucks if it's not great weather. The parking lot is pretty much clustered on the east side of the plaza, while this bakery is on the west. And because the parking lot itself is not that big, you'll either have to wait for a bit to get a decent spot, or park ass far, and I mean far, for this bakery.  Their menu is pretty random... you get all your usual cafe stuff like coffee and tea and buns, but they also serve 'sweet soup' (tong sui)... yeah... Their cookies are also way overpriced... $6.50 a bag, which is more than their lunch. Their set lunches are only $5, which includes a drink. It's basically steamed rice with your choice of chicken and mushroom, ground pork, short ribs, etc. The usual steamed rices you'll find at dim sum restaurants. It's a tad small but for the price you're paying it's a decent buy at this place. IMO the cookies are nothing too out of the ordinary and you can find them pretty much the same quality at other Chinese bakeries and even Western grocery stores. I'd suggest sticking with their buns, particularly their pineapple bun with a healthy thick slice of butter. Yum  There's not a tonne of seating available, but a good number. They really do try to go for the European feel, with a black iron looking fence and chairs and all. The bakery itself is also way bigger than I expected. They also have a 'coffee bar-looking' section right at the entrance... which I don't think is for real use but just for looks. Nonethless, this place does look quite nice.  It is a nice place to sit down with a friend or two and just chat and maybe take some pics of the place, but other than that I don't think I'll be coming here much."}
{"text":"Fresh bakery! Highly recommend their buns, all delicious, all tasty. Yum. Chinese bakery. Good to grab a snack, or a hot drink. Located right in the heart of what is developing to be downtown Markham. Amazing location right beside the movie theatre (you could chill here before a movie)! The decor on the inside is a surprise, a beautiful surprise when you walk in. Very clean kept, and unique design! Would defiantly recommend as the best Chinese bakery I've ever been too!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for a lunch. They increased the price! The Steamed rice combos used to be $5 each with a hot tea/milk tea, but now its $6. Also costed me an extra $0.75 because I wanted the VITA carton soya milk instead. That is a rip off I would say - I would understand if they charged $0.25 or $0.50 more maybe? But charging close to a dollar extra when the prices of your rice meals have already been increased? You can buy a pack of 6 for $4 at the supermarket.  The rice combos were ok. I ordered the white cream sauce with chicken and mushroom. The cream sauce was ok, but I didn't like how the mushrooms were the canned mushrooms kind - but I didn't really expect much out of it anyways. Quite a few pieces of chicken meat so that was good, but in terms of portion it was a lot of rice. My boyfriend had the black bean spareribs rice combo, classic. There wasn't much black beans though.  You would hope maybe they could give a piece of chicken feet (like the other locations do), or a piece of veggie to go with just plain spareribs and rice. Don't forget to add soya sauce, that is key!  We also ordered some dim sum on the side. $5.50 for 4 pieces of Siu Mai? Pretty darn expensive I would say compared to even ordering dim sum at a restaurant. The Siu Mai tasted good, a lot of pork meat mixed with shrimp and mushrooms. We also had a spring roll, and deep fried taro dumplings. These two items were both really good in terms of taste and quality of ingredients - I would have preferred the taro dumplings hot though. The egg tarts were ok, I found them slightly too sweet. Loved the shape. Would have enjoyed them more if they were hot and straight out of the oven.   I must say the deco of this bakery is really nice. The atmosphere makes it seem like a luxurious bakery, which I suppose definitely explains the steep prices compared to its other franchises."}
{"text":"came here for the first time. ordered a dozen egg tarts and a chocolate mousse cake.  egg tarts were $16 and change. cake was $30. the egg tarts were good but i've had much better at a cheaper price. the cake however was very good. i'm not a fan of cake. i expected it to be very sweet and heavy but it was a very light cake, the cake was sweet but it wasn't overwhelming at all."}
{"text":"The steamed rice are mediocre and smaller than full size rice plates available at other HK style restaurants, but they are cheap ($5-6) and come with a drink. The menu is a bit hidden, only available at the counter."}
{"text":"Lucullus opens at Downtown Markham is kind of exciting. A real cafe setting that one can drink Hong Kong Style Milk Tea and enjoy some Chinese baked goods including Bo Lo Bao Pineapple Bun.  They even offers house roasted coffee.   Meal Combo for $5 still available if you want some cheap eats.  Plastic bistro style chairs already wobbling, or maybe my friend put on some weight over the holidays.  A lot of potential."}
{"text":"If you think all chinese bakeries are dirty, fly-infested, and filled with underwhelming and underfilled pastries, you clearly have not been to this one. Lucullus takes a Western elegant twist on Chinese bakeries and really elevates the pineapple bun into something more.  I am an absolute fan of the decor. Holy BLB. It's just so quaint, and dainty. I feel like royalty just standing under the brightly lit chandeliers and gothic style coffee machines. Really great atmosphere for any time of the day.  Now for a quick review of all the pastries I tried:  Matcha green tea white chocolate croissant - this is amazing you must try 5/5 dark chocolate croissant - this is really good but tastes like costco chocolatines (4.5/5) Apricot and raisin bread - this looks fantastic but it's just bread with apricot drizzled on top and raisins (3/5) Pineapple Bun - if fresh (5/5), if not (3/5)  They also sell entrees which I heard are pretty good. Rice + meat dishes with tomato/cream/curry sauces. Typical HK style cafe food.  I've been several times at night time too, but they don't do quick sale discounts which is sad. I don't really like paying full price for almost-day-old bread."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here just for their drinks and pastry; however, if you're catching a movie with friends and need a place to hang out before or after the movie then this is not a bad choice.  Average chinese pastry is around $1.35. Small milk tea is $1.85. Food was very ok; not bad but nothing to rave about.   I saw many people order $6 combo which came with a small rice dish and a drink; I didn't try this so can't comment on it.  This place only takes cash. There's a small charge (50 cents I think) for using debit."}
{"text":"although there is official sign up yet.  they are off to quite a good start.  the location is good considering the growth that is expected to come from this downtown markham area.    decor in this place is pretty unique and nice... its got this European vibe yet its a chinese bakery at heart.  at about 20-30 cents more a bun/tart its bakery is priced slightly higher... which is justifiable given the location/ambiance.  overall, it allows for an opportunity to sneak buns and goodies into the theatre if your going to watch a movie. (my future plan... shhh)  never thought i would get fresh egg tart while watching a movie...  its also a good place to get a quick cheap bite before the movie.  why pay 10+ dollars for thai delight/south street burger.... or even more for milestones or me-va-me..  5 dollars gets you rice combo with a drink (bottle water, milk tea, hot lemon tea etc.)  pretty dirt cheap considering the competitors in this area."}
{"text":"Much nicer decor than any other location but average quality food and service. They have stepped it up and tried to go all premium at this location. If you haven't  noticed the price has seem to gone up or seems more expensive than most Chinese bakery. The food quality is just average nothing too special but consistent with their other location.  The service.... ordered their rice combo a little after the lunch rush, it was the steam chicken and mushroom rice. They said it would take 15min which was fine, but that 15min soon turned into 5 more minutes... when asked again same thing, so that 15min soon became 20, 25, and eventually 30min... seriously I can make my own in 20min or less. When I got the dish there were barely any chicken or mushroom, which makes me wonder why 30min.... I ended up making the same dish 2 days later at home with much more ingredients!   I guess the location is new and needs someone to manage the kitchen better."}
