{"text":"Not many people can say that they have been going to the same restaurant since they were 2 years old but for me this is the truth. I was practically weaned by this restaurant and although it is ten years older than me, we have grown up together.

This is superb Indian food, full of flavour and hard to beat. I would definitely advise booking as The Hilal gets really busy even mid week- people travel far and wide for its cuisine. There is no wait and the moment you reach your table , hot crispy poppadums materialise before you  even have a chance to sit down. The mains are so large I would dispense with a starter and my recommendation would be to try the tandoori chicken massalla which is sublime and actually retains the chargrilled flavour within a creamy sauce.

This is my \"take my Mum out for Mother's Day\" place as she pulls her face if I take her anywhere else. Great food and lovely waiters who spend a little time with each table and look after you as if you are  family."}

{"text":"Wow this place has been going for forty years and I visited during my trip back home. The food was great but the service was a tad hit and miss. Maybe because it was Friday night and very busy.
I would still go back again as the food made up for it."}
