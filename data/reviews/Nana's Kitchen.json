{"text":"Don't fucking eat here!!! Do yourself a favor. Was stuck staying at this hotel and had no choice to eat here. Raw chicken in my fettuccine Alfredo with this horrible jerk spice on it. This place doesn't have a clue about italian food. Bartender was nice and got me a pizza instead. You could tell that it was a frozen dough. When a pizza is cooked properly, the crust is crispy all the way through! It wasn't . It was still doughy and uncooked! Nothing is fresh here! You are better off going to the BP and having a subway sandwich next door."}
{"text":"4 stars specifically for the pot roast on Sunday night. I have no idea how chef got so many flavors into a simple dish, and the textures were perfectly in tune with those flavors. I suppose it helps that he actually made it on Saturday and then added fresh al-dente veggies upon ordering. 
Edit: apparently chef made this on a whim...it's not on the menu. If you're in the vicinity tonight 11/2/14 go get it with a glass of red."}
{"text":"This food is essentially of the same quality as bachelor food past midnight. Don't bother -- get a hot pocket instead."}
{"text":"I feel like three stars is generous, but I'm going to give them because in the end, we got a lot of tasty food for our money and the staff took care of us. First off, when you walk  in, the sign points you toward the restaurant and you end up on the opposite end of the dining room from the hostess stand sign \"Wait to be Seated\". Weird that you have to walk through the dining room past people eating to the hostess stand. Anyway, we sit down, are given the buffet spiel, which is what 4 out of 5 of us do--$12 for mixed greens salads, soup, and a make your own pasta bar? Yes, order made. Wine was not so easy. When we asked for a wine list, we got a hand-written, on printer paper list--really? No prices, so we asked about bottles, and were told glasses were generally $6. So we get two bottles (there are 5 of us), 4 buffets, a bowl of soup, and 1 bruschetta. The soup doesn't come out until we have already had our pasta made and are eating it. Then the wine is brought to our table opened and no one tastes the wine before it is poured. It's just poured. Giant glasses for everyone. No preamble. Disappointing because ordering wine can be so fun and I have never had a bottle brought to my table already open before. Ever. So, when we finally do get the bill, the soup is still on there, as well as 5 buffets (not 4) and two bottles of $32 Ecco Domani--whaaaaa?? We know ED is $10 max in the store and even at $6 a glass, we paid too much. We ask to see a manager to speak about it, and she gives us a price discount because of the miscommunication, but then the bill needs to be revised three more times because of server mistakes. Sigh. End result is we get free dessert (I'll find out how good that is once I'm home), decent priced wine, and a really good pasta buffet. But damn, did it have to be so hard?!?!"}
{"text":"Went to cleveland this weekend . And while staying in the hotel. Thought we would try the restaurant bar, So we sat at the bar had 2 long island 2 double shots of absolute.   6 wings and some horrible bruschetta. our bill came out to hundred and 5 dollars. Have never been price gouged like that in my life. And it wasn't even a nice restaurant. WILL NEVER GO BACK....."}
{"text":"Pasta buffet until 9pm.

Let me tell you, this was awkward! We walked in and were greeted by 2 employees. Not a single person in the place. Before we were even sat the hostess drug us over to a buffet table and began telling us about the homemade lasagna, breadsticks, salad, and whatever else was up there. She then sat us and was joined by another woman, that makes 3 people standing at our table.  Okay so we sat down and I said, politely \"okay, so what next?\" We ordered drinks and then I was  escorted back to the buffet table, yes by all 3 women.  Now if this couldn't get any weirder, another person showed up, this time a man (the cook). He wanted to tell us all about the lasagna he made earlier and how great it was.  I don't know about ya'll, but I really don't care for an audience especially and audience who happens to be the creator of the dish I just might pass up.  I really felt obligated to try everything this guy cooked and I still had his 3 ladies standing behind me.  I kid you not, the 4 of us stood there and decided what I might like to eat.  To make matters worse, they had a create your own pasta bar, good lord I wanted to die.  After plating some of everything from the first buffet I was shoved over to the create your own side.  This was by far the worst part.  I wanted to check out my options then maybe sit down and think about it first, but nope that wasn't an option.  With 3 ladies and 1 cook with me I choose my pasta, sauce, veggies and spices and I got a big ol' plate of something I really didn't want.  I made the mistake of calling penne, rigatoni and was given a 5 minute lecture as to the difference between penne pasta and rigatoni! Yes I know the difference, I just made a mistake, maybe because I had 4 people watching me and all I wanted to do was get the hell out of there.  I finally made it back to my seat and my 4 friends never left my side. All 4 of them stood a few feet away and watched every single bite I took. I eventually had to say something and since it was so bizarre I couldn't help but to laugh hysterically. I said \"is this for real?\" The 4 spectators didn't understand what I was asking nor did they understand how uncomfortable they had made myself and my boyfriend.  I ate as fast as I possible could with all them watching. They, all 4 brought my check, change and watched as I tipped. Oh, yeah you wanted to know about the food right? Well, it was pretty good actually.  Now, do I recommend it? No way! I would never subject a fellow yelper to such a horrible dining experience.  Now that it's over and I look back, I can laugh even harder then when It was happening. Must say this is by far the craziest dinner I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Very rude waitress. She wasn't helpful and acted like we were a hassle in a dead restaurant. We walked out. Definitely not worth paying $18 for a plate with that kind of service."}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from this place on terminal growing up. Every restaurant that has popped up in this location has been mediocre. Today I came in to visit while visiting town and did the salad bar. The pasta bar was amazing."}
{"text":"Great country fried steak and eggs bottomless cup of coffee. Eggs just as ordered. Great gem of a place. Make sure you try it out"}
