{"text":"I'm giving this sucker a 5 star because of the value. I followed much of the advice of the other yelpers and there were some great dishes at a very reasonable price. I'm coming from Montreal and you'd pay 30-50% more here for the same thing. 

Great job!"}
{"text":"Offering up \"snacks and libation\" from 5pm to 2am, Monday to Saturday, this brand new spot just north of Queen proves to be a great and funky stop to grab a little bite. 

There are three reasons why this new restaurant appealed to me... 

First, the atmosphere is very cool and casual - there really is no theme or d√©cor; it almost looks as though they opened before they were done decorating, but in a charming way that allows it to become almost homelike in its honesty. Even the menu is printed on a piece of lined paper that remains set on the table on a (mini-sized) clipboard.

Second, someone here has tapped into that great ordeal; you have already eaten dinner, but the energy spent on socializing has left you feeling a bit ravenous. The problem is that you don't want to go out for a whole second meal. The answer: Snack Bar. The small, inexpensive portions are a perfect pairing with after work drinks (you won't ruin your dinner appetite) or a nightcap (you won't stuff yourself to the point of uncomfortable).  

Third, they understand that \"snack\" to food-lovers means more than grabbing a granola bar or settling for a muffin for satisfaction.  They have nibble-sized some of your favourite late-night snacks, including a grilled hot dog, pork belly on a bun, Jamaican beef patties and pizza pockets at an appetizing price-point of $3 - $6. There are a few other items, like oysters (coming in at $6 - $7) and latkes with gravlax, to give the menu some oomph.

I started with the pork belly on a bun, one of items I saw featured on their website - a delicious crispy pork morsel tucked inside a steamed bun, filled with Asian-inspired flavours (like Hoisin and chili sauces) and some leaves of arugula, making a wonderfully balanced salty treat. 

Then, I rounded things off with a grown-up version of the nostalgia-inducing pizza pocket. This is really more likened to a mini-mini-calzone; it's crispy and airy, stuffed with cheese and laid upon a bed of rustic tomato sauce. After the super flavourful pork belly bun this almost seemed bland, but it was perfectly cheesy and the crunch was on-point. My dining partner caved in and got the hot dog - it was smaller than expected, but hit the spot - followed by the Jamaican beef patty. Both were good, but the bun and pocket are a more interesting choice at the Snack Bar. 

The drinks menu is very scant, but I won't sneer at a cold beer. Overall, I think 416 Snack Bar is on its way to being one of those great spots in the city. I'm going to keep my eye on this one - it's something new and unique and, I use the word again, honest. This could prove to be a new favourite for many a food-loving Torontonian."}
{"text":"A great tapas place where everything on the menu basically is 5$ with tax. Gets super busy and usually is practically impossible to find a table. Loud music so you'll be shouting to whoever you went there with. This is perfect for someone looking for a trendy place, have a serious amount of drinks and eat finger food because they can and don't give any fucks. It's also rapper Action Bronson's favourite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is great for:
- a date - it's a small and busy place; also, the music is loud, so you'll need to get close to whoever you're with
- if you're looking to have a few good drinks and small sharing plates at a trendy, low-lit place

This is not a good place for:
- a large group - even a group of 4 may have to wait longer than usual; and they do not take reservations
- if you're looking to eat a big meal
- if you want a variety of dessert - the only dessert is an \"after eight jos louis\" which I did not try

My experience: 4.5/5
My boyfriend and I went on Valentine's day, which was a Friday night, at around 6:45 pm.  The place was busy.  The host was very friendly and took our name and number to contact us when seating was available. He said it would take 20-30 minute, but we received a text about 15 minutes later which asked us to confirm if we will be there and in how long, or to inform them if we wanted to cancel. We sat at the bar - the seating was very close to each other, but my boyfriend and I didn't mind.  We shared a bottle of the Cote du Rhone ($50) - as Toronto is known to overprice their wine in restaurants, we found the wine prices to be reasonable or on par with other restaurants in comparison. 

What we ate:

1) 6 oysters ($15) - 4/5
- the oysters were small but delicious and they were shucked well

2) foie torchon with toasts ($7) - 4/5
- this plate is good for two 
- the foie was smooth, rich, and tasty. It's served with some kind of sweet apple puree which paired well with the foie.  There was more of the apple puree than was necessary as it overpowered the foie if you put too much of it

3) steak tartare ($7) - 4.5/5
- the steak tartare is place on top of 2 pieces of thinly sliced bread
- it was delicious and melted in your mouth

Service: 4/5
- we found the host and the bartender who served us to be attentive and friendly

Overall, it was a great place for an intimate date where you're looking to enjoy a few drinks and small tapas plates."}
{"text":"Good vibes, great for friends with adventurous food tastes. I enjoyed the various creations and food was pretty phenomenal. Overall vibe and decor was unique. Great attention to detail. However, you guys gotta figure out the lineup situation when it gets busy. It's  awkward to have large people spilling into the main dining area. Does get pricey for the amount of food we were served. Good to try once, not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar has been my go-to for late night casual drinks and snacks however I am writing this review because of the horrible service I received. I am very well acquainted with the set-up and style of dining 416 however was rudely surprised by the host Mel last week. I came in with a party of 3 and was told there were only seats for 2 available. No problem, I told her we'll take the seats and if another table opens up if she would be so kind to move us. This seemed to be a huge request as Mel rolled her eyes and walked away. We sat ourselves at the bar and she took our order 10ft away from us and even the cooks were closer to us. Is that her indication that we are not worth her time? I found it very rude as a server she was being deliberately standoffish and unwelcoming. We listed what we wanted and she stared as my friend ordered without any indication she was registering what we were saying. I saw three tables leave and continued to ask her to be moved as my other friend was standing while we were all eating. The bartender ended up moving us while Mel stood there like a log. She is the rudest server I have ever encountered and what was supposed to be a fun night out with friends ended up being ruined by a girl who had an attitude problem. I hope anyone who goes to 416 doesn't receive the same type of service I did because it completely ruins what would be a great, low-key restaurant."}

I was introduced to Snack Bar by a friend and I fell in love with this place instantly. This is a cozy little place with an ever changing snacks menu and a full bar. The prices are a bit on the higher side and you won't be able to get a table after 9pm, but when you do, you'll have a great time, thanks to the attentive owner who's sometimes waiting the tables.  I highly recommend the oysters and the steak tartar. But definitely, pre-drink before you head to this place as the drinks are also on the pricey side. Bottom line, recommended!"}
{"text":"I love me some small plates. There's something so exciting about trying a ton of different foods in a single meal. 416 Snack Bar did not disappoint.

My husband and I came here early on a Saturday (6:15ish) hoping to avoid waiting for a table, since we were starving. It worked; we were seated right away. 

We ordered:

- Beer - A bottle of Tusker ($8) and some Dieu du Ciel hibiscus beer ($7), which was on tap - yum.
- 2 x steamed pork buns ($5 each) - A nice soft bun with melt-in-your-mouth, hoisin-slathered pork.
- 2 x spicy tuna hand rolls ($5 each) - I don't know if it's because I don't usually go to high-end sushi places, but this was hands-down the best hand roll I've had in my life. Fresh tuna, spicy/sour pickled ginger, something crispy - maybe rice noodles? - and it was nice and spicy. Mmm. Still thinking about this one.
- Korean fried chicken ($4?) - Crispy, sweet, tender. Really impressive.
- Yakitori  ($4?) - Grilled skewered chicken in a sweet sauce. Good but not amazing.
- Trini doubles ($3) - Curried chickpeas with chutney, served on deep-fried turmeric buns. The turmeric buns were great, but overall this was just okay - a bit too sour. To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of chutney. 
- Iberian snack bowl ($4?) - Another just-okay dish. Meatballs, potatoes, and grilled bread in a vinegary tomato broth. Again, too sour for me.

This place is hipster heaven, but it's got the chops to back it up. The food was great and so was the service; our food was served in a steady stream, the servers consistently refilled our glasses of water, and they always seemed to be there just when we were in the mood to order more. And all menu items are tax included, which is a nice touch. The two of us walked away full for just $50 plus tip."}
{"text":"Had the foie gras torchon and steak tartare for $7 each (tax included, wow!). Favorite dish was the eggplant double down for $4. Nice hip vibe, good service, good food. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"PROS: Excellent finger food: tiny burgers, tiny salads, tiny tacos - tiny price (avg $3-5 each). Great bar atmosphere. Big tables for groups (if you are early enough to get one).

CONS: Limited seating (is also a PRO as always busy) and in the summer No A/C which makes it a little brutal at times.

BOTTOM LINE: If you like appetizers for dinner - go! If you are looking for a place to snack and drink with friends - go! Great after work and after hours place on Queen West."}
{"text":"I love this place!! beef tartare, hand-rolled tuna, and foie gras are to die for.!! I also love the fact that they know how to serve all classic cocktails here. I always have the Last Word...delish! Ambiance is cool, music is a bit too loud, and service...oh this can be a problem. 3 out of 5 times I come here, I will leave frustrated with the service. I love the staff, but they could definitely be a little more attentive. Like, it's fun to see them having fun, doing shots and what not, but don't leave me with an empty glass for 20 minutes while doing shots with ppl at the bar. Or often take so long to greet and approach a table with menus etc... it is often the case here, but as I said..I love the food and the ambiance, so, if I have to, I get up and go tell my server whatever I need. I'll keep coming back lol"}
{"text":"This place was hoppin' on a Thursday night! so much so that almost ALL the tables and bar seats were taken up by the typical Queen West-West crowd. After about half an hour of waiting and one well made gin and tonic later....all 7 of us were cozily seated on a table with very high bar stools. You could either lean back and cross your arms, or hunch over the table.. a little awkward, but I was too happy to have a seat to complain.
We ordered 2 plates of a whole variety of options from the snack menu. The things that really stood out were the pork belly buns and the latkes with smoked salmon and cream cheese, everything else was good, but not memorable. I'm definitely trying the oysters next time, and perhaps a cocktail that's more challenging to prepare. 
The ambiance was *perfect*. Great music, not too loud, cool crowd, eclectic and interesting rustic decor, and best of all -  a small phone booth incase you receive a call while in this establishment and cant hear, you can quickly step in here(or sit, there's a comfy little single-seater sofa) instead of going outside and freezing till your call is done! 
If you aren't convinced to give this place a shot yet.... I went here last night, and I'm most likely going here again tomorrow. I think that just about explains how much I like this place."}
{"text":"Popped in one night to be treated to a fantastic jazz band. Small and cozy with good food, it's a fantastic date spot, and it's open late."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and original. Loved the double down and the steak tartare. Service was friendly and the best part was a surprise live band. Loud but lively. 

Only setback was that they don't take reservations but you can grab drinks nearby and they will text you when a table is ready."}
{"text":"I would really love to love this place, given the excellent location and how the small and intimate setting has potential, but I'm afraid it's overrated. 

I've been here on a weekday and on a weekend, and yes, it gets packed. The last time - it'll also likely be the last-last time - we walked in, hesitated because nobody acknowledged us, before settling in to a small four-person table. A couple minutes later, we were oddly asked to get up from our seats and head to the cramped corner space at the bar because that table was \"for larger groups\", only to watch as two other patrons walked in behind us to sit at the table we'd just been shooed from. Not the best start. 

It took an uncomfortably long time to have someone come by our table (so long we actually considered leaving). A couple glasses of wine and a cheese platter later - the cheese selection went unexplained - I was ready to get out of there, although I had come in famished and ready to splurge on a copious amount of tapas.

Too bad. What should be a warm and friendly place seems oddly fixated on appearances, on being a place to see and be seen. The atmosphere is 'off'. Hip? Maybe, but the kind that comes off as cold rather than cool. 

The neat thing about sitting at the bar in the corner is that you get to watch the chef plate the food. He was friendly too, which unfortunately was the only genuinely enjoyable part of my time here."}
{"text":"I really like the food and the vibe of the place. The staff was quick and eager to answer our questions. The korean fried chicken was really good, but I absolutely loved their buffalo cheese jos louis!
I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was in town for a tradeshow and found this spot on Yelp. The place was packed, always a good sign. Very tasty appys: Oysters, steak tartare, spicy tuna roll and lamb chops were the highlights. Drinks were ok. DJ in the back corner kept the party going."}
{"text":"*** 3.5 ***

Don't want to eat a lot, but like to try everything on the menu? 416 Snack Bar manages to cater to both needs while putting their own spin on some of Toronto's ethnically diverse eats. With a short card and all their items hovering around the five-dollar mark, it's easy to eat your way down the entire menu of nibbles.

Pork Belly Bun
While David Chang's version of the pork bun he made popular isn't landing on Canadian soil for another 18 months or so, I hear-tell that 416 Snack Bar does a good rendition. With the requisite hoisin and scallions, there was also something slightly pickled that gave it an extra texture and vinegary punch. Chang comparisons aside, this pork belly bun stands on its own.

Latkes
I hadn't had a latke in years, so I ate these with some nostalgia. Topped with gravlax and a sprinkle of dill, these were pretty much what you'd expect.

Jamaican Beef Patty
The Jamaican beef patty was filled with shredded beef instead of the ground mush I was expecting. It came sided with a tasty hot sauce that gave it some kick. I found the pastry a bit dry and hard, though I feel that this is how the shell is supposed to be. I'm not really sure, given my negligible beef patty experience.

Saigon Mini Sub
Their take on the Vietnamese sub, the Saigon mini sub, is a tasty one with a softer bun. The slice of pate made this a richer version than what you'd find along Spadina. I wanted more coriander and hot peppers however, as they are notes that I heavily associate with the sub. These are pretty minor gripes, as I'd order this again.

Napolitano Pizza Pocket
Salty with a decent tomato taste, their Napolitano pizza pocket was essentially a bread-and-cheese mass - very filling. Though I had a saucier picture in my head, since you can eat only with your fingers here, I was glad that it held together so well.

The room is done up with rustic and reclaimed touches, making the space less dive and more derelicte. I counted seats for 32 in groups of 4-6, with 8 at the bar. Bring your own utensils and wet-naps if you don't like using your fingers!

{"text":"Here's the 411 on 416 - overpriced, pretentious and highly overrated. Seems like everyone wants to cash in on the tapas trend, but few do it well. 416's offerings aren't really bar food and they're not really tapas either. I think they are more aptly compared to the food samples you get at Costco - actually, even this analogy isn't entirely accurate because I've had food samples at Costco that tasted better and were more filling than what you get at 416. At $4 or $5 a shot, you'd expect at least a mouthful of what you order. The Korean fried chicken we ordered was literally four microscopic pieces of chicken that barely fit on the end of a toothpick. The doubles, yakitori, and a few other things we had, were equally unmemorable and unsatisfying. We were so starved afterwards that we went to fill up at Banh Mi Boys down the street. Leave this place for the hipsters and find a better option."}
{"text":"Awesome service which was such a treat since many of these hipster restaurants are completely lacking in customer service. Our waiter was so kind and informative. We went on a Tuesday night around 830 and managed to get the last table. It was very loud so we had to practically shout to hear each other. My favourite dishes were the Korean chicken, reuben sandwich and the fried eggplant sandwich. I actually ordered the Korean chicken and the reuben sandwich twice- they were that delicious! I loved the sauce on the Korean chicken and even dipped my other sandwiches in it.  I wasn't a big fan of the steak tartar since I found it bland and also didn't care for the perogies either. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots to bring friends from out of town. The ambiance is really cool, and the eclectic food selection + diverse drink menu is enjoyable. 

Have been here a number of times and by far my favourite times are later at night. The bartenders are also friendly. Once just told a bartender what spirits i enjoy and was crafted a custom cocktail. 

The Pork Belly bao 

Great spot. Must try."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this place.  This is the type of place that should be every ones \"local\", sit at the bar and chat with your neighbors.  The staff are lovely, the snacks are deeeeeelicious pockets of bite size morsels with a no cutlery philosophy (do not expect a meal here).  We have tried every single item on the snack menu (side note:  great presentation of the menu) and can honestly say they are all creative and fantastic accompaniments to our drinks.  Great vibe - make sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"With a bar you cannot really complain about their drink selection or their prices. You could always stick with beer and the music. Which are two things that are hard to mess up. Even when the music is bad, your drink (with enough of it) and your friends can drown that out. 

Food however, reaches in the visceral and emotional depth that go way beyond atmosphere and alcohol. And i have to say I cannot believe the atrocities incurred at this establishment. First off you're messing with a good thing. Banh Mi, Patties, the HOT DOG so deliciously simple is  reinvented in miniature and priced oppositional to its size. WHY? In the experiment of showcasing Toronto's best, SnackBar has decided to tamper with a good thing, with horrible copies of what is real and awesome. Banh Mi on a bun so soft and pasty in your mouth, combined with a shmear of pate so thick that it became a warm textural challenge.  The hot dog, served on the same bun, does not give off the salty and snappy greasy mess of what is easily found on the street.

There are possible a number culinary problems with the food here but nothing gets me more than what is being passed as \"odes\" to what are Toronto's favorites. Go out and get the real thing, it's right outside"}
{"text":"This place has unique food, although it is kind of small, so you feel rushed to eat. But if you are going for drinks and a quick bite, the environment is great!"}
{"text":"Two things really rubbed me the wrong about this place.

1. HYGIENE - We sat right in front of the front of house chef preparing all the dishes. He was scratching his neck and hair, playing with his phone, going in and out of the back room, all while eating (with bare hands) from the restaurant storage dishes and cooking food. His nails were black around the edges. We were going to order food until we saw this. Disgusting.

2. SERVICE - We waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged. It was not even that busy. The staff were too busy flirting and chatting with each other to tend to customers. We finally ordered and the drinks were fine. Then when it was time to leave, it took asking for the bill FOUR TIMES to get out of there. 

When the basics are neglected, who cares about the rest of the experience? Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Okay, so I showed up here too late and too drunk to be objective, but seriously, this place is awesome.  It's easy to glut yourself trying out all the tasty little things on the menu, but trust your server--he knows the good stuff.  This place has an excellent vibe, too.  It's like that awesome friend who knows exactly what you need (a barstool and a pizza pocket) when you've stumbled past last-call in your too-tight dancing shoes and who isn't going to judge you for getting hammered on a Tuesday night.  (Come on, you know you're going to.  You might as well do it here.)"}
{"text":"I personally love this place. I haven't been in a couple months, but I would head here every Tuesday night for some after class drink with friends. 
Cool, casual and just a great place to get some drinks and a tasty snack while socializing. 

I also feel that every time I'm there, the crowd is having a good time and not the typical cold Torontonian attitude you can get in this city at times.
Also, like that it's a crowd typically mid-late twenties like myself."}
{"text":"4/5! Great place for tapas and drinks! Good vibe but limited seating so be prepared to wait. Our favourite dishes were the pork buns and Korean fried chicken. Other good options are the Reuben sandwich, eggplant sandwich and veggie pakoras. The bartender was extremely accommodating and made drinks based on your preferences. Only downside is they ran out of empanadas and we had to wait a bit to get in!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately had terrible service. Unenthusiastic waiter and difficult to get orders taken. The food wasn't bad though but I won't be back here."}
{"text":"Here's the 411 on 416... 
Taking over the former space of Johny Bananas on Queen and Bathurst is 416 Snackbar.  It is exactly what it's name describes itself; Snacking place and drinking bar.  The menu is very small, as are the portions which are 'snack sizes'. My problem is I came here for dinner and was ravenous which was my first mistake.
It's the kind of place you drop into for drinks and to socialize and definitely after you have already eaten dinner, and want a few nibbles, this is the place to be. And it was busy!  We shared a communal table with another group and traffic just kept coming in and it was a school night!"}
{"text":"Been a few times now and 416 is still one of my favourite places to grab snacks and drinks. I've had David Chang's pork buns and I think each stands on its own. I love 416's version - the pork is just outstanding. The ever-changing menu is wonderful, though admittedly I really miss the tacos."}
{"text":"Great little NY styled spot to have yummy apps and delicious cocktails! Love the vibe in this place !!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. Great atmosphere, cool crowd, awesome food, good beer selection, friendly staff. Definitely a go-to dinner place for me now - with friends, as it could be a tad loud for a date and I could see myself shouting across the table asking her to repeat herself 5 times.

Steak tartar (4/5)
Spicy tuna hand roll (3/5)
Korean fried chicken (5/5)
Jerk grilled fish platter (3.5/5)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed 416 Snack Bar, it's a cute little spot to have some drinks and snacks.
The pork steamed buns were AMAZING - they were definitely my fave!
We also ordered the Korean fried chicken and spicy tuna hand roll, all delicious.
They have Ace Pilsner here which I first tried when I flew Porter and really the only beer I recognized from their list.

The only reason why I knocked off a star is because it was REALLY loud, to the point where me and my friend were yelling at each other. We also were asked to share out table with others as we were sitting at a 4 person table and we were only 2. Not a big deal though!

All in all I would 100% come back!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great. Some of the dishes are Ah-Mazing, while others you hope to never see again.

A+:
Tuna Hand Roll- Love the crunch of the taro chips, and the seasoning was perfect!

Korean Fried Chicken- Should be renamed Crack Chicken. The sauce is spicy, sweet, and covers the most crunchy chicken morsels. Spicy, sweet goodness!

Scotch Egg Benny- Executed to perfection. The yolk is still runny when you bite in (how do they do that?!?!), and the Hollandaise is just the right amount of added extravagance. 

D-:

Frutti di Mare- This is a marinated seafood salad served in a lettuce leaf. Let me just say, the seafood was off. It had a really gnarly, \"I'm not fresh\", flavour to it. I couldn't finish it.

Vegetable Plate- Kind of forgettable, with the exception of the Fiddle Heads, which was a nice nod to Canadian produce.

Trinidadian Doubles- Once you've had Doubles in Scarborough, you know what to look for. This totally missed the mark. Chickpeas were under-seasoned, no spice or salt to be tasted. The accompanying Tamarind sauce was jarringly sweet. 

Pork Bun- I never knew that it was remotely possible to make Pork Belly dry. I almost choked trying to swallow this. So, so dry.

I want to give this place another shot when the menu rotates, because the A+ items show promise."}
{"text":"Used to come here regularly and take friends here when they visit from out of town. I'll never be back again because of the rude service. It seems that this restaurant has become so successful they no longer care about how they treat customers, because business is pretty much guaranteed anyway.

My friend and I arrived Friday night and were ignored as people who came in after us were approached by the host. We finally got his attention and his response: \"yep?\" After he understood that we'd also like to add our names to the wait list (shocking I know), we were told there's a 40 minute wait (pretty standard here, especially for Friday night. Don't take reservations). We asked if we could wait at the bar until a table opened up. No seats free but people were hovering. He walked away without saying anything. 

We went to the bar where two seats cleared up, sat down. Bartender looked at us and rolled her eyes. We were about to find out why. Same host comes over and says loudly and without meeting our eyes the entire time- as if he's talking above our heads \"actually there are people sitting there and there's a long list of people waiting in front of you so I'm going to have to ask you to move.\" We both apologized like good Canadians and I asked if we needed a reservation for the bar as well? This is the only restaurant in the city where that's the case. In the midst of explaining why we sat down, he interrupted me with this gem: \"we've been here for six years and have always done this soooo...\" So you're a rude, snotty, incompetent host at a trendy bar apparently. By this point, half the bar and the bartender with were eyeing us as this guy treated us like misbehaving kids.

I told him he could take our name off the list and we wouldn't be coming back. He interrupted me even as I said this with some throwaway \"Yeah ok we'll text you sure ok bye.\" 

Congratulations, 416 Snack Bar- you caught us: the city's nefarious bar stool-thiefs hellbent on bypassing cues. You fought the good fight, clearly. I hope the momentary ego boost you felt was worth losing about a dozen customers (my friend and I, our friends who came here with us a few times), host/list enforcer. 

Despite its name, this place does not represent my Toronto. So many fantastic bars and restaurants to choose from in this city, don't waste your time with the attitude here. (P.S: We went to Lisa Marie a few doors down and had a great time listening to a live DJ, eating yummy mini plates of Thai pouting and tuna tartar nachos), and chatting with the cool bartender and servers.)"}
{"text":"Great place for snacks and drinks. Food is very well priced. I ordered the KFC and steak tartare amongst many other things. These two stood out the most."}
{"text":"The drinks are great but I didn't enjoy the food. I think it's a great spot to hang out for a cozy gathering. The space is small and intimate."}
{"text":"Everything great. Tartar, cofit on toast, fish bun - all great. Additionally, service is top class."}
{"text":"This was a good late night spot. I had oysters, steak tartar, and the board (cured meats with romain leafs and caesar dressing to dip, kale with a balsamic dip), and Korean fried chicken - All very good. The beer selection was light. Good spot for late night, I would not plan on having a full dinner here (hence the \"snack bar\" in the name....)."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite new spot in Toronto. I have been a regular here since June 2011. Whatever mood you're in for a night out, 416 will satisfy. You can almost never go wrong with the menu. The Reuben is a staple on the menu and it's too die for! Probably the best I've ever had. The vibe is always good, service amazing, and prices fair. It gets super busy on weekends so head down early. Sit at the bar to get the full effect!"}
{"text":"Steak tartare is awesomely delicious. Not too spicy. Be forewarned this is a snack bar, so portions are small, probably need 2-3 to substitute for a meal."}
{"text":"I have come here twice with people who know the bar staff so I don't have the same issue with service. Either they listened to people's complaints or hired more servers or I was just lucky both times.

I had the scotched eggs benny with pork belly - so delicious. 

The place is small and indeed crowded. But the vibe is relaxed and the music is good. If you do have the luxury of choosing somewhere to sit beware of where the speakers are because once the DJ starts you won't be able to hear anything by the speakers.

If you do need to put your coat down somewhere, behind the wall on the left there is a phone booth with a chair in it that no one uses and makes a great coat room.

There is wifi, just ask a server for the very long password."}
{"text":"Interesting spot on Bathurst for tapas sized eats and drinks. The place is relatively small so there is normally a wait to get a spot to sit. Everything that we tried was great!"}
{"text":"A very fun and lively bar with great late night snacks! 

Young crowd, loud music and great atmosphere. 

my only issue after going a few times now is having to be aggressive for seating which is a bit disappointing, its quite a small space."}

As the rule, the food was eaten with our hands and we definitely chose a variety of dishes: steak tartare, Korean fried chicken, grilled peach and haloumi toasts and it's all greek to you more then satisfied our taste buds. Definitely will be back soon"}

And it's a gem at that intersection. A great way-stop after dinner, before a concert on Queen West, or just to split a bottle among friends and catch up. 

Go!"}
{"text":"Excellent drinks and food. Cozy environment. Hilarious staff. All around a great place to have some snacks with friends. Though as it is quite small, you have to get there early if you want a seat."}
{"text":"Great place for a drink. The food was a pleasant surprise. Approx $5 per dish (small portions, may need 3 to fill up). Whoever is responsible for the food knows what they are doing. The taste is there from the first bite. Had the Ruben sandwich and my palate is wanting more a couple of days after.. Service is great. Was served by one of the partners (I think his name was dave), who was very hospitable.
The only negative is that the crowd on busy nights (weekend), consists of whamabe hipsters... Yach.  
I warmly recommend 416 despita of some of its well manicured \"hipsters\"."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. We got perogies, steamed pork/fish buns, soup and stuffed yorkshire puddings :)"}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar is conveniently located on Bathurst, just north of Queen. The place is pretty small (maybe 35-40 seats including at the bar, all very tightly packed) and was very busy on the weeknight that we went. 

We had 6 people and they don't take reservations, so I arrived with 1 other person from my group approximately 30 minutes before we told the others to come. The server looked around and kind of shrugged saying they would do their best to seat us. We were put at a square 4-seat table. All the seats are bar height. One of our chairs was directly at the edge of the bar where servers were bustling past.

Luckily for us, we were moved to a larger table just as our first food order of oysters arrived. Unfortunately the longer table made it challenging to communicate because of the music/noise level in the bar. The oysters were fresh, properly shucked, and packed in a bed of salt.

Before we started ordering the rest of our food, I had a look around. It was just before 8pm and everyone else was just there with drinks. Seemed like we were one of few tables there to have a meal-sized amount of food.

Because of the nature of the menu being tapas or hors d'ouevres style, we were able to try a great deal of items and get many of the flavours on offer.

Rabbit food - their salad, and one of the few things vegetarian on the menu. It came as two lettuce wraps, and was delicious.

Steak tartare on a crostini - rich and excellent. I had a second order. Don't change it.

Shrimp pad thai salad roll - this was 2 viet/thai style salad rolls with a side of peanut sauce. The rolls had extremely hot peppers in them. I like spicy food; but these were definitely too hot and I am sure would be a major turn off for someone with less appreciation for spicy foods. Perhaps putting the spice in the dipping sauce would allow customers to control the spice level, instead of wrapping it directly into the roll.

Korean fried chicken - this is a popular item around town lately at Guu, County General, and Home of Hot Taste. I would say that 416's rendition was at least on par and a good way to try it in a slightly less expensive and smaller portion. The sauce was very tasty.

Lamb chop - again great. Don't change a thing.

Spicy tuna hand roll and steamed pork bun were average renditions.

The food that hit was great; but a couple of things were misses. The service was helpful and friendly; but perhaps limited by the noise and narrow movement areas.  The experience would probably have been better with 2 or 4 people (6 made it a challenge), and just to go for drinks and bar snacks rather than for a \"dinner\"."}
{"text":"Cool place! Dark, candle lit place with a dj spinning some chill hip hop beats. A nice place for wine or a cocktail with a friend, not a good place to meet people. \"No utensils\" food concept was interesting and worked for what we ordered. I liked all of the food we got. $9 for \"one person serving\" of the canadian cheese plate was definitely enough to share between two people - delicious! Wine was also great. 

Most beers around $7, most wine $10-12/glass, most tapas $6-10"}
{"text":"Great place to chill for the weekends. Can get very very busy since it's quite small and reach capacity fast. Food as the name suggests is all in snack form and a decent after hours place to hang out with your friends. I have tried the burgers and oysters and they are both good. Reasonably priced too. I haven't encountered the WOW factor over the few times I have been there as of yet and hence why not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cool place, great service. If we were working and lived near this place we would spend a lot of money here, but alas, we're mere backpackers and had to hold ourselves back.

We tried the mini mac, sushi pizza, scotch egg benny, pork steamed bun and the grilled thing (which was asparagus with Maltese sauce the day we ordered it). Everything was great. I'm trying to think of a stand out but there isn't really one... I guess the sushi pizza, scotch egg benny and pork steamed bun stand above the pack. 

Drinks menu is cool too. Go here! If you can get a seat... Or even if you have to stand."}

I opted to dine at 416 snack bar with fellow food bloggers on a Thursday night. We arrived around 7pm to find the place absolutely packed. We were told it'd be around 20 minutes, that didn't sound that bad...so we waited...and waited which ended up being around 45 minutes. I left angry (not at the restaurant) cause I was hungry and irritated that I wasted 45 minutes of my time waiting for nothing.

So what did I do? I returned the next day exactly when they opened at 5pm. And ta-dah I was the first one there and got to choose the table. Anyways, I just wanted to complain.

416 Snack bar is small places, and I mean really small. Don't come here with 4 or more people even on a weekday and expect to be seated. It is def more of a drinking place anyways and if you want to eat, most of the items are served in 2s so go with a friend and it will make your life so much easier.

It's not a place you want to have intimate dinner and discuss your worries. It is a small place and it does get super loud in here with all the people shouting at the top of their lungs especially with some alcohol in the system.

Ordered: Special Thing (Dungeness Crab Roll) 3/5

* Special Thing is like Special of the day and it changes constantly
* Diced up dungeness crab rolled up with cucumber
* It was light and refreshing
* Breadcrumbs were nice touch and it def added texture to the dish

Ordered: Steak Tartare 4/5

* 2 pieces of Steak tartare on bread for $5.31
* Steak tartare was almost melt in your mouth
* I liked how the marinade/sauce wasn't too sour
* Another solid dish

Ordered: Mushroom Toast 5/5

* 2 pieces of Wild mushroom on top of brioche toast for $4.42
* Fresh mushroom on top of brioche sounds like heaven
* This was light but so meaty with all the juicy mushroom
* Toasted brioche added some buttery'ness to the dish
* Must order

Ordered: Scotch Egg Benny 5/5

* 2 scotch egg benny for $4.43
* I've never had scotch egg benny before so I wasn't sure what to expect
* This was so good!! It was filled with egg goodness and the creamy texture was heavenly
* This is a must order when you visit! I can prob have 2 or more of this

Ordered: Korean Fried Chicken 3/5

* 3 pieces of fried chicken covered in sweet-spicy sauce for $4.43
* This was a little disappointing in terms of flavor
* It was spicy and dripping in sauce but the chicken was a little dry
* I didn't find it to be anything special

Ordered: Pork Belly Bun 3/5

* Pork belly and ginger in a Bao for $5
* Decent sized pork belly but the bun was a little soggy
* Interesting how they added ginger (ones you eat with sushi) to the bun which I did not like
* Would have preferred to have regular pickled veggies (carrots and radishes)
* Prefer pork belly bun from Swish by Han

Ordered: Lobster Roll 3/5

* 1 lobster roll with green bean for $7
* For it's price, this was tiny (size of my index finger)
* This was one of the items I was really looking forward to but didn't impress me
* Lobster was tossed in some butter sauce which made it a little too rich for me
* Bun was soft and the green beans added nice crunch to the roll but I didn't enjoy it that much

Summary: Much anticipated visit to 416 snack bar did not leave me disappointed. Some dishes were hit or miss but overall I enjoyed the dining experience. Snack menu style is becoming really popular all over Toronto and you just got to balance out if you want to be having a full meal or just drinks and snack. Worth checking out if you are looking for something light."}
{"text":"This place can get packed super quickly. It's tiny and you'll probably have to balance on a stool elbow to elbow with someone else and yelling into the ear of your party to be heard. But that's what makes it cool (maybe a bit too cool for skool). The oysters are OK, nothing to write home about. The beer options are decent but not a huge list. Actually, the menu is just a tiny clipboard with about six things listed on it. I'd go as a late-night stopover/quick drink/small snack since it's tucked away from the bustle on Queen St. W. There's usually people loitering around the doorway which can look intimidating but once you're inside, you'll fit right in."}
{"text":"Sat down at a table with 2 friends. We kinda felt that we were not welcome. Just finished work as servers and bartenders. 3 drinks for $35.  Not going back ever"}
{"text":"It's a tapas place, meaning you come here to eat like a bird and drink like a fish. It's grungy and one of the hostesseseses is a sexy Asian lady with tattoos and piercings. If I wasn't such a tiny shy little thing, I'd ask her for her number, but I guess I didn't have enough to drink.

The food was tasty, even though it was so little. We ordered sm√∂rg√•sbord, Korean fried chicken, oysters, and something else but it escapes my mind. All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar is the best snack bar in Toronto (since it's the only snack bar in Toronto). But really, it's a great bar/restaurant. 

The ambiance is very chic. The place looks like it's boarded up during the day (because the shutters look like wooden boards), but at night, the shutters are lifted, revealing a small and quant restaurant with a hipster, underground vibe. The walls are adorned with graffiti and lighting is very dim. I guess the owners are trying to keep their costs down? Regardless, it creates a hip atmosphere. 

The drinks are really good and standard; they offer numerous beers, wine and cocktails. Their snacks are a different story though; they are super random. From Korean chicken, to pork buns and cheese and meat plates, Snack bar 416 has quite an assortment of delicious international bites that will be sure to surprise you. 

The crowd is mostly young professionals in their late 20s. 

If you're planning on coming here, make sure to arrive early! It's a popular place. Also, avoid going to the washrooms; they are tiny and the doors are hard to close."}
{"text":"About as good as it's gets for delicious casual snack food in Toronto. Phenomenal beer and wine list as well."}
{"text":"When you got the munchies, there's nothing like a pork belly sandwich to hit the spot!

Firstly, the pork belly sandwich is freaking good.
Crispy pork skin with soft melt in your mouth pork belly. 
Sure, it's similar to what I can buy at a Chinese butcher, smothered in hoisin sauce... but that didn't make it any less fantastic. 

We couldn't resist and ordered another round of pork belly sandwiches  ($4 each).

In between rounds, we ordered the oysters (6) for $13 dollars.  
Cheap. Good. Lemon juice and horseradish, simple and perfect.

I was less impressed with the Jamaican beef patty.  Meh, I wouldn't get it again.  It was tiny, a bit soggy, and not very spicy.

416 Snack Bar is a fun place to grab a light bite whether you are a 416er, 647er, or a 905er/misc.

It's also neat that this place doesn't actually have any cutlery.
Ask! They don't!

You can grab a high bar stool, order some drinks and tasty snacks, while enjoying the laid-back casual hipster atmosphere.  It's not a surprise that this place is a hit.  Throw on some canvas walking shoes and a boyfriend jacket and come on down!"}
{"text":"Cute spot for drinks and snacks. I really liked the cider that I ordered from the menu (9$ per glass). Perfectly dry and very tasty. 

The Korean Fried Tofu - crispy battered cubes of silky tofu in a sweet sticky sauce - was nice but a bit one note. I expected more flavour and maybe a little heat. The Falafel Double Down - a mini sandwich with two falafels as the buns - was a little too bland and mushy for my taste. 

In the end... Great cider and average snacks."}
{"text":"Waited about 20 minutes on a Friday Night for 4, not too bad. Was seated and had a candle lit. We had fresh oysters. They were delicious. This is a great spot to come for an intimate date or a girls night. Everyone seemed to say hi to the bartenders and lots came in alone and sat at the bar. Really liked this spot and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday with my boyfriend. It was almost 7 and it was packed. Thankfully I spotted the table in the back and grabbed it. It's a good \"people watching\" spot. Anyways. 
We ordered:
The Greek salad - superb feta cheese used.
Scotch Egg Benny - didn't know what to expect. Supremely satisfied though. It was super ooey gooeyness. 
Taco night taco - the seasonings used for the beef were definitely NOT Old El Paso. Is was great. Would've preferred two small taco though. 
Pork Belly and fish Bun - like f**king heaven. So rich. Same fixings as peaking duck. I wanted to order so many more. 
Ruben sandwich - The entire thing melts in your mouth. *drool*

Service was awesome, very attentive. 
Also, I got a glass of the rose, it was yummy~

Verdict: I am SOOOOO coming back. 

Note: eating by candlelight is more scary than romantic lol"}
{"text":"Came where on a weekday and got a table quickly because it wasn't busy. The interior is very rustic and almost a shack like place. It's decorated with odd ttc ticket wallpaper and other strange items, which gives it a very unique yet strange ambience. The seating area is small and the washrooms are gross. They should try to clean every few hours rather than once a week. 

The food plates are small portions and prices are decent. The menu isn't so broad it has interesting items. We had tried a fish platter and the Korean fried chicken. The fish platter was alright, very under seasoned and some strange different tastes. The Korean fried chicken was pretty good and the sauce was even better. 

The waiter didn't seem to care too much or make an effort. The service was a bit slow considering they weren't so busy and most of the stay was busy socializing with each other. 

Over all, I don't think I would come back just because it wasn't a great experience. But if you are into a new trendy shack like environment with sometimes good food then this is your place."}
{"text":"Taste: I come here a lot after a late night out, so it 's always satisfying. A really diverse menu is offered here. The Spicy Tuna Handroll was good. I liked the added crunch of the taro chips in the handroll. I also tasted the Korean Fried Chicken which was seasoned very well, and the sweet and spicy sauce that coated the pieces was spot on. My favourite bite was the Eggplant Sangwich Doubledown because it was well balanced with the crunchy eggplant, and soft mozzarella and tomato. It was like a snack size eggplant lasagna!

Service: The servers and bartenders were nice and quick. Just expect for a small lineup on a nice night. The wait is never too long though (about 10-15 minutes).

Value: Most items on the menu are $5. Other than the oysters and some platters that they offer, their menu items range from $5 - $7. I think it's the perfect value for their snack size plates.

Ambiance: Although it is a small space and a little dark, I like the ambiance. It's a cool place to hang with good music always playing."}
{"text":"Zen!  Food was perfectly executed.  Korean fried chicken came out hot and spicy.  Tartare was delicious on warm fresh baked bread.  Do it!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. A tad expensive for a small item but totally worth it. So dive in. The music is good and in the summer when the window door is open, lots of air to keep cool."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the vibes are really chill! I would really recommend the Korean fried chicken, I got it both times I've been here and would get again!"}
{"text":"I dropped in to meet a friend for a quick drink on a Friday evening. The place was pretty full with the cinq √† sept crowd, only a few seats left around the bar -- but this was nothing compared to how crammed it was by the time I left. 

As more and more friends joined us we ordered more and more from the menu. At only $3-7 an item, this was a fun and casual way to eat. I tried the oysters and sampled the pork steamed bun and mini sub. Everything was excellent though I now regret not trying the grilled hotdog or the pizza pocket. Each offering evokes memories of a microwave more then haute cuisine but it's this playful juxteposition that also makes every item exceed expectations."}
{"text":"I've been coming here often, for over 6 years probably. I've brought first dates here (usually too loud for first dates, I've learned), small groups of foodies, large groups of non-foodies, and, most often, pleasantly on my own.

Steak tartare. Should I have a say, it will be my last dish before I die. The tartare here has been consistent since the first day I came here, and remains my favourite rendition of my favourite dish. Most dishes here I have loved. The others I have 'only' really liked, and even still, they're a few dollars each. Always a great range of beers available, and great cocktails. 

Being a chef of 16 years, I especially love that I can count on this place being open till 2:00am, and usually running into industry people.

Don't stop what you're doing. It's golden. Thank you for everything."}
{"text":"Amazing! The tapas- style food was incredible and the beer selection was impressive and eclectic. Mini Mac Sunday special was the best. 

Only issue is its hard to see in the kitchen where pure magic happens!"}
{"text":"Cozy, intimate tapa bar with a unique menu that changes up seasonally. Nice spot for a drink and snack."}
{"text":"We came here for snacks around november 2015, so this review is for the food only (we didn't order drinks). The only dish I liked was the eggplant sandwich. The \"chopped cheese\" was literally a tiny cheeseburger, McDonald's $1 menu quality. The alfajor was not good, and I've had a lot of alfajores around the world to tell (including Spain, South America, Asia, etc). The worst part was that cookie was chewy like a whoopee pie. Do you even know what an alfajor is? C'mon. 2/5 stars for food.

On the plus side, the ambiance was nice, and the bartender was making nice drinks. I can see this being a cute date-night hangout."}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar epitomizes Toronto food and they serve it up with style and panache. Multi-ethnic tapas size portions let you sample from the rich cultural diversity that makes this city the envy of the world. In spite of a sketchy location near Bathurst and Queen St. West, 416 has a wide open front when weather permits along with a friendly bouncer working the door, at least during those late night hours. The staff were hauling out incredible plates of snacks even though the 2 am last call was imminent and they were talented at slipping through the late night bar crowd using the necessary dexterity in the candle lit atmosphere. It was fun watching a cook arrange the dishes at the bar while enjoying the music provided by the DJ. 416 delivers!"}
{"text":"We came in on a quick bite on a Wednesday evening. Place was pretty packed. located in the hipster area of Queen Street West. The place is small and cramped for the most part. 

As we only had 30 minutes to eat we weren't able to try much. We ordered the korean fried chicken and steak tartare. I liked chicken but very disappointed by the tartare. The steak was overseasoned with capers and dijon mustard. The only thing I could taste was the dijon mustard, it was over powering. The chicken was not crispy like I thought it would be. It was almost soggy when it arrived piping hot. The sauce was really good though. We were also not checked on during our meal so that was kind of disappointing as well.. since we sat at the bar in front of the bartender.

I also wished they had a more extended drinks menu. Maybe some specialties for a unique style bar.

Don't think I will be coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Even with the inevitable wait for a table, I'd go back here again and again. Not for the quality of service, but for the beers, the SNACKS, and the speed at which it all arrives!! Never better. Plus, a consistent crowd flow always makes you feel like you're where the cool kids are!"}
{"text":"- hipster central. so good thing i was wearing my plaid shirt.
- if you can score a table, best thing is to never let it go. this place is tiny.
- food wise - pretty frakkin solid. i'd recommend the scotch eggs benny, bone marrow toast, and the lamb thingy... 
- just note that they dont believe in utensils here, so it's all fancy finger foods."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend to try this place and I absolutely love it! The food is incredible, many unique dishes with funky flavours. My personal favourite is the steak tartare - fined chopped beef seasoned with some sort of tangy sauce on a crispy piece of baguette. The only thing I would change about this place is the service, other than that the food and ambience is superb! Great place to drink and socialize."}
{"text":"Why?  Why a 5... Snack Bar sets it self up for perfection the second you walk in... Its everything you could every want... AND IT'S TAPAS STYLED!

This place is perfect for that relaxed, fun, and intimate dinner for two. The lighting is turned down to 'sexified', and the tables are flavourishly set with a single taper candle.... It's a Barry White song all funked up.   

Besides Snack Bar's classy trendy ambiance, the food is delicious, and it continuously pumps out a great selection of lounge/house music. 

Favs
The steak tar tar is a must.  If you like pate you'll love this delectable dish.  Also try the Pinot Noir 2008 (STRATUS)... don't question, just do it.

Recommendation;
Plan to go for an early dinner (before 7pm).  This place does not offer much in seating and will fill up quite quickly.

So just go already..."}
{"text":"Visited last thursday,this spot is right on the queen and bathurst intersection.A very tiny spot however bustling with people.If coming with a larger party its better to come in early to grab a table.They do not have cocktails.They have options for beer and wines.The portion size for food is minuscule however the vibe is chill.The music is a 10/10"}
{"text":"If I could say something positive about this place, it's that they will text you once they have a free spot, so you're not forced to wait outside.

They have this concept of not using cutlery, but the menu doesn't fit the idea. A lot of items are greasy or simply cannot be grabbed with your hands without needing excessive amounts of napkins, which are not provided because of the horrendous service. Not only is it extremely loud so the waitress does not hear properly what you are ordering, but she does not even bother to write it down and/or confirm it with you in this crazy loud atmosphere. As a result, we received 2x an order that we had not even asked for, and there was another item we simply never received. To add insult to injury, after submitting a second order we were forgotten about and only got our food 40 minutes later (we saw the chef beginning to cook it 20 minutes later when the waitress remembered about us).

Finally, when we received our food, it was a disgusting mess, a lot of flavor combinations simply didn't work and were a sign of poor design. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I woke this morning with two feelings. One being hung over and the other feeling so much love for 416 Snack Bar. I was actually surprised to read other people's reviews of this joint but I found it to be just the opposite of what most people said

I absolutely loved the decor of this place. Although it was  bar and it was crowded it was so intimate. Mood lighting and candles accented the room and even with it being rammed with people, I never felt like it was claustrophobic. They have really done a lot with this space. I don't remember it being that big.

We arrived quite early (8pm) and had a table no problem. With friends on their way, I started to worry we would lose their seats that we had saved. The servers reassured me all my friend would be taken care of when they arrived and they were. They went out of their way to get them chairs and make sure they were settled (let me remind you this was a bustling Saturday night). As for the service itself, I found them remarkably attentive.  They never let a glass go empty without offering another and were always making sure we were well taken care of.

Now on to my favourite portion of the evening... FOOD! Reading the people's reviews below regarding the portion size.. I have to say, COME ON! they tell you in their name they are a \"snack bar\" not a \"full Sized meal bar\" I ate ALOT here.. almost an embarrassing amount (but I felt to give an honest review you've got to try it all right??? .... at least that's my excuse). I had the Oysters to start with the Cava. I've had some pretty crappy Oysters in this city. They were the perfect size and were cleaned and laying on a bed of salty ice. They were served on a stone slab. It was brilliant. My BF had the Beef Tartare to start and it was the perfect appetizer. We then had the Charcuterie plate which the portion size was great and the Figs wrapped in meat.. delish!. Again, it was served on a stone slab. Next we tried the Scotch Eggs Benny which couldn't have been better and I had the fish Steamed bun (as per a servers recommendation) and it was equally amazing. My only not so great food review would be on the donut. One of my girlfriends got it and although the candy floss topping was delightful, the donut itself was quite bland.

As for the prices I didn't find them to be unreasonable. It was a perfect Saturday night."}
{"text":"The Spot: 
416 Snack Bar is a bar, that serves snacks. The premise is fairly straightforward, but if that doesn't sound like a winning combination to you, then maybe we need to rethink our relationship. Despite its limited capacity, Snack Bar has everything you could ask for in a local hangout: amazing food and refreshing drinks, served until last call; live DJs; loyal patrons and a sweet location just north of Queen on Bathurst. Landing gracefully between the worlds of restaurant and bar, it's the perfect place to stop in for a casual drink or some late night munchables. From the outside, simple aluminum siding and hand painted signage belies what has quickly become one of the premier destinations for the hungry and thirsty masses of the GTA. Once you step in the door, the interior aesthetic is a rough, wood, steel, and concrete homage to the city which raised us.

What's Really Good: 
Boy oh boy, the snacks... where to even start. Even though their menu changes all the time it is hard to go wrong. Staples like oysters and sparkling wine always hold down a spot, but part of the fun is just trying to decide what to order on any given night! You know its gonna be a great time when the biggest question you're facing is whether to get the trini doubles or the mini mac, the korean fried chicken or the reuben sandwich, or the fish, pork or veggie steamed bun. Honestly though, thanks to the snack sized portions, cutlery is hardly needed, and no one will judge you if you ordered everything on the menu!

You'll Want to Know: 
Straight up, there should be a 416 Snack Bar for every area code in the nation. Alas, there isn't, so this one can get pretty packed. The close quarters and intimate vibe keep it casual but at times it can get a little loud. If you're going on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday get there early. To be perfectly honest we would recommend heading over for a weeknight libation; you will be able to avoid the crowds, and lets face it, every night is better with some snacks. Like so many of Toronto's hidden treasures, you'll have to keep an eye out the first time, but once you're in the know, this is one location that you will find hard to pass by."}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar is a small little hole in the wall just off Queen Street on Bathurst. The drinks are always on point. I would recommend the Paper Plane. It has a bunch of unique beers to try and a great cocktail list. Both the servers and bartenders are extremely friendly. What I love most about this place is that the menu is constantly changing so you never know what you are going to get, but you do know whatever it is, is going to be good! It is a great place to bring a group of friends and order a bunch of plates to share while enjoying some music and drinks! 

This place is a must for people who enjoy good sharing plates."}
{"text":"All the servers are hot...especially Taylor, if you see Taylor throw ice cubes at him and then tell him he's hot"}
{"text":"We came for drinks mainly but ended up getting some tapas. For food we shared a ceviche and min mac (burger). The seafood of choice for ceviche was scallops put on corn chip (4 servings) with a cheese base and some citrus and scallions. Nothing special as I could hardly taste the scallops. The 2nd tapas we had was the mini burger and trust me its is mini especially for the price they charged. It was less than bite and had  no taste. Prices for booze were reasonable but by no means inexpensive. The ambiance is nice with a laid back vibe and live band later at night. Will I revisit? not likely as something that happened to an associate left a bad taste in the mouth as like or not customer is always right. The way they work hard for tips the customer in many cases works hard for their $$ as well!! 2 Star due to poor service."}
{"text":"I'm all about beer and complementing the heavenly drink with delicious snack foods makes it just right.  This place is always packed to the brim because their food is great, the beer selection is on point and the prices are fair.

You can fill your belly with beer and a plethora of small snack sized plates of food for easily less than $25.  They have a great selection of food from Reuben sandwiches to Korean fried chicken.  Everything on the menu is bite sized and it gives you the perfect opportunity to share with all your homies.  

The one drawback to this place though, is that it is tiny.  Tiny being it's the size of a typical Starbucks, but with 10x the people inside.  You'll likely be seated with random people you've never met in your life and rub shoulders, but it's all good because the solid food and alcohol will make you forget all about that.  Also expect a hefty wait on Friday and Weekends, this place is rammed, but Shawty I don't mind."}
{"text":"Very friendly service from the doorman to the waiter, cozy small and candlelit.  Really good food. I only had the veggie options, but the Eggplant double down was very good, loaded with sesame seeds, and the Doubles arrived with a fried bread that was hot and not greasy, with well spiced chick peas.  Definitely one of my new favourite spots."}
{"text":"This place is great.  When I have friends in from out of town this is our go-to place.  Everyone I have ever taken here loves it.  The fish plates are amazing and the oysters are always fresh.  Beer selection is alright but not spectacular (likely a space issue).  Go early-ish, it gets very busy."}
{"text":"This is sort of a 3 1/2 star review.  I was torn between 3 stars and 4 stars - here's why:

3 star reasons:  the atmosphere, for my tastes, is kind of eh.  You can't talk to whoever you go with.  It's loud, everyone's a hipster.  It's a place to be\"seen\", everyone's judging what you're wearing and whatnot.  I found everything was really laid-back, as in, they don't know what you ordered so they'll offer it to ten people before realizing it's yours.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of places where you have no idea if you're going to get lucky and get a seat - places that don't take resos, and are way popular.

4 star reasons: the food was solid.  I liked everything, although some things were seasoned too salty or not salty enough.  Stand-outs for me were the zucchini flowers and the reuban sandwich.  

We sat at the bar, so not a lot of comments on service.  A fun place to go for a quick bite to eat in between other things.  The mojitio was yum.  I'd go back, I'd just be more prepared for the noise level."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while and the wait was worth it! 416 snack bar offers up tasty morsels of Asian inspired cuisine. It's not a very big place, quite intimate so I would suggest this place for groups of 2-4, nothing bigger.  

By 8pm on a weekday this place is packed and buzzing with energy. We had the best seats in the house, right in front of the food prep area. Let me tell you, I would gladly volunteer as quality control cuz I wanted to take a bite out of everything! 

They have a few selections of draught, bottles and cans of beer, a pretty great selection of white and red wine, and good ol' hard liquor. 

We tried a variety of items: Lamb spiedini (lamb skewers with a mint sauce - this was their special thing), Wakame salad (excellent wasabi dressing), Pork bun (so so good, I could have eaten 5 of these), Idly Sambar (rice dumplings served with a lentil curry - the curry was prepared really well) and the cheese board that came with a selection of artisan Brie, Blue cheese and one other that I forget. The prices range from $5-9 per dish.  A couple honourable mentions since I didn't get to try these but watched them being prepared: steak tartare and the Latin heat board.   With all that food and a drink each our bill came to 45$ which is pretty decent. 

Service here is also fantastic. I must have asked a million questions about the food and preparation and they were so forthcoming. The food came promptly and our server checked in on us regularly despite how busy it was.

I'm told they will be freshening up their menu soon. Though, I imagine some of the popular items will remain."}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar is the kind of place you can go to enjoy tiny, tasty foods, well-made cocktails and excellent service (my discarded stir sticks were never on the table longer than 30 seconds) while oggling the crowd of young men who look like they may have at one point been involved in criminal activities but have since cleaned up their acts and now own successful, legit businesses while holding onto a bit of that bad boy aura that makes you want to rip off their short-sleeved yet tasteful grey leopard print button-up cholo shirts and have dirty sex in the bathroom (but you will have to wait because there are only two)."}
{"text":"This place is small. It is also awesome. And we're not the only ones that know it, so don't be surprised if you show up and it's packed. Getting in and finding a chair is totally worth it, though. Grab a 680ml bottle of old credit pilsner and sample some of their tiny amazing dishes - the pork bun, Korean fried chicken, smorgasbord charcuterie plate, mini-Mac (Sunday only!) and others are all so good you'll be arguing with yourself over which morsel to order next. I almost don't want to post this - you might be the one in the seat I was hoping to grab!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasnt for the horrible service.   The food IS amazing and its too bad they havent backed this amazing food with amazing staff.   I went with a group of friends early on Sunday for food and drink before going to a show.    We were there essentially when it opened and we were the only table for the first 30mins.  Even being the only table it seemed to take our server forever to take our order, when the food started to come we couldnt get her attention to get us plates, I had to find a food runner to help us.  This place isnt big at all, there was no need to be ignored as much as we were.   The best part of the terrible service---we asked for our bill to be split 3 ways (this wasnt a problem) our server brought the bills and walked away, eventually a food runner saw that we wanted to pay and offered to get the debit machine.  He inputed one bill in and walked away.  No one came by to help us out, so after 10mins of waiting we ended up inputting  the amount we each owed, printed off THEIR receipt and leaving it on the table and walked out the door without being acknowledged by any staff.   It was pretty bad.  Its really too bad because the food was amazing....maybe get take out from there?"}
{"text":"I under estimated this place to be a casual late night snack, it has very loud rap music, minimal seating and very salty food. Also hard to get service as with the miscommunication probably over the loud ( club volume ) music. 

 If your interested for a place to socialize and drink this may be more suitable for that. But however the food has no business being in the mix lol."}
{"text":"Started off well with the korean fried chicken, but the latin heat platter was disgusting. Seems like the chef was very confused with all the weird combinations that did not work well. This particular platter was very bland and was clearly experimental. The service was horrendous, as our order was forgotten twice and it took over 20 mins to get our bill. After a 40 mins wait, I was expecting something amazing but was terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"First night ever in Toronto, came for the great craft cocktails (mixologist Daniel great), and hipster tourism, but surprised this was also small-plate foodie heaven.  Korean fried chicken, seared foie gras, spicy tuna hand roll, mini-Reuben."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this wine bar...really reminded me of my fave dark, low-key, smallish wine-bars back in SF. 

I have to say though...i was completely misled by Yelp into thinking that this was a tapas bar/restaurant. We thought we were going to be able to have dinner here, but it was more like a really chill place to have a drink or 2 early in the evening and maybe a couple of snacks before heading out to a real dinner. Or a place to hang out after dinner.  
The description of this place on Yelp made it sound like a Spanish Tapas Bar...or at least a small eats restaurant- Not. 
It's a wine bar that serves tasty snacks. 

We didn't know that this was a sit-yourself type of bar...we stood awkwardly by the door with no one helping or acknowleding us for a few mins before we just decided to plop ourselves at a long table. 

Drinks were good and reasonably priced; my cava was perfectly chilled and not too sweet and we got a couple of snacks to share; the latkes with salmon + the spanakopita were tasty but very small portions- evidently, each dish is only good for 1 person/portion. We weren't told, so we didn't know. And no one else around us ordered food, so we were not clued in.  

The vibe on a Saturday evening was pretty low-key and it wasn't too crowded when we got here, so that was nice. Patrons are predictably yuppish, especially for the neighborhood, although...right as we left a Brett Michaels wannabe character (complete with cowboy hat, long blond hair and crazy boots) walked in with his friend who looked like a washed up wannabe Vegas cowboy. We had to take pics. It was too good to miss. 

Oh, and for those foreign tourists/out-of-towners...the name of the bar isn't Four-Sixteen...it's Four-One-Six...as in the area code of Toronto. Duh. We messed that up and had to be corrected by the owner. 
Sorry. 
We'll be back for a drink...and pork belly sandwich and bahn mi now that we know the concept..."}
{"text":"My favourite place in the city! Great vibe and wonderful food. Small, intimate and generally a line up but worth it. 
Couldn't decide between the Ruben sandwhich (awesome), steak tartare, burger with cheese sauce (daily special), spicy tuna come and spicy chicken so we had them all! Hard to name a favourite so try several. 
Will return!"}
{"text":"Only reason why I gave it four stars was because..
The wait to get seated... Too small and second.. Because the waitress didn't seem like she cared about us. 
Food was fantastic.  Had the fish platter and a bunch of different things.. Reuben.  Spicy tuna roll.. All amazing food."}
{"text":"Great spot! Good Service, friendly staff, tasty food, reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Definitely my kind of joint. Incredible atmosphere, fantastic music (DJ that night was playing eclectic funk, hip hop, glitch hop, and house), tapas were cool. Definitely going back, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This spot is dope. Was recommended by several friends. Went on a weeknight. Place was packed. Had to wait a little bit outside for some people to leave in order to be let in but it wasn't the end of the world. Was able to find a high top table. They played hip-hop and the crowd was young and service was prompt. Tried the Korean Fried Chicken. It was SOO good. A must try!"}
{"text":"absolutely loved it! great place, amazing to see what they've done with such a small space. Don't go there expecting to get a table soon though! Its a bar, you go drink and if you're lucky you find a table later and can order one of those yummy amazing tapas plates. They're very small, so again don't go there expecting to eat dinner. If you're just looking for a cool hangout bar in Toronto this is the place!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience with Barsa Taberna and our reservation there thus we cancelled and through google we found 416 Snack Bar and it did not fail us. A group of 4 ladies celebrating a B-day we were not disappointing.  The location doesn't do reservations but the service is good and food/tapas quick so not needed.  Smaller intimate locale with shared seating and laid back ambiance the food was good and the drinks plentiful.  Enjoyed our night here and would recommend for a laid back tapas style meal among friends!!!"}
{"text":"Was waiting for friends so I stopped in for a cocktail and definitely found a gem! Delicious tapas bar with a great wine and cocktail menu as well. Small place so best to come earlier in the evening if you want a table. Otherwise bar is nice as well. Staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Prices are great too vodka martini came to $12usd. 


The original yelp search had them listed as happy hour but I confirmed they do not have happy hour."}
{"text":"Hipster, cool, and interesting all things you can call 416 Snack Bar. They do a asian fusion with a splash of Mexican and then some European food to balance it out. Most of the stuff on the menu is $5-$7 and your milage will vary depending on how hungry you are. 

The Korean fried chicken was tasty and not over fried or under seasoned. Its a little expensive for how much food you get, but is easy to share with another person if you just want a taste. I also had a pork bun which was very tasty and full of that fatty pork belly flavor. My only complaint is that one pork bun is $5. 

The lushes of your group should be happy here. They have a bigger wine selection than I usually see in the bar scene. And they have a nice select of spirits, including some Canadian based tequila. The beer listing also contains rarer brews - my favorite being the only saison on the menu.  

I like this place for catching up with a friend or 2, or maybe even a date night. But with the prices of the food, it can get really expensive if you are hungry. $5 for a bun is steep when you can easily eat 3 of those and other items."}
{"text":"Wowee- this is definitely on the list for new favourite date places.

To be clear- this SHOULD deserve more than 3 stars from the avg yelper...but because there are other places in the city that I still like so much more-- and this place isn't particularly unique given the popularity of hipster-snack-bars now in the city..I'm keeping it a 3 stars untill my frequency @ this place bumps it up a notch.

In no way can I believe this place ever getting 1-2 stars.  And in everyway I understand and appreciate why so many yelpers give it 4 and 5 stars.

ok, rather than yelp about the tiny menus, good cocktails..all the random stuff that you will hear from the others'.. I want to talk about the space:


This tiny place has double seats against one wall, group seating against 2 walls, and a 3-sided bar in the back wall where there is an open-kitchen concept for the cold foods.

The side tables are great for a date where you might know each other better.
The groups seating is great if you are stepping in with a group for a snack before going out- but not really a stay all night place; and the bar- well the bar is one of my favourite TYPES of bars which very few places in toronto have.

The 3-sided bar is like...the OPTIMAL bar.  
The single length is good for singles.  The double length can be alright in a casual space; and the round/oval bar is the next best thing to the 3 sided bar but not QUITE there because corners are ESSENTIAL.

Three sided bars (i.e. the outdoor patio bar @ the Keg esplanade or @ The  Bedford Academy) maximize checking outage; socialization; and general romance.
The space in the middle is where a good bartender can really wow a crowd and definitely be the centre of attention with some charisma and flair.
And the open kitchen for cold-menu items can be a show in itself.
Yes, the 3-sided bar is where it is at.

Other Notes:
-Yes, food is truly \"snack\" sized but I prefer that since I like to taste things rather than eat a huge meal of the same note.
-This place is moderately priced... to expensive for what it is.  It looks cheap upon first glance but it really isn't.  You will be easily spending at least 50$ pp if you spend the evening here.- which is not outrageous but it's not exactly the type of incredible resto experience you wine and dine over 3 hours for.
-the chairs are small.  
-The bar has purse hooks (as I've said, purse hooks ESSENTIAL to a good bar)
-the service is kind but not especially go-out-of-your-way-chatty.  
-the bartender is not going to have a conversation with you.  This is not one of those bars- even though I did see solos at the bar almost pining for it.
-Kind of excellently located but not particularly good if you are on a bar hopping night.  Not too many great places to hop to easily within a 2 block radius.
-Overall a nice dimly lit intimate setting.  Don't pass this place up.  I won't be a regular..vino is still a bit on the pricey side for the ambience of this place...but it will definitely be on the list for future encounters."}
{"text":"Great food and cozy atmosphere!  Mixed drinks took quite a while to get to us, but the food was very delicious, so i forgive them.  The pork bun was a tasty little treat and i really enjoyed the foie something or other, can't remember the name..."}
{"text":"Really loved this place...plays 90s hip hop...serves great brews (pricy)...but the patas are totally worth it as about $4 a piece. the Bau and the doubles were definitly worth it. I have never had doubles thsi good in the whole city, the dough is so good. The bau was amazing . Loved everything about this place. Get there earlier as there is usually a line up."}
{"text":"Great place for late night cheap eats with friends. Too bad there's always a line up, so I don't get to have it as often as I'd like. Everything I've eaten has been a hit, great oysters, saganaki (so?), steamed buns, Korean fried chicken, steak tartare, tuna hand roll, etc. Snack bar is always a good idea!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Came back here to share this place with my girlfriend to share the great food and service I've experienced in the past. While the service was still up to par, the food was not. 

Got 2 of the chili chicken (one of my favourites) to share and there was a strange texture to it this time around. We didn't know if it was undercooked or just an off batch but we were reassured that everything was in order. Paid, left and that was that. My girlfriend and I got sick after that visit and thankfully no harm was done in the long run, but we're now 100% it was undercooked. 

I am pretty bummed since this was one of my favourite spots. Turned off from this place and will never visit again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my friend tuesday after my class .. was kinda hungry  & I love tapas places & had bookmarked this place. 

It seems from the pictures that the menu options change every couple months, & the previous months had the stuff i would have loved lol . 
Limited menu 

Must say, very small place, seats are very close together so be prepared to get pretty intimate with the 'table' next to you lol.  
This place is mad loud .. so you gotta yell your way through. 
Its a bar type feel so the volume may be okay for most . 

The food is VERY small portions . Pretty much just a bite . Definitely not to share . 
Nonetheless, it tasted pretty good for the most part . 
We got Octo Bravas-which i generally like octopus and squid very much-, falafal double down, not bad . Pakoras , pretty good. & we tried the special thing which was an empinada, loved it . 
Unfortunately i only took a pick of the octo-brava , which is a beaut, take a look haha

Did leave hungry obviously lol very small portioned 
But for drinks its probably a good option"}
{"text":"I had come here about a year and a half ago...and had a not-so-great experience. That time, it was really crowded, the music was way too loud (couldn't even have a conversation with my friends), and the lobster roll I ordered was $7 and didn't taste good.

Recently, I decided to give this place another chance. This time around, it wasn't crowded, the music wasn't too loud, and I ordered a bigger sampling of food off their menu. 

Tried the steak tartare, pork steamed bun, korean fried chicken, eggplant sangwich doubledown, infladita mexicana, and the portuguese rissois de camaro. Out of all these, my favourite was the korean fried chicken. We even ordered a second plate of it. However, while the seasoning of the chicken was well done, I found that the quality of the chicken meat was not great. It had a funny taste to it (but I didn't get sick after). The rest of the dishes were pretty decent - but nothing that stood out to me too much. Steak tartare came on toast that was burnt. 

In terms of drinks - the creemore amber was really good!

Overall a fun place to hang out and a cool place to take friends who are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Holy Hipsters!!! 

I found the new Mecca for foodie Canadian hipsters & it's called 416 Snack Bar

At 10:30pm on a frigid Friday night a bouncer was already guarding the front door like a hawk! And trust me, nobody was getting through this guy!

Luckily we got in before the obnoxiously long line started forming at 11:00pm.

Upon walking inside the very dimly lit and crammed space, I spied folks casually canoodling at the bar and others noshed on tapas style eats at bar tables scattered throughout the frenetic space. Honestly, this place looked more like an indie hipster lounge than a restaurant but it felt warm and welcoming for some odd reason or another. Anyways, with the one candle lighting my communal table, I quickly made my orders.  It didn't take long for our first few dishes to arrive, as well...

Bao - momofuku eat your heart out! This steamed bun was splendiferous! Stuffed with a fatty piece of pork belly, greens and hoisin sauce, each bite was glorious! The Bao was fluffy and soft and all I could think of was \"why did I order just one?!?\"

Korean fried chicken - these sweet and savory bite sized morsels on skewers had a surprisingly nice kick and the meat was well seasoned, tender and juicy!

Trini doubles was magnificent! Im not sure what this enticing deep fried sammie was filled with but it was superb! Great texture and incredible flavor!

Steak Tartare - served on a crisp toastette, the tartare was very flavorful and buttery soft! Loved it so much I ordered two!

Reuben - this mini sammich was stacked high with layers of warm & tender corned beef. Topped with a mini pickle, it more than satisfied my late night hankering for a fine deli sandwich!

Overall, I was very pleased with my late night meal here. Service was quick and I enjoyed the variety on the menu.

It's the perfect spot to sit back, relax and enjoy the pulsing music from the in house DJ! Just let the cool vibe wash over you as you nosh the night away!

Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"I went there with BF after drinking for the snacks on weekend. They were good. My favourite was the fried chickens."}
{"text":"The place is packed on weekends (Long line ups, very awkward especially when you're sitting right by the window where people are standing and staring at you as you eat). 

I've tried some of their appetizers but the only thing that really stuck out is the steak tartare...the bomb! I would go back for these bad boys.

Other than that, everything seems okay - you can get better food some place else - quieter, bigger portions, and a lot more affordable.

The menu is small, food comes in really small portions, a little pricey for how small they are. 

Not worth to go on weekends because it's crazy packed."}
{"text":"We go here quite regularly. 

Vegetarian Review:

Order the eggplant sandwich and steam bun....sometimes on they'll have doubles or a mexican dish as a special. Also worth it!

Drinks: 
-paper planes are a must. Ask for the \"air force 1\" if you're feeling like you need to get \"lit.\"
-tequila (Tromba) with verdita if you're really in the mood

Music:
-always great especially on the nights they're in the mood for 90's hiphop."}
{"text":"It was really loud inside the restaurant, mainly from the cluster of customers inside the small restaurant.  I found it difficult to hear even my friend who was sitting right next to me.  This is not a good place for a date because you'll probably end up shouting at each other and/or start nodding and pretending you understand what the other person is saying after a few times of \"What?  What did you say?\" in order to keep the conversation going.  It's a good spot for a casual hang-out though.

Their menu changes every so often and the selection is rather small (which made it easy on the kitchen to serve up all of the food very quickly).  There were no utensils on the table.  Everything was meant to be eaten with hands or the wooden picks which were provided.

We ended up getting most of the 'mains' to try but still shared almost everything.

The Foie Gras Torchon with Toasts was probably the best item all night!  This was a cylinder-shaped glob of foie gras served with applesauce and toasts.  The foie gras was incredibly smooth and so delicious!  I couldn't believe how good this was.

I was looking forward to the Korean Fried Chicken after seeing it on a photo on Instagram.  It definitely looked great and smelled tarty from the spices.  The chicken bites were more tough than I would have liked.

I ordered the Eggplant Sangwich Doubledown.  This was a sandwich made with eggplants as the bread with cheese between it.  It was okay.  The eggplant didn't actually taste like eggplant as there were some quinoa infused into it.  The cheese was very gooey and chewy.  I think I left this on the table for too long that when I ate it, it was already a bit cold and wasn't optimal.

I enjoyed the Lamb Kofta too.  There were two skewers of this so we split it up between the three of us.  The sauce was quite good too.

The Steak Tartare was unexpectedly served on two toasts a la bruschetta style.  This made it difficult to share between three people.  I thought that the steak tartare was okay.  Pairing it with the bread made the taste of the raw beef stand out less.

Lastly, we shared the Black Cod Onigiri.  This was perfect for sharing for the three of us.  It was adorable too!  The black cod was backpacked on to a piece of rice with seaweed like sushi!  This was really good too although it was definitely small in size.

The service here was excellent as our server was attentive and made sure our water glasses were full.  He also make sure to clear any empty dishes promptly too.

All in all, I thought that 416 Snack Bar was very expensive for what it offered (I split around $20 for my bill) and I didn't leave with a full stomach.  I'm happy I finally got to try it but I don't see a need to return for another visit at all."}
{"text":"This place has been on my hit list for a couples years now. My partner and I went at close to midnight (Sunday night) after the Nas and Lauren Hill concert and it was still packed even though it was technically a Monday now. Thankfully the kitchen was open. 

We had to wait 5-10 mins to be seated. Expect to sit closely next to others on a table of 6 unless you're okay with the bar seats. They really just have a couple tables for two people.

The ambiance is nice. Great hip hop music with candles on the table. The service was excellent! We got wet clothes to clean our hands with.

Many of the items on the menu were sold out for the night. And there are only a limited number of vegetarian options on this menus.

I kept hearing about the Korean Chicken. Although I didn't try it (partner did) I tried the sauce which wasn't great at all - what's everyone raving about ? My partner said it wasn't great.... I believe him. 

* falafel double down: was tasty and  had a hot spicy kick but not enough spice. 
* the eggplant sangwich double down was hot (temperature wise), the bun was delicious with filling and the inside was meh. 

Recommendation: maybe they can have the eggplant sangwich double down bun with the falafel double down inside-ingredients. That might bring the emerged product back to life.

Bathrooms were out of toilet paper and the ceiling had a crack in it. 

Confused about the guy standing outside the restaurant who was opening and closing doors for people
- wondering what his purpose is?"}
{"text":"An intimate footprint with an interesting mix of tapas style servings with drinks to be drank... 416 is the place.  Off Queen W near the north west corner of Bathurst, this place is just the spot to take a rest, have a beverage and get a refresher.  

We were three so we had a bit of a mix for our small plate orders.  Korean fried chicken (we literally just came from having it at Chimac too LOL), dim sum, foie gras, and two orders of arancini.  How's that for a mix of things?  

The fried chicken is in a bit of a tangy sauce kind of a sweet chili type.  It was good, boneless popcorn type served with two toothpicks which we sort of needed for the other things.  There's no cutlery here except for the spreader that came with the foie gras so we used that to cut the other apps up.  

The dim sum were 3 dumpling type stacks with 2 each for a total of 6 which works out to be about 2 bucks a piece.  They were good but dim sum is the kind of thing if you're like me you can eat like 30 of those...

The foie gras was served with a side of sauce and a good number of crostini slivers for spreading.  It was also good and I that spreading knife came in handy.  The arancini which were not on the menu (special) were also great.  Not as good as say what Libretto makes but better than decent.

Overall the food here is small because it's a SNACK bar right?  There's a good mix of things to eat with your drinks but don't come here looking for dinner unless you want to order a bunch of things and get full that way.  Of all the things we had here I think I liked them all equally and I can't say anything was amazingly great but all were better than just ok.  

Have a drink, have a seat, take a load off and have something small on the side.  Have a snack in 416 as they do that!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got to check out 416 Snack Bar! I really enjoyed my small bites. And my cider. And the tiny hole in the wall washroom which was surprisingly super clean. We walked in for a quick bite and ordered steak tartare, pork bun, spicy tuna hand roll and Korean fried chicken. I had the latter two dishes with a glass of cider (which was sweet and refreshing!). Both dishes were spicy but in different ways and I definitely needed the chilled cider to wash the taste away so I wouldn't have an overwhelmed palate. I really enjoyed my snacks. I believe my date found the steak tartare needing a bit of pepper, which they unfortunately could not offer him. But he still likes his snacks as well. The service was friendly and the staff are cool. We went early in the evening so it wasn't packed yet but there were a moderate number of people in there. Definitely will visit again as I understand the menu changes more often than restaurants!"}
{"text":"Dude, no. This is my desperate cry to please turn the music down and give some good service! Food is amazing yes but having to wait 20 mins for water while the bartender sits on her friends lap at a table is pretty pathetic. 
\"Sorry for the wait, ready to order?\" 
\"Yes\"
~dips for another 20 mins~ 
Ok sorry did you not hear me over the blasting ass music?? I also don't want to have to scream at the person across from me. 
When I ask for the bill it's pretty pissy when I see the server go into the bathroom after, take a million drink orders, serve drinks to tables of people who are smoking outside then sit on another lap and make me wait a quarter of an hour to hand over my money. COME ON. 
I'm home now and have a head ache from this music this is batshit."}
{"text":"Snack Bar is a cute little bar that punches above its weight. It has a very simple industrial feel. The service is attentive. The pricing is on the high-end, but reasonable.  During the summer, the windows are open and it is fun to people watch. 

I like the casual feel of the Snack Bar.  You do not need to dress up to go to Snack Bar the same way you need to on some of the other bars on King Street. Snack Bar serves great drinks and food.

The menu is small and can only be described as being eclectic. The menu is a blend of small bites. We had a platter of oysters. They were fresh. They went well with my drink.

I would recommend Snack Bar for a casual evening out."}
{"text":"Two of us came on a Friday night around 8:00 and the place was packed, although I notice this place is packed every night I go by. We had to wait 20 minutes for seats which got awkward at points because there was just so many people in this tiny little place. We were eventually seated at the bar, which was fine because the bar tender was attentive despite the huge crowed.

We opted for a few of the dishes but the star was the steak tartare. It was excellent with just a little bit of spice. The portion size was excellent considering the price. Speaking of the price, this place is exceptionally cheap food-wise but the drinks are average price.

This place would be ideal for a group of four, I found it was a little too loud and busy for a an intimate 1-on-1 night out."}
{"text":"Came here for a little food and some drinks after a concert at the Danforth on Friday night. It was super busy (we had to wait a bit for a table) and the music is pretty loud but it's definitely a cool spot. 

The servers were nice and accommodating however, I'm still adjusting to the fact that this place is utensil-free...

We ordered a few dishes -- I can only recall the Korean chicken, which was pretty tasty and the beef tartare, which I thought could have tasted better. I don't remember the 3rd. But everything came out quickly. 

This may not be my 'go-to' place but I can appreciate it for what it is."}
{"text":"I'm rather surprised I have not yet reviewed the illustrious 416 Snack Bar. 

This is hands-down one of my favourite joints in the city. It's good at all different times of the night for various types of socialization. Not only do they serve the most adorable and constantly-changing array of delicious snacks, they do so in style until 2am at affordable prices. 

If you want to sit and catch-up with people, I recommend going before 9, otherwise you will definitely have to wait for a table. It gets lively, loud and bar-like in there by 11, so keep that in mind. This applies for most nights of the week, and it is even busier on the weekends. 

A great way to start off is with oysters and Cava. I'm already drooling. Three perfectly chilled, salt-watery oysters from the Atlantic come with a fresh and crispy glass of Cava for a mere $13. 

Moving on, I must ALWAYS have the pork bun. I literally have had DREAMS about this delectable little guy and I ensure every friend of mine tries one when when he or she go there. 

Some other fabulous contenders include the new and incredible Korean fried chicken, greasy-yet-crispy mini Reuben, Scotch eggs benny and the steak tartare. 

You may or may not have heard about the Mini Mac. It is a teeny version of a Big Mac using quality (and mini) ingredients. It's not on the menu anymore, BUT I believe there are certain nights when they serve it on special, or if they have the ingredients they might make you one if you ask. Give it a whirl. You won't regret it. 

If you haven't yet been to 416 Snack Bar I suggest you get up, put on your coat and go there immediately."}
{"text":"It's small so the chance of getting a table right when you walk in is slim but I promise the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Place is dark and dungy but serves up delicious food. Food came quickly. Service is lacking a bit though."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here to eat, drink and shoot the shit...perfect for all of the aforementioned. I think we got there at a decent time as the place quickly filled...we probably arrived around 7.30.

As many have said, the bar is fairly small and there is not a lot of seating. I may have been mistaken but there may have only been one wash room...either that or I used the gents...not very nice!

That is forgiven for the excellent food I had. We tried the special, which was a mini big mac style burger - it's what a big mac should taste like! We also had the steak tartar, the Korean fried chicken, the Greek salad, the scotch egg Benny, the Reuben. 

The steak tartar was excellent, served on a toasted crostini. The salad was also really tasty, the Korean fried chicken is twice fried and served with Korean BBQ sauce. However the stars of the show were the Reuben and the Scotch Egg Benny. I am impressed by anyone who can serve a Scotch Egg with the yolk still soft, combined with the hollandaise sauce...it was orgasmic! 

Between my friend and I we had several drinks, polished off a decent number of snacks and our bill came to about $70 plus tip...which was pretty reasonable.

Service was friendly and spot on! 

Definitely on my to return to list!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a 4 if it wasn't for slow service and portion size/$ value combined....
It's a cute small place, excellent for drinks and a bite to eat. To my surprise, I would have say this is designed to be a place less for sharing, per say, but more for ordering many different things for yourself that are small portions.  I would say that you CAN come here with 2 people only and still get the same experience you would with a group (group is not needed). Or come with an even number of eaters. 

Hm, how do I explain?

Most of the portions are not shareable, and even if you can, you either have to suck it up and eat your friends half bitten food, or order another one. There are no cutlery (as per house rule) which makes a different eating dynamic. Yet, most portions are made for 1 person. Everyone on the menu is around $4-5 each. BUT, IT INCLUDES TAXES. 

It can also get really dangerous from a price point, about what you order, but I was pleasantly surprised with a food bill (not including drinks) came out to be $15pp (even with a $4 mini burger). If you don't like sharing what you didn't eat (yes, this was in the back of my mind) you may be paying a premium here. 

And we weren't hungry leaving the place either, which was really good!

What did we get:

 - Grilled Thing (daily item that changes) - today it was a quesadilla in a corn tortilla (i don't like the smell). some sort of indistinguishable meat product with lots of cheese - x4 slices (ask them to cut) in one order

 - Salmon Skin Bun - crispy salmon skin in a chinese bun shaped like a taco - meh, would have been better if it was warm x1/portion
 - Pork Belly Bun - similar to the above but with a pork belly in it - if you like Shanghainese Fat Pork belly (fay joo yook), you'll be disappointed with this  x1/portion

 - Scotch Benny (ORDER THIS!) - best on the menu - Semi boiled egg, covered in pork coating, with batter cooked to a crisp, smothered in hollendaise sauce - yum.  x2/portion

 - Scallop Creviche - cilantro crazy scallops on a tortilla chip - was okay, an acquired taste x2/portion

 - Steak Tartare - another acquired taste x2/portion

 - Italian Sausage - a mini sausage on a mini hot dog bun covered with cooked sweet peppers x1/portion

 - Mini sliders - a beef patty, in burger bun, with cheese and usual burger fixings $4 each x1/portion

 - Smore  - melted chocolate and marshmellow between two gramcrackers - the mmw was cooked on a fire. (x1 portion) $4

Note: it was only really the scotch egg benny, and the beef slider that really was a filing meal. If you didn't get this, you might be really hungry. 

It seems like the menu changes quite a bit, and the meals on the Blog, I didn't see on the menu. Don't be disappointed. Go in with no expectations.

While I was eating all this, the back of my mind wished that the prices were lower, or more portions on the plate. But thinking about it now, it wasn't that bad, and you can really go crazy to your heart's delight without over paying too much. It was just annoying to see the prices and the portion on my plate and thinking whether this was worth it. 

I would be more happy with this place if they had more shareable plates (like 2 on a plate) and/or they gave the diner a sense of the portion they will be getting. 

The staff here is friendly, and attentive when they weren't busy. We found a table at 6pm for 8 of us (but with bar stools and a very close proximity that  chatting was a little awkward, and you could only chat with the person you're directly facing).
Around 8pm, it started getting really full, and they had no time for us. The food came out slower and slower and it took forever to get the bill. Sometimes you had to ask twice. 
With a small menu, you'd think they would be able to handle it. 

Great place for drinks - lots of beer options like Mill Street, Duggan's, Flying Monkey, Speckled Hen - and lots of wine options. $6-7 a glass

It also got really really loud when full, to the put I think we were shouting at each other. 

Yes, this place forced me to live outside my comfort zone twice (sharing half eaten food, and paying for what I didn't eat) but I was very sated.  

Conclusion: I'll come back one day. Probably with one other person, and someone I wanted to have drinks and catch up on life. Or just the Scotch Egg Benny."}
{"text":"Had some cousins visiting from California and they said they wanted to try out a cool/trendy place for dinner, so we brought them here. The portions are not big as the food is all served tapas style, but that makes it great for sharing and trying a bunch of different things. Many of the items are inspired by various international cuisines, which is sometimes questionable because you don't know how good the quality will be, but I can say that everything we tried was made really well. A few of the items that stood out to us were the Korean fried chicken, steamed pork buns, octo bravas, and the pakoras. We also decided to try the jerk grilled whole fish platter which was also great, but a bit on the pricey side. The service was fast and friendly and atmosphere was good for casual conversation. Would love to come back and try out some of the other items!"}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar ain't joking when they say they're a snack bar. 
The portion sizes are micro-sized, as though they bought the \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" Ray-Gun off Ebay and generously shot all of their menu items with it (alright, they aren't thaaaaat small but you got the point).

Forget about sharing... anything. The food is damn tasty, so you won't want to share your one bite of goodness anyways. Keep those elbows up yelpers!

The place is nice, it's a restaurant I would want to own. I would of course turn down the music a tad bit, but that's just me, I like having conversation about the skittle-sized food I'm having. I would also expand the drink list. Just because the space is small doesn't mean I have compensate by having everything else small too. 

As I said before, the food was delicious but pricey especially when I have to order (or want to order but can't justify the price for) doubles of a dish.
The Kentucky fried quail was great, two pieces of KFC tasting quail served in a mini bucket. The Devils on a Horseback (apple stuffed prunes wrapped with prosciutto) were the best things I've had in a while. They sound awkward to put in your mouth but they taste damn good going in, and coming out. The zucchini flowers were good too, stuffed with cheese and deep fried.

Overall, visit the place. Go with 2 people (including yourself), an open mind and a very small stomach. Worst comes to worst, a McD's is close by (I personally had that after wards myself, confessions of a foodie)."}
{"text":"Cute little spot with snacks and dranks. We came on a Saturday night with a party of four. Queen Street gets a bit crowded but this place was packed but not too packed that we couldn't find a table. We were sat within 5 minutes. 

It's literally a snack bar so don't come here if you're starving for a huge meal. I ordered the Korean fried chicken and the flavor was SO good! Food came out in about 10 minutes. Our server was attentive and even let me sample the cider before tasting it. There's a pretty decent wine and beer selection. If all your friends have the same taste in wine, it may be best to just get a bottle. 

This place is good for dates. I didn't feel the music was too loud like the other reviewers noted. We could still hear each other perfectly fine. Maybe if you're closer to the speaker/bar it's louder and harder to hear. 

Also, even though the menu only lists beer and wine, they pretty much have a full bar so you can get cocktail wasted too if you're about that life. 

The candles are also a unique table touch."}
{"text":"I came here on a business trip based off a recommendation from my colleague. I loved the aesthetic from the moment I walked up and they played awesome music. The bartender (woman, maybe Rachel?) was so friendly and gave amazing recommendations. She even brought me a few dishes to try on the house! Great beer selection, phenomenal service, good vibes and unique, beautifully crafted dishes. Everything I had was very tasty."}
{"text":"Customer service is great. Music is great.. drinks are small ... tiny place, crowded.. low key"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto a few months ago with my girlfriends and we checked out 416 one night. I love tapas but wasn't particularly fond of this spot. I know tapas are small plates so maybe we shouldn't have stopped by because we ordered a lot of plates (we were probably hungrier than we realized). 

We tried the following tapas: 

Dim Sum Snack Stack - this was average in taste, pretty much what we expected 
Korean Fried Chicken - this was the only thing we truly enjoyed on the tiny menu 
Steamed Bun (Pork & Fish) - this wasn't as great as we had hoped 
Cider - can't remember which one exactly I had but it was pretty decent based on the waiter's recommendation 

The tapas bar is actually really small - we were a party of 5 and squeezed onto a table with two other folks. The staff is a little cocky when it comes to their menu; I wish they would offer more types of plates. I recommend you come here more for a drink than a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Small bar with Small sharing plates. The atmosphere is dark & edgy. There's often a DJ or live music. It's a very small, busy spot. The fois gras, spicy tuna roll and the Reuben are menu favourites! They change up the menu items really often! It's a small plate, sharing menu. If you're going with 2 or more people try the jerk fish platter. It's a whole grilled fish with lettuce wraps and various veggies. They have a lot of gluten free and veggie options available. It's a great ate spot or to go with a few friends. It's small and always busy so it's best to make a reservation! A great little bar with lots of options around to explore."}
{"text":"Not a big menu, but offers a different style of food. Small tapas and plates that sounded fusion and interesting. Two of us tried a whole bunch of dishes out, each one having to wait a long while for, but were a bit disappointed when each came out in a minuscule amount. I get that they are tapas, but at a price of $7-10 before tax, each of us needed to probably order 5 in order to get full and that would get expensive real quick.

The stuffed chicken was very mediocre although server made it seem delicious. Came out a bit cold and was literally done in one bite. The smallest chicken legs I've seen. Watermelon with feta was so tiny, literally four small slices of watermelon the size of your thumb and I was barely able to taste it to determine whether I liked it or not, before the dish disappeared. Foie and tartere my friend said tasted ok but was also tiny. The mexican corn were two halves and was quite good, similar to La Carnitas street corn. Handroll sushi was the smallest hand roll i've seen at $7 for just one.

A dark and cool atmosphere, but the high stools were uncomfortable to sit on. If you want to order a dish or two after having eaten dinner elsewhere, and wanted a bar to drink a, maybe try 416. I probably wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"Tromba tequila shots here are one of the best in the city.  They give you some sorta pineapple/cilantro/mint/cayenne chase with it which is an intoxicatingly lovely palette cleanser.  Cool vibe/music, super conscientious bartenders.. def worth a visit."}
{"text":"Just went here again for the millionth time. Amazing as usual. Bar was busy but not annoying. Tried the new Eastern Bloc platter which was good. Didn't really like the stuffed cabbage rolls though. Other than that a 5 star evening."}
{"text":"Visited from Chicago! Snack bar was the first bar my boyfriend and I went to when we arrived and made it also the last before we departed! We loved the atmosphere, the music, the service. What we really came back for was the steam bun and the tequila shots! Steam bun has become my favorite food I've eaten yet-and we are extreme (mostly vegetarian) foodies. When we made it back to Toronto we will make it tradition to make snack bar our first and last place to go eat!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I like this place.
Very happening little joint on a Thursday night.  I came here with the girls and we crammed ourselves in to sit at the bar for some lady eats, and can say that we certainly enjoyed ourselves.  Sampling a number of items, nothing really blew me away, however, the concept and the vibe was fun and casual, and this made for a great night.  Bar staff were quick and friendly, and cool.  
Good wine selection.
Tiny bathrooms.   Don't eat too much - no way you're gonna squeeze in there with a too full belly."}
{"text":"A small but eclectic hole-in-the-wall hipster bar that does not take reservations.  This is another tapas style bar with a very Asian-inspired menu.  Fun atmosphere with upbeat music blasting and the drinks flowing from the bar.  

The servers are always running around so it can be hard to get their attention but just be sure to say it loud and clear so it can be heard over the music.  The staff are friendly and I could see people coming here as their regular spot for drinks.

My favourites from the menu are the korean fried chicken (spicy and crispy), steak tartare (flavourful and creamy), and the steamed pork buns (juicy pork belly with pickled veggie).  Would not order the trini doubles again as it was just a very soggy sandwich version of a samosa that was way too spicy and mushy."}
{"text":"This place is busy ALL the time. You will most likely wait 15-20 minutes, but it isn't too bad since the wonderful staff will offer you a seat on the cil with a cocktail or beer. ( just don't hang your beer out the window). 

I simply love the tapas style food here. And surprisingly they have really yummy veggi options! My personal favourite is the veggy steam bun. It is perfection!!!! 

The staff is always super helpful with my 1000 questions regarding my veggy diet and that is rare. So thanks guys! You will most likely order 5 or 6 menu items if you have an appetite.

The very small establishment has very dim, romantic lighting and eclectic Nuevo- hipster decor. The music is a lovely mix of fantastic hip hop music that very far from mainstream and actually enjoyable to listen to. 

This is the perfect spot for a post- work pint and quick snack with pals. Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Cute quaint spot! With a minimalist metal gridded exterior, I almost walked right past it! 

The interior was rustic, yet sleek and modern. With partial wood wall paneling & ceiling, the other half black and raw. I simply loved the open concept square-shaped bar tucked away at the back and the multi-level types of seating arrangements.

The first thing that caught my attention were the tall white candles with their silver metal holders. What a romantic touch! Then there was the menu! Very clever design! Using an old metal clipboard, the pages were regular lined paper, with letters printed the old-fashioned way by typewriter? Beautiful!

It was a catchup date with my friend visiting from out-of-town. We arrived right as the doors opened, so we got first dibs on the seats! Choosing one of the bar seats for two, it was a perfect spot to people watch, and it amazed me that these bar stools were surprisingly comfortable for our 3 hour gabfest! 

TAPA STYLE
Be forewarned, this is a tapa-style bar! Be prepared to order lots and pay lots. Each dish ranged from $2-$9, but the majority of the items were $5. We ordered almost everything on the menu (except the $80 caviar). The food bill came to $80 with tax & tip. Everything was made very well and was tasty, and we were full and very much satisfied all night!

MUST TRY
Oysters - fresh, juicy, meaty, yum!
Pork Belly Bun - the bun was soft & sweet and the pork was deliciously fatty
Egg Benny - came hot, soft & creamy like an egg custard

SERVICE
Awesome! Some of the most friendly and attentive waitstaff in all of Toronto! Our water glass was always full! We always had food at our table and never any empty dirty plates. For 3 hours, that's service!"}
{"text":"Top 3 favourite in the city... great vibe, awesome food, great drinks. You can't go wrong with any snacks here. Favourites being the steamed pork bun, trini double, korean fried chicken, spicy tuna hand roll. 

It's a tight space, but always seem to find room for you.... it will never disappoint! Go NOW!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 5 but seating is hard to come by and the bar stools are butt killers. 4.5 I'd say.

First timer and I love this place, I did spend a pretty penny but the prices are fair, everything is including tax and each tapas plate is about $5 and a decent portion.

Beers on tap 20oz are only $7, sweet! 

I'll have to get a group of friends to come out the next time around but seats go fast.

I really like this place as unlike many up and commer restaurant it's actually decently close to DT core. 

Everything was fantastic, foie grais plate, oyster, pork belly, eggs benny and lobster roll, pics attached!"}
{"text":"I am starting to consider 416 snack bar one of my local spots :). After a few visits, this place continue to grow on me. Its casual but still maintains an upscale feel. Its a good place to go chill with a friend over a drink and maybe a couple snacks. I love their snack items :). I've tried the Scotch egg (sinfully good), eggplant sandwich, something that looks like asian dumplings, and other items I can no longer recall. Every snack is a delightful treat.

Its funny, I like sharing my treats with whomever I got with. But this place is strictly 'cutlery free'. We asked on our last visit what exactly this means, and were explained that they don't want us cutting up our snacks to share! Lol, very funny and somewhat silly. But would explain why we got an odd look the first time we asked for a knife to cut our wee sandwich. 

Anyway, despite the cutlery free controversy, I really do enjoy 416 and look forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"It's a yelper's dream. A small space with a local phone call booth, local beers, a number of high top tables, and the potential to smoosh up against friends you haven't made yet.

I wouldn't say that the price tag fits the bite sized portion ($4 for a tofu hand roll), but the wee bites are done well, the beer flows from a telephone pole (for realz) and Outkast blaring on the sound system makes this a well thought out hang out in my books. 

And besides, who needs cutlery when a hand roll (aka a sushi cone) or a banh mi(ni) me is on the menu?"}
{"text":"Perfect for smaller groups. Tapas and drinks were excellent. Service was fast. Really appreciate that they clean your plates away as soon as you're done. 5/5 would come back again."}
{"text":"Love this, hadn't been back in a bit after going once and really enjoying it. Small plates are ideal for sharing with one other person, not sure about how a large group would do that. Cocktails are on point, had a great manhattan, a fantastic digestif one with frenet, a nice pinot and tried some of my friends as well. Nothing that could possibly be called a bad match to what we were having and the bartender is happy to talk about what you might like. The food, love the korean fried chicken (who doesn't?), steak tartare is not to be missed, the fois is yummy rich and very well presented (the only dish that gets a utensil) they had a lamb splindini on which was well seasoned and tasty. Croquettes and there's lots of fun options if those things don't appeal to your tastebuds. Date night friendly despite noise levels of happy chatter as it provides a level of privacy for your own conversation. Went on a tuesday night, so the crowd issue was less intense, no waiting."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and both disappointing. I had to get up and ask for a menu. No one came to offer me a drink, had to ask for that too after 20 mins. After 40 mins had to ask if I could order. Food was fantastic but served to me with no napkin and no offer of water. You guessed it! Had to ask for those too. Just disappointing. You can make the greatest food and drinks in the world but if your service sucks then you're failing."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see how busy this place was at 10pm on a Sunday night! It was poppin to the point where I couldn't even hear what I was saying, unfortunately, so skip the first date here (I'm totally kidding). Vibes were reminiscent of the basement of my old house; rustic as everyone would call it.

Steak Tartare ~$7 - It was the best choice of the night. Refreshing meat with a spicy kick on a crunchy crostini. The bomb!

Korean Fried Chicken ~$6 - Definitely made fresh with a spicy honey-lemongrass sauce and sesame seeds/green onions on top. Very doughy breading similar to KFC.

Foie Gras Torchon w/ Toast ~$7 - Since I looked forward to this the most, it was the most disappointing as well. The toast was thin and crispy, but a tad too salty and too many huge holes. It came with an apple sauce to balance it out but it had way too much sugar in it. The foie gras was broiled at the top alike a creme brulee, but it had the texture of pig fat because it melted straight into my mouth, making me question its contents (and yes I've had foie gras before)

Food preparation was quick and efficient. It's a great place to grab a quick bite if you aren't too picky with quality."}
{"text":"I loved it! I went with one friend on a Monday right at opening which was a good idea, because  as we were leaving there was a huge line out the door! It was crazy! The servers were really friendly and knowledgable. We got a cheese platter, and some kind of crostini both were amazing, and they had a great selection of beer and wine. We had the \"peach pie\" for dessert, it wasn't the best, kind of like a toaster strudel, just really deep fried. But overall everything was amazing, just be sure to get there early!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE place in the city I have been here multiple times and it never disappoints and have tried a lot of their changing menu! No cutlery just small plates eaten with your hands 

The Korean fried chicken and hand rolls are ok nothing amazing. BUT their steak tartar is the best i haven't found a place that makes it like this, when they used to have trini doubles it was great too! The empananda was so soft. Their newest item is the Canadian board for $30 you get 4 oysters in bib lettuce cups, tourtiere, potato skin poutines, smokey salmon and a beaver tail! It was pure deliciousness! last time I spent $55 for 2 people on food and rinks before tips and was so full walking out!

Yes, there will always be a wait during Friday nights and the weekends. The best seat is definitely the 2 corner ones at the bar where you can watch someone make the tar tar, hand rolls and the oysters and chat up the chef, service is always great. However, the music can be quite loud and unfortunately the portions have gotten a bit smaller. Other than that I love this place! i want to go back right now while I write this"}
{"text":"The Korean fried chicken made me feel like I had died and gone to chicken heaven. Perfect bite-size proportions that ignite the senses and will dazzle your mouth. Cute and cozy, and the staff is kind and considerate. If I lived in Toronto, I'd be here every day demanding \"after eight jos. louis\""}
{"text":"What a happening place. My friend and I walked into this joint on a Friday around 8, which was primetime for a long wait for a table. No bother, we were here to eat and were willing to wait, goddamit! The people-watching opportunities also provided ample pleasurable entertainment in the meanwhile - particularly if you're into the bearded, thick glasses, knit-hat wearing sort.

Staying true to the fact that it was a 'snack' bar (also the fact that after an hour or thereabouts of waiting, we'd occupied stomach space with booze), my friend and I shared just a couple of dishes:

1) Steak tartare, twice - pretty darn tasty, well-spiced and tender. We ordered another helping of this dish and begrudingly again gave a half to one another the second time around. I won't lie, I seriously considered stealing her piece while her back was turned and blaming it on the person beside her.

2) Oysters, 3 of 'em- good. I speak from a biased perspective since I'm not really a big oyster fan. A refreshing break from the other richer dishes.

3) Scotch egg benny - believe what everyone else says, this dish was amazing. Extremely decadent, the hollandaise was buttery and delicious, while the eggs were contrastingly firm/slightly crisp. The whole dish just exploded with flavour and a delightful velvety texture in your mouth after biting into it. Yum.

Oddly, it got a bit quieter around the time we left (10ish). All in all, a great place to drop by for a drink and a delectable bite to eat."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day at TIFF. My colleague and I were tired, needed to eat. This place seemed good on yelp. Took a seat, no one came for a while, so went to the bar to order. No biggie. It's busy, I get it. But then at the table, no one gave us water, no napkins.... two different servers who I didn't even know who they were, angrily first words out of there mouths were, we're gonna kick you out if she falls asleep. Entitled hipster BS. Manager was pretty cool, but sorry, hungry homey don't play that. There's a limit. I'm turned off. Coming from Williamsburg, this place not bad, but really not all that. Falafel joint around the corner could have been chiller. Not a must, if you're from out of town. Go for authentic flavors in Toronto instead."}
{"text":"Good Food.
Romantic and hip.

BUT

Super loud and busy.
Extremely small and crowded."}
{"text":"Venue: 416 Snack Bar
Specialty: Bite-sized food
Dinning experience: Late-night snacks
Menu items: The Board and The Mini Mac

We don't have utensils. Said the server that was taking my order on a late Sunday night at the infamous, no nonsense, we-cook-what-we-love 416 Snack Bar. I laughed, smiled and looked at him in the eye (provoking intimidation), the server re-assured me: Our snacks are meant to be eaten by hand. To which I replied - then let's see those snacks of yours.

The \"416 snackers\" pride themselves on delivering bite-size indulgence to one's palate. The chefs come up with creative ways in which long-established dishes can be made into a snack, and therefore eaten by hand. The board, a quintessential dish that brings together a little bit of everything represents this concept the best. With it, one can indulge in a perfectly deconstructed Caesar salad, and though crouton-short, the sucker is packed with flavour. Or the good ol' deviled egg, which has been spiced with the purpose of creating flavour-explosion in one's mouth.

Right next to the devilish eggs, rest an ensemble of house-made pierogi that thanks to my alcohol intake, and excitedly reaction to the yummy treats, did not retain in my my memory...was it cheese or meat they were filled with? Who knows, and quite honestly, who cares!

Last but not least, and my favourite yet - the spicy tuna hand roll, Japan's perfect finger food packed with fresh ingredients and potent in flavour.

From fusion to traditional, the bar also prides itself on showcasing known favourites on the menu. Their take on the Big Mac is, well, a Mini Mac. It achieves the same addictive taste as the restaurant-chain kind, with the bonus of quality ingredients and a hand-made touch to it.

Though dessert was not an option that night, I'll definitely be coming back for it soon. Super curious as to how they will please my sweet tooth, sans cutlery.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Great little place for a date! Good food and cool vibe."}
{"text":"Love this spot - Great wine list / tasty nibbles and always packed.  Not really for dinner - but perfect for a pre-event snack, which is how we landed there.  Hard to get a table, but they gave us wine while we waited and the servers were chill and friendly.  Crowd is hipster and young - lots of thick glasses, sneakers and skinny jeans...but vibe is intimate and upbeat.  The energy at the bar is worth waiting for a seat rather than taking a table - great people watching - We will be back."}
{"text":"I kind of have a love and hate relationship with this place. lol. I have been here a few times for drinks (never had a chance to try food) so my review will be purely based on drinks, service and atmosphere. 

Drinks - Typical of what you would find anywhere. ie. they have $6 rail drinks, beers, etc.

Service - Fine for the most part. However, there is a guy who works there that I heartily recommend avoiding. I dont know his name but he is basically the only Asian guy working there, shaved head and muscular? Every time I have to deal with him, I get wrong drink prices and wrong change. Avoid! 

Atmosphere - Awesome! They have a great playlist (r&b and edm songs) with a real chill vibe. If you like being knee to knee or elbow to elbow with someone, this is a great place to check out. Great for dates or grabbing drinks with a friend. Dont come with big groups.

Note: There are long lines if you don't come early or make reservations (i think they now take them? not sure though so please double check if you go). Also, avoid washrooms here because they are tiny and floors are slippery. 

Despite any issues I might have with 416 Snack Bar, I would recommend this place for drinks!! Something about it keeps calling me back. haha"}
{"text":"Dang, this place is *busy*.. even at 9-10pm - there's a wait.  That's ok, it was worth it.  Kind of a sketch part of town, lots of hobos on the street, etc. but it's just off of Queen and pretty busy so safe enough.  Inside - small, very dark (anyone else care that they can't really see their food that well?), but surprisingly devoid of the stereotypical hipsters - maybe one or two here or there, but otherwise just normal people, a little on the younger side.

Service was great, sat on the windowsill and enjoyed a beer while waiting for a table.  Prices were admittedly on the high side considering the portions - but not completely outrageous.  Most dishes were between $4 and $7.. So on to the food..

PAPUSA vegetarian - not quite sure what was in this, but it was a little crispy roll with some veggies inside, possibly topped with beets?  Again, hard to tell in the dark, and the menus don't really explain much.  But it was definitely tasty 4.5/5.

SPICY TUNA HAND ROLL - the BEST dish hands down.  Had to order a second one.  The crispy bits inside gave it a nice crunchy texture and the whole thing was just mouthwatering.  Get.  5/5.

KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN - pretty good, nice crispy surface texture, buttery inside.  A little strong on the ginger in terms of flavour, but short of overpowering.. 4/5

STEAK TARTARE - served on a couple little pieces of seasoned toast.  For me, I would have much preferred unseasoned starch for this dish.  I could barely discern the tartare flavours from the toast.  Pass on this one.. 2/5

OYSTERS - sadly, the serving staff forgot about these and we never got them.  Too bad - so no rating on the food, and a slight ding on the service..

Overall, I enjoyed it.  Nice ambience, though a bit too dark and definitely too loud (speaking at normal volume was not in the cards), a little pricey, but the eats are definitely worth a visit.  Just be prepared to wait for a seat!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have great curb appeal but don't let that stop you from going in. The place is small so get there earlier to make sure you get a seat. The food are all tapas style and delicious. Make sure you try there desserts. Drinks are great and waiter are open to mixing different drinks. Service and the music they play is on point!"}
{"text":"Some delicious food. Small plates. 

I had the Korean Fried Chicken, spicy Tuna hand roll and a steamed bun w/ pork & fish (off menu). 

Flavors were perfect."}
{"text":"Whats up with not having any cutlery?  How do you share a key lime pie? 

Food is okay but nothing special. Long wait and serving is okay with touchy waiters"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with my boyfriend and the place blew me away. Excellent service, amazing food and an overall great experience.

I don't want to use the word cozy to describe the environment because it was more special than that. The place was unique and you could tell that everything was hand picked to their style.

Their menu consists of some of the most recognizable snack food from around Toronto but made with much more thought. From the Jamaican beef patties to the napolitano pizza pockets, it was the best of all worlds.

Dishes range from $3 - $6 per snack and worth every bite."}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar is a little spot with a lot of character! The style of dining is Tapas and they will not provide you with silverware as everything is meant to be eaten with your hands. This cozy place offers a menu that is very diverse and doesn't highlight one culture, however aims to bring you the best of the best! 

My favorite menu items we had were the dim sum snack stack, foie gras torchon with toasts, and lastly the steak tartare.

They do not accept reservations and are usually always very busy. Great place to meet friends and chill."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place way too many times and finally I can safely say I've visited 416 Snack Bar.
Your typical dark, hipster, somewhat-intimate, but loud dive bar, 416 SB is popular with the locals as it's serving some tapas and drinks with a twist.  Beware if you're not into sharing tables and sitting closely to strangers this may not be your place, however great place to strike up a conversation with random people.  Nonetheless 416 SB is a great place with a great group of friends.  
Service was great! and well organized, one person to take reservations, and the rest to take our orders.  Our waiter was efficient in providing us recommendations for us first timers. Below is the breakdown:

***Jerk Fish; lovely presentation and worth every bite of jerk flavor.  It's a fun dish especially for those who love to eat with their hands, great selection of condiments to wrap your fish in lettuce. 5/5 
***Korean Fried Chicken; served with sticks, it almost felt like eating general Tsao Chicken.  However presentation was bang on and portions were good, however a little too much on the sweet side. 3/5
***Oysters; Served typically on ICE, not much of a surprised, however it was worth the try.  Presentation was beautiful 3.5/5

Grenache was my choice of beverage....nice and smooth to compliment all of the dishes we had. 

Ambiance 5/5
Food 4/5
Cleanliness 3.5./5
Price 4/5"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time after seeing multiple Instagram posts of their tiny food plates all over my feed! It is kind of a hole in the wall - located at Queen and Bathurst and very non-descript. It's a small restaurant where you will probably sit next to strangers, but it has a great ambiance nonetheless. As my friend put it, everyone inside (restaurant staff and customers) looked like a fashion blogger or model. 

We tried a bunch of different dishes off the menu. My favourites included: Korean fried chicken, steamed pork bao, and Moroccan veggie skewers. We also tried the cheese platter, which came with generous slices of blue cheese, manchego, and brie, with blueberry jam, orange/fig jam, bread crisps and walnuts. It was DELICIOUS. My only wish was that it came with more variety (maybe 5 smaller pieces instead of the giant 3 pieces). We also tried the steak tartar was fairly good, and the scotch egg benny which my friend loved but I felt wasn't crunchy enough on the outside. For dessert we shared the berry pavlova, which was kind of a disappointment because the whipped cream wasn't sweet at all! 

Overall, it was a great dining experience and very reasonably priced for what we had."}
{"text":"Nice chill place. Good for groups because their menu is all sharing. Good and friendly staff, definitely will recommend it."}
{"text":"Incredible menu that was built for sharing. Also, be prepared to eat with your hands! 

The dim sum tower is a must try. Also, cocktails are properly made and beautiful. 

I can't say enough - if you're lucky to get a table you will not regret staying as long as you can to taste everything on the menu."}
{"text":"After a crazy day of TIFF screenings in the entertainment district, my friend and I decided to head a bit west of the area for drinks and tapas. If you're looking for superb customer service and delicious plates spanning many cultures, this is your spot. We arrived here around 7pm, as tables/seats became increasingly scarce. 

First, we had the no. 9 IPA accompanied with some sort of \"sangwich\" (which translates to \"sandwich\" in Chilean vernacular, apparently). We then opted for the Korean fried chicken (or the \"KFC\" hehe) along with an Eggplant Sandwich, Tuna Roll, and an Empanada. Everything we had was super delicious and prepared right in front of us at the bar. We finished our tapas with a yummy almond/raspberry biscuit with some sort of cr√®me fouett√©e. 

If you come here with more than two people or after 9pm, all I have to say is good luck finding a seat! This place is a rustic gem, and has been \"cutlery-free\" for many years. ;)"}
{"text":"Steamed Pork bun, Fried Chicken, Reuben were out of this world. An amazing atmosphere and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've tried coming here a few times before and it's always been PACKED.  It's a pretty small place that when I've come has had a lineup.  I don't do lineups (too old!) so I've always gone elsewhere.  Well finally I had the opportunity to check this place out (I came rather early - around 4pm-ish) and it was pretty empty (yeah)!.

Sat by the bar and ordered drinks and the spicy handroll tuna.  Now this is the only place where when it says spicy tuna it is SPICY and I loved that!  Small bites to keep you on your feet while drinking.  The food menu isn't extensive and it's all tapas portion sizes from what  I saw so if you are more hungry get a few items.

The space itself is laid back cool - the bar and a few tables with a big screen tv (was watching the Jays game).  Music, good food and drinks and just the lively atmosphere makes this a great place to stop by and chill - especially after work!

The servers are pretty friendly and are willing to take the time to answer questions you have about the drinks/menu.  I'd love to come back here again and just sit and people watch while sipping on something delicious!"}
{"text":"so its to my understanding that they have removed the MINI MAC from the regular buuuuut now only have it on sundays........enjoy one, enjoy many!"}
{"text":"Alright I think it's time I finally reviewed 416! I held off as long as I could about spreading any word but it's spread beyond anything I can contain (plus it doesn't help when I bring new people here weekly).

416 Snack Bar is probably one of my top 3 favourite bars in Toronto (possibly my favourite) and for a tons of small reasons. There's just an amazingly cool vibe when you're in here and I'm not sure what it is but it's very unique! When it gets packed and every table is filled with people chatting and laughing away, there's an incredible energy you get from the space.

Plus it does't hurt when they have amazing food to much on while your having a drink with friends. It's important to note that this is a 'snack bar' not a restaurant so don't expect full out dishes to be served here (dishes are $6-10). Everything is finger food, bite size dishes and they're absolutely delicious. The menu gets rotated around every so often with new dishes so I can't particularly point out anything specific but I have yet to have a single dish here I didn't like.

They also have a great wine and beer list (yes they still serve Duggans here) with skilled bartenders if you want to grab any specific cocktails.

Regardless wether it's after work, a predrink before heading out or post (early-ending) party, 416 is the best place to head to with a few friends."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun place to have a few drinks and a few snacks, this place is hard to beat.  They have all sorts of interesting snacks, from a pork belly snacker to home made pizza pops.  The price of beer is not too bad and the service staff was friendly and will help you make choices from the menu. For your first time, the novelty is pretty fun, for any other time, it's a cozy place to have some snacks and drinks."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Toronto after getting into town. We heard raves about it and thought this would be good start to the trip. 

This swanky loud dark hipster eatery playing lounge music with communal tables was all about sharing. We went there late and still had to cue up outside. Thankfully, it wasn't cold. The wooden table topped with wax dripped candelabras. The food was of eclectic but mainly Asian. The cocktails were just as good. While some have raved about the Korean Fried chicken(Bonchon NYC) was certainly good but by no means the best I've had. The pork buns were equally as good but again wasn't the best(Ippudo NYC). That aside Snack Bar is a vibrant fun place to hang out with friends with food and drinks that are pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Expensive but delicious and great for small groups of friends. You pay a lot for a small portion but it's not expensive if you're sober and keeping track :p"}
{"text":"HOT DAMN. 
If you plan to come here, make sure you're dressed properly to wait at least 15 minutes in the cold. Not that this place is cold. There's a reason why you're waiting. 

Once you do actually get in, you notice it's a bit cramped but for some odd reason I really liked it. It felt cozy. It felt like you can mingle with the stranger next to you. It felt like you were so close to the person you're with now than a moment ago. 

It's definitely a louder bar, but it's worth the place to go. 

On top of that, as the name suggests, the snacks here are the greatest. It has everything you could possible crave in Toronto from poutine to kimchi to curry. The menu is versatile and changes every week or so. It's made by chefs that specialize in whatever snacks the bar offers so you know it's legit and not the same guy trying to make everything taste ethnic which can't happen. The snacks are made by chefs around Toronto who want to showcase their certain food. 

The only thing i would have to pick on is the prices. It is kind of like a tapas bar so things can add up and get a bit pricey. 

Overall, it's definitely worth it to check out. This place is a gem in Toronto and the place to eat and meet new people. I mean what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Came in on Wednesday evening around 7pm, the place was super small, hard to find because you can hardly spot it from far away as the entrance looked like any other ordinary small store located downtown. The place had barely any tables for customers to sit at, the bar had some seats but it was tight next to each other. Very hard to differentiate between servers and customers as we were not greeted as we walked in and stood around in the middle of the place once we entered waiting to be seated, which was extremely awkward. Music was really loud so it was pretty much impossible to hear the person next to you. There was ZERO ventilation at all!! With a place so small and filled with people especially in the summer, it just doesn't feel to good to sit in a sauna to try to eat.

The menu is EXTREMELY LIMITED!! Less than 10 food item choices and very limited selection of beer, more for wine that was sold in bottles.

As we didn't have much time to eat, we quickly ordered 2 snacks off their menu. The Korean fried chicken and steak tartar. I was expecting a bit more food on the plate as reflected the prices they charged. The fried chicken looked appealing to eat but only around 8 small pieces. The chicken was over fried having a tough chew to it, but at least it was tossed in the sauce well, saucy enough. The steak tartar was DISAPPOINTING!! For $10, only 2 pieces of cristini with some raw steak mix on it. The mix was yellow with barely any steak, it was mostly covered with dijon mustard and capers thus those 2 were the only 2 flavors which you can taste when you eat it! 

The interior design looks decent, I wouldn't describe it as hipster, just a bunch of random designs here and there, random chinaware for this and that. 

I WOULDN'T recommend this place, far better options to spend you money for a comfortable, less stuffy, better service place with more selection of food and drinks with better quality.

A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT  as I saw so many reviews of this place."}
{"text":"My Asian roots really contribute to my love for all things tapas. Yes, I am greedy when it comes to food because I want to eat EVERYTHING.

Loud, chaotic and cramped is the best way to describe the atmosphere. But damn! The food is good and the drinks are even better! It's a great place to visit if you're bar hopping in the area but I wouldn't say it's the comfiest place to chill all night either.

The food is tasty and the prices are very reasonable. This place serves it's purpose well. A place to grab a quick bite and a few good drinks with a friend or two (I wouldn't recommend big groups) before heading out to the next bar in the area.

This is definitely one of my go to places for drinks in the area."}
{"text":"The place is really loud and a little cramped, but the food and drinks are amazing. There's something for everyone, and they have a good selection of \"snacks\" for vegetarians.

I like that some parts of the menu change over time. That's how you know this place is legit."}
{"text":"Food is nicely priced and tastes great! the only set back is the cramped seating arrangements. 

I particularly liked the Ruben sandwich, and the Korean fried chicken was OK, but I have had better."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place twice and both times were on a Monday -- It was packed on both of these nights, which gives you an indication as to how popular this place has become already. And I plan on hitting this spot up on future Mondays because the DJs are ridiculous, playing hip-hop, funk and rare grooves.

Though it shouldn't really be relevant to the greatness of this place, I have to admit this venue was crawling with incredibly good-looking girls -- including a stunning female bartender. Definitely a plus for the fellas!

Okay, so the atmosphere is warm -- literally. Seems like the kitchen might not be very well ventilated and gets super hot in there when waiting for the washroom or hanging around the DJ booth. Sort of made me feel a little dizzy at times and hopefully something they will fix before summer hits. If you're lucky enough to get a table I am certain it's a much more comfortable temperature near the front.

They have some pretty great beer available including L√∂wenbr√§u and some giant bottles of organic UK beer which name escapes me right now. They also have a couple of draft beers on tap that come out of a tree log!

The snacks... I've only had the Jamaican patty and the pizza pocket and both were delicious -- especially after a few drinks. And as far as I know the kitchen is open until 2:00am, which is brilliant.

Definitely into this place right now. Not sure what chaos goes on during the weekend but given the fact it's a hot spot I would think it could very well be a zoo on Friday and Saturday. I just hope that fine bartender is working next time I go!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  

There was a good variety of options food wise and the flavours were quite complex.  I like how there are items that change daily.  

A great place to go with a group, try a bunch of things and share.  I love tapas for that reason - you get to try so many things.  

I was stuffed at the end of the meal and thought it was going to be quite expensive, but it wasn't at all, very affordable.  

It's very trendy, so be prepared to get their early or wait a bit for a table."}
{"text":"We went to 416 Snack Bar on Saturday after 6:30pm and did not have to wait. To my surprise, there were multiple tables vacant. The place itself was small, but had a cool rustic feel. I have to say the two washrooms were really unique -very small, but everything was placed efficiently. It reminded me of a washroom in Japan. The food came very quickly and the waiters were always around to refill our water.

We ordered:
Eggplant sangwich double down ($4) - this was my fave dish. The eggplant was deep fried and tasted amazing. Price is good for this dish. A must try (A+) - shareable between two people

Spicy Tuna Handroll ($6): This was not worth $6. The ginger overpowered the tuna so I didn't really tasted the tuna. They didn't put a lot of tuna in the handroll either. The only unique thing about this dish was that they put taro shavings in the roll, which gave it a crunchy taste. (B-)  - not sharable 

Korean Fried Chicken: ($5) Very spicy - be careful if you aren't a fan of spice. A tip to the resto is to put on the menu that this dish is spicy. I drank a lot of water because I don't handle spice well. However, I have to say that the spice was nicely paired with the chicken so I recommend this for people that like spice. (B+). - shareable between 2-4 people. 

Empanada: ($5) - the crust was crunchy, which was good. The filling was okay. Nothing special - a small piece of egg, olive and some pork. What made this dish was the sauce that it came with. A curry type sauce. (B) - shareable between 2 people

Steak tartare ($7) - didn't have much taste compared to other steak tartare that I have tried. The bread was very crunchy. My least fave dish and at $7, not really worth it.  (C) - sharable between 2 people

Special thing (changes all the time): Deep fried Kimchi pork belly bao (bun): ($4.50) This was very good. The deep fried bun had a sweetness to it and the pork belly and kimchi were a good pair. Very spicy. Please ask about spiciness beforehand if you are not a spice person. I had to drink a lot of water to compensate. (A)

We spent about $37 on this meal. The price on the menu actually includes tax already (e.g. a steak tartare is $7 with tax included). That's kinda neat. Never seen this at a resto before.

We didn't leave full and had to head over to bahn mi boys for a top off. I would say this is a good afternoon, after work snack place, but you will probably need about 4-5 dishes alone to get full. We shared everything so we probably would have been good if we ordered 2 more things, but at this point, we already tried most of what we wanted on the menu. We didn't feel like paying more. Some things on the menu were reasonably priced, but others weren't worth it in my opinion. I forgot to mention that you eat with your hands. There's no utensils and some of the food can be very saucy or oily. So for those of you phone addicts, you may need to go dark for 30 mins at this place ;)

Overall, I give this place a B."}
{"text":"This mini-resto/bar at Queen and Bathurst is what I would call \"dive-chic\". 

Digression: Reviewers below complain about 'hipsters' (I'm getting so sick of that word btw) but I see them simply as cool boys / beautiful girls in their 20s and 30s. To my fellow Yelpers: What makes these people hipsters? The fact that they have an urban sensibility? To me, the pejorative word \"hipster\" means someone who has an \"I'm cooler than you\" attitude. Did you speak to everyone at 416 Snack Bar to assess whether they're all douches? If not, the hipster factor is irrelevant.

Anyway. Dark, divey yet still somehow sexy interior...There was no bouncer on the night we went (Fri at about 10:15pm) and the DJ in the corner was spinning some loud, sweet old-school hip hop etc. The place was pretty rammed.

Seating is limited, so if you go during peak hours be prepared to hover awkwardly in the middle of the room before scoring a table or a seat at the bar.

At any rate....the limited snack menu of mostly high-calorie options are FUCKING WICKED-ASS. Sorry :) They are truly that awesome. Plus, all are \"cutlery free\"! Cutlery is so overrated.

Crispy morsels of boneless Korean fried chicken-on-a-stick are doused in sweet-spicy sauce and are highly, highly (highly to the power of awesome) addictive. Cantonese shumai (dumplings, essentially) are moist and superbly flavourful. The mini reuben sandwich is OTHERWORLDLY. Didn't try the scotch egg benny or oysters, but will do next time.

Nice wine list to boot, featuring some great Canadian wineries (Organized Crime, Rosehall Run) and they even have Ontario's Waupoos apple cider on draft! Impressive. I'll be back for more apres-joint snacks for-fucking-sure!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food!  everything we tried! Really cool space & great service, definitely on my list to visit again!"}
{"text":"Good service,location and fun atmosphere. I came on a Tuesday evening around ten pm and the place was jammed! I think I would come back for drinks and maybe snack, but not dinner as I foolishly did. disclaimer is in the sign! We had to order eight items to fill up, but at least got to try almost everything on the menu. Rubens were by far my favourite, along with the trini double. A bit pricy for the size, but tasty."}
{"text":"Servers can be inattentive and rude at times, but I forgive it because this place has the best steak tartare I have ever had! Also love the Tromba shots with the \"green\" shot (cilantro, lime, lemon, mint). 

Great place for a date, not for large gatherings."}
{"text":"This is hands-down one of my favourite places in the city. I've been coming since it opened, as it's a stone's throw away from one of my friend's apartments. I go less these days, because it gets packed to the gills almost as soon as it's open for the evening. Arrive right at 5 if you want a seat and quieter atmosphere.

The menu changes constantly, but the Pork Belly bun is one of the greatest things I've ever tasted and they never take it off. The oysters are my other weakness. They do almost everything extremely well. I'm partial to getting glasses of prosecco while I'm there, but I had an old fashioned once which was nice.

You can order off-menu too, if you're a regular. 

The two owners are incredibly friendly and learn your name fast, only after about 2 visits. They treat their regulars very well! Extra servings of food and new dishes to sample if you're lucky enough to be familiar to them. 

The waitstaff are mostly attentive, but it gets so jammed in there that it must be a fire hazard so I can understand if things move a little slowly sometimes. Great hip hop music is usually playing, very good DJ!

I hope they expand somehow, they could use the extra room these days. I'm very glad they're doing so well though, they deserve it. 

Go early if you want a quiet environment, go later if you want a party and a couple drinks, but know that it's POPULAR!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I did not know what to expect from the mixed reviews. But, I'm visiting TO this week with my sister and I am determined to take her on a culinary advernture.  So we walked the 2 km, in heels, to 416.  Once we had a seat, it was obvious this place was very local and anti hipster. Thank G*d!  So we saddled up to the bar and promptly put the wrapper from a bandaide (major blister on my foot due to the schlepping) on the bar.  Our wine-tender, Adrien, said without missing a beat, \"Can I get you something to drink or maybe some Polysporin?\" Immediately, we felt at home!  And, as it turned out, Adrien was very knowledgable about the the wines and small plates. He was passionate and sincere about each of the whites I asked aobut. I love the absence of pretense because then I don't feel like it's a sales pitch. Adrien even challenged me to try the salmon skin steamed buns. I am not a big fan of (fatty) salmon skin... but he said, \"... if you don't like it, I'm buyin'!\"  He even went on to explain the process of how they prepare the skin so it's not fishy or overyly fatty tasting.  Well now I HAD to try it. And, it was hella lot a good! Everything we tried was delightful and just the right portion. I mean, who needs to eat until they burst? I just don't understand why people are complaining about not being fed enough. My sister and I ordered 7 small plates and we were completely satisfied.  In reality, this is plenty. If you want volume, go to Home Town Buffet or Swiss Chalet. If you want epicurean tastes to complement a tart, yet buttery white, and thoughtful service - go to 416 Snack Bar."}
{"text":"Loved the food there! The tomato toast was especially amazing, as well as the eggplant double down. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I came here expecting some sort of decor related to Toronto (except for this washed out chalk drawing of the TTC subway map).  Otherwise, there wasn't much relates to Toronto...  The place was fairly grungy - my friend was also confused about the decor.

My friend and I tried the following things:
1) SCOTCH EGG BENNY: this was probably the best thing that they served there. I've never has a scotch egg before, so this was a nice litle snack to have.  The hollaindaise sauce was delicious on top of the egg and the ham.

2) SCALLOP CEVICHE:  It was quite delicious with the lime and the scallop; however - prepare for tiny tiny portions.  

3) WHITEFISH PASTRAMI: Whitefish, with beets and cream cheese on rye bread.  It was pretty good - however, REALLY tiny.  When it came out, my friend and I gave each other a look where I'm pretty sure we were thinking, \"... Where's the food?\"

4) STEAK TARTARE:  It was pretty good - toast was a bit burnt on the bottom though.

I have to keep in mind that the food is mainly snacks - but really - I found it to be really overpriced in a lot of the things.

It's a great place to have a drink after work though.  But it was really hard to converse with my friend when their music was pumping up so loudly in the restaurant.

... And can someone explain to me why there is no cutlery at this place?"}
{"text":"@416snackbar #YELPTO #TORONTOLIFE #SNACKSCENE #SNACKING

I don't mind the intimacy at this place - it is really small, dim and the seating is pretty varied with and tight. I am yet to try the food but I went for 2 rounds of drinks and it was pretty nice. The server was great and took his time to explain items from the menu. 

ANKIE TIP: The owner of this place is on a lot of dating apps. LOL."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit to the 416 Snack Bar while in Toronto. I would have rated this place a 5 star but the place is pretty small and we were told that we could stand and wait for our table next to the bar. There weren't any spaces at the bar so we were awkwardly standing in the middle of the restaurant dodging employees trying to serve their tables. Thankfully we were seated in about 20 minutes. I ordered the steak tartar on lettuce and my friend ordered the chili chicken(?). The steak tartar was absolutely amazing and flavorful; I'd highly recommend this dish. The drinks were also very good as well!"}
{"text":"If you like rap music, wine, and delicious snacks this is the place for you! I loved the atmosphere and I will definitely come here again. A great place to feel truly integrated in Toronto culture. I recommend the the Korean fried chicken! Again the music is on point."}
{"text":"Loved it! Ordered the pork bun, Korean fried chicken and the empanada. Everything was amazing but the empanada was definitely my favourite. Came with a great hot sauce. Good wine selection, service and the decor is really cool. Will definitely be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"After months of popping into a completely full 416 Snack Bar and walking right back out (I'm a constantly hungry and impatient girl, so I refuse to wait for food when there are other options available nearby), I finally got a table in this hotspot on a rainy Tuesday. Anyway, SO GOOD. My date and I tried a decent portion of the menu, but our favourites were the Korean fried chicken and the Trini doubles. The quail, reuben slider and tuna hand roll weren't too shabby, either. Don't come here on a completely empty stomach, nor an empty wallet. It's a fun place to come with a small group, late night, in between dinner and a night out on the town.

Fun little detail: They've made their own 416-appropriate version of a San Pellegrino label, in which they serve water. I'm all about the little details... I appreciated it :)"}
{"text":"The tapas were good but nothing really special. Would have enjoyed some other tapas place more. I wouldn't go back by choice."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I was truly sceptical the first time I saw this place. It felt rowdy so I didn't know what to expect with the food but it is truly amazing. 

The oysters are fresh and delicious and for 45 dollars, you get a bottle of bubbly to accompany them. 

I have had the watermelon salad which was good. I am not a watermelon fan which is why I didn't think it was great. 

The cheese platter is great as well. 

The fish sandwich and the eggplant parmigiana is out of this world. 

One of the best culinary adventures to have in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I stumble upon a gem of a bar/restaurant completely unintentionally and am immediately pleased with myself as if I somehow plotted its discovery. This snack bar has such a wicked selection of snacks and drinks that I will definitely return despite hands down the most annoying stools in the city. They should really do something about those.

My friend and I ordered the fish platter and mowed it down like we hadn't eaten in days it was that good. I personally did not come up for air. My friend and I agreed after we both could have ordered our own platter and we might next time. Sooooo good. We left inspired.

They need more comfortable seats though."}
{"text":"Stopped by snack bar on a week night while I was in Toronto for work. A waiter at the restaurant we ate dinner at actually recommended this place so we figured we would check it out. Walking in the place first struck me as small but the music was good and there was a pretty decent crowd considering it was a weeknight. 

We we're able to grab a table and order some drinks and snacks. We tried a bunch of different things on the menu and all of it was delicious. A dj cam through a little later and started playing some chill hip hop which I loved. Next time I'm in Toronto I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little bar/tapas place on the corner of Bathurst and Queen Street. It's a small place and has a grungy kind of feel to it. 

I heard so many rave reviews about this place so I took it upon myself to try it out. 

And honestly... the food left something to be desired. 
Had the Jerk fish platter which is essentially a make your own lettuce taco with some slaw and a slab of pickled veggies. Not a fan.  
Also had the Korean Chicken - didn't even finish these, it tasted like someone who tried to do an Asian fusion dish but just couldn't get the concept right. The flavour was just off putting but they did look visually appealing.  
Then had the Octo Bravos - they weren't bad but it just didn't quite hit the mark either. Almost tasted as though someone haphazardly threw some ingredients that tasted well on their own but fit awkwardly together. 
The double down eggplant - was the only thing I found to be tasty.
Beef tartare - was missing some acidity. 

I think the concept of eating tapas is awesome and the idea of eating only with your hands is fun as well. 

Would I come back? Probably only for a late night snack when everywhere else is closed or only for drinks."}
{"text":"Great food. Creative ideas. Well executed. Good draft selection. Music bit too loud. Friendly waitresses."}
{"text":"best spot i went to on a recent trip to Toronto. i was very impressed. once you get used to loud beats and inevitable shouting of everyone in there to be heard by their co-diners its was an excellent vibe.

the food comes small but plenty. having a vegetarian in tow we went full on that option plus the fried chicken, pork and fish buns, a real special stuffed yorkshire pudding and a great steak tartare. 

great (strong) drinks, the service isn't particularly friendly but its on point and quick, sh*t i'd assume they're always v busy. 

not that big so worth booking ahead. totally worth it. 

oh C$260 + tip for 4 of us, not cheap but we went heavy on the drinks."}
{"text":"I have been to 416 a few times now and this place never fails to disappoint. I have tried pretty much everything on their menu and loved them all. It's atough to round it down to a favourite, but i would recommend the below over anything else:

Pork Bun
Reuben Sandwich
Steak Tartar
Empanada"}
{"text":"First experience here was great. 
Second was not. 
First time: fast and courteous service. 
Second time: server pours the water so freely, doesn't care that it's spilling around the table and didn't even apologize that he spilled over my phone. A snack size reuben sandwich took 30 minutes. Outrageous. Everything was slow as molasses and the sever had the laziest hipster attitude I've ever seen. Only finally apologized that \"Kitchen was busy\". There was no more than 10 people in the place and people who showed up 20 minutes after us were getting there food already. First time I was here it was packed and I ordered twice as much food and it came faster. 

Otherwise I like the menu and style of the place. Items are hit or miss."}
{"text":"Wicked little spot hidden away from the corporate bar&grills. The food is spot on with a cozy yet hip atmosphere. The live DJ on a Sunday mid afternoon was a nice touch. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Perfect for a mid afternoon snack and drink.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Well, my first time at 416 Snack Bar was on a date.... when, for the first time ever, I was expected to \"go Dutch.\"  For the memory and milestone alone, I had to remove one star.

Other than that, the place was packed at 7:30 on a Thursday night. I don't know if it was body-heat in the small space but the temperature was jacked. No energy-conservation in this place.  416 was hot, the guy wasn't. (just kidding).  I think our bartender knew it was a little too warm inside since she placed water glasses in front of us and kept them full during our stay.

I love beer. The selection at 416 is small, but decent. I think my two pints (that I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR BECAUSE IT WAS THE DUDE WHO INVITED ME OUT) were $14 (Flying Monkey IPA and Sapporo).  

They've got a pretty decent, well-priced snack menu so it's too bad I wasn't hungry. Spending a significant amount of time, regularly, in the West Indies, I think I'm a pretty good connaisseur of \"doubles,\" a Trini street food. The doubles at 416: good effort, but not even close to the real thing. But who cares, they were $3 which is what they are in the WI. Actually, I love that they were even on the menu as it's so hard to find fresh doubles inside of Mississauga and Scarborough. I'd probably order them again even if only for nostalgic reasons.

Anyway, I liked the place (not the date) and I'm looking forward to returning with friends for drinks. The vibe was good and lively, people were friendly and the staff was efficient and attentive: a trifecta earning 416 4 stars. Oh, and the snack menu options were refreshing.

Worth checking-out with friends for drinks and small bites."}
{"text":"Looking for Snack and dranks? This little hipster bar is a pretty cool spot! Great for a first date or to grab a drink w a friend. It's tapa style, can't really go wrong! I always get the eggplant, cause it's my fav!"}
{"text":"Yay for 416 Snack Bar tapas!!! Came here with a friend around 6pm on a Thursday night so there were plenty of places to sit, however it got much busier as the evening progressed. It was not as loud as some claim, we had no problem having a conversation. The food was awesome, I guess the menu changes all the time. We got to enjoy some lamb skewers, a meat and foie gras board, spicy salmon hand rolls, and the steak tartare which was perfectly prepared (chopped not ground, and light on the seasoning). The dessert was impressive, a home made Jos. Louis, delicious! Love the no cutlery part, and the no modifications to the menu. Very reasonably priced, friendly attentive staff, lively and welcoming environment. Will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Came here unexpectedly and had some great food and drinks.  Ordered Caesar based on what my neighbours looked like, and I wasn't disappointed!mMy friend had the Negroni and it was fantastic (took a sip) bitter and refreshing. 

The snacks we ordered we shared, steak tartare, Ruben and a few others nothing disappointed and everything was delicious. The fact they are utensil free is a unique concept.  Keep in mind the place is cozy, the seating is shared and if you are good with this then you'll enjoy the rotating menu and fantastic bevies!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious - mostly Italian style - food! Expect small plates (I like to order more dishes at the time), no cutlery, good wine and a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't usually get texts the night after an evening of boozing with my friends that say \"That place was sikk [sic] dude!\" But based on our experience at 416 Snack Bar, I can safely say that my mate's exuberance is warranted.

We arrived at TO's newest culinary / boozy hotspot with a fair amount of anxiousness: The lighting was dim, there was barely seating for 20+ bodies and suffice to say, neither myself nor my mates are as sophistimicated as the other hip kids that populate this establishment. However we were lucky to grab a couple seats, then a couple more for friends that were on their way. 

Looking at the menu, I couldn't help but salivate over some of the options. Jamaican Patty? Veggie Tempura? Oysters? Yes! Clearly the dudes that put this place together understand the gastroethnic diversity of this city and they've gone to fairly great lengths to reflect that. 

But having read and heard so much about the steamed pork buns, and being somewhat of a chinese steamed bun junkie, I decided to start my night off with said bun and a pint of Creemore. Upon my first explosively tasty bite of the bun, all misgivings of the place faded away and I experienced a feeling synonymous with my love of this great city. The pork, which was simultaneously sweet and crispy, perfectly complemented the fresh crunchy shredded veggies, all being served in a doughy but finely steamed handheld bun. Wonderful execution.

As the night went on and the booze flowed, conversation with the pretty ladies and dudes around me stayed lively and interesting and the food kept coming. Reasonably fried veggie tempura coupled with a thick and sweet hoisin sauce led to steak tartare and back to pork buns to round out the night.

And with the sounds of funky-soulful vinyl filling the room, friendly, attentive service and a general atmosphere of camaraderie among the bar's denizens, it's safe to say that 416 Snack Bar exudes the culinary fun factor and inventive potential of Toronto nightlife for  25+'ers who live and hangout in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Alright, this is where I go Gordon Ramsey on a place. Prepare to be entertained.

Parking: Side streets, hard to find parking (requires parallel parking). Free after certain hours, otherwise paid.

Washrooms: 

One was out of service (I guess they were too lazy to clean two washrooms, I don't know, maybe it was really out of service). Because the only one that was available was pretty gross, absolutely abysmal.

Well, if you were a guy, it wouldn't be too bad, but I'd feel sorry if you were a lady that had to use it; as there was urine on the seat and what not. The fault may rest on the patrons of the place opposed to the venue owners because aside from that, it wasn't too bad.

Experience/Venue: 

It's like this place couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a night club or a romantically lit place. For starters it was dimly lit with just a single candle on the table. The bad lighting didn't help the hard to read menu's (the font size on their menu was also small), I mean if you come during the afternoon you'd probably have better lighting. 

They had a DJ blasting the music in this place and it was so loud that you would have to yell in order to communicate with your server and because of this, they messed up my friends order. (Well, no kidding! I mean if you can barely hear in the place then 'Spicy Laotian Papaya salad' is going to sound like souvlaki right??) LOL. So, after waiting for so long for her order to come out, it had to get sent back for the actual order to come out.

And as for the size of the place, it is really small. That sums up my experience for going at night. It might be better if you showed up at noon, I don't know. Will the DJ still be there around noon?

Food: 
The food was probably the reason I bumped it to a 2-star. It tasted good. I get that you're a \"Snack Bar\" but avoid this place if you plan on getting full because for the price you are paying here, you will need to bring $200 - $500 in order to get full. The price you pay for 2 snack items on the menu could get you an actual 'main course' at any other place. 

If you're serving snacks, make sure the price matches or at least serve portions equivalent to what you are charging.

(My friends told me I should warn other patrons about that, either bring a lot of money with you or just go somewhere else to eat if you planned on getting full)."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but based on the fact that it was a full house at 11pm on a Monday night I'm sure this place is a local favourite. My friend recommended this place for us to have a couple drinks and snacks. The environment is a little too loud to have a nice conversation but we didn't mind that at all, although I did end up with a sore throat the next day haha. 

The service was mediocre but the tapas were amazing! We had the foie gras crostini and the steak tartare. 

The steak tartare was a flavour explosion & the prices are very reasonable for what you're getting albeit the portions are small but that's what we expected. The tartare had such full flavours from the fresh meat, as well as a smokey steak taste with raw beef texture on a piece of house made bread. You have to try it for yourself. 

The foie gras was amazing as well! It paired so well with the sweet paste. 5/5! 

I would definitely come back to try some other things like the tuna hand roll and basically everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I came to 416 Snack Bar with high expectations, perhaps because I had heard and read a lot about it in advance. The tapas serving style made it the ideal choice as we were in between meals on a lazy Sunday afternoon and wanted to get some finger food. We tried the eggplant sandwich, Korean fried chicken, and the handroll.

Although creative, the execution of the individual flavours was a bit disappointing. The sandwich was crispy and freshly fried but the flavours within it were quite bland. The Korean fried chicken was spicy but also had a very gingery and sweet sauce, which was not at all what I was expecting. Granted, the style here is fusion...but the sauce did not taste Korean at all. The handroll was well made but once again, very bland and not particularly memorable. In spite of the taste, the ingredients all seemed to be fresh -¬†hence the 3 star rating.

Overall, the menu is quite small so if anyone in your party has a food restriction, this may not be the best option. It felt like we only had three items we could order when I went. Additionally, it took a very long time for us to order and then to get our bill at the end, so the service also left me a bit disappointed. Perhaps the food is better depending on the menu rotation, and service depending on time of day... Try it, but don't go bearing high hopes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just drove from Chicago and we decided to come here for our first meal in Toronto. By far this was one of the best tapas place I have ever been too. Their steak tartar was super delicious, the foie gras was to die for( every place we go to foie gras comes with think chewy breads, but they made their bread into chip looking and the texture is as crunchy like a chip)--absolutely love. We also got spicy tuna hand roll and the octopus. Everything was great, definitely will come back soon"}
{"text":"I like the food and atmosphere, but the Asian lady with the tattoos leaves something to be desired in the friendliness category. One star because of her lack of customer service skills."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a bite on a Wednesday evening and were able to get a table fairly quickly. We asked the waitress for recommendations and she was very helpful in suggesting some of the most popular items. The portions were small, but the prices were still reasonable, especially compared to some of the other tapas places these days.

We shared the korean fried chicken (kfc - I think it was coated with some sort of kimchi sauce, which made it a bit spicy and pretty yummy), the special thing for the day (some chickpea fried dough with cauliflower, tomato sauce and kale - thought this was a bit dry and thus was the least favourite dish), and the eggplant sandwich double down. The last item was by far the best - so good we had to order another one. It's essentially deep fried eggplant with sesame as the bread, and mozzarella, tomato, and arugula in the middle (almost like a caprese salad, which I love). I had a glass of rose, which was decent. There was also a decent selection of beers and other bar rail drinks.

It's quite loud in the restaurant so not really a place for a conversation. The food is also served with no cutlery, and some of it could get messy when eating - perhaps not a great idea for a first date :) The location is a bit hidden, on the northeast corner of Queen and Bathurst, but it's worth the search. I would recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Cool bar with good music.....good amount of beers on tap. We were taken here by locals. Would come back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out, as they have a lobster roll and some people had been claiming it was good.

The selection of beers was good, but when I questioned the server why my cream ale had tons of head. He told me it's a cream ale and that's how it pours........ I had ordered that specific cream ale before and gotten nice full pints. My solution was not complaining more, I just didn't order anymore drinks and I haven't been back...

If the food had impressed me, maybe I would have come back.
The korean fried chicken was tasty... but the lobster roll is in one of those generic white dinner rolls my mom buys from the grocery store. And afterwards we were all still hungry so we ended up going to Pizzeria Via Mercanti for second dinner...

The place is tiny, and it gets full and quite loud. It seems like a place for hipsters."}
{"text":"Keep in mind 416 is primarily doing snacks, which means a few is needed if you're looking to fill up. The steak tartar was my personal fav, marrying great with the garlic crostini. 

But what's going on here? Perhaps I didn't get the memo. Looks like the Yelp reviews I read forgot to mention one little detail: at a certain hour, this fine food establishment basically transforms into a club like atmosphere. Nothing wrong with that. Music so loud that you can't hear yourself think and darkness only broken by a few candle sticks, I guess maybe a little warning would have been nice. Nevertheless the food still is top quality and the best you're going to find this late a hour. 

Overall an interesting experience, and a very much respectable tapas snack selection."}
{"text":"Amazing food, not too expensive, great vibe and service. Get the special of the day and double up... Guaranteed awesome."}
{"text":"Interesting menu, nice staff, cool concept.

A menu that is meant to be shared, and edible with no cutlery. We ordered the Dim Sum Stack and the Italian Board. Both were cool and fun to eat. They don't look like a lot but it does get quite filling. The food is on the heavier side. I like the concept of everything here but the food itself simply did not blow my mind.

Service was nice and but the stools were very uncomfortable..by the end of the meal my back was feeling stiff..and I'm in my 20s. So definitely sit on the chairs if you visit (less romantic but comfortable).

Place is small so call ahead!"}
{"text":"Came here around 6pm on a friday. Fairly busy place, but got two seats at the bar. 

Everyone there seemed to be drinking instead of eating; there was only one other table with food. The menu here is very random. Korean fried chicken, eggplant sandwich, cheese boards. Its tapas style so you can try many things, which is something i always like. Food was decent, but not great, so i can now see why most people were drinking rather than eating (or it could just be the time). 

Foie - foie was pretty good. was a great start to the meal
Korean fried chicken - Was okay if it was just chicken. When you say korean fried chicken i expect it to be super crispy. So this definitely did not live up to the name. 
Eggplant sandwich - double down style with the egg plant as the \"bun\". this was pretty tasty and very cheesy. 
Empanadas - these were filled with beef and some egg white. the empanada was flakey and had good texture. the beef seasoning reminded me of ol el paso taco mix. 

Overall food is just okay, but i guess most people come here to drink and snack rather than treating it as a meal?"}
{"text":"This has quickly become my go-to spot to grab some drinks. Good vibe, friendly atmosphere.

Also, if you're hungry, it's a nice alternative to typical pub food!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer from the start and I still love the place. I call it hipster tapas. It's just really good food at a quality you would not expect to pair with the word \"snack.\" The drinks are great, the atmosphere is energetic, the staff are fire."}
{"text":"Have anything, have everything, it's all good and you can't go wrong. It's a tiny little place and it gets full and it gets loud quick with the crazy loud music and everyone on a comfortable buzz.  

I go back once it a while and come back with a full tummy and strained vocal chords.  It's the steak tartare  that keeps me coming back..."}
{"text":"I'm a visiting New Yorker in town for a week on business.  After reading all of the amazing reviews about this place, I was anxiously anticipating my visit to this taps style restaurant.  Upon arriving, my boyfriend and I were greeted by Adrian, one of the two owners.   We ordered drinks - my boyfriend a tall Sapporo, a great value at $8. I ordered the $9 pinot, which while delicious, was a very, very short pour.  Let me stress very short, to the point that I did not order a second one.  

Once seated, we chose 3 items to start; the fried chicken, the steak tartare and the grilled Reuben sandwich.  35 minutes later, no, wait, 40 minutes later, no food. Not even the raw steak tartar.  Nada, nothing, zilch. Even our friendly waitress commented on our unusually long wait.  Ok, so shit happens.  No biggie right?  When she did not return to report on the status of our order which she went to check on, my boyfriend had to get up and find her.  \"They're working on it\" - which everyone who has ever been to a restaurant knows means they simply forgot.  And to make matters even worse, the two people that sat down a full 30 minutes after us GOT THEIR FOOD!!!  

Now here comes the really good part.  I called Adrian over to inform him of the situation, expecting any number of responses from him - \"let me go check on what's going on\", \"let me get you a drink on the house\" or even a simple \"I'm sorry\".  Any of those would have done just fine.  Problem solved. Instead, I got a patronizing, insulting, huffing, over-the-top \"what's wrong with me?\" attitude. 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know it's not an unreasonable request to expect your food to be delivered in a timely manner.   As someone who has dined in restaurants to numerable to mention, and all over the world, I know what casual dining is, and this place it ain't. 

Adrian - if you're reading this - and I hope that you are, YOU NEED A SERIOUS ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT!  GET OVER YOURSELF!  There are way too many good restaurants in Toronto to have to put up with you.  I will not be returning to this place, ever, nor will I recommend it to any of my numerous friends and business associates, who like me, come to Toronto on a regular basis.  Here's an idea - why don't you put a sampling of humble pie on your menu.  That dish would do wonders for you."}
{"text":"Very nice casual snack bar.  It's a tight fit though and at times you might go in and be disappointed because it's a very tiny place.  The service is great and the food is very tiny snack plates.  However, it's quite good.  Prices range from $7+ dollars.  All plates are sharable with another person.  They also have a pretty good drink menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good cocktails, tasty snacks, usually very busy and hard to get in which makes this place not my first choice to pick when I crave the above.
Almost everything is good in the menu"}
{"text":"A nice, intimate wine and snack bar in Toronto. I came here with a group of friends, but this would also be a great place for date night as well. The service was very attentive and friendly and the food was great! I definitely recommend the Korean chicken wings. Our table ended up getting a few orders of it by the end of the night!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and were fortunate enough to get seated very quickly. We worked our way through the menu, and everything was pretty good. The real standouts were definitely the eggplant double down, the more contemporary take on the Rueben sandwich, and the yakitori. The Korean fried chicken was tasty, but was a little like food court general tao chicken, and the pork belly bao was less than impressive. Service was friendly, and anyone that plays through a whole Gucci Mane album gets my vote on ambiance."}
{"text":"We arrived as a party of four on 12/21 for a snack and a few drinks. The place was full, no problem we get on this list to receive a text when a table is open. We were quoted 30 minutes but the wait was closer to 50-1hr. When we finally received a text, while having a drink near by, we quickly made our way there, only to be told they had given our table away in the short 5 minutes. The hostess DID NOT hold our table for the 10 as indicated by the text and did not even seem to want us in the establishment all together. Don't come here if you value your time"}
{"text":"Still as crowded as ever; still hard to get the attention of the busy bartenders but still just as much fun. It's part of its vibe. But the best part now? They have a secret menu. Genius idea! Not sure if I'm allowed to give it away but gat damn, those monster buns are delicious. It's chicken and fish topped with plenty of cilantro and their sauces on bao (that doughy chinese bun). Yum Yum Yum and some more yum. Couple with some Waupaos it's delish. But peeps: make sure you check your bill. They're busy and they may charge you for more than you ordered (honest mistake). And no, 416 is not cheap! 4 beers and two snacks = $45. At least my wallet's thinner this year!"}
{"text":"Price is decent and food is really good. We went around 7pm so there was not too many people. Small portions for each dish so we could order a lot to try almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night (during great patio season weather) for a table of 4 and there was no wait time.

The prices were great, the best part is that tax is included in the price. That being said, this is a snack bar, and the portions are quite small and not intended to substitute dinner (which was what I originally intended to do). 

I ordered the KFC (which was just okay), the steak tartare, and the foie torchan. My favourite was the steak tartare!! I would come back again if I wanted a quick stop for a snack and a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Since joining the ranks of Toronto's population, 416 Snack Bar has, so far, been my favorite dining experience. Living in Little Italy, the establishment was a short jaunt away on a pleasant May evening. 

Arriving to eatery, the first thing I noticed was it was packed and loud, but not so loud that I could not enjoy the wonderful company of my girlfriend. However, if you are arriving as part of a large group, you may have some issues. We just happened to be lucky enough to grab two seats that vacated as we walked in. 

Upon sitting down at the bar, I looked up and saw a rather decent alcohol selection. My girlfriend ordered a riesling while I ordered my standard Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned was excellent and featured 416's very own marinated cherries in rum, cinnamon and another spice that is escaping my mind at the moment. They were excellent, and I asked for two more. 

Ordering food was a bit of a challenge as everything looked great. We started out with oysters. They were accompanied by a vinegar-oyster sauce and dried horse radish. I had to be conscious not to slurp them down too fast and really enjoy the flavors on my palet. 

This was followed by a couple beers and slew of small bites: the special of the day - a sloppy joe, a spicy tuna handroll, steak tartare, something called a pork bun (more to come on that), and a winter salad. The winning dish of the night after the oysters was definitely the pork bun. It was so good, we ordered another. The pork bun was simple. A piece of braised pork in a delicious dim sum--style bun with some greens. Had it not been for my sensible girlfriend, I could have probably eaten a few more. 

I must speak to the quality of service, as it was superb. We were treated well, and they were attentive to our every wish from extra cherries to wifi information. 

Here are my tips and recommendations:
1. The place is small and may not be suitable for very large groups. Perfect for a date or group of up to four. 
2. Take your time. Order a couple things at a time. 
3. I highly recommend the oysters (get 6 -- 3 will not be enough), the steak tartare and the pork bun. 
4. If you like old fashioneds, order one here. Ask for more cherries and savor them."}
{"text":"Had the steak tartar, Cesar salad, steamed pork bun, cardamon ___(?) desert and 2 Rubens between 2 of us. Everything was amazing, and lovely to watch the chefs prep everything. They tasted the product before serving it and would adjust accordingly; showing real love for their craft. The drinks were amazing, and service exceptional. A great mid-high end tapas style bar. Not a meal for an everyday lunch or dinner, definitely more special without being stuff. Real love of food here."}
{"text":"The great thing about this restaurant is that you feel so intimate with the person sitting across from you, even when you have other couples, strangers or friends sitting beside you. I was totally focused in on my date, with the rustic, classy, look of the environment as well... it has real candles. The candle setting reminded me of something that I would see in Beauty and the beast. I loved the artistic interior decor of the restaurant as well. We ordered Smushi, 2 Hand rolls, A Cheese plate Foie Gras and Tartare. They shouldn't of let us order so much at once though- it was AMAZING. The servers we professional and there was more than one serving us at a time. We asked to save a seat for a friend that ultimately did not show up and they politely asked for us to move to the other end of the seating arrangement, which was fine considering for what we were asking. We talked to a couple that was on their first date and they seemed to be having a great time. It is a wonderful place to take your date on for the first time. I could tell that this was the go to place for that, noticing and hearing some conversations. I guess you could say there wasn't much privacy, but for a first date it is great to feel comfortable and not so alone in your environment. The food, was great, I have never tasted anything like what they have on their menu. It was phenomenal and it was delicious. It is a Asian influenced, low-light cuisine. A must and a great place to take the possible love of your life. Here is a pic, of there neon lights inside, vibrant and wonderful. Just like the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night. No problem getting and the doorman was friendly. My friend was already there and he ordered my and old fashioned and man was it well done. Then we had the lobster roll and I can honestly say it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Big pieces of lobster, fresh crispy French roll, and butter that tasted exactly like movie popcorn butter. It was so good we had another. We had the duck Brest too which was awesome as well. Really enjoyed this place, will for sure go back."}
{"text":"I'm always a little skeptical of popular hipster joints.  I also always keep my eyes peeled for fad foods on a menu.  It's usually a good sign that the restaurant is catering toward wannabe foodies. But damn it, I like this place.   The vibe is great, the service was wonderful and the food....just plain good!"}
{"text":"Just had the steamed bun: pork and was blown away! The beer was super cold and never empty!. My food was made and delivered within a respected time and everything was great! The music was awesome too! Overall I had a speculator time and we recommend anyone to come and visit Try the food! Respectable price for everything."}
{"text":"Fun place to stop in for drinks and snacking before a bigger meal elsewhere. Or like us- post dinner snacking to fill up tummies  after eating at a place down the street where you can BLOW a lot of $$ on FISH. (If you didn't catch that, we ate at blowfish on king st and needed more food. )

Fun date night while we reminisced on previous unsuccessful meals at same address: azul's beet ravioli / cantina's horchata. 

Would return as a pit stop for snacking and move on for a full night of queen st snack crawl. There's so much great food in area. Would not depend on it as a destination for a full satisfying meal if you like to eat like me."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night. I came in with my boyfriend and we were immediately seated at the bar. We shared the tartar, reuben sandwich, and korean friend chicken. All three were great but the reuben stood out to me the most, and I'm typically not a fan of reubens. Taylor was behind the bar and did a great job as I lead my boyfriend on a bit of a classic cocktail tasting. Though we had mostly classic cocktails, Taylor made them perfectly each time and wasn't offended when my guy asked for more angostura because he's just weird like that. I was excited when I saw St Germain on their shelf and Taylor obliged when I asked if he could slip a little into a glass of Cava for me. 

The bartender also came over and apologized to us. Someone had sat next to us shortly after we had arrived, ordered food right before we had, and had eaten and paid his bill before our snacks arrived. The bartender was honest and told us he had gotten busy and had forgotten to punch in our food, but that he would ask to have it rushed for us. I work in the front of house and my boyfriend in the back of house, so of course we understood completely. We were in no hurry and it was not an issue at all, and we had our food in a matter of minutes after that. I was really happy that Taylor had been upfront and honest and apologized. They comped the first two plates that we had ordered. I would have been happy paying for them because he was honest about it and we were not upset, but felt taken care of when he informed us as he dropped the bill. 

Also, the live music was top notch. All in all a great evening with funky cocktails and awesome bites, I'll definitely make an effort to head downtown to enjoy this little spot more often."}
{"text":"I've been to 416 twice and the second time was a very good experience.  The first time happened to be on the hottest day of a sweltering Toronto summer.  It was so hot in the restaurant that we had to bail since there was no air conditioning.  Fortunately, a few weeks later, we had a second chance to stop by.  I found the drink prices reasonable and yes, the portions ARE small, but that's the idea... snacks, hence the name.  I enjoyed that if you're making a meal of it, you can try a bunch of different things.  Also, I didn't find sharing an issue as most dishes seemed suited to that.  We went early on a Sunday evening and it was not crowded; perhaps this explains why the server was very attentive because she had the time to focus on us.  She seemed to be around just enough to keep our glasses full, but not enough to be intrusive.  All in all, I look forward to going back.  It's always interesting to enjoy a pint or two while people-watching especially around the Meeting Place; )"}
{"text":"This place gets busy! I went with 2 friends on a weeknight right after work and literally every table was taken (most places in the area were empty).  It looks kind of sketchy from the outside, but once you're in it's very nicely set up.  The table we got was more of a high-table with bar stools, located conveniently right next to the speaker (so any conversation was yelling in each others ears).  

Food was impressive! Small portions as you'd expect but the prices weren't too bad.  Good place to go for a beer and a bite to eat, but i wouldn't go there to linger or on a date, it's just too hard to talk. I'd hesitate going as a large group, you'll have trouble finding seats, but if you went as a group of 4 i'm sure there'd be no trouble. Bar staff were quick to get us our drinks and answer any questions."}
{"text":"Just slightly hipster without being too hipster. I've been twice now and I think I can safely say 416 Snack Bar is a solid 3.5 star for me.

Please don't go here expecting to eat a full meal. The snack portions are very tiny. If you were starving you could likely eat 5-6 \"snacks\".

The snacks are, however, perfect when you just want a small taste of food to pair with your beer or wine. It sort of reminds me of Greek bar/taverna culture (Where you are usually served some kind of small portion of food with a drink, even if it's a dish of 5 olives or a slice of bread with olive oil).

The menu is small. Bottled beer starting from $6 all the way up to $10. Glasses of wine start at $8. Snack are $3-$6 but most cost $5. I feel like they are just *slightly* overpriced for what you get; they are really tiny. My latkes ($5) were literally the size of ritz crackers, and you only get 2. But yes, they are delicious!

Great vibe and seems to be really busy no matter when you go."}
{"text":"Review #400
In late 2011, following a local Yelp event, a few of us followed then Toronto CM Vivek to a new spot that had opened up on the corner of Bathurst and Queen. By that point, about a year had passed since I had swapped NYC from Toronto and everyone who had crossed me was sick of my comparisons between the food scenes in the two cities. Snack Bar quickly became the first spot in Toronto which turned the tables and had me bragging to my friends from New York. Between the passionate staff, slick layout, and crisp old school hip hop playing in the background this place definitely had a personality of its own.  Add to that a display over the bar where the rotating artwork included painting of the Maple Leafs and a panel of old TTC bus transfers and you had a spot that was quintessential Toronto. 

In the years since, the menu has changed countless times, as have the clientele with the emergence of rave reviews in every local outlet. Despite this, the character of the bar and the drive of the staff to deliver something different appears to be well intact. From some of the more consistent menu items I have always enjoyed the steak tartar, steamed buns and oysters. The menu items I wish would return are many and include the scallops ceviche (pair with tequila), devils on horseback, eggplant parm and anything I've tried with quail eggs! 

The drinks are also quite potent and well made. My favs here include the corpse reviver #2, paper plane and gimlet. The options for beer, wine and cider are mostly on point, while they also serve a phenomenal chaser with shots of tequila! Add to all of this the fact that they were very accommodating to a friend's extensive food allergies during a visit and you have a place that's a winner on my list. 

Overall, Snack Bar has managed to remain my favorite place in the city since the first time I stepped in. Their consistency and professionalism deserves praise and should help establish them into a Toronto institution at this rate. Try to visit on an off night and be weary that the space is tiny/ not the best for parties larger than 4."}
{"text":"always awesome
sometimes have trouble finding a seat but always fun and chill
and tasty food"}
{"text":"Things you should know:
- this is not a place to have dinner, it's a hipster bar with dinner-type food in snack portions in placement of bar food.
- ironically, drink selection is very limited.
- each \"tapa\" is individual-sized. 
- as a \"rule\" they dont have cutlery
- small place with no reservations
- seat yourself, don't expect service
- music really loud. 

The conception of this place is interestingly executed. 
\"416 snack bar\" includes snacks from all cultures found within the 416, which includes pork belly bun, latkes, pizza pocket, braised rib sandwich, spanakipita, bahn mi, etc.  .

The food is pretty good overall, though the pizza pocket and spanakipita were really bland. If you decide to make a dinner out of it, don't get expect to get full unless you order at least five items for yourself on the menu. 

A nice place to take a date or happy hour, if you're not expecting service at all. The people who work there can be extremely indifferent and rude to you like they're doing you a favour to open this place."}
{"text":"Interesting menu. Their selection of food is really diverse, ranging from Korean fried chicken to Vietnamese rolls to Mexican fare. We sampled quite a bit of the menu since everything was pretty cheap, about $6. I really liked the \"special thing\" which I'm guessing is their special of the day and that day it was this creamy slaw on a biscuit with some tobiko on top. It was delicious. The foie gras and Portuguese rissois de camarao (cheesy shrimp croquettes) were also pretty tasty, though there was nothing we ordered that wasn't a winner. If you're in the mood for something a little different, try the eggplant sangwich doubledown-- it was this sandwich with a crispy eggplant/sesame bun with mozzarella and tomato. 

The space was small and cozy with dim lighting but it was pretty loud."}
{"text":"Snack-sized foods is always a win for me. It's the dim-sum loving part of me that screams YESSSS to variety, and 416 Snack Bar provides variety at a great price too!

My visit here was wrapping up a 2-part dinner, so the fact that dinner #2 here was devoured should speak volumes of how good the food was! BF and I ordered steak tartare ($7), korean fried  chicken ($5), reuben ($7) and fish steamed bun ($5). Do you see these prices over there?! Fantastic prices - my favourite was the steak tartare, which really hits the carnivore spot in me. The KFC was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Noms.

The unpleasant part is that this place is packed to the brim. BF and I sat at the picnic table in the front, and we were shoulder to shoulder, literally. Everytime I reached forward, I apologized for nudging the dude next to me. However....BF and I ended up chatting with these dudes later on and they were pretty cool!!! So that's an upside! 

Just be prepared to shout your private conversations out loud, otherwise there's no way anyone can hear you over the music!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you are all by yourself and need to go out because you're tired of binge watching Netflix on your laptop and all the dudes on your OkCupid match list have bored your tits off. If you live in this city, they all look like variations of hipster Jesus and they are all somehow \"living life to its fullest.\" They have no time for your drama. Try messaging one of them, they won't message back, I promise. They are too busy handgliding in Thailand to care about your common interest in \"Sons of Anarchy.\" Slap that lap top lid down and start living IRL, bitches. That's my motto these days.

Came here the other day at 5pm, I'm growing out the silvers around my temples so I'm not afraid of the early bird special. Sat down at the bar and had a Creemore and some dumplings and that Korean fried chicken, yum. But! I don't care about food at this point, it was all good and yes, reading the reviews next time I will order the steak tartare. Whatevs. My eyes were darting around the room which was filling up fast. It was a long winter, I am staaaarving. For peen, not fucking tapas, I've eaten enough over the last three months, I'm like a bear waking up from a grilled cheese/Netflix coma.

So this happened: At first I was the only one there, it was a Tuesday, so I was feeling a little weird but by 6 pm the place was packed with who else but the hipster Jesus dudes from the OkC scroll. Then he walked in. I was sitting at the corner of the bar, by this time the sun was setting in such a way that I was blinded and could only see his silhouette. I could tell he had that kind of tinge of ginge brown hair that i melt over and he was wearing a jean jacket, pushing the season like a real man. Honestly if I see another black parka, I will set it on fire. He took a seat at the end of the bar, and we were buffered by an unlikely couple where he was a young hybrid hipster geek with a sleeve tattoo who probably worked for an app developing company and she looked like a MILF-y-type middle-aged real estate agent with newscaster hair. IDK but I like seeing couples like that, it proves that people are out there mashing it up willy-nilly and it gives me faith in humanity. We all need to bone beyond our comfort zone, don't you think?

Anyway, tinge of ginge dude and I lock eyes. And he is hot. I can't look too hard because I get embarrassed easily (I really do) but I pretend to look at my phone like all the urban zombies do these days. He doesn't have phone, which is refreshing. The music is super loud there, btw, so I can't hear what he orders. But his girlfriend (of course) arrives at some point and shimmies herself on the stool beside him. I order a second Creemore and some weird thing I forgot I ordered showed up but I couldn't even tell you what it was but had some potato skin on the bottom? Not sure but I think there was cheese and mushroom in it. Ate it, there was gravy too. It could have been poutine reinvented, genius in theory but meh in taste. But never mind that.

Every single time I looked over at him, he was staring at me. While his super hot model girlfriend nattered away, he seemed completely disinterested in her. I wonder if there is some kind of shift in the universe?  I tried not to stare back because I was palpitating and perspiring and preparing for my graceful exit. After I paid, I went to the washroom (nice, clean) and when I swung the door open, he was standing there. Everything froze, me, the door, him, and what seemed like an entire weekend in a cabin in the mountains (but was only a split second), he grabbed the door i was holding and smiling at me, he put his hand over my hand and I felt an electric charge go through my whole body. Or at least part-way. Yaaasss, bitches, I am fully awake.

So yeah, next time I will try the tartare. My teeth should be sharp soon enough."}
{"text":"Two years since the last Yelp review and I say that this place is a trendy, cozy tapas bar that deserves your attention. Located near the corner of Bathurst and Queen, it's a New York vibe bar that serves 4 star tapas food. 

We tried the spicy tuna roll (a bit too salty if you use the soya sauce), the beef tartar (pretty tasty), the oysters (only OK) and the Korean fried chicken (delicious) and we satisfied with the portions. Drinks were ice cold and service was fast. They have enough staff to feed an army! 

The venue is chill and hip, a bunch of 20's and 30's here. Would highly recommend for the experience. I'd say this place is a hipper, more chill version of Black Hoof. 

We came on a Tuesday evening at 7:30 pm and still got a seat. Recommendations: try the spicy tuna roll but skip the soya sauce. The staff are super nice and quick. The space is good for max groups of 4."}
{"text":"Came here last night after hitting the bars. We arrived around 1pm and it was packed. thankfully a nice couple  at a table made some room and we were able to sit. Ordered 2 beers and proceeded to order almost everythign off their menu. We had 2 doubles, 2 bbq pork buns, fried chicken, pierogies... hmm maybe thats it. Okay not everything off their menu - i exaggerated a bit. Anyhow the food came out quickly and it was awesome. The pierogies were a little on the small side but they were tasty. My faves were the pork buns and doubles. Hence why we ordered 2. This is a cool place to grab some snacks after drinking all night and end your night off right. Its tucked away and has a neighbourhood vibe to it. Will definately be back! Bill was 40.00 too. AWESOME."}
{"text":"I would have given about 4 stars if I didn't get sick from eating at this place.  Most people would not have discovered the potential health hazard if you were not having stuffed nose n had to breath with your mouth in the eve. (Had to be 1,stuffed nose ; 2 evening with candle light) there were about 20 giant candles burning at the same time for hours and hours n t was was the main source of lighting which I liked at first. While other restaurants use small candles these giant candles seemed more fancy. However shortly after staying in the restaurant I started to feel increasingly difficult to breath. I had been having sniffles n cold due to a bad cold but was getting better. I shrugged off thinking colds usually get worse in evenings so might just bad luck. As night go on since the place was loud on Fri evening my nose was blocked , I had to use my mouth to breath n kinda semi shout to my friends. It really increased the irritation of my throat that it had very unpleasant feeling almost as if I chock on smoke n I started to cough constantly. By the end of night as we were leaving close to Mid night I was feeling extremely sick coughing ferociously ,just through my upper body n felt very nauseous and unwell.

Went home n tried to spit out whatever was clocking in my throat-------- BLACK BLACK BLACK SOOT! (Yeah all from staying there for 4.5 hrs)

I FREAKED OUT!!! It looked like I spit black squid ink!!!! For a split second I thought I was dreaming or my eyes were seeing things since I was sick! I trie to compose myself to see what the heck was that stuff n I had never even know a human can spit ink. It was like black tar!!!!!! Then it clicked why I was getting sicker and sicker in the place! The 25 giant candles burinng plus small space and closed door/windows.  Plus all the stuff had built up in the air night after night with that many candles Burning. I am talking about those massive tall candles U see at church in movies. So i was inhaling the toxic smoke that produced 20-30 candles a night n the build up from previous nights. Apparently modern candles are VERY toxic the stuff it released its very similar to Diesiel engine and very cancerous(I am not even a health nut)! 

\"Paraffin is the major ingredient in most conventional candles and is a sludge waste product from the petroleum industry. It releases carcinogenic chemicals when burned. The soot/fumes are similar to that released from a diesel engine and can be as dangerous as second-hand cigarette smoke. This can contribute to serious respiratory issues like asthma.\" -x20 going same time .

Ugh I wish I don't have to do the 1 star . Cuz I liked the place. By coming to the restaurant that night set my health back for a week. I was getting much better from the cold, that entire weekend I coughed so bad like my lung was inflamed ! I d love to come back but only when window open. Even day time no candle lit I know this place has polluted indoor air can makes me scared a bit. Hope they use more actual electric lighting than the giant candles. Most restaurant use mini candles n barely burn much. This place candles r the only source of lighting so they burn thru a lot of those. 

Food was good. I loved the oysters n ribs! :)::) service is good too and waiters r very nice. We gave him a good tip that he well deserved. I didn't t want to write this but I thought health is more of concern than a tummy."}
{"text":"We came in here while on   vacation. Highly recommended by yelpers. I was really looking forward to good Korean fried chicken. Unfortunately I have to say that the Korean chicken at hawkers in Jacksonville Florida is better than any chicken I had there. The grilled peach and haloumi toast was amazing."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday night in the midst of bar hopping around Toronto. After reading some of the reviews below, I kinda wished I tried some of the food. I remember salivating at the smell of the several foods the person directly beside me was ordering. 

As a bar, the ambience is pretty nice. It's a little small, but I think that's the vibe they want. Small and cozy. They also had a DJ playing some pretty good music in the corner. However, the music was a little loud for my liking. I could barely keep a conversation with someone directly across from me without having to yell.

Overall, I really liked the place. It was kinda tough to fit our group of 5 in there, but we had a good time nonetheless.

Based on it being a bar, I'd give it just a three-star rating. But based on the smell of the food alone, I feel like I should bump it up one star. 

Is it weird that I didn't have any snacks at 416 Snack Bar?"}
{"text":"I just don't feel the love at 416 Snack Bar. 

With Zero Services as there were not enough staffs to work the crowd. The place was packed on a Tuesday night! 

Music was really loud and you have to yell at each other to be heard. 

Food was underwhelming and overpriced. 

I have the smallest mini mac ($4) I ever have. I can probably pop the whole thing in my mouth... and it just tasted really bland... McDonald's up the street might have been a better choice. Scallop Cerviche didn't taste much better..... 

Drinks was reasonable priced...but the selections are really limited. 

Not a good place if you come as a big group as 416 is relatively small... 

They accepts Visa and Mastercard with $25 minimum...."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoyed the atmosphere at 416. It was very trendy & relaxed - the perfect place to start the night! We had some drinks and tried the korean fried chicken along with the tofu version. Both were delicious! Would go back to hang around again."}
{"text":"This joint is really small, but great. Go nuts ordering any food on the menu.. I haven't been disappointed. favourite is steak tartar. Only thing that annoys me is if there's a wait. This place can get REALLY busy.

I wouldn't sggest this place for a group function, but I would definitely DEFINITELY recommend for a date or just to go for drinks w one or two others max."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Food is great, not incredible. Good beer selection and small plates + diff types of cuisine in one meal makes it fun"}
{"text":"I have always thought highly of this place but unfortunately this is no longer the case. I came in for a date here and the girl I was with cannot eat any food that contains Gluten. The waitress suggested the Tuna roll on the menu that she said was gluten free. She enjoyed the Tuna roll but felt suspicious after eating it.

The next day the girl I was with had a terrible reaction and felt sick the entire day. It turns out there were tempura bits in the roll (which contain gluten!). The fact that the waitress was very unfriendly and suggested this meal with confidence makes me very angry. I'm sick of places thinking that gluten free food is a choice. For many its a life threatening condition."}
{"text":"Fun little spot off west Queen. Great ambience and yummy share plates - Korean fried chicken and dim sum stack awesome. Gets packed at 5:30 pm. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I was in town for two nights and ended up back here on both. The food is amazing. We had the Dim Sum, Pork Steam Buns, Foie Gras, Spicy Tuna Roll, Tandoori Chicken, and Falafel. Each item was delicious and had an interesting preparation. The drinks were great here as well but best of all was the service. They welcome you in from the front door, seat you immediately and consistently offer great service throughout. We will be back the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Good spot. Really good price for the quality and quantity of food. The wine selections are okay but better spot if you're looking for a snack and some beer."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of San Francisco. Hipster central, almost had to break out my beanie and fake mustache from halloween to fit in!

Good drinks, good people, good hip hop and serious bass. Now unfortunately I only came here for drinks, but the I was by the bar and saw the chefs making sushi and other snacks under lamps beside it. The snacks smelled really good, couldn't get away from the aromas sitting by the bar, but of course I was saving myself for a late night Mucho Burrito!

I was really surprised at how packed this place was for a Wednesday night, no tables available, just a few stools at the bar. Definitely if you're in the area I'd recommend checking this place out on a weeknight after work, love the vibe - bookmarked."}
{"text":"This place is amazing; perfect for a girl's night, intimate date, or to bring out-of-towners. Just make sure you come with a small group! Unless you head in early on a weeknight, you're most likely to wait for a table.

416's concept is simple: no cutlery. Everything is small, shareable and meant to be eaten with your hands. I came with a few girlfriends and shared too many delicious things, the highlights being the Korean Fried Chicken, Steak Tartare (hundreds of Yelpers don't lie) and the Pork Steamed Bun. They also have an awesome cheese board, served with blueberry vanilla jam and candied nuts. Damn, it was so good! As far as drinks, we never strayed from the Manhattans, which I would argue are the best in Toronto. And anywhere else I've been, for that matter.

The vibe here is sexy and fun, the service is great (aside from the doorman, who can sometimes be a frustrating hard-ass about bringing in bags), and the menu doesn't disappoint. Go!"}
{"text":"Yelp led me astray. 

Tiny plates of food? Check. 
Hipsters galore? Check. 
Long wait times? Check. 
Communal table shared with 8 other hipsters? Yes. 

Sure it's a cool vibe, we had one of everything on the menu. Plates ranged from $5-13, and nothing was that good. I have to be honest here. Fois on toast for $13- the fois was the size of a quarter. Quail for two $13- literally two bites for each person. Korean fried chicken- 6 pieces of chicken popcorn. Pork Bun $7 for one small bao- oh did you want to cut it in half to split? Sorry no utensils here. That's ok ill use this toothpick that came with my popcorn chicken, I mean my \"korean friend chicken\". Cheese board - boring. Tartar $9- boring. Reuben - half a sandwich? Yes please. 

I think it's hilarious that there are outlets that  state this is a one $ price place. It adds up and you're not even close to being full by the end. Also budget in the cocktails. It's just not worth it when you have to sit at a crowded table with everyone fighting for precious tabletop real estate. Some people at the table had to eat with a plate in hand. Which isn't really ideal when you're paying $9 for a small plate, right? 


It's crowded and cramped. Dark and loud. Again, the vibe is cool if you're in that mood to yell at your dinner mate. Not the right place if you wanted to get to know someone or have a private conversation. I'm not sure that I would go back but probably not. The menu changes frequently so it's possible that I just didn't get a good selection. There's no cocktail menu but they do classic cocktails the waitress told me.  Service was polite. The disappointing food and experience was lacking for me though."}
{"text":"Attentive and thoughtful staff! Loved the Korean fried chicken and steak tartare."}
{"text":"4.5 I like this place. Can't wait to go again. 
I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, but I've passed by on weekend nights and it appears jam packed!
The atmosphere is relaxed and trendy industrial / wood decor. Small place. There was a long list of drinks but did not have any this time for lunch. I would try this again for evening drinks and snacks. 

So this review is based mostly on the food. 
Tapas like style, No utensils. The dishes that came out were delicious! A mix of flavors that blend well together and textures - Octo Bravas was what was recommended and it did not disappoint - the most tender octopus I have had and flavorful. The mushroom tuna hand roll was yummy as well, Argentinian beef was very tender and the scotch egg benny was tasty (though a bit to rich for me but my bf said it was his fav). The Korean fried chicken was good though for me, it was nothing outstanding. Prices of the tapas was reasonable to higher of course for sharing dishes but also reflect the yum factor."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  Noise level, it is loud fair warning.

The food is DELICIOUS. I could not help myself but order more than I should have, I left full and extremely happy.  I sat at the bar and got to chit-chat with Dorothy who was in charge of one of the stations, she was fantastic and since I was solo visiting Toronto for just a few days it was a nice pleasure to get some insights and her recommendations.

I ordered:

- Foie Torchon - need I say more?  Perfect. Just divine.  For $7 for a nice portion of foie, always, always.

- Empanada - very tastey, served with a mustard-esque sauce which was an interesting choice.  Very filled and the pastry outside perfect. I was impressed.

- Korean Fried Chicken - you must get this, and seems to be a popular choice.  Not the most inventive thing in the world but a perfect nom nom.

- Steam Bun with pork - this was my least favorite but was still really delicious.  Living in Los Angeles I have access to some really good Korean and other Asian-fusion foods so high standards but was still good.  But compared to the rest I ordered it was not my top favorite.

- All-Canadian Cheeseboard - OMG this was perfect, I LOVE cheese and let me just tell you, this cheese board was so well put together and the cheeses (which I cannot recall at the moment) were SO good.  Presented beautifully. 

- Oysters - quite tastey, I love oysters so much and this oyster, not sure the variety it was but it was so fresh and served with just the right condiments to adjust to palate.

I also had a few of their IPAs but they have a full bar too. 

I was highly impressed with everything I had and despite the fact it is a little loud in there, it was popping. I went in on a Tuesday night, I can't imagine how busy it must get on weekends.  And the plus was it was 11pm by the time I wanted dinner so this was one of the few places open nearby where I was and I am SO thrilled I picked this place. I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time and ate the following: vegetarian steamed bun (tasty but didn't rock my world), eggplant double down (Incredible! Never would have ordered this but my vegetarian friend did and wow I'm happy I ate it), and the empanada (not loving it, good dough but the beef didn't have the right balance of spice).  Fun atmosphere though, I'd be happy to go back. They were playing great music!"}
{"text":"The 416 + Bars + Snacks  = One hell of a math equation. Seriously, Pythagorus has nothing on this magical trifecta. 

As the name of the place implies, everything is bite size, even the bar itself. A perfect place to saddle up on a stool with some friends and enjoy a few after work Maker's and gingers and order an array of tiny treats. Why is it that eating a bunch of small snacks makes you feel like you've been better behaved than when you indulge in one large plate? Ah. Who cares. It's working for me.

They often have decent DJs spinning and their servers are much trendier than you or I can ever aspire to be. This doesn't really affect the service or anything about the place, but it has to be remarked upon -- it constantly looks like they're filming a scene in the new Joseph Gordan-Levit flick. 

PEPPER POINTS for their oysters served on a bed of salt. Ever-changing, always fresh pearls."}
{"text":"Nice snacks and a great bar to drink at but the space is tiny. I love chilling at hole in the walls but they need to expand or think of ulterior ways of opening up the patio in the summer because it's really cramped in there (even on a Thursday)! The whole seating situation aside, the portions were a lot smaller than expected. Their dimsum plate was disappointing. The Korean fried chicken was my favorite, and the steak tartare somewhere in the middle."}
{"text":"Such a great Friday date-night at Snack Bar! We tasted so many delicious things, and didn't leave uncomfortably stuffed (I honestly think we ordered half the menu). The concept of no cutlery is also pretty sweet too, because who doesn't love eating with their hands?

As delicious as everything was (the tartar, the cheese, the beer!), I have to say my favorite thing was the Snack-a-Roos - it was like eating an adult version of one my biggest childhood guilty pleasures. LOVED!"}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar never disappoints. This is our go to dinner place. Great snacks, great crowd, amazing staff!
Can't wait till the new 416 opens in ChinaTown.
Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for a friends birthday. Found it really underwhelming TBH. It was really small, but there happened to be just enough seats for us so that worked out well.

I got a cesar which was pretty good and they actually listened to my request of not making it too spicy so that was nice!

There were barely any food options and the people I was with were getting empinadas and korean fried chicken which I wasn't really down for so I got a spicy tuna handroll and the cucumber kani salad. The roll was alright but obviously would  have been better at a sushi restaurant and the salad was weird, it was like in little wraps so I had to eat it with my hands and had this really strong dijon flavoured something in it which was really uncalled for and I did not like at all!!

Will I return? Probably not! But if I did it would be for drinks only!"}
