{"text":"From the minute we walked in, we were greeted warmly and seated quickly. The food was fantastic. The calamari was unique and flavourful, the caprese was fresh and tasty, the homemade sausage was incredible and the cannelloni was delicious.   Service was great as the servers were attentive with prompt refills on drinks and just the right amount of checking in. Of course I would be remiss without mentioning the wonderful and charismatic owner Marco wandering the restaurant ensuring all patrons are extremely satisfied. Thank you for the limoncello!  We will be back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pros: Food did not disappoint; calamari was awesome (not covered in battered and rubbery) and came with a great sauce. Wife had tons of clams in her linguine and my arrabiata was very good. Everything tasted fresh and the portions were pretty generous.   Cons: Felt forgotton the whole night. Waited 10 minutes after we sat down before being offered water. And each course took quite a while to come out. What was most baffling was that the table next to us got all their courses ahead of us, even though we had ordered first by a good 15 minutes. Seating was so tight that everyone kept kicking my chair as they walked by. Not a relaxing and comfortable dining experience. After nearly 2 hours, we got out of there and said \"no thanks\" to dessert.  Would definitely be back if based on the food alone but will have to think twice considering the other factors."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best risotto in Calgary. If it's anywhere on the menu or the specials, order it! This is a family run cozy relaxed resto with great rustic Italian food. The kitchen is run by a mother-daughter duo from Naples and they know what they are doing. Finish your meal with a house made lemoncello, espresso and a tiramusu. Awesome. Be sure to ask for the chili oil to add a little heat to your pasta dishes. There will be no leftovers."}
{"text":"Quant little restaurant. Food was fantastic.  I had the carbonara it was creamy with chunks of bacon! and it is the best I've had in Calgary thus far. Service was good and the owner Marco was very personable coming around to each table and having a chat. Would recommend and already planning on coming back soon to try out other dishes or the 5 course meal."}
{"text":"La Brezza at 990 1st Ave NE in Calgary is a small, casual neighborhood restaurant serving lunch and dinner. It's an indoor restaurant and not noisy. Not fancy, good portions, and good service.  Entrees range $18-25 for pasta dishes and 29-34 for steak or salmon.  Lots of tempting choices  My wife and I had dinner at La Brezza and really enjoyed it. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our service was prompt and friendly.  My wife ordered an Italian chardonnay $10 suggested by the waiter and I had an Italian beer $7.  We split a Caesar salad.  My wife ordered cannelloni and I had the veal parmigiana.  Both entrees came as ordered accompanied by fresh vegetables and were delicious.    Nice presentations, and good portions. Service was very friendly and prompt. Our overall experience was very good. With wine, beer, salad, tax and tip our dinner expense was $115."}
{"text":"Food was great but the atmosphere was terrible.  A very rude and obnoxious woman arrived and dominated the entire restaurant, normally I understand this is a patroon and it is what it is and when you complain you hope the manager would politely ask the person to be more respectful, but the owner clearly knew her- and encouraged her loudness even well noticing we were upset.  Both the servers apologized to us and the one behind us- but that was as far as it went.  It was a lovely meal but when you have to ask your dinner guest to repeat what they said 3 times- that's simply ridiculous.   Too bad, we were really excited to finally get to the restaurant and it was for a special occasion - but the owners clear concern for her friends trumped our few hundred dollar bill."}
{"text":"I love Italian food. I could survive on only pasta and be a very happy girl. I had heard nothing but good things about La Brezza, so thought I would try it out. I had the Fettucine Carbonara, and it was unreal. It was nice and creamy, and had generous amounts of pancetta and bacon in it. My friend had the Fettucine a la Brezza, and loved it. I loved the casual feel to the place, almost like you were in your own home. Of course that's fitting because it used to be a house! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here tonight. The Goods - - Large portions, Calamari was amazing , great Lasagna. The Bads - - Service was not friendly at all, I also could here the entire conversation between our server and owner ( very un-professional I feel ) They were whining about how people that had reservations had not shown up. When we left we didn't even get a \" thank you \". For a small Italian restaurant, I thought they would be more friendlier. With some many other options in the City, We won't be back."}
{"text":"La Brezza is the closest restaurant to where I live in Bridgeland. In fact, it is so close, I could sleep walk to the place, thinking that the bungalow is still part of the old Red Light District of the past.    The restaurant is in an old converted bungalow whose windows are prominently lit with LED's. Personally I find the space small, cramped and tight. I guess if you're in a romantic mood, with the candles lit and smoking, you could describe it as intimate and inviting. If this was Nice or Cannes, I would agree. But it's not. So let's get a grip on reality here.   This restaurant is in the heart of Little Italy and the Italian competition up and down 1st Avenue is stiff. The only thing missing on the Avenue are the touts loudly encouraging you to enter their versions of Roman culinery splendour.   But I digress. The ambience at night (I have not had the plesure of sampling their daily atmosphere) is acceptable and pleasant. After many years in Calgary, they have weathered the storms and energy peaks, and continue to attract a hardcore group of ardent and loyal customers who relentlessly return for more pasta. Season after Season. Obviously they are addicted to the large, heavy, generous and to be fair, zesty servings, offered by the Owner, who like his neighbour on the next block, personally and regally, (somewhat authoritarian?) intervenes in the affairs of the restaurant.   Food generally well prepared, very tasty, attentive and pleasant service, and a so-so wine list. My difficulty therefore, as I have the choices that I have, is whether I walk to the nearest restaurant, the lazy option,or whether I walk a block or two, past  La Brezza and go to an equal or better choice. Tough decision, but usually I walk past this restaurant!  of course, In the interest of my health.   If you havent eaten there however, and you like variety, and an out of africa italian colonial experience, try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Italian meal i've been searching for! I seriously couldn't stop eating as i didn't want to waste one morsel! The brushetta was tasty, the calamari PERFECT, the Vitello perfectly cooked and so delicious. The restaurant was still quite busy even though our party came close to closing time...but were we turned away...NO! You truly feel welcome and comfortable in this quaint place. The service was great and the chef even checked on us. Filomena the owner (had to google the spelling...and found a picture of her and her late husband with ROD STEWART!!...YES...ROD!!!!) anyway, Filomena is absolutely charming and lovely. You can feel she truly cares about those who dine in her establishment. Just a perfect evening all in all!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little treasure I discovered! The owner of the restaurant makes a point of going around all tables & making sure everyone is having a wonderful meal! The food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Tonight this place took gold in Italian food for me!  I went there with my staff members for our staff meeting. Couldn't have left without grinning from ear to ear.   The food, the ambience, and the staff were over the top amazing.   I was in a borderline food coma by the time dessert came.   When you get your menu try not to take too much time deciding. It all sounds so great that you could get lost choosing your items for hours!  Their wine selection is spectacular as well, and don't even get me started on their Creme Brule!   A Calgary Must!  I will return!"}
{"text":"Try the calamari best I have ever had, the spaghetti carbonara was very disappointing"}
{"text":"Oh yes!  Jamaican owned ITALIAN restaurant.  The food is to die for!  The service is good.  The wines available are very good.  Rservations are a good idea as it's very popular even in the week.  Does use OpenTable app and responds promptly.  Just a great place.  Oh and the lamb..... and the New York steak.  Mmmmmmmmmm......."}
{"text":"Was expecting big things from this little place in our new neighbourhood... We made a late reservation for 2 people, same date and that may have been why they fit us stuffed into a little corner beside a party for 7 people. The service was as good as could be for a packed house. Glad we went but I give it maybe a 7 out of 10. We had the escargot to start. Very tomato-ey and a bit sweet but good, cheese was sparse on top but fine. Focaccia bread fresh, but not my fave. For mains, my fiance had the chicken and jumbo shrimp with scallops. He liked it a lot. The chicken was tender, pasta (penne) was cooked to perfection as were the scallops. The shrimp was large, meaty and juicy. I liked the sauce accompanying the pasta as it was a bit spicier. The sauce in my seafood lover's pasta was back to the sweet again. I am so happy I carry my own cayenne pepper! Saved the day! Some of the clams in my dish were not open all the way and a bit gritty but overall the seafood overloaded the pasta and that is always a good thing! I like my food served hot and it was! We were sorry we had to skip dessert (maybe next time as I think we would go back) but the cappuccino was great but $4.50 for a very small cup. Oh and the wine - the house wine, both red and white are nice, $9 a glass. A glass of Pinot to switch it up a bit was $13.75! What? Oh well, we paid our somewhat overpriced bill and at about $130, voila you have 2 people fed from La Brezza with leftovers. A nice enough evening although it would have been more enjoyable in the dining area out front - we will make reservations more in advance next time. Thanks to Marco who came to our table and made us feel welcome and was very complimentary. Also thanks to the waitress that saw me dying of heatstroke in there and turned the A/C on! Cheers!"}
{"text":"A great stop for lunch, a restaurant I had never really considered for anything other than supper before; and since my friend and I have been going for lunch I figured we might as well give it a try!  While I know from experience a reservation is often necessary to get a table with no wait at supper time, I was shocked to find only a handful of tables at lunch. I ordered their Pollo Parmigiana, as I have never had it before and loved every bite of it. It was as rich as it should be, with a fine layer of breading; something often overdone at most restaurants! The chicken was delightfully moist, as were the vegetables that it came with.  As usual Marco was found wandering around checking in to ensure that the service was fantastic; he made an extended stop at our table, discussing what had brought me by for lunch when he has only ever seen me at dinner (I found it  astounding that he would even recognize that I had been there before, given I am certainly no regular). He also offered us chilled limoncello, which they made from scratch, positively magnificent - frozen shot glasses to keep it ice cold, it did not hit the palate as strong as you might expect, the cold subdued the alcohol and allowed you to taste the exquisite sweet lemon taste that is often masked by the alcohol.  All in all, a magnificent experience, as usual!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food! The appetizer calamari and the bruschetta are amazing. Homemade pasta also excellent, sad that Marco Abdi is no longer with us, however the food is the same and the atmosphere cozy and friendly, great place for am intimate anniversary meal."}
{"text":"Came to LA Brezza with several others for a work / team dinner.  All six of us agreed that the food here was just ok, and that the service was poor.  Considering that this restaurant was ranked #1 on Trip Adviser for all restaurants in Calgary, it was a big disappointment.   Speaking for myself, I had the Caesar salad and the veal saltimboca.  The Caesar was ok, but nothing special.  I highly doubt the croutons were made in house (likely from a box). The dressing had a lot of garlic (ok for me but maybe not for others).  The saltimboca was REALLY salty and overpowered the dish.  This coming from somebody who rarely says that about food.  The side pasta that came with the dish (penne with a marinara sauce) was uninspiring, mediocre, and very plain.  FYI - portions are pretty good size overall.  I would recommend DaGuido or La Casa d'Italia over La Brezza for Italian in Calgary.  For the same money you'll get a better meal and better service too. My colleagues and I do not plan on revisiting La Brezza."}
{"text":"My favourite traditional Italian food is found here; in this sweet home where everyone is taken care of like family.   Pastas are all phenomenal especially the carbonara. Three of us shared three types of pasta and could not choose a favourite. Finish with Tiramisu and coffee and be a happy human again.   You can taste Nonna's love in all of the food."}
{"text":"Feels like home, tastes like home, and heck, it even looks like home!    In fact, before it became this delicious, feels-like-family, Italian restaurant, this old Bridgeland Bungalow was in fact  the owner, Marco's home. How do I know this? Well, after a meal at La Brezza I was sharing good conversation with what felt like old friends, not restaurant staff.  Once seated in the small and intimate dining room, we were greeted by a  friendly man with one heck of a genuine smile who shook my hand earnestly and said \"welcome home.\" That's exactly how I felt. All of a sudden I was eating a delicious home cooked meal with the Somalian Italian family I never had.  While I wolfed down some of the best freakin' calamari* of my life, I watched him buzzing attentively among the other tables making sure everyone was included, having a great time and treated like family. At a restaurant like La Brezza, you want attentive service mixed in with good amounts of private time. The line between too much and too little can be tightrope thin but the staff and owner walk it effortlessly.  *Back to that calamari! Where do I even begin? Seriously, I don't even know how to do this... Hey, foodies! Please go eat the La Brezza Calamari and write me a description because I am beyond words. I loved it.  As I was putting on my coat and exclaiming to one of the servers what a great experience I had, she said \"With Marco, it's more like dinner AND a show.\" I couldn't agree more. What a great show it is."}
{"text":"The boys and I were craving Italian food last Thursday, so we decided to drop in (without making dinner reservations like we usually do).  Luckily, there were several tables available and we ended up sitting in a cozy corner by the front window of this converted bungalow.  Our server was extremely pleasant and attentive throughout the entire evening.  Halfway through our meal, the owner, Filomena, came over to our table and greeted us warmly.  She also visited with the other customers and made everyone feel welcome. Calamari Brezza: lightly floured (not breaded) and lightly fried with a mildly spiced tomato and fresh basil sauce.  This was the best calamari I've ever eaten; it melted in your mouth like butter!  Red snapper, mussels with a side of penne and vegetables: the snapper was perfectly cooked and meltingly tender.  The asparagus, carrots, and red peppers acted as a wonderful complement to the snapper; as did the penne (which was just al dente and lightly tossed in a tomato sauce).   Steak special: my hubby had the filet mignon, grilled prawns with a side of penne and button mushrooms.  The kitchen was a bit overzealous with his filet and it was medium well instead of medium rare.  However, the steak was still juicy and flavourful.  Fettuccine Carbonara: our son liked this so much that he almost didn't want to share with us.  The fettuccine sauce was as smooth as silk and super creamy (without being too heavy).  Combined with the smoky bacon/pancetta and bruschetta (he won't eat fresh tomatoes but he loved these), he thought this was a truly awesome dish! We even had room for dessert... Crêpes alla Brezza: vanilla ice cream wrapped in crêpes with orange glaze.  It was wonderfully refreshing and the glaze was not too sweet. Tiramisu: ladyfingers with espresso with mascarpone cream filling and chocolate dust. Mmmmm...   They've won me over with this dessert, even though I'm not a big coffee fan. We had an amazing evening and will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurants are the ones that make me feel l had a home cooked meal. Made with love, care, passion and history. That describes the food and atmosphere at La Brezza. We were greeted as we opened the door  with a warm introduction by Marco the Manager. He described the restaurants' highlights after finding out it was our first visit. We were given a cute window table with enough space to have a conversation. Brad, our very attentive waiter, helped us work through the menu and meal specials with confidence and energy. His recommended selection of the Italian red wine was perfect for our chosen dinner selections. We started by sharing a Caprese Salad that was good but could have used more basil leaves we thought.  I had an excellent cioppino (seafood stew/soup) which was one of the specials. The tomato sauce was delicious and there was an ample amount of seafood. Glad I got some before it sold out which Brad warned me about. The stew came with some bread to sop up the last drops from my bowl and some spaghetti with roasted garlic/olive oil and parmigiana. They both were excellent. My wife had fettucine carbonara and said that it was one of the best that she has eaten. Brad mentioned that you could get an add on to the dinner like chicken or other upon request. I also had a taste and really enjoyed it. We are going back for more of this.  The desserts sounded interesting and yummy but we just didn't have room! Thank you Filomena (the owner), the chefs and especially Mama Angela who has been preparing  and guiding the prep for all the recipes and sauces for La Brezza."}
{"text":"I had the pasta with clams which i have had at more than 50 Italian restaurants. This was definitely one of the better experiences, sauce and clams were fresh and pasta tasted homemade.  The shrimp dinner was also great (and we are picky with our shrimp).  The only downside was that we prefer our past al dente and it was a bit soft for us.  Great experience and very casual dining."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Food was fantastic and the service was even better! Very personable and friendly which is about as Italian as it gets."}
{"text":"Their calamari: no breading, melt-in-your-mouth, balsamic reduction lick-your-plate awesome. I tried the featured filet mignon with grilled prawns, vegetables, and button mushrooms; the meat was slightly more done than I would've liked, but the dish as a whole was delicious. Their tiramisu oozed espresso goodness onto real mascarpone. My second visit, looking forward to more!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner last month. We were the only table in the restaurant until about 7pm. The food was great, however the prices were a little much. The only reason I say that (I have no problem paying for quality) is the atmosphere was quite outdated. Felt very much like a 90s restaurant but not in a good way. Met the owner and she was delightful. Had the feature dinner made by the owners mother and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great spot to catch dinner without reservations and also have the intimate romantic dinner feeling. The space is small, it's formally a house and hard to miss. It comes with a small lot for parking off to the side, but street parking is easily found.  On the few occasions I've been here the service has been great. Marco the owner is usually found cycling through the tables, checking in on the food and chatting up the regulars.   The menu is not too big and everything I've tried so far has been mouth watering flavorful. Special notes to the warm house bread, brushetta, lasagna bolgonese, and anything with their rose sauce. They carry only a handful of wines to select from which isn't so bad either. My only offputting experience was a one time experience when the food was over salted, but that was quickly resolved. Overall great experience and becoming a regular place to dine after work."}
{"text":"So simply good!   No details other than quality food, service and consistent flavours.  I love it."}
{"text":"A friend selected this restaurant - rated #2 on trip advisor, yet only 3.5 stars on Yelp - go figure.  I had a very good meal of chicken saltinbocca. Everyone was pleased with their meal. The chef is Somali which surprised my friends.  Having lived in Kenya a year or so, I was aware that Somalia was an Italian colony. Makes perfect sense.  Cozy, good service, and very good food. Recommended."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for her 12th Birthday.  My son said the Lasagna was the best he has ever had and finished everything on his plate.  My daughter said the Fettuccine Alfredo was to die for and I had Mama's Manicotti, which was heavenly!  The service was amazing and Antonio presented my daughter with a piece of Tiramisu with a candle on it and sang her happy birthday.   What a treat to have such exceptional service and amazing food.  We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and my daughter has already asked to go back again soon!  Thanks so much for making my daughter's birthday lunch a memorable one!"}
{"text":"Now! A bridgeland eatery that has good food!   Yes you are paying for it but it's really good!  The service is off the hook and their chef gets it. I had a Caesar salad - yum! And a spaghetti Bolognese , I know pretty boring but it's my fav and it did not disappoint!  Also the sever recommended a Caesar, the drink with whiskey, wozet, it was awesome!  Try it sometime.   This is a definite pass!"}
{"text":"Very good wine suggestions!!...the service was also great and the food was really good.. Maybe the location is not the best... But I really enjoyed this place!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. After reading reviews, I was optimistic. Our server was inattentive. The food was mediocre. Go to La Vita E Bella. So much better."}
