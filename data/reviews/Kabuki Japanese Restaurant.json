{"text":"Love this sushi spot, I've been coming here for the past few years.  They're in Town Square across the street from H&M, next to Yogurtland.  Atmosphere is warm and trendy and is why I often prefer Kabuki to other places in the area.  Comfy private booths, tables, sushi bar, and an outdoor patio.  Usually crowded from happy hour (great specials) to closing, but I've never had to wait more than 10-15 mins.  Extensive cocktail menu, decent wine selection and several flavored non-alcoholic drinks including sweet mango iced tea and mint lemonade.  Edamame comes with all sushi orders.  Good miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing, decent seaweed salad but not my fav.  Lots of apps, including fried eggplant and calamari.  Large selection of specialty sushi rolls, fav is the Lotus on Fire roll (spicy tuna, jalapeno and lotus root on california rolls).  Extensive menu with lots of pictures, and lots of non-sushi items including teriyaki, noodle dishes, soups, seafood, etc.  Fresh fish, great service & atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant.  We had a party of 9 and we waited at least 30 minutes from the time we ordered until our dishes arrived.  And that wasn't even the worst of it.  When we tried to tell the busboy, waitress, and manager, they all adopted a \"not my problem\" attitude.  First we ordered water.  The waitress brought a tray of water and just left it on a nearby table.  This is in Las Vegas, where people tend to get thirsty after a long, hot day.  After a few minutes we were about to get up and serve ourselves when another server finally put the water on our table.  Then there was the long waiting period from the moment we ordered until our food arrived.  It took so long that we started to check our watches, so I know that it took at least 30 minutes until the last person got served.  The first person was served in 15 minutes.  Then, one by one, the dishes slowly came to our table.  The first person actually finished her dinner before the last person was served.  I was the second-to-last person to be served.  The last person was a 13 year-old boy.  I decided to wait until he got his plate, and it's a good thing I did because our waitress then came by, grabbed my dish, and said, \"You got the wrong dinner,\" before hurrying off with it.  There was no apology.  No \"Sorry for the mix-up\".  She just grabbed it and left.  That means someone else in the restaurant also got their dish late, and might've gotten a dinner that was partially eaten.  The waitress didn't even check.  Ten minutes later, my dish arrived, so I ended up being the last to be served.  When we tried to tell a busboy about the long wait, he simply said, \"There are a lot of dishes\" -- as if it's not his problem, and that there's no one he can mention this to.  When we tried to tell our waitress how long our wait was, and how bad the service was, once again, she didn't apologize and didn't even offer any explanations.  We asked for the manager and she simply shrugged and brought him over.  I told the manager how long we'd been waiting and he adopted a very defensive attitude.  When I asked him who his manager, or the owner of the restaurant was, he simply said that the restaurant was owned by a corporation and that I should contact \"Vivian\" (whomever that might be).  In other words, he not only wouldn't acknowledge the problem, he wouldn't take responsibility for it, nor give us an easy way to inform anyone else.  It took three discussions with the manager before he finally let go of his ego, apologized, and offered to look into the problem.  To his credit, he also took my dish off the bill.  But the cost of the meal isn't important.  The problem is with the ineptitude of the staff, and the attitude of the waitress, busboy and manager.  The final insult was that the bill came with an automatic 18% gratuity.  That's because we had a party of nine.  So the staff gave themselves an 18% tip for giving us bad service.  When the tip is automatically included, that takes away your ability to vote.  Before you come to this restaurant, imagine that you'll wait a long time for your dinner, get a lousy attitude, and that you might still have to tip them as if you got great service.  Then think of all the other restaurants in Las Vegas that you can give your money to and go there instead."}
{"text":"Came here for my 6 year old's birthday with the extended family; it was a busy night for them, and I felt quite bad for the wait staff. In the beginning part of the meal, they did a pretty good job with the service and the food was actually 4 star (tuna poke was a particular standout).  Then things got progressively uglier. Despite the restaurant slowing down, our waiter pretty much disappeared. Whenever he would come by, we asked him to bring out my daughter's birthday cake with candles that we had brought to celebrate. He told us at least twice that it was on its way...then 30 minutes went by. Both my kids are melting down, my 6 year old is crying on her birthday, the grandparents are falling asleep and I couldn't even find the waiter.  He finally reappeared and I asked him for the cake back and the check cause we had to go. Another 10 minutes and the cake and the check appear...with a mandatory 18% gratuity added on.  No apologies from the waiter, just our own cake back, a sad little girl, and a pretty much ruined evening.  So we walk out, then I realize that they didn't give us our candles back and we still needed to light them at home!   Final straw, daddy really mad now. Marched back in and spoke to the manager who was very accommodating, removed the tip and found my candles (likely fished out of the garbage).   The moral: great food, they try hard, they just happened to wreck a particular little girl's birthday dinner (for what that's worth).  Luckily, we washed the candles and had a great time at home!"}
{"text":"Loved the shisito peppers appetizer ?never had it before- mostly sweet pepper lightly charred).  Portions are generous, ordered the seafood hibachi, hit the spot with brown rice."}
{"text":"We ordered the garlic teriyaki salmon poke lunch bowl and a philly roll, and they were both made really well! Complimentary miso soup and edamame were good too. Fast & friendly service for a Monday afternoon."}
{"text":"9/06/15 party of 5 This is the biggest let down in this town when it comes to a menu. The food is tasteless. Anyone who eats Japanese food would be totally discussed with this chefs idea of Japanese. Cucumber salad terrible. Tempera is totally tasteless. This chef hasn't a clue what Japanese food is or what's it's supposed to taste like. I am embarrassed that the public likes and more especially tourist are fooled into believing this is KABUKI. Everything we tried was completely tasteless and a terrible presentation. Service staff was inattentive, and to worried about selling specials. Did not listen to what we wanted only what he wanted to upswell."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to randomly go to. No matter what day or time of the week it is, we are always welcomed with great customer service and delicious food. We started going just alone on weekdays as a couple to meet up for dates, then on weekends to enjoy with friends, now we go as a family with our kids ,,, AND WE ALWAYS enjoy our time there. Highly recommend this place!! Two thumbs up kinda place!"}
{"text":"Before, I get started, I should mention that I really think they deserve 3 stars...but they got lucky I walked in during happy hour so they got an extra star for their happy hour menu. Mmkay let's get started.  I was craving some warm udon soup but it was already 9 at night so I wasn't sure where to find some.  Somehow I remembered Kabuki from the Marketplace so the bf and I gave them a call. Lucky me, even on a Wednesday night, they were closing at 1030, whoo hoo.  We were happy to find out reverse hh was going on, they have this deal: buy one, get the second for $1. Genius.  I ordered Tempura udon, we also ordered some appetizers off the hh menu, we got gyoza and sesame chicken.  The bf ordered two rolls :pyramid roll and the kabuki roll. We also had salmon and tuna sushi.  Udon: It was really good, I mean I was craving it so it hit the spot.  I thought the portion looked kind of small but I was stuffed.  They also had a nice variety of tempura yum.  The Rolls:  Honestly..I would pass.  The rolls all sounded amazing but nothing really wowed me.  I would definitely choose the pyramid roll over the kabuki roll but if I was there for hh, I would actually pick a simpler roll off the hh menu and be perfectly satisfied.  The sushi: I did not have any of this but the bf this mention the salmon was extremely fresh.  He did not say anything about the tuna, which means it was just meh  The appetizers: YUM. Money  well spent really.  the portions were a lot bigger than any Japanese restaurant I've been  and they were on hh!!!!  Now, like I said I don;t think I would actually come for sushi but other Japanese foods. And try and make it out for hh!"}
{"text":"First of all I have to say that I love Kabuki - the Town Square location anyway. Kabuki always has had a great atmosphere and design in their restaurants and the food is definetly good. I usually try to make a trip out to eat at Kabuki at least once a month. The kids were visiting for summer vacation and we just came from watching a movie at the Suncoast when I suggested we try out the location at Tivoli Village since we always enjoy our experience at Town Square. That was a mistake! We came during the week in the afternoon and the surrounding area was like a ghost town, like I was waiting for a horde of zombies to come running around the corner at any moment. Anyway, we got to the restaurant and it was just as nice as the other location. Besides the decor and the food thats where the comparisons ended.  Although a lot less busy, there was no one to greet us at the front. We waited for a good 5-10 mins before someone in the back finally noticed and came to greet us, even though there was a bartender and servers that saw us and never mentioned to anyone that we were standing there. We were sat right away.  I proceed to order my usual delicious appetizer, the Firecraker, and I decided to go with something else besides my usual Samurai combo, so I went with some ramen, which was good nothing I would order again. The main entrees came out in a resonable amount of time and everything was prepared great as it always is, however they never brought out the appetizer. I asked the guy who brought out our food about it and he said it was coming right up. It finally showed up when we were halfway done with our entrees and when our server finally came around to check on us I mentioned it to her and she apologized but after that she never returned to check on us. The least they could have done would have been to give the kids a free refill of their \"special\" soda for the minor inconvenience, but that would have been a long shot since no one ever even refilled our regular drinks.   Overall not a good experience, customer service and attentiveness was just not there. Not sure what was going on that day but I felt like there should have been the owner hidden away in another room watching their staff on hidden cameras like that show on tv so they could see what kind of bad service their employees were providing that day. I will never visit this location again. In fact we went to the Town Square location a few days later and received the same excellent food and service I have come to expect from Kabuki!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is the best! I love the chicken udon,and the miso soup, and the shrimp tempura,and the apple cinnamon spingroll.The waiters are very friendly,and the washrooms are the extremely clean.I've been here at least 60 times.The sushi is great,especially the spider roll."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and the flavors of Kabuki. Even the house salad was great. Ive been back multiple times and it's even delicious to-go but I'd be cautious about the wait for pick up. Not so great experience twice now with ordering and picking up. Once the order was just wrong so I had to wait for it to be corrected. Could've been an honest mistake or something on my part. Second time I waited twice as long because the hostess allowed me to order from the wrong menu, then didn't realize she put the order in wrong. Half my order was complete but sat while I had to fix the items ordered off the menu she had no clue was expired by the time I Id arrived. By this time I'm starving but I was invested so I waited patiently but I was hot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places to order from at work. GrubHub driver was pretty quick. Haven't used eat24 drivers but I'm happy with what I'm familiar with so far."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and can only rate it as OK. The service has always been good and the food on the mediocre side. The best I have had are the noodle dishes but if you are a sushi fan you will be let down. Sure, if you are looking to do some serious drinking and need some sushi to chase your saki then this is a fun place. But for serious sushi others in the valley are going to be worth the drive. Read Roka Akor."}
{"text":"I Always go to kabukis in Glendale but decides to give this place a try since I was in  the area  well Aaron was awesome.. really enjoyed his service.. great place to eat"}
{"text":"Best service! great food, happy environment! Paige the bartender is sweet and accommodating! You must come enjoy kabuki!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!  My friends and I (party of 6) arrived at 7:00 and were told it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait.  At 7:50 we were finally seated.    Next, my friends ordered sushi and I ordered a chicken salad. Big mistake.  All of the sushi came out at different times, and finally at 8:25 I asked where my salad was. 8:35 the server comes back and says they accidentally cooked it with dark meat and asked if I still wanted it with white meat, to which I replied yes, I wanted it with white meat. (My friends were done eating at that point.) He then unapologetically stated that will be another 10-15 minutes.    8:50 he brings out the salad and I ask for a fork. 8:55 he comes back with cheater chopsticks and tells me they are all out of forks.  I mean REALLY?!?  Long story short, my friend stood up for me and told them to comp my salad, which they did, but the manager never came out to apologize.    And no, I did not eat my salad with chopsticks; I took it home to eat instead.  Good food.  It's a shame they have such lousy service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i went here three times in two weeks and were never disappointed.  The service was great and the sushi is well priced and excellent.  Their baja roll is amazing and the ambiance reminds me of a vegas style restaurant.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good sushi at a good price.  Will definitely be back there."}
{"text":"With a menu that starts with multiple pages of alcoholic beverages, I'm going to guess this is more of a happy hour type of place.  Unfortunately for us, we came here for dinner.  I thought the Garlic Edamame sounded good, but found it to be greasy, soggy and mostly inedible.  The gyoza, sushi and beef teriyaki were all fine but after my disappointment with the edamame, I can't seem to give this place better than a \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Try the Kabuki roll, its worth the trip in itself!"}
{"text":"First time here & I am impressed with the food presentation & most importantly--it's quality. Their lunch menu & happy hour are affordable. Place can be crowded especially on the weekends. I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Good price! It was my first time trying japonese food, and I absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, been coming here for about 5 years now. But lately their customer service has been disappointing. My last visit the wait to get seated wasn't long considering it was happy hour. But it took us about 45 minutes to order. We felt forgotten considering we decided to sit in the patio, so I went to the front to ask for a waiter, the receptionist said she'd get us someone. We wait 10 more minutes, this time I send my sister to ask for a waiter, again, we wait. I felt stupid going back inside so I called them from my phone & the girl who answered gave me the nastiest attitude. Promised again, they'd send someone until I finally had to ask a waiter that was serving the next table if he can please take our order. He said he would & was actually nice. I think I was more frustrated because I was starving & we had my 1 1/2 year old niece with us. She was starting to get out of control lol. They're usually really great but this time I felt like my business didn't matter which makes me sad because I love their sushi. Will I come back again? No, they've disappointed me too many times. :("}
{"text":"This place is really really overpriced. Their food is just ok and their portions are tiny. The reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because I adore this one sushi roll they do. It's wrapped in thin slices of cucumber instead of seaweed and really good. Unfortunately, for about $10 you get 6 tiny pieces and it's barely enough to fill me up. Also, the servers were very friendly and always ready to refill the water."}
{"text":"The regular food at this restaurant is fantastic but their sushi is inedible. I've tried different rolls at different times. It's just not good. Calamari is excellent though and the service is always good."}
{"text":"So hubby and I love sushi, and we decided to try this spot because we live very close to Town Square and one day while shopping there I noticed that after 9PM all of their sushi goes to happy hour.  I came back later that night with hubby and we gave it a shot.  All I can say is I'm glad that we didn't pay full price or I would have been pissed.  The \"happy hour\" sushi and rolls seemed old, like they were trying to get rid of them before they went bad, and EVERYTHING was loaded with green onions on the top.  I like onion, but not on top of my sushi.  Take my advice, if you want good sushi, find a hole in the wall joint, not this fancy looking spot just because of their stellar location."}
{"text":"I've tried several sushi establishments since moving to Arizona back in May 2014. There was a perfect place up in Washington that we absolutely love and it's set the bar pretty high.  Kabuki is fantastic, especially in comparison to other places I've been to. They put their own spin on sushi rolls and the flavors compliment each other. Their portion sizes are just right. Our waiter was courteous and our service was quick. We went for happy hour, so we got three rolls, some hibachi rice and tempura for $25.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is thanks to our favorite sushi place in Washington. It doesn't quite meet those expectations :)"}
{"text":"Three stars for kabuki.   Food: 5 stars- Excellent rolls , and i must recommend the sunkist roll's , which are specialty rolls. They are California rolls with raw tuna over the top and some sort of delicious sauce. Also, the Philly rolls are amazing. They also give you edamame beans, which are tasty !   Price: 4  stars - So, in comparison to likes of Ra sushi, Kabuki's price's are amazing. Regular rolls are 4-6 dollars for 6-8 rolls and around 9 dollars for 6 specialty rolls.   Atmosphere: 4 stars- The restaurant is decorated in a modern, and artistic fashion.   Service: 2 stars- The servers at Kabuki are not attentive what so ever, once they get your order it seems like simply forever until you finally receive your food. Once, you finally do they will not give you the time of day from there on out. In fact, one time our server completely deserted us and a different server came and brought us our check. They never even asked how the food was. They spend more time talking to each other then tending to the customers."}
{"text":"I frequent this place almost weekly and can't get enough of the Albacore Crunch Roll!  My other favorites are the Sunkissed Roll and under appetizers the Broiled King Crab and the Calamari Rings.  Great food, great location, and always great service!"}
{"text":"Soy Romen is the bomb! Great lunch specials,  that's when I usually go because it's the cheapest.  Bathroom is crazy too, you'll trip out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with family and friends and have enjoyed the dining experience each time.  Plenty of free parking since it's located within the Tempe Marketplace.  (It's right across the Barnes and Noble Bookstore.)  The most we've had to wait for a table (even on busy Friday and Saturday nights) was 30 minutes.  Even though it was a turnoff when I once overheard waiters discussing the amount of tips they hope to receive from customers, service was professional and efficient overall.   1)  Sea urchin sushi, aka Uni ($7.50 for two pieces) - I've had it twice at Kabuki and both times, the Uni has tasted fresh!  Uni is definitely an acquired taste, but man, is it good!  It's an explosion of flavors and textures... at first light and creamy, then sweet, and then briny.  I love having Uni with sake or their lychee martinis ($8.95).  2) Dragon Specialty Roll ($12.95 lunch / $14.95 dinner) - This is my favorite roll at Kabuki.  They are very generous with the eel pieces.  The roll is shaped like a \"dragon\" and the eel is so delicate it practically melted in my mouth!   3) Paradise Specialty Roll ($10.95 lunch / $12.95 dinner) - This roll is very pretty to look at, and even more delicious to eat!  The roll contains a mix of mango, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and a few other items within the roll.     4) Dynamite ($8.95) - Baked clam, scallop, mushrooms and other veggies in a mayo sauce.  The dynamite served here is just ok.  It was a bit on the salty side and I even tasted a hint of curry powder.    5) Seafood Yaki Soba ($9.95 / lunch) -Soba noodles stir-fried with shrimp/scallop/calamari & veggies in a brown sauce.  The dish had good flavor and the portion was generously sized."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and flavors! Service on the other hand is either a hit or miss. I feel like there is always something new to try with the abundance of options. The Miso soup and salad are the best."}
{"text":"Husband and I had the seafood udon. It was amazing. We order it every time we come here . The waiter Jason was fantastic. We had a large party and he catered to us. Good job!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi restaurant here in Las Vegas.  Good service.  Good food.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and accidentally left my phone at the restaurant and called the next day to see if they had it (I have an iPhone so my location told me it was in fact there) and they informed me they did not have it. I continued to go back to look around the area with no luck so went into the restaurant to ask personally and they still insisted they did not have it anywhere .. Left very upset as in I knew they did have it, all they had to do was look! I got a call the next day saying they had it... Duh!!! Waste of my day and time and money. Will not be returning to such a lazy restaurant. Service = non existent"}
{"text":"One of my top japanese restaurants in Vegas hands down. The service was great, the staffs are nice friendly!! Everything we ordered was very tasty and fresh! My favorite menu is spicy seafood udon pasta! It's little spicy but good!! Also my favorite happy hour items are dynamite roll and alaskan roll, soooo yum!! I would highly recommend it for happy hour."}
{"text":"Not bad for Town Square~ Came an hour before last call on the weekend...lots of people but not overcrowded which means nice ambiance with quick service.  Had a lychee mojito and complimentary edemame in the lounge area....looking forward to coming back for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Our waiter was rude and they don't allow substitution on rolls. My husband asked if he could have cucumbers in his rolls rather than rice and among other things since he is on a diet. They said yes but it will cost double the price. We were not happy and made a comment about their policies and he started being rude to my husband. If we weren't to hungry we would have left. I'm not coming back to this place! And oh yeah, stay away from their vegetable ramen, they taste stale (old)!"}
{"text":"This place is big and popular seemingly might be more professional compare to some of the smaller family owned restaurants however it's funny how they can't seem to distinguish the difference between their regular sushi roll (the standard stuff on the menu) and a \"hand roll\" sushi roll. Hand roll  are more like an appetizer order for 1 person no sharing like other appetizers. So Stopped by one night since it opens late, haha on the bill they charged 13 dolla for 2 pieces of sushi 1 piece of avocado and 2 spoonful of rice wrapping in a piece of seed weed. Nice! But The best part is since they are bigger chain restaurants like that... I Don't think they give a damn whether they treat their customers right let alone minding about losing any customer. My Server wasn't even nice and friendly. If I was that server I would pay attention to small stuffs like that and make sure my customer don't get rip off. Unless you don't want your tip money but I think people tip you more if they know you are looking out for them. Anyway still leave them tip just didn't wanna ruin anybody night. Well play Kabuki!"}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp and vegetable tempura dinner entree no shrimp and a tofu roll with soy wrap and no cucumbers for take out. My tofu roll was made with seaweed and my vegetable tempura dinner came with no sauce for my tempura, I also received no spoon for my soup. I called to let them know that my order was wrong and the girl that answered the phone was very rude to me. She handed the phone off to another lady and she said she would make me a new roll and new tempura since my current tempura was now cold and never received the dipping sauce. I received the new roll and a sauce but no new tempura and it wasn't even worth the fight to and have them correct a third time: I spent $21 on food I didn't even eat and the only reason why I did take out is because every time I have ate in there my drinks have gone empty with no refill, the server never stops by and it takes forever to get my check. Never do I see a manager no one ever asks how was everything, I myself being a restaurant manager feel bad for your level of standards when it comes to customer service. I have been unimpressed serveral times and wasting my money of take out food today that took a total hour to get half way right was the cherry on top of a handful of times I've received bad service from your restaurant."}
{"text":"Great teriyaki chicken and california rolls! I'm not into sushi as much as my friends so I usually go for the go-to stuff at japanese places: teriyaki chicken and california roll! and this place makes it AWESOME. Chicken was perfect. Could've drank the sauce by itself if they offered!"}
{"text":"We seated outdoor, nice day and accompanied by dishes we ordered are all a notch better, no exception, than we used to have. That is something else. The service was also exceptional. All in all, an exceptional wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Went to Kabuki for lunch with my boyfriend and left very disappointed. We mostly enjoyed the food, but the service was atrocious.  Our server, Kim, was very rude and short with us for no reason. When asked any questions regarding the menu, she responded in an uncomfortably rude way. She brought my sushi before our appetizer and there was a long wait to get the appetizer and my boyfriends food. When clearing some of our plates, she took my glass of water without saying a word and walked away. She shortly returned with it refilled, but i was initially confused due to her lack of any kind of communication.  Kim was the entire reason we had such a poor experience. It's a shame because the rest of the staff seemed quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service.  Very original menu with lots of options aside from the typical sushi format."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy. Our server was friendly and super attentive. We ordered gyoza, spicy tuna crispy rice, a dragon roll, and ramen. The flavors were great as well as the presentation. Our dragon roll actually looked like a dragon! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because although the ramen was good, I have had better at a different restaurant in California."}
{"text":"don't understand how they are still in business?! ABSOLUTELY GROSS!!! stopped in for lunch today, on a business trip from vegas to get my sushi cravings filled. ordered 4 rolls, wayyy overpriced.. almost 100 bucks. DO NOT ORDER THE TUNA OR YELLOWTAIL. my yellowtail sashimi had dried crust around the cut of fish. my tuna was gross it was colored brown brown. couldn't even finish it. NOT EDIBLE and the service sucks as much as their sushi does!! you have been warned.. and I'm being nice right now. so embarassing."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for their sushi only, as that is all I have had, but it was delicious!!  I thought I had found my go to sushi restaurant at another location, but my husband and I decided to eat here on a whim and we were not disappointed.  All of their rolls were amazing and the staff very friendly.    Eat here for sushi!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, a friend and myself checked out Kabuki's happy hour on a Friday afternoon. It was surprisingly... dead. I think there was one other table. It got a little bit more busy later but still surprisingly slow for a Friday, I thought.  Their saketinis are sooo yummy. First, I got the creamy peach and that was very tasty.. sweet but not too strong. My second drink was the Fuji Apple saketini and that was.. kind of strong and it didn't taste like Fuji apples.. my friend said they put apple puckers in there.. that was all I could taste pretty much. I tried my friend's mango chu-hi (a sochu drink) and it was good.. kind of weak, but she said there is mango puree in there. yum!  For appetizers: -Spicy Tuna Salad ($4.95 HH) Spicy tuna on top of spring lettuce, shredded cucumber and radish sprouts. Good stuff, but I just don't like the ground up spicy tuna.. I like them in chunks! -Sesame Chicken ($4.95 HH)  -Salmon nigiri ($2.50 HH)  -Vegad Roll ($5.95 HH) -Agedashi Tofu ($3.95 HH)   They still have reverse happy hour, I think starting at 9pm. It used to buy select items and regular price and get the second item (in the same category) for a $1 but I think they did away with this.   Overall, their food and happy hour is good. I'd say regular price, they are kind of high. But that could be due to being located in a popular shopping center.. but who knows. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"The seafood prepared here was the least fresh I have had in Phoenix. I've had better results with the Sushi at Safeway or Trader Joes. The beer and wine menu also needs something to separate itself from every other restaurant. If you're looking for Sushi on the far West side, the only joint left after the demise of Be Sushi is Koi (across from the Arrowhead Harkins)."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a good 8-10 times.  Each time I found it pleasant.  Every time I have sat at the sushi bar.  Is it me or is that Salmon thingy they give to you (for free) the most insanely awesome piece of food I have ever had?  Wow that is good.  Luckily my wife does not like Salmon, so I greedily swoop up both pieces!    I have taken my brother (from FL) and one of my best friends (from TX) and they have both said that it was the best sushi they have ever had.  Sanchez and Chris make some mean rolls, to be sure.  The Lotus Roll is my second fave thing on the menu (first being that Salmon thing, and I do not even know if it is on the menu), that I have had so far.  Really good stuff.  The yellow fin and fatty tuna are great.  In short, I have never had anything here that I have not liked.  It may be pricey ($100 for two, not TERRIBLE) but I think it is worth it.  Say hi to Sanchez for me."}
{"text":"Although I love their sushi finding a maggot on the  edamame was absolutely disgusting. Never returning! To make matters worst he tried excusing this saying it was normal because it is organic and natural. Hmmm no!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. Attentive staff and food was presented as described on the menu. Me and my buddy both agreed that it was missing something tho that we couldn't put our fingers on (flavorwise). The rolls were just kind of plain (but good) without being exciting."}
{"text":"I would go with my friend 4 times a week to eat delicious food in total only problem is one waitress named Sam or Sui something with the letter S, she is Korean. Shocking acts once it has been taken for granted our order without asking what we would like to  order, and wrong. When we asked to return the dish she will resist and was angry at us, its service has become a nightmare, we end it replaced the dish and gave us the expense of the middle of the food, hinted that it is better for us to go. I went to sea again and the kids have tumbled down again, again a mistake on demand. Told us no choice eaten the mistake that was ordered and no chance to replace the dish. I ruined the meal I felt like crying. We have a restaurant chain and I'm stunned that there is such behavior on the part of a waitress. Shay end day customer is always right and he should come out with a smile and happy even if a mistake was made to order if it's on his part or on the part waitress is supposed to serve them on the bottom line. Too bad."}
{"text":"Had heard decent reviews of the sushi so decided to try on a Friday night for a place with a little more atmosphere and people watching. I'm a Sakana fan myself.   So, the first thing that sets me off is the fish smell when I walk in the door - not good to sour the stomach of this midwestern girl turned sushi lover with the smell of pond and old fish. I won't waste your or my time with obtuse banter so here is the rundown:  - Atmosphere: typical black and red Japanese decor  - Bathrooms: cool stone sinks that drip and slosh water on your feet so be aware  - Sashimi: overpriced, so-so quality, served in a glass bowl over ice  - Rolls: underwhelming  - Calipico soda: fabulous  - Deserts: yummy but small  - Birthday celebrations: abundant and noisy with little tambourines that lit up"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this places happy hour, I love the variety they have put on the menu and the atmosphere is fun and welcoming. Love love love the sangria and the peach saketini my favorite food item would be the firecracker, I usually have to order two so can take one home! Also they have a rewards program that is great for people that go here a lot, I've probably received 200 in gift certificate from all the rewards. I just wish they would Tay open later"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi on line. Got home and there wasn't any wasabi, soy sauce or chop sticks. Sushi had skin and pieces of membrane that hadn't been removed. The sushi looked old. It all went in the trash  worst sushi I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times throughout the years and this restaurant is always consistent. However, the miso is a hit and miss. I've got better pre-made miso at home in a packet. The sushi on the other hand is always good and prepared well and the service is good. I love the atmosphere and look of the bar and restaurant. A favourite for when I'm in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Great service by Yoann this evening. Very pleasant and the pace of meal was excellent this time around. Drinks were constantly filled and kept assuring if everything was good.  Super Bowl Sunday was a tame crowd and food was FRESH as ever! Thanks Kabuki for always being favorite!"}
{"text":"If you just need a place to hang out with friends with some drink and food, this is not a bad choice. But, if you are looking for an authentic Sushi place, then you come to the wrong place.  Happy hour is good. Menu seem pretty. Food was okay but may not always be at their best. Drink was okay.  Can be pricy for what the restaurant had to offer for sure.  Again, i don't hate it if I just need a place to sit down with friends around the area. But \"their food is awesome\" won't be one of the reason for my return."}
{"text":"Can,t really say what the Foods like . We went for lunch , waited 15min for server who never showed so we left . Free advice , get some management ."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday since they have a great happy hour. I had the California roll and Las Vegas roll. I did enjoy them, but my stomach has been upset all day today, if you catch my drift. For that reason I will not go back, because yesterday all I ate besides sushi was a frozen lean cuisine, so it's safe to assume I am sick from the sushi. Yucky"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch at Kabuki restaurant and while it served it's purpose the meal wasn't much above mediocre. We ordered the following:   Husband:   SAMURAI DELUXE - $10.95 Beef Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki, Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura   Me:   DYNAMITE ROLL - $4.25 (6 slices) Sauteed Vegetables, Crab   VOLCANO SUSHI #1 - $3.75 (2 slices) Baked spicy Tuna   VEGAS - $10.00 (not on menu) (6 slices)   SEAWEED SALAD - $4.95 Marinated Seaweed with Sesame oil and seed   MISO SOUP - $1.50   The sushi was just *ok*. The dynamite roll was the best in terms of flavor, the Vegas roll was tasty although Stingray's and Ra's is much better. I found the Volcano to be a little lacking in flavor and texture.   The seaweed salad was great, just like the kind I purchase at the Chinese market in the Cultural Center and priced comparatively.   The husband's tempura was sort of bland and the chicken and beef were fine. The green salad with miso and ginger dressing was very nice.   The decor is nice and the wait staff was attentive except towards the end when we were waiting for our check. Bathrooms were clean and orderly.   With food and drink and tax our check came to roughly $40. For lunch and considering the quality that was kind of pricey. There are other Japenese options on the west side of town that are much better.   If I were going for a work function and not footing the bill, I'd eat there. Otherwise there are too many other options at Westgate with the same view and better food."}
{"text":"Called before showing up to check if there was a long wait. Was told it was \"dead\". Got there with gf and was told by a rude employee that there was a 10-15min wait. We specifically asked for a booth seat. They sat us down 10min later at a table. We told them we asked for a booth. She said well you could wait at the front because they are all dirty. She then called up the people that got there after us and sat them down at a booth. I asked how that happened and she said we were put down for a table. Asked to speak with the manager and she said that they didn't do anything wrong and they were following seating schedule. Still told us to wait for them to clean a booth. The managers name was Kate. She was not helpful and acted like she could care less to serve us. We left. Come here often and this place has been getting worse every time. Will be finding a new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Great midday lunch. Nice atmosphere, great food, large menu selection."}
{"text":"We stopped by Kabuki on the way home from the Suns game a couple of weeks ago.  We weren't starving and wanted to try this place out, so we figured we'd give it a shot for a quick sushi fix.  The decor is somewhat typical trendy sushi bar - ultra modern and artsy - but pleasant nonetheless.  The music wasn't overly loud, and plasma televisions over the sushi bar were tuned to ESPN.  The place was relatively packed for an east valley restaurant at almost 11pm.  The crowd appeared to be mostly drinkers vs. eaters, as the noise level could attest; it felt more like a bar than a restaurant.  We sat at the sushi bar, and were disappointed to see that the sushi chefs were busily packing away and cleaning their stations for the evening.  Our server advised that last call would be in about 10-15 minutes.  We were unimpressed that we were not offered miso or edamame after we were seated.  The wait staff service was poor at both extremes -- painfully slow one moment, with the server hovering over us the next.  Our server brought menus and then stood and waited while we perused.  I told him we were just going to get sushi, so he insisted on taking our drink orders.  I ordered a Kirin and a glass of water (I didn't know how else to get rid of the guy!) and my companion (boyfriend sounds ridiculous at my advanced age) ordered sake and hot tea.  My beer was delivered quickly and cold, and then the server vanished.  The sake and tea didn't arrive until midway through our meal, after a second request.  Once I drained my water glass, it was never refilled, despite a request.  At the end of the meal we waited (and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited) for our check, and were finally able to snag our server to request the check as he flew past us.  This guy had only three modes:  anxious puppy (standing beside us with an expectant look on his face); falcon (flying past us at breakneck speed on his way to a mission); and invisible.  The sake list is nice, and quite extensive.  The menu is nearly intimidatingly (I don't think that's really a word) large, with both raw and cooked options.  The raw portion of the menu was adequate, though neither creative nor exciting.  We ordered toro sashimi, and for the money the portion was on the small side.  The normally buttery, smooth tuna belly was tough and chewy, a very unwelcome surprise.  We also ordered some nigiri and a couple of rolls.  The sushi was prepared quickly, and the chef was attentive enough to not toss everything at us at once, even though the evening clean-up process was well underway.  He presented the first couple of dishes, then waited a bit to bring forth more so that we weren't overwhelmed.  Each of the plates was presented beautifully.  The dishes themselves were very pretty -- they reminded me of sculpted ice.  The portions were smallish, but the fish was fresh.  The level of originality was about average, as was the taste.  The sushi prices were neither exorbitant nor cheap.  This overall dining experience can best be described as average, leaning heavily towards sub-par considering the wait staff service and unforgivable toro.  It dawned on me as we departed and were walking past the other patrons that we did not fit the target demographic for the restaurant.  Kabuki is a place geared towards a younger, Gen X type that is less interested in high quality dining and more interested in seeing and being seen.  This less-demanding patron is very satisfied with a chain-imposed menu.  He/she is happy eating California rolls made from \"crab\" with a K and drinking copious quantities of Grey Goose lychee martinis.  I'm not criticizing this demographic - it's just not my style."}
{"text":"Food for a BBQ ribs lunch special took forever .. 30 mins. Just a salad and ribs... Not again !"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I love sushi so we're very exited to see new sushi restaurant in our area. Unfortunately this place brought more disappointment then joy. Food was pretty average, service was slow, all thought restaurant was half empty. My fiancee was drinking Sprite but server refill his glass with water, we had to ask 3 times for more ginger and wasabi, just little things that make you very annoyed and wanting to never go back. I hope that owner of this place will hire better employees or help existing employees work on their customer service skills. I would hate to see such a beautiful restaurant in such a great location to go out of business because of poor service."}
{"text":"We have been to Kabuki quite a few times. Last night was our most recent visit before catching a movie. We have always been very happy with the quality of the food and the great value! We have turned on many of our friends to the place, and they all love it!    The Lotus roll is to die for!! Baked lobster on top of a california roll in an excellent sauce. My husband would eat only that if I let him! But, everything is good. The tempura mozzarella appetizer is excellent, also! The fish is always very fresh. Of course, don't forget your saki bomber!!   The happy hours are great, also. They have reverse happy hour during the week, also, where you can get drinks, rolls, sushi, etc. on a buy one get one for a dollar deal. The happy hour menu has many of their items on it. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi addict and so far Kabuki has been feeding my addiction well and better than any other sushi bar in the West Valley.   It is more Americanized sushi, but the fish is always fresh and top quality.  The only two complaints I have are that sometimes customer service is lacking and there seems to be a lot of specialty rolls made from the base of a California roll.  If you eat California rolls, that is not sushi in my book so I'm not a fan of seeing it all over the menu.    Other than that the food always comes out quickly, everything tastes great and is very fresh, and the whole vibe is relaxing.  It's very modern Asian decor that looks like an expensive restaurant but the prices are extremely fair.  They are always playing modern music that is hot at the moment which caters to most of the younger crowd that eats here.  The bar is stylish and the wine/sake list is quite good.    Some of my favorites have been the Lychee saketini, Sake Sangria, sesame chicken appetizer, spicy tuna roll, sunkissed roll, rose roll, uni, and the pyramid roll.  They also have a Red Mask club you can sign up for that gives you a $25 gift certificate for every $500 you spend over time and discounts on birthdays/anniversaries."}
{"text":"2 stars for decent service.   The sushi rice however, is always mushy and falling apart.   I love kabuki in California and they never seem to have this problem. I've given this place multiple visits and chances to see if maybe it was just off days, but they just don't have their sushi together apparently.   Work on that Alaskan roll sushi chefs!  Maybe Los Angeles locations can help you have better quality sushi.  The table booths seem dirty. The walls are nasty looking. The little glass separators always have finger prints. The sunshade has sauces all over them. It's dusty in table lights. Not a very clean atmosphere.   What is going on with this KABUKI in Las Vegas?!"}
{"text":"Really NOT a fan. The California roll, chicken teriyaki and tuna on crispy rice were awful. Returned most of my food. If you must, order the white rice. I did like the ambiance, and our server, Dustin, is one of the nicest servers I have ever met."}
{"text":"Love their food and happy hour specials. Only bummer is that the service is extremely slow and it is SO hot inside!"}
{"text":"We went to kabuki for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner. Not only was the food delicious, the service was wonderful, and they treated us to a complimentary dessert. Will definitely be going back and recommending. Great sushi!"}
{"text":"Great food at competitive prices.  The beef teriyaki was moist and tender.  The option to have brown rice with the meal pushed my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Loved this place. My home away from home kind of food. I got tired of the \"Strip\" food. Try their Kalbi!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'd give this joint three and a half stars, for the atmosphere. This place is very social, since it's the only sushi place in town square. Of you Ste going there for the sushi itself, I would try for another place further away from the strip. I got the different recommend rolls, and some yellowtail, and was satisfied, but unimpressed. For a good hangout, come here. For good sushi, not as much."}
{"text":"Yesterday my family and I went to Kabuki even after the experience with the service there is been horrible because we like the food but this las time is the last time we are going to eat there. I order tuna salad with fried calamari and 2 rolls keep in mind that this place is very expensive, my father in law order a roll and my wife order some rolls with appetizers. The food came all at one like a hurricane and very poorly executed. The rice on the rolls was horrible the rolls where to large and thin hard to grab with the shop stick, I been eating Japanese food for year and I am an expert with the stick and I can tell if the rice is been cooked properly. All the rolls where very small for the price and with out presentation, they fall a part and when I told the waiter to please take this back he said that the manager can only take half because I eat half of the roll. I personally think that the manager can even count because it came with 5 pieces and I returned 4 they fall a parts on my cloth ruining my shirt and causing a bad experience. This is the last time that we are going to eat here and if you think that this is not bad please walk in to the restroom first it is horrible I can only imagine how clean is the kitchen. We spent 150 dollars in a table of 3.! Bad place do not eat there."}
{"text":"So, hubby and I got stuck (literally) at Town Square last Halloween due to Town Scary (Halloween event on Sunday, October 31st).  You know, where kids walk past stores and trick-or-treat, etc.  There were ton of families milling about. Seriously, I've never seen so many people at Town Square before. We tried to leave at some point and realized that it would take us a good hour just to get out of the parking lot. At that point, we re-assessed plans to eat dinner at home and decided to eat at Town Square instead.  So we decided to check-out Kabuki because it was one of the restaurants at Town Square we hadn't tried.  Admittedly, I was a bit resistant to the idea of chain sushi restaurant at a big retail shopping center. So I didn't have the highest expectations. But -- big but -- I was pleasantly surprised! We sat at the sushi bar and had the following rolls:       --Vegas roll --Spider roll --Baja roll --Spicy tuna tempura roll  Two initial thoughts: the Vegas and Baja rolls were the bomb.  The Baja roll was not only different, but excellent.  It had jalapeños and pico de gallo on top. It was sooooo good! It was light, fresh, and flavorful. Same goes with the Vegas roll. I am a big fan of tempura sushi and cream cheese in rolls (which I know not everyone is a big fan of), so this was the best of both worlds.  I've subsequently visited during Happy Hour. The Happy Hour specials are off a smaller menu, but still nothing to sneeze at. I had some cucumber concoction and it was delicious.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you don't eat meat, and you have to be in Las Vegas for an extended period of time, your diet will consist of onions, olives, various types of lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes (fries, mashed, etc), bread and cheese.  So you can understand my desperation and excitement when we came across Kabuki today.  I mean, in comparison to Japanese restaurants in California (Northern and Southern), Kabuki is mediocre.   But...For me, today, it was like a thirsty man stranded in the desert for extended periods of time tasting his first drink of water in weeks.    I ordered a veggie roll, slathered it with wasabi and had a foodgasm right there in front of all my co-workers.  I also ordered shoyu ramen, the noodles were overcooked and the broth was tasteless, but beggars can't be choosers....So this place gets 3 stars.  BTW, they have $1 Happy Endings...Sweet! (see photo)"}
{"text":"Love the food!   Food: They have a wide range of options. The quality is expert, except the crispy rice is not cooked he way it should be. It was cooked like fried rice. That was my only complaint about the goods. The beef was cooked really well. My boyfriend and I shared a beef, tempura, and sashimi platter which came with rice, salad, and soup. The kabuki sushi special was very good and I recommend it!   Drinks: good with a decent price. My sakerita was prepared a little sloppy with the sugar on the outer glass wall rather than the rim.   Service: I think we lucked out, because our server wasn't as great as the other servers we saw around us. She took a while to give the wasabi we requested, which meant we didn't take our first bite into our sushi until 10-15 minutes after we finally got it. It also took a while for her to pick up our card, considering we wanted to leave for other plans.   Ambience: It's casual and not well lit. There are so many sitting options: inside, outside, table, booth, and sushi bar.   Wait Time: We waited less than 30 minutes to be seated on a Saturday night around 6.   Parking: It's at Tempe Marketplace, so there are a lot of stalls, but it usually gets full since there are a lot of restaurants, however it shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to find parking.  Overall, I would return."}
{"text":"Smelly Loud Pretentious for no good reason at all Overpriced  But the worst thing for someone like me, as a vegetarian, is that there are perhaps two items on the entire menu from which to choose.  I don't mind macguyvering a meal out of the appetizer section, but come on! All you have is tofu or edamame? No thanks."}
{"text":"Service was good. The food was absolutely disgusting. They raised the prices on some of their items. The dynamite roll there used to be my absolute favorite. I remember the price of a dynamite roll used to be no more than $5, now they raised the price to almost 9 bucks!! Totally not worth the price and when I ordered it the other day it seems as if they changed up the ingredient. I don't ever remember them putting crab mix on top. Less scallops, onions and mushrooms. Even the sauce was different.  The miso ramen lost all it's flavor. I ordered one of their newest items, the ebi takoyaki, and that was disgusting as well. I basically ordered $60 of food, took one bite of every thing and was done for. The only thing that tasted decent was the edamame and my oolong tea."}
{"text":"My first time being there the ice water glass was so hot from the dish washer that when the cold water was poured in it, the bottom of the glass broke and spilled all over me. I was pretty upset, however the manager rushed over and gave us free appetizers and comped our meal. The food was really good. The ramen soup is amazing! I keep going back because not only is the food good but the service is great as well!"}
{"text":"Food ok...Service ok.  The only reason I give them 3 stars and not 2 is the location...and the happy hour.  Vegas has so many GREAT AYCE places with better fish...the quality of fish is pretty poor at Kabuki."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place and we dropped by for lunch on Christmas day. To my surprise, they were open!!! I guess this is Vegas after all. Service was extremely good. Friendly staff and always accessible.  Menu had a lot of variety and specialty sushi. My favorite was the Anago Tempura Roll. I wasn't too thrilled about their ramen though."}
{"text":"I had booked a table on opentable.com for our family with 2 kids. Upon arrival we very almost immediately showed to our table. Not only was it in a quiet corner spot as requested but it came prepared with 2 kids menus in addition to regular ones. (Btw - the kids menus are awesome). Needless to say, the kids very happy.  Now the food: once you make those difficult choices on what to order (the menu is HUGE), you'll get excellent food one after the other. The cold noodles (always forget the name) were delicious. The garlic steak terrific. Need to add that the service is top notch. And after all that food - which is plenty - you will like that the check is very reasonable.  To sum it up: one of the best dining experiences we had as a family in a long time. We'll be back and I would recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"There is no reason to pay full price for sushi so I always go to the happy hour.  Even for dinner or something, unless someone is truly set on going out for sushi I try for the discounted sushi.  I actually prefer Kabuki's sushi then RA, they are bigger pieces and better tasting in my opinion.  Recommendation: To anyone that wants a good deal for happy hour and is hungry during an awkward 4 o'clock lunch when your class gets out."}
{"text":"I really like this place for sushi. They have the option to have sushi rolls with brown rice instead of white. and every roll ive had there has been amazing. I really like the set up of the place as well."}
{"text":"For a restaurant located in the upscale Bayview Village mall, I wasn't expecting much better than this.  It's been my unequivocal experience that more expensive food simply doesn't taste better.   I'd rather do a hole in the wall sushi joint.  Kabuki looks pretty. The tables are fancy. Servers dress up in traditional Japanese garb. The restaurant is right next to the upper scale Oliver and Bonacini's.   My spicy salmon wraps (which, just to clarify, consisted of four small rolls wrapped in rice paper, which were the size of regular rice sushi) cost 13.00. WTF!  A simple set of avocado rolls cost 8.00.  Ummm...... no thank you."}
{"text":"I ate at this location for the first time and I LOVED it!  We ate at the sushi bar.  They will customize your sushi.  We had chicken udon- $10 very good and portion was huge!    Albacore sushi $12.95- Excellent choice!  Very good sushi.  Spicy tuna roll was very good.. About $10.  For my drinkers-  wine and the sakarita was yummy.    My only advice there is to come early because the weekend line is crazy (but worth it).  ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to \"Kabuki\" restaurants in other cities to my great disappointment, but not this one.   Great atmosphere, excellent happy hour & reverse happy hour deals on sake bombs & good sushi rolls.   Lots of choices for non-sushi eaters too.  Everything is tasty.  Service is generally excellent.   A nice choice if you find yourself in the center of town.  Good bar selection.  Easy to access, compared to many Town Square establishments."}
{"text":"Spicy udon pasta was too salty. I had to drink lots of water. Avocado & eel roll and rainbow roll were ok, nothing special. My server forgot our salad. Salad came out at last after we almost finish our main dishes. I don't want to recommend for this place. Find other sushi restaurants in town. There are lots of better Japanese places in Vegas. It was my first time and never again."}
{"text":"So this was my first time going to Kabuki, lets just say I'm never going there again.  Here is my experience:  So right when I walk in, I see people gather around the door way waiting, I see two people at the front counter (I assume was the hostess) just talking to each other too busy in their own world, I went up to them and informed them 'table for 2' they tell me it's a 15 min wait time, I'm like okay that sound pretty good.  After telling me the wait, the person I was talking to doesn't ask if I wanted to wait or for my name, I actually have to ask them if they needed my name.  After they wrote my name down, I waited next to the door, I noticed several people walking in look around and the \"Hostess\" doesn't even greet them (giving them the hostess the benefit, I assume they are busying looking for next available table for us who has been waiting). So 20 minutes later I'm still waiting, but I see 4 different group of people finish with their dinner and already checked out and left the restaurant but no one's name has been called since I walked in.  40 minutes later, the hostess started to call people from the list, so thinking to my self \"Oh we should be next since we came in after those couple\" sadly we were next in the list but they skip us and seated the couple who just walked in.  I went to the hostess and ask them why was the couple who came in after us given a table, the hostess actually brought up the list and that's when I noticed that my name was on the first list and all the other name after mine was crossed off and they were sitting people on the second list.   So I just told them, to cross my name off the list and walk out.  I can't say much about the food since I didn't get a chance to eat any due to the stinky customer service."}
{"text":"subpar commercial sushi I know there isn't a lot of great sushi options here in Vegas but I would try some of the  less branded ones before going back to this joke of a place I gave an extra star only for service"}
{"text":"I've lived in Japan, so I'm a bit of a  sushi \"snob.\" In addition, I'm always a bit worried about ordering sushi in a land-locked state! That aside, I have been consistently happy with their appetizers and meals. I've been very happy with their sushi and sashimi. I normally go there for lunch, and haven't been disappointed. The portions are big and the prices are reasonable. I've only been there for dinner, with a  vegan friend, and we had no trouble finding lots of vegan-friendly dishes. The service is fast and the staff are always friendly and knowledgable. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!! But nothing is that great and they give lots of issues with substitutions.... People are picky when it comes to raw fish.... You need to allow for substitutions and not make a big deal about it!!! Also, don't charge for it.... If I want more salmon instead of tuna what is the bfd! I want to like you!!! I do.... Also, your drinks sound amazing, but aah.... Your noodle soups sound good, but aah.... Step it up!"}
{"text":"ive been going to this place since I lived in cali, there is one on Hollywood blvd I believe, its dependable fresh and even though we are in the dessert (no desert) its like you are buy the ocean, that's how fresh the fish really is. Its great and the entrees I haven't had a bad or mediocre thing there yet, some of my recommendations are the pork ramen, sashimi salad, the thai coconut shrimp and the spicy yellowtail roll, they are all great and I really cant complain about anything there, not the service, the food, its all fantastic."}
{"text":"Big place, lame service in the sense that appetizers come out after mains and kids' meals after the grown-ups. They got you hooked though if you're from out of town because it's hard to find 'real' places to eat! Rolls don't taste like much of anything although the garlic edamame was fried and delicious. Makes you wonder why places like this invest so much $ in 'the show' and apparently so little in the food!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place more than I can count, and the service is always amazing. Absolutely fantastic servers"}
{"text":"It is tradition that my brother and I go for sushi when he braves the heat down here. I can't imagine a better combination to welcome him with then heat and raw fish. But it works in this crazy desert!  We like to try different places and while we were shopping at Tempe Market Place we thought that this might be a decent little place for some good ol' fashion rolls.  When we arrived it looked like your traditional hip cool martini/sushi bar. The hostess was very nice and sat us immediately. Pretty soon after the server arrived to take drink orders and my bro and I looked over the extensive list of rolls. I must say they have a pretty inventive list. One roll was called the brain (If memory serves me correctly) and it was a blob of fish mix and red sauce. Pretty gross to look at but not bad.  My only complaint with this place is the service (if you have read any of my reviews this is what will always get you in the end). After our server took our drinks, we really didn't see much of her till our bill. NOT a good impression to someone who has been in the industry since she was 16. The sushi was ok, nothing I would say my brother and I are dying to go back for. But if you are looking for more atmosphere and pretty people then quality...Kabuki is your place!"}
{"text":"The fish is always fresh and weather you want Japanese soba, sushi OR my favorite, SAKI they have it all"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour deal in Town. We went on a Thursday night and the deal starts from 9PM till closing. We had 4 rolls, two 22oz Beers, and two orders of hot sake in those white ceramic jars. All that for $24.54. Edamae was free for appetizer.  Simply can't beat the price. Service was friendly and the food took a bit of time, but not long considering how bus  the place was. The rolls tasted better than average and they were fresh. We had the spicy tuna roll (my fav), the scallop roll, the Philly roll, and a salmon roll. Each roll is the standard 6 pieces. Four rolls were enough for my wife and I.  This place is out a bit farther, but it's really fast to get here from anywhere on the strip. Either drive 15 mins or take a bus, the GOLD one, and it will get you there in about 20 mins. Worth the trip. The mall is packed with good stores (Apple, H&M, Blue Martini bar, Borders, etc)."}
{"text":"It was horrible and we will never go back. The place wasn't even busy and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table, then 20 more minutes for our 1 item order and the portions are super small now. We used to love this place, it used to be awesome. We definitely won't be returning to this place EVER!  The portions are small now, the service is super slow and the front hostess station with three girls standing there is clueless. The bar wasn't even open during the day when we had to wait for our table and the place wasn't even packed. SORRY NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch! Friday night great service, great food, great atmosphere! Great price! Our server Spencer was awesome. We could not leave until we ate everything. Sushi was wonderful as was everything else we were served. WILL be back again."}
{"text":"Kabuki is one of my favorites. I like their spicy tuna and Aladdin roll. The lotus on fire roll is amazing! Love the happy hour menu. They also have great ramen for when its cold out."}
{"text":"I came here with a date on a Saturday night. It was 10-15 minutes for a table so we sat at the Sushi Bar. My first time here and I loved it! My only regret is that I did not review the entire menu as there was so many delicious options to choose from. We were in the mood for Sushi rolls and we ordered accordingly. We shared the Lotus on Fire Roll (not as hot I thought would be) the Spider Roll and the King Crab Cucumber Wraps. The Lotus and the Spider Roll were absolutely some of the freshest sushi I've ever had. The cucumber wrap which my date ordered was so-so! She was having problems with her stomach and thought it would help but it didn't! But I tried and although fresh, it was nothing of note! Service was good! The servers that served the sushi bar also served in the dining areas of the restaurant. So if you needed something you had to flag your server down as he was passing to pick up cocktail orders from the service bar. Not a problem as he came by quite frequently! Check out the bathrooms, very cool and even better after you had dinner, go out and see the beautful fountains in the courtyard below! Not on the same level of Times Square in New York or the Bellagio in Las Vegas, but its just a cool place to hangout and chill after a pleasant evening of sushi at Kabuki! I will be back and this time to try other menu options!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I will never be back. I am on a very restricted diet but love sushi. I ordered two rolls and asked for no rice. I have done this at other sushi restaurants with no issues but here they told me they can't do it and wouldn't even try. I know it is said a lot but I actually have been in the restaurant industry for over ten years and currently manage one so this service is unacceptable. I could go make it myself easily."}
{"text":"I came here half a year ago, because my Chinese friend posted some sushi pic online, it looked very delicious, then I thought I should have a try.   I can not remember which sushi did I order, but it was quite good. the safe food noodle has a huge portion..  It is a neat Japanese  restaurant, if u like Japanese foods, here would be the best choice."}
{"text":"I have been to Kabuki several times while shopping at the Outlet Mall across the street. This past weekend, I took my husband and 8-year old grandson there for lunch.  It was my grandson's first time at a Japanese restaurant, and he enjoyed it very much. But then again, what kid doesn't like teriyaki chicken?  Kabuki offers a kids menu.  My grandson is a big eater so we normally don't order off kids menu for him, but not knowing if he would like the food, we didn't want to order off the regular menu.  No problem!  The portion was definitely not kiddy size...large enough for an adult.    We ordered the calamari appetizer, which was good and not too chewey.  It comes with two dipping sauces (wasabi mayo and spicey teriyaki).  I don't care for spicey, but the spicey teriyaki was not spicey at all.    Hubby had a variety of sushi (no complaints from him), and I had the teriyaki salmon.  Anyone who knows me know that I like good food and a lot of it!  The lunch menu did not skimp.  In fact, it seemed larger than the last time I came here.    Wish there were a Kabuki closer to home!"}
{"text":"This place has very good vegan options. The Tofu Steak was delicious. They also have really good selection of lemonade. It's been really hot so I was able to drink a lychee lemonade, a mango lemonade, and a raspberry lemonade as free refills. The waitress was sweet and even gave us a to go cup.  A must go if you are craving Japanese food that's definitely reasonably price for the portion.  5 happy stars!!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you must avoid gluten. In my experience, it seems this restaurant, like so many others, advertises gluten free options, but the preparation is not safe for those with celiac disease who must avoid gluten for health reasons -- not for a fad diet reasons. I went to Kabuki on 7/14/15 for HH with friends. Prior to going, I called ahead to speak with the staff about how foods were prepared in a safe way for celiacs. The staff member said all the right things, but that's the only happy part of this story. The first bad sign was that my server had never heard of gluten, and he looked unconcerned when I asked him to ask the chef to prepare my roll with a clean knife and cutting board and bamboo mat to avoid cross-contamination. And apparently that didn't happen, because I got very sick afterwards. The food always tastes good, and the HH is cheap, but it's not worth the short-term pain and perhaps long-term health ramifications if you're a celiac."}
{"text":"This place is great.  A nice break from the loud bar scene.  Try the fried dumplings, Baja roll, and Alaska roll.  All delicious.  Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic! Never a bad meal :) Also have had the pleasure of having Ashley as my waitress and the service she provided was the best I've ever had! Great waitress!"}
{"text":"I really loved the GOBO!  Just kidding!  Gobo is not Carrots!  I guess im picky with Japanese food and still looking for the magic spot in LV."}
{"text":"This place must be used to constant flow of new customers brought in by the adjacent stadiums.  i say that because I cannot see why anyone would specifically choose to return.  Not that the place was horrible - but Like the 2-star guideline says \"meh - I've had better\".    Lets start with the service.  We got there before the stadium crowd showed up and placed out order.  Evetuanllyt the crowds streamed in, took theor seats, ordered and were served.  And we continues to wait - no server in sight.  After about 25 minutes and all the tables around us being seated in served while we wated in hunger, the server stoppped by to say our order would eb coming soon.  Clearly they must ahve forgotten the order, but no admission, no apology.  After the ffod finally arrived, I sat for a long time with an empty cup of tea befoer a refill arrived. And another long wait for the check.  Now the food - I ahve toa dmit that a few things were really good.  The yellowtail tartar starter, served with a layer of green fish egg (not sure what kind) on top, was luscious.  i regretted sharing with the husband, as I could ahve eaten it (plus a second one!) by myself.  The lobster roll and soft shell crab roll were also delicious.  Not too sweet, not too filed with mayo and only a touch of Krab-with-a-K (it should be illegal).  We hoped the salmon and snapper sashimi would round out the meal and make us forget about the long wait... but sadly, they were both soft and mealy-textured, and not worth the stomach space after the tasty rolls.  The bathrooms have angled walls that can be a bit disorienting, but rather funky in an OK way, despite the been-there-done-thatness of the theme.  It was the floor drain that was covered over in strips of masking tape that had become stained with dirt and grime that yucked me out.  In the stalls, facing the wall when I entered all looked clean (except the yucko-max drain tape),  Upon taking a  seat and viewing the walls of the stall, I say the bottom 2 feet of the stall walls were filthy.  I guess whoever clean the bathrooms only faces in the stalls and never turns around.  Bleh.  The server, when he made his infrequent visits to our table, was kind and courteous (except for treating our wait like a matter of course).  As a result we weren't quite as miffed about our $90.00 (no alcohol) dinner as we otherwise would have been.  It's amazing what simply being nice can overcome.  unfortunately, not enough to make it beyond 2 stars"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming to Kabuki to eat at least once a month for the past 3 years and we have yet to have a bad experience. We are HUGE sushi fans but are both extremely picky regarding the quality of sushi we eat. Every all you can eat place or hole in the wall sushi places we've gone to have been nothing but bad news but this place has yet to disappoint. The food is always fresh and the servers always have fantastic customer service. Angie is one of the servers there and we usually request her because she is incredible. Our food is always out quickly, our drinks are always refilled when needed, and she never forgets to ask us about our meal. The manager there also does a great job with the restaurant and is very involved. You can tell she does a great job to make sure everyones experience is up to par. I recommend Kabuki to any sushi lover or to anyone trying to experience sushi for the first time. The problem is once you go, no other place will meet up to its standards."}
{"text":"I love sushi and Kabuki delivers (not actual delivery-- but it is good). I have been going here for the past 2 years, at least a few times a month. Let me give some examples:  - Free edamame with a sushi order (usually most sushi restaurants charge $3-5 for this) - Philadelphia roll? $5.95 - Volcano roll? They have a knock off version (equally as good) for $5.95 as well. - Happy hour is awesomely priced - Upscale, modern, clean atmosphere - Good quality-- Solid B+/A- - Seated quickly - Conveniently located (for me) @ Tempe Marketplace.  I hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Kim is an amazing waitress. She is professional and the pinnacle of kindness. She knows her job so well and is a master of her craft."}
{"text":"The Japanese Lasagna, BBQ beef ribs, Koshou Beef, and the Banana Tempura is satisfaction guaranteed! Get the Kabuki Red Mask Rewards card -great savings if you like Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Eh. Not a whole lot to say- pretty mediocre. Went for happy hour, pretty decent happy hour prices. The food itself is nothing to write home about, not authentic obviously but that's not why you come here. Not terrible just not terrific."}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi place for Happy Hour.  The poke bowls are great and the combinations for lunch are good too.  If you want good service ask for Supa, who always remembers us and what we like to eat!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! A real winner! It's THE place for sushi in Las Vegas! We love Angie, the server!"}
{"text":"Great service by Paul! Great food for the kids! Great rolls for the wife n I!! I wish we had one in San Diego! 3 rolls, 2 kids huge kids meals, 4 drinks all for $49.30!!!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Compared to the town square location service is not quite there yet.  My wife ordered veggie roll which was good, and for myself its chicken teriyaki with bbq beef ribs.  They put my order in wrong as some dinner deluxe combination, and after being surprised when dinner is served i questioned the waitress on why i have extra food (shrimp, tempura veggies, etc).  I'm told that is what it comes with, okay...  This is not my first time ordering this dish at Kubuki as we dine at the town square location but i don't press it.  Then i start to eat the beef ribs, and i freakin break a chopstick trying to chew off this gristle.  This is not right the town square location these ribs are absolutely awesome melt in your mouth.  I inform the waitress these are not right, so manager comes by to apologize.  No offers to fix it, etc.  no big deal i just chalk it up to learning curve for this place.  Then i get the bill, and sure enough they charged me for the wrong entree.  Back comes the manager to correct it.  Then i try to pay the bill using my 15% off grand opening coupon i got at the town square location and the server comes back to tell me i cant use it with other discounts.  It turns out instead the manager applied some newspaper advertisement discount or something instead of taking care of the problem.  In the end she removed the entree and applied the 15% discount which is fine.  I would rather pay full price to have a relaxing and enjoyable meal but it just didn't happen here.  It was one thing after another, nothing like the town square location.  I might give this place a few months to get it together then try again.  Its a beautiful location with much potential."}
{"text":"Kabuki (Tempemarket Place) used to be my favorite sushi restaurant until recently when I had what can be described as one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. We placed our order about 3-5 minutes prior to the start of happy hour (after waiting about 30 minutes to be seated). When it was time to pay, our check did not reflect the happy hour prices. Our waitress was new and she admitted that she forgot to wait to put in the order after happy hour had started. She obviously couldn't do anything about it so I asked to talk to her manager. This is when I became beyond disillusioned with this restaurant. The manager (Ashley) was beyond rude. She actually said it was OUR fault for sitting before happy hour had started. She was very condescending. I really could not believe she was the manager. I am very disappointed. Sadly, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is FAR better than their Tempe Marketplace location. If you are looking to visit a kabuki location, make sure you go to westgate and NOT Tempe!"}
{"text":"Came back here with a few friends when we were in Vegas and they all enjoyed it. The sushi is fresh and the sashimi is nice thick cuts, not the thin wafer pieces that most places serve. It's a little away from the strip but the drive is not far at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. I rarely write bad reviews because opinions vary and everyone has their own taste, so just because I don't like the food at a restaurant doesn't mean I should put them down. However, this goes beyond that. I went there with my girlfriend last Friday. Since that day, we have been extremely sick! I don't want to go into details, to avoid grossing anybody out, but it hasn't been pretty. I'm worried it's food poisoning and we haven't been able to eat anything without it staying down. We don't have health insurance and can't afford going to see a doctor. I called them to see about getting a refund for the 80 dollars spent there and they just said sorry no refunds and hung up on me. You get us sick and can't even compensate that by giving us our money back? This has been horrible."}
{"text":"Don't have time to write a full review but this place never disappoints! Best sushi in Tempe."}
{"text":"Im a sushi fanactic. Tonight was the first time i ate here. This sushi restaurant didnt seem to suprise me. The service was sad. The girl had ignore me and walked away  when i went up to the register and try to pay. The food doesnt taste like how they appear. The salad is full of watered down veggies. The sushi is rolled loosely so it would look big. Not one of the best but is the worst. Never again will i come here for dinner. Yama sushi on maryland prky and flamingo is good. Sushi Mon on Sahara is awesome. Ra at the fashion show mall is also delicious!!! :)"}
{"text":"Lisa is the best server at Kabuki. Her sequence of service, attention to detail, timeliness, courteous demeanor and menu knowledge are the reason we return over and over. She gave us PERFECT service today. I had special order spicy tuna rolls and add a slice of jalapeño and drop of srircacha on each one.  Edamame & miso soup was hot and served in sequence first....then creamy baked lobster rolls with cream and eel sauces and our favorite.......the lobster dynamite....this is sautéed mushrooms and sweet onions in a skillet with lobster bites accompanied by avocado bites and covered with melted cheese.....we won't forget and we can't wait to return THANK YOU, LISA, & Kabuki"}
{"text":"Best place for sushi especially during happy hour. I personally wouldn't pay full price outside of HH, but still great quality and always a friendly staff. Don't forget to try the sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"Great picture menu. Ramen wasn't bad. Sushi has always been tasty and the presentation is beautiful. My husband and I sit in the bar and we always get good service from the bartenders. Best cucumber martini in phx. This is a restaurant we would take family and friends to if they visit."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour with my boyfriend. I got the California roll and the dynamite roll and it was delicious. Probably should have gotten something different rather than the California roll because the dynamite roll was basically the same except with the dynamite topping. None the less, they were both awesome! Service was quick and great. Definitely would come again for their dinner device!"}
{"text":"It was decent. My girlfriend and I love sushi and have traveled for good sushi and heard this place getting rave reviews. The atmosphere is great along with decorations and service was superb. The food was below standards. Salmon nigiri a little fishy and my tuna nigiri was actually tough. Spicy tuna and spicy crab roll are cut into 6 BIG pieces instead of the normal 8. Probably won't be back due to the option of many other great sushi places in the area. 3 stars for service and overall experience."}
{"text":"Unable to review the food as no server showed up after being seated on the balconey.  We left after waiting 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Today at Kabuki we had an awesome experience. Our waitress was Dona she was awesome. Started with a Mango Lemonade then right into salad and miso soup, great as always. Next came our sushi rolls, Lobster Roll, Hamachi Aburi Roll, and Lotus on Fire Roll. All were awesome. Main courses came we had the Teriyaki Salmon with Tempura Shrimp and Vegetables, and The Ninja Deluxe.. needless to say we were so stuffed so that meant no desserts, but we were offered. We were also offered drinks to go but we were to full. See you next time"}
{"text":"We live in Arizona. The middle of a desert. So, anyone looking for really fresh, awesome, melt in your mouth sushi... get on a plane and go someplace that is closer to the ocean.  Kabuki is pricey but their fish is as fresh as you will get (considering fish has to be flown in and you can't get it right off the boat like you can in Vancouver, Seattle, San Fran, etc) in Phoenix.  Happy Hour deals are pretty good. Also, they are located in Tempe Marketplace. There are not that many decent restaurants (only crappy chain restaurants like Ruby Tuesdays, the Keg, etc.) around there. So, after a movie or some easy shopping, Kabuki is a good place to go to have a couple of sake bombs and a few light apps."}
{"text":"the crab salad is bomb, great place to go during happy hour. really enjoyed the sushi too. our waitress seemed kind of tired and ready to go home tho lol."}
{"text":"They have the best soups in the world and a very decent sushi.    Costumer service is good and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"1st time here its pretty good, they have good prices best time to go is during happy hour they have pretty good specials"}
{"text":"Good food, dismal experience otherwise.   I came in from out of town for New Year's to visit my sister and her boyfriend, who live in Henderson. They love Kabuki back from when they lived in So Cal. I wanted to treat them to a nice NYE meal, so we made reservations here, which were available on Open Table at 815, 830, and 845.  Our reservations were for 815 but we were running 15 min late so I called ahead. I was assured it was no problem, though was also advised that they had \"last call\" for both food and drink at 845, which seemed odd since their last res was for 845.   Upon our arrival, the hostess looked a bit put out and reminded us of the 845 \"last call\", but also assured us that we were welcome to stay in the restaurant as long as we liked so as to not feel rushed. We were quickly able to give our drink order and our server came by about 5 minutes later. We had to very quickly decide what our entire order would consist of, including all sushi/rolls, etc. This turned out fine, but I didn't appreciate having to order everything up front.  Our server was polite, but it quickly became quite obvious that the restaurant staff were closing the restaurant down, to the degree that 15 minutes after having our food, our server was coming to get our soy sauce bottle \"out of the way\" - to which I objected as we were obviously still in the middle of dinner. He then dropped the bill off a very short time later. Having felt rushed from the moment we entered the restaurant, I asked to speak with the manager. She assured we could stay \"as long as we liked\", though didn't so much as offer any apology for our treatment - quite frankly, she was probably directing them to close as quickly as possible.  The 2-stars was because the food was quite good, otherwise it would've been one star. I don't understand for the life of me why a restaurant would advertise having reservations available on any night, let alone NY Eve, up until 845 when they're closing at 9pm - and won't offer any additional access to food or drink after 845. I haven't felt this unwelcome in a restaurant for years, if ever. Very disappointing experience for us all, and they've now lost my sister and her bf as customers as well."}
{"text":"Consistency seems to be an issue with their spider rolls but man when they are on point, I find myself in soft shelled crab heaven ~ ~ ~ I have tried them a total of four times. Twice during the week for lunch and twice during weekend dinner... so far they are hit or miss, having been amazing during one dinner and one lunch and disappointing during one dinner and one lunch. I am writing this today because it was literally going to be the last chance i gave them on their spider rolls and they blew me away. I really hope that when i come back they won't let me down."}
{"text":"sitting here food was good but really disappointed in the service. We were sat in a section not as busy and that apparently led our waiter to focus on other areas. nearly every time we needed a refill of beverages we had to flag down a buser or the hostess as she walked by. To top it all off the buser spilled a beverage on the table next to us and hit me. no additional napkins or apologizes were provided leaving me to sit here with whatever sticky drink that was. this was a very unexpected experience."}
{"text":"Great sushi! I was in town for Fiesta Bowl and stopped by for lunch. Service was excellent. Sushi presentation was beautiful and the quality was first rate. Nice selection and choices."}
{"text":"Great place! Amazing service and delicious sushi. Now that Kona Grill is under construction this is our place of choice for sushi."}
{"text":"So I can say that I come to kabuki around 2-3 days a week. I have never been so upset ! Yesterday we went like usual and I asked for a Vegas roll it was disgusting!!! I have tried the Vegas roll and never been this bad really oily I promise that I ate only one and l left the hole plate and of Course I paid for it because I don't like to complaint and not paying but I decided that I was going to pay it even though it was disgusting and did not ate it besides the bad roll our server gave us a really bad customer service like did not pay any attention to our table and it was yesterday Monday no people... I asked her for my mango iced tea I had to remind her and finally got never served my mango tea how I wanted.... Her name was xaviera or linde? Idk but bad bad server...  My favorite server is HUY he is the best always paying attention to us and already know us because we go so often but yesterday was a really bad day at kabuki and i don't know if I'm going again!! I'm upset  ... but still love sushi lol"}
{"text":"I don't eat sushi. I stick with other menu items when I eat Japanese. The group of 8 I was with was not impressed by the sushi served at this place.  The sushi didn't seem to be as fresh or the fish as high of quality as other places.  This group eats sushi all the time. Among the lowlights was one person put a roll in her mouth only to come across a tooth pick that was meant to hold the roll in place (i'm assuming), but was broken somewhere along the way.  I wasn't impressed with what I had-some beef item and some sesame chicken. I should have just drank my beers and had the enaname and nothing else.  The one bright spot was the happy hour beer, drinks and the lower cost of the food items during happy hour. Everyone would have been really irked if we had to pay full price for the food since there was little to no enjoyment there.  Service was pretty slow and took awhile to get the check..   This place would be at the bottom if not the bottom of Japanese/sushi places in/around Tempe."}
{"text":"I eat here about twice a month, the lotus roll is by far my favorite. Only complaint is that at times it has not been real lobster  but they do not tell you. It still tasted ok, but sometimes you get lobster, and sometimes you get shrimp but your still paying for lobster. Also love the crab miso soup, but pretty salty if you're on a low sodium diet."}
{"text":"Went to Kabuki last night on a date. My first time trying sushi.  Now let me state... I consider myself to be fairly open-minded about food, and willing to try new dishes. I'd always avoided sushi because 1) I was worried that I would be repulsed by the texture and 2) sushi is such a broad dish that it can be very intimidating to order. I learned new lessons last night.  I ordered the cha-siu Ramen. It was cold and windy outside, so noodles and broth sounded perfect. My date ordered the spicy tuna roll, a screaming orgasm with fresh wasabi, and the geisha roll.   I have nothing to compare it to, obviously, but everything was delicious, particularly the screaming orgasm. It is an appropriately named dish. Everything tasted very fresh, and the flavors all complemented each other harmoniously. The ramen was really good as well... the pork was a touch overcooked, at least for me, but the broth was warm and spicy, with perfectly cooked noodles.  The service was spot on and the ambiance was inviting and comfortable. I look forward to trying new dishes next time."}
{"text":"I came with a large party on Saturday evening 9/23. My review is solely based on service. I can't say if the food is any good because I never actually received my order. We were a large party and everyone else received what they ordered. I addressed the issue with the server and she said she was checking on it. Then ALOT of time passed and still no food..... when someone else in our group checked in again, we were told they were still preparing it. It was a poke bowl. What is there to prepare??? I finally gave up and said never mind. They did offer a free dessert but were on it with charging for my cocktail. What is the most irritating thing is not once did a manager come by. I'm sure she was aware there was an issue, at least she should have been when the server asked to comp desert and remove the charge for my dinner."}
{"text":"Does not even deserve a star! Service sucks and the staff are unfriendly, unhelpful. Waste of time!!!!!"}
{"text":"People give stars on yelp way to easy.   Kabuki is what i find wrong with almost all \"mall style\" restaurants.   All decor no substance. We have been here a few time over the year and this was our last.  I was hoping it would get better since opening but i feel it is going south.  We sat at the sushi bar.  Drinks arrived with complimentary chilled edamame.  Not my favorite so we ordered Garlic edamame and baked mussels.  The edamame was oily and overly cooked. the baked mussels were bland at best.  We also had a spicy tuna roll and stopped there.  The tuna looked washed out, (super light pink in color).  It didn't really taste like anything??  Aside from the mediocre food is the sushi bar set up.  We sat near the center of the bar.  The sushi chefs put the menu items on the counter in front of them and the servers from the restaurant lean over the customers (ME) to pick up their order.  If I wanted to sit at the service bar I would have. I do not know why they can not have the waiters use the far end of the bar to pick up but i found it so annoying I almost stood up the last time to make a point. My wife and I felt in the way, so we promptly paid and left.  SO many better sushi places"}
{"text":"Happy hour is from 4pm (?) - 6pm. We got there at 5:30pm so we ordered just in time.  I like that this place serves happy hour throughout the entire restaurant and not just in the bar area like almost every other place.  We ordered 1 beer, 1 hot sake, 1 calamari, 1 seaweed salad, 2 philly rolls, and 2 dragon rolls.  All of that was way more than enough for 2 people and our bill came out to about $41. Oh, and they give you free edamame.  Not bad at all for a nice, trendy restaurant! I also like that the waiter comes around to your table and tells when the last call for happy hour is.  Wish more places were like that!     I'd do it again, but I just wish happy hour lasted just a little bit longer."}
{"text":"My fav spot for sushi. I'm a regular and tried just about everything. Very good food, and drinks are decent as well. Recommend the spicy tuna and philly roll."}
{"text":"We love Kabuki!  Great value for really good food.  It may not be as \"authentic\" as some of the smaller family-owned places, but we love it just the same.  The quality of the fish is excellent and the portions of the dishes are very good.  Some of our favorites are the pyramid roll, fried tofu, sesame chicken, the \"Ninja Deluxe\" lunch specials and their calamari.  This place is one of our family favorites!"}
{"text":"Lunch: Teriyaki Salmon & Chicken Teriyaki.  Usually I don't enjoy teriyaki very much due to its sweet flavor, and I was really planning on eating sushi, but changed my mind at the last minute.  I don't regret it!  The teriyaki flavor wasn't too sweet and the chicken was very tasty.  The miso soup, rice and salad were also very good.  The company was even better!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. A bit pricey for me, so I'm not able to go often, but some of the best sushi I've ever had. Service is always good, but sometimes a little slow as they're almost always busy. Have never had anything that tasted bad, and all the ingredients taste extremely fresh. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went on a busy Friday night, but we're seated immediately at the sushi bar. We figured out what sushi we wanted and passed it along to the chef.  at this point it had been about fifteen minutes before a sever dropped off water. We were about 3/4 of the way done eating before we were actually able to order drinks. We decided to get an order of mochi, which was a mistake. It was dry, powdery, flaky and unpleasant in every way. Will not be back, ever."}
{"text":"I know the sushi isn't super high end or spectacular...but every time I go here I feel so satisfied! It's got so many options, it's delicious and the waiters are really friendly. They pick really good staff who are always willing to answer my questions. Maybe it's just that the patio waiters are good....the one time I sat inside the server was a little impatient. I will definitely sit on the patio from now on! The view is great and it feels relaxing outside. Get the green tea ice cream- the best dessert ever!!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago, it is brand new and clean. We love the one in town square so i was happy one was opening by my house. Dinner was pretty good for them just opening a week before but i still feel the prices do not match what you get. The worse part was the food poisoning or bug that me & the bf had TWO weeks after this meal. I though the fish tasted extremely fishy and should have sent it back.. But overall, good service & nice location. Never eating here again tho."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I have never been interested in Sushi that is until I had Veg Sushis in Tel Aviv last November. From then on I have become a huge fan of the Sake, the horse radish and the sensational wasabi. Kabukki came recommended from my friends for its Veggie menu and i loved it. I ordered a tofu steak and a veg sushi with sake. Wow. Amazing it was. Will go back again. Service was excellent and being located in town square makes it top notch."}
{"text":"Kabuki is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas. Their ramen are phenomenal while sushi are always fresh. The staff are super friendly. This location is close to my house, so every time I walk around Tivoli, I always end up eating here."}
{"text":"My favorite place at Westgate.   Joe and Lei give great service.  Good food.  Decently priced."}
{"text":"A disappoinment!!  The quality of the tuna is not what it used to be.  Had to send mine back today."}
{"text":"It is a great Japanese restaurant, I remembered I ate sushi and safe food noodles there, it is so awesome. Also the foods are a lot, it is very worth for that price. Definitely need to recommend  for more people to taste."}
{"text":"Susana was an awesome waitress but eating area was way too hot. After asking about temperature, we found out west gate controls the temp, they need to be more generous in the summer time to accommodate the customers.  Thanks Susana"}
{"text":"My friend invited me out for Sushi this past Saturday night and I was excited as I love sushi but had never been to Kabuki and heard good things about it. Upon arrival, my friend was told it would be a 20 minute wait and that turned into 45 minutes.....no big deal but that was the first of a few issues we experienced that night. Shortly after we were seated, someone came over and asked \"who told you to sit here\"? She wasn't very nice about it but we told her the hostess  put us there (duh) and thought it was strange that they would assume we just took it upon ourselves to pick a table after waiting for so long. Supposedly the table was reserved but it was apparent that the hostess made a mistake, even though she insisted she sat us some place else (very odd). That issue was quickly resolved after I spoke with our waiter who apologized and said we could stay. The waiter was very helpful with the menu (there are so many options and everything looks delicious!) and seemed excited to help. Shortly after receiving our food, we witnessed someone get sick near the bathroom (about 5 feet away from our table). There was VOMIT all over the floor and the wall going into the bathroom. Not only could we see it from where we sat, but the smell was awful! I'm not sure what made this person sick but NONE of the staff members seemed to be in a hurry to clean it up. What type of restaurant staff would leave something like that to linger while people sitting nearby are trying to enjoy their meal? Finally after 15 to 20 minutes of shits and giggles, they cleaned it up. The waiter felt bad and got us 15% off the bill and free ice cream which was sweet but not enough, in my opinion. I could continue this rant but I'll stop here. I would have given this place more than 2 stars but some things are just unacceptable. The food was great and the waiter was cool but the fact that the staff would allow vomit to hang around, as you try to look away and hope you don't get sick from the stench, is utterly ridiculous. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Most of the staff is friendly. Beautiful decor/ambience inside. Mozzarella tempura is unique and delicious here."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation but they seated us pretty quickly. The service was good and fast but the sushi and sashimi were just fair in freshness and overall taste. Overall Kabuki is a good deal if you are on a budget but if you can spend more go to the strip were you can find better quality sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special the samurai last sunday to go. Upon pick up,  my daughter asked for extra tempura sauce which they gladly gave. My daughter planned on eating the tempura for dinner and the teriyaki on her break since she works nights. Upon opening the box, there was no tempura!  I immediately called them up and was asked to wait, it wasn\"t a short wait and almost gave up waiting. Then maybe the Supervisor or Manager was the one on the phone and I told him what the problem was. I told him the problem and he got some information and said he would call back. It is Tuesday today and still no call.  If I could give them a zero I would for Customer Service!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. Been coming for 6 yrs now and the food, service, and restaurants are consistent from the first one I went to in Glendale to California."}
{"text":"Kabuki is a chain so if you are familiar with any of its locations this one is just as good as the rest. The ambience is nice and the food is good can't really complain! The only thing I would like to see is their happy hour menu prices come down same thing with the regular menu I feel it's a tad bit expensive but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and fun Japanese style restaurant. My mother and I went on a Monday night after a movie. I can't remember our servers name but my mother and I sat outside and ordered a ton of sushi as well as a house salad. Unfortunately, we never received the salad. The server didn't even try to discount compensate it and we just took it to go after we finished our sushi because it came out so late. We tried one of the specialty orders of sushi and it was the BEST sushi I've ever tasted. I will go back again just to have it. Overall, a smooth and peaceful experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a date night. Food was amazing. Price was reasonable. Server was excellent. Only thing I didn't care for is the hallway to the rest room is a little disorienting ( reminded me of something from Alice in wonderland) will definitely be returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  Huy was fantastic!  My son and I had an amazing sushi meal.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 12 times and the sushi is always fresh. It is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for. Service is always great. If you haven't tried Kabuki yet, you need too"}
{"text":"this was actually a very nice place to grab some sushi. We were seated right away.  Server was very nice and attentive.  the menu look satisfying. however I could only comment on the Cali-roll and the veggie roll, both probably the best I've had.  I could couldn't try any of their sake, or other drinks, because I had forgotten my ID. (I look young for a 24 year old) the atmosphere was very active, and lively.  I would certainly return for more sushi in the future.  I don't know about price, because I didn't see the bill. lol  I'm spoiled. sorry"}
{"text":"The deal meal... their happy hour special hard to beat! On tap Sapporo, Asahi & Kirin drink specials.  We had the sweet potato fries, Brussels Sprouts, mixed tempura, soft tofu, spicy tuna, California & dynamite sushi rolls... everything was delish! Dinner was even better, I'll attach pics... Beef sukiyaki, teriyaki salmon & miso butterfish, again all with good flavor & generous portions. Oh, our waiter Justin, was on the ball!"}
{"text":"Great food great people a Little Loud but GOOD family time!   Must try the shrimp And beef tempura And the sea food soup  asparagus roll dee ;P"}
{"text":"My family enjoys the food and the atmosphere at Kabuki. Not a long wait either even though the place is huge. The best part is they have a selection of vegetarian choices for the non-meat eaters!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and selection. My husband and I split the calamari rings, Vegas roll, and the dynamite roll. The servings for happy hour are also great, they don't skimp out like a lot of other sushi happy hours."}
{"text":"Extremely solid restaurant, the prices are higher than I know most college students would want to pay but the service was impeccable and it covered any short comings brought along by the food. Obviously it lacks the personal feel you might get in a smaller setting because of its size and number of staff but that isn't something you can really complain about.  As far as the food goes, I have been there a few times with friends and we always get tons of sushi along with a dinner/lunch dish for each of us. I wont review their entree's because it would be unfair to base my experience off of a handful of them when there are so many. The sushi, tasted great for Arizona standards. I'm from Los Angeles/Seattle big cities with fresh seafood, but Kabuki had really good quality sushi. There are places in Phoenix where the sushi just tastes like its been pre-made or just old in general. At Kabuki Im sure the seafood is as fresh as it can be in a land locked state, but wow its really impressive. The flavors arent too overbearing and a specialty sushi dish can really introduce you to the flavors you would expect based off of its name, without drowning you in them as if though to prove a point that yes in face YOU ARE eating a Jalapeno Roll. (Made up roll, just using as example)  One last thing, try to stray away from soda and water here because the other drinks on the menu are really worth it, the Matcha Iced Milk Tea was absolutely fantastic as well as a few other drinks I had off their menu. Really give this place a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was even better. Great location overlooking the water feature at Westgate."}
{"text":"this is the most americanized japanese food ever.... terrible. how do you mess up sashimi? i mean its bad its just like rich white people japanese food.... go to Ichiza if you want legit good food FOR CHEAPER. this place is expensive and youre better off eating the garbage in the 'ASIAN FOODS' aisle at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, our waiter Mike is attentive to the customers! We had a lobster rolls, which is so good. I especially love the fried squid legs! My husband enjoys his unagi bowl! He's craving for unagi bowls for a long time! Strongly recommend y'all give this place a try if you're craving for Japanese food."}
{"text":"I have come here couple times. It was good before, I went there yesterday and ordered seafood udon again and found out no udon inside my bowl...Are you serious??"}
{"text":"love this place.  nothing really bad from and angle...good sushi, good prices, good service.  teh pitchers of beer are pricey though.  eel and avocada roll is the best around...and the lobter roll is to die for.  am here at least 2X per month... good value on their loyalty card too.  double points on monday and tuesday, so after spending $250 on those days, you get $25.  sweet!"}
{"text":"The food was decent.  Happy hour prices were very good!  The bar was very small and the batenders did their best to give good service.  I highly recommend ladies check out the bathroom!  It might give you vertigo!  The reason for only 3 stars: The hostess kept coming into the little area and SCREAMING out names on the waitlist.  She did it with such disgust.   I couldn't believe it!  SUPER RUDE!  I gave feedback to the manager.  I certainly hope they correct that process."}
{"text":"From the exterior of the restaurant, you see this upscale, hip, and contemporary sushi joint in the corner of the Tempe Marketplace. Yea, its nice, but it didn't seem like anything special. My experience was probably ruined by the fact that it was all just open space. By open space, I mean, there weren't any walls dividing the room's ambiance. It felt like a high school cafeteria, as far as noise went. The menu wasn't surprising as far as pricing went and the pricing was roughly $23 per person if you get water. Figuring, I'm supposed to be paying for all this \"ambiance\", I was disappointed. So, I decided, its the food that must supplement the value of the cost. Yea, I'd have to admit, the food was tasty, but so is most sushi from places like this. Nothing special here, which is why I can't rate it very high.  Food: Tasty, Normal Ambiance: Lame, felt like I was at a buffet (I said \"like\")  Other details: Hmm, we reserved a table, but when it came time to sit, we were given a table very tiny. The plates were so overly-sized, we had to laugh about it. I didn't mean to be rude to the waitress about mentioning the restaurants comparison to TGIF. This is reference to how they were singing birthday songs, as others in that class do. I come to a sushi joint to get a feel of authenticity of Japanese cuisine, not another americanized potential food-chain with expensive lighting."}
{"text":"Men... The spicy tuna was very \"hot\" instead of spicy, however great sushi and the chicken wings are very cheap and delisious"}
{"text":"Mom. Dad. Toddler. New Years Day (evening). Seated immediately. Toddler ordered the sesame chicken w/ fruit, brown rice and a mini veggie roll...he's gonna be a big guy. Mom/Dad ordered the ramen combo (off of the lunch menu...yes, they offer it for din din too!) I got the spicy tuna roll and she had the California roll. The food was incredible!! All of it! We ate the banana tempura for dessert and it was phenomenal!!! We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing here! We got seated right away. I love the location and the ambiance. I was happy to find that they have a separate vegan/vegetarian menu that made ordering my food a breeze. I ordered there veggie roll & avocado roll! I will be back to try more of there food on that vegan menu! So happy to have stumbled upon this gem."}
{"text":"I've been frequently this place and seemed promising with 4-5 stars before last week visit.  Foods were ok but very much unimpressed by a server whose attitude was so bad and rude. I might misunderstood a menu in detail, but he answered with a sneer that was almost impudent...Never had that happen before."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible take out order. Hot food was cold and cold food was moosh!  Do not advise Saturday night take out.   Also they told us 25-30 mins and we still had to wait another 20"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Place was clean. Food was excellent with large portions. I had the samurai lunch special, which was awesome. And they kept my iced tea glass full. A+"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and 8 out of 10 the food and service is generally good. I usually start off with shisito peppers since they're great here. They ave so many great options when it comes to the rolls and entree selections. Since its right by shopping and a movie theatre I will definitely return. You can also substitute the white rice for brown rice which prefer. For a dollar more you can have real, fresh wasabi. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"In the U.S. I would have to say, so far, this has been my favorite Sushi restaurant.  I have not tried the Hibachi but when it comes down to from Appetizers to soups, drinks, main course...Kabuki is the best!  Everything you eat is fresh, the restaurant ambiance is fantastic, the staff is on top of their game, and the servings match the price.  What else could you ask for?  Every place I go, I absolutely measure them up to this restaurant, I'm not kidding.  Perhaps in Japan the competition would be more fierce but here in Las Vegas, Kabuki is doing it right!  I've traveled all around the U.S. and the world and I have to say this is deservingly my favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"At best, this would be two stars, but woefully inconsistent.  The salmon was really good, the tuna was terrible and left uneaten.  I'm not a connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination, but bleh.  Overpriced, substandard, major fail."}
{"text":"Pretty cool design and atmosphere.   Service was friendly but uncoordinated.     Each item came at a different time.   My friend's shrimp cocktail came five minutes after his entree which was the second to last item to hit the table for our party of three.  They have a fairly generic drink menu, but I will say that it is very fairly priced for a Vegas restaurant.     Items ordered:  Tuna & Avocado cocktail - Good, served in a a half avocado, all though over salted.  Spicy Tuna Roll - Pretty good.  Gyoza - Very good, all though a little small.  Shrimp cocktail - served in a cool neon lit Champagne glass, the presentation was cool, but the actual shrimp had to be frozen.   Pretty bad quality.  We didn't finish it, and we are all fat guy big eaters.  Sashimi Plate - very good and well presented.  Beef & Chicken dinner - Good, but way overcooked  Spicy Udon Noodles with seafood - Excellent.  They made it a bit less spicy for me B/C I don't like food too hot.  Overall it wasn't that bad, but three stars for a couple paltry dishes and very uncoordinated, all though very friendly service."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi...and if I could eat this for every meal, I would! I usually go to the same places...but I decided to try some place new. Since I have heard great things about this place and I am in the area everyday, I decided to try Kabuki one day for lunch at the Tempe Marketpalce. I had been to their other location in Glendale before, and it was horrible service and their rolls fell apart with one touch. I give second chances though. So I ordered a couple different speciality roles that I have never had before at other sushi resturants. When my rolls came, I experienced the same thing I did at the other location...every roll I picked up fell apart! You can't eat sushi rolls when they fall apart as you try and put it in your mouth. Your plate is left with all the droppings and it really just takes the fun out of eating it. The service was ok, nothing special. They do have a rewards club called the Red Mask club where you earn points for every dollar you spent. I happened to go during a double point time so I earned more points for dining that day....but I highly doubt I will be back anytime soon to see the benefits of these points. I will stick with what I know until something else comes up!"}
{"text":"Great selection. Interesting sushi great service. Oysters were tiny but delicious and sushi was fresh. Something here for everyone."}
{"text":"Love the quality and freshness of the sushi here. The Kabuki Roll is a little tricky to handle but presentation and taste make it worth the effort. Don't miss out on side dishes like the cucumber salad, which makes a great refreshing appetizer. Beware if you sit at the sushi bar, the wait staff may reach over you and your food to pick up orders. Mention it to the staff and they'll hopefully be more careful."}
{"text":"Lame reservation policy- needs to be 4 hours ahead or you have to just show up. I think if you have the availability you should make the res. had a small party- now they lost the business- dumb"}
{"text":"Super busy and unhappy waiters   Food comes nothing like their pictures on the Manu. Nothing!"}
{"text":"Loved all the sushi, and the Fuji Saketini was yummy too. My seven year old daughter was amazed by the asymmetrical decor. It was a good for a girls sushi night."}
{"text":"Base on at least 10 Visits. *BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE*  We have officially giving up on this location after tonight. 11-22-16  My wife n I been here atleast 10X n only once we got good customer service. We r great tipper n don't understand what's going on with this place.   Maybe stuck up management or employees that just don't care but we've seen to much bad customer interactions that made us not want to come back.  Food is not bad but this location forgot about their priorities. We will not come back here.   Too many bad experiences to list but mostly just bad service specially at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"No Wi-Fi, your bill from the bar can't transfer to your table, and if at least half your party isn't there they can't give you the table you've reserved. =("}
{"text":"They spilled food on my husbands shoe then put a cone over it instead of cleaning it up. Then we received chipped dishes and they brought us our entree before our appetizer. Aweful experience never going back."}
{"text":"My favourite! Love the pork belly fried rice, salmon teriyaki and salad. Miso is amazing to. Really great quality of food, presentation and taste. Service is prob always a B-, but hey it's in Tempe Market place so what do you expect. overall the food is where it's at. Theres even a college discount if you are an ASU student!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable, we had 3 rolls and all of them  were fantastic. Nice music and our waiter Liam is great. We will be back thank you for a great lunch. The parking is close and a nice walk to the restaurant. If you are looking for great, this is the place."}
{"text":"Great sushi experience! The management all the way down to the food runners were extremely friendly. The sushi chef was very knowledgeable about what beers  compliment certain rolls. I am defiantly coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Kabuki is very traditional to Japanese Culinary. From the service to the plate sitting in front of you. As far as food quality. Food comes out fast and is cooked to your expectations. Although I do recommend double checking your order with your server because I've noticed they tend to try to mesmerize your order instead of writing it down. Overall this restaurant is a nice place to stop by."}
{"text":"I'm not a big shui fan, and wasn't really raised eating it a lot, so for a first time experiencing it I loved it. Reverse sushi hour is nice because my boyfriend works nights and gets off late. The only reason for the four stars it because I did find a hair in one of the rolls."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer here, but I never left any reviews before. I'm giving them 5 stars just because for the servers. couple weeks ago, I sat down at the sushi bar for the first time, the service from the sushi chef was awful. they speak in other language front of customers, they actually forgot one of my order for 30 min, but I don't think they care about it. I will never eat at sushi bar anymore, I'd rather wait for the table because server Angie and Jason always give us a great service. zero star for sushi bar but five stars for the servers and food"}
{"text":"Marvelous experience!   Went to Kabuki for the first time last night, I was alone and I sat at the sushi bar after having a terrible night. The staff was so friendly and helpful, they really brightened my night. They were so sweet and helpful. I ordered a salmon roll and a vegetable roll. I received my food quickly and it was presented beautifully. You can tell the cooks have a lot of passion by the way they present the food on the plate. I was very happy with my meal. It was yummy and very fresh.   My waitress was wonderful, I could tell she had many other people that she was waiting on, yet she still remained so graceful under pressure and she was on top of everything. I never had to go without anything. To sum it all up, I was VERY pleased with my experience and I will definitely return, probably sometime this week with my roommate :)   I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place."}
{"text":"An abomination. If you care at all about eating good (or just decent) Japanese food, stay away.   Here's the blow by blow: - shishito app - oily, sauced, and way to salty - agadashi tofu- the best dish they served my group. Passable.  - spicy tuna on crispy rice - a bad idea executed poorly.  - every roll we ordered - poorly assembled, messy looking, soggy to the palate - nigiri sushi - soggy seaweed across the board. A fundamental fail.   I was with a group. We were all dejected after our meal. All 10 of us.   Stay away until they decide to get their act together (if owners care)."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I have been coming to this place for over a year now. My favorites are: Alaskan roll and koshou beef."}
{"text":"Not to pleased with this visit.  We aren't sure if we will come back to this location.    To start we ordered the crispy rice app,  which never showed up and had to ask about at the end of our meal.  She said she was sorry and forgot to put the order in.    We also ordered the Lotus Roll, the first time we ate here it was our absolute favorite roll.  This time to our disappointment the lobster was under cooked and even a couple pieces were completely cold in the middle.   Next we ordered the seafood hibachi and asked if we may substitute the clams with more shrimp.  Which they said would not be a problem.  The menu pictured 6 shrimp on a skewer and they showed up with only 6 pieces.  I asked about the extra shrimp and she apologized and said she would be right back with it.  10 min later she came back and said it only comes with 4 and they added 2 more.  Then proceeded to change the subject quickly and ask my date about here hair color and advice on coloring hair.   It was just a poor experience overall.  Very disappointing for our 2nd visit and we don't really have interest in going back a third time.  Especially that location."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in years!!! Took 1/2 hour on a Monday night to get a table and it was not that busy. Once we actually sat down it took another 1/2 hour to get our drinks. When our food finally came it was mediocre, and that's being generous. The servers computer was directly behind our table and in the middle of our dinner a server dropped another customers credit card down in the side of our booth where it got stuck. We had to get up and stand around for 10 min while the servers and bus boys tried to fish out this credit card. No attempt was made to reseat us or accommodate us in anyway.   Once we were able to sit back down and finish our meal we received a half hearted apology and were offered free dessert. Which after sitting there for close to 3 hours, we were not very excited about. There are so many other good sushi places in Phoenix with better food and service. My suggestion skip this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kabuki at least a half dozen times. We've never had a bad experience. The sushi is fresh and there are many sashimi and roll choices. If you have a person in your party who dislikes sushi there are many options on the menu. My GF loves this place and she doesn't do sushi. The service has always been good to great. If you like unagi that dragon roll is loaded with eel. I order it every time.  The people giving this place a terrible review are either clueless on sushi, over critical prima donnas, or a pathetic combination of both. Sushi in the valley is hit or miss, Kabuki is as good as you'll find in Tempe, much better than the nightclub posing as a sushi joint on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"The Place: Hip Decor The Service: Not So Great The Food: Blah  Between the Food & Service... I'd have to say PASS!!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour for Las Vegas.  The lunch is also quite nice.  I have been dining here for over a year and I love it.  The decor is a departure from all of the strip mall sushi restaurants.  Waitstaff are on top of their game and the food is consistent. Most of the items are very good, as with most places one or two items will not be to your liking.  That is normal.  The presentation is always pleasing and the quality of food is as well. Sign up for their rewards program, the points add up fast!   One of my favorite dining spots....."}
{"text":"This place was not worth it to me. Food was adequate and the only thing it had going for it was the atmosphere. The architecture of the place was nice but, the service was lacking. I waited 10 minutes for water and well, lemon... we didn't get that until the end of the meal.  The price was reasonable so I guess bad service could be expected."}
{"text":"My rating for this restaurant is purely because of the server Lisa. She is outstanding and caring and goes up and beyond not only for me as a customer,  but for the restaurant.   She is understanding, knowledgeable and knows her job very well. She also remembers all of our likes and favorites. She is additionally kind and sweet and timely.   This restaurant is better because of her!  Congrats on having such a great customer service oriented server!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Kabuki tonight with friends. Had an awesome experience. Dillion was so knowledgeable about the menu and was able to remember our entire order to perfection without writing anything down...Impressive!! Annie, the manager, was so accommodating to our needs that we will come back again and again! Best date night spot!"}
{"text":"Tried Kabuki for the first time last week, during happy hour. First of all, they make the best mojito (Tokyo mojito) ever! Their sushi specials (between $5-7) were very creative and well presented. My wife and i enjoyed some agedashi tofu, Lotus on fire roll and Alaskan roll and all 3 were very tasty. Although the place seemd very busy, it did not feel crowded or rushed. Bill for 2 came to about $30 (2 drinks + 3 dishes). Will frequent this place again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a decent sushi. The fish is always fresh. The service is average and it is sometimes loud . Food is 7.5/10 Service is 6.5/10  decor is 7/10 with total 21/30 or 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"If you want mediocre sushi served to you by an incredibly unfriendly staff look no further that Kabuki in Tempe Marketplace. I have been to other location and this one must have a different owner. Service was bad, sushi was ok but not for the price. I keep going back hoping that last time was just a bad experience but it just is not a good place."}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm a sushi fanatic and LOVE this place. Everything is so flavourful and the portions are just right! I know that for sure, I'll become a regular here!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. If they did caricatures on the wall here I would probably qualify for one. I am here a lot.   I've eaten sushi at far more expensive places and had less quality food than what I always get at Kabuki. I typically go for the rolls here. (Lotus, Lotus on Fire, Dynamite) I don't like a lot of rice in my rolls and I prefer my rolls made from brown rice. And wouldn't you know it, this is not a problem for them! In fact its a regular way of having your rolls made. Nothing that they charge you extra for. And they don't pretend its overly difficult.   I eat a lot of business meals here and my clients are always happy. Even the ones that don't like seafood. (They make great teriyaki chicken and miso soup. Among other things.). So if you are looking for consistently good food at fair prices.. this is a great place."}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious... and the staff is attentive...  But the warm food was not good at ll.  I had some kind of tempura cheese and it was gross.  I should have known better than to order it in the first place.  I hear there is a good happy hour.  I might come back for that.  Otherwise, eh.  There are so many other (better) choices in the vicinity."}
{"text":"My all time favorite \"go to\" sushi place.  Full service bar with a fantastic happy hour. Bartenders are super nice and accommodating. Lunch specials are very reasonably priced with human portions. Dining area is so inviting. Perfect setting for  lunch meetings, first date or anniversary. Only wish they had a normal Sunday happy hour instead of  reverse happy hour. Dinner can be pricey but food is delicious."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience great vibe , food and presentation .. the patio is one of best on west side , very fair pricing for the quaility level ..  i highly recogmend you try it and i have tried the best the burbs offer"}
{"text":"great restaurant in Tempe marketplace! Always go there with my friend during happy hour!"}
{"text":"The Kabuki specialty roll is delish among others! Great service, food, family friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Was not the experience I was hoping for. My stomach is not happy. Fried calamari was to oily and the Yakisoba noodles where over cooked. I received the the wrong sushi and the United tasted off."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place. Great location and good food. Sushi is always fresh with beautiful presentation. Good kids selection as well."}
{"text":"The teriyaki was the bomb. And I ask for the dressing on the side of my salad. My date left her's on and hated it. The place was clean and romantic. So yah my date went we'll wink wink thanks guys. I am totally into Japanese food and this was like Japan."}
{"text":"Dragon roll pictured. Lots of eel, and made to look like a dragon. Overall the food taste and quality was excellent. Great staff."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit and the food was amazing! I'm currently decreasing my sugar and salt intake and my steamed rice and teriyaki salmon were perfect! The asparagus and shrimp tempura rolls were super delicious as well! I'll definitely be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing like taking your sis for her first wheelchair ride :( to go for my son's birthday dinner and having the staff and manager treat her like a 2nd class citizen and spoken to rudely. If you are physically impaired or disabled do NOT come here. The ONLY thing that made the night better was our server,  Linda!"}
{"text":"Welp Yelp!! So I thght this was the Best Sushi nd Service.NOPE second Time actually experiencing Bad Attitudes Slow Service Even When You Call Ahead For Pick Up.... Last Time Bout A Month Ago My Husband nd I Went for lunch. We made just before the Lunch Madness Began!!

{"text":"decent sushi for the price. great happy hour prices!!! sat at the bar and the bartender (Jeff?) was really sweet"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Ohio and a friend wanted to meet here for lunch. The food is Gross! Awful house salad and cheap ginger dressing. Sushi was bland the hibachi rice was tasteless. Will not be back-2 stars for good company"}
{"text":"Went with a some friends after work and we sat near the bar on the couches, it was a fun, casual atmosphere. Always love good sushi rolls! Although I love a good craft beer, I am not a big enough drinker to enjoy or tell about their Saki bombers- so I am sure I probably miss out on the full effect of the sushi happy hour experience!"}
{"text":"Kabuki solved the following problems... 1)  Our friends are a retired couple on a fixed income, always looking for the most bang for  the buck. 2)  Hubby hates to waste time eating.  (His words, not mine). 3)  I have nearly impossible dietary restrictions.     We went for Lunch with friends Liz & John to celebrate hubby's new gig.  Liz & John both got the \"Ninja Deluxe\", which they have gotten in the past & they agreed it was excellant as always.  We have found Kabuki to be CONSISTENT!!     Jim (hubby) got the Lunch sized  \"BBQ Beef\" & the Lunch sized \"Chicken Teriyaki\" with \"Brown Rice\" & \"Salad\". Hubby doesn't much like to eat, (he considers it a waste of time & has often said \"I wish I could run on batteries\" since eating takes him away from more interesting activities).  To my utter amazement, I heard Jim say \"Yum\"!!  If you knew my husband you would know how earth shattering this is!!     Now on the hard part\"...feeding me.  The reason?...I became a Vegetarian in 2001 & don't eat meat or seafood.  I have found Asian restaurants to be a HAVEN for Vegetarians like me.  HOWEVER, now I can't have anything made with Milk, due to chemotheraphy induced neuropathy in my hands and feet.  KABUKI to the rescue...they have FRESH FRUIT for Desert...so no whining about not being able to eat the green tea ice cream!!  As if this is NOT ENOUGH...as a result of complications from my cancer surgery, I can't have anything with Gluten in it.  SOLUTION:  Kabuki has Gluten Free Soy Sauce...be still my heart!! So I ordered the follwing: 1)  \"Fried Tofu\", ALWAYS DELISH, the breading is made with Rice Flour, so no Gluten issues here! 2)  \"Avocado Roll\", (I requested it made with Brown Rice). BONUS:  \"Edamame\" (one of my all time FAVES) is included...this dish was fresher than fresh and AWESOME!! 3)  \"Mushroom Miso Soup\", their Miso Soup is ALWAYS superb...but the addition of Enoki & Shaitake Mushrooms made it DEVINE!!   My Oncologist told me I should eat Miso Soup & so this was both tasty AND healthy!!  BONUS:  Brown Rice is an option at no additional cost AND you can order it on ANY Roll!!  We have always had good service & the Tivoli Village location is just BEAUTIFUL!  The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is they brought most of my food about 15 minutes BEFORE everyone elses.  I guess they did this because I ordered an Appetizer & a Soup, my Roll came with everyone else's food.  I suppose I could have told them this was my Meal & not to be served before everyone else's food, but they could have asked when I did not order an Entree...jus' sayin'.    All things considered...I will go back AGAIN & AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Hard to get to with the front door being on the second floor and surrounded by a lot of rif-raff. Still worth the trek."}
{"text":"So, I don't know why most people don't like this place?! Its good sushi, its not like it has real bad fish...the sushi is yummy, otherwise, the food there isn't as good. The atmosphere is kinda grim to be honest, not a lot of lighting, But overall, I would totally go back for some Vegas rolls!"}
{"text":"Good food, good sake, and good times. The good came fast and fresh. Ordered the California rolls and they were tasty."}
{"text":"I've stopped by quite a few times to eat while walking around Town Square. Each time I come here, the employees are always prepared to serve their customers, and there is a busy (in a good way) atmosphere.   The waiters always check by to ask if we're ready to order, and they're happy to write down any substitutions that will further improve our eating experience. The food arrives fairly quickly, and the presentations are always beautiful. Hot green tea (my personal favorite) is on the house (along with complimentary edamame).  All in all, Kabuki is a great restaurant that offers quick and friendly service along with delicious food. I definitely recommend it here after a nice stroll in Town Square. The sushi here is some of the best in town!"}
{"text":"Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh but Kabuki hit the big fail button! Maybe my darling co-worker as well for not checking the order before bringing it back. A co-worker and I wanted to try it out for lunch and since it's in close proximity of our workplace, we said let's go. We called in our order, I had ordered the Bar-B-Que rib and tempura combo and she ordred the Gold Rush Roll and Vegetable Roll. When she came back, hers looked amazing and mine, well, wasn't what I expected. It was SALMON! How the hell do you get salmon and bar-b-que rib mixed up. And also there wasn't any tempura sauce in the bag. Being pressed for time, I sat there and gagged down the dry salmon (teriyaki sauce did nothing for me) and tempura. If there was a survey tip in the \"Good for\" that said nothing, I would put my check mark there."}
{"text":"Good sushi, great pricing, very friendly service and very accommodating when we were in a hurry. Our server Dona was super nice and very  knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and reverse happy hour! The portion sizes are great and the signature dishes are fantastic!! The Lotus Roll (not on fire) is to die for. Even the kids meals are large and very well priced.  Nice open atmosphere and great service. Pricing is comparable to other sushi places, but cuts are above average!"}
{"text":"Our Japanese family goes here when we go to Vegas. The food is good and the prices are so much better than on the strip! We always have good meals here. Lunch is a great bargain. We stop here on the way in and again on the way leaving! We are so happy we discovered this place after paying ridiculous prices for mediocre Japanese and Chinese food on the strip."}
{"text":"They have great sushi and food. Service is always attentive and friendly. It can get very crowded at night and weekends. The happy hour and late night happy hour deals are super awesome too!"}
{"text":"Really good fresh rolls and great variety.  When near the stadium I love to come here."}
{"text":"Foods are good. Their ramen is kind of strange with the poke grilled separately? and the meats are blacken?   Yellow Tail was average, but everything else was good.  Lots of choices. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent.  Wonderful customer service and great food.  Jessie was our server and she was absolutly the nicest server I have met."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars but just barely, The sushi was just below average and the Over cooked skirt steak, that came with my fried noodles, tasted like propane. The server was the only reason I chose to give this place 3 stairs.  Get better cooks and pay your wait staff more."}
{"text":"For a busy night and a crowd from the job in arena we got seated very quickly. Our server was very attentive and brought us our drinks. We ordered the firecracker tuna appetizer (half off) and it's definitely one of my favorite things on the menu, our waiter also brought us out some edemame and I ordered a sake bomb which was reasonably priced. I ordered the geisha roll which was very refreshing.. it has tuna, salmon, krab(which isn't bad, people stop complaining..it's at every sushi joint),cucumber and Japanese mint!! My friend ordered the Vegas roll. I didn't try it, but every Vegas roll is good. Our waiter split the check and brought us the bill in a timely fashion. Overall, I will be coming back. They have a lot of Japanese snacks and foods that I enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is our groups second time and it has been a pleasure again. The waitress was great and the food was amazing as per usual. This is our work place hang out we come in and eat hang out and always have a great time. The place is busy in the evening but we were always visited by our waitress or someone from the staff. Only problem tonight was my friends couldn't get any sake because one of my co-workers ID was a verticle one and apparently they couldn't accept it. So we skipped the drinks altogether. Other than that it was a great night."}
{"text":"This place has some really good and cheap food.   As well, free soda refills.  I love it."}
{"text":"I enjoy this comforting place to eat at. Like the happy hour and bento boxes. Sad they got ride of the boats."}
{"text":"I have never been here on dine it, it has always been lunch to-go.  I come here and get lunch at least once a week. I love their food and sushi. It is always so fresh and delicious every time. The staff is always very friendly and well dressed."}
{"text":"Place is modern, and offered a good variety of options. The staff was friendly and had a good knowledge of the menu.   The food was cooked perfectly and was served in a timely manner. The prices were comparable to other restaurants in the area. If you like Asian cuisine I recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"This is by in large our family's most fav Japanese spot.  We popped in for dinner tonight & took advantage of their happy hour sushi specials that go from 3-6pm.  I ordered my usual, tempura udon and a cal roll.  It was delicious.  The noodles & broth were awesome, tempura came out crisp & fresh and the cal roll was bomb.  The udon comes w/ a house salad and seriously the dressing is so so delicious, I could drink a cup full!  My husband loves all their sushi and my son was just taking down their super succulent sesame chicken, total yum!!!  Its a perfect spot, they have a nice variety of delicious eats, prices are really good w/ excellent portion sizes and service is superb!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Kabuki and it did not disappoint. Amazing sushi, great drinks and really great service. Will definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I'm usually a regular at the Cerritos, CA location, but this locations beats out the CA location because they have REVERSE happy hour!  I've never been disappointed in any of the items I've ordered. Next time, try asking for a side of spicy ponzu sauce. The sushi tastes better with this than the soy sauce, in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's all too often u go into a Sushi place and it's owned by Korean, Chinese, or other Asian.  I find it encouraging when my wait staff is Japanese which seem to add some authenticity....  The service is very prompt and friendly.  The food is good with a little bit of modernized flare.  Small portions and fair priced.  A good pit stop place for the mall."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants.  The Dragon Roll is my favorite.  And happy hour makes it even better. This place is always busy. Great atmosphere and staff. The town square location is always great before or after a movie."}
{"text":"Sushi may be expensive, but the omega 3s you can get from fish are amazing for you. My brother in law and sister insisted taking us here to try some real sashimi after playing it safe with California and spicy tuna rolls for a few years. If you just pop those suckers in your mouth without worrying about the fishy flavor or texture, you can really taste the freshness! The edemame appetizers was nice, but they serve it cold and not warm."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch.  The food was spot on.  The waitress however seemed to forget to fill water glasses at all.  Even when I ordered dessert she failed to ask if we needed more water or any other beverages.  She seemed only too interested to close out our bill.   She took the extra step to grab the payment and that was even before dessert hit our table.  If I was to grade on food and presentation ... It would be 5 stars for BOH.  Instead the FOH made us feel unwelcome and as if we were a nuisance."}
{"text":"Orrchid and I were out for our periodic \"Someplace New\" event.  I guess that between my bad knee and her bad back, we've developed a fear of tatami rooms, so we've been avoiding Japanese restaurants.  Friday night, however, found us checking out Kabuki,  Orchid decided on beef teriyaki (combination plate), and I had the tonkatsu (pork) (also combination plate).  On the whole, well-executed, except for the fact that the pork tonkatsu reminded me of a plain American breaded pork chop.  Seasoned and prepared the way I would like a pork chop, but just wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  Orchid had Kabuki's version of fried ice cream for dessert, which she enjoyed.  The iced tea was quite well prepared, and the hot teal that we asked for with the meal was nice (but I wasn't expecting the large cups; I had rather thought we'd have one pot to share).  All in all, a nice \"something different.\"  We will be back.  - - - - -  On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: a delightful and respectable 85."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years for the fresh fish and Poke bowl.  It's rare to find a chain restaurant that delivers quality with freshness and at a good value.  My favorites are the sesame chicken, Philadelphia roll, and spicy tuna.  Perfect balance of fish to rice on their sushi and the happy hour prices are an awesome value.  Highly recommend for, quality, value and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Kabuki is a good restaurant because food is fresh and healthy. Services are good and friendly. I like this restaurant."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place while shopping in town square around christmas time with my boyfriend. Being from hawaii, I am definitely not used to the cold so I went in here looking for some soup or ramen. I found some and it was delicious. My boyfriend and I also tried one of those big boats (Can't remember what it was called but it was the larger of the two) Everything on the boat was delicious except the chicken. It had sort of a bitter burnt taste. Not sure if that's what they were going for and I'm not accustomed to it or they made a mistake. I did appreciate the speed of service we received though. Our waitress came by frequently to ask how we were doing and to refill our drinks. That was definitely nice since she was pretty busy. I've never had trouble finding parking for this place and never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a table. Very reasonable. One star off because, while it is a nice romantic setting, the lighting in there was way too dim to read the menu. I'm in my 20's and my eyesight is fine but I don't think it would hurt to turn the lights over the tables up a little bit."}
{"text":"I was extremely underwhelmed. The miso soup was the best part of my meal. The seaweed salad was mixed with other greens which was strange. The spicy tuna roll over crispy rice was assembled poorly, fell apart and loosely packed. The Tokyo seafood paella was bland, to say the least, with the curry having the texture of water. Plus three of the mussels weren't even cooked enough to open. I was not at all impressed with the food although the waitress was good."}
{"text":"Went here today because a friend recommend it. IT WAS HORRIBLE!! Sushi didn't taste fresh at all EXTREMELY FISHY AND HORRIBLE!!! We ordered iced tea and there wasn't even ice in our glasses. I asked for sugar and the server provided a sugar container that was close to empty with 2 sugar packets in it.  I was so upset with the food and the service that I refused to leave a tip. Do yourself a favor if you want fresh sushi and great service go to Sushi Fever on W. Sahara. I even addressed these issues with the manager and there were no adjustments of the bill. To be clear when I visit a great sushi bar or restaurant I am a huge tipper if it is earned. I have left over $20 tips at sushi bars previously for two people. This place needs to go out of business. I would have been more excited to throw my money in the garage than wasting it on this old seafood!!! Please save your time and money. I am editing this review because last night my husband and myself both had food poisoning due to this sushi place. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, as expected each time I visit Kabuki. My waitress, Alicen, was very attentive and understanding. She gave us recommendations from the menu and helped us decide on our meals based on our specific tastes. Overall, an outstanding evening, with superb service, unique atmosphere, and I look forward to the next time I dine in the establishment."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10PM when yelp & the front door said they closed at 10:30PM. I work in the industry so I understand this can be annoying but it's not like we walked in at 10:25... Our server Brandon was very nice and gracefully handled being forced by management to give last call for food before we had even received drinks. I've never been rushed through a meal like this before and we were still eating dinner when they cut the music and turned the lights on. Only reason for two stars and not one is Brandon. Good job buddy."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to go !!! The staff is fast and friendly, the food is fantastic. Have been here several times, some of my favorites are; soft shell crab appetizer ( comes on a sizzling plate with onions and ponzu sauce ) Koshou Beef and seafood hibachi are delicious. Save room for green tea ice cream ."}
{"text":"Their combo entrees are great! But you have a pretty nice selection to choose from, so theres bound to be something for everyone. Fun atmosphere and good service. To top it off, you get a discount if you show them your LVAC member card."}
{"text":"Awesome place. We had dynamite rolls, cilantro albacore rolls, and cucumber king crab wrap. My husband liked the cilantro rolls best and I liked the dynamite but it was close! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I love the picture menu...everything looks delicious and tastes even better! On father's day we were Going to a different restaurant and they had a 2 hour wait so we thought we would try it and we loved it... the dynamite is a must have!"}
{"text":"So this used to be me and my hubby's date night place but this place has changed! My order came out wrong twice I asked to talk to the manager and he was rude! We won't be coming back to this place!! Just go to Ojah up the street, they actually care about their customers!!"}
{"text":"I am going to be completely honest! If you are an EEL lover like I am, search no further! I have been to many of sushi spots in The Bay Area & Las Vegas and I had no idea the beauty that is the Dragon Roll could get any better than I thought it already was, but this place, it's like an orgy of flavors in your mouth. Flavorful and unspoiled by tempura as some Dragon Rolls are, this is truly a dream. Each time I have a craving, I reminisce my wonderful experience at Kabuki.    Service is good, went on a slow day, they made me my roy rogers and I was so incredibly satisfied!"}
{"text":"Hmm. The reviews seem to be all over place. My experience was very good. We arrived around 7pm. The place was really busy. We had to wait a bit for a table, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We decided to eat family style. We had a few different kinds of nigiri - albacore, salmon, spanish mackeral, etc... All were well portioned and tasted fresh. We completed the meal with a Lotus on Fire Roll and Hamachi Box Roll. The sauces that came with both of these rolls was excellent. A mix of sweet and spicy.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and I would return. Service was fast and friendly as well.   - Chris"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place! Or it was...  We love the food so much & sit at the bar. We always get the dynamite roll, avocado roll, cucumber roll, soup, & garden salad. Always on point with food! The service used to be amazing. We miss the blonde gentlemen that used to bartend. The last few times we have gone in, the staff seems miserable & the woman bar-tending isn't a happy camper. Service can make or break a place...get it together, Kabuki staff."}
{"text":"I have bin coming to kabuki since they opened we have great service the food is amazing,  they have great  waiters and waitresses. Huy and Linda always take care of us and our family,  I highly recommend this place you will not be disappointed. We always feel welcomed and no matter how busy they always come to check back on us at a reasonable time."}
{"text":"Sushi was good service was not. Even the three hostesses just sat at the front desk, chatting, giggling and flipping their hair (nonproductive). I dropped one chop stick on the floor and waited so long, I never even got another pair. My order did not come out complete which didn't matter because by the time we saw our server again we were ready to go with our one chop stick."}
{"text":"arrived late-ish on saturday night. we were told that \"last call\" was in a few minutes even though they were open for another half hour.  we were seated in the back corner, a table of 8 all the way up against a wall so i had to slide in four seat and feel like i was being punished. there was plenty of room that they could have given us an opening on both sides.  we ordered our foods and they were ok, pretty mediocre. the udon broth was very strong and the yakatori chicken was not very good. the spicy tuna roll was ok; it's clear this place is a chain.  the thing worth reviewing: they turned off the music, turned up the lights, and started putting chairs up on tables while we were still eating. we were not there much past closing, so it's not as if we were burdening the staff.  next time just tell us you can't seat us, because we would have gone somewhere else. actually, next time we will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Loved this place and spent way too much money here. The best thing about Kabuki is the Happy Hour pricing. Selected items are 30% to 50% off. You'll get decent sushi for decent prices, considering you're in Vegas.  As another reviewer noted, the tables seem to shrink rapidly. They will bring out a dish for everything you order and it gets crowded fast."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to restaurants and all of their items are so delicious. Every time I go, I try one new food and my regular dish of the Tokyo Seafood Paella. The service is great and the staff is all so friendly.   I would highly recommend this place if you like Japanese food or are looking to try something new. Their menu is super versatile so even the pickiest easters can find something they like."}
{"text":"Not worth it...  When I ordered an entree for $17, I was expecting something to be amazing. What I got was less than average, there was barely any food on my plate, the sushi looked amazing(pictures),  it tasted bad and was falling apart.   I probably would not go here again. I'll rather go to a local place."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night around 5:45 and it was busy already. Ordered waters, those came out fast as did the wine. We ordered the snow crab roll, spider roll and the Alaskan roll. The Alaskan roll was amazing. It was the perfect roll. The spider was good, I have better at other restaurants and the snow crab was just ok. The food came out in good time especially for how busy it was. Overall, we are happy with our visit. Only complaint was that we came in at happy hour and no one told us. That might have changed our order a bit. Nor a huge deal but something worth mentioning"}
{"text":"Their pickup service is pretty good and  fast. However, I've tried many better sushi rolls for the same price."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi I've had in a longtime. I got a rainbow roll, shrimp tempura roll and a California roll. I ordered pickup. Everything taste so fresh and great. This will be my go to place for sushi"}
{"text":"Took my Granddaughter here for dinner.  OMG What good food. The service was very good and we didn't have to wait long.  this is our new go to place. Prices are very good. We went during happy hour."}
{"text":"The service was nonexistent waited 15 plus minutes just to put a drink order in but don't worry the server was confused on if he was supposed to serve us.   The food was average at the best I would suggest RA sushi if you want chain food."}
{"text":"This place got me to like sushi! Their specialty rolls are INSANE, you can sit down at a table or order at the sushi bar. Two words: spicy tuna..... it's sooo good! Best part of Westgate by far."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar. The sushi was delicious! The service was slow, and the sushi chef was slammed. I also ordered a chicken and steak dinner which took a long time to receive, and it was cold like it was sitting a while before being delivered to my table. 4 stars because the sushi was awesome and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm not typically a sushi head but I did enjoy the food. I ordered a salmon roll and hibachi rice with chicken. I did appreciate that they offer a brown rice option so I was able to use it for both. Prices were decent too and the service was good as well. I don't really ever crave sushi but I'll definitely come back if someone brings up the idea. Had a good experience."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for excuses to stop by Kabuki, whether its a sit-down or to-go trip. I go to the Town Square and Tivoli Village locations and they always have great food and very nice service! I always have a great experience and leave happy. Their desert is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"The spicy miso ramen is my absolute favorite!!!! My mom got the chicken ramen and she liked it as well. We also got a California roll that we both enjoyed. Great happy hour deals from 3-6pm. David was our server and was very friendly and accommodating! I will be back soon for some more spicy ramen! I have dreams about that spicy ramen..... Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. The dragon roll is my favorite. The only thing need to improve is their service. The attitude is great and patient. But they do not have enough waiters! Take us 5 minutes to order and wait long time for the check"}
{"text":"My roommate and I were at Westgate, and jonesing for some sushi. I had been to Kabuki a couple of times before and enjoyed it, so we went on up!  We sat at the sushi bar, our favorite place to sit when we go out for sushi. There's just something about having a front row seat and seeing your food being prepared in such a meticulous way.   Our sushi chef was fun and friendly. He gave us our rolls in carefully measured increments, so that we weren't overwhelmed with plates and food. I appreciated that!   The food was delicious, I would highly recommend the AAA box sushi roll. It was a great combination of flavors. So tasty!  One of the better restaurants in Westgate, hands down."}
{"text":"Waited more than an hour for my food and left because I had to be somewhere else. The waitress had apparently forgotten about my food. No apologies from her at all."}
{"text":"Overall, the food and atmosphere, prices and experience are above average.  The only reason they didn't get a higher rating from me was the service.  From the hostess when we first arrived, to the waitress who attended to our table there seemed to be a kind of nonchalance about them that translates to \"you aren't important to me\".  I'm sure that isn't what Kabuki is trying to portray to their clientele, but nevertheless it is a common criticism among my friends and family who have dined there as well as mine and my partner.  Could use some training for their staff.  If there's an EVENT at the mall on the day you go, also be prepared to wait - and wait - for a table.  The management is not as well equipped to handle crowds as they might otherwise be.  I still go to Kabuki on a semi-regular basis, which speaks volumes since I am impatient with inept service \"professionals\"."}
{"text":"This was my first time, bartender was super friendly and helpful, and our meal was delicious!"}
{"text":"I Love this restaurant. It is so much fun to sit at the sushi bar. The food and ambiance is excellent!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night and there was a pretty good crowd.We sat at the sushi bar, the food and service were excellent! They have a great happy hour with very reasonable pricing.The staff is very attentive your glass is never empty. We will go again"}
{"text":"About their Dragon Roll: They use a very large unagi filet. Largest dragon roll I've ever seen. Very satisfying and so worth the $14 if you like eel."}
{"text":"Our 1st time here, on valentine's day and trying a japanese restaurant.  Hotess friendly and a short wait of 10min.       - they get your cell # so they can text you  when your table is ready, so you can wait at the bar or outside looking at the beautiful fountains.  We had the california rolls and the Combination  (Served with Soup, Salad and Rice) for  $15.95 CHICKEN TERIYAKI WITH SHRIMP & VEGETABLE TEMPURA. Everything was good.   Only problem we had was dirty chopsticks which was quickly replaced by our waitress.  Will be back interested in trying the boat."}
{"text":"Love it here amazing service, beautiful restaurant, perfect for a date or a casual night out with friends or family. Fav dish is crispy rice spicy tuna! But never had a bad dish come out! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"So instead of honoring reservations for February 14th, even though it was a mistake on your part, you decide to cancel them? This is bad customer service and I don't think I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"My 3rd time at Kabuki and they got it right! Food was on point and service was on point! Thank you Jessie, you were great! Happy hr is great value for the prices, mojito was refreshing and food was tasty!"}
{"text":"My friends and I go to Happy hour a few times a week. The service is fabulous and the sushi is some of the best I've ever had. You can't beat the prices either. Being located in Tivoli is a bonus. Gorgeous location. I have recommend Kabuki to anyone I know who loves sushi and we all agree its delicious."}
{"text":"I moved to the Phoenix area 3 days ago, but had eaten here once before about a year ago. I remembered how much I liked it so I decided to go again. The food and the manager, Huy, were fantastic! Loved so many of the Happy Hour sushis and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We come here almost every week! Love this place. It's not AYCE but it's not too expensive for a nice roll to have for lunch. A good selection of fresh fish and rolls. I like to get the kabuki roll because it is a roll with fresh fish at the top. Service is great. Sunny is our waitress and she is the sweetest."}
{"text":"Great food great service AWSOME atmosphere and even better energy weather your sitting inside or out this place has it going on. After finishing meal I ordered some Togo for the girlfriend got home to realize the order was completely wrong. Called them up and they handled it like pros comp'd two free rolls sushi ROLLS that is!"}
{"text":"Went here for their happy hour and I really enjoyed their chicken wings and sweet potato fries. Very nice environment. The bottles of sake in their bar area was a really nice touch. The presentation of the chicken wings was very nice although I feel like it might've been too much and they should really add more wings instead of wasting their money and time adding the little leaf thing (see picture). Their sweet potatoes fries were really good. It's only nice to come here if you're not too hungry but just want something light to snack on. If you're hungry, your bill will probably add up pretty quick. We tried their dynamite roll and it was just too rich that we ended up not finishing it. Server also accidentally put water in my mango lemonade when he was refilling it. If you're hungry but not too hungry, try this place. Otherwise, I would try an AYCE place instead like Goyemon."}
{"text":"I can't express how happy I have been with Kabuki!  The food is amazing!  Service is outstanding!  The location is a million dollar location!  Sushi doesn't get any better : )"}
{"text":"Food is great! However, service is hit or miss.. I've sat in the dining area, sushi bar, and lounge areas and I'm definitely sticking to the sushi bar or lounge. Don't even bother with dining. Every time service has been slow and/or unpleasant. Happy hour is also a must!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is very wonderful place for Japanese food. The food are fresh and delicious. However, I think the weight is not much of a dish and expensive. In the other hand, you can enjoy a excellent time with your friend in Kabuki because of the busy atmosphere and  beautiful environment."}
{"text":"This place has become a regular date night spot for me and my husband.  It has some of the best sushi I have ever tasted, by far my favorite dining location in Westgate.  For lunch and dinner they have a variety of sushi options cooked and uncooked along with a delicious selection of entrees and appetizers.  If you like lobster the Lotus Roll is a must try!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, reasonable beer prices, decent happy hour, and large portions for a sushi bar in a popular-locale.  I would recommend the place."}
{"text":"Can beat good food for a decent price.   If you are looking for value for money, this is your place.   Grilled asparagus were pretty tasty. The edamame was cold which wouldn't be my first choice of temperature, but was pretty decent. Teriyaki ribs were yummy and the AAA sushi was also really good.  My only 2 complains would be the edamame temperature and that the AAA sushi is constructed in a way that every single piece separates. They might want to wrap it up with sea weed or something to keep it in one piece, just saying.   Walking around Tempe Marketplace after lunch was also super pleasant.   Can go wrong with Kabuki.   Cheers"}
{"text":"So the first time I ate eat here I wasn't too impressed but I decided to give Kabuki another chance after eating it once before at the Tivoli Village location. This time I ate at the one at town square. First of all they don't have all you can eat sushi here which is absolutely ridiculous because if you get just two rolls it's the same price as all you can eat almost anywhere else. Second of all the sushi here sucks ass!!!! I got one roll (Alaskan Roll) and it was terrible ( Thought about throwing it at someone) Sushi is one of my favorite kinds of food and this place ruined it for me, even though I'll probably get some sushi pretty soon. The only reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because the atmosphere is nice and I met one of the most amazing and beautiful girls here so It was definitely a great  experience  but they need to step there game up and at least have all you can eat sushi to make up for the quality of the food. Love this place!!! Lmao"}
{"text":"My go-to happy hour hot spot, located south of the strip in Town Square. It's conveniently located next door to Yogurtland, so save room for dessert!   PROS: Location, happy hour, pricing, rewards program and ambiance. Another huge plus for me is the fact that they always have brown rice as an option. No matter where you live, it's easy to justify making a trip to Town Square. You can knock out your Sephora must-have purchases, explore the latest Apple technologies, grab a bite to eat with a friend and finish with your laser hair removal appointment, all in one trip. So after you stuff your face with savory sushi rolls, you can walk around and burn a few calories afterwards. #winning  CONS: Although they have a good happy hour, it's super convenient and not too expensive, I prefer \"I Love Sushi\" or \"Spicy Tuna\" in Henderson as far as taste and freshness. Also, they close at 10pm Sunday - Thursday and 10:30pm on Friday's & Saturday's, which might be a bummer for those who get late night sushi cravings.   HELPFUL TIP(S): Sign up for the reward card if you plan on being a regular sushi goer here. They will send you a free $15 digital gift card for your birthday month and $25 each time you reach 500 points (i.e. spend $500 dollars).   ~ Happy Hour Times ~ Mon - Thurs: 3pm - 6pm & 9pm - 10pm Fri: 3pm - 6pm Sat: N/A Sun: 8pm - 10pm"}
{"text":"Great place for kids...Good food. Good service. Not a chain fan, but this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I ordered the Poke bowl and my friends got various orders which included the tofu steak, veggie ramen. Everyone was very impressed with their order. The only issue I had was that we had to ask for silverware and condiments quite a few times before they brought them to our table. Additionally, my poke bowl did not come with all of the toppings that were listed on the menu. Otherwise, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Kudos for having Gluten-Free soy sauce and having a list of their Gluten-Free items... The food is quality and not expensive, while being in a great location.  I wish more tourists were aware of how amazing Town Square is... Although it may make it a little better for us locals to have a place to hang out!  :)"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here... but not anymore.  I would say many locals place is better than here.  I can't believe some of the AYCE place's quality is better than here.  I think thats enough said.."}
{"text":"Went there a few times. Sort of hit or miss. Miso soup was consistently good, as was the sushi (especially the salmon rolls, although these are admittedly kind of hard to screw up) and the beef short ribs were some of the best I've ever had. The Teriyaki chicken, however was kind of mess (very gristly) and the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Food was ok... Sushi was much better than the kitchen items.  Had to send the chicken plate back because it smelled very bad.  Dont sit at the bar as servers have to reach over you for other customers sushi orders.  Sorry Kabuki but for my first time here... ya dropped the ball."}
{"text":"I went there last night around 5:30pm and the food and service were awesome! We sat near the sushi bar area and we had seafood hibachi, sesame chicken and albacore crunch roll. All food was very tasty! I highly recommend the seafood hibachi. And after our meal, the waiter gave us a hot green tea for to-go. I eat here almost every month during my lunch break or for dinner and yesterday was the best service ever!"}
{"text":"When you're craving sushi, sometimes it's quantity over quality (that's what AYCE is all about). And sometimes it's price over quality. And that's what Kabuki is all about--at least for me.  Not to say their sushi is bad; it's just not the best I've ever had (hello, Osaka on Sahara). It's a little one-note and a little warmer than I like. But I was looking for sushi at happy hour prices, and Kabuki certainly fit the bill.  My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and split a pitcher of Sapporo (a steal at $13.95 for HH). We also ordered several rolls off the HH menu: Philadelphia and spicy tuna ($3.95 each), and Rose (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and avocado) and Alaskan (baked salmon on a California roll) ($7.95 each). It's nice that they show you the regular price vs. the HH price on the menu, because that let us know that we saved $14--plenty of cash to get an order of hamachi sushi ($4.75) off the regular menu.  Service was good and thoughtful. They gave us a free bowl of edamame, which was a plus, and the sushi chefs gave us an amuse-bouche of okra slathered in something that tasted like peanut butter. (Not sure what it was, but it was pretty tasty!)  There are other things on the menu if you're not in the mood for sushi, but if you are in the neighborhood and you're looking for a good HH sushi experience, Kabuki is a good call."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.  I have to say the fod was aazing and the staff was on point.  I would definitely recommend going here.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Tim our server was awesome! The food was delicious and the service was great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love their sushi. I usually don't eat out but this place sells good sushi. It's always packed so if you plan to go you should go early. It usually takes 30min to be seated on the weekend."}
{"text":"ridiculous! I will maybe never know how good or not Kabuki is.  First attempt to visit, arrived at 9:44.  The bartender was cleaning the floor and lookd up and told us she 'would be right with us' upon which time she walked away from the bar.  A few minutes later a man in a white hat/clothes came behind the bar and let us know that since 'they close at 10, they had already called last call'.  He left with little more to say and we were left stunned, hungry and way less than impressed with our first and probably last attempt to Kabuki."}
{"text":"Ok, but nothing Amazing. For some reason our beer glasses kept coming out warm, and it wasn't crazy full or anything. The sushi was pretty good, complicated names for some complicated looking sushi. The most interesting part was the hallway leading to the restrooms. The walls are all slanted to make you feel off balanced. I think I ran into the wall a couple times."}
{"text":"I had to stop going here, been there and loved it but, management totally reeks...... if it's not food from there you cant eat it there. I told the Mngr. my girl cant eat certain foods. So we bought her a happy meal , we are the ones that ate the sushi. Well any ways , what's funny is that the Mngr waited till we got the food and lecture us of bringing food from other places. I felt stupid, No class , No professionalism. I go to other sushi restaurants and they don't have any problem with bringing food from other places. Keep your happy birthday wishes and I threw my kabuki card away.. also cancelled your specials e-mail alerts..... Sayonara Kabuki..... oh please don't write back apologizing me ... thanks , but no thanks !!!   What's funny is that the people in charge answer back by thanking people that write the good things, not the ones that don't like service or are treated bad when they go to dine at their restaurants........."}
{"text":"I was very surprise with this place.  Granted I believe the sushi rolls are over-priced and there is no All You Can Eat but everything else that is not a sushi roll was decently priced and good!  I can't really say the price the food is what makes me a fan but the location and the atmosphere does.  I can maybe see myself meeting up with friends to grab some food here once a month.  But one of my friend's husband says the protion is huge during lunch so I will have to check it out during lunch! I had the Spicy Seafood Udon Noodle was what I ordered and it was also a large portion...I would definitely go back and check o lunch!"}
{"text":"Being next to the stadium in a high profile area, my expectations were pretty high. We had started out with the spicy tuna salad. It was spicy, but quite bland. I had the shrimp tempura roll. It wasn't bad, but not outstanding. I had also tried a bit of one of the lobster rolls. It was very creamy. As far as the service and atmosphere were concerned, it was excellent. However, I can honestly say that I've had better when it comes to the sushi. Perhaps it was because we went on a Monday night. I have nothing terrible to say about the place but I will probably not be back. Anyone who gives this place 5 stars has never had really good sushi in their lives."}
{"text":"I love this place, lots of pictures on the menu lol. I don't eat sushi but I love the spicy tune on rice patty, soo good I crave it all the time"}
{"text":"I've been to several Japanese Restaurants in the Valley, and This one is a favorite.  They make some really great food.  The only thing is that seems like lately... during the week or weekend.... there is always a wait to be seated.  Guess when you are serving great food, everybody wants to go all the time.   If you have not tried Kabuki...and Love Japanese food... You Should do yourself a favor and give it a try."}
{"text":"Great, attentive service. Happy hour is very economical. Sushi was made perfectly and tasty. Keeping this on our list of places to return to when we visit Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour, says my 19 year old. Starting em young!   This location is close enough to the strip, so visitors can have great food for off the strip prices. The best place to park is in the back by H&m, since it's right across. BTW.. Its really a great H&M but go before kabuki because you will be too full to try on that cute pair of pants.  If you are coming with someone who doesn't like sushi, there are plenty of other options. The sukiyaki is a good alternative and filling or the chicken fingers.   We really like the agedashi tofu here.  If tofu scares you, just try the agedashi. It's crispy on the outside and sits in a well seasoned broth. It's amazing.. Just try it.  You can't go wrong at this place especially at happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch. Sushi was tasty and fresh, but it was nothing out of the norm for Vegas sushi places. It was definitely some place I would come back to though. Service was friendly but I did feel a little rushed by them. Ambience inside was clean and on the trendy side. The style kept with the feel of Tivoli Village. All in all, a nice experience."}
{"text":"Am glad my hubby liked his sushi, as I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences ever here.  Our waitress was not exactly a firecracker, spoke very softly in a room full of loud bikers, and didn't seem in any hurry to help us.  I am not a fish fan, but dearly love shellfish, so the grilled shrimp risotto sounded quite nice. Hubby's sushi arrived and he started in on it and was making nummy noises! When my plate of shrimp and risotto was tossed (literally) in front of me, I was expecting to be doing the same. Put a shrimp in my mouth and it was stone cold in the middle. Thought maybe this was a fluke, so went for #2. Not only was it even colder, but it had a funny taste and a fairly dry, rubbery texture.  When the waitress returned, I asked if the shrimp was meant to be cold. She said no, and asked if I wanted her to get me another dish. I asked if the shrimp would be hot this time. She said yes, and took my dish. A few minutes later she returned with my original dish, risotto re-piled in the middle, with fresh greens and the remaining 5 shrimp from my first order.   Shrimp were now warm, but VERY dry, rubbery and had a funny taste to them. When she returned again, I told her that the shrimp tasted funny and hubby showed her how dry they were. He asked if the shrimp had been frozen and she said yes.   She returned a few minutes later to tell me that I was eating my meal incorrectly. Apparently, after 50 years, I am unable to dine in a restaurant without instruction! I was told that the shrimp were intentionally bland, because I was supposed to cut them up and stir them in with the flavorful risotto and sprouts. I advised her that the shrimp wasn't bland, it tasted funny, rubbery and dry. No response. No offer to get a different meal for me. Nothing. No adjustment was made to our check and my strongly worded letter to Kabuki will be for a full refund, no gift card, as I wouldn't be caught DEAD there again.."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way out of town. Food was amazing and they were responsive with Gluten Free needs. I tried the bloody mary made with sake and was not a fan but every dish we had was top notch."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here who are on vacation from Ontario. They have never had authentic Japanese food before and thought this would be the perfect place to break them in. Our server, Camren was very personable and helpful with explaining the extensive menu and recommended some excellent dishes like the tempura and seafood pasta which my parents and I enjoyed throughly. We were also recommended the Hot sake which was an excellent way to start the meal. For dessert our server recommended the deep fried ice cream which we had in green tea, it was monstrous but incredible. The decor and atmosphere is very modern, relaxing and authentic. Camren was attentive with checking up on us and available for any questions we had as well as some fun conversation. Overall the staff was very welcoming and personable and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very poor service today. I've always heard good things about Kabuki, but the service was terrible. It took forever to get drinks, which is even worse on 105 degree day in Vegas. I will say the lunch specials are tons of food, and tasted pretty good, however the crappy service killed it for me!"}
{"text":"Trevor was great and advise from him was excellent, the best part was the Green Tea Cheese Cake!!! Will return for that alone. My fiance enjoyed the Japanese Green Tea Latte."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner. I love sushi, but my boyfriend can't eat fish. Thankfully Kabuki has a vegetarian menu. Our server was very attentive and friendly, without being intrusive."}
{"text":"This is our \"GO TO\" spot for Japanese! My husband & I usually sit in a booth but we sat at the bar this time and our experience was phenomenal as usual. We usually order the same foods each visit and it's always on point!  We start with gyoza, at least 1 roll each and I Always have the soy ramen. Consistency is key and we are Never dissatisfied!  We are thankful to have this place right across the street from us!  Yaayyyy!"}
{"text":"6 of us ate here last night, which was my third time eating here.  We waited a bit for a table even though they weren't busy and then we were sat on the patio and had to move a big umbrella on a stand out of the way just so we could sit down.  Not a big deal, but a little weird.  The food is usually okay and I like that they now have a vegetarian menu.  All of our food came out at different times with one friend's dish coming out a few minutes after we order and one friend's coming out after most of us were halfway done.  All in all it was the same as usual, everything is just so-so."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot here in Tempe marketplace. I went here with my girl and we both enjoyed it. They had a nice variety of options in the menu and the sushi was fantastic. The service was really nice as well, even when sitting outside. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hit or miss lol.  Today I'd have to say I was not impressed.  I do like one particular chef there, but we didn't sit in his section at the sushi bar unfortunately.  I ordered the Kabuki Roll.  It's one of the rolls that I haven't had yet so I figured it was the signature one that they are proud of...  horrible.  The only fish of the roll was on the top, which looked appetizing.  BUT Inside was that crunchy filler type of stuff that almost taste like styrofoam and rice.  The seaweed salad was good, but never getting that roll again.  I was starving."}
{"text":"Kabuki is such a delicious restaurant.  Not only is the food very tasty but the service is great!! I'm looking forward to eating their Mediterranean Sea Bass. Yumbo!!"}
{"text":"I usually like this place but the wait for the food is absurd today and they are no where near crowded on a Saturday afternoon. We haven't even gotten our appetizer yet and they just put our sushi on the table with no ginger/wasabi. I'll update this review after our food finally arrives but I surely will not be coming back here anytime soon. I wonder if it's under different management, maybe??"}
{"text":"Kabuki, Kabuki... it is always a go to place for my friends and fam especially since we live out in the west valley. Although it's a corp establishment (I'm a huge fan of local eateries) it still has me coming back. I come here a lot, and it's not always my fave but it's always open and open later than most sushi places in the west valley. Many people complain about portion size, and they have made many changes since the new menu came out a couple of months ago. But I have to say the chefs are meticulous about taste and plating. If something isn't to your liking, then by all means send it back! I have had some issues ordering premium rolls that were very small in portion while other times the portions were very generous. I have noticed it depends on how busy the restaurant is. The place is clean and the service is always hit or miss. Sometimes it's amazing service and other times it's awful.   Anyways last night we sat at the sushi bar (after a 45 min wait) but it was a busy Friday night. Alfredo was our sushi chef and he def made us feel welcomed. He is so nice and personable. Some sushi chefs don't even acknowledge you there but he constantly asked us if we needed anything and how the food was. We had some premium rolls, the lotus on fire, hamachi salmon box, and rose roll. Wish they could make custom rolls but they do offer to have sides with your rolls (spicy sauces, jalapeño slices, lemon slices, tobiko etc) The sushi to my taste has always been good (it isn't the best) but it's a great place to go for happy hour and enjoy sushi with friends."}
{"text":"We came here and ordered to go because our other friends wanted pizza and we didn't feel like it. This place was pretty busy.  I ordered the large roll and the baked scallop on cali roll.  The hostess was really nice and even told me the large roll came with edamame (It doesnt say that on the menu). I thought both rolls were good.  I substituted imitation crab meat from the shrimp in the first roll. I thought the scallop in the second roll was overcooked and the onions undercooked (they were still pretty crunchy and had the raw onion taste that didnt go well with the roll).  My friend had a cali roll and the shrimp tempura roll. She said both were fine.  There was nothing spectacular about this place, but next time I go to Vegas (and if I'm in the area) I might give it another go (and dine in) to see if may be they just had an off day."}
{"text":"Meh, wasn't anything special. Friendly staff but boring food. Won't bother going back."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the Town Square location but now we frequent this location because we moved.   Our favs:::   allllllll the veggie sushi of course.......and other fav dishes we have are the garlic edamame, tofu steak entree, the stuffed shiitake mushrooms, the fried plum rice ball thing (can't remember what it's called).......everything is always yummy. Oh and the kale salad....amazing and the garlic cloves that come in it are sooo yummy.  Recently we took my sis and bro in law and we sat outside on the patio. Had wonderful service even though the bartender was very busy and took care of that area also.  We we order or meals always come out SUPER fast.   Consistent smiling service, consistent food, tons of vegan options...we love this place."}
{"text":"The pork ramen is out of this world.  You have to try it.  My favorite thing is the spicy tuna on crispy rice.    They sometimes have toro as well, which everyone knows is the best.  Probably my favorite sushi place in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for lunch. Price isn't that expensive either. Today I order the ninja deluxe. Here are the items it includes for only $12 bucks plus tax.   Beef teriyaki, shrimp and veggie tempura, 3 cali rolls, rice, soup, and a salad.   You get all this and food is amazing!! I only ate in once I usually get pick up because work is down the street. Lunch specials are cheap and food is great."}
{"text":"One of a few 5 star sushi joints for me (Usually sushi is good [fresh] or not good) - Got to get the Fire Cracker - AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the white rice, avocado rolls, and cucumber salad.  This place has the freshest avocado rolls I've ever had, and I try them in every city I visit.  I'd def stop here again."}
{"text":"Fish is fresh and the rice is good, but the spicy tuna isn't spicy and the overall flavor is underwhelming. If you're a picky sushi eater like myself, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in from Vegas to visit a friend, on my way back home to L.A.  Been to many sushi restaurants, and I must say, this is one of the better ones.  With the combination of ambiance, GREAT service, and quality of food, you can't go wrong.  Being the first time I was here, our super heroesque server Jade, made the dinner selections very easy.  She was stupendous.  Great food, GREAT service, will be back when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The K.I.S.S. Review:  Pros: -good quality grade SUSHI, the truest I've tasted in all the valley -portion size -good variety in happy hour & reverse happy hour menu -good ambiance and social scene -good location  Cons: -poor replicas of some \"Asian\" dishes (evident in the tonkatsu and Korean Kalbi) -price vs value   If you've heard that this place is expensive, you heard right. HOWEVER, you just need to know what to order and decide if it's worth it. My favorite rolls that I'm always willing to pay top dollar for are:  Lotus on Fire roll Lotus roll Volcano   I'm accustomed to sushi in HAWAII, and I've got to say their spicy tuna is on pay with the island. That being said, those are probably the only items on the menu that I splurge on, hence why those are the ONLY things I get when I go there. Soo yummy. Happy hour is the bomb."}
{"text":"Came here because the great italian restaurant beside it was too busy. MAJORLY overpriced, tiny portions, tasteless ramen... worse than instant noodles. Never returning here."}
{"text":"Love this place, but please teach your front girls to not be so rude. Called to ask a question just now and got hung up on! On my birthday. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!! Great food! Yakibuta (sizzling grilled porks) and Chilean Sea Bass are crazy awesome! One of the best Japanese restaurants in the valley"}
{"text":"I've been on a bit of a ramen kick since temperatures have dropped in the Valley.   Was in the Tempe Marketplace area and got a craving so decided to check out Kabuki for their Tonkotsu ramen specifically.   It was good! Maybe not the most authentic, but it hit the spot. I got two nice thick pieces of chashu which were tasty and filling - good thing because the ramen doesn't come with any other toppings, unfortunately. If they added an egg to this dish, it would definitely make it feel more complete as a ramen. The broth looked nice and milky with a decent flavor, and I thought the noodles were cooked well - good amount of spring and chew.  I've had sushi rolls here as well and maybe thats where Kabuki really shines but their ramen is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"I will give this place 3 stars because the service is always great, and I like the happy hour prices.  However, I have never, ever, ever been impressed with their sushi.  It tastes like the pre-made sushi you buy at the grocery store.  If you want good sushi, there are a million other places in Las Vegas.  This place just happens to have a good location at Town Sqaure.  'Tis a shame that their sushi chefs aren't any better (or maybe it's the ingredients they have to work with?).  Next time I would rather go to a place that's not exactly the closest location but that has better food.  I love my sushi, and I love it delicious - not stale and flavorless like here."}
{"text":"Good Japanese food at reasonable prices. The sushi is excellent and the service good. A nice place to have dinner with a group of friends or family."}
{"text":"Our server Bernard was magnificent! Alaskan roll, not so much.... the tea tastes like fish."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch. The food was fantastic the service was good. I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"I came here for date night on a last minute whim, and it was amaaaaazing. Seriously amazing.   We came during happy hour too, so we got half off on two of the rolls we ordered. It starts at 4, ends at 6, I believe.   Anyways, I ordered an entree: Teriyaki Chicken and it automatically comes with miso soup, rice and a salad. Big portions! I wasn't expecting so much food! The teriyaki was hot and deliciously juicy! I loved the salad and the rice was cooked to perfection. The miso soup wasn't memorable, I've had better but with everything else I got, it didn't matter.   I also got California rolls, which is one of the best Cali rolls I've ever had!!!   Honey bear got a Vegas roll, and he absolutely loved it!!!! He also ordered a Long Island ice tea, which he also enjoyed!  The staff is extremely friendly, though I don't remember our server's name! But he checked on us a couple of times, and made sure our drinks were full.   I love the feel of the place. We got seated in a very fun spot, facing the sushi makers! It has a very modern, edgy feel while still keeping a calm ambience.   I can't wait until I'm back in Vegas to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good ambiance. The sushi here was above average with decent size rolls and nigiri. I gave 4 stars because the price was very reasonable"}
{"text":"As many Las Vegans know, there are far too many sub-par, all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants in town. This place was a refreshing change. Good food, great decor, and it's located in one of the best Las Vegas malls - so go shopping before or after."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here for quite some time now and I believe that the quality of food is inconsistent.  We are a part of the red mask club and eat here at least two to four times a month, usually closer to four. We mostly eat tuna, salmon and yellow tail sashimi and lately it has had an over whelming \"fishy smell\" or the tuna was way to fatty.  I understand that there is a fatty tuna but that is not the kind we ask for and I also understand that some fish have a fish smells but they stronger as the fish begins to spoil. I had the spicy miso ramen which was very good, something I get often."}
{"text":"Definetly earns 5 stars!! Came here for my birthday today since kabuki been my favorite place since I lived in Los Angeles and I've gotta say I'm more than satisfied with the food and service at this location! If your looking for great tasty Japanese food  Come to kabuki!!! Their lunch hour prices are superb! Of course dinners a little bit more but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Thank you Arizona for providing me with some good sushi! It's a busy place since it's located in a huge shopping plaza but it was worth it. I was so pleased with the quality of fish, the flavor and texture of the rice and their prices are reasonable. Service was great...our sush took longer than the combo meal to come out but our server Jaime was visibly upset by this and so apologetic. No problem though because the food was worth the wait. Bonus points for the mango iced tea! Will definitely go back for our sushi fix when in AZ."}
{"text":"Never had a single problem here.  It is almost always busy but even so the wait list is fast moving.    The rolls may not be the most imaginative but they have not once disappointed.    Is this the greatest sushi joint ever? Perhaps not, is it the best in Phoenix ? Maybe not.  Is it reliable ? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Glendale, I am on the hunt for a great sushi spot.  Unfortunately, this wasn't it.  It was ok, but not great.    We ordered a few different dishes, not just sushi because the menu looked really appealing.  My husband decided to make his meal from the \"small plates\" section of the menu. I chose a specialty roll and something from small plates.  There was also a specials menu and we decided to try the jalapeno poppers, thinking it would come out like an appetizer ml. Well, my husband received both of his small plates well before the poppers or any of my items.  We weren't thrilled with that.  Oh, and both of his items were hot, so it's not a matter of cooking time.  Sitting outside with the misters was nice and service was decent except for the timing of the delivery of our orders, but the flavors were just ok and I wasn't wowed.  We'll probably try again as the menu did have a good variety, so maybe next time will be even better."}
{"text":"Kabuti Japanese Restaurant  I consider myself a Sushi Expert having eaten in the best bars in the country, especially the Pacific Northwest.     This place is huge, and I mean huge for a quality Sushi Bar. First upon walking in and seeing the size I assumed it would be 3 stars at best. Not so. Very good Sushi with a large creative menu. Service was good as was the Sushi choices at our table. Our selections came out much quicker than expected considering the complexity of making our particular orders."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before a concert.  Good service, yummy sushi.  They also gave us a free Cali roll for checking in on Yelp :)  Taking it down one star because you can't make a reservation on an event night... would have been nice!  Also, they needed to turn the AC up and the temp down!  It was so hot in there... gotta make adjustments with the AZ heat, Kabuki!  Other than that, great experience!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go to a shop at Tivoli so we decided to have a late lunch while we were there.  It was a stormy, windy Monday afternoon and the center was practically empty.  Our sales girl recommended Kabuki if we like Japanese.  My wife loves it so I thought, OK I'll go along.  At 2:30pm on this stormy day the place was almost empty.  We were greeted as if we were long time guests and our young server was very charming and attentive. My wife had the sake sampler and I had a Mai tai which was just the hit of sweetness I was looking for. We also had waters, which must be filtered as the water tasted fine. We started with the Edamame which was very tasty.  I ordered the Kabuki Lunch Special and my wife the Takoso sliced octopus appetizer and the Sashimi Salad.  Everything arrived promptly looked and tasted great.  My wife could not stop raving about the amount of fish in her salad and what a great deal it was. I loved every one of the options on my Kabuki Lunch special.  We finished by splitting a pot of coffee and the battered deep fried green tea ice cream.  Coffee tasted great, my wife loved the ice cream, but myself... not so much.  All in all a great meal and a very pleasant dining experience at very reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Restaurant is lovely,waitstaff is informed and friendly. The food was fantastic, tasty and fresh. Prices are fair for what you get."}
{"text":"This location...the service is always slower and usually kinda sloppy. But the food consistency here makes up for it!  Our favs:::   allllllll the veggie sushi of course the rainbow roll is my favorite  other fav dishes we have are the: garlic edamame tofu steak entree the stuffed shiitake mushrooms the fried plum rice ball thing   Their veggie ramen is surprisingly very flavorful. On chilly Vegas nights that's the kind of soup I want when dining out.  Oh and the kale salad....amazing and the garlic cloves that come in it are sooo yum.   Consistent food, decent service, tons of vegan options...we love this place.  We used to frequent this location but now we go to the Rampart/Tivioli location."}
{"text":"We will not be back.... We had a table of 4 . Two people were served after about  a 30 min wait. We waited an hour for our platter. When it arrived  the yellow fin was red and uneatable. In addition to that , the sashimi  pieces were not cut correctly and the sushi rolls were falling apart and in many cases we were AFRAID to eat them because of texture and smell. We asked for the manager and told her what happened . She did not apologize nor did she offer taking the platter off the bill.  THIS IS LAS VEGAS and we are about SERVICE and good food . We got neither . It was a great disappointment  to us and our guests .   There are way too many good dining venues to have to subject ourselves to Kabuki .... Please , Please dont waste your money ."}
{"text":"I loved Kabuki at Tempe Marketplace, but recently their service SUCKS. Most recently I went in for happy hour and it took about 20 minutes to get our food while people who say after us got their food first. At the time we got the check I told our waiter that we were there for happy hour and that our check did not reflect those prices and she said that because we got seated a few minutes before happy hour started (probably 5-10 minutes before) she had to charge us full price. We are regulars there for happy hour, the hostess even recognized us so there rationale was ridiculous.  For the past few times I gone there the service has been ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Kabuki's is a sushi restaurant. With that said they are about the same as any other with a slight advantage in flavors and atmosphere. See the happy hour menu if you are on a budget or wish to try something new!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and so is service. Barbecue beef ribs, miso cod, and sushi are all great. AC wasn't working last night so it was a bit uncomfortable but no one can forsee mechanical breakdowns, I'm sure this was an exception."}
{"text":"Kabuki: fun to say and to eat at. Since I'm on a student's budget, I prefer to come here during happy hour! Great prices for a wide selection of rolls.  My fave is probably the BSCR roll with baked scallops on top; so rich and tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Kabuki since 2012 and I have enjoyed sampling the menu.  Some of my favorites are the mozzarella rolls, the new Tokyo Quesadilla (try them before they're taken off the always changing menu), and mostly the sashimi.  They have a superb customer rewards program too, so take advantage of it."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review but we had a pretty paltry experience at Kabuki. We knew we wanted to try a new place for Sushi and instead of using Yelp reviews we used the convenience of Tempe Marketplace, big mistake. With all of the new Sushi places and good reviews on here I wish we wouldn't have wasted the time or money at Kabuki.   We sat at the bar and I wouldn't blame all of the bad experience on the bartender. There was one for the entire bar and for the entire restaurant (making all of the drinks for the servers as well). Therefore, it took a good 10 minutes of us sitting in front of him for him to ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered 3 items about 30 minutes into being there. After being there for about an hour we received one item that we ordered then 10 minutes later received one more and one that we didn't order. We said we would just eat it but instead they put in for our original order and stored the Sushi in a fridge under the bar (whomever orders that roll next is not going to get it rolled fresh).    The good thing was that it wasn't terribly expensive. $6-$10 for a roll and I think around $8 or $9 for a Sake Bomb. It just took us close to two hours to eat at the bar and the food wasn't really that amazing. I hate giving bad reviews, maybe I will change it to 3....no I will leave it at 2. If we ever stop in again and it is better I will definitely raise my star rating."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi, great selection of hibachi,sushi, and noodle dishes. Waitress was super helpful because I brought an \"annoying\" gluten free person ;) who can't eat meat either thy were so accommodating and even had a gluten free menu"}
{"text":"Kabuki never disappoints. I wish I still lived in AZ so I could go back but then again that could be a bad thing.  Their Lotus on Fire Roll is my absolute favorite and the flavor is right and fresh is fish. Service has been ok-nothing horrible but nothing memorable. I like this place for the location as well since it's in the middle of the Marketplace so you can get fro yo after, sit in the chairs right outside and lounge or shop."}
{"text":"Went down here with my best friend for reverse happy hour. We showed up maybe 45mins before close. We got seated and was told by the host that last sushi call would be at 945. No big deal. We got there early enough to be done before the time they would close. A person came and told us that our waitress was on break so he would take our drink order (who the hell goes on break even an hour before the restaurant was closing??). Thinking it wouldn't take long, we ordered our drinks and waited patiently. We didn't have our waitress come around to us till exactly 945. Yes. We waited that long to get service. After finally ordering, our rolls came out quick, which was nice...till I noticed that one of our orders never came. We asked the waitress about it and she told us she forgot and she would be right back. She leaves for a couple minutes and tells us she's sorry, but she forgot to enter in that order and the kitchen was closed. ARE U EFFING KIDDING ME?? I'm sorry, but I feel you should treat your last customers like your first customers. We didn't get any type sympathy comp or anything. She didn't even seem that apologetic. Needless to say, I left a pretty terrible tip in which I rarely ever do. To top it off, their sushi is pretty mediocre. I probably won't be returning to Kabuki. I will definitely stick to 808 Sushi."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner. We i ordered poke bowl. The serving is plenty. The food was okay. Staff are friendly and the atmosphere is good with kids."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. The rolls are a little on the unimaginative side and coming during HH only gets you a minimal discount, but they have a surprisingly extensive menu complete with vegan options. That said, I still only get sushi here- the salmon-asparagus roll is a favorite. The chirashi is a little basic, but the fish is fresh. The poke bowls are a better choice.   Bonus points for offering free brown rice substitution on all rolls. They also have gluten-free soy sauce available and a 10% LVAC members discount (dine-in only). When getting takeout, they usually throw in a cup of edamame."}
{"text":"I eat too much Japanese food don't I?  So Kabuki is a place that's a little bit on the fancy side of Japanese dining. I would even go as far as to say that it might be a little Americanized and more focused on how westerners like their Japanese cuisine.  It's not a bad thing, I just wouldn't consider it authentic Japanese by my own standards. That, however, is up to you to judge.. am i right?  The food is great! It may not be on par with some of the more authentic Japanese places that I've been to but it is definitely worth trying. I honestly have not tried anything on the menu that wasn't sushi so this review might be a little useless for those of you looking to find information on their entrees and such.  However, if you're curious about their sushi then I can tell you that it is indeed something worth coming to Kabuki for.  They are pretty creative and they've got some rolls that I haven't seen offered at other sushi places such as their 2 in 1 sushi roll, the Rose roll which pretty much takes a spicy tuna roll and a shrimp tempura roll and mushes it together to form one amazingly delicious roll that happens to be my favorite :) I've also seen something called the Baja Roll where they take pico de gallo and put shredded pieces of crab in it and take that and top off a spicy krab roll with it. Damn was it good.  If you're not rollin' in dough, then I suggest coming here during happy hour or reverse happy hour because most of the specialty rolls are about half off and they have a lot of good drinks for cheap too.  For tourists, Kabuki is located inside of a mall called Town Square which is at the end of the strip. I assume that most tourists stop by this mall sometime during their trip anyway so if you're ever at Town Square craving Japanese food, Kabuki is the spot."}
{"text":"~The Seaweed Salad..Yum! always a great atmosphere and good food...  really awesome happy hour"}
{"text":"Wonderful service , but the sushi was not good at all :( the salmon salad was awful :("}
{"text":"Service 4/5 - Lets start with the service. The service was decent. They checked on us on regular intervals. They were very polite and they asked to refill our drinks regularly.  Food 2/5 - I had ordered a tamago nigiri, beef carpaccio, one of their rolls, and stole some tempura off of a friend's boat. The rice on the roll felt underwhelming. The texture, and temperature of the rice didn't give me the impression of good craftsmanship. The flavor of the rice was okay. That being said, the sushi was okay. The beef carpaccio tasted pretty good. The texture didn't give me the impression of carpaccio though. Overall the food was okay for the price.  Drinks 5/5 - of the Drinks I wanted, the nigori sounded good and the calpico sounded fun, so I had both. Should have made it for happy hour because it seemed like it would have encouraged me to drink more. The drinks came chilled and they had a nice way of topping off my meal. Kudos to alcohol lol."}
{"text":"I went here last night to celebrate my mother's birthday with her and my fiancee. I've never been before and was quite impressed with the menu selection. I ended up getting the Unagi Bowl and asked that they hold the avocado. My mother ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and my fiancee got a Spicy Ramen bowl. When the food arrived we were less than impressed.   My bowl had the avocados in it that I had asked them to hold. It also took some spices to really make the dish taste better. My fiancee needed a combination of spices and hot sauce to make her ramen close to palatable. Her broth also looked watery and akin to chicken noodle soup. My mom enjoyed her dish, but it's disappointing that the most basic dish was the one they nailed. It's not a terribly expensive place, but for the price, I would have expected more.  There are tons of other places to go for good Japanese cuisine. I can't really recommend this place for anything out of the ordinary. For basic dishes, they are fine. But I probably won't return any time soon.  UPDATE 4/15: Zhen, the floor manager, reached out to me shortly after the review to invite us back to try Kabuki again. We went back today for lunch and the food was much better! I had the salmon teriyaki bowl lunch special and my fiancee got the Kabuki Deluxe lunch special. The presentation of the food was great and Zhen personally came by to ensure our orders were made to our liking.   This experience was far better than our original one and I would be happy to return at any time. Thank you Zhen for helping us out!"}
{"text":"Just walked out. Couldn't get anyone to seat us after walking by 4 times. It wasn't that busy so I can only assume that each wait person wanted the other to do the job. Either way it won't have my business"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places to go specially during happy hour, my favorite is the dynamite roll and Alaskan roll"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the sushi was the awesome service. Our waiter was Huy. Great experience."}
{"text":"Sadly I went for my birthday.  It turns out my birthday voucher /credit was no good on my special day.  Then I never received any refills on my ice tea.  To add insult to injury I got stuck with a bill that should of been comped  and the waitress forgot to return my credit card.  Over a month later managers never reached through my red mask rewards card,  called my credit card company to try to see if they could return my card to me.  Turns out when I needed it most it was stuck in their cash register for almost 2 months.  Terrible restaurant and experience,  please choose wisely before running into this mess like I did."}
{"text":"Today's services was just ok.  We ordered the following:  Dynamite Roll- this was gross.  Melted cheese on top of mayo asked imitation crab salad that day on top of Californian roll.  Very little flavor and very greasy.  Spicy tuna tempura roll- THEY fried it so long that it cooked the spicy tuna& made it dry. I asked them to remake it unfried and it was better.  There is no rice in it so it was all flavor but no spice.   Hamaki sake roll- this is a square roll. Which I thought would be good but it just feel apart.  Too much rice and not enough filling/meat. The sauce on the side was good though.   Fried tofu- awesome!! I LOVE this dish though this order the tofu could have been more firm.  Grilled asparagus- theses were just ok.  Seaweed salad- always good because you can't screw it up.  Wontons w/kale mustard & honey tofu dressing- wontons were good.  Kale mustard had great flavor. I could eat that with hummus & pita. The honey tofu would be good on fruit because it was very sweet and runny."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are great! They have so many choices of rolls and tons of entree choices at this location. It is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for :)"}
{"text":"so we wanted sushi and I had been wanting to check this place out, so we left cen pho and headed out to Tempe Market Place. We started out with the garlic edamame and the fried calamari. The edamame were great, but the calamari had waaaay too much batter on them, they were more like the calamari you get at an Italian American place than a japanese restaurant. I ordered this whole meal full of several different types of sashimi and half of a spicy tuna roll. My son ordered a california roll and a few shrimp tempura, wifey had the jumbo volcano and a philly roll. My plate was good, great selection of pretty legit fresh sashimi. My son wasn't a fan of his cali roll. The wife seemed to like the volcano and her roll. Overall, everything was pretty good. It wasn't knock my socks off good and a bit too commercial for my taste. The food was decent. Memorable? nope. Would I go back? If I was invited or with a group than probably, but I'm not sure I'd select it again on a whim. Overall, this place gets a Meh + from me"}
{"text":"The last time I visited Kabuki was at least 2 years ago. There are too many sushi and happy hour places in Vegas to venture out. I do agree with the other reviewer it's not as a happy hour price, but the service and the quality of food were good which made up for it. Thanks to Kelly, she definitely has people skills!   HH sushi ordered were Alaskan Roll, Asparagus Salmon, and Albacore Sushi tasted great. The portion of fish to rice was good. The Paradise Roll was tasty and I like the garnished sauce used (not a HH item). In fact, I love all the sushi sauces they used and that goes with the the calamari rings as well. The Tokyo Buns both had great flavors, but it would have been an excellent items if the buns were served warm. The slaw that came on the side I thought was fantastic! The Sake Sangria had too much ice and dissipated the flavor. This drink would have been great garnished with mint leaves.  This is my favorite Kabuki, located in the Tivoli Village. I like the patrons that dine here compare to the younger/tourist crowd at the Town Square location. There are great restaurants and shops in the vicinity. The short distance drive from home also makes this an ideal location."}
{"text":"Good not great. Solid.  Chirashi was good.  Edamame was good but could have given more. Would go again but not go out of my way"}
{"text":"The grilled yellow tail salmon here is out of this world! I have eaten here twice in last 8 weeks and the sushi is fresh. The miso soup is great. Everything I have tried has been delicious. The staff is fairly friendly. Looking forward to happy hour here in the near future."}
{"text":"Best sushi in phx!!! Staff is super friendly, great environment, excellent service. Dynamite roll is a must order- also Zhen the manager is awesome! You can tell he really cares about his customers. If you're ever in the area you've gotta come check this place out."}
{"text":"If you're a sushi connoisseur, DON'T GO HERE!!  Let me just start off by listing all of the cons about this place:  1) They are wayyy over-priced for what they're serving.  $10-15 for rolls and almost $5 for nigiri, are you kidding me??  I didn't pay that much for sushi places in Florida where they had a world-renowned sushi chef.   2) The service was horrible.  The waitress was nice enough but took her 15 minutes to bring our drinks we ordered (how hard is it to grab beer??), another 5 to bring the menus, and another 10 for water because she forgot.  Sushi took over half an hour - during which time we were never asked if we wanted another drink.  3) The happy hour sucks.  What kind of happy hour is just a few nigiri and plain rolls?  They had more alcohol on the happy deal than sushi.  The food itself could have been alright, if it weren't over-priced.  For the amount we paid, I'd have to call it mediocre.  The entire restaurant is setup more like a trendy bar than a good sushi place.  I don't ever plan on going back here, since I found something better in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I always go to kabuki on my birthday and am ever disappointed. I took my boyfriend here not too long ago and he was super impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Wow was I surprised, I usually do not write reviews but felt the need to let fellow visitors now about this place. Food is decent, service however is horrendous. In fact they charged me twice for the same meal! I called and spoke with the manager and she told me that they do not have a record of the second transaction. I have a print out of my bank statement with the unauthorized second transaction and the still will not provide a refund. Not only will I not be going back and telling all my family, friends and coworkers not to go to this place ( and just to let Kabuki know I am a well know member of the very large medical/nursing society here in Las Vegas) but I will also have to get an attorney involved to get my money back, this is extremely poor customer server!"}
{"text":"The food was great however the service was relatively slow. We went around 630 pm on a Tuesday. The timeliness of the food was attributed to the kitchen staff however some of my meal did not come out until we were already finished eating. Our waiter seemed in a rush as well, walking away right after bringing plates and not asking if we needed anything. We had to flag her down a couple of times. It was nice to sit on the patio. They have a variety of vegetarian rolls and meal options. Overall it was a good time."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place when Harry was bartending... happy hour changed and is no longer one of the best... the sushi portions are the only reason I even go anymore."}
{"text":"the sushi was so-so, but the service was slow and the prices were bad. they also were out of soy paper the day i was there which was a let down. there are plenty of other delicious sushi/japanese places in the valley. really no need to go here. also, they serve their edamame cold."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was amazing! This place have really nice decor, great place to relax and enjoy their food.   Came here on a date long time ago and just thought it was an overpriced sushi joint but I just recently went here with family and had a whole new experience.  Venture outside the sushi even though the sushi are very good! After tasting sushi from multiple restaurant, I gotta say the price of the sushi here is worth it :) 1 or 2 roll will get you full.   Other foods here are good too. Love their garlic edamame and seaweed salad. The sesame chicken is different but in a good way [: The yakisoba was okay and the seafood udon was unexpected cause you want an asian flavour but get a cajun instead. The soupy noodles were better though. Love the cha sui ramen and the spicy udon noodles.     Service was excellent! took forever to be seated but it was expected because we came in when the waiters were switching shifts but they didnt hover and came back periodically to make sure we got everything we need. We definitely will be back soon to try out other foods on their menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, had their boat, presentation was awesome and had plenty of food.  Been here for the sushi obviously, its a little spendy, but the location is really convenient, i have heard a few negative things about their sushi, but i always leave with a smile on my face afterwards.  The service is par as you would expect.   I'd give it a 3.8 if there was that rating, why, because of the price to service ratio, but i'll give it a 4 because i really enjoyed my sashimi last time."}
{"text":"Got the Vegas roll, California roll, crispy spicy tuna roll and veggie tempura.  Nothing to write home about.  Fish seemed decently fresh but the taste wasn't awesome.  Doesn't compete with RA."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place to go to if I want great quality sushi and aren't too shy to spend a little more money for it. I eat here a lot with my sister and we are always seated right away without any problems. Our server makes their first visit relatively fast and our orders usually come out in a very timely manner, if not faster than expected.   Of course the bang for your buck is less than if you were to eat at an AYCE sushi restaurant, but Kabuki still has the best quality salmon nigiri that I've found in Las Vegas so I still come back pretty frequently. Also their teriyaki salmon lunch special is a really good deal if you wanna save money and eat a smaller amount of sushi but still be full."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at Kabuki, our first time there. Our meal ranks among the most unusual and best we have ever had anywhere.   Beyond beautifully prepared and presented dishes, our server was Marisa, who made the meal extra special. She greeted us with a huge smile, like she was having great fun herself! She was extra helpful to us in navigating the multi-page menu and answering questions about the various dishes. We took advantage of her helpfulness and willingness to teach us about good combinations of dishes, helped by our arriving early before Marisa got busier with other tables to tend.   Among our amazing dishes were edamame in the pods, avocado roll, tofu sushi roll with wasabi sauce and fresh ginger slices to cleanse our pallets between bites, mountain carrots about the diameter of a No. 2 pencil, plump udon noodles also about the diameter of a No. 2 pencil in a delectable soup with steamed vegetables, and all accompanied by large cups of hot green tea with lemon. The meal was simply superb and sublime.   So thanks to Kabuki and especially to Marisa of their fine staff for making this stop near our new home in the desert so memorable!  After so many fine and unusual dishes, we were delighted to learn that our tab was a pleasant, affordable surprise.   We of course plan to return there in the future. Hats off to Kabuki and Marisa!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! It seems they have an endless array of rolls to choose from whether you're an advanced sushi lover or prefer the simplicity of a california roll. I think the smoked salmon cream cheese rolls is my new fav. The kids plates are absolutely amazing plated so beautifully. A great way to get your kids to eat healthy. I would recommend the eel sauce as tasty dipping sauce for your rolls. Our first trip here chef po gave us a complimentary dish which i was a little hesitant at first being it is a Japanese restaurant who knows what it could've been. The fried lobster roll with eel sauce was nothing short of a delicacy. My mouth waters just thinking about the food. It is reasonably priced and for singles or couples I would advise to sit at the chef's bar a very fun experience."}
{"text":"Wanted to come here for years. I finally did, and the sushi was blegh. There just wasn't much flavor. Good service though!"}
{"text":"One of the better Japanese places in town.  Food's good and the prices are reasonable.  Yama Sushi on Flaming-O is still my #1 go-to place."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night,.. best edamame appetizer,they saute it in the yummiest amount of garlic and spices...heaven :) next we ordered the sahimi platter... freshest we have ever had. The tuna, salmon, crab, and whitefish were tender and yummy.  The rolls are very large and served very festive. if you order any of there rolls each bite is bursting with flavor.. thank you kabuki :)"}
{"text":"Although its not all-can-eat like most of my favorite Japanese restaurants, I do love their original rolls. Gotta try the Lotus Roll, Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll and the Dynamite Roll. Bomb dot com.   And you can't forget about the bar. You have to eat there, especially when Jeff is Bartending. He's awesome and always gives his customers great service. And I've become one of his many regulars. All in all, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I LOVE KABUKI buttttt they neeeeed to bring back the chicken and steak steambuns!!!!!! That's the reason why I'm giving only one star. Because that was my favorite thing on the menu. Besides that, it's 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We decided to try something new as a group since we live in Scottsdale and never venture out to the West side. We were celebrating my birthday and went to Kabuki for drinks and food. We were thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food, from the spicy chicken dishes to the sushi to the poke bowls.  We had outstanding service and we're able to watch March madness too so everyone was happy. We look forward to going back since it was one of the best dining experiences we've had going out. I would highly recommend Kabuki in Glendale to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Kabuki but this place was just A-ok. Their sushi just seemed a bit off and they just didn't seem to come out as pretty. They do have a reverse happy hour, but no sushi like Salmon on this menu(sadness). Overall, if you do crave for sushi and sushi only, then this isn't a bad choice."}
{"text":"So we came in with a few minutes of happy hour left. We were seated right away and was informed that we would still be able to order off the happy hour menu.   Our waitress took a bit of time to actually getting back to us for our orders. They seem to be having a pretty busy Monday evening. So we ordered most of our items off the happy hour menu.   I was happy to see that our waitress got all our orders in correctly and she did honor the happy hour prices.   The kabuki staff at this location always has a smile on their faces. They had some ventilation issues going on but they kept their positive vibes alive. I love happy people and happy places.   Anyway, without these happy hr prices, kabuki can be quite pricey. So keep those HP prices on there.  Well. Westgate is close to the fambam home so Im sure Ill be back for those sushi cravings."}
{"text":"The gold rush, Vegas roll, Alaskan, are the rolls that keep me coming back! I am not a person who loves seafood, but I love Kabuki's sushi. Kubuki is the only place that I eat sushi at! The happy hour is mon-fri 3pm-6pm."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour. So the bill for 2 soups, gyoza, a nd 3 diff types of rolls was 40$. Not bad at all. Gyoza was good.had a diff sauce to it, but filling was with beef and veggies. The pyramid roll which had avocado, krab and raw tuna was also good except the sauce wasnt so ok. Tasted better with the soy sauce mixed with wasabi that i dipped it in. We also had the shrimp tempura roll. Didnt have any of that cuz im allergic. The highlight was the alaskan roll. A california roll with smoked salmon on top. Really good stuff."}
{"text":"OMG! Just found a maggot in my TO-GO side salad from the udon pasta. The food was good, as you can tell, I was enjoying it very much. Then a creature came crawling out. OMG. I puked all my food out instantly. I can't STAND MAGGOTS!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Friday Night. Seated right away. Kinda bummed we missed happy hour but that's alright! It's from 3-6 . When there is an event going on they don't offer happy hour. So keep that in mind if your off to football hockey or  anything. My husband craves the sushi. I am more of a land meat eater so I always get the teriyaki chicken. Our server Ly was very fast and very personable. This was the fastest service we've had. They have patio seating. Perfect for our Arizona weather. Pictured below is the chicken teriyaki dinner comes with me miso soup and a house salad with an amazing dressing I wish they sold it , it also comes with a bowl of rice. The rolls you see are a California roll , Vegas roll , Alaska roll. We always chose you guys for our sushi. They do have a reward program so ask for a card to sign up and start earning your points."}
{"text":"Came here for their happy hour on a Monday to save me some money all the while enjoy some Japanese food.  AMBIANCE: The place wasn't crowded at all and the only spots with other hungry people where the booths and sushi bar. My boyfriend and I took a booth as well. Really like that it wasn't crowded as it usually is.  FOOD: I ordered their fried calamari & spicy tuna roll. The boyfriend ordered a Vegas roll and a gold rush? I forgot, correct me if I'm wrong on that last one.  Fried calamari-Cooked just right, squid wasn't chewy or tough, but I would've wanted more lemon as I do like adding lemon juice to anything fried.The yellow tangy sauce was more to my liking than the sweet brown sauce but still good. Spicy tuna roll-the sesame seeds balanced the taste for me but I couldn't really taste the tuna, I tasted a lot of the spiciness Gold rush?-Personally I'm not a fan of fried sushi, but I gave it a try! This roll was oddly sweet, it wasn't to my liking however. Crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  Vegas roll-Actually kinda had the same taste as the Gold rush?, but minus the sweet flavor  SERVICE: The guy who served us was like a ninja! He'd be there asking us what we wanted to drink, next thing you know he's disappeared and five minutes later he'd be back with our drinks! Then he reappeared and took our orders. Service was quick only took about 10mins for all our orders to get to our table. yay! But once it came to refills and the check, our ninja server was nowhere to be found.  To sum it up this is a great place to eat and enjoy yourself. I recommend to come here during their happy hour if you want to save some cash and get some sushi."}
{"text":"Called to see if there was anything vegan.  The host chick straight said no.   I don't have a problem with that but the least you can do is check. Kabuki obviously does not care so I don't care to even try. We can totally go to Yardhouse and give them our business. Their better anyways.  Kabuki management, you are a restaurant you deal with tons of people with dietary issues. You are also corporate the least you can do is educate your managers and staff. What a shame"}
{"text":"Even though it is an Americanized chain restaurant, I really like Kabuki when I'm in the mood for sushi but don't want to venture too far.  The service is always fast and you usually get seated right away.  The menu is awesome in terms of variety - you'll even find some Japanese food that you wouldn't typically find, like ochazuke and onigiri (though these items are a bit expensive, I appreciate the fact that they are  offered at all). The drink menu does not leave you wanting, either.  The food is always good, though admittedly the fish is not the freshest I've had. Then again, I have come to expect that in Arizona.  The atmosphere is great too - good for catching up with a friend or in a big group."}
{"text":"Super fast service! Awesome fresh Sushi I checked in and got a coupon for free cali rolls!! Pretty slick marketing!!! : ) Definitely will be back, and checking in again!! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Kabuki for years now and it's one of our favorites places to go! Always great atmosphere and my kids love it too!  Huy, the manager, is always very attentive and willing to accommodate to any requests that we have! Service is always great! Susane and Jason are by far our favorites in there! They are amazing and always welcome us with big heart! Our kids love them! Thank you Kabuki team for always having the best service and food we could ask for! That's the reason we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I had to accompany my small children to the bathroom.  when I returned to my table it was reset and my two to go boxes with about half of our dinner inside was gone.  The manager said  \" sorry, you didn't tell us you're going to the bathroom\". manager refused to do anything about it until I demanded a sushi roll to go which he was very reluctant to do even though he threw out $20 worth of my food!  Why they couldn't put my food at the hostess stand for a few minutes in case I had left instead of tossing it directly into the trashcan is beyond me."}
{"text":"The reason why Im in love with this restaurant because of their Soy Ramen soup. lol Its great food with great service, Justin is one of the best servers there, he seems to be a very kind person."}
{"text":"I came here before my high school reunion we got three rolls they weren't that bad I know we got the rose roll and I'm not too sure what the other two rolls were. But I do have to say I did enjoy the place it was very busy and they definitely had a variety of rolls."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The Alaskan rolls are so good. Ask for Andrew for a great device experience."}
{"text":"Recently went to dinner here on the weekend.  Staff was attentive and our party of 4 got seated quickly (for being a Sat night near a Mall).  The ambiance is cool - relaxed, dark lit, a tiny bit trendy (but by no means stuffy or overly trendy).  Our meals arrived as expected.  I would say that the meal was tasty but fairly standard.  My mixed drinks (mojitos) were a bit on the overly-sweet side so I stopped at 2 (probably best anyway, right?).  The one roll that stood out to me was the 'Geisha' roll - it was pretty damn tasty and stays in my mind.  Everything else was OK."}
{"text":"Last Tuesday I went with my family at 9:30 pm, when we got there a young man told us that it was alrady closed without even greeting us. I told him that it was past 9 pm and he told me that it didn't matter. I felt he was being so rude with us. I'm really offended because we were clients from several years now. We've gotten there 20 minutes before 10 pm and there has been no problem. I don't like at all  that you man. It's a pitty you have such bad service in a place that my family and I really enjoy."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour here! It's a great deal! While not the best sushi I've ever had, the cuts are thick, well made and the fish is high quality. They provide complimentary edamame, which is also a nice touch. I loved the spicy miso ramen! This will be my go to when I go back! But my major disappointment was that I left my leftovers at the table! Nooooooo!!! Guess I'll just have to go back and get more.       The service was fantastic. Brandon was offered good suggestions, never rushed us, and was very attentive. He made sure we knew that happy hour was ending and gave us one last chance to order off the happy hour menu.   There are three sections to Kabuki; the sushi bar, the sake room and the main dining room. We sat in the main dining room which is well appointed that provides a nice environment and ambiance.   And finally, they have a rewards program! Monday's and Tuesday's are double points. There are also specials for your birthday!   If you're craving sushi before your movie, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great veggie sushi place. Had the spicy tofu roll, and rainbow roll. It's so nice to have a place to go with friends and not have to fuss with the chef over having little to no options for allergies/vegan/vegetarians kudos!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is my go-to for a special lunch at work. Their fish is always fresh, and the premium wasabi($1.50?) is absolutely addicting! I got the spicy tuna salad a few weeks back and I was impressed with the variety of ingredients in the salad; lots of textures with every bite an adventure. Their chirashi sashimi platter was wonderful, as well. HUGE portions--I couldn't even finish all of the rice--and it comes with a perfectly portioned side salad. Very filling, all in all. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it. I only wish they had more of a sense of urgency when dealing with to-go orders that were placed well ahead of time."}
{"text":"a little bit fancy and pricey but other than that this place has good service and good food. however they are very busy in the weekend."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great but the best part was being taken care of by the wait staff. Micah the manager is one of the best. She is one of the main reasons why I keep coming back to kabuki's. Friendly face always with a smile & an attitude you can't help but like. Wonderful place"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi...other food not so much. I've been here many times and only eat their sushi after I tried a really gross noodle dish a different time.  Sushi is very well done and tastes great. I love the Asparagus garlic salmon crunch roll and the Sunkist roll (little spicy). Tried the garlic edemame...will probably just stick with the steamed kind. The garlic was kind of greasy. Also there's sushi happy hour during the week so look for that. Clean, comfortable, and great staff. Dress is causal or dressy."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable. Good food and service. Can be loud sometimes. Not very appealing happy hour menu and the happy hour menu is way off. I always order a lot and take home leftovers bc they are good even the next day."}
{"text":"Great place to fill my teriyaki and sushi cravings and super close to home. Bento box lunch specials are the best deal and only ranges from $9-$13. Oh, and get the pyramid rolls!"}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, isn't too loud, wonderful food and decor. Our waiter, Steve was so kind and extremely persistent to make sure we were always good to go on everything. Quick in and out."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times ahve been great. The sushi has been fresh and tasty! The service was great both time as well. The price is a little high but on par with some of the other sushi locations around the valley. I thought they had a great selection of sushi and sashimi. The vegas roll and phili roll are both fantastic. The first time I went the person I was with didn't know much about sushi and the server took the time to explain and recommend some of the rolls which was very nice."}
{"text":"Food was okay (apart from the pork I received that was 50% bone). They made a substitution for me, which I appreciated, but it took sooooooo long to leave.   Can you please split the check! \"It's going to be a while.\"   \"Do you have another form of payment? I have to enter this manually and it's going to be a while.\"   My friend and I had 30 minutes left before she went to work, and we were planning a nice walk around Tempe Marketplace. By the time we FINALLY cashed out, she had to go.   2 stars for my time. And why was there so much bone?! Sorry to dwell, but I felt like I was eating miniature chicken wings."}
{"text":"\"Kabuki is a great Japanese foods restaurant\". I thought that when I first time to eat Japanese Restaurant with my Chinese friends. That time also was my first time to eat Asia's restaurant in American. I ordered the spicy miso noodle and the sushi of dragon roll. I loved the Kabuki when I ate the dragon roll, because I never ate the ell sushi has the whole ell on it and the ell was very softy. About water, I ordered the green ice tea, but I didn't think green ice tea was well at all, because that was too sweet for me. In my other hand, I think cook traditional Japanese foods need to put lots of miso; but when I did not taste too miso in spicy miso noodle, I still thought that was delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"\"Irasshaimase!\"  Been to the one in Town Square, and I like them both equally. I love visiting with my hubby because I get to choose what were eating and he has no objection! One day I'm gonna slip in some weird stuff, lol We had the gyoza, lotus roll, and spicy tuna roll. and cold green tea. No sake this time. Prices are not bad, all that was enough to fill us up. I can't wait to return for happy hour! Also, i really want to try the miso soup and green tea mochi. I know they are basically the same at all places, but I still love!  !DOMO ARIGATO!!"}
{"text":"What a gem in the desert, great flavours and solid service. Knowledgeable and friendly staff, wish we found this place at the beginning of our vacation, we would have been here everyday just to try more of the menu. Very affordable for quality food! Great shopping surrounding the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"One of the best out here, always fresh and served promptly. Sit at either bar and feel like your in another part of the world for a little while. I like it."}
{"text":"Kabuki is a great place to eat Japanese food. I love the convenience of their location. Pricing is excellent and the quality of food is really good."}
{"text":"In beautiful surroundings with a menu of everything you can think of. My only complaint is the rice does not hold together and the nigiri does not make it to the mouth.   Maybe they are having a bad rice night. Everything else is very well prepared."}
{"text":"I truly can't believe that Kabuki can have bad reviews.  I have been coming to Kabuki for 3 years now and have never once had a bad experience.   My husband and I live in Colorado now, and we miss Kabuki so much! No one can beat their sushi!  We used to come here 2-3 per month. We always had excellent service and food was always perfect.   Their prices are great in my opinion. We tried RA Sushi one time, got less sushi than we did at Kabuki, and paid almost twice as much. Their sushi was a lot smaller too. You get great portions here at Kabuki!  Try the spicy tuna crunch and baja roll. It is to die for.   So don't listen to these negative reviews. This place is magnificent! My husband and I actually wanted to open a franchise in Colorado, but they don't allow them :'("}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at Kabuki, their service is fast and Town Square is always a vacation. Visited this great restaurant about 20 times. Simply perfect - try their Seafood Udon Noodle Pasta! Have fun!"}
{"text":"Keeping this one as simple as possible.   I have been to Kabuki twice now with a friend of mine and we have always enjoyed the food. Both times we have sat at the sushi bar so service is really a non-issue since we deal with the sushi chef directly.  At Town Square in Las Vegas, so if you are looking to eat sushi in between the shopping, this will be a good place for you."}
{"text":"Went there Wednesday night and had a gratifying experience. Linda was sooooo wonderful!!! She was able to make our request of deep fried Gyoza and lobster dynamite the way of the old menu... Ur the best Linda!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is not something I do often, because of the price, but I happened to be at Town Square to enjoy a lunch break with my hubby and we decided to stop here!  Our bill actually wasn't bad-we were served for free an appetizer of edamame (sat at the sushi bar), and they took our drink order right away.  I ordered a spider roll, rainbow roll, and miso soup and left stuffed. Quality of all was AMAZING! Just sad I wasn't there for happy hour. I would like to try other things like the sake selection and if they have it, green tea ice cream...and of course other sushi!  Best place I've been to so far."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Kabuki for maybe a year, and wasn't particularly thrilled at the prospect of hitting it up for happy hour this afternoon.  I was pleasantly surprised - everything was better than I remembered it, from the service, to the prices, to the food.  Time to bump up the star rating and start encouraging friends to pay it a visit before movies at the Harkins at the other end of the mall.  I'm now a fan!"}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant,  here almost every week and we have the kabuki card. Whoever the host is who sat us, I feel so disappointed! She never told the server that we were there. We waited for a very long time, first time to be treated like this. The server was very apologetic, I wish I got the name of the girl who sat us down. I was hungry, almost got into a fight with my husband coz I said I was going to ask why nobody asked for our orders yet, he didn't want me to ask and just wait, turned out the server didn't know."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner just my daughter and me. Usually waiters tend to pull away from tables with kids but the waiter I think names Irvin was so pleasant and attentive. I was very impressed. Food was great as always."}
{"text":"So true story: I am meeting four friends for happy hour at Kabuki before we head to the screening of Paper Heart with the free passes we won from Yelp.  I had never been there & the average on Yelp was 3 stars, but we needed to head to a place at Tempe Marketplace so I gave it a shot.  I arrived 1st and was waiting for friends to show up. I asked if they had any vodka drinks on hh special or well drink specials. The guy said they only had beer & Saki on special for hh. Being the twitter addict that I am, I tweeted that there was no vodka on their hh specials which was lame, especially since I am allergic to yeast & don't care for saki.  A manager came up to me a little while later & asked if I was Julia. I said I was & he apologized that there was no vodka on the hh menu, but that he'd like to make up for it by giving me a free appetizer. Then he was like, \"You are Julia right? Cause I couldn't see your eyes.\" I wasn't sure what he meant at the time, but then I realized he read my tweet & found me from my picture on twitter where my eyes aren't showing. Crazy.  I tried to get a veggie appetizer, but he suggested I get the lobster one, so I went with it.  The whole thing was crazy, but really awesome. This restaurant actually saw a customer tweet a complaint, found that customer, and offered something to make the experience better.  So awesome job Kabuki, and oh yeah pretty decent sushi & service as well.  Give them a try and follow them on twitter @KabukiCorporate"}
{"text":"We almost did not go because the the bad reviews.  However, I mentioned that I had been thinking of going to this place to my cousin and he said, he went and LOVED IT.   I think more people yelp when they have a bad experience then when they have a good one which skews the numbers.  Therefore, I decided to take the time to write a positive review!!!  So we decided to try this restaurant on opening night of the 2013 Coyotes hockey season.   It was great, everything was fresh and tasty.  The prices were even reasonable.    The sashimi salad was so good and had more sashimi than most sashimi plates that cost twice as much.     The scallop appetizer was also great as it has sauce similar to the egg yolk sauce you get at Japanese steak houses.    I also had a rainbow roll which was outstanding."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled by the quality of Japan's fish when I studied aboard there, but Kabuki's sushi quality is ok when compared to Japan or even any other sushi restaurant in America. I ordered Taro and it did NOT taste fresh and it tasted as if it were defrosted by a microwave. YUCK. I was disappointed in the rolls I purchased; they were rolled too loosely and fell apart! :( Too expensive for the quality you get. Happy hour is cool. The cocktails aren't anything special....(tastes as if they're made with the cheapest sake/soju, bottom shelf liquor...)  Oh yeah, and their soups...well the broth tastes as if it's been premade by some mix rather than by fresh meats. It's nothing better than top-ramen.   Lastly, I must say, their wait staff mainly consists of the typical non-japanese asians for an Americanize Japanese restaurant....I believe there is 1 or 2 people that were of Japanese decent. The manager(s) is/are Korean. So, this place falls short of authenticity. At least they tried!"}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago for the first time and honestly, can't wait to go back. It was a Friday night so I was totally cool with it being busy...there was outside waiting area seating and the wait wasn't too bad considering the crowd. I got a Vegas roll, very good. I had a couple girly drinks, all very tasty. The waitress was attentive enough and not annoying.  Overall, great experience only downfall was the sticky table."}
{"text":"If you're in tempe and want sushi... Don't go anywhere else!!! Period!! My one stop for awesome food. I try something new each time and blown away. Service great and food is godly. Eat here!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here because she loves this place. I mean it's a big packed restaurant in a big packed shopping mall - what's not to like? So of course there was a waiting time of 20 minutes even though there were only 3 of us. They text you twice - first time for confirmation and second when a table becomes available - you get 5/10 minutes to show up. So we hung out in the mall for a bit listening to some band playing in the courtyard. When we finally got our table our host walked us all the way to the back near the restrooms. I had some Sapporo beer straight away and ordered the Sea Bass sushi and Sea Snail sushi. Both were good except the rice portion crumbled the moment I picked it up. I also ordered the Char Siu Ramen. Yes I did. Don't know why but I had high hopes and it sounded really good on the menu. Maybe I didn't see the fine print that said \"don't get this - it actually sucks and didn't you come here for the sushi anyway?\" When they brought it I started sipping the broth and WTF - I was contemplating throwing it across the room in a fit of rage and then dancing on the table. But no - didn't have THAT many Sapporos yet. The broth tasted really bland like Campbell's Low Sodium Chicken Broth. Were they really using that crap as broth for ramen? Not to mention it's way overpriced to begin with - nevermind what they actually did to it. At least the char siu was pretty good and the noodles were alright. The broth is a big part of it though and even though they usually get it wrong in these parts it's usually still passable. If there is a next time I'll just stick to the sushi. Plenty of parking. Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Always great by a pretty face and smile, this place is ALWAYS packed.  The food is good, always fresh and very creatively made.  The service was pretty damn good that night too and considering how busy it is, hats of to them.  Overall a bit expensive for sushi but I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for the area in Tempe. The food is decently priced, and the happy hour has great prices; however there are not a lot of options to choose from for the happy hour. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Love everyone here. I'm in for a treat. The yellowtail collar is amazing. I'm so excited. Aaron is great. Love the kale dressing with everything. Yum!! Thank you.  Shout out to Zhen for holding this place down. He is so friendly and great. Impressed!"}
{"text":"My wife & I have eaten at Kabuki more than a dozen times in the past two years and have only had a bad experience once and that was with very slow service for no apparent reason. It is normally pretty busy on weekends and if you go to eat between 8-9p.m. you can expect to wait from 10-20 minutes on average. The food is reasonably priced, atmosphere is decent and the noise level is such that you can talk across the table without raising your voice or practically yelling. I usually get one of the combination dinners and my wife gets sashimi. The food is always good and I will say except for once the service has been excellent. It's one of our favorite places to go that has been consistent with service & food quality with reasonable prices. I would give Kabuki Japanese Restaurant 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best seafood udon ever. They have good prices and the entries are really good too. The food portions are extremely generous and their soups are really good"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm a huge Kabuki fan. I lived in LA for years and went to the one in Hollywood on a regular occasion and was always very satisfied with the food and service. I was expecting the same at this location.... Didn't happen! We didn't have reservations and were planning on sitting at the bar. That's what I always do there. It was cute, they had little couch booths that were open seating so we took one of those and so did another couple as a big group stood up to be seated at their table. We were told they would be over right away to clean the table... There were signs stating we had to order at the bar whenever we needed anything which was fine so my husband first ordered our drinks. He had a Mojito and I had a Long Island iced tea. Whoever made the Long Island clearly had no idea how to make one. I couldn't even drink it. So I traded it for a Mojito. The Mojito was tasty. Then we ordered 3 rolls (gold rush, lotus roll, shrimp tempura roll) & edamame. The edamame came about 10 min later. THEN someone finally comes to clean the table we've been sitting at. The couple sitting next to us ordered when we did. All of their food came about 20 min later. 40 minutes after we ordered ours we got 2 of our rolls. They were ok. Nothing to write home about. Then after we finished eating them we told the bar tender to cancel our last roll, over an hour in now. She said it was almost ready. Went to get it. Brought it out and whatever was on top was NOT baked lobster meat. It was raw gobs of some weird mushy pasty fishy something. Still not sure what that was. So we sent that back too & went home hungry...."}
{"text":"Sushi was the best. Sake sangria was so good and refreshing. Service was excellent! We had the Dynamite roll and Alaska roll first. Then we asked the sushi chef for his suggestion. The asparagus salmon garlic crunch roll was his choice and the best we've ever eaten. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"Went to Kabuki on Saturday night. We made reservations for 7 PM, but it was oddly not necessary, the place was relatively empty. Our server was polite for the most part, but as service started to crumble, she avoided checking in on us.    My husband and I first order wine.  The regular menu has average wines found at your local CVS, and then a few \"special\" wines, which are of better quality, but not deserving of the average $12/glass.   We ordered an appetizer Beef with Sishito Peppers, which was only $4.95 but was too meager (like 2 bites each) and NOT reflective of the quanitty in the picture on the menu.  Not cool to gyp your customers like that.   My husband ordered Philly Hand roll, smoked salmon Philly roll, and a crunch roll.  I ordered a just sashimi salad requesting the dressing on the side. Well all of my husband's order came out and the waitress told me the kitchen made my salad with the dressing and that it was being remade and it will be out shortly.  I was kind and said, \"No Problem\", quietly assuming it would only take just a few minutes ...I mean how long does it take a handful of lettuce and plop a hand full of cubed up fish, anyway?  Well even after my husband politely waited 5 minutes before I told him to start eating (I don't eat rice, so we don't share), he finished his entire meal and ordered some gyoza, which came out before my sashimi salad!  So our meal was not a shared \"awesome\" dinner experience, and was dampened as it was sorely extended by he eating his meal in front of me and for he to wait for me to finish m meal.  Obviously the waitress avoided asking how the meal was going, because she knew it was not going well. Nice one, Kabuki!  Not going back, although all dishes tasted \"fine\".  I need more than \"fine\" to bring me back."}
{"text":"Love the variety of selection. The sushi is always fresh. Love the toro there and the mori soba cold noodles. Jessie our server was the best. My kids love eating the food there. Overall great food and great service."}
{"text":"Great sushi/Japanese food at a fair price. Also very friendly for the gluten intolerant, like my wife. Friendly staff. Busy but not too loud, except for the band playing outside on the weekend."}
{"text":"This place is not spectacular nor is it bad. It serves good food and the wait staff is friendly. The prices outside of HH will hit you in the wallet.  I have tried multiple sushi rolls - both generic and specialty. All good, but nothing spectacular. Also tried the cucumber salad which was OK. The spicy tuna salad which I didn't like. And the house salad which I did like. Wish they had warm edamame instead of cold. Prices are decent, but as with many sushi places it is better to come during HH times.  Ambiance is nice. I can see the many hard surfaces making this place noisy if it is really busy.  Love sitting outside while the sun sets."}
{"text":"Bonjour   This is a delayed REVIEW!. I went check on my son's  Air bnb... Arizona has BUILT  So many r New structures  Especially in Tempe around ASU..  THE Tempe marketplace has grown..I was craving Japanese food The  KABUKII was the only offer. .  My server who's name I forget was  pleasant who was  also my bartender. excellent Margarita. REALLY SMOOTH!  I wanted a light bite! So I decided on Tempura  instead of Sushi..Unfortunately the tempura was absolutely how do I say Horrible..  I should have  TAKEN UBER to Roka Akor in  Scottsdale.   Merci.     .  ."}
{"text":"Bomb! Great environment ! Love the cucumber unagi roll  location is great with the shops in tivoli also. The banana dessert and Mochi were also delicious and the seared ahi plate !"}
{"text":"It's a fun place with a great location at Town Square! They have several happy hours which is always fun & cheaper. The decor is fresh & it's a busy place that is lively. The happy hour specials are a great bargain & the service is always on top of everything.  When you're finished shopping or just getting started it's the perfect stop at Town Square!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a for a quick bite to eat. Was on a Wednesday night and wanted my Lotus Roll on Fire. A signature roll and still one of my favorites. Had the gyoza as well as the dynamite appetizers.   Place was packed for being such a dead location in the Glendale Mall. The customer service was good. Food I think is a little pricy but the atmosphere here is great. Never drink and try to use the restrooms. You may not make it back to your seat. Check it out."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being there for there ribbon cutting ceremony.  Food was exellent! Staff was friendly.  Met with the owner.  He was a nice gentleman.  Overall experience was very good."}
{"text":"I like this place because of its location and friendly wait staff. They got the food to us quickly which was good because we were starving. The happy menu items were okay. The spicy tuna tempura roll and vegas roll came out bland and had poor flavor. The sesame chicken was not bad. The food was 3.5 stars but the waiter was 4.5 stars. Overall not bad!"}
{"text":"Today I was just plain tired or just a hungry monkey drained of energy and cold. The hunt for Chasu ramen was found here!! Found some slices of nice marbled fatty sweet pork, bean sprouts, oodles of noodles, sprinkled green onions all in the light based broth. Mmm hot soup in the belly was comforting. :)  also came with a choice of side salad or miso soup. The spider roll is also a great choice if you like soft shell crab. Veggie ramen was peppery salty with a kick of spice and lots of greens. Service was super!! Merry Christmas Eve!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time last night. Our order:  **2 spicy tuna hand rolls - uh....NOT how you make hand rolls. the nori is supposed to be crunchy, not soggie....but the spicy tuna was good. **Calamari Rings - VERY GOOD!! **Sashimi Salad - very cheap on the sashimi pieces... **BSCR - Baked Scallops on Cali Roll, what a disappointment, talk about mediocre. I expected the scallops to be at least covered in some kind of sauce but it's just literally ...baked scallops....on a cali roll......... **Sunkissed Roll - flavorless **Smoked Philly roll - don't be tricked...this is just a normal philly roll NOTHING special about it.  So....$44/person (i went with 1 other person) afterwards, I was left craving Hana Japanese Eatery over on the west side. Sad.  I gave this place 1 star for decor and location...and 2 stars for our awesome waiter Mike who continuously kept my tea hot and my friend's sprite full."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went last night.  She was craving sushi and it was close to our apartment, so we said what the hell.  We have been going to Kabuki off and on for about 2 years, until now.  Never again.    We ordered a Teriyaki/Tempura platter with 2 rolls, a Spicy Tuna Crunch and Lobster Roll.  Both rolls tasted very 'fishy' which should never be the case.  Even my Beef Teriyaki lacked the punch I was looking for.  The beef was so bland.  The rolls were so loose, that it was almost impossible to eat the whole piece at one time.  It just fell apart.  When the bill came, I wanted to just leave a $20 because that's about as much as I thought the meal was worth, but ofcourse, you just can't do that.  It's sad, because when I first moved out here, it seemed like Kabuki was pretty damn good.  Having lived most of my life in CA, I know I am spoiled when it comes to sushi.  But this place is just not good any more.  Too bad, so sad....."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place.  Note: you can't compare Kabuki to Nobu.  Nobu is... Nobu.  Kabuki, It is standard and it doesn't disappoint.  I'm over AYCES.  You can't beat the location: Tivoli is beautiful.  They have a nice outdoor patio.  Although the interior is beautiful... I'm sure they spent big $$$ on it.  If I am alone, my typical order: spicy tuna roll and sashimi salad.  If I'm with hubby, he orders the sashimi salad (diabetic) and I'll get the baked scallop roll & the sun kissed roll.  Free edamame... kinda too salty.  We bath ours in green tea before nibbling the edamame.   Last comment: great service. Attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"I must say that the Kabuki location in Tivoli Village is just a bit better than the one in Town Square. The fish is always fresh and the service is above par. You can't beat their happy hour or reverse happy hour for the later crowd."}
{"text":"I certainly do not consider myself an authority on the topic of sushi, but I've had my fair share of it.  From my experiences, I consider Kabuki to be one of the best for the money.  First of all, if you spend any time at all in Tempe, you know that Kabuki is ideally located within the Tempe Marketplace. Near the 101, near the 202, next to a Harkins theatre, can't beat that.  More importantly, though, once you're inside Kabuki, the service is friendly and helpful, and the food is consistently good.  Both times I've been to Kabuki, I was there with large groups.  So, with that many people at our table, I think it's that much more impressive that they maintained their good service.  I specifically remember having the Lotus Roll on one of my visits and loving it - check it out!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but it was my first visit, and they were very busy, so I'll give them the benefit of a doubt. I went for the sushi based on other reviews, and I was not disappointed! Everything was fresh, and pieces were cut generously. Prices were pretty standard for what I'd pay most any other sushi joint, but at least the size and quantity of servings meant I didn't have to buy much to get stuffed. Definitely going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Soooo me and my good buddy Hoss finished watching cops and needed some raw blowfish in our life. We open the doors of Kabuki and bam! Linda is there. She was meticulous on her efforts to supply us with drinks and asho delicious sushi. She always had a big smile and a kind heart. No hesitation brought out every sauce imaginable. I will be returning when LINDA is there."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience. I ordered take out and even gave them 30 minutes before I showed up. Once I did they realized they never put the order in. I had to sit in the waiting area for more than half an hour for my order to arrive.  Update: at first I have two stars, but after I realized how flagrantly they handled the situation and looked at me like I was insignificant. I realized this doesn't deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"happy hour:  Lotus on Fire Roll  Sesame Chicken  Mozzarella  YES."}
{"text":"The rolls were great but the service was just ok. There are a lot of japanese restaurants in town to compete with and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is where I had my first date with my wife. Maybe it's the warmness of that memory that convinced my mind this place was excellent. So, so wrong.  Came here a few months ago excited to try some of the sushi I remember being so fresh, beautifully prepared, all of the things you expect from a good sushi place (even if it's a chain, I guess).  The place was close to empty and it was during dinner time, which is strange for this district, but I shrugged it off.  We ordered two mango lemonades to drink and spicy tuna on crispy rice to start.  The drinks came out and there was no fresh mango in the drinks like last time, but whatever, maybe it's not the season (it was, but i get too nice sometimes). I took one sip and it took physical effort to swallow. Way too sweet and the amount of dental work this drink will cost me is out of my budget. Our server came back and we put in our entree orders and told him about the drinks. He apologized and told us he knew, that whoever made the lemonade spilled the ENTIRE THING OF SYRUP INTO THE BATCH ON ACCIDENT. But it \"takes too long\" to make a new batch. What? Um...just water then, thank you. Some 20 minutes later and my wife receives her entree. Just my wife. My entree is probably in the same place our appetizer is hiding.  Of course, we assume that my entree is not far behind, so my wife waits to begin eating her food until mine comes to the table. Waiting...waiting...waiting...  Still waiting.   Finally, it arrives! ....Our appetizer.   So now we're in this sort of awkward position, where my wife doesn't know if she should eat her (now cold) entree before it gets worse or share our \"starter\". We finish the starter and my entree still hasn't arrived. At this point, we've been in the establishment for over an hour. The waiter has come to our table a total of 3 times, no apologies, no anything.   Finally, I just cancel my entree. I relay our complaints to our sever who says he'll let a manager know. The manager never thought to grace us with his presence at the table but did pass a message on to the server to give us a whole 5% off. Because it wasn't obvious enough already that he didn't care and he just had to further prove his point, or something.  Still charged for the entree my wife didn't even touch.  Just....No words. Or a lot of words, by the size of this review, but you get my point.    Went back again because, again, I'm too nice, or I got a concussion and wasn't thinking clearly, or I'm not sure, but here's the report on that: A/C was broken (not the restaurants fault, but it's 118 outside and I'm getting grumpy here), same awful service, food (we got it this time!) went way downhill in quality, portion, etc. Watered down drinks (shots of vodka tasted suspiciously like tap water, drink tasted strong with straw, absolutely no taste when the straw was absent, hmm, no accusations here but I know my drink. Maybe it's because we look so young), will NEVER come back to this embarrassment of an establishment."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Japanese Cuisine. I ordered the chicken and beef teriaki platter which was very good. The portions were large  and the service from our waiter was excellent he kept our drinks full."}
{"text":"The service is always very quick and polite, especially if you're seated at the sushi bar. The food itself never ceases to amaze, especially the Kabuki roll and the Firecracker. They never use a lot of heavy sauce, just good, clean, fresh fish and excellent preparation. Price wise - it's very worth every penny and i always leave feeling satisfied and well spent. Definitely recommended to anyone looking for a good night out!"}
{"text":"My go to sushi spot, I go here more then I'd like to admit.   Kabuki never fails -good menu for everyone .    My favorites include the spicy Chicken fingers ( dipping sauce is the bomb.com), mixed veggie tempura and the lobster roll.    If youre into sweet drinks the Saki Sangria is where it's at, you can thank me later.  Also, if you Like the restaurant sign up for there perks card, you get points for each visit and after a certain amount you get a gift card!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here once a month, ever few months or so.. so, I have enjoyed they're food in the past which kept me coming back. Recently, they've changed the menu (not to my liking). I had the worst service/servicer, I've ever experienced. Granted he was new & I don't want to throw him under the bus sorta speak but, he made me anxious & I think it's irresponsible of management to let him on the floor, knowing he's untrained. The server came back six different times just to ask me about my chicken and albacore dish I ordered & he still got it wrong? So, all and all I had an expensive bill, poor service & crappy food. They'll never take me for my money again!!!! You want good sushi go to sushi 21! Now, there's service & fresh sushi that's kept me coming back for years! Don't know why I decided to cheat on them that day (4-20-2017) lesson learned"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant I've been to yet. I'm sure there are considerably better places in the area, but I have yet to go there. The happy hour, however, is relatively non-existent. I strive for happy hours with sushi discounts, and sadly this is not one of those places. The drink specials on happy hour are pretty non-existent as well, so for me, the food better be damn good if I'm going to go there.   I'm OBSESSED with the Lotus Roll. It's 6 California Rolls arranged in a star pattern topped with baked lobster and smelt roe. Seriously incredible. I would recommend it to anyone who likes lobster. This is also the roll that introduced me to roe and I haven't been able to get enough of it since. This roll is particularly good with roe because the baked lobster is hot and warms up the roe so it's not so cold which can make it taste fishy. If you don't know what roe is, it's fish eggs. It sounds weird, I know. But please do not not get a roll because of it! The sushi chefs at Kabuki really know how to use it artfully."}
{"text":"I wasn't really a fan of this place for a few reasons. I've tried a lot of different sushi places and the sushi here was not impressive. They didn't have a lot of choices for rolls and everything we ate tasted kind of bland. Also we sat at the sushi bar near the back kitchen and the servers kept yelling \"corner\" everytime they passed us which was somewhat annoying. Oh and there was a hair in one of my rolls. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Kabuki has been a pleasant surprise! Located close to the cardinals stadium and an outlet mall, the restaurant is in a nice designed new complex.  The ambient is nice and the waitresses are mindful. The food itself has been good and relatively fresh. I have been there twice where the regular menu has definitely been better in quality than the HH menu until 6 PM. Both has been pleasantly acceptable considering the location -would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Almost everything our family had here for lunch was excellent.  The kids meals were quite large portions.  Poke was very good. Chirashi was good -- not great. Cuts of fish were a bit anemic (but the price was pretty low, so overall this was a reasonable balance).  The real standout (surprising to me, at least) was the Tonkatsu Ramen. Broth was flavorful and not overly salted - as is the case at many places. The pork was relatively thick and was tender and delicious.   Would definitely return. Strongest recommendation for the ramen!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi but the best of the best was Nicole at the bar!! Gave us GREAT suggestions, great conversation and top notch service! I would definitely put this place and the bar with Nicole at the top of your list! ROCK STAR! 10 's up!!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect Japanese restaurant to go to if you need something relatively quick and consistent.  My husband and I have been to the Kabuki franchise here as well as in Los Angeles multiple times...the staff is almost always friendly and the food good (but not great).    I love the spicy tuna on crispy rice and my husband loves the bbq beef ribs with shrimp and vegetable tempura.  Those are must haves!!  We will probably eat here once a month because its very close to our home and its a place we know we can rely on.  Kabuki is a steady eddie but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Kabuki. And it was my first time going on a Thursday night. Service Thursday was incredible. We were able to be seated immediately no wait. Huy, our server, came over and offered us water and /or cocktails as we chose our selections. Huy answered all our questions and checked on us no less than 3 times. Food was really good I had the Unagi cucumber wrap and the miso soup with King Crab. The soup was very flavorful, and the Unagi cucumber wrap was a good sized entree. After dinner we finished with the mochi and ice cream. That was really good. you get two so we got two flavors...green tea and mango. Both were very good, and I think the green tea was the surprise winner. Really good overall experience, and will be going back again."}
{"text":"Went here the other evening (Thursday night) and we had 4 rolls, all delicious but I wouldn't say the bet I have had.  We also had seaweed salad (well seasoned) and a flight of sake-very worth of as one of the sakes is typically one of the pricier ones. It was a later evening so I can't say much for the crowd; we sat on a cushioned bench/couch in the bar area and we were undisturbed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was AMAZING!  came here last night with 5 of my co-workers, some of us have ate here and the others no. I, Myself have never been here so it was a fun new place to try. I'm always use to eatting at Saketini or Ra Sushi.  I ordered Calamari as an appetizer, I was not a big fan of the deep fried...I've had better. However their dark dipping sauce was delicious!!!! It had a kick of chili in it, exactly what it needed.   The shrimp tempura and Lotus roll,  The Lotus roll was good, a little too seafoody for me...I loved the lobster but I just couldn't bare the smell (Dumb huh? I'm only in a sushi place) but whatever my body is weird like that. Haha  Dillon was our waiter, I kept giving him a hard time but it was all good fun, He was great! I would reccommend and request him to the hostesses if possible!  ALL in ALL, great place"}
{"text":"I made a reservation and A+ on coming in 20-25 min. early, with our table already set up. We were seated immediately. =)   Sushi was surprisingly alright for me. I love how the rolls were HUGE, but as far as taste, it was somewhat off for me. Not that flavorful. Ehhh.   Sad to say, I wouldn't spend my $ on this place, again. Naked Fish is still #1 and my GO-TO place for sushi!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite sushi restaurants in Tempe, we arrived pretty close to opening time so obviously we would expect the customer service to be on point but it wasn't. The hostess sat us in the corner where the blinds were still closed and I had to get up to ask for the sushi menu they didn't do the obvious and supply one when we were seated! On top of that my wife got ice tea and she added her lemon and spun it that's when she noticed there was stuff floating around, we asked the waitress and she said \" she thinks it could be particles from the tea, but wasn't to sure\"! The sushi was the only good thing about our experience here today."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here at least once a month now. Delicious sushi and we just found out about their amazing happy hour prices! My go to drink is the Sake Sangria and his is the Sake Bombs. We like to order the philly roll, tuna roll, hot soup, garlic edamame and one specialty roll (or two if we are hungry tigers!). I love the atmosphere, the prices and the food is fresh and delicious every time! Can't go wrong. :-)"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I'm giving 1 star for cleanliness of restaurant and 1 star for fast and friendly service. But for the food, all I can say is Overpriced for the Quality!   My daughter ordered a few sushi rolls, and those were not very fresh tasting. Even your basic California roll tasted as if we found it at your local grocery store. Very basic.  I ordered the teriyaki salmon, and that came with a small bowl of rice, your choice of white or brown, a side salad and a bowl of luke warm broth (soup).  Absolutely none of that got my tastebuds excited!  We had a few appetizers as well. We ordered the mixed Tempura, and some kind of Japanese quesadilla. They were very minimal and basic, if ordering appetizers for a big party, I'd go with ordering 2 or more of the same thing, because the quesadilla appetizer came with 5 small pieces and the mixed Tempura came with a Handful of mixed veggies and one shrimp.   Overall, it was not worth the price for the value of what we got and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"love the lunch price rolls from 4.50 start price loved it. service is good and the rolls are fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"It was a little on the pricy side, but the food was very good. Our waiter was lighthearted with a really good attitude and sense of humor. The atmosphere was also very nice. I had the dragon roll and alaska roll, tge dragon roll had a very nice presentation, and the alaska roll was that best i had ever had. If it werent for the price id go more often"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have the best sushi for a reasonable price and the customer service is always great. Every Monday, it's Happy Hour all day which is a huge plus. Also, I'd like to point out that Jay, the gentleman that works behind the sushi bar is amazing! He is the friendliest man and knows how to make the best dynamite roll!"}
{"text":"I came here last week and the food was AMAZING!!! Justin, the manager, welcomed my fiance and I and sat us immediately next to my favorite sushi chef Nick.  (He makes the best spicy octopus roll!) So delicious!!! My server, this time, was Jeni and she was THE BEST!!!! She was so friendly and cordial. She recommended the lobster dynamite and it was to die for. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some quality sushi in AZ."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this place since moving to LV from HI.  Place is closeby, good service and good food.  However yesterday was prolly our last visit. I don't know wot happened?! Miso soup was warm, in fact lukewarm, shrimp tempura was soggy and check out the short ribs that was served to me. I felt so insulted. I mentioned to waitress who mentioned to day manager. They explained that's how they receive it from supplier. They gave me 10 percent off. Wow! Told them they can keep their discount and tipped more than usual. Looking at \"ribs\" made me sick as the meal went meal time went on. Never again. Pics attached."}
{"text":"Always a delicious meal at Kabuki! Our favorite appetizer is the Firecracker, but this time we went with the gyoza which was awesome!! They also had a yummy green tea cheesecake for dessert which was wonderful. Love the patio seating and the service from Leo was great!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on the ocean and find it strange when I find great sushi in the middle of the desert.  I avoid shellfish and my dinning partner eats vegan; we had no problem finding a wide selection of tasty beautiful sushi options.  Like most good sushi joints it's a little pricey, about $75 for two.  In full disclosure I do tend to feast when I eat sushi...    It's a great place to meet a friend.  It is just the right balance of fine dining and urban contemporary.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This is probably the least delicious sushi I have ever had. It was mostly deconstructed with piles of spicy purée fish on top of California rolls.   It was fresh, just bland. On the other hand the staff was super nice and kept up well with our drinks.  Had to track them down to pay our bill...."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim for quick date night dinner. I have to admit we were a little leery as always with trying a new place but turned out to be a great choice. The soup & salad were great to start with & our dinner came out in perfect timing and was just as delicious. We would definitely eat here again if in the area."}
{"text":"I went to Kabuki last night for a drink with 4 other friends and to get a little Sushi.  Drinks took forever to get the waiter told me that I had to order a drink first instead of sushi really WTF.  It was an hour for one order of drinks and two appetizers.  We then had to go out of our way to get our bill.  Great atmosphere good food Crappy staff.."}
{"text":"I am a sushi lover! I really love the traditional sushi. This place is not to my liking it's a typical sushi chain. The raw fish didn't taste that fresh at all. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"A popular and affordable California based Japanese restaurant, always hip and cool with a lot of ever changing dishes that are beautifully presented and tasty.  Many weekends have waits and they have a great happy hour menu too."}
{"text":"Kabuki was referred to me by my co-worker. Right in the heart of Tempe Market Place, this sushi diner is one of my favorites. Though a little pricey, you get what you pay for from hot seafood dishes, to cold sushi platters, Kabuki has it... The ambiance has more of a dressy casual posh feel and is good for groups. One thing that is holding me from adding another star is that the sushi seems to be a super cold, like its been thawed. But, other than that, it tastes good. Try it out..."}
{"text":"Good place!  Went on my birthday.  Sushi was a decent price ($10-12) and they have pictures in the menu which is very helpful.  The drinks are definitely on the expensive side so during happy hour it might be better."}
{"text":"Yellowtail sashimi is my favorite and I order it at every sushi place I enter.  Kabuki served the worst plate of yellowtail sashimi I have ever put in my mouth.  I don't know if the TOMATO they served on the plate with it changed the flavor or what?  It was really bad.  I actually sent it back.  I had a Lotus on Fire Roll that I would rate 2/5   My cousin had miso soup, salad, and a dangerous cup of tea--so hot she couldn't hold the cup with out burning her hands let alone take a sip.   I always sit at the sushi bar when I eat sushi but I was with my cousin who doesn't eat sushi and we wanted a table so we could chat.  Otherwise, I would always sit at the sushi bar.  There were only a few tables during what seemed like a quiet and slow lunch hour.  The service was terrible.  I had to look for the waitress to get a refill.  When she dropped off the food she never came back.  Since I hated the sashimi I was watching for her so I could send it back.  After sending it back she still put it on the bill.  What a terrible experience and awful service.  Save your time and money.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place was just okay.  We had the omacase platter, a California roll and an eel roll.   Use the check in offer--free cali roll--which is a great deal!  The sushi was kina warm which made us a little nervous.  The server just set the food down on the table---we had to flag our server down to tell us what was what on the omacase.  Did not check on us for drink refills.  I would go back and give this place a second try to see if service is better."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place; close to home and located in the beautiful Tivoli Village. The food is always good and so is the service. They even have a rewards program which is a bonus. I believe the rewards are 25 dollars off, and free foods for birthdays and anniversary."}
{"text":"I love this place! You can get really delicious sashimi for a reasonable price. The Tokyo mojito I tried was pretty good. I even brought my kiddos here, granted they love sushi, but they ate oyakodon and loved it too."}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab sushi, have eaten here many times and spent lots of money here. Love forward to it."}
{"text":"On June 23, 2026 I ordered 3 Mushroom Miso soups, appetizers, and rolls to go in Kabuki in Tivoli Village, Las Vegas, NV.  My bill was $115.73 When I arrived home my two daughters and I were excited to eat our food.   Two containers with Mushroom Miso were good we thought but the third container of Miso soup had no mushrooms but had a  piece of a plastic bag instead of mushrooms. Approximately 2\"x1.5\".  I called Kabuki and described the situation to a manager. It took him about almost 10 (!) minutes to realize what is going on. He asked me several questions about me and my order: where, when, how and what exactly I ordered. Several times I told him what my order was. Finally, I asked him how it related to a plastic and what he is going to do about the situation with that piece of plastic in my soup.  He thanked me for the information I provided and said he would go talk to staff and kitchen to do an investigation. I was really confused. Is that everything he had to tell me?  He called me back in about 25 minutes. He said his name is Hoon and he thanked me again for giving him the information. Hoon said he is sorry and told me he did the investigation, and he does not know where this plastic came from.  He asked again and again a lot of questions, including the color, shape, and size of the plastic. I offered to even send him a photograph from my phone, but he said he didn't want it. Hoon guessed it came with mushrooms.  -Ok, Hoon, so...? - I asked. -Oh, Are you planning on coming back? (Good question, BTW).I think you are familiar with our menu. We will give you a bowl of miso and ONE roll at your choice for free.  We have been loyal customers there. Bringing friends and family there and having lunch or dinner, spending thousands of dollars (what is easy to track with Red Mask card) we were honored with One miso and ONE roll FOR FREE.  My daughter that had miso with me and I both ended up staying up all night and next morning with diarrhea and stomach pains. We do not think we want to be back to that restaurant and would not recommend you."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food. Tremendous happy hour. Great service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I are currently looking for a favorite sushi joint, so we decided to try this place after looking up reviews here on Yelp!  I was digging the contemporary Japanese look! The lighting was very nice and ambient. We were seated very quickly, even during Happy Hour. Could be because there were only two of us and it was a Monday.  I ordered a peach kiwi-flavored Calpico soda ($2.50), which our waitress thought they were sold out of, but they actually weren't. It came with little bits of kiwi, which I thought was neat!  I ordered the Alaskan Roll ($6.95 during Happy Hour), since the Rainbow Roll wasn't a part of the Happy Hour menu. That's okay because it was AMAZING! I don't know what sauce the roll was topped with, but it was very good.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and the eel sauce complimented the roll perfectly. Looks like I've found another favorite roll!  My husband ordered the Gold Rush Roll ($5.95 during Happy Hour) and he said that he loved it.   We decided to order a third roll that we could both share, so we chose the Las Vegas Roll ($6.95 during Happy Hour). I've never had a roll with cream cheese in it, but it was very good. It left a sort of cheesy aftertaste, but that's probably not the chef's fault at all.  Only bad thing of the whole experience was the service. Our waitress took a very long time to get us our food, longer than a couple folks who came in after us. She also only checked on us a single time (when we were already 99% done with our food), and took a while to get us our bill when we were completely done.   Excellent stuff, despite the sub par service. Maybe the waitress was just having a bad day, who knows. We will definitely be coming back, but really only for Happy Hour since we can hardly afford the normal prices."}
{"text":"Lobster dynamite is still my favorite.. That dish gets more stars ok! They have a happy hr mon-fri but the selections are just so so  Watch your mouth if you order green tea.. It is always 300degrees never fails;)"}
{"text":"\" I should've ordered the calamari\" but the dessert egg thing i ordered was amazing. Also the waiter was sweet and told me he liked my style! Thanks kabuki"}
{"text":"I had some sushi and salad was better than I thought. It's an american Japanese dining (served soup was first and some other reasons) but very good food and nice interior. All servers were nice/friendly. I didn't know they have soba and ramen. I will go tomorrow again for sure!!"}
{"text":"There is not much for me to say about Kabuki except for ehhhhhhhh.  I have been to this location twice now, and both times and yet to be wowed with both the service and quality of the food I am paying for, none of the less the long wait times for a table.  My recent adventure is as follows:  Friday night, 8:00 pm, party of 4.  My fiance and I arrived first, put our name in, and was told a 30 minute wait.  That sounded tolerable, so up to the bar we went.  No place to sit, so we ordered at the bar: 2 beers, $10.75 with tip.  AND, these were less than a pint!  I was in awe.  When we finally sat down, our waitress came, but seemed to lack basic knowledge of terms in the sushi world.  Everything I asked came with an \"I don't know\" or \"I have never heard of that\" with no offering to even find out if they had it in the back: Toro, White Tuna, Albacore Tataki, or ANY specialty fish.  Highly disappointed.   We ordered a plethora of rolls for all of us to share, all of which were just ehhhhh.  The Kabuki Special roll was a joke.  I have never seen a roll lack so much in terms of presentation in my life for their \"high quality\" fish assortment.  The blobs of mush and fish topped 2 or 3 of the rolls.  We called this the mystery meat of the night.  The shishito peppers we ordered were undercooked and lacked the sauce I am traditionally used to them coming with.  The yellowtail sushi was bland and not memorable, which is unfortunate considering yellowtail is my favorite.  For the price, quality, and service that I have received, I don't think I will be visiting Kabuki any time in the near future.  If I am going to spend money on sushi, I want all three of those things listed above."}
{"text":"I generally write good reviews, but this experience wasn't exactly the greatest. The food was good and speedy service. Our sever wasn't exactly the greatest though to say the least"}
{"text":"This place has a great Happy Hour Menu and nice ambience. I've been here a few times. It's dimly lit, you you can have your privacy but can still see your food. I ordered the Seaweed Salad ( I'm on a diet :/ ) which was surprisingly filling and my friend ordered the Calamari and California rolls. The staff was helpful. Previously when I came we ordered almost everything in the happy hour appetizer  menu and couldn't finish. Good for large groups or intimate settings."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience, good sushi. Great place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Solid Japanese/Sushi joint. Large menu with many different rolls offered. Sashimi pieces looked and tasted fresh, chicken yakitori was also flavorful and tender. Can get pretty pricey pretty quick depending on your appetite though."}
{"text":"Everything from my previous review stands... But there's a slight forgetfulness in service...so we had to backtrack. It wasn't bad enough to rate them negatively, but just enough to be annoyed. We were sat rather quickly..... Took a long time for our server to even acknowledge us and offer to take our drink order. So long that by the time she did... We knew everything we were going to order and some. Seems like there was a possible miscommunication on their behalf and maybe she didn't know she had a new table. Service during our meal was good though and she even came and gave us a last call for the kitchen. After all our  plates were licked clean, we watched as they cleaned tables and our check was no where to be found. I had to stop her in the middle of her cleaning to ask for it.   Food was great though. We ordered Kenny of small plates to share."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  Came here for lunch yesterday and dinner today.  So yummy and good service.  Probably will be back next weekend.  So good!"}
{"text":"Been dining here ever since it opened, and have dined quite often here as well.  Pros: -Love that they give you an option for brown rice rather than the traditional white jasmine rice. -Happy Hour (hours) are ideal! :) -centrally located  -plenty of parking -some hosts are cordial and appear to be happy they are there -affordability  Cons: -happy hour food selection is at its minimal (compared to earlier days) -service is a bit inconsistent lately -some food/dish portion has also been inconsistent lately  I do not mind reccommending this spot. It's good food, service is ok, and priced just right! :)"}
{"text":"So i've never been here before and wanted to try the sushi.  i got an Omakase deluxe sushi combination, which was one of Kabuki's recommended dishes.  It wuz NOT VERY GOOD!  The spicy tuna roll was extremely sloppy and the fish was not very fresh in any way, shape, or smell.  The next day I ate at Pacific Seafood Buffet and the fish was better there.... and lunch buffet is only $8.39 or so.  I used the yellowtail nigiri from there to compare the fish and I wanna say that the buffet's fish was actually more palatable.   If  that's the fish they're serving, the prices really need to reflect the quality.  This is one of those places that you should probaly only get the rolls at because the sauces and other crap cover up the actual taste of the fish.    I will admit their hot food is pretty good... I'd give that 4 stars...  and it seems they have a very extensive cocktail, sake, and shochu menu.  The service was good, even though we had a 2 year old eating rice and miso with his bare hands (thus throwing rice grains all over the place).  Summary: 1. crappy nigiri and sashimi 2. decent hot foods 3. good service for families"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal or experience. Food is amazing, and service is typically top notch. I really miss their \"boat\" specials for large parties, but I can make due without."}
{"text":"The staff was very kind and the food was delicious! Great presentation on both the food and the restaurant itself. I only took off one star because when I visited it was one of the first few days of the year where it was starting to get very hot, so the restaurant was unusually warm. That being said, I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Kabuki has THE BEST SUSHI in Arizona, my fiancé HATES sushi but I took him to kabuki and he loved it, they are normally always busy so service isn't that great, everytime I go there it takes forever to get the check, or a refill on a drink, every now and then its not too bad but normally the service isn't that great. The portions are good size, I normally go during happy hour to get cheap sushi, but the sushi rolls are huge! LOVE IT!! And its all fresh, so if your looking for a place to eat sushi where you wont end up getting sick-this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI.   Kabuki has great sushi and great drinks..sometimes it can get kinda pricey so i don't go all the time, but i absolutely love the place :)"}
{"text":"Had a great time here with a few other yelpers.   The staff are super nice specifically the bartender/waiter who i think was named James. It's been too long.  From what little we ordered the slices of fish were fresh and quality cuts with no hit of being anything other then the finest.   The Garlic Edamame was absolutely amazing as well as nice and garlicy.   Cocktails and Saketinis were nice and flavorful and pack a nice punch.   See this people? This is why you should procrastinate on writing reviews. Because you absolutely forget all the selling points that made you enjoy the experience.  I had the Spicy Ramen which was made aware to me by our bartender that it's nothing more then over-glorified instant. My other option was a combo plate but that was just way too much food and double the price so i grabbed the ramen. Cant really compare it to any of the ramen shops because you have one that comes out of a bag against one that takes hours of boiling down bones then adding other magical mystical animals to give it the flavor you want. What came out was a nice sized bowl of hot soup with chewy noodles and a lot of bean sprouts. Again it doesnt compare to any dedicated ramen shops but was good enough.  I'd give this place another shot if i was in the area but there's just so many other places to choose from."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience eating here! My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and had great service. Our waiter, Huy, was very attentive. He made sure we had drinks and our food was to our liking. The food was great and exactly what I wanted and we didn't have to wait long to receive our food. I've been to this restaurant before and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Glendale?  That's a big negative.  I've been to Kabuki on a few occasions and have never been impressed.  In fact, if it weren't for the Lobster Dynamite I probably would have given it one star.  The sushi is probably the worst part.  Very plain, non fresh tasting sushi rolls slapped together and thrown on a plate.  Completely uninspiring and disappointing.  Not that Glendale is a sushi mecca but Fresh Wasabi on Bell blows this place out of the koi pond.    If you are dining out with someone there are not a lot of options at Westgate.  As crazy and rediculous as that sounds.  You would think they could get some good places to eat around two pro sports arenas and a concert venue.  Nope, NOT one single decent restaurant.  But as I was saying if you are forced to eat in this area and can't talk your party into going to Yardhouse (only cause the beer selection) then stick to the Lobster Dynamite and try to smile."}
{"text":"Terrible staff that does not know their own menu. The manager is unprofessional and ride. They literally do not know their own menu, it's sad. I'd suggest the management be fired and hire new management that will train the employees to be less worthless."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and service is the best. I would definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Hubby and I needed a pre-prom (chaperoning, that is) dinner, and the Tempe Marketplace was very close to the venue. He suggested the new Japanese place, and although I was hesitant about sushi in the desert, I agreed to go. The restaurant was pretty busy, but we were seated right away. The table still had a chunk of someone else's seafood on it- not a positive start. We ordered iced teas- Hubby's oolong tasted unusual- neither of us cared for it.   We decided to order the Love Boat (a 2-order minimum sampler platter, essentially) for about $18 a piece. Miso soup came first- it was hot but on the bland side. The came the boat- it was so huge I was a little embarrassed to have it on the table, and it turned out to be far too much food, even for 2 hearty eaters like ourselves. The tempura veggies and shrimp were quite fresh and tasty. In the California rolls, the crab was Krab, and pretty mushy. The dumplings were flavorful, but the meats-teriyaki chicken and beef ribs) were barely luke-warm when they came out. I found both to be on the tough side, but Hubby liked them anyway. The mussels were served on a half-shell and were smothered in a creamy cheesy sauce. Hubby hated it, mainly due to a texture issue, and I thought it was edible, but I probably wouldn't choose to again. Everything was layered on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce and tomato wedges which we didn't even end up touching. The fresh pineapple was a nice desserty finish. The service was fine, and the waitress was conscious of our time limits due to prom.   Hubby definitely wants to go back and I'm on the fence. Maybe for the tempura..."}
{"text":"Went here last night on a double date with my husband and his sister and her husband. We were seated right away but were sat right next to a huge party. We nicely asked if there was a booth ( there was because it was quiet) and the hostess could not have been more annoyed. Oh well! after 15 min of no service we finally were welcomed and asked for a drink order, which we were ready to place our food at that time. Between the 4 of us we ordered 5 rolls, we wanted a light dinner, and it literally took an hour and 15 min to be served. We watched other tables around us be seated and get their sushi before us. Another waiter even came over and asked if everything was alright because he could see the confusion on my face. The food was okay but the rolls were very sloppy and fell apart when picked up which made using chop sticks quite difficult.  I am just so disappointed, to get excited about date night and to have sad service. =["}
{"text":"This was a horrible service experience, I went with a party of 4 we arrived around 930. Ordered soft drinks, and simple fare.Our server was really pushing us to hurry up and order. We did ,our food came out with several mistakes and instead of offering to fix the mistakes he only said,\" sorry ' bout that.\". When one of the ladies asked for a refill on her beverage he said \" we already dumped out the tea\". When she asked for a soda he said \" I can only get you water, we shut off the soda machine.\" Then they , the wait staff, even though there were several tables still dining,started putting chairs up on tables and turned the lights up to full brightness and got very loud and abrupt. I am a Chef and view this as a Horrible customer service experience. The sad thing is I work within view of this establishment and when I'm asked by our guests for a recommendation I will likely point at Kabuki and recount my experience ,finishing with I wouldn't go there."}
{"text":"I come here as a treat every few months and it never disappoints! The food is divine - I recommend you get the garlic edamame, holy wow! The wait staff is friendly and prompt, the sushi is amazing, and their kid's meals are perfect! My only complaint is the HUGE upcharge to substitute soy paper instead of seaweed, $1.50 per roll! Soy paper is very inexpensive, it's an overpriced substitute and I took an entire star for it. I've come here on dates, with my kiddo, even all alone, and I feel like I'm pampering myself :)"}
{"text":"YAY! I love Kabuki!  So, I had ordered a decent variety of items all of which I was satisfied with. They include: vegas roll, shrimp tempura roll, soy ramen, edamame, salad with ginger dressing, miso soup, and the beef&chicken teriyaki combo with rice and tempura vegetables.  I pretty much liked all of it except the shrimp tempura. That is because I don't hink I'm a big fan of cold food. I like warm food. So in other words, I guess I don't like sushi. I like Japanese food, just not sushi. Lol!  This is a fun place and they even have happy hour! Yay for discounts!"}
{"text":"Great looking place but too pricey. The food was pretty good but I could find similar dishes for less elsewhere. If you're looking to impress someone then I suppose you could go here but I would rather pay less for good food and have okay surroundings."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago before a hockey game. My friend decided and suggested we have sushi. Well, I must say that the selection is great, the rolls were anything but skinny and the drink selection was great. The only criticism I have is that the crowd could be on the douche baggy side and can get loud and obnoxious after a while. Still, a great place to have a few rolls and drinks."}
{"text":"mmm what can i say! The food was great! And it always helps when the staff is ultra friendly and for the waitress we had she gave us her best picks on the menu that were her fav and she was so right. The organic tofu was really awesome along with the udon noodles and the soft shell crab. I cant recall which sushi roll we had but that by far was def awesome. The price is a decent for being located in Tivoli village. The restaurant has high ceilings with really nice wall art and the table placement gives everyone ample room to move around and what not unlike some restaurants you can barley move out of your seat without hitting the person behind you."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service and attitude of the staff makes this a no go place"}
{"text":"This was my second time here at Kabuki Japanese Restaurant. They're located in the Westgate second floor. There are a lot of signs that can point you there from the first floor. My 1st time here was a year ago. I saw my waiter this time who is now promoted to a manager. He still remembered me and where I sat 1 year ago. Pretty neat.   We went on a Friday night at 9PM and the wait (first available table inside, sushi bar, or outside table) was a 35-45minutes wait but totally worth it. They have a waiting app that you can download to monitor how many people are in line ahead of you and they'll also text you when your table is ready. The design of the place is low light and a classy atmosphere. A great place for large groups, date night, and just casual eating (us).   The food is NOM.  For sushi, we ordered the king crab roll (crab based sushi wrapped in cucumber), sunkissed roll (spicy tuna based), and lobster roll (lobster goodness!). Out of those three, the lobster roll was by far everyone's favorite. Regular prices for specialty sushi that you'll find anywhere else.  For noodles, we had the tonkosu ramen and the tempura udon. The ramen is especially good if you prefer your ramen not as savory. The tempura was prepared on the side and added when you're ready to eat. The tempura sauce is sweet and really good to dip your fried shrimp and vegetable too. The noodles weren't expensive at all.   The service was speedy. My mom and sister acted like they were in extreme scarcity of food, and asked the waitress to bring out the food as fast as possible. We had no idea that the Japanese food can be made so fast!   Overall, we had a really good experience and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. Place isnt bad...pretty pricey for Japanese food but the local area bumps the price up. Sushi is great here, the staff do a great job and the restaurant has a great appearance. I will probably eat here again one day. Kudos to the staff. For you sushi enthusiast they have toro!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sushi. I also enjoy their pork cutlet. I have been to many places and never seen it prepped like that before. All the times I've been there I have only had one issue. The waitress could not seem to get our drinks right, and when she did my hot tea was cold. This didn't get resolved until after our food was out. Other than that it has been a good experience."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Kabuki, it was honestly the best experience I have ever had at Kabuki. We were seated right away and our waiter was so nice and helpful. I come to Kabuki quite often, so I noticed there service getting a lot better. I got an unagi bowl with sushi rice and it was the best unagi bowl I've had. It was made perfectly and I didn't want to finish it because the bowl was so good, I just wanted more."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend for lunch this past weekend. We honestly had the best service. Our waitress, Linh, was very nice and she came to check on us a good amount of time. Not too much and not too little. I got a Salmon poke bowl and changed the chili sauce to the wasabi soy sauce. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend getting it. The restaurant looked clean and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend coming here and to this location. This is one of the best Kabukis that I've been to."}
{"text":"I am pretty darn picky when it comes to sushi - but was really impressed here. It's a really big restaurant, and a bit loud, but fun atmosphere and fast service.  I was thrilled to find a variety of sushi rolls at reasonable prices that weren't too crazy or outlandish with ingredients. The garlic edamame was delicious, as was the sake sangria. I would definitely come back here and think this is your best bet for dinner before a movie at Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant after we were done shopping. It was pretty good. The sushi was fresh and the teriyaki chicken was delicious. The portion was perfect for 1 person. Service was fantastic. Jason, our waiter, was nice and professional. I would come back again when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to go for Japanese food. The food is pretty good, never had a bad experience with food. I just feel its a convenient place for lunch if you are shopping at Townsquare, other than that I would never go here just for lunch.   You can find the dishes that they have at local places for cheaper and tastier."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour this afternoon and the sushi was excellent! The salmon nigiri and rolls definitely didn't let me down! Price wise, happy was a dream!! Lol"}
{"text":"Ok Kabuki is a typical sushi chain restaurant. Cool atmosphere, decent sushi -- no where as good as authentic Japanese restaurants in my opinion. I probably come here more often than the food is worth but it is right down the street and quite frankly I am lazy. I would give them an extra star BUT literally every single time I have been here (I have been here more times than I could count) the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. It takes several minutes to be greeted once you walk in the door and even longer to be greeted and have your drink order taken. Every single time your food will come after you have asked yourself several times \"Shouldn't I be eating by now?\". I finally lost it last night after countless bad experiences with the service here and will probably not be returning. Guess I will have to drive a little further now for my sushi. However, if you are feeling patient and do decide to try Kabuki their Alaska Roll is super."}
{"text":"Great food & service. Always worth the trip from the strip. I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal or service."}
{"text":"Love the mixed seafood and noodle soup called Seafood Nabeyaki Udon $15.95 listed under noodle dishes. Good sushi rolls. Especially love the Lobster Roll which is hot lobster over California Roll for $12.95. Good service. Light crowd on Sunday night at 5:30. Located in Town Square shopping center. Parking is a bitch on the street but there is a garage about a block away."}
{"text":"I order Yaki soba for my daughter, came fried egg noodle with a lot of cabbage. The noodles over cooked, I asked Manager how come you serve me over cooked noodles like that, and the soba noodles wasn't there, the Manager acting unprofessional and argued with me treat me like I was his Mom not His customer. I never wanna coming back to Kabuki so many Japanese restaurants in Town, the worse Manager I Ever deal in my life!!!"}
{"text":"Always awesome,  food, service, atmosphere. For rolls try the albacore crunch roll, Sunkist, and the dragon roll.  The dragon is the best in town for quality. Sashimi the fatty yellowtail is always a hit."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I'm not much into sushi and wanted to try something new during this visit to phoenix. Out server, Jess, was VERY helpful. The vegas roll was a good combo of krab, avacado and deep fried goodness. Then I had the bbq beef rib entree, which was also delicious. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the veggie ramen. We will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"great service, beautiful presentation, nice quality rolls, good flavor. nice menu variety. what else can you ask for at a sushi restaurant?"}
{"text":"I always love coming here for happy hour. Im not sure how i havent written a review sooner. But anyway,  what made me write one right now was our experience last night. We came at 920 a little later than we usually come for happy hour, but everyone was great!  Our waitress was Aspyn. Shes a total gem! She was super friendly and i really enjoyed the fact that she asked us if we had any allergies she should be aware of , as many times as weve been , i dont believe we were ever asked that before. We dont have any.. but it was just a bonus on customer service. She interacted with my son as if she was a close family friend.  Definitely a plus in my books! If youre reading this Aspyn... never change!! Although i focused more on customer service in this review,  the sushi is AMAZING.  the alaskan roll is a new favorite of mine. I also loved their new asparagus salmon roll.. tastes very fresh! I will keep coming back for more"}
{"text":"Every time I've come here for happy hour there is a fly buzzing around our table 3x in a row. And the last time our sushi was warm, sketch. The service is okay and the happy hour is pretty good."}
{"text":"Hip japanese resto in Tempe. Good, vibrant ambience & crowd. Mostly college students flock here. Vegas roll didn't look as fancy as RA's but it is soooo good. It was a pleasant surprise being served w a small plate of edamame while we wait for our appetizers. The pretty Asian server we had (i didn't get her name) was genuinely friendly & accommodating. The Philadelphia roll was fantastic. The only thing negative was my boyfriend had a cooked dish of, I think beef, but they piled it up w so much greens on his plate & only small slices of the meat. As much as I enjoyed my rolls, I don't think he did on his food. He doesn't eat raw fish but he took me there bec I love sushi. I didn't see bento boxes. But I know this place serves cooked asian dishes too. We will be back for the rolls. Promise:)"}
{"text":"This is a review for the bar area and their happy hour drinks only. The bartender was extremely nice and friendly. We spent quite some time here sipping on sake sangria, which was rather delicious. We also had a bottle of sake that was on special. While I didn't have any of their food, the drinks and service impressed me enough that I will back for some other samplings."}
{"text":"For being a franchise kind of sushi restaurant, it's actually decent. Since it is a franchise restaurant, you're paying a little more than you would at other smaller sushi places around town. If you really love sushi, I would suggest to go to those AYCE places instead and you'll spend the same amount."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't like this place is an idiot. Even some of the sushi snobs I know love this place."}
{"text":"This location is right in the middle of Tempe Marketplace which is very convenient.  When you walk in, you see the very interesting and contemporary decor.  This is definitely a chain restaurant but that's ok.  There is such thing as chain restaurant that serves yummy food :)    The service was very prompt and nice.  We had usual selections of sushi which turned out to be ok, spicy tuna roll, and kabuki roll which was very interesting...better than we expected.  The ama-ebi was bigger and sweeter than the one served at Shimogamo.  Oh and Ikura (salmon roe) was fresh.  Price wise, it was more than what we are used to b/c the prices at Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena, CA are usually cut in half all night long.  Overall, it was good enough to add to the list of fav/convenient restaurants.  So Shimogamo? or Kabuki?......I say Kabuki b/c of it's fun location.  You get to shop, have desserts, and the area is very lively.   *Location = good *Price = expected...around $90/couple without alcohol *Food = pretty good"}
{"text":"I am definitely NOT a fan of Kabuki. Of all the times I have been to the restaurants in California, I have never once suggested going there on my own. The prior times were because of some sort of event with friends.  Why did I go to the one in Vegas? Well friends that live there wanted to have dinner with the BF and I and they picked Kabuki. I decided to give it try because when you least expect it, things can surprise you. Right? But unfortunately, this time it didn't happen.   I'll give the place props for being the nicest (decor + ambiance) one I've been to. However, I'm still not a fan of the food. I was very disappointed with the sushi yet again. I could get way better and way cheaper at other places. However, I did love their Tokyo Mojito in Lychee flavor. That was pretty delicious. The calamari was decent but I enjoyed it better than the rolls.  The other thing I didn't get was their plates. I mean they really tried to make it all nice and super chic but their humongous heavy frosted glass plates (for a small roll on each) were not working. We were seated at a booth and we BARELY got everything to fit. Someone needed to work on their space management or make the tables bigger.  Back to the positive. One other thing that I liked is that it's located in a pretty shopping area. Much like Victoria Gardens and it was beautiful at night (minus the overhead airplanes landing and taking off). haha  Unless someone absolutely has/wants to go, I won't even think of going back. If I have to, I'll stick to the alcohol and their appetizers."}
{"text":"Good casual place especially if u are eating with sushi and non sushi fans. Fish is fresh, not many complaints for this place especially considering its a chain. They have  a good happy hour. I'm definitely a regular."}
{"text":"All-- they have a vegetarian menu now! But the best thing I ate there was the spicy tofu sushi .. Fried tofu with jalapeño on top but accompanied with some amazing sauce like a spicy mayo touch to it! Classic! Must try dish for sure!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and decided to try this place. Not only was the food delicious, but the service was exceptional!! Our waitress Lihn (I hope I spelt her mane correctly) was amazing!!! She made our dining experience that much better! Thank you Lihn for making my husband's birthday special!!"}
{"text":"Food was typical and unfortunately not above and beyond. Atmosphere is alright, however, if you have vertigo, do not use the bathrooms. They are designed on an angle and I was very dizzy using the ladies room. It was clean and wait staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Great cooked food. On Election Day, if you came in with your \"I Voted Today\" sticker, Kabuki treated you with a complimentary California Roll. I also celebrated my birthday with my son and daughter with a birthday coupon that they load on your Red Mask rewards card, It was Happy Hour. We capitalized on the discounts on many food items.   We loved the Wagyu Beef Fried Rice. The beef was tasty and the rice was the perfect consistency. The flavor profile almost reminded me of my favorite salt fish and chicken fried rice in Hong Kong.   The California rolls were okay, but not my favorite because their rice was too wet and sticky. They also look like they were produced in a mold.   They offer a generous portion of grilled salmon teriyaki. We love the ginger salad that came with it. The salad was probably the highlight of our meal.  Finally, our Tokyo steam bun filled with braised pork belly was beautifully presented. The pork belly was tender and drizzled with a sweet and savory sauce. The cilantro and slaw was a delicious fusion twist to the morsel.   Thank you, Kabuki for a nice birthday meal! I will be back for the ginger salad and the Tokyo steamed bun. Our server was pleasant, but he made me feel uncomfortable when he asked me who I voted for."}
{"text":"A solid chain Japanese restaurant with Ok service (2 stars) and good food (4 stars). I have had rolls, sushi, bento and ramen and all are well prepared and delicious. Unfortunately the service has consistently underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times! The food is good and so are the drinks! Try the strawberry sakerita...it's like drinking a smoothie until the alcohol finally hits! :P The only setback here is that it's always busy so usually there's a wait. But that's westgate for you on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Kabuki serves up edameme as a free appetizer for you to snack on. They have happy hour until 6:30p, and their food is good. I had the veggie roll (I'm not a fish person), and it was very good. The house Pinot Gris was also nice. The service was consisent, as I sat in the bar on thier couches with table.  I came alone before heading to the Gap, and relaxed playing on my phone..   They also have a sushi bar and regular dining including an outside patio. The restaurant seems very new, and clean. I will definitely go back. I did have on experience awhile back where I ordered the organic noodles (they were green); I would not recommend those unless your into their ingredients or have had them before, the flavors were VERY foriegn."}
{"text":"I ate here for the second time in the past year. I had fried tofu and asparagus rolls the first time. It was fine, the tofu was battered then fired. I preferred it without the batter. Second visit I had a salmon skin roll, OMG so yummy. I also had mozzarella and jalapeno wrapped in seaweed and deep fried in tempura... I wasn't sure of the seaweed and cheese combo. It was very tasty.. I've already decide on my next meal there, I'm having the salmon skin roll with miso soup and salad! My niece had a combo plate, she was happy with her meal as well! It was a lot of food. Another GREAT thing about this eatery they don't use styrofoam takeout containers."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've had dinner at this location.  On both occasions we stopped by during the weekend so we knew there would be some wait time.  On both occasion we were seated sooner than expected. The food is really good. I always have a California roll, Rainbow roll and Philadelphia roll these are a must. They offer of variety of different flavor teas which is awesome cause sometime I feel like raspberry and  sometimes I feel like mango. The mochi icream is delicious they drizzle chocolate on the plate and fresh fruit. The service is good I'm the kinda person who expects my drink to be filled without me having to wave down the waiteress or waiter. Needless to say throughout dinner we were checked on to make sure our drinks were topped off. My expections were met and I feel comfortable asking questions about the menu. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Went to Kabuki because of their spectacular happy hour (3-6pm) specials. $2.95 bottles of Sapporo? Who would have thought that was even a thing?! When we arrived, we were seated quickly. Our waiter took our order promptly (even though apologized for arriving to our table late because of a mix up of some sorts) and we had our beers, sake, and sushi out to us in a flash.  As fast as our food arrived, it disappeared. It tasted great and the presentation was spot-on. When we realized our plates were almost empty and our stomachs still weren't at maximum capacity, we ordered supplementary sushi. To our surprise, it appeared before us within 2 minutes (aka before the last pieces of sushi vanished from before us). Our conclusion was that either our waiter was a wizard or Kabuiki was just on its game. In both scenarios, we won - prompting me to give them a much deserved 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cool spot, nice decor, clean and good food. The service was good, things did take awhile to get, but it was not a big deal. The thing that is lacking is the selection of beer. They had 3: Miller Light, Kilt Lifter and Sapporo (Japanese Beer). I guess I can't really complain about the beer since it's a Japanese restaurant, but it still was disappointing. Overall it was a good time, I can see this place being a big date spot."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see the average for this place is only 3 stars. As a frequenter of many tempe sushi establishments, I think kabuki is a great spot for Japanese food. We went during happy hour with a group of 7, and even though nobody was drinking alcohol, we recieved excellent and fast service. Their happy hour is fantastic; they have really affordable appetizer and sushi rolls from 3-6, as well as drink specials (obviously). I also like that they have a vast menu, so even people who are not comfortable with sushi can still find something they will enjoy. For those who ARE comfortable with the raw, I like trying something new each time I go, and I haven't been disappointed yet. I also really like that they give you free edamame to start with - many places charge for it, although only a few dollars.   ***If you save room for dessert, be sure to try the Tempura Banana....omg. It's like heaven in your mouth! I would return for that alone. If Tempura Banana is available as a dessert option I almost always go for it, but this one is the best I've had anywhere.   Overall, I think Kabuki has a wonderful menu and great service. If you're in the tempe area, it's worth trying out!  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's pretty corporate/chain-y, and not as \"unique\" as some other places. But if you're new to the Japanese food scene, it's a safe (and delicious) bet!"}
{"text":"Decor is great. Food, was so so. Teriyaki chicken was tough. Tempura did not have a crispy texture like it had been reheated. Service was good adding a star."}
{"text":"When I read the reviews I was more excited to try this place out but once we got our sushi right after we ordered it was kind of weird we asked if it was freshly made out waitress said yes once we had it it was cold! Usually our Vegas rolls are fresh and warm these felt soggy like they had been sitting around. Our teriyaki plate had about 6 pieces of meat a bowl of rice and a plate full of salad if I would of said no salad because it seemed more salad than anything for 16$. First and last time trying this place."}
{"text":"The food is good and there's a wide selection, not just sushi. The service is fast and friendly.  I've been here multiple times and it's a great spot to get some dinner at before catching a movie at Town Square."}
{"text":"We came here with the intention of getting soup because we were sick and it was the nearest place from home.  With that said I can't rate all their food being that we didn't come here for the sushi. Walked in around 9pm with no host at the front area. Waited for about 5 minutes up front till someone came to be seated. Looked around and it seemed like a slow night 2 couples at the bar, 3 or 4 small groups around the dining area and about 2 to 4 servers. Waited for our server to take our drinks which was ridiculously long because he was having a conversation with a gentlemen who was looking to pay his bill and leave. After getting our drinks we waited for our server to return to take our which to our surprise never came back to do so. The hostess who sat us down actually came to take our order, a first that's every happened for me.  Ordered the spicy miso ramen which came with a side. A side of what? Soup or salad. Really?!? Not sure if it was because I'm sick at the moment or was grumpy because of the service but the food didn't have much flavor.  Midway through dinner my girlfriend needed some chili oil so she stopped our first server and from that point on he was our server once again. All in all the experience was a bad one. The service was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Located across H&M and Yogurtland, this restaurant is a great pitstop while shopping at Town Square.  Nice ambiance and superb customer service.  Make sure to call ahead especially on weekends to avoid the long wait.  Can't really remember the last time I dined at this place before this one.  First thing I noticed was the newly upgraded menu for 2014.  One of the standouts was the 'ankimo' (steamed monkfish liver on ponzu sauce and topped with spicy radish).  Considering of never having eaten fish liver before, I had to give this item a try.  Surprisingly, the flavor wasn't as irony as chicken liver or foie that one would expect.  In fact, it had a faint fishy taste but enough to remind you're eating fish entrails.   Other items on the new menu that seemed enticing include soy tako ebitaki (soy paper wrapped and lightly fried octopus and shrimp, topped with bonito flakes), spicy tuna on crispy rice and takosu (sliced octopus marinated in Japanese vinaigrette).  The restaurant also offers an extensive gluten-free and vegetarian menu.  Overall, Kabuki is definitely one of the better restaurants in the area.  Best time to check this place out is during Happy Hour which runs Mondays thru Fridays 3PM-6PM for great deals on food and alcoholic beverages.  They even have Reverse Happy Hour Mondays thru Thursdays 9PM-close and Sundays 8PM-close to pregame with your buddies before heading to one of the bars around the area."}
{"text":"This is an ok place..nothing super tasty or original..the only good thing on the menu is the kabuki roll special..that s about it"}
{"text":"Love this place for happy hour.  We usually sit at the bar area and our bartender Carlos is so attentive and wonderful.  The happy hour salmon is incredibly delicious, by far one of the my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas.  Be sure to try the spicy tuna salad; it's so yummy.  Its covered on a bed of mixed salad with shredded cucumbers and let me tell you, the tuna just melts in your mouth.  If you're still hungry also try the sea bass dish with brown rice, delicious."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Happy hour is nice. Sometimes the sushi is not as cold as I would like it to be but, in general, it is typically more than decent. I'd say Kona Grill is a 5 compared to Kubuki. I wish I could give it a 3.5, but I can't."}
{"text":"Had a terrific experience! The only down side was not being able to make a same day reservation, but I shouldn't have waited so long. The wait was only a few minutes once we were there (for a party of 6). Our server Andrew took excellent care of us as well as the whole support staff!! The food and selection was terrific!! We had eaten at other Kabuki's and had quality food but this time it was much better. We waited for nothing, had our drinks refilled promptly and even had extra help when we had a spill!! I highly recommend this Kabuki's for a very pleasant, quiet, non-casino type experience."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, they are very nice, professional. The food is pretty good as well. Though I'm probably not a fan of some of the other foods, but in terms of price, I probably won't be eating here often..."}
{"text":"Very cute place to grab a bite.  Went there last night with my friend for some Ramen (Tonkotsu) she got the seafood Udon. I extremely enjoyed my ramen and the extra little side salad that came with it. Very enjoyable atmosphere and Tivoli Village is just a cute place for a really romantic date night! I highly recommend it :) Go out there and enjoy it!  PS. The ramen is quite cheap, at less than $10/bowl, so feel free to add in some extras ($1 miso egg, $2 pork, $4 chicken breast)"}
{"text":"Was craving for some Japanese food and this place happens to be near by. Happy hour menu was very minimal (compare to other places )  However service was great! My husband had the bbq beef ribs and the combo fries rice. It was so good but the portion was smaller than I thought . A good place just to go once"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were delicious! We will definitely be coming back for more and our server was AMAZING.I will definitely request Huy as our server again. He went above and beyond for us and attended us extremely well. He definitely made our experience a ton better"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Good feel. Nice to chill even for a Sunday evening. I was on my way to the movies but, the idea of sushi was way better. Loved the cucumber mojito. I even went for two, maybe three.... Lol  Food in general was excellent. Portion sizes are on the larger side. I started with the Tokyo quesadilla. (An Asian version of the original) and to my surprise it was very good.  Then a selection of several rolls followed. Particularly recommend the Vegas roll, and spicy tuna.  Service in general good and location very nicely decorated. One odd feature \"pretty weird sperm looking lamps at the bar\" a bit distracting actually. Haha"}
{"text":"Get the Alaskan rolls with cream cheese :-) You are welcome! I always come here and everyone us so friendly and the food is always fresh. If you catch them during happy hour that's even better"}
{"text":"Food was good, but only thing amazing we ordered was the seasame chicken...otherwise I'd prefer to stick to our All you can eat favorite because the prices are outrageous and not worth the price difference.  Service was horribly slow and we kept having to remind them to bring us items.  They also served all the adults before the kids, which is unacceptable in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have gone to Kabuki for HH a several years back with my Japanese friends. The food was good, but the ambience was way too noisy... I don't know what's that about the restaurants in America... It is extremely difficult to find quiet or at least the BGM is not obstructing the conversation restaurants. Not like in Japan where it's much easier to find one!   Anyway, since last year I started picking up sushi & appetizers to go for dinner. I like their packaging, but their portions are rather small for the price."}
{"text":"I usually have a pretty good dining experience here. I never go for anything but happy hour. They have a solid HH menu with many options to choose from. My coworkers and I recently went for sushi and drinks. This visit left me feeling unimpressed and solidified my love for Kona Grill. The sushi was...OK. Nothing great this time around. The others in my party felt the same about their food. It took a good 15 minutes to get our check and another 15 to get our cards back after paying. Of course I was in a rush but even if I wasn't, that's a long time to wait to pay your server. Probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Good company, good food...good times. I don't get out much to the Town Square area but glad I made the effort. We were there at 11:30 am on a Friday, just before the lunch rush. Liked the atmosphere, the conversation, and of course the food. I actually ordered a cocktail, the mango cho-hi (dangerous); sweet and un-alcohol-y tasting, just like I like em. I chose only one appetizer; although looking at the menu I could have gone for many more. I will just have to make it out to an happy hour some day. I went with the shitake tofu, very tasty; tried the crab miso (tons of crab), and my main meal was the unagi don (unagi rice bowl with avocado slices) accompanied by a salad or miso soup. I chose the salad, of course, just having downed the big bowl of crab miso. I have to admit I found the avocado slices with my eel a bit odd at first but before the meal was over, liked the melding of the two flavors. The girls had much tinier appetites than myself; J chose the sake sangria along with niku kushiyaki and the mozzarella tempura (appetizers) and M went with the salmon teriyaki luncheon special. They, too, enjoyed the look and taste of their dishes. M has been there several times. We were all in a very happy place at the end of our lunch."}
{"text":"My rating scale:  (Only food and drink quality considered for rating. Usually worldwide comparison rating given unless otherwise noted in description)  1 Star - Terrible. The worst representation. Would not return.  2 Star - Bad. Below average representation. Would not return.  3 Star - Average. Decent showing. May return.  4 Star - Very good. Above average. Would return.  5 Star - Excellent. The best representation. Would definitely return.   First sushi/sashimi place I've tried out of many in Arizona that's not only edible but also fresh and delicious.   Should be 3.5 stars if considering worldwide rating based on slightly flavorless tuna tataki and odd consistency (perhaps authenticity) of squid in the fried calamari. Salmon sashimi, varied nigiri, cod, eel, even sake all very nice."}
{"text":"Consider the location. Obviously the prices are going to be a little higher. The sushi was very good and the experience was very pleasant. This is a quality place and quality food. My compliments to the chef and staff. Little pricey but clean and delicious!"}
{"text":"The decor is gorgeous, and the food is good. The drinks are pricey, go during happy hour for sure. The food came out really fast, but then I ordered an appetizer to go and it took so long that we nearly missed our plane. ??? That was my only reason for less than 5 stars. The service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"Sat for 30 mins without being greeted an then witnessed the waiter who's table it was.  Food was great service not so much!"}
{"text":"****Updated 2/9/18 from 3 stars to 1...reason being the manager that commented on my review told me the excuse for the food not being really tasty is because it's healthy & vegan...wow. No, sorry, dude- but I've been to plenty of vegan restaurants over the years and had amazing healthy flavorful vegan dishes. So not only will I not be trying something off your regular menu, I will now never be coming back. You are very offensive and unprofessional.     I recently had an early dinner here.  I had heard various reviews of their vegan sushi options for a long time and decided I wanted to try it for myself.  The usual sushi place I eat at close to home is a bit pricey and I just wanted to change up the flavors a bit.  Kabuki is a trendy place, busy, buzzing with activity, and since it is in town Square - not as casual as my neighborhood joint.  I did like the selection on their veggie sushi menu.I tried a few items like the tofu and crispy rice and some veggie sushi. While they were creative in the making, the flavors did not knock me off my seat. They were just so -so. So nothing I would crave specifically to drive here in order.  The service was good, the waiter was friendly enough and he made sure we had refills on our drinks. The sushi chefs were not very entertaining, seemed a bit young and not masters at their skill quite yet. That being said, if I happen to be in town square and I'm hungry I would possibly eat at kabuki again. But I certainly wouldn't drive out of my way to come eat here."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find in Tivoli ! Great food , excellent service and great atmosphere . Try the broiled mussels and the Baked Alaska roll - perfection . Calamari legs are divine . Happy hour deals are available every day . Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"We had our luncheon at Kabuki for 28 ladies.  The food and service were superb.  We asked for separate checks and they were so accommodating.  Supatra our waitress did an awesome job handling such a large group.  Thanks so much Kabuki!"}
{"text":"Kabuki never disappoints. Brought my best friends here many times. The food and ambience are great! Also tried their happy hours, and they have very reasonable prices. The staff are great and accommodating. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Japanese food and drinks. The restaurant is also located in Town Square, which is a decent place - all the more good reason to eat til you're full and fancy a nice stroll afterwards with your friends, family, or significant other. Kabuki will work for casual, semi-formal, and formal dates."}
{"text":"came back  again to get the cilantro alborcore roll, and decided to order the spicy crispy rice  as well. lets just say this place can care less about their appeal to customers.    please watch the video posted....   they gave me raw rice on what was supposed to be crispy roll.... horrible!!@  second time to mess up my order won't be coming back here, ever!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Visited at 3:30pm on A Saturday. Not busy at first but slowly drew some large parties. Ordered the agedashi (fried) tofu, spicy miso soup, and spicy chicken. Longer than normal wait for the tofu but I was definitely hungry by that time. I was disappointed to say the least. It looked appetizing but the tofu itself was clammy and slimy. The sauce itself was slimy...running off my chopsticks like runny egg whites. The other fare came out about 10 minutes later...again excited. The spicy chicken looked similar to the picture except for one big difference...it sat in it's own pool of oil. At first I thought maybe it was juice, but when I pushed it against the plate and ducked my napkin in, it was all chili oil. A LOT of chili oil. The food wasn't even that spicy. I picked off the top since there was no flavor in the oil other than smoked chili...80% was left on the plate. The spicy miso soup was my last hope but it too was gummy and oily. I think anything labeled \"spicy\" just means they use chili oil..not that they put fresh spices or anything else. My noodles were overdone and the only flavor was the red chili oil glazing the top of the miso. Maybe the sushi is better? Maybe food that is not spicy so its not swimming in oil?"}
{"text":"Good...not great, but good. Place is clean, service was great, but food could have been better. Spicy miso ramen lacked any flavor minus the mild spice. The hibachi rice was spongy and lacking. The agedashi tofu was on point....as soon as I removed the topping which smelled like bad fish. It was overwhelming."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this place considering the reviews, but I found it great.  The menu is vast and offers numerous sushimi and sushi rolls -- including two full pages of specialty rolls (8 pieces). The service is great; very kind and swift. They bring you a free bowl of edameme, too! Winning... and they had $4 Japanese bar on draft, which was much better than your run of the mill Bud Light or Miller Lite.  OK, the good stuff: the sushi. We all got it. I opted for the scallop roll (6 pieces), and it was awesome. The scallops are huge! It was mixed with cream cheese and really hit the spot. The best part was the lava roll: salmon, cream cheese, spicy tuna, deep-fried jalapeño, sweet sambal sauce. One of THE BEST sushi rolls I ever had. The \"lava\" is actually in the middle of the rolls, so forget the soy sauce and douse them in the sambal sauce. The jalapenos add flavor, but the sweet sauce makes it so it's not spicy. Highly recommend.  All in all the place is intimate, has dim lighting, some TVs by the sushi bar, lots of seating and is in a nice location off the strip. Glad I tried it on my travels."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of sushi places in vegas and this is definitely the best! It's not expensive, food is great and service usually good as well. I go there every week. Today I went to a really awful place (kaizen in Henderson) so I decided to leave a great review here to make sure kabuki is appreciated!!!:D great food!"}
{"text":"The first thing we noticed when we arrived was a strange smell. It was almost as if a sewer had leaked the night before but they still opened for business the next day. It was an interesting [non-food] odor. Anyways, we decided to eat in the bar area. The drinks were tasty and strong. Our bartender was very nice and attentive. Our server was also very attentive and kind. The sushi was just OK. The rice seemed a little to mushy in all of the rolls. Not sure if it was just bad batch or if it's always like this. Husband and I decided that this was not the place for us and we will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Our server Spencer was awesome the food is always great I love the spicy miso soup and the California roll. This is always one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We came here at the end of happy hour for dinner. The happy hour menu had a big selection at decent prices. Our server was great, attentive, friendly and even let us put in a couple rolls a few minutes after happy hour had ended. So I'd give the service and menu 4/5 stars easily. Unfortunately the meal itself was underwhelming. The sushi came out kind of room temperature, which is a little disconcerting when eating raw fish. We also got an order of beef yakisoba. The beef was tough, chewy and I could taste that it had been cooked on a gas grill that was too hot. I swear it tasted like what propane/gas grills smell like. Weird. Over all I would probably come back for drinks and apps on happy hour but unfortunately that's about it."}
{"text":"First the pros: nice location, good ambiance, fresh fish, and excellent service. We were very well taken care of, and the waitstaff were very attentive. Now... that said, the cons? Well, for one, if a roll is too big to fit in my mouth, that's not a plus. It makes it messy to eat and it doesn't let me get a good blend of the flavors. It's bad etiquette and poor presentation. I don't fault the staff for that, as they're preparing to specifications and to the expectations of people who frequent from the strip - go big or go home.  The rolls weren't very flavorful and used the same two sauces repeatedly. Can I get some eel or ponzu sauce? The gyoza were oddly dry. I'll take the 'chase down your waitress' service in Chinatown to get good, authentic sushi. Leave the huge piles of rice that can't fit my mouth for the tourists. And my friend who was with me said that her iced tea tasted like Mio... no good. I'd give it a pass. Not terrible for a quick bite, but if you want something authentic, take off your tophat and monocle and walk into an off-strip dive."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in my experience here. My husband and I went for the first time to have a nice meal together. I called ahead since I have a milk and beef allergy to make sure that they would be able to accommodate this, and the lady assured me that it wouldn't be a problem. However, the kitchen staff ended up refusing to swap the beef for chicken in the dish I wanted. The waiter told me the kitchen staff said it wouldn't pair well together and I wouldn't like it, but that should be my choice. In the end, it didn't matter because half of our food was awful anyways. My husband got a tuna roll and the rice was so sticky that it hurt his jaw to chew it. He didn't even eat half of it. I ordered the sesame chicken and it was dry, bland, and chewy. The dipping sauce was okay, but nothing special, and wasn't enough to overcome the awful chicken. I barely ate any at all. At first service was good, but then got pretty slow and it took quite a while to get a second round of drinks. The upside was the pork belly appetizer, it was tasty. And my husband also liked the beef yakisoba. But with half the food being pretty much inedible, limited ability to accommodate food allergies, and slow service, definitely NOT worth it for how much the food costs. We will not return."}
{"text":"COME HERE DURING HAPPY HOUR!! Sat at the bar to get waited on by a lovely bartender named Ellen. She was very attentive, on point, and made great suggestions on what to order off of their happy hour menu. She made everything seem so good that by the end of my meal I realized I ordered almost everything on the happy hour menu!  Fried Calamari Sesame Chicken Philly Roll Shrimp Temp Roll Spicy Tuna Rose Roll  Everything was very tasty and really CHEAP! Next time I came to Vegas I'll definitely come by here. Not only for the good happy hour, but for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but I'm not thrilled with the service. Our appetizer didn't come until after our entrees. It took over 5 minutes to get a refill of water. The restaurant wasn't even half full, I'd hate to be here on a busy night. I would try it again and I would absolutely get takeout."}
{"text":"My mom came down to visits me from California and we went there for dinner, anyways the food we ordered was great and overall we had a lovely and sweet waitress. I suggest for an appetizer order the lobster dynamite it is quite tasty. We went on a friday around 7 pm, mind you that it is quite busy so we had to wait for thirty minutes, but it was worth the wait time goes by so fast. Overall my mother, my two friends, and I had a good time there. I will definitely come there again"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch with some friends after watching a movie. The location was very convenient while exiting the movies. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly.   Our waiter didn't really give us the time of day and just shoved menus in our face and not a word after that. He took our food and drink orders and asked us if we cared what came out first. This really made things awkward while eating.   I ordered the jidori chicken ramen, with a spicy tuna roll on the side. The ramen was very bland, I have had more flavor in a cup of noodles. I finally had to ask them to bring Sriracha chili sauce out. The tuna was decent but lacking in the flavor department aswell. My fiance ordered the spicy tuna salad, it was basically a spoon fill of spicy tuna sushi roll filling scooped on a bed of lettuce. Our friends both ordered the spicy tuna crunch roll they said it was decent for the price.   I won't be coming back here even for their decently priced happy hour specials. It's worth a try if you need a sushi fix while wondering town square. I wouldn't travel across town just for the food they offer."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant right after the Fiesta Bowl when all of the restaurants were packed. We were seated at the sushi bar and the service was EXCELLENT! I expected a long wait and so-so food and was pleasantly surprised. We never waited for a drink and food was served within 10-15 minutes. Sashimi and rolls did not disappoint. Will definitely return here when we are back in town."}
{"text":"MMMMM went here for the first time to have some happy hour with my favoritest person ever! She goes here all the time! Me on the other hand has never seen Westgate before hmm 9 pm and the only thing I usually order is a nice strong drink. I was rather excited. I see her at the top of the escalator, just like those cheesy movies we hug when I reach her. We sit at the bar...first thing I notice is a really bad smell. It wasn't her haha I gave her a hug and it was fine. It wasn't me, I smelt like perfume. Hmmm the bartender in me came back...so I smelt the menu. EWWWWWW it was cleaned with a rag from the sanitizer bucket probaly, but it has not been switched out for a while. I had to wash my hands. I ordered a kirin and a spicy tuna salad. Everything tasted amazing...my bill was a lovely 8 bucks. I left stuffed and satisfied with the food...but I could not get the smell of those menus out of my nose!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I never have bad service here. Ly was such a great waiter! Very accommodating and good at filling waters for my table! The food came out really fast and every taste very good. Came here around 3:30 on a Friday and happy hour just barely started. Their happy hour menu have great options! Definitely recommend this place to anyone and remember to ask for Ly is he's working!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed eating at Kabuki.  I always order the salmon skin rolls (my typical order).  Last night I ordered The Kabuki Roll, which is an assortment of sushi and I was pleasantly surprised.  The dish's description says that they are spicy crunch rolls, and I am not a fan of spicy sushi, but there were only a couple pieces that were spicy.  (Ate those first!)   I would definitely order the Kabuki Roll again.  Also, I ordered the onigiri, which was also good.   I have also ordered the seafood udon in the past. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great location in Town Square Mall. Good lunch prices. The rolls are also a fair price! We really love the sukiyaki, ramen and any noodle. You always get plenty of food!"}
{"text":"Originally a group of friends and I were planning on doing Korean BBQ, but changed our minds when we saw the Kabuki menu. Happy Hour deals are phenomenal! We were seated right away, as it was early afternoon. I usually opt in for Ramen or Sushi, but went out on a whim and tried their Beer Sukiyaki, and OMG was it devine. We had just come from volunteering all morning and the meal most definitely hit the spot. Friends got Ramen and Salmon, both looked great, but I was extremely content with my meal! Great value and awesome staff. Dustin was our server and awesome at answering all our questions!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant in Town Square.  The sushi was fresh, came out fast, and was reasonably priced.    If you like points and discounts, they participate in Yelp Checkin, Open Table, Happy Hour from 3-6, and if you are an LVAC Member, you get 15% off your bill.  I will 110% be going back to Kabuki."}
{"text":"Well now, Kabuki. You just got better!  I've eaten at Kabuki probably about 4 or 5 times.  Usually I order some sort of Happy Hour sushi and a couple Saporos cuz that's how I roll.  This time, it wasn't HH, so I ventured to the lunch menu.  If you know me at all from Yelp, then you know I quest for two things. Nachos and ramen.  This place had ramen. I got it.  Funny thing is, the waiter kept trying to get me to change my mind.  It was odd. \"Sir, you know this is a soup. Not many people realize that\"... \"I'll put in your order, but let me know if you change your mind\"... \"Not many people like the flavor of the broth, do you want me to bring you our 7 spice to add to it?\"... I was scared to eat it before I even saw it!!!  Needless to say, when it came, I taste tested with him standing there and he seemed surprised that I thought it was tasty. Don't doubt a true ramen fan, sir. Do not! Anywho... Melissa got the teriyaki chicken, and I nibbled a little off of it (it was good)...  a 3-star performance, but a 4-star ramen dish. I DO wish I could get my hands on some of that 7 spice though. It was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  They have a great selection of traditional Japanese dishes and Sushi.  At lunch time, they have lower-priced specials for about $10 that include an entree such as teriyaki chicken with tempura vegetables and shrimp, miso soup and a salad.  It is my favorite place to go for special occasions!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for sushi for as long as I can remember. I went here for the first time on my boyfriend and I's first date, and now 3 years later, it is one of the only places we go for sushi. They have the best spicy tuna I have ever had - it is small squares of tuna in spicy sauce, not that mushy spicy tuna mixture you get at places like RA.   Everything I have had is just amazing. They have a happy hour AND a reverse happy hour almost every day, so it's impossible not to get great food for a great deal. If you're in the Tempe area and looking for sushi, THIS is where you should go.   + be sure to try the dynamite roll, it is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, some items slightly overpriced, but mostly because of the location. The sushi is very fresh, maybe not the best one I have ever tried, but definitely flavorful and enjoyable. They serve wonderful spicy seafood udon pasta and yaki soba. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"i've been going back and forth between 3 or 4 stars for a couple of days now. what finally made me decide to go with 4 stars was the service.  the hubby and i brought his mom, dad, sis and nieces here for dinner. what we didn't realize until after we sat down and got our menus was that it was a chain restaurant with locations in california, arizona and nevada. not a huge chain, but a chain nonetheless and, boy, am i not a fan of chain restaurants. to my surprise, kabuki serves up some decent fare for a chain restaurant. believe me, i was worried.  we ordered quite a bit of food and our bill was still pretty reasonable. it was likely because we ordered a few things from their reverse happy hour menu which takes place everyday after 9pm except sundays where it starts at 8pm. they also have a regular happy hour from 5pm-8pm.  they definitely don't skimp on portions here. even the appetizer portions are huge! if i had known that we were going to get cheesecake factory sized portions, i would not have ordered so much! we ordered the firecracker, mixed tempura, yellowtail carpaccio, soft shell crab, sesame chicken, pear endive salad, salmon skin salad, omakase special, albacore crunch roll, rose roll, mediterranean sea bass, tempura udon, slamon sashimi and the following nigiri - aji, kaibashira, 2 anago, 2 toro, amaebi, 2 hamachi toro and aburi kaibashira.  a few downers: there was far too much rice on the nigiri pieces. they serve you huge slices of fish but the rice is equivalent. i was told that you can request less rice so i will try that next time because i only ate about 1/8 of the rice that they gave with each piece. the fish appeared fresh and everything was very tasty. there's nothing fancy about the sushi here. i don't use wasabi and soy because it tends to drown out the flavor of the fish. i eat it how it's served and i'm used to sushi chefs that use some sort of condiment, sauce or aged soy to enhance the flavor of the fish but they don't do that here. they could certainly improve on their ginger as well. albeit, it wasn't the pink stuff, which is great, but it didn't have the consistency or spiciness that i've become accustomed to.  our server, however, was phenomenal. she was kind, attentive and very patient even after they closed and we were still eating. i asked to have some yuzu squeezed on my scallop and she wasn't sure if the chefs could do that but when she brought our sushi order out, she also brought a small dish with yuzu juice in it and asked me if it was what i wanted. heck yeah! i was ecstatic! she definitely went out of her way. i've found that to be few and far between lately.  it's not on my list of \"go-to\" spots but i would dine here again. now that i know how huge the portions are, i'll take it easier the next time around."}
{"text":"While their selection is full of American-friendly versions of Japanese and other Asian food, they still have a some good traditional dishes. We try to sit at the sushi bar each time and always have great service. I'm a big fan of amaebi nigiri - don't know where they get theirs from but it always tastes perfect. The ochazuke is a little heavy on the broth side, but still light and lovely. My husband is a fan of the tonkatsu and soboro bowl, they always hit the spot."}
{"text":"Love this place, sushi is great quality and the service is always on point! The reverse happy is a total bargain and love the vegan menu! The area the restaurant sits in is very elegant and quiet. Please try them out and cheers with one of their Saki sangria's!!"}
{"text":"We came in for my friend's 30th birthday party Jose took care of us it was amazing Jose was fantastic could not have asked for a better server the rest of the staff came and helped out they were great as well food could have been better"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Convenient location.  Hearty servings too. I started with the calamari. The dish was very bland; not tasty at all. The chicken teriyaki was great! It came with a delicious salad and a side of brown or white rice. Service was fast and the waitress was pleasant. The place wasn't crowded on this Tuesday evening. Do it was relatively quiet, with dim lighting. Good place to go for date night. I will definitely go back to try the sushi...just wasn't in the mood for it on this day."}
{"text":"I had never tried Sushi before and this was my very first tasting with a friend. It was amazing! I love the atmosphere and the people. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Kabuki yesterday (Friday) night and thought the food and experience was just \"ok\". My salad was dry without hardly any dressing, my soup was bowl was less than half way filled and served and my chicken was dry. Nonetheless, the food was edible but certainly not great. As for the experience, we had some students selling candy come up and pester our table. Also, it took a while to get our server to refill water, bring us the check, etc. I imagine this is because it was a busy Friday night, but still certainly frustrating."}
{"text":"I came here during happy hour and surprisingly it was dead. Our party of three and another family were the only people there. We were seated promptly however the service was terrible. It was disappointing considering the waitress should have taken advantage of the slow business. She was also extremely shy and she rarely checked up on us. Usually I wouldn't mind, but my water was running out and it's hot in Vegas during the summer and I was dry as a bone. I started stealing my sister's water. Also the waitress wasn't available and we had to flag down another waiter to bring us plates. For the terrible service I would have only given this place three stars, but I came here another time before with a big group of my friends and we were served by a waitress named Sara and she was absolutely amazing! She always wore a smile on her face and checked up on our big party. Everyone was impressed.  As for the food the sushi is always fresh and great! I got the spicy tuna which was only $3.95 for 6 rolls. Not bad at all! Also the rose roll and Vegas roll are a must! Additionally I got the spicy miso ramen which is not on the happy hour menu, but for $8.95 it comes with a big bowl of ramen and a side of salad which tasted incredible (: I will be back and hopefully get a more fun, upbeat server that doesn't give off the vibe of hating her job."}
{"text":"Kabuki was great....A lovely little middle-of-the-afternoon oasis found in Tempe Marketplace!  I scoped out the menu had some some sushi for happy hour, including some rare beef sashimi, some unusual and unique rolls and complimentary edamame.  Although I did not dine here for a full meal, I feel justified in expressing my enjoyment of their happy hour.  The tiny bar was cozy and the service was good.  The happy hour prices were enticing and I would definitely return for it:)  Although for my personal taste the ambiance of Kabuki seemed a little too corporate for me I definitely would return for their happy hour and maybe to sample other menu items.  I will keep you posted on my next visit:)"}
{"text":"Oh goodness where do I start. First the tables were sticky and gross. We asked if that was normal and we were told all of them are. Then the chopsticks were so cheap that they gave me a splinter. Then a salad came out that was included in the meal and the lettuce was brown and had no dressing on it. The potstickers weren't too terrible. The pork belly was poorly cooled and had no flavor at all. Then the waiter forgot about the sushi we ordered which was terrible when it finally didn't came. I will definitely never go back to Kabuki!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent. Usually get the boat for its variety and value. Staff is friendly and service is rather quick. When I don't want to take a risk with a place to eat I can easily come here and be satisfied. Place can get kinda busy when there's a game going on."}
{"text":"Great Japanese cuisine. It's reasonable and the food is really good. I always get the Spicy Seafood Udon Noodles and the Philadelphia Roll . I just wish there were a little more options for happy hour and lunch."}
{"text":"I went here last night after my shift at a retailer in Tempe Marketplace. I was greeted and seated promptly. However, I sat at my booth for 15 minutes without being spoken to by a waiter, or having water brought to me. I got up and went to the hostess stand and told her I had not been greeted or serviced and she looked horrified and said she would sent the waiter over. Another 5 minutes pass and finally a waiter comes to my booth. He is very abrasive and acts like he's annoyed. Imagine how infuriated I was when I realized that this was the same guy who had walked right past me 10+ times without saying a word and happily helped the booth behind me. Service was prompt after my tongue lashing. A few moments later I spilled my water :) There was no sign of my waiter for abt 10 minutes. I get up and ask the hostess for napkins and another waitress assisted me and was super nice. I asked for the manager at that point. The manager proceeded to try and justify the poor service, but acknowledged there was no excuse. She said the server admitted he forgot about me (bull) and would have him apologize. She then says I got the \"Employee Discount\" on my bill. I told her she could keep it; I just wanted her aware of the poor service and how bad it made the establishment look. This was my first visit and quite possibly my last. It's a shame, because the food was great, but the service was absolutely horrid."}
{"text":"My wife and I stoped for dinner when we arrived in town, I ordered the garlic chili salmon poki bowl awesome flavor... if you order put the sauce on top and mix amazing also the 6 piece salmon roll is simple but good.  My wife ordered the seafood Udon noodle soups large bowl and full of flavor.  Ordered the edamame it was cold used to it being warm like it just came out of the boiling pot of water.  Was a wonderful dinner and the waiters and hostess very nice and professional.  A must try and they have a military discount"}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken and sushi. The drinks are amazing. There is always kind service and the setting is beautiful and romantic."}
{"text":"Some cooked. Some raw. Choice is always friendly staff. Good food. Lots of parking. Clean. Easy to find."}
{"text":"This was a very good experience. The service was a very oblivious and got our order wrong. That is the only reason why this amazing place did not get a full 5 stars.  I ended up getting the nigiri platter and he shrimp fried rice. Very generous portions. Be sure to bring your appetite.  Great flavor combinations. Over all a good experience."}
{"text":"Great server! So funny and attentive. Best avocado rolls then any other sushi places I ve eaten at. I  Kabuki"}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday afternoon lunch. I eat gluten free and they have a separate gluten free menu as well as gluten free soy sauce. The waiter was very knowledgable on gluten free options. They also have an extensive amount of vegetarian options.   The service here was great. The food was also good, I gave only 4 stars instead of 5 because the food didn't stand out to me any more than other sushi places I've been. I ordered the ramen veggie soup and a Philadelphia roll. The food came out rather quickly. There is a free edamame appetizer with any sushi order which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour at townsquare. Jeff was really attentive and gave great customer service. Will definitely be coming here again :) my favorite HH item is the asparagus salmon roll!"}
{"text":"This place has huge, delicious rolls for the price with quality maintained. There is also a plethora of options/specialty rolls (my absolute favorite being the Sunkissed roll) that don't all contain cream cheese and tempura like most other sushi places. You also have the option to sub in brown rice, which is nice when I'm in the mood for that. Edamame also always comes free with sushi, yum!  I signed up for their loyalty card so basically every $500 you spend, you get a $25 gift certificate (can't use it during happy hour).  This is one of my favorite places for sushi. I can't say much for the regular menu having only eating an actual dinner entree once (which was still delicious).  Only problems I have with this place is that it's always FREEZING inside and, while they have HH and reverse HH, almost non of the rolls I want to eat are listed."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. My favorite is the Dragon Roll that comes with a very large piece of eel on top. They always make the dragon roll with an intricate design so it has a face made out of octopus tentacles. I always think it's amusing. I had to take one star away because I have noticed a decline in the food quality in some of my other favorite rolls. The Alaskan Roll is smothered in like warm mayonnaise which is a. It unsettling. No matter how busy it is I always find myself flagging down my server or hostess for assistance with the check or for a refill on my green tea. Our server Pearl is always positive and happy to see us."}
{"text":"Trevor was an amazing waiter, very friendly. This place is nice and big, the A.C. is at a perfect temperature too, that's a plus. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is great as usual! We go there all the time and the last time which was yesterday we had the best waitress, her name is Jade she was the only one who gave us a bunch of offers and specials that the restaurant have, she was very helpful. I think they need more of Jade to let the customers know what kabuki really have and be successful."}
{"text":"After going to many sushi restaurants around the Valley nowhere comes close to the quality of fish at Kabuki for their phenomenal price. I always start with the Kabuli roll and then enjoy whatever else my friends have a craving for."}
{"text":"This place was a little adventurous for me. The extent of my taste for sushi was an occasional craving for gas station California Rolls. Haha! Just kidding. More like supermarket sushi. I usually don't venture too far from what I'm sued to.  But I was with my wife and a couple of new friends who I decided to put my faith in. I was a little nervous, but when the sushi came I was fixin' to get my dinner on!   No, I'm not from Texas.   It was great! Of course, I loved the Vegas Roll. That's probably as white bread as you can get with sushi, and I was loving it. The Lobster Roll was good, but I wasn't a big fan of the Spicy Tuna.   Raw fish + smelt eggs = happy Colt.   I was surprised! The place was pretty awesome too. I liked the set up. Dim lighting. Loads of people. Nice servers.   I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the the entertainment book guide, we got this place for our first night in Vegas.  Food was great  and service was sweet."}
{"text":"I've came here before and the food was fine but today my chicken was weird and pink and smelled like wet dog from far away I found out what the smell was and it was their teriyaki chicken I didn't want to be rude and say anything but I won't be coming back the wet dog smell scared me and I didn't even get to enjoy my meal"}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened at Tempe Marketplace. It's in my neighborhood, food has always been consistent..not stellar but over time we identified the things we felt they did best. I had a really poor meal there about a year ago and didn't return until this June..thinking I'd give it another try. New menu was promising, brought vegan relatives, lots of choices but it didn't take long for things to go south. They got the alcohol order wrong- and only three of us ordered drinks- we ordered appetizers and asked that they bring them first. A half an hour later ( with a toddler who wasn't happy not having food quickly- thus the appetizers ) our food arrived- ALL of it. We asked our server several times about the appetizers and were told she would check on it and then disappear for 15 more minutes. The worst part of a bad meal was a long dark hair on the tofu steak plate of my grandsons plate! After 5 minutes trying to flag the server the manager came over and agreed to comp the meal and replace it but our 2 year old was having none of it..we are at the 40 minute mark by then. I had ordered the same thing and gave him mine. I had already made a reservation for Fathers Day at this point. We did return..hubby and I and the scenario was repeated minus the hair. Drink orders wrong again and had to go back which took another ten minutes..20 minutes to even get a drink at 6pm..food was disappointing EXCEPT for the awesome spider roll. Everything else was screwed up..the server told me what came on the black cod plate and it didn't arrive that way. The Fathers Day special was a lot of food but some things were hot and others cold when they should have been hot. Sorry Kabuki..I want to love you but have spend $250 there in June and wish I had spent it someplace else!"}
{"text":"The location is nice. Has a outside patio area w/umbrellas to watch the water fountains dance every hour. The servers are accommodating once they come to your table. Your best bet is going there Happy Hour that's Monday thru Friday from 3-6p. You get a good amount for your money for drinks and actual sushi. If you're expecting blow away great tasting fresh sushi, probably not the place. But it is tasty and not bad. Try the Rose Roll, (a little spicy) and the Volcano,(baked salmon)."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here about  2 months ago when going to a football game.  Would go back again for sure but got to try all the places in that area!  The service was good and the food served very nice."}
{"text":"Always a great meal, never disappointing...the atmosphere is quiet, comfortable..the sushi chefs always prepare excellent rolls with just the right proportions of rice to fish. Excellent experience every time!"}
{"text":"I've been here for a couple of happy hours. I agree with Charles R - no need to pay full price (especially as the regular prices are a bit hight) and it is better than Ra.  Definitely not the best sushi I've had in town, but the drinks are good (cucumber mojito!) and the place is set up well for happy hour groups.  The servers I have encountered are all VERY patient with people coming and going within the group and individual checks for everyone.  Knowing what a pain that is, I really appreciate how willingly they do it.  For good sushi, I will stick with Yasu or Sakana.  For happy hour, this is a great place - and the Tempe Marketplace location is convenient to several friends."}
{"text":"On my never-ending search for good Japanese food, Kabuki popped up on my Yelp list tonight. We walked in at 9:00 (they close at 10 on weekdays) and were greeted at the door by Hana. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was relaxed and modern. One star for atmosphere.  Our waiter was Shelby, and he was very attentive and friendly...definitely took care of my boyfriend and I. He swung by to check on us regularly, which was nice because we never had to find him. One star for wonderful service.   Just a heads up, their menu is very extensive. Be prepared to battle indecisiveness, because you'll want to eat everything.   Now, the food. I REALLY wanted to give this another star, but my chirashi just wasn't what I was expecting. The sashimi was alright but the pieces were small, as were the ones in my boyfriend's teriyaki chicken/ sashimi teishoku. I understand that fish is not cheap, but if you are going to charge $17 for a bowl, it would be nice to have the portion sized accordingly. I'm from Hawaii where EVERYTHING is expensive, and I've had a cheaper yet more abundant chirashi there. However, my bf's meal was priced at $19.99 and came with a salad, tempura, bowl of rice, teri chicken, sashimi, and miso soup. That's a lot of food for one dinner, so maybe I just have to try other things on the menu.   On the plus side, the chicken karaage appetizer was yummy, and all the plates were pretty. For dessert we had green tea mochi ice cream, which was also a little pricey for the two pieces it came with, but the ice cream's flavor was light and floral and rounded out the meal well. A third star for these points.   Overall, not quite the authentic Japanese food I was craving, but there are a lot of fusion items and a vegetarian/gluten free menu that I'd like to try, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We always stop by this location for great sushi and service during each visit to the Glendale area.  The manager, Huy, is very attentive and welcoming to the guests.  We typically order a lot of sushi and a bowl of udon for dinner.  We placed the same order again last night and realized we only had 30 min prior to the start of the Hockey game next door.  Our server was able to get our order through and we were able to finish our meal with 10 min left.     We will definitely be back and enjoy the great food."}
{"text":"Overall this place was dissapointing. It looks great inside, very hopping place. The food on the other hand was underwhelming.    Portions were small, prices were high and overall quality was mediocre.  They had a dragon roll that was $17 that's outrageous.  I had a bowl of sashimi with 10 cuts of fish... the pieces were very small and the design of the bowl made eating it difficult. Even the soba with cold dipping sauce was $8 and was maybe 1 cup of soba.   The staff was friendly and on the ball which is always a plus but there is much better sushi for the prices this place was charging. Wouldn't bother returning."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and they serve you quickly. They have the best sushi I've ever had! The only thing I dislike is that the servers can't answer my questions about the food. But, this won't stop me from returning because the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay sushi selection and quality. Good service and great prices. Frequent this location once every few months. The bar is a nice set up and the patios are cozy at night."}
{"text":"I worked an event in Tempe Marketplace for 12 hours and on both of my breaks I went to Kabuki for my meals. The lunch special was a really good deal for all the food you get; I ordered the beef sukiyaki. Huge bowl! For my second 'meal' I had less time so I just ordered take out, the hibachi rice. Really yummy and filled me up for the time being. Very nice server too, Zach - thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally a local that visits the touristy places to eat and drink because they're extremely overpriced and the quality is meh.  However, my fried had a crappy day at work and wanted to get some cocktails and sushi so she suggested Kabuki's at Town Square.  I met her there, and she had waiting I think 15 minutes or so for a table.  Our server, Justin, was very attentive and friendly, giving us time to read over the menus and decide what we wanted.  We went with the yellowtail carpaccio to start and it was delicious!  I loved the sauce. Next up was the Baja roll which was a spicy California roll topped with tomato salsa. Sounds really crazy, but it was really really good!  I'm not a huge fan of crab, but it was very tasty and different.  Finally we ordered the lotus on fire roll and it was good. I was hoping to get the spicy tuna crunch roll, but maybe next time.  I'd definitely eat here again if I'm in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"Sigh. Kabuki. Wish you were better to me. 30 minute wait for 2. Got seated on a small table. Ordered garlic edemame which is served with a fried red chili ( not spicy). It was good. Ordered calamari.... eh. Had better. It wasn't crispy. Bf ordered the usual.. California rolls which he liked. He also ordered a Vegas roll. He wasn't too fond of the Vegas roll. I ordered a lobster roll.. sigh. The lobster roll is the California roll jus with pieces of lobster on top... saddest thing ever. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I can't give enough praise for this restaurant and the staff.  My birthday party had to make a restaurant switch after waiting 2 hours at Gen Korean next door (don't go there they are rude/ and have bad business practices).   After being moved to the back of the wait list for 2 hours I had enough.  My party of 23 people went to Kabuki with (20 minutes left to close).  The manager and her staff did not turn us away.  She kindly made an area for us, and sat us pretty promptly. While we waited the manager comped appetizers for us of edamame and dumplings to make up to us for having such a bad situation happen to me on my birthday. SO KIND AND CONSIDERATE.  The wait staff got our drink orders and our food out to us really fast. My husband and i and two others  got the dream platter to share. it was SOOOOOOOOOOO Good.  My other friends also enjoyed their meals.    We did not feel rushed out of the restaurant but did respect that the waiters/ kitchen staff, and manager stayed later to help us.   I HIGHLY recommend and would definitely go back.  A+++ for Kabuki on my birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Meh... I am not a fan. I went here for happy hour one time, and I was beyond disappointed. They must've had their D list chefs working... Cuz my food was GROSS. I couldn't even finish it. Kinda sucks spending that much money on nasty sushi."}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi.  Off the hook bathrooms... I had a great buzz from the cold sake and beer I drank, but oh my, the crooked doorways and slanted walls get you spinning!    The uni was some of the best I have ever had, the toro was top notch, and my only complaint was the lack of fresh wasabi.  Come on sushi places... quit it with the play-dough powder mix and get the fresh stuff... charge $2 if you need to, we'll pay for it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Kabuki! I've been here countless times since my ASU days (go SunDevils!) and each time I've always left a satisfied customer. My fiance is obsessed with sushi and he's had several good rolls from Kabuki. I'm more of a Chicken Teryiaki kind of girl and they have great lunch specials for around 10 bucks that include the entree plus rice and salad. Not to mention the edamame the friendly server will place on your table while you wait for your food. This place is great for lunch breaks, dates and catching up with your friends which I had fun doing tonight. :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I had the spicy seafood noodles and my husband the carnivore had the beef ribs with brown rice. We also had the dynamite roll as a starter and a really good salad with a ginger dressing that was absolutely delicious. I had come her before with a girl friend for the first time and had some tempura dish that was delicious too and wanted to come back with my husband. I would recommend it if you like Japanese style noodle dishes and sushi, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with friends and we absolutely love it!  We hit a couple of snags such what to order but every waiter we have had was really helpful and understanding of one of my friend's skepticism about the food."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with their food.  The sushi were wide in circumference and thinly sliced.  That combo is just a disaster waiting to fall apart when you pick them up with your chopsticks.  After eating a few pieces, we finally said something to the waiter.  We even showed her what happens when you pick it up!!! \"Maybe the rice wasn't made correctly?? Or made not tight enough??\"  She looked at us as if we were crazy!  So the best thing she could do for us was to remake \"one roll\" b/c the other rolls were half way eaten.    I'm not sure if was due to the crazy, hectic Valentine's holiday or if that's just the way they make some of their rolls ??  I was so caught up in picking up the sushi in pieces that I lost focus on quality and taste of the fish :/    I've been to many sushi places in town, and I'll have to say - I've had better...."}
{"text":"What a ripoff! After I paid the bill I felt robbed...  We went here only because the other places in the mall were packed and this was empty - what a huge mistake!  First of all, the restaurant was quite empty. It took them at least 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order. We weren't given any beverages at this point either. Many waitresses passed by us doing nothing.  The menu was ridiculously expensive - $15.50 for the roll we ordered (sorry, forgot the name, but it sucked!) - we had to pay $1 extra for spicy mayo, which they gave quite a bit in a small dish.  We also ordered the lunch \"Winterlicious\" menu. 3 set course for $15  Appetizer - we chose Gyoza - it was okay.  Main - Maki set - Avocado, Salmon, and Tuna roll (I think around 18 pieces which was a pretty decent price, however, they were tasteless, cheap fish for sure). On top of that we chose to pay $2 extra to have them \"spicy.\"   At this point, I thought they were actually going to give me spicy sushi, which a lot of places do. Instead they gave literally less than a dab of that same spicy mayo from the roll I had before on each of the maki. What a waste since I had that dish left full of spicy mayo! It did not make it taste better whatsoever.  We had to wait so long in between sets for them to give us the next dish, especially dessert....  Dessert - mango icecream - only thing decent here as they had tempura bits in it which was interesting  There are so many better sushi places not too far from here with much better prices and service.  Owners and workers are Chinese for your information."}
{"text":"This place has 3-4 star food. The servers are very good. I'm dinging them for the up charge for everything. $1 to change ramen for udon noodles?! $6 to add 3 tiny slices of fish cake to a bowl of $9 bowl of soup?! I didn't know the company was hurting for cash that badly.   And heaven forbid you ask to substitute something here; the manager tells you no and then berates you. (Past experience from 1 year ago).   Message is clear: they do not appreciate the clientele they have."}
{"text":"My first experience here was horrible but now I LOVE this place.  The manager invited me to come back on HIS tab, and I was glad. The food and staff have been excellent ever since.   The sushi is fresh and the service is pretty fast. I would def recommend it to any sushi lover looking for a cool sushi night."}
{"text":"I flew into Arizona, from California, for a date night with my girlfriend.  Saturday night we decided to go have dinner at Kabuki.  Neither of us had been there before, so we figured it would be nice to have something different and better than the usual restaurant or fast-food.  There was a minor issue, but overall, the food and price was amazing!  So, let's get over my one minor issue.  The place was super busy and, as expected, had a 30 to 45 minute wait.  The hostesses seemed a little disorganized but were  very friendly.  When she took my name, I asked if they could text me when a table was ready (This wasn't offered, I had to inquire).  The young lady took my cell phone number, and we took note of the time and went for a walk to pass the time.  About 30 minutes later, no word from the restaurant, we decided to talk back and check on our name.  Upon arriving, we were told they called our name and gave away our table.  We stated no one called us or texted us.  They did immediately find a table outside for us, however, which was nice.  But, someone should make sure that whole process works a little better.  Once outside, it was slightly annoying that it took a bit for someone to come to our table and take an order.  Once we got past this whole seating issue, the food and drinks came out.  Our waitress was awesomely friendly.  The food, presentation, and everything was simply delicious.  And, I must say the price was very nice on the pocket book.  My girlfriend and I will be visiting here again, maybe even for our next date night next time I fly in....."}
{"text":"One word best describes this place: overpriced.  I had the miso soup, the Seafood Yaki Soba, mint lemonade, and shrimp tempura, and our table split a Lotus on Fire roll.  The Lotus on Fire roll was great.  Spicy and tasty.  Can't complain there.  The mint lemonade was also a nice tasty surprise.  There really wasn't much else beyond that.  The Yaki Soba was bland, and the calamari was overcooked and rubbery.  The shrimp tempura was tasteless, and the sauce that came with it had no flavor. And the miso soup was weak.  One of my colleagues ordered a plate of pickled veggies (I forgot what the dish was called).  It was mostly a pile of boring dill pickles, and a small spattering of other, more interesting vegetables.  What a ripoff.  Our bill?  $25 apiece.  A little ridiculous considering the quality of food.  They seem to have a motif at Tempe Marketplace: it fits right in with its neighbors, Lucille's and Maria Maria, with its artsy-fartsy decor and disappointing, overpriced food."}
{"text":"Located in the southwest part of Town Square across H&M and a yogart shop you'll find Kabuki. They do have a pretty good Happy Hour Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm and Reverse Happy Hour Sundays 8PM to Closing, Monday-Thursday 9PM to Closing for a large menu of various food and drinks.  You have options for dining here. You can put in a reservation for a table which depending on the time and day could be at least an hour wait.  You can take a seat at they sushi bar which I believe is first come first serve. Or when you come in occupy the bar area on the right which is also first come first serve, it is more relaxing and great for lounging with large groups we come with at least 10-15 people and we stayed there for hours.  Service was pretty good for most of the night. Except for when they didn't bring me my food to me and later finding out they placed them on the table with the other half of the group where it got devoured.  They also were bad keeping track of who ordered what and billing the right person.    Kabuki is nicely decorated and food looked good. Loved the towers of beer as we ordered a bunch of them.  I did have a good time mostly because of the people I was with.  But I did  leave hungry please bring me my food I ordered nice time then I'll raise up the rating otherwise Kabuki is a between 3 and 4 star rating for me, more like 3.4."}
{"text":"Server was great , I love the crispy rice here they do it well , really well actually.  I had the miso cod was great , tasted the BBQ chicken was good,  miso soup a little salty but good , it's a safe dinner choice and Tivoli village is a great location any season"}
{"text":"Kabuki is a cool sushi spot in Tempe Marketplace.  We hadn't been in a while, and ended up in the area at dinner time tonight.  Ordered some Nigiri and some rolls.    The Hamachi was really great tonight.  The Sake and Maguro were also good.  The gals wanted a Dynamite roll, an Alaskan, and a couple of crunchy things, and the guys ordered the Fiery Lotus (or something like that) to get something spicy.  The rolls were tasty (but I'm still more of a Nigiri guy).  Service was great, and Edamame came to the table without us even asking.  That was a nice touch.  Good spot - if you're in the neighborhood of the Marketplace and have a hankering for sushi, or for general Japanese fare, give Kabuki a try!"}
{"text":"The GOOD: Decent interior design obviously aimed for ambiance at night. During the day, the light tends to take on a cafeteria feel. The facility and restrooms were clean, even though it was happy hour and there was a 20 minute wait to be seated.   The bar area is designed well and a nice place to sit and have a drink while waiting for a table to open. The televisions weren't too loud so it was easy to talk without the need to raise your voice. The sofas aren't that comfortable so it's clear that they really aren't meant for long, intimate conversations. Was an overall okay experience.   The staff is amazing. All were friendly and smiling despite the fact that it was happy hour and there was a waiting list. Everyone was presentable and appeared to be on point. Our server was confident, helpful and very pleasant.   The SO-SO: This establishment served our edamame cold and unsalted. While this is considered tradition for some, it is not my personal favorite. Nearly all of it went to waste.   The sushi roll variety.....well, there isn't much of one. It's mainly variations of the same  ingredients. Something fried, something raw, cream cheese, cucumber, avocado........there were a few other items offered as well, but that was pretty much it. They also offer what appeared to be a full hot menu which I didn't try simply because I was there specifically for sushi. This IS a Japanese restaurant so perhaps their popularity is from that side of the menu.   The BAD: The sushi sucked. Seriously. The oversized rolls were disproportionately stuffed with rice and had very little sushi. This actually ended up being a saving grace considering the sushi itself was NOT chilled, had a fishy odor and was slimy. HORRIBLE. The appetizer of deep fried calamari was served 10 mins AFTER the sushi arrived. It was NOT hot but was quasi warm. The unsweetened tea was light in color and was either watered down or not steeped long enough.   With all the positive reviews, it makes me wonder as to people's expectations. Is the bar set so low that this establishment is considered fine dining? Was this an off night for the chef? Is this experience true to the chain's standard or was this less than fantastic waste of time a direct reflection on the management of this particular location?   I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience when dining at Kabuki. This place is decorated pleasantly with all of the perfect dimmed lights on each and every tables. The service here is uppermost with great smiles, friendly conversations, warmhearted approaches of all of the waiters and waitresses.   The reason why I don't go here often because it's so far from where I live. However, this place is still my number one preference and still attracts me to come back once in a while for romantic date nights, or fun nights out with colleagues. And much more than that is the allurement of luscious appetizers, sushi, and smooth cocktail drinks.   The garlic edamame is a must try. The edamame is dexterously sautéed well with light touch of sea salt and fried garlic on top. I'm not impressed much with the Tebasaki Karaage because sweet soy sauce is not my taste, but the Tokyo Quesadilla definitely makes up for it with the crunchiness and tomato salsa.   I tried the Oyster Shooter before, but I just personally didn't like it. The smell was too strong for me, and it grossed me out a little trying to swallow the whole shot down my throat. I guess I'd better stick with the ones that I usually get. After finishing so many side plates, I only have room for some salads, and Sashimi Salad is always my first main course selection. The plate is nicely frilled with spring mixed salad and sashimi on top.  About the drinks, I can't give enough compliments to the lady who worked at the bar on the crowded Friday night. She recommended me the Peach Cocktail and a House Mojito and certainly I got hooked with it. Such a pleasant experience, but I have to take off 1 star because of the long wait time."}
{"text":"The view outside is awsome. My wife and I come here all the time and love it. All of the servers ( Sez and Alicen) are the best. The GM Huy has ALWAYS been there to handle any issue and chat with us. He is by far the best manager I have seen at Westgate. Best sushi in AZ!"}
{"text":"Updated 6/1/2018: Experienced additional services issues including having to ask for sweetener for our drinks, silverware when our food came out, wasabi and ginger when the sushi was brought out, observed servers bring food out not knowing which table to deliver it to often enough it became a joke with the couples around us.  Food was ok but not enough to bring me back until the services issues have been resolved. Previous Update Sticking with the 4-star rating again b/c service was a little off, stopped in before the Cubs game and it was not crowded, this time, we were at the bar.  Service was slow for a 3:30 slot which I would guess is prep time for dinner so I'll give a little slack.  I  had the Vegas Roll again which I really enjoyed, and one of my friends had the Alaskan roll and I grabbed one of them which I thought had a great smokey taste I would have taken more if he wasn't looking or ordered another roll if we had more time.  I'll keep coming back but a 5 rating will require a step up in service.  I appreciate the business owner responding to my prior comments which brought me back again and the server from last week which was not our server today recognized us and made the effort to come by and say hello."}
{"text":"What a great place!! The atmosphere, incredible menu, high end restaurant feel and the awesome food. All of this for the same prices as the other sushi places in town.  The service was also amazing. Our waitress was Jessica. So attentive and knowledgable with all the menu items we asked about. We never had an empty glass in front of us.  For an overall experience and atmosphere. Definitely a five star rating for me. Come try it out. We weren't disappointed and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Love the Vegas roll and love saki mmm"}
{"text":"Would not recommend coming here.  Over priced, not too fresh either.  Saki tasted like warm tequila."}
{"text":"The customer service was extraordinary on an evening during spring training. And, the food was delivered fresh which you expect from a sushi restaurant and they trumped it! My first review that I've done on Yelp and they deserve our accolades!"}
{"text":"I have been to Kabuki often and I've always had a good experience. They're a nice, clean restaurant and the sushi is delicious. They also have a late night happy hour that I love. I've brought my sister-in-law here before who's from Japan and is quite the sushi critic. She said its one of her top 3 places in the U.S.   They have good prices on their drinks and food. The sake sampler and sake sangria are yummy. When it comes to sushi, I would recommend the Lotus On Fire Role. For an app the Calamari is pretty delicious too. It's all around a good menu, the service is good and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"\"Kabuki\" is one of those restaurants where you walk in and expect to pay 70 dollars for a meal for two and end up paying 25 dollars instead.  I don't quite understand the whole pettiness on sushi, it's SUSHI. Raw fish, rice, vegtables and random sauces. If you don't like it, then you probably should try a different roll!   As a former sushi addict, I came to love this place that once fed my addiction. They have great prices on their menu items, so it's another excuse to be a pig and order twice as many rolls :) That is, if you are not on a date, you don't want your date to see your inner porker QUITE yet.. lol   This place is very modern. The view is AMAZING. It overlooks the Coyote Stadium, sure it's no New York City view, but it beats looking at the Glendale desert.  Kabuki makes my mouth water, I don't care what anyone says, just because this place is beautiful and upscale does not automatically mean their sushi will not be good!   Let me make this clear, Kabuki is delicious!! I use to go at least twice a week with my fellow sushi addict friends!! That says something, right?? :)   In conclusion, I heart Kabuki, I heart their sushi, I heart their ambiance and most of all I heart their prices."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to come here!  Food was amazing!  Service was amazing!  Hibachi show was best I've ever seen!!!"}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation for 4 at 6pm on Friday. They don't take reservations on Friday. That's fine. We got there at 540 and it was wide open. We asked to be seated outside. There were a lot of tables but we got 2 tables that were crooked and kept rocking. Couldn't pull two chairs out because they had the floor plates for umbrellas that weren't open behind the chairs.  Edamame came out quick. When our 2 guests arrived, we waited 15 more minutes for the server to come take their drink orders.  They brought the food out quick but all in wrong stages. First thing that came out was 1 persons sashimi dinner. Then 3 sushi rolls and then my mussels appetizer. My mussels in all seriousness had a paste inside and NO mussels. It's probably the mussels that were bad but the server said the manager told him the mussels sometimes fall out into the bowl. We looked and there were none.  Most of their rolls are California rolls as base and some toppings.  $120 dinner and at least we had good company cause everything else was a miss.  This isn't a sushi restaurant.  Good location on 2nd floor in westgate."}
{"text":"I've always loved the Kabuki in Tempe. I went here for the first time last night for a friend's birthday. The place is clean, nice and classy.   However, while me and my friends were eating edamame, half way through I FOUND A MAGGOT STICKING OUT OF MY EDAMAME. I showed it to one of the waitresses who just kind of smiled and didn't even apologize. The manager came out and explained how they use organic edamame and that sometimes things like this happen. He offered us a complementary dessert which we turned down since we brought a cake for our friend's bday. He then offered to give me (not everybody else) a discount which I said yes to. When we all got our orders, none of us could  eat. My spicy tuna roll tasted like it came from a local grocery store (I was sure it wasn't just the maggot incident).   The manager came back and gave me my sushi for free (My sushi was only $5.50.) He acted like he was doing me a favor. Our server didn't check on us or apologize for the maggot. She didn't really care for our table since she was going to get an automatic 18 % gratuity.  Spend your money someplace else PLS. Go to the Kabuki in Tempe instead. I am never going back to this maggot infested place."}
{"text":"Best place hands down to go in Tempe for sushi. It's got a great selection and now is accommodating those who can't eat sushi. It's a great atmosphere and it's close to the theatre if you're looking for a movie and dinner. I recommend the baja roll. Happy hour wines are cheap and delicious as well. Can't best a glass for 3.50$"}
{"text":"i was really in the mood for some fresh cold sushi to feel good and healthy. I left Kabuki feeling sad and blah.  The hostess sat me at sushi bar, which was totally fine as I was a single diner. When the server finally arrived, he stated I needed to give my sushi order to the sushi chef himself. My server also expressed disappointment in me for not ordering food off the menu. When my sushi arrived it was the completely wrong rolls. They were cooked with what looked like cheese or some sauce all over the top. My server was MIA. I figured I was tired and probably ordered the wrong ones by checking the wrong box on the sushi sheet.  When I finally got a hold of the man who was so ashamed of me, he handed me my bill. I had in fact ordered the rolls correctly. But received the wrong ones. By then, I had a couple of bites and was ready to get out of there. The rolls were also ungodly expensive.  Never again."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Happy Hour menu's  \"KiBomb\" has Sapporo beer and house saki combo priced crazy cool at $3.75. The crab salad, pot stickers, and Gold Rush rolls are amazing. It gets pretty crowded around 5 so try to come in 3-4'ish M-Th for Happy Hour.  They are usually understaffed but the waitstaff that they do have are super nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I go there fairly often and share the teriyaki chicken and shrimp tempura and vegetables. It comes with rice, a salad and soup and costs less than $ 20.00. The food and the service are both good."}
{"text":"Well designed Japanese restaurant with reasonable price and perfect location. They were located right next to H&M and Yogurtland in the town square. I walked pass it a lot but never really tried it. Due to my friend's recommendation, I decided to came here on my day off.  Design: The chairs and tables are made of woods, the light is semi dark semi light.  Service: The host was very friendly, he said hi to me the second I walked in and took me to my seat. My waiter was so nice and patient too, he answered all my questions and provided a kid menu for my friend's girl.   Appetizer:  Garlic edamame: they fried the garlic a little bit crispy and put the salt on top of the edamame, you are able to enjoy the crunchy flavor.  Seaweed Salad: seaweed salad pretty much taste the same anywhere, they put some veggie leafs underneath the seaweed salad.  Mixed tempura: I definitely love the tempura here, it doesn't give you those over fried disgusting oily taste. They lightly coated with the flour and deep fried it, so you can still taste the flavor of veggie and shrimp pretty well.  Sushi: Spider roll: very nice presentation, but not impressed by the taste. The roll has soft shell crabs and crab meat.  California roll: personally I'm not a big fan of California roll, because I think it's too plain and simple. However, the California roll here is different, the freshness of crab meat and the cream cheese match so well together.   Other: BBQ Beef ribs: the beef taste so tender, the sauce they use goes so well with the beef. I would order again if I come back."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night a week ago. Temps in the 50s and the outdoor seating was open. They had the door open to outdoor seating the entire time though. My boyfriend and I, along with other patrons were freezing! We grabbed our food and left."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi.  We ordered a signature platter to take to a dinner party as appetizer. All the sushi we tasted were delicious. The presentation was beautiful as well. We were very pleased. Only thing we should have done was to ask for soy sauce packets. Other than that I highly recommend their party platters."}
{"text":"Had some rolls! Very large portion!! Will come back:) I think they could use an afternoon mix plate:)"}
{"text":"Tonight we had Matt as our server and he was great! Super knowledgeable about the menu and was so kind to bring an extra rice to go for me. Hosts were super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Well, sushi paradise for vegetarians specially who have things for sushi and can't take smell of fish! This was amazing, met a few friends at the place, has some magpie sake shots and Sapporo beer  to start the night. Amazing sushi roll continues to come on the table with some small customization that very few sushi places would offer. Usually answers are \"they are already prerolled\" . They had vegan spicy mayo for my vegan friend as well. I love light food before drinking a lot so I can handle some booze and enjoy Vegas! This place is going to be my go to place now on! Sharing couple of great pictures I took while devouring 5 plates of sushi. These are spicy tofu with crispy rice and California  rolls."}
{"text":"The service was excellent; very attentive without being annoying. Selection of food was incredible with a fair price point, especially for Japanese food. We were impressed and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, I got one too many berry mojitos and a vegas roll. No time to wait for a table on a Sunday night! I'll come back again soon!"}
{"text":"After many visits, I am very impressed with everything about this place! The service in particular has been wonderful during every experience. The food has all been wonderful at a great price."}
{"text":"The sushi was OKAY. Not bad and not great. I was trying to see what the hype is all about and unfortunately I was left wondering if I had wasted my money. Our server wasn't really attentive and personable. It seemed like she was rushing us out for her tip. The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars was the complementary edamame. Who does that?! The fact that they gave complementary edamame really saved this place from getting 1 star. Anyways overall I don't think I would come back here based on the bad service and the \"basic\" sushi everyone is hyping up."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here to eat once in awhile with my friends. I dislike a couple female employee's there. They gossip way too much and the service comes from there is just horrible. I love the food, even though it does take awhile for it to come out . LY - ( male server) is awesome!"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday with my daughter for July 4th. It was a very enjoyable experience for the both of us. Our server Gerilyn, even though very busy, kept our drinks filled and our orders were perfect. The manager on staff Lihn was very nice and visited our table to make sure everything was ok. Jo the bartender was great with our drinks."}
{"text":"Beautiful place in Westgate mall. We had sushi roll with octopus, Mozarella tempura and beef kabob. Octopus is too chewy for me. I would not have ordered that roll if I knew it had octopus. Mozzarella  tempura was very good as was the beef kabob. The table was sticky and the soy sauce dispenser leaked. But good sushi in a gorgeous setting"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Kabuki.  You know its a good place to eat if the restaurant is packed at 8p on a Thursday night.   I used the check in offer for the free California Rolls, ended up loving this roll so much that I ordered another one.  They do cut their sushi into larger pieces, so its 6 instead of 8 pieces like everywhere else.  Waiter dropped off free Edamame in which we gobbled down.  The only thing we did not like and it wasn't because the flavor, was the Sesame Chicken appetizer.  The chicken used in this particular dish was stringy, chewy and probably dark meat.  The flavor was still good, but the quality of the chicken was bad.  I will have to check out the location in Tempe, AZ."}
{"text":"My wife loves good tempura so we went to try this place.  As most other reviewers have said, this place is just so-so.  The prices are higher than most other Japanese restaurants by about 15-20% due to its location and ambiance.  The tempura was mediocre at best.  I had the luncheon tonkatsu which was good, but not outstanding.  At least it wasn't too thin or overcooked.  I also noticed that they had toro on the menu so I ordered a sashimi side order for $24.  I must admit, the toro was good and they gave me a pretty presentation with an ample serving for the price.  Toro is always very expensive so I was not surprised or disappointed.  We also ordered a couple of side orders of ala carte nigiri sushi just to try -- again, OK, but not outstanding.  I also ordered a large Asahi beer @ $7.50 each; a little high by Phoenix standards.  In summary, the food was OK, but nothing that would support my going back and paying the higher prices.  The service staff is friendly, but not well versed in Japanese food fare and this makes for unknowledgeable people who cannot answer questions about the food and its preparation.  I guess they are trying to cater to the Americans and not placing much emphasis on the authenticity of the food they are serving.  Our lunch bill for two came to $70, which is high for lunch by any standard.  But the manager never came over to ask how we liked our meal or what we thought, or anything like that.  Don't get me wrong -- I don't expect special treatment, but my experience is that if you have a patron that spends a lot of money at your restaurant, you should always go say something to make them feel comfortable and increase the chances that they will come back."}
{"text":"I definitely had better.  This place is over rated.  Second time I have been here and had the same poor experience.  I felt I was paying more for the location than I was for the food.  The food was okay and the service was poor.  If you ever decide to go eat around west gate I recommend you try the Yard House, they have a great selection of beer and some great lunch and dinner items."}
{"text":"Everything is wonderful from the sushi to the noodles.. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Today our server was Taylor. Super attentive and never let my cup of water run dry. This place has the best spicy tuna. Today, the texture of the rice was a bit off. More on the hard side than the fluffy side. However, it made up for Taylor's top notch serving skills."}
{"text":"Nice spot in a cool outdoor mall.  Food is on point . Typical Japanese rest....They do not have exotic sushi as some of the higher end sushi spots in Vegas or NYC do....  .  Service was excellent .   Great energy in this place   It's loud so it's great if you have little kids   5 stars for me...."}
{"text":"My husband and I will NOT eat sushi anywhere else (sorry) because not only is this facility clean and the staff id friendly, but you know that the sea food is fresh and made of great quality. I just love to enjoy a drink or dinner here with my family. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"WOW! This was my first time eating here. The staff was very warm and professional. The FOOD!! VERY good and fresh.  Let me tell you about AARON!  This guy made me feel like a movie star. I never had to wonder where he was!  He went over and above the minimum standard unusually expect. If I had a business he would be the example of what I want.  Enjoy your TIP!!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with my kids and the sign said closes at 10:00pm sundays and we got there at 9:35 and the doors were looked my 3 yr left crying he wanted his chicken.. Bad management!"}
{"text":"While we always enjoy the Tempe location, I was disappointed with this one.  We came after the Cardinals game so it was busy.  Likely why food came out very spaced out.  My two rolls came out much later than everyone else's food.  My spicy scallop roll was one of the worst I've had.  Rice was stale and roll crumbled with first bite.  The scallops were okay but the spicy sauce was just squirted on top instead of mixed in.  The yellowtail had similar hard rice and fish did not taste very fresh.  I tried a piece of my husband's albacore crunch roll and it was decent and better than my rolls.  I don't usually order these rolls at Kabuki so not sure if it's just these particular rolls or if it's the location.  At the Tempe location I love their Sunkissed roll and tuna firecracker."}
{"text":"I had never been to or heard of this place but I love sushi. My brother had recommended we try it out for a family get together dinner and I will say wow I was really impressed with the food it was great! The watering staff we all very welcoming and quick to help with anything we needed! I  know with sushi to expect a large bill but surprisingly the bill wasn't bad for a party of 7! I will definitely be coming back and recommending it to anyone in the Tempe area!!p.s. It's a much better experience the RA"}
{"text":"I've been going here for my Japanese fix for two years now and I haven't been disappointed once. I love being a Red Mask Club member that does reward well throughout the year. I am very fond of the lunch/dinner combinations, especially the teriyaki chicken or beef ribs (which are so incredibly tender). The price is right and the service is always fast and friendly. Sushi and cocktails are also fabulous. This is a place where I can enjoy the food and ambience with a large group or by myself. One of my favorites in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My buddy and I happened to go to Kabuki at the Westgate center on a Cardinals home game day.  Kabuki has a One Dollar Game Day Menu.  It goes something like this.  Buy a beer at regular price, get the next one for a dollar.  This special was good for appetizers, sushi, an rolls.  We made it out of Kabuki for under fifty bucks before tip.  It was a great deal.  The sushi was just okay.  Three stars for a good bargain.  I have to mark my calendar for those home games.  It is a good reason to grub on the west side."}
{"text":"The service has been great. Brandon our server was always available. Never had to wait other than our food once we ordered. Food was fresh. Ordered steak and chicken hibachi. Brandon made sure we had no peanut allergies at the table. It's nice to know that some servers actually ask and disclaim the use of peanuts."}
{"text":"Great service!  The Saki sangria was a bit \"flowery\" tasting.  Lotus roll was exceptional!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and this is based off of my second visit.  Okay I know Vegas is known for their AYCE sushi hot spots, but when you come here be prepared to spend $$$ cause they don't offer that. With that being said their sushi is really good and really fresh. As far as sushi goes,  I ordered their spicy tuna and cucumber rolls. The spicy tuna was on point, not too much mayo, not too much spice,  and not too much rice. The cucumber roll was just how I like it. My friend ordered their King Crab roll and she raved about it so I'll try that next time! Despite the prices,  I didn't feel like I wasted money on the sushi since it's good quality. What I do feel like I wasted my money on was their chasu ramen. I know I know,  I have no idea what I was thinking either..... In my defense I was suffering from allergies and thought soup would help. Honestly,  I've bought 0.35 cent ramen from Walmart that tasted better than what I had, and this was almost $9!!!! The broth was so watery and had no richness to it like what you would expect from real ramen. It's possible that the  soup base came from a packet that anyone could have easily found at an Asian supermarket for like $2. The noodles were also overcooked and mushy.  So please use this as a warning and skip the ramen! Go to Monta, Ramen Sora, or Fukumimi if you've got a taste for some delicious rameny goodness.  I will say that as a sushi place they've got great quality, and I look forward to coming back and exploring more of that section of the menu,  but no more ramen for me!"}
{"text":"I worked in the area and finally stop by in the afternoon. I have now made it my mission to stop by at least twice a week. I always sit at the bar and have never had to wait for someone to say hi or wait for long to have my order taken.  I have had the California roll, chicken teriyaki,  tempura vegetables and a few small items. I have had the sake usually warm but always good. The manager stops by and says hi as do others.  Price wise this place is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just spoiled, by living in California and having spent lots of time in Japan over the years. When my brother who lives nearby suggested Kabuki I said \"why not?\" and off we went. Well superficially it's great, nice decor, smells right, big menu with lots of choices of small plates and big plates.  It was perfectly mediocre. I ordered some gyoza and a bowl of ramen, really what i'd consider simple fare, and was underwhelmed. The gyoza were a notch above Trader Joe's, and the Ramen broth really lacked much flavor at all, until i liberally adulterated with peppers.  My brother and his wife adore this place, for the few items they order again and again - not very adventurous (they were not familiar with either gyoza or ramen - go figure).  I loved the location, the staff was pleasant and accommodating, but my palate was not really impressed. Would I come back? Absolutely. Hopefully my choices will be more in their wheelhouse next time."}
{"text":"We just stumbled upon this sushi bar, and we were pleasantly suprised that the sushi was really good and fresh, the portions were HUGE!  That was shocking, we couldnt even finish half lol  The Westgate crowd was fun to watch, lots of loud saki bomber silliness going on , typical of a sushi house so whatever.  The bathroom is rather odd, gave me a moment of vertigo lol You have to go to know what I mean lol  I have to say I dont like it when the server says they are new so they dont know crap lol and bring everything out at once on HUGE trays when we are still enjoying the appetizer, but whatever.  All in all it was tasty and filling I guess I am not a complainer, I have been to pretty much every sushi place in Phoenix and Scotts, this is not the worst, and the prices were really low, If I am out that way again sure why not."}
{"text":"Came here for my fathers birthday , on a Sunday night there was a 30 min wait for a table , I did not mind at all , service was great , between five of us we shared the Osusume , which was a platter of rolls , presentation -beautiful , yet when it came to eating , the rolls were quick to fall apart , I eat sushi quite frequently at other sushi restaurants, but other than that everything else was great , they sang happy birthday to my old man & the night was over . Now here I am , woken up very rudely at 3 am with painful stomach pains , cramps almost like giving birth , and you all know what happens after eating bad food , I don't want to go into detail but it's not pretty ."}
{"text":"Wow what a great experience we had at Kabuki last night! Joe was our server and he was wonderful. He gave great recommendations to us first-timers and even had fun with our littlest guy!   Oldest son had dragon roll and the eel was so fresh tasting with just the right amount of sauce. A very generous portion with 8 slices so it had enough for a meal or enough to share if you wanted!  Husband had the  beef teriyaki which was a very generous portion served with soup, salad, and rice. I had the chicken sukiyaki which was HUGE. I didn't necessarily care for the texture of the cellophane noodles but the rest of the soup was delicious. My littlest boy had the roku which was basically beef teriyaki over ramen noodles with a salad. It was really very good.  I also had the calpico soda which I'd not had before. It was made with milk, soda water, and peach kiwi juice. It was terrific!   Our experience at Kabuki would not have been better and I can't wait to go again very soon!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting Kabuki, I went there for dinner and I think its my last time at this place.  Went by myself and sat at the bar to watch a baseball game.  First, the bartender took at least 8-10 minutes to acknowledge me.  (He was busy chatting it up with two ladies seating at the bar.) Second, I asked him,... I do not like any mayo and anything with cream, but I would like a sushi roll that has spicy tuna.  He could not recommend any sushi roll with my requirements.  Anyway, I ended up getting a chicken teriyaki bento box.  Nothing special.  3 stars"}
{"text":"I got their chicken teriyaki plate with brown rice and it also came with miso soup and salad! Not bad for $8.95. Environment is real cozy and staff was nice! Also if you order any of their rolls they come with salted edamame!"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times with my family. Today tops them all! Travis was very proper and took care of us very well. I love to take my children with me to difference restaurants and rarely do we get the high level of service has given us. Especially with my crazy kiddos. He was very informative about the menu. It's good to see someone that really knows what they are serving. Thank you for taking care of me and my family especially on sons special day! We would give you 10 if we could!"}
{"text":"Our server was nice but the food here is not very good. I've been to all you can eat sushi places that had better quality food. Stay away from their lotus roll. They have a prime location and I believe it is the only reason why they have customers because its in the busiest part of Town Square."}
{"text":"Kabuki is great. When I am traveling between Vegas and Cali, I love to stop at a Kabuki's for sushi. I get the same quality of service not matter which location I go to. I am a big fan"}
{"text":"It's a decent one for me and it was my first time here. Sushi was pretty good. You have many other options not just sushi. We got the Vegas roll, the lasagna and the tako. I really didn't like the tako that much but the other 2 rolls are really good. I loved the peach iced tea. Definitely should try out that one.  The price is pretty decent not too expensive even tho it's located inside town square. The service was on point when my server constantly would check up on me. Seeing if I'm ok or not! The place is pretty fancy, comes with a cute little lighted candles, would be romantic for a date.  The only negative thing would be, the hot stone grill bbq thing. It was $24.95 for one order( keep in mind you gotta wait for 20-30 mins for the hot stone thing to be ready) and we thought it would be a big order but turn out it only like 10 pieces of meat in there. Has no flavor either. Which was a disappointment for me. If you love grill BBQ, might as well go to ayce kbbq instead of ordering this. Bc w/ 24.95 you could afford a whole new ayce. Other than that, everything is good so far. Will be back."}
{"text":"We went to Kabuki for a party- it's definitely a good restaurant for groups. From the moment we walked in the door, the service was friendly & above average. Our waitress marched to the beat of her own drum but she made us lol several times & was more than capable of accommodating all of our requests, etc. The funniest part was that she asked if there was a b'day, because there were gifts- we told her it was a going away party for one of our friends & asked if there was anything special they could do. We died when, after dinner, they brought out vanilla ice cream with \"happy b'day (& a heart)\" written in chocolate syrup & about 6 of them sang in Japanese (with some sort of jingly accoutrements). To the food!... We ordered the standard edamame & also the garlic one. Both were very good in their own rights. The garlic one smells very very garlicky when it 1st comes out so we were somewhat apprehensive but it was delish. We all enjoyed the miso soup (even those who aren't \"soup people\"). We ordered a plate of the sesame chicken for the table to share- it was ok, it would have been better if it was white meat. I'm a salt kinda girl but it was walking a thin line of being too salty. The sesame ginger dipping sauce didn't help so we got a side of their self-proclaimed famous teriyaki sauce (dying for a sweeter balance!). Surprisingly, it wasn't that sweet- when it was all said & done, I opted to dip in soy sauce. It just seemed like alot of work for an appetizery dish! We ordered several sushi rolls- all of which were well received by our taste buds & tummies. There was also an order of the chicken teriyaki & an order of the beef one (to please the meat-&-potatoes guys). They were not skimpy on the meat &, at one point, I made the oxymoron declaration that I'd \"never heard them so quiet!\", as they munched away. In addition to the happy b'day ice cream, we ordered one of their chocolate squares to divvy up (it's scored so it was easy to share). It was unusual, it was scrumptious. In fact, I'd go back just for the dessert menu- there are a few other items I'd like to try! Was I blown away? No. But, based on location, ambiance, service & the overall pleasant experience, I'd be happy to go there again."}
{"text":"Amazing great sushi. Awesome happy hour. Lots of complimentary items. Great service. When servers are weeded the management seems to be there pulling up the slack. Just a wonderful experience. Thank you kabuki"}
{"text":"Yummy! i love sushi and i love this place. we went last night about 7:30pm and were quickly seated in front by the window. our server promptly arrived for our drink order. We ordered a bottle of the plum wine for $20 and it was delicious. we also ordered the seafood salad, which was a generous heaping of crab, tons of baby scallops and shrimp over a bed of mixed greens with a ginger dressing, cucumber and carrots. we also ordered yellow tail & maguro sushi, plus the eel, crab and avacodo roll & the fried california roll served on eel sauce. it was all very fresh and tasty. the last roll melted in my mouth, their california rolls have a crab mix inside, my only complaint, except when its deep fried.  the free serving of edamame was a nice start too!   the first time we tried kabuki was on my sisters birthday last July. she had a group of 15 and they were very accomodating, even dressed and presented our own cake brought in for her. for a big group, they did a phenominal job, even with all the split checks \"Oye vei\" just the thought. oh yeah speaking of head effecting, we all had a popper that makes a bang when you pull the string and at the blow of the candles we pulled the strings. even with all the loud pops and the stares, the servers, managers and bussers were so nice, not saying a word or frowning on it.  (but don't try this unless your ready for the repercussions) ENJOY yelpers and make sure if you don't want a big 'o roll to eat, order the cut rolls, hand rolls are always big (someone should teach a sushi 101 class to teach these things, it might curtail all the bad reviews)  the best part about eating there is the nice walk around the tempe market place. its a strip mall-turned outdoor entertainment haven for tourist, but its people watching at its best. only problem is its in an akward area, with one way in and one way out. the traffic in & out sucks and sometimes the parking is worse, but get over it , enjoy the company your with and get your Kabuki on!"}
{"text":"The service is slow, wrong order served, asking for raspberry tea and getting plain tea.  I don't know if it was just the restaurant or the waitress but never again"}
{"text":"Get the sushi & sashimi.  Forget the rest.  Solid offering on all fronts, with a killer yellowtail that was just buttery and perfect.  Very interesting and tasty twist on the spicy scallop handroll (my favorite), nice little sesame vibe, no mayo, and a perfect level of spice (tingle on the lips without full on tears).  Salmon skin roll and albacore were both good, and the unagi was surprisingly awesome (right off the broiler too, none of that cold mushy stuff they give you sometimes).  Spicy tuna wasn't spicy enough but still good fish.  Sushi chefs were great - the yellowtail was the chef's personal favorite and while ordinarily not something I eat, this stuff was YUM.  Finished off with the tempura red bean ice cream - good but I think I like red bean mochi better.  But still a nice ending.  Lemon drop cocktail was good as well. Only surprise?  No sunomono on the menu, boooo.  But if I am ever in Vegas again (which I doubt as I am not a fan, just here on business), I'll definitely be back.  PS - Northwesterners, be prepared for exorbitant prices.  Like SoCal, sushi is massively overpriced so don't be surprised if dinner for two is $100+."}
{"text":"My usual spot I hit up before and after games for drinks and food if I didn't fill up on overpriced nachos and junk at the stadium. I frequent the bar the most and they're on point with the drinks whether it's drowning in my sorrow whiskey and cokes or if I get fancy with some mules they've never steered me wrong. The food is amazing too since the other reason I frequent this place is for my west side friends birthday dinners I feel like that is a statement in itself that this place is good and consistent. I definitely dig their shishito peppers and their sushi is good but oddly when I was trying my friends ramen and not to sound snobby, I really liked the flavor even though this is a chain place and I've been to ramen joints in California. The parking lots around the place although chaotic looking aren't that bad and I've never had problems parking and getting in and the big sign makes it near impossible to miss unless you've already had one too many before strolling in. The staff is also super friendly from bar to servers I've never had an issue and always feel like they go above and beyond to help even though I'm running from table to bar to order birthday drinks in secret and being obnoxious."}
{"text":"Love their Yelp check in offer free California roll!  Alaskan roll is super yummy and lunch specials are filling and priced just right!"}
{"text":"I have been going to kabuki for the last 2 years. Food is always excellent best sushi I have ever tried. However service is spotty at best, just today I ordered a large order and the lady told me they would call me when it was ready. One hour later I get a call with a lady saying there just calling to let me know my food has been ready for a long time. No apology no offer to make it better just your foods ready for a while. I had no intention to buy cold food that has been sitting for a while. I think it would be better to say your food will be ready in about 20 minutes then I would have gone to check instead of waiting for a call that never came."}
{"text":"Based on the poor customer service from the server, I will not be back. The food was just OK. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"All the servers I've had were very friendly. The service was quick and made sure I don't need anything else. BUT the hostesses are a different story. Every single time I've been there, majority of them were just plain rude! Other than that though, I can't complain. love the food. The Lotus on Fire Roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 3 stars. Not my favorite place ever, but living in Seattle sets my standards high. The salmon was fatty, and the rolls were"}
{"text":"Service is the answer!   Very good sushi... that's what your going to find here. I had the Lobster roll and the Spicy Tuna both were great. Saki bombs were on point and great drink specials.  The separation in a tourist trap area is...customer service!  The bartender was excellent on 4/24, explain some of the Japanese beers on tap and was very attentive. I enjoyed his conversation and appreciate his work ethic. I will return when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Great Sushi Place....my favorite in Summerlin Area!   Good service and consistantly great food!   Reccomend this to all who love Sushi!"}
{"text":"I heard this restaurant was great and the proximity to our hotel made it an easy choice.  The only aspect of this restaurant that warrants 5 stars was our perfectly ADORABLE server.  She was incredibly helpful and just so damned cute! Other than that, the food was not very good.  I wish I would have read the review about the maggot before I ate there.... now I'm wondering! Eeew.  We ordered a variety of entrees and appetizers as one of us was a carnivore who hates anything from the sea, one a carnivore who loves seafood and one a vegan.  So unimpressed with everything.  As a fellow yelper mentioned, tracking down silverware was a bit of a feat.    But did I mention our server?  Oh so cute.  If I remembered her name, I would totally give her props."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here.  It's bad Japanese food.  I had the chirashi.  The sashimi was a third of what I see at most Japanese restaurants on the west coast.  If you want people to come back, you need good value.  Also, you need to tell your sushi chefs how to cut sashimi properly.  You cut it it the wrong way, it's tough.  It looks like the sashimi was cut with a plastic knife.  Lastly, teach your staff to pronounce the Japanese dishes correctly.  I'm Japanese and I hate when people pronounce things wrong.  It's \"oo-dohn\", not \"oo-dawn\". The server tried to correct me.  Excuse me?"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place in the last few months but it has certainly fallen off. The food has always been delicious but the service and cleanliness has taken a dive.    Management is not accommodating at all. In fact, the manager is downright rude and condescending. The hostesses trip over each other, don't acknowledge customers when you walk in and act as if they are annoyed to be working there.   The women's restroom looked like it hadn't been serviced in hours. Toilet paper on the floor, wet tiles and it reeked of urine!   After two bad experiences this month alone it's doubtful we'll be going back any time soon. What a shame.... This place used to be one of our favorites. :("}

{"text":"Was very happy that the lunch specials even applied on weekends and holidays!   Tried: BEEF SUKIYAKI- so flavorful.  Loved it.  Was a little bizarre to my 12 year old daughter.  I would order again! SOY RAMEN - Delicious.  Better flavor and ingredient choices than our stand by Republic Ramen + Noodle in Tempe. CALIFORNIA ROLL - daughter loved them GYOZA DUMPLING - okay.  nothing special TOKYO STEAMED BUN/PORK BELLY - I didn't like it that much but the daughter did. I would really like to eat here again.  Wish it was closer to home."}
{"text":"Pretty little place tucked into a mall just off the strip. We were hungering for something that wasn't a buffet, so this place was a nice find. We started with some hot sake, which was littler than the \"Large\" size would lead you to think. Sushi was tastier than the sukiyaki or ramen that we got. Well-seasoned sushi rice, and the fish was decently fresh. For sushi, we got the eel and avocado roll, the omakase deluxe sushi set, and then a shrimp tempura roll. Shrimp tempura roll was a little meh, but the other stuff was oishiiiii."}
{"text":"Very nice and their happy hour is pretty good. Had our holiday party here. I would definitely bring back a large group"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday and ate at the sushi bar. It was slow at the restaurant. Service was ok the sushi chefs were not really talkative or in to their customers. I ordered the lunch sushi special and it came with 6 spicy tuna rolls and four or five mixed sushi and rice. I felt the special had added value since it came with a salad. The sushi was fresh the spicy tuna was ok it did not have much flavor. I would definitely come back here for lunch or try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants. Inside is very nice and has a good color scheme for their interior. I got to say I went to the bathroom I was really surprised because the bathroom walls was slanted so it tripped me out. I think because of the way the building is that's why it's like that. I felt kind of dizzy a little bit to when I went to the bathroom because the room had these slanted walls at the sink too. The service was good the waiter we had was very nice. I went with a group of five on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too bad. We had to wait 10 to 15 minutes before getting seated. They have a wide selection of sushi specialty rolls. I got the rose role and rainbow roll. I was really hungry so one sushi roll wasn't enough for me. But kind of hurt me inside a little bit because the prices there are on a little bit on the expensive side. I understand it's sushi but I feel like they can lower their price a little bit and it's more of a casual restaurant in a fancy restaurant. The rose roll was $11.95 and the rainbow roll was $13.95. The quality of the sushi is really good though and the atmosphere is very nice. If I'm in the area this this is my go to place for sushi but otherwise I can go somewhere else for a cheaper price with the same quality."}
{"text":"Sunday night date night !!!!....In the perfect location ....did a little bit of shopping and walking around prior to eating. We did a walk into this Japanese place there are 3 options sit at the bar (which is suppose to be the fastest service ) option 2 wait for seating or option 3 sit at the sushi  bar ...we choose bar . The waiter came out as soon as we sat down took our drink order and made a couple good drink suggestions I went for the SAKIRITA (wine and fruit lots of it ) delish !!!! Ordered LOBSTER ROLL, SPIDER ROLL , LAVA ROLL (spicy tuna and fried jalapeno)  .  Very good and fast service !!!!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for happy hour on a Wednesday and it was slow when we first arrived at 5 but got busy for dinner. They have discounted prices during happy hour and we enjoyed the free edamame, Brussels sprouts with garlic chips, sesame chicken, and gyoza. My friend has the spicy tuna salad and I had the nigiri salmon. We enjoyed the authentic green tea that was bottomless. Lots of parking in the garage. The restaurant is very clean. They didn't rush us out even though we sat that chatting for awhile. Definitely get the Brussel sprouts and chicken...to die for!!! Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"I eat here quit often, I notice a lot of changes to their menu. I like it!   I like a great restaurant that does great changes to their menu. It gives me something new to look forward to coming back to. The place is always busy, however the service is quick. I like taking big crowd's here for birthdays etc. Enjoy! Oh and try and Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch....   The first time I ate here I tried the seaweed salad... Delicious.. so I wanted to order it again...  I had asked one of the wait staff if I could have the salmon lunch special but change out the regular salad for seaweed, he said ok...  After being served the seaweed, and began eating it.. I was told I would have to pay full price that they could not subsitute it. $6   (tasted just as good as I remembered)  With that being said, I now had to change my lunch, so I tried the Sunkissed roll..  Good choice,  and they used brown rice and put the sauce on the side.   Along with an iced tea, it was a great meal... However with tax and tip it came out to $23, not what you would expect for 1 roll, cup size of salad and drink."}
{"text":"Love it here always fresh and cold sushi   Staff friendly and helpful priced right  I brought out of town guest here from Oregon as they were bragging about how Portland has the best sushi and how can Arizona have fresh cold and professionally made sushi lol I said trust me!! They were so amazed at how good the sushi was and very affordable drinks were great so I can only say 5stars is my option"}
{"text":"Large rolls and a great happy hour. Awesome patio for a date night or girls night out. I love how their happy hour has specialty rolls. The rose roll is my favorite. Large menu with lots of other options if you don't love sushi."}

{"text":"I have to admit I don't understand the appeal of this huge shopping and dining complex unless you need some place to eat before a game at the stadium or the arena that lie adjacent to it. Yeah, that's not why I was there. I was staying at the Renaissance for a week-long business trip and didn't have a car, so dining options for me and my colleagues were limited to this complex. We had already tried the Yard House, so we thought we'd take a chance with this modern-looking Japanese restaurant. It's a large space that doesn't really look like any Japanese restaurant that I've been to.  The menu went on for quite a while with a heavy focus on rolls. I thought we could share a $12.95 Rainbow Roll which looked like it was slapped together in the dark (photo: http://bit.ly/2d7BvwV). Rainbow rolls are a good litmus test to see if the fish is fresh, and it passed that test if just barely. Somewhat better was the $13.95 Hamaichi Sake Box, which honestly looked like it was made with a sushi kit. It had layers of salmon and crab between the rice and it was topped off by pieces of yellowtail (photo: http://bit.ly/2cvIPBB). Again what I was missing was the creative aplomb a true sushi chef would have applied.  Filling up on the rolls, I just ordered the $6.95 Mixed Tempura appetizer as my entree (photo:  http://bit.ly/2cGOwzC), and this was marginally the best part of my meal probably because my expectations weren't that high at this juncture even if the strange dark brown tone was off-putting. There was actually plenty of shrimp alternating withe the vegetables on my plate. In standard order, it came with a sloppy green salad and a bowl of miso soup first, but the highlight was the small $15.95 bottle of the Hakutsuru Superior Sake served on ice (photo: http://bit.ly/2cUl36O). It offered a nice melon fragrance that was unexpected but refreshing on a typically humid Phoenix evening. Regardless, a return visit doesn't seem likely.  FOOD - 2 stars...weak on most fronts with the sake the only real salvation AMBIANCE - 2 stars...suburban contemporary setting doesn't feel very evocative of anything close to Japan SERVICE - 2 stars...inconsistent at best TOTAL - 2 stars...faux-Japanese"}
{"text":"All in all, this is one of my fave spots to go for sushi here in the valley, mostly because of the japanese soda's, Most other places don't have them which sux!    service here is always great, fast seating times even with larger groups.  Sushi is good as well.  No complaints"}
{"text":"I've been to Kabuki a few times and have never been that impressed. The service is mediocre, the food is decent at best and the cocktails are nothing special. The ingredients seem semi fresh, but there are definitely way better places in the valley if you are looking for delicious sushi. My suggestions: Ra, Blue Wasabi or Squid Ink (depending on which part of the valley you are in).  If for some reason my review hasn't changed your mind from going and you find yourself at Kabuki DO NOT order the Sangria, you WILL BE disappointed. As for the food -- I guess there are worse places you could go."}

{"text":"When i first went to Kabuki in 2009, they made the most delicious, tasty, flavorful cha-siu ramen i've probably ever had in my life... I am a huge ramen-lover and try it whenever I can wherever I can so I consider myself fairly well-versed in the ramen-tasting world. However, it's been a long while since they've watered down the recipe (literally).  I've asked for them to thicken the broth several times and wind up with half-the amount of soup that would normally be served or the same watered down version.  I've gone back several times in hope that these were just flukes but no....  This was just sad and disappointing.  For what would have been a really nice restaurant this just left me feeling cheated.    The rest of the menu is pretty decent for a somewhat americanized sushi restaurant.  I must admit, their happy hour has very good prices for their sushi.  Their alcoholic beverages are not bad either,  the shochu that i've tried is quite good!  If you've ever had shochu in Japan, you know how incredibly amazing the drinks are and although this is definitely not at the same level, it is the closest I've found in the states."}

{"text":"I would normally give this restaurant four to five stars but after my experience on Monday for lunch I have to drop my rating to two stars. I dine here every time I'm in Vegas and have always been more than satisfied. This time around was just the opposite. I went during lunch with my parents and my sister and ordered off the lunch menu. The server must have been new because the service was substandard. My sister and I ordered the tonkatsu and said lunch portion. The server asked, \"with tempura\" I said no just tonkatsu. He asked the same thing to my sister. I understand upselling, but if I want tempura I would ask for it. My parents ordered the salmon and tempura lunch combo and said they would be sharing it. The real issue occured when the bill arrived and we were all charged dinner prices. Mind you this was one in the afternoon. When I brought this to the servers attention he said \"oh, you wanted lunch?\" He said he didn't know that and would take care of it. He returned with the bill but to my surprise only one of the meals had been adjusted to the lunch price. I again said we all ordered lunch he said he didn't know that and would have to talk to the manager. Why I ask would one person order lunch and the other two dinner when we are there during lunch.  When the bill finally returned they still had the dinner charges on the bill and just took out one tonkatsu. The server said don't worry it comes out to the same as three lunches. I asked why couldn't they just charge us for the lunches so I could see it itemized and not just assume it was correct. At this point I was fustrated and went up to speak with the manager, (and I use this term \"manager\" loosely)Tom Suciawan. It finally dawned on me why this simple customer service issue turned into a hot mess. Tom wouldn't know customer service if it bit him in the a--. When I went up to him he proceeded to give me attitude and said rudely\"it's all been taken care of and you got dinner portions for the price of lunch\". He said he already spoke to the server and would speak to him again. I replied that I simply wanted to bring this to attention, but was frankly surprised with his lack of customer service himself. I can see where his staff could lack in this area as Tom would be the last person who should be training them. With so many places to eat in Vegas, what brings me back is great service. My warning to lunch diners, be sure you emphasize you are odering lunch not dinner and be sure you check your bill!"}
{"text":"Great menu with a lot of options. They have a great selection of rolls and their entree's are fabulous as well. Super friendly and quaint environment."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to eat here last night. It was busy as usual, but we only had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table. Our food was delicious ( I got a couple rolls and my husband got the teriyaki chicken ) and the service was one star away from being amazing. The food came out very quickly and for how busy they were I was impressed. They must work like a well oiled machine! I ordered a sake bomb and never ran out of what I needed, beer or sake, however my husband had to ask a few times for his soda to be refilled. Which he drinks a lot of soda and fast so refills are needed quite frequently. Our waiter brought my stuff and forgot his soda, so while my husband was distracted by the dessert menu I pointed to his soda when the waiter asked if there was anything else I needed beside the sake he brought me. He nodded and said oh yea. Which is fine. But then he took two other tables orders and my husband just watched him waiting for his soda. So about 5 minutes later he got his soda. So over all food and service was great. Just gotta hit those steps of service. It was my birthday and everything went perfect for me so I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"Food was not so bad, waiter not so good! No personality whatsoever! I wanted to show him a thing or two about a thing or two... I guess it's just a job to him and it shows! Pretty sad actually. I ordered the seafood salad and wasn't that bad, had great taste! I guess I will go there again when I'm craving a Kirin Ichiban again."}
{"text":"Kabuki is a fairly decent sushi spot located in the west part of Town Square across from the H & M.   As far as taste and value are concerned, you can get your sushi craving satisfied without breaking the bank.  Most of the standard rolls such as spicy tuna, California, yellowtail, Philly roll, etc. are around $5.  The rolls were not bad for the price and they did not skimp on the filling inside the rice.  However, their B.S.C.R. (baked scallop California roll) sounded better than it actually tasted.  Like what some other Yelpers whose culinary opinions I respect have said, the service is what brings this place down a notch.  Having to ask two or three times for an extra fork and spoon should never be a diner's problem.   Finding our server was often times a real life \"where's Waldo\" challenge.    Following dinner, a request for the check and a to-go box was handled at a snail's pace.  We received the check, but could not find our server, or any other for that matter, to pick up my credit card.   After finally being able to pay, a second reminder to our server was the 'hint-hint' she needed to hand us a to-go box.   We packed our extra food (non-sushi items) and headed out quickly.  In a town full of sushi spots, go elsewhere.  When you are in Town Square though, go here to enjoy some decent sushi.  Just be prepared to wait an extended period of time at all phases of your dining experience.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 15/100"}
{"text":"Came here after the movies and it was just like my rating which was ok....  We didn't a whole lot of sushi that night but we had two apps, a salad and an entree.  The apps were pretty good along with the salad, but that beef cooked hibachi style was a little weird.  I know the taste of hibachi being raised in hawaii, but that tasted like it was put in the oven, cooked well done, and rubbery.    Service wise it was ok, we went in pretty late so we tried to make haste, but they were still pretty friendly."}

{"text":"if ninja is the suckiest place to eat japanese, then kabuki is the welcomed breath of fresh air that i needed.  usually when you go to the new fancy shmancy over-the-top decor restaurants the food is lacking.  much to my surprise, this place was decent.  we ordered sushi and entrees (i forgot to take pix) and it was really decent tasting semi-fusion-ish japanese food.  a bit on the pricey side but at least it tasted pretty good.  where ninja's keystone cop waitresses lacked, kabuki waitresses did very well.  they were appropriately attentive, nice, but not hovering or annoying.  we had the 5'10'' former WNBA waitress who was pleasant and cordial.  i know that the tempe mktplace is taking a lotta hits on how crappy it is but i was pleasantly surprised at the outdoor mall area.  there's this cool conversation pit by a gas fireplace in front of barnes and noble.  very family friendly and hopping on a friday nite.  my 15 m/o daughter was mesmerized by the water fountains and dancing water displays.    8 months of the year this place would be a great place to walk and hang out.  i hope it doesn't become a 1 hit wonder and fall to the way of the other malls of the past."}
{"text":"My new favorite Japanese restaurant to go to.  Everything was delicious.  I had a combination plate, teriyaki chicken with tempura. They give a lot of food.

{"text":"I used to come here more often but not so much anymore since they changed their menu about a year ago (with most of it still being the same) and with the service quality seeming to go down quite a bit. The food overall is pretty decent, about a 3.5/5 for me, but the service is always so hit or miss... it's either good and attentive, or quite lacking and sass-filled. It's mostly because of the impertinent waitresses that I get half the time that I don't really come here very often anymore; the food is mostly good and decently priced, but I usually feel more comfortable going other places. On a positive note they do have pretty clean bathrooms though, lol."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food as always! Ashley, the waitress is very friendly and does an excellent job. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here are couple of times. Food is good and service is kind of disorganized. There are so many tables and not enough staff. They aren't really attentive when you need the check.   Also I stopped going after an incident in the bathroom. One of the waitresses came out of the stall while I was heading in and she didn't even wash her hands! Talk about disgusting. And yes, she used the bathroom, flushed the toilet, but did not wash her hands before leaving.... Never went back. It's been about 4 or 5 months since I've eating there."}
{"text":"Went to kabuki after a play date at tivoli. We had 9 and were able to sit shortly after the table was prepared. It's kid friendly and they have a kids menu. The service is typical of any chain restaurant, attentive and responsive. I am always skeptical of mainstream Japanese restaurants who try to serve an extensive menu. They had both cooked food, sushi and ramen/udon. The lunch specials were reasonably priced with a few good options. My daughter loves udon and it passed her taste test with flying colors. I had the hamachi Kama or yellowtail collar the size was more than enough but maybe a little over cooked and the ponzu a little off for my taste. We also had the chicken salmon teriyaki combo which was a little overcooked too but a great portion for the price. We have high expectations for sushi so I rarely order from chain type restaurants so we didn't here. We are ramen snobs as well so unless it's recommended or a specialty item and not on the last page of the menu like it was here we stay away. They had a good selection of rolls so this might be a good place for the casual sushi eater. I would suggest this restaurant as a good lunch spot for the lunch and happy hour menu. They have good mainstream Japanese selections but nothing that exceeded my relatively high expectations. Overall good enough. We'll be back"}
{"text":"They sat us in the back for 1hr no service after we called ahead for reservations we couldn't tell you if the food was good we left"}
{"text":"Went there my 1st time (and date :P) and it was mad busy but David took care of us, really a great guy and was friendly for trying it out. Drinks were good and food was good. Definitely would return again."}
{"text":"a little pricey but definitely worth it..the sushi was amazing..everything was fresh..great service and awesome location..I got the 50$ deal and it's the smartest way to order :) will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Bottom line....the mushy rice means 2 stars...done.  Owners, are you reading the reviews?  Mushy rice seems to be a popular critique."}
{"text":"I came here Wednesday for Happy Hour and I actually arrived with only 10 minutes to spare. The waitress made sure that my happy hour order went happily. I got two drinks, a ginger beer (incredible) and a Tokyo mojito (decent). In addition, I got my most prized roll \"The Alaskan\" and a few other not so memorable Items. This includes their Tokyo steam pork buns and the dynamite appetizer. The experience was simple with good service. The place was a bit cramped because every rolls gets served on a different large white plate. I think they need to consolidate some rolls because I felt like I was playing Tetris with my table space.  Anyways, aside from the space hurdle, everything was pleasant. I'd definitely return and make sure to come back during happy hour."}
{"text":"I been to a lot of sushi places in my time and really wasn't impressed here. It a little after lunch and not many customers.   So I had the Alaskan and the Lotus rolls. Alaskan I didn't even finish just wasn't all that great. Then had the Lotus which was California Roll with Cooked lobster on top. Ok Hot and Cook just eh plus the cream sauce with the mix of hot and cold was really wasn't pleasing. Then order the Yaki (Beef on Sticks) eh just no flavor.   Being in Vegas you figure places would step it up cause their are some many places to go. One would think they would put forth the effort to really do something to wow a customer.   HOLY RAW FISH BATMAN, CATWOMAN WON'T GO IN THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in tonight for dinner. All restaurants in the vicinity had a 50 min+ wait. Kabuki could seat us immediately at the sushi bar. Done! We were soon stuffed with sushi, spicy tuna rolls, teriyaki beef and chicken.  Miso soup and salad were great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi spot. Their lotus on fire rolls are amazing . The setting is nice and calm. Their bar tenders and servers are extremely knowledgable about the menu."}
{"text":"We stopped by the restaurant today for lunch and had quite a few questions and modification on the menu and our server Susana went above and beyond to ensure all of our questions were answered and our meals were what we wanted. She was very thorough and knew the menu very well and even offered alternatives that were more cost efficient for what we wanted. She provided excellent service and we are appreciative of that. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this week and I am pleasantly surprised. The meat was tender and delicious and the service was great. We tried the beef and chicken teriyaki with brown rice and a side of dumplings. I loved every bite. Great for date night or whenever you just want really good food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Always good food and usually fantastic service. Happy hour is the best time to go. We go often."}
{"text":"Kabuki isn't a place I go for sushi often. I have my favorite places for sushi but I was at Tempe market place and it seemed like a good idea at the time.  The food itself is okay. It isn't great but it isn't horrible. It's the same quality as other chain Japanese restaurants. I had spicy miso ramen, which lacked in spiciness but had a good flavor. It lacked in substance though. They could really dress up the ramen other than few strands of seaweed, little bit of sweet corn tossed in and handful of bean sprouts.   The rolls were okay. Spicy albacore left a lot of spicy to be desired, salmon was fatty and good, just lacked a lot of flavor. The eel was tough and overcooked, not to mention there were still bones so I had to be careful with it.   Service was good. The waitress was fast and very polite. Definitely good service.  I sat at the sushi bar with my boyfriend and let's talk about the sushi chefs. There were 3 working while I was there, Oscar, Sam and Josh. Oscan was hispanic and Sam and Josh were Korean (I promise this will matter in just a minute). I was so offended and disgusted with Josh's behavior. I'm Korean myself and speak the language fluently. I guess Josh assumed I didn't because he and Sam were speaking in Korean and Josh REPEATEDLY cursed and called Sam a derogatory name. Oscar of course did not speak Korean and when he said something to Josh (nothing bad, just about the food), Josh called him another derogatory name in Korean. I could tell from their interaction Oscar was used to Josh saying something to him in Korean and not knowing what it was. Josh just kept talking like that to his coworkers, even going into his dislike for the current job. I came to enjoy a nice lunch. Did I have to sit there and listen to this? I don't care if you think I don't speak Korean. The fact that the chef can stand there in front of customers and belittle his coworkers and talk like that is completely disrespectful. Not to mention there was another couple at the sushi bar and he talked about them as well.   An employee was refilling my drink and he was not dressed like the wait staff so I asked if he was the manager and he said he was. I told him I didn't appreciate having to eat my lunch in an environment where the chef is cursing throughout my lunch and he said he will talk to them. He didn't even ask me which chef it was and instead, right in front of me, asked to see Sam. Sam went behind the curtain with the manager and within seconds, Josh followed Sam. They all came back less than a minute later and that was it. Sam and Josh was smiling and laughing when they came back to behind the bar.  This was truly an absurd lunch. I will personally never return to Kabuki but if you do go, be sure to sit in the dining room, not the sushi bar, especially if you speak Korean!"}
{"text":"The style is very modern and trendy. Pretty cool looking.  You are offered sushi bar, table or booth when you walk in. I chose a table. I never want to sit at the bar invade I don't like the roll I don't want them to see my sour face.   My server was really nice and attentive when I first sat down and then when my food came he dropped off. I've been sitting here for ten minutes waiting for a Togo box and my check. I understand he is busy with the demanding table across from me. So other than that great service.   The food was great. The fried dumplings were really good. Served on top of their sauce with some lettuce stuff in the middle. They give you complimentary edamame. Which was nice. Then my fried California roll came (I don't remember the name of it). But it was really good. I was so stuffed I only ate half and brought the other half to my co-worker. I would come back! Especially during happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Last night was a girls night out. We all got together for dinner at around 7-7:30, within two min we were asked about our drink orders and we were browsing through the menu. Having not had sushi for a while, I went straight to the sushi section, particularly the specialty items. The ladies were also mostly interested in ordering sushi as well. There were quite a few to choose from, it took us a while to decide. I was not interested in eating any raw items so I made sure I selected the cooked rolls. Also since I'm on a dairy free diet, I had to choose the ones that didn't have cream cheese in them, still, I had quite a variety to choose from.  After taking some time to review the ingredients of all the rolls, I decided to order the lobster roll, the dynamite, as well as the king crab roll. The ladies ordered other items and one of us particularly ordered the sushi rolls with soy paper. Some ladies ordered appetizers too.  While waiting for our food to come, the appetizers were served and we were served 2 bowls of edamame. The edamame was good but it was cold. I have never had cold edamame before so it was fine but I prefer the hot one.  A little while later, our sushi rolls were served. All the items ordered on our table looked delicious. I tried the dynamite roll first and after trying my other two orders, dynamite was my favorite. The rolls were of a suitable size so I was full after eating only half of my order. During our dinner, our waitress came back to check on us and offer us refills. Her service was great.  Overall, a good experience. The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I would like to take my husband there to try it soon. 4 stars rather than 5 bcz I wasn't absolutely blown away and because some ladies including myself complained that the rolls were falling apart. Will return however and try more items on the menu. Definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"So here's my review on ANY sushi restaurant.  It's good.    For some reason all sushi tastes the same to me. I don't know if I've ever had bad sushi, I don't know if I've ever had good sushi. Kubuki is a nice place, the wait staff was very attentive, and the sushi was good. I ordered some hot fire roll and a BIG roll. It was good.  Nothing more than to give this place a solid C."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, I have definitely had better. A group of friends and I came here on our lunch break. We work in one of the Glendale arenas, so it was a walking-distance option for lunch.   For the lunch crowd, Kabuki is extremely deserted. As are most other places at this time in Westgate. Despite the lack of a crowd, we were only allowed to sit at the sushi bar, which was a little awkward for a group of 6, considering you have to yell across the bar to withhold conversation...   Anyhow, I'm not going to make this a novel of any sorts. I ordered one of their lunch specials, which was advertised to come with 6 nigiri pieces of sushi, a california roll, and a soup or salad. I asked my waitress if I could sub out the shrimp nigiri for salmon, and she said yes but for a dollar upcharge. I agreed... For $14.99, the portion could have been MUCH more generous. The California roll was small and came with 6 1-inch diameter rolls that were haphazardly put together. The nigiri was okay, but the tuna definitely was not the freshest it could have been. My miso soup that I ordered with the meal was good, but seemed to be overpowered with tofu chunks (about half of the soup was tofu). I also ordered a side of steamed rice, which was advertised at a dollar, but the waitress rang it in as sushi rice which was a dollar expensive and not what I ordered. Needless to say, I left hungry.   The quality of the sushi is alright at best. The portion size compared to price is laughable. Compared to other places I know that have similar lunch specials, I was disappointed to say the least. I really wanted to like Kabuki, but sadly, I do not."}
{"text":"While visiting family in vegas we came in with a group of 6 people, and not one of us was blown away. I ordered the soy ramen, the broth was amazing, but they noodles & hard boiled egg were both over cooked. Another person in our group got teriyaki chicken and remarked that we can get better for much less money in the middle of no where new mexico.  The atmosphere and the service were both nice, no complaints in either of those departments but nothing spectacular either.  If your thinking of coming here I'd suggest looking for a little mom & pop shop instead, the food will probably be better and so will the prices."}
{"text":"It was better than what I expected. On the way to a late night movie decided to grab a late dinner. I've been to too many bad sushi places in the past month, and this meal really impressed me."}
{"text":"i went to glendale for hockey game.. felt like Asian food so I happened to find Kabuki near the stadium... it was very busy assume because it was a game night... ambiance was great, food -especially seabass- was excellent. However, service really made our dinner.. hostess had bright smile, server seemed busy but focused on our table. Also the manager constantly walked by and acknowledged us.  it was great in all area!"}
{"text":"I only gave 2 stars because the waiter was nice and the sushi was fair.  We were a party of 5. 4 of us had the chicken and beef hibachi.  GROSS!  Steak and chicken were tasteless, we had to ask for salt and pepper for the table to try to add flavor.....no help.  The dipping sauces tasted like cleaning solutions. AVOID this place.  Ohjah at Decatur/Blue Diamond is 10 times better.  I guess the only way they are still in business is because of the tourists that pass through and get suckered into this place."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend spend $100 for lunch+tip lol! Kinda expensive but youll get what you pay for. Good quality food and great services. You should check out lunch menu and happy hours cuz they got a good deal."}
{"text":"After years of coming to kabuki, we unfortunately had a bad experience. It was our 27th wedding anniversary and we wanted to celebrate it by staying at the Renaissance and going over to westgate to have dinner. When we walked in they acted as if we hadn't made reservations and told us it would be 45 min. I restated our last name and they then found it. The waiter gave us our menus and walked away. then a waitress came over and  asked if we wanted something to drink, but that it would take 20 minutes because a large party of people had shown up at the bar, that was fine, we were seated outside and it was hot but the misters were running. After we got our food my first drink came out. I sipped on it and at about being 2/3rds  of the way done with it, the waiter asked how we were doing, I said could I please order another drink. He said Arizona State law says we cannot serve a second drink until the first drink is finished. I looked up at him and said\"what?\" He went into further detail. Yes folks, did you all know about the law and ordering a second drink? Just to prove a point I chugged my drink. He said I didn't mean for you to do that, then my husband being the guy he is went to talk to the manager because he could see our night was being ruined by the wannabe chaparon waiter. The manager was even worse, would not listen said we we desrespectful to the waiter (because we were upset he was being rude to us) he called security, but we had already walked out after the manager absolutely would not listen to me. Not one word. Horrible manager. I wanted to cry. Here's the deal, if a restaurant wants to make a point that drinks would be coming out slowly, then scoff if you want to order one in advance so it is timed to come out when you finish the first one,  what's so bad about that? Unfortunately I have to air my greavence here because I am so angry my anniversary was basically ruined, and the manager was unwilling to listen to my complaint. Never going back. Unless the get a new manager, but how would I know? They've opened up new sushi bar in the same block, taking our business there."}
{"text":"The sushi is great!  So many different rolls.  I usually get the hamachi box roll.  That's always my favorite."}
{"text":"The customer service was great this time. Po, our server was really attentive.  Jay and Denny working the sushi bar were really kind.  Hiro, the kitchen manager, was comiing and going making sure everything was perfect.  Had a great time.   Love the happy hour specials... and the green tea ice cream is amazing."}
{"text":"Very good place, Tim is by far the best server i've ever had, very professional! Lobster roll is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great lunch, reasonable prices!  It was a bit tricky to find in the Town Square Mall but Google Maps got us there for a car drop off doorside. We had chirasi rice, salmon poke bowl, tonkatsu combination (tonkstsu and shrimp tempura) and teriyaki salmon combination (salmon and shrimp tempura). The flavors were nice, nothing extraordinary. Our total bill with tip came to $80. This included four drinks, one of which was a beer. I would return here again."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SUSHI! I also had the BBQ Ribs appetizer with a side of steamed rice. Outstanding service and the food was brought out with a quickness!! I'll definitely be back when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Located in Town Square, this Kabuki is my favorite Japanese fusion restaurant. we ordered a player of sushi that was so so delicious, some plum wine (sweet), their chicken teriyaki is the BOMB! I love the teriyaki sauce they prepare it's plummy and very flavorful Philadelphia roll is my little appetizer Pêche Mignon   Their home salad is good and ginger dressing is so yummy. staff is pleasant. The restaurant has a patio area and a nice bar sitting area as well. They have a happy hour from 4pm to 6pm and after 9pm week day."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently.  Very nice atmosphere and good service.  Dishes from kitchen were excellent.  Gyoza were crisp and tasty.  Great sauce. Slightly spicy with sesame.  Miso soup excellent. My wife's teriyaki and tempura was plentiful and quite well done.  Tempura was lightly coated and dried perfectly.  Unfortunately sushi was poor.  Now the actual fish was fresh and tasted fine if somewhat dull. Rice was poorly seasoned.  And it fell apart when you went to eat.  Every piece I picked up the rice just broke apart.  Spicy tuna roll was not spicy and mostly just mushy tuna.  None of the sushi had any wasabi or flavoring. Just hunk a fish sat on top of a misshapen ball of rice.  I struggled with rating.  The kitchen won out.  I would definitely come back but not for sushi. There are too many good sushi places in town for them to serve this stuff here.  Really a shame as this had great potential."}
{"text":"This is the sushi spot I go to when I'm craving sushi.. Which is almost 80% of the time. I usually opt for the bar because we don't have to wait to get seated and plus because the drinks are over there. Sushi here is great and staff are nice and friendly. My only complaint is that they don't have a lion king roll! Lion King roll is my absolute favorite roll. That was practically all I would ever get when I lived in California. But ever since I moved to Vegas, a lot of sushi places don't carry it. And when I asked them if they had a lion king roll the bartender told me they removed it from the menu. Super sad face! But other than that, sushi is good, service is good, and drinks are good!"}
{"text":"The food at Kabuki is out of this world. I'm have yet to eat anything there that I dislike. The servers and managers are very helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience. The happy hour is worth it just on the chu-hi alone. Try the Aladdin Roll! The spicy tuna was the one flaw, due to it not being any different than other places I've been. A great after work or lunch spot."}
{"text":"Long over due and must needed \"5\" star review. I have been dining here for past few years for lunch and dinner. Each experience keeps getting better. The food and portion size are defiantly a great value. I have loved almost every item I have tried here excluding one which is not the restaurant fault I have to blame my palate. Surprisingly I am not a big beef person but after trying their version of the teriyaki beef this is now a must order. The sushi is always fresh and the hot appetizers come out at the perfect temperature. My favorite is the sweet potato fries.   I have always loved the service. The wait staff is busy but not too busy to bring value to the experience. There is always a friendly manager on staff who is always thankful for the business.   This is a great date night, girls night, party of 5, quick lunch, and much more type of restaurant. It is geared towards all types of  Asian Fusion taste buds. The large menu of items allows everyone to pick what they like most. This is dining spot you won't get bored with because there is always a wide variety to choose from. The only issue is what to order next because it is easy to get hooked on the same things.   Be sure to check out the Happy Hour Menu. Trust me you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Amazing Service and Sushi- I have been here on multiple occasions and I have zero complaints!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely the best ! Honestly my favorite place to come to even with a far drive . The food is so good every time, all my friends and family love the food and environment. The manager huy is amazing and the staff an waiters every time are happy to see us and give great service . I highly recommend this. Restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have the best reviews, because I had a marvelous experience in the restaurant. The interior was fantastic, the waiter checked on us very often, and the food was great. I didn't have the sushi because I wasn't feeing it, but had the rice bowl that I enjoyed very much. Sure, the prices were higher compared to some restaurants, but it is located in Tempe Marketplace and quality sushi is served. Also, for $7, my friend got a huge glass of wine. Those concerned with the prices should check out the happy hour menu- they have a variety of great foods! I'll have to go back to try the sushi."}
{"text":"So the food was good, the host was awesome and of course the decor was really cool. But then just when you thought ok, this can't get any better. In walks \" The Axe Murderer\" Wanderlei Silva that is :)... The guy was with his family so naturally i left him alone. But as a fan of the MMA it was still pretty cool to see the man, the myth , the axe murderer in person.   The spring rolls were so-so, but everything else was really good. Our service was quick so that was a huge plus. I might be back, if so ill definitely order the king crab roll again."}
{"text":"I think the many positive reviews of this place is more for the ambience and location than the food. It's not bad. Decent, predictable Japanese fare with little innovation, and not flawlessly executed. Entrees were lacking in flavor or else were salty. Not a deal breaker on a Saturday night if you want to enjoy Tivoli and a bottle of sake with a good friend and have a hankering for Japanese. But it's less than nothing to write home about. The service is, well, serviceable."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good Japanese restaurant in the area this is definitely the place to go.  Great staff, great service, delicious food and amazing atmosphere.  Not overpriced like other Asian food places.  Had the Las Vegas roll and my husband had the salmon teriyaki from the lunch menu. The food came out really quick and we could see that everything was really fresh.  Keep up with the nice work guys. Definitely coming back to try other rolls."}
{"text":"I have two words for you: Lychee Mojito. The awesome drinks and the great deals make Kabuki one of my favorite default places for happy hour. Not an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant but I find many of their items pretty tasty. The Lotus on Fire and Hamachi Box are my go-to rolls. The food presentation is great and did I mention they have awesome happy hour specials?"}
{"text":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjpkXoiN-Y  Not only did it take 30 minutes to be seated, it took another 30 to get our drinks.  And an hour on top of that to get our food.  Once we got the food, we were interrupted by a server who had dropped a card in the slot between the table and the window.  Instead of reseating us, they actually made half of the dinner party stand around and wait for them to dig for about 20 minutes.  When the manager approached us after the fact, he offered us dessert.  We had our own cake because it was a going away party...so then he decided to offer us ice cream like that would solve the problem.  No thanks.  Oh wait, then he asked us if we wanted a candle...no...it's not a birthday and none of us are turning 1.  So then he ASKS if we want a discount.  Well, considering the fact we couldnt even enjoy the meal, one should have automatically been given.  No need to ask.  Horrible service.  Horrible experience.  At least I had an awesome group of people with me!!!!  I will never return to Kabuki.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"We come here probably once a week and I want to update my review for a  5 stars experience. Our server Ly tipped the scales. I have been trying new dishes and there was one I didn't like (probably not Americanized enough for me) lol but Ly exchanged it and made me happy. Great experience and we will be back"}
{"text":"It used to b one of my fav restaurant till tonight. (As u can see i placed 4th for check in to this place) The GM in Tempe has no skill in serving industry at all. He pretty much ruin our night over a $4 roll. He explained to us the yelp deal r only allow one per table (as we didnt know n we were using two coupons in same table but two separate checks like always) my friend joked to him n say he can take the order back since she didn't even eat hers. He replied with very rude attitude, \"yeah I can do that. I'm just gonna throw them away. But u can only use one coupon per table!\" So he took the order back along with my two extra piece (my leftover I didn't want) he rather end biz n pissed off their customer over $4 Cali roll...really?! All he did was prove his point-that he is right n customers r wrong.  I had never seen any service like that ever! Corp office will hear from me as soon as they open on Monday"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place and it always seems busy when I visit Tempe Marketplace. I just don't get it? They do give you free edamame and a 15% discount for showing your student ID but that's about all they have going for them. We ordered the Vegas (my usual staple) and the seaweed wrap was thick and hard to chew. Our other rolls seemed to have a mushy- not sticky- rice texture. The service was a bit slow and our waiter seemed out of it. Overall, we have spent less at sushi places for better quality. It's worth the 2 mile drive to SakeBombers!"}
{"text":"The food is great- the menu is endless! Service is subpar. (I've given it a few chances, every time the service seemed average/below average) Last night however it was awful! I won't rant on about it because the food makes up for it. Just wish the management would take a better look at who they're hiring and how they are training. 7/10"}
{"text":"If not for Sunny, a fabulous waitress who generally works lunches during the work week, I'm not sure that Kabuki would make the list as often as it does.  Their sushi, as other Yelpers point out, is average, though they do get creative with their rolls (the Lotus on Fire and Baha rolls are a nice change of pace).  I usually stick with the sashimi salad - a medley of salmon, tuna, white fish and whatever other raw goodies they have on hand that day - all in a bed of greens.  The other nice part about Kabuki: their frequent diner card. Every time you get 500 points, you get a gift certificate for $25.  Bottom line: Kabuki is a good go-to lunch spot, especially if you sit in Sunny's section!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is great because where Yardhouse and Blue Martini's menu lack in (Sushi) this place makes up for. Now, both spots have single items like the Poke stack or the spicy tuna roll, but Kabuki has it all. Great sake specials to go along with great food make this place a winner in my book."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at this place several months ago before I became vegan. I was pathetically hungover from a night of over-indulgence and was in desperate need of sake. I am convinced that sake is the quickest and least painful hangover cure. The bathroom was terribly dizzying given my current state. The \"door\" frames are at an odd angle, very Dr. Seuss and it made me feel strange inside! On to the food...  My boyfriend and I ordered the Love Boat. My goodness it was HUGE!!! The order included a soup, salad, and rice. The boat was loaded with: chicken teriyaki, BBQ beef ribs, shrimp and vegetable tempura, gyoza, muscles, three pieces of California Roll, and a \"seasonal\" roll. The quality was pretty good and we were both stuffed! Our waitress was prompt and pleasant (even though she accidentally spilled a bit of drink on my $30 (!) planner). There were plenty of leftovers to be had!"}
{"text":"Order to roll and a dynamite plate with a couple of drinks, we sat outside on the front patio service was good right there by the bar was a nice cool night and get the people watch as we ate and drank."}
{"text":"Great place for people watching and good food! We sat outside, there was some car show going on so we enjoyed live music and a festive hum in the air. Tried the sushi, tofu, sake sangria, sea bass, everything was unexpectedly good. I say unexpected because who goes inland to AZ for raw fish?? But I'm sure glad we did!"}
{"text":"We were on our way back from Rocky Point and needed to find some place to eat. We stopped at Westgate thinking there were a lot of places to eat. Although we picked Kabuki, I wasn't expecting much from a \"mall\" sushi place. I was really surprised at how good the speciality rolls were. The Hamachi was huge. They have Garlic Edamame too. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi but appearance is also important. The dining tables need some serious upgrade. They are actually sticky from the top coat paint peeling. It's kind of gross to look at.. it's all dirty and gum textured... especially if you're about to eat dinner it's not what you want to look at."}
{"text":"So went to Kabuki for my daughters 25th birthday celebration and Tim our waiter made our night excellent!!! He went above and beyond for us all to have great food & drinks and explain to my Mom (85) so many things about the Japanese food!! Never batted an eye at what we needed! We ended our night with the cake I brought for Kayla and he just got it all ready to serve!! Just so much fun yet professional! You should feel privileged to have Tim working there!!! Even though they don't serve bud light anymore I will go back more!!!  thanks again Tim"}
{"text":"I'm not someone who eats sushi- but usually I manage to find something  decent on the menu.  I always have beef teriyaki at sushi places... since their chicken for some reason is never white meat. It was more like steak though, not the beef I'm used to. I felt like I needed some A1 or bbq sauce...but you can never go wrong with miso soup- but it will never fill you up. So I woudn't recommend this place to people who don't like to eat raw flesh of fish that smell like the women's restroom. I'll give them this- tempura green tea ice cream- Amazing! I can live off of it. I would just have to get it to-go in order to escape that bathrom smell (sushi). yuck. lol"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been coming here for years and always bring company, friends, family, etc. None of them have ever been disappointed (which is surprising because a few of them are very hard to please.) I have never have bad sushi here and there are so many rolls that please!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be a minority here and give the place three stars.   I hate their uniforms (the servers look like their ready to go to bed in their pyjamas), but the service provided by the servers is quick. They're conscientious too as they came to our table often to give us more water.   The food is ok. When my parents ask where I want to eat for my birthday, I definitely wouldn't say Kabuki though. I'm watching my calories so the smaller portion sizes work well for me. The pricing is average imho.   Anyway, Kabuki does the trick.  Not sure when I'll go back, but I wouldn't start a hunger strike if someone invited me to go there."}
{"text":"Get the short ribs! They have a delicate sweetness to them that was amazing! The rice was very flavorful, though I'm used to larger portions of it at Japanese restaurants. The prices were very reasonable. My husband got teriyaki salmon and chicken. He loved it!"}
{"text":"I've tried the omakase sashimi special, the kabuki roll, as well as their green the cheesecake. Everything I've tried was more than what I could ask for. All their dishes were fresh and delicious. The waiters are extremely tentative which means cleaning plates off your table is quick, although, make sure you tell them if you aren't finished with plates if you are not because before you know it, they'll take your nearly empty plate away while your distracted with the delicious flavors of the foods while theyre asking if you're finished with the plate!"}
{"text":"Always incredible food, my favs are:  the chicken teriyaki lunch (amazing price for what you get)  spicy tuna roll (has chunks of tuna which is soooo yummy)  house salad with ginger dressing (so fresh and delicious)  and I haven't had better salmon nigiri anywhere else.  Thank you Kabuki for always being perfect every single time!!!!"}
{"text":"The two stars here are for the food and drinks. We came with a group and I am blown away at how rude the staff was. The server, hostess, even the manager. I don't think I'll be back. the food isn't good enough to warrant it."}
{"text":"Not a place for food.   I am very particular about my sushi, so I was pretty skeptical about trying out the sushi here. The options for sashimi weren't too tempting, so I thought I'd be brave and try out a roll since there were so many of them. A lot of them sounded pretty creative too.   I decided on the mori soba for half of my meal, and also ordered a AAA Box Sushi Roll. The mori soba was actually the perfect thing to get for a warm summer night. The soba noodles were perfectly cooked and the nori, ginger, and scallions that accompanied the tsuyu were plenty. The AAA box sushi, on the other hand, was the greatest disappointment of the night. It is called AAA because it includes layers of Avocado, Asparagus, Albacore, and of course, rice and nori. First of all, it took forever for this roll to come out. Everyone in the party had finished eating by the time this roll arrived. The server said that it takes a long time to make this roll, but there is the possibility that he may have forgotten to order it. The albacore and asparagus were barely noticeable. All you can taste was the rice, avocado, nori, and the sweet sauce they smothered the roll in.   This place definitely has a good atmosphere if you're just looking for a place to hang out and have some drinks. The customer service was a bit slow, but the server bought our birthday girl her drink, so that was cool."}
{"text":"This is only for the service ...Good service but food was not good...My eel maki was drowned in very salty teriyaki sauce...And the the tempura sushi rolls my friend ordered didn't even look like sushi it was so badly wrapped... Practically falling apart..."}
{"text":"Service is kinda hit and miss sometimes! But food is absolutely amazing! Great lunch spot to meet up with friends! Especially when the weather is perfect I recommend their patio!"}
{"text":"The portion is quite big and good.  I checked in on yelp and received a free appetizer.  The service is a bit slow but it worked out for us since we were there chatting with friends/family for a long time.  Definitely we will go back for more."}
{"text":"For a chain, it was pretty good. The Ramen i got was tasty.  The service is what really gets the ding here. I actually had to leave the table and ask the hostess for a fork because my table-mate asked 3 times and got looked over.  Drink refills were a chore as well.  I wish I could say it was so busy that we just lost some service.  However, growing up in the restaurant industry, this was NOT a busy, Wednesday night."}
{"text":"I've gone here on a date with my bf on 4 separate occasions, one of them being our very first date.   Kabuki is a place we go to more for the ambiance than the food really. I mean the food is good, but not great. This place provides more of a romantic setting than great food and service.  My favorite things to eat here are the garlic edemame, tempura ice cream, and salmon terriyaki entree.  All in all I'd say 4.5 stars for the ambiance and 3 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Sadly  this isn' t as good the second time as the first time. The first time I was here the food seemed fresh and light and I really enjoyed a Volcano Sushi/ Tartare  dish .. mmmm  but this time ..what happened   ?  The service was okay although for as empty as the place was , it seemed a  bit slow for refills and checking in.   Akward sushi service , we were sitting at the bar and suddenly get  all our sushi at once on all different plates  ahhh  where do we put them , and no one has cleared our appetizer plates???   The rolls were big but sadly unmemorable.... something fried , something spicy tuna ish ,,blah blahdy  blah...  you get the picture.  The good ole boys sitting next us were kind of fun to watch. They were singing country songs, while watching football , cramming too big of pieces of sushi in their mouths..  It's not good when the slanted bathrooms are the most memorable part of your restaurant.  Doubt I 'll be back."}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars but my waiter tried to charge me for a few cucumber pieces for my water.  food was good overall though."}
{"text":"I LOVE KABUKI. I would go during happy hour, lunch or dinner. My husband and I go to here quite often, mostly for lunch or happy hour. I love Town Square - what a great location for a restaurant like this. They have a great lunch menu with reasonable prices for the quality of food you receive. One of my favorite parts? THEY ARE GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!!!  On the bottom of the menu they state that they offer gluten free soy sauce and brown rice. I like brown rice better than white and since I'm gluten free, this is a definite plus. This means their staff is somewhat knowledgeable about gluten allergies. finding that at a sushi restaurant. I normally get one of their nigiri and sushi specials at lunch, brown rice, no wasabi (I am not sure if it is GF and not worth the risk), with just a hit of gluten free soy sauce and maybe a little ginger. Delicious. Of course, I cannot get any of those fancy rolls that are fried and dripping in calories, but that's okay! The fish I can have is fresh, delicious, not stinky and totally fulfilling in every way. Wash it down with a sake and you're good to go!  My husband gets the teriyaki chicken and tempura lunch special every time we go. He loves the tempura because it isn't too greasy, just a right amount of crunch and perfectly cooked every time. The teriyaki chicken is his favorite because it isn't too sweet, isn't drowned in too much sauce and is once again, perfectly cooked. It comes with a bowl of miso soup and a bowl of rice, so by the end of the meal he is absolutely full, and to get a 6' 7\" man full in one sitting with one plate without making him want to vomit due to MSG overload? Good times.  Come during any hour, but a lot of people love happy hour at Kabuki. Great roll specials and appetizer specials, but I'm a big fan of the large hot sake for $3. After a long day, it's nice to wind down with a large sake and a spicy tuna roll. The prices are great, service is consistently good and I love the location and ambiance. All around, this place is delicious and perfect any time of the day."}
{"text":"Happy hour 3pm-6pm and reverse 8pm to close. And I love the fact they have happy hr on Sunday n is fantastic. I'll recommend you gold rush, Alaska roll, and Philly roll this r my top 3. Peach sikitini its amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place and can't wait to return.  Disclaimer: we sat at the bar so we could watch the game, & when I walked through the restaurant to go to the bathroom, I got a \"cafeteria\" vibe from the place because it was so big, crowded, and noisy.  Not sure I would want to sit in the restaurant section honestly.  But the bartenders were great, and the sushi was awesome.  My 2 new favorite rolls (Baja roll & Lotus on Fire roll), YUM."}
{"text":"sushiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!   So I've come here a couple times and so far I've had a really good experience. The first time I sat at the bar and we ordered a couple rolls and some drinks. My favorite roll was the baja. It's a little spicy but so yummy. It's a spicy crab roll with a tomato salsa on top. My go to is always avocado roll. It's just simple and good and makes me happy. I've also tried the AAA box roll. It had good ingredients but when picking it up it would fall completely apart. Not so much fun. We had a couple other rolls the first time I went but nothing that stuck out at me. I went a second time with a group of friends. We grab a table and ordered our favorites to share. My friend Paris and Sam do this cute weird thing where they eat their first and last piece together... AWWW!! But that is besides the point. Paris ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll and a lotus on fire. Both were amazing. She even ate the flower. I'm a huge fan of crunch so anything with tempura crumbs is a win. My friend Theresa ordered her favorite. She got the dragon roll. It came out and I was in such awe I forgot to take a picture. It looked just like a dragon!! It also tasted like chicken. Very good. The most talked about was the Kabuki roll. Sam ordered this and had it mostly to her self, however I did try one of the orange egg looking things.. It was weird. Not my thing. My baja roll for this trip came out last and I though it would be a good idea to just stuff my face. I however did not chew the roll all the way and almost died. I had to step outside and spit out the roll before I choked. The pieces I ate after that we chew thoroughly. Kabuki has been good to me so far (aside from almost dying). Paris ended our meal by eating the flower from my bay breeze. What a crazy gal."}
{"text":"We go here all the time.  Thought we'd be safe at 9pm on a non game night but even though there was seats for at least 20 available, the hostess told us it'd be a 45 minute wait.  We finally found seats in the bar area but help never came so I went up to the bar to place our drink and food order.  I was told they didn't have large Sapporo so i asked for 2 small ones for the price of one large (makes sense) and was told they couldn't do that.  The frazzled bartender, Nick, then told me to talk to a manger and I complained about the poor service and he said that's how it was on a Saturday night.  I found this strange since, like I said, there were a ton of open seats and it wasn't busy at all.  I then told him they wouldn't get out money and he said that was just fine.  So sad.  We loved this place, we even have a Red Mask card.  Most people don't even know what that is.  We will likely cut up the Red Mask card and never go here again."}
{"text":"We had a gift card and decided to celebrate the last day of school with a yummy sushi dinner.  Never having been to Kabuki, we were unsure what to expect as some of the sushi restaurants in town offer a nice environment with terrible food and service.   Kabuki was quite the opposite (w/a very nice environment). The menu selection (including kids menu) is excellent and the sushi is melt in your mouth delicious! We had the Vegas Roll, Sunkissed Roll and the Lotus Roll. The sunkissed roll is by far my favorite and a must try for anyone thinking about trying this place out.   The service was quick and pleasant without feeling rushed. The dining room is quite large so you don't feel cramped into a small restaurant that reeks of fish. No fishy smell here! The prices are reasonable as well! With an extensive sake menu and lots more specialty rolls to try, we will definitely find something else to celebrate so that we can go back soon!"}
{"text":"It's good, the location is good, the service is good, the prices are well, high, I was able to eat mostly off of the Happy Hour menu and that made it worth while.  We tried several things without having to take a loan out on my first born, and our waitress started having fun with us at the end.  I will say this, if you go and drink, be careful of the bathroom, the designer/architect is messing with you head.  I'm seriously thinking of hosting a party and paying for several rounds of drinks just to get some great YouTube videos of people coming and going into the bathroom here."}
{"text":"I came here during lunch and found the food to be very good.  Though I only had the chance to order a lunch special of teriyaki chicken with miso soup and tempura shrimp, I was in a bit of a hurry and really did not get a chance to enjoy the whole dining experience.  I would like to return at a time when I can actually look at the menu and order something a little more unique.  Only then will I really get an idea of what I think of this place.  I can say the service was excellent."}
{"text":"awesome happy hour! 1.95 beers, cheap sake bombs, baked mussels are my fave"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! One of my favorite places in all of Las Vegas. Plus a great place for date night with your girlfriend!"}
{"text":"Sushi was the worst...who puts mayo on a roll... Not even the Japanese do this!!  Its def. a chain restaurant. Got to the place about 10 mins before the happy hour was over and the waitress wouldnt let us order.. WTF is that about?"}
{"text":"So I gave Kabuki 4 stars. I think if I was just looking for sushi I would probably consider a few others first but for overall experience and other Japanese cuisine it would be in my rotation.  I had the spicy tuna app and it was pretty good, spice came on a bit later but not overpowering. The miso soup was honestly one of the better versions I have had. The two guys with me ordered a lunch plate that I don't recall the name but wow it was a ton of food. I had a dragon roll and it was pretty good, great presentation.   Service was very good and I'm sure I will return as it's one of the better options in Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd.    Kabuki was delicious!  My wife and I stopped by here spur of the moment while walking by and were very impressed.  I ordered a phili roll, spicy tuna roll, and a crunch roll and loved all of them.   My wife ordered a chicken/beef teriyaki dish that was amazing as well.  The ambience is amazing, service was 10/10, and price was definitely reasonable.  I highly recommend giving Kabuki a try."}
{"text":"Decent Japanese food. The menu has a lot of variety with even vegetarian options to satisfy a majority of people's food preferences. If you're a sushi connoisseur, stick with the other items on the menu. The salmon entree and the udon are solid meals that are tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Good sushi rolls. They did modify the rolls for us so they were a bit more healthy, at no charge. Service was pleasant."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's in Tivolo Village and very easy to find.   I highly recommend the Happy Hour if you like basic rolls and don't want the cream cheese-avocado-fried crawfish-salmon roe-rainbow tuna bomb; Happy Hour takes a dollar or two off of rolls you would already eat, like spicy tuna and salmon.   The calamari here is surprisingly good. Very tender and light.  My friend got two of the cream cheese-avocado-fried crawfish-salmon roe-rainbow tuna bomb rolls of sorts, and they were both delicious and large portions. One thing they do not do here is skimp on the fish and ingredients inside a roll. I feel like you do get your money's worth.  With every meal they bring out edamame for free. While I do ignore these large-and-by, other people really enjoy having them, so that's always a perk. My friends like the garlic edamame here, which you do have to pay for.  I also came here for lunch once, and the Korean short rib lunch is really good. Reheats nicely for the next day and a good portion of food. Perfectly lightly sweet but not too sweet.   Food here is simple but done well. Atmosphere is nice, and they are doing so well it looks like they are expanding to next door as well. I think it's a solid pick for a first date ."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a drink.  We missed happy hour, but having a vodka soda was pretty affordable.   I ordered the ramen with pork belly.  The broth wasn't incredibly flavorful, but the pork belly made up for it.  I just loved it!    Service was fine."}
{"text":"My friends really like this place and think it's the best sushi place in Arizona. However, I don't know how that compares to places back home in CA. I would say for a pricey sushi place, they are pretty good and the rolls are surprisingly really well done. I'm not big on raw fish, so I pretty much only eat spicy tuna rolls if I do, and it tastes pretty good. It was my first time going, so we shared a bunch of stuff. We had gyoza (I've had better elsewhere), edamame, ca roll, shrimp tempura roll, sunkissed roll (spicy tuna w salmon and avocado), unagi roll, baja roll (Ca roll with salsa on top which was surprisingly good), and a baked lobster roll (ca rolls with baked lobster) and it was really good. They have decent priced sake bombs and their beers are huge, so almost worth the $10. I really liked the lychee mojito, although it was more on the sweet side than the alcoholic side. They brought out a cake and those 5 yr old birthday party hats for my friend and made him look like a dork, so that made it an even better time =)"}
{"text":"This is now my new favorite place. Tonight will be the third night in a row my husband will be dining here. We stopped in on whim while strolling Tivoli and I'm so glad we did. It was love at first bite. Hubs has a gluten sensitivity so the first time he was weary and stuck to what he knows. The second time, I brought his sensitivity to the attention of our waiter, Josh. He was the absolute best ever! He immediately moved the soy sauce to my side of the table and brought my husband a bottle of gluten free soy sauce just for him. He then made sure all of my husband's dishes were properly prepared and ensured the dishes he and I were sharing were gluten free as well. The husband has had the seaweed salad, the sashimi salad, and a bunch of the basic rolls (salmon, 2 kinds of tuna, and scallop), which he says were incredible. We shared the chicken hibachi rice (GF) on the second night. I didn't think it tasted any different than the order I had the night before, when I didn't share with him, so I was really pleasantly surprised. I had the cucumber salad which was prepared different than I'm used to since it was prepared with no rice wine. Instead they use a ponzu sauce and sesame oil. It's different. Very unique. I can't explain how delicious it is. It's right up there with the outstanding cucumber salad from Andrea's, at Wynn (which is the best rice wine one). I've also ordered the yakisoba twice. Both times with chicken instead of beef. The first time regular chicken yakisoba. The second time I asked them to personalized it for me. I ordered it with no bean sprouts and no onions and no garnish (basically just chicken breast, yakisoba noodles and cabbage) and they made it perfectly. It's the best yakisoba I've had in Vegas so far (it's my favorite dish so I get it everywhere I can).   TLDR; best overall dining experience in a while. This place will cater to your food sensitivity and allergy needs, as well as cater to your food needs even if your just a picky and simple girl like me. Also try the strawberry lemonade. They make it fresh in house and it is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Good food at a good price for the lunch specials anyway. Efficient service, great portions for lunch specials for like $11. I thought it was quite reasonable and the quality and presentation were great. I would definitely come back again. The menu was fine, teriyaki, sushi, short ribs, tempura, but nothing that creative or special."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Kabuki. The sushi menu isn't creative and most of the specialty rolls are California rolls topped off with fish. When the waitress brought me my sushi noticed it was the wrong roll. I finally got the right roll and it was so hard to eat because it kept on falling apart. The waitress never apologized and that kind of bugged me because I waited a long time for my food. My friend ordered the Vegas roll and it was good. If my friends drag me here again I'll probably order that."}
{"text":"Great food great service! Everything we had was good from the sushi to the tempura! Staff was very friendly! Would definitely come back and the price was very reasonable.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.  Great job keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Good service, amazing portions for salmon nigiri. Huge fan of the friendliness of staff. Wasabi cream sauce for calamari is awesome. Not to mention the calamari itself is delic! I gotta say this place doesn't disappoint. I'll be back again! Yum!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my bday with my family and everyone enjoyed their dinner! It was a nice touch when the staff came and sang Japanese song to me!"}
{"text":"My DH and I were CRAVING teriyaki chicken for lunch today so thought we would try out Kabuki at Westgate. This establishment is in no relation to Kabuki Sushi and Grill in Peoria...and after todays experience I would have been shocked to find out otherwise.  Upon entering, a nice hostess seated us and offered us menus to peruse as we waited for our server. After about ten minutes, our waitress acknowledges us (while ringing up another tables check) by speaking over her shoulder that she would be right with us. OK fine...at least she SAW us.  Another ten or so minutes goes by and she asks if she could get us something to drink. We order iced teas and then proceed to offer our order...chicken teriyaki with shrimp/vegetable tempura for both of us. My DH (smart guy that he is) mentioned that we prefer white meat and inquired as to whether or not the chicken is a breast or its less desireable counterpart....DARK meat. She explained that we could get chicken breast but there would be an additional charge..not a problem we answered so off she goes to put in our order.   About five minutes later she comes back to let us know that the manager said they don't have \"white meat\" only \"dark meat\" would that be OK. Um, no...it won't be OK. If it was would we have taken the time to explain that we DON'T DO dark meat?? But we were nice and simply asked to see the menu again so we could select and alternate entree. She grabs a couple menus, slaps them on our table and mubles something about \"I guess I need to let the cooks know to cancel your order.\" Huh? Why the heck would you PLACE the order KNOWING we DON'T want dark meat???? OK, fine...whatever.....  Now mind you it's now been what seems like FOREVER and we STILL don't have our beverages. We are STARVING and getting pretty irratible that we've had to wait to place our order, now they don't HAVE what we ordered and we are about to \"DIE\" of dehydration! (bit of an exaggeration of course) She passed our table a couple of times after we had chosen new items from the menu but everytime we attempted to catch her eye, she wouldn't LOOK at us!  Finally we gave up and walked out....and right down to Margaritaville. (see my review)  I was totally dissapointed that this establishment was SUCH a let down. In reading the reviews on the Tempe location it seems this is the norm...no matter the location. Oh...and as a side note....there is this CRAZY architecture going on in this restaurant... everything is SLANTED. I went into the ladies room to use the facilities and came out feeling as though I had a little too much sake. (Which of course wasn't the case because you have a better chance of winning the lotto then being served a beverage here!) Seriously...you look into the mirror and see the slanted wall behind you, the floor seems like its now slanting too...its almost like you have to have \"sea legs\" to mange! I can only imagine how many people get sick in the restrooms who HAVE been drinking... ;0)   UPDATE 08.01.08: My Brother in Law asked the hubs and I to meet he and his GF for happy hour. We were hesitant because of our previous experience but agreed to give it another chance. I have to say that the service was PHENOMENAL! As soon as we were seated, we were offered drinks and appetizers. The food came out almost as quickly as our orders were taken. WHO can beat $1.95 sake and $3.50 spicy tuna rolls? And although I was dissapointed that they didn't offer the Christy roll, the server did suggest the Alaskan roll....which was so FABULOUS I ordered TWO orders of! Although I wasn't a fan before....this latest experience has changed that. I can only hope my next visit is as wonderful as this one!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing as always.  Service was great There were no delays. Even when sever made a small drink mistake it was quickly corrected.   We will be returning"}
{"text":"Just got back from eating at Kabuki, which I was treated to by a friend.  I ordered the soft shell crab appetizer; I love soft shell crab.  Their soft shell crab tasted like the smell of a wet dog, and I had to force myself to finish it.  I ordered the dragon roll sushi, and it was a tasteless mush.  Oh, it looked cute, done in a little dragon form, but I can't ever remember being that underwhelmed by unagi before.  I ordered the apple tart dessert, and again, it was a tasteless mush.  I could barely tell what I was eating.  I was dining with others, and I tried some of their baked salmon and salmon sushi, and it was all just blah.  I can't ever recall eating sushi and Japanese cuisine that bland before."}
{"text":"I'd probably give a place like this more points if they weren't so damn over priced and had a bit better execution. A fairly small tuna poke appetizer and 2 not that special rolls for over $30 without drinks really?  The poke was ok but not anything like a traditional poke and for some reason they add what seems to be spicy tuna sauce to the tuna first which i don't get and made it a bit too spicy for Sharon H. without mixing it with the rest of the dish. I liked it overall but not as poke which is a very specific taste to me this seemed to lack.   The Sunkissed roll was a good idea but needs better execution. I want avocado and salmon with each bite not on alternating pieces. Oh and premium avocado has good flavor and isn't bland. I did like the special sauce. A little less onion or maybe not raw onion might help too.  The anago tempura roll just misses the mark for me and was over priced for what it was as it was tempura eel with cucumber, mint and fried garlic. at $11 most places have an eel and cucmber roll for $5 and the little slivers of garlic and sprig of mint aren't worth an extra $6. Plus the thing was just too many conflicting flavors and the garlic was over cooked to being so hard it was like biting a piece of rock it actually hurt a bit and didn't feel natural.  To top this all off i just didn't feel the fish quality was up to par. The salmon especially didn't have the normal taste. I will give sushi places a pass when its cheap and not that high quality but when it's expensive and lacking its a problem. The salmon had a fishy taste and didn't have that normal salmon flavor which stood out the most."}
{"text":"Mediocre service, mediocre food, mediocre sake, just mediocre. I guess I was expecting a lot for a chain restaurant in an outdoor mall, but still...I sent back the spicy tuna over crispy rice because the tuna was warm and slimy and just inedible, they did take it off the bill though, which I appreciated. I wish I never ordered the shiitake tofu mushrooms, they weren't even hot and the 'yuzu' sauce tasted like microwaved instant gravy . The meat in the beef teriyaki was juicy and I enjoyed the salad dressing they use, but I don't think I'll be back here ever again."}
{"text":"Yummy - yummy.  This is our go to place whenever our family is craving for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Can't believe it's only 3 1/2 stars.   Favorite dishes: - Salmon Nigiri - Philadelphia roll - Baked mussels - Lotus on Fire - Hamachi Kama"}
{"text":"I've been going here for so many years and I like their lunch specials. I usually get the salmon & vegetable tempura along with Tokyo quesadilla which I love, and their peach tea is good too. The servers are usually very friendly, but it's a hit or miss with their hosts/hostesses."}
{"text":"Not sure how anyone could rate this place below perfection. Came here during happy hour and I became an instant fan! You have to do a lot to please me when it comes to sushi since California has TONS of sushi spots. This place did everything to perfection! And the mojitos!!!!....their regular mojito was the best I've ever had. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping at town square. We decided to stop by kabuki tonight for dinner, me and my family go to the kabuki in summerlin for happy hour often! WE JUST LOVE IT! But tonight is different, we decided to try out dinner this time. When we first walk in, the friendly hostess greeted us, then one hostess told us for a table of two at least a 15 minutes wait,  I think her name was spell \"Giana \"? So we thought they must be busy, after sitting at the bench less then 1 mins, another host has approach to us, and told us that our table was ready, surprise the wait wasn't even long, didn't know why we were told to wait 15 minutes. She lead us to our table, and ask how we were doing, and  if was our first time dining, we told her (her name is Catherin) that we usually go to sunmerlin location for happy hours, and never really order from dinner menu. She then smile and explain their new items on the menu and  recommended few dishes for a sushi lover like me!  Our server Kim was very sweet . She came to us  and got our drink order right away, while we were dining , she will stop by and check our table making sure we got everything we needed! Wonderful service experience I have here compare to summerlin kabuki.  The food was delicious, wasn't expecting they have many options in their menu,  they have those  tasty garlic edamame, and their bbq rib were just delicious !  Defiantly recommend to come here for their sushi, is so fresh and good amount! Worth the price, if you enjoy something spicy, try out their lotus fire roll, if you just like simple sushi, their salmon is the best! Over all the customer service was wonderful and the sushi just great! The only downside is the restroom was a little bit dirty, paper towels all over the floor, and also note to the hostess, if there is no long wait, don't make it sound like there is, if other hostess were able seat me right away, I don't see why the other one say there is a wait, and there was couple tables open. I will defiantly come here and summerlin kabuki for dinner again. I would recommend Kim as server, she just wonderful!"}
{"text":"I had no interest in sushi until I came to this restaurant. The food is excellent, with a big variety of Japanese-style dishes. The Alaskan Roll is my favorite menu item, but most of the menu is equally satisfying. I love their selection of craft beers.  The atmosphere is relaxed and generally quiet, although Saturday nights can be a little noisy. The staff is friendly and attentive. During the week, there is never a wait for a table. On the weekends, waits are generally short.  The regular prices are reasonable, and the happy hour prices are a steal. This is one of my top three favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  If I have one complaint, it's that it is very easy to order more food than we can eat because everything is really good."}
{"text":"Came here with my son and husband on Saturday night, it was our first time dining here. We don't live in the valley and are used to California sushi. In comparison to our experiences here I give Kambuki a 3.5. I found the rolls good sized but not as fresh tasting as I would have liked. I liked the variety of fun rolls and we definitely had our fill.   The ambience was really nice inside, like most things in this area of town the restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. It was dimly lit and nice inside.  A few highlights for me- the white wine I ordered was deliciously cold. I hate getting a warm glass of wine.   Our server, Gina, was perfectly professional and attentive. She really enhanced the experience.  On the flip side, I mentioned the rolls were just so-so, nothing amazing. It doesn't mean we didn't like them, they just didn't blow us away.  The restaurant was at least 80 degrees inside- very uncomfortable. Another reason I was grateful for that cold glass of wine. We asked to dine outside but they quoted us a wait despite it being early in the evening and plenty of open tables on the patio (weird). We should have waited a few mins to sit outside.  We'll probably be back when visiting the area, I wouldn't stay away from here."}
{"text":"This Town Center location is very nicely decorated & the servers & managers are a delight.  As far as food, I had the Brussels Sprouts (happy hour deal) & they are now my #2 favorite BS side in the nation (see Areal Santa Monica for my #1). I had the Tongkatsu pork which was lightly breaded & fried & (just a tad bit on the dry side) but delicious!!!.  My pardner started with the Albacore sushi which was also a HH deal & fantastic & she raved about the Firecracker crisps & balls .....   great experience & a great center to walk around in after eating, too!!!"}
{"text":"The best Chilean sea bass in town. Their sushi rolls are good. I really love their seafood salad. Reasonably priced especially with the LVAC discount"}
{"text":"I agree with most of what Wander Nana B has posted. I, too, have been a repeat offender at this place from the get go. I come her mainly because the rolls are tasty and the prices are more-than-reasonable for fresh sushi. For me, service has been consistently professional, courteous, and genuine. The staff seem to REALLY enjoy working here even though it could get hectic at this busy hot spot."}
{"text":"windows face out to town square so certain tables are great fun people watching"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Except for tonight. I decided to throw one of my dearest friends a birthday dinner here so I showed up an hour early knowing I would most likely have to wait because I wanted to get the table set up with balloons and flowers. I showed up at 4:20. The place was hardly busy for a Saturday. I told them I had a party of 10-15. The host was rude and acted surprised at how many people I said. I waited for an hour and a half watching the hosts seat many, many, many people. I probably watched about 50 people get seated before my party. I finally got seated around 5:45. Meanwhile everyone showed up and we were all standing in the lobby. Balloons and flowers in hand. I understand restaurants do not accept reservations but the fact that they made my gathering feel so inadequate makes me think twice about this place. A party of 15 people, you know we will be spending a nice amount of money so maybe we should be treated a little better. It was just an awful experience. The rolls were crappy and they even mixed up one of my guests food so he had to wait twice as long. I spent a total of almost 4 hours here. Quite disappointed. I showed up when it was empty and eventually got seated when the place was jammed packed. I waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated by the nosy open seating sushi bar that the waiters even have a hard time walking through. All in all next time I have a big party I will go elsewhere. I'll stick to coming here on the weekdays for happy hour since it's slow, and the rolls come out very nice. Hope for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"DEAR KABUKI MANAGER/GM OF TOWN SQUARE!  I arrived at 6:20PM On a Wednesday for Dinner with a RESERVATION FROM OPEN TABLE for your Resturant which states you have a MAXIMUM OF 8 ppl to reserve a table for.  Your hostess then tells me She doesn't have any reservations for Your Restaurant? How is that possible? Is this a Business? Then she proceeds to tell me, you cannot make reservations On open table for more than 6ppl!! What? Then why even be apart of Open table and have 8ppl as a Max??? Then She disappears and comes back apologizes, the she leaves again... She acts frantic and cannot figure out what to do.. People are walking in and no one to greet them! Help your Resturant please... Here for a nice dinner with my in laws and my experience was scary..."}
{"text":"Best spicy tuna in town. Great spot to go for happy hour. Most of the servers are friendly, mainly just one that isn't all that welcoming.  Everyone attends to all customers whether it's their job or not. Good location, near a bunch of good places to shop or catch a movie."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and I have to say this time around I was actually disappointed. The waiter was slammed and could not handle his section so everyone, including us, received poor service. I saw a lady actually walk around the restaurant trying to find someone to give her check and card to in order to pay.  So back to our experience... Two of the items we received were wrong, thankfully a manager fixed one of them and the other was fixed by a completely different waiter. We did not not even receive one of the items we ordered, yet it ended up on our bill. When we pointed it out the waiter laughed it off like it was nothing before we insisted upon him to fix it.   But the event that takes the cake on this one was when I found something in my food. I had ordered the eel and cucumber roll with eel sauce and gotten through 4 of the 6 pieces when I looked down and saw a small thing sticking out of one of the pieces... A bone! Now being a chef myself I know when it is possible to get bones in your food (when you order a bone in steak or pork chop, etc).  Also I understand that there is always the chance of bones in certain fish dishes.   The part that vexed me most was the server's response and reaction when I attempted to point out the bone in my sushi. On a side note, I have NEVER seen a bone in sushi before in my life. He did not look phased what so ever. He stated that with eel it is quite common for this to happen. Then he went on to state that I could actually eat it!!! What the heck?? Is this guy crazy?? He dd not even apologize. I have NEVER had a server tell me to just eat a bone I just found in my food. I could not believe my ears. I will probably still come to eat here because I really enjoy the happy hour and the food. However, I will be on the look out for the dumbest and most insensitive server I've ever met and steer clear on his section..."}
{"text":"The food was great and our server Po was awesome! We had a group of 7 people and tried quite a few menu items. We really liked the Paradise Roll and the Soy Ramen. We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The decor is very modern and clean. Dining space is spacious. Four of us were there for lunch. Lunch price is cheaper than dinner. We spent about 100 total ordering 4 entree and 2 appetizer. Overall, it is a good value at lunch and we enjoy our food."}
{"text":"This is definitely more of the ABC Japanese fare as it is a chain but I have to say that I was pleased with all of the food.  I really enjoyed the garlic edamame which was salty, garlicky, and had some nice red peppers to give it the extra kick.    The sesame chicken was a hit among our  friends.  It was perfectly seasoned and fried.  Unlike most sesame chicken which is tossed in sauce, it's served dry with a dipping sauce.    With a party of 12, we pretty much ordered everything.  From the sashimi combination platters to the koshou beef, soba, unagi rolls, everything was really good.  You're not going to get Monta quality noodles, or Kabuto expertise in regards to sushi, but this place is great for big parties and it's a safe introduction for anyone who's not experienced in eating Japanese.  The food was really good and the location in the Tivoli Village was really nice."}
{"text":"LOVE KABUKI!  Great Happy Hour offers! I also love the option of getting brown rice as well. EXCELLENT SUSHI!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Just wish the taste of the food matched the decor."}
{"text":"Pros: -Brown rice substitute on everything  -Wide variety of menu items -Large selection of speciality rolls -Food portions are generous  -Great decor, chill atmosphere -Children friendly, high chair available -Clean restrooms -Accommodating to our large group  Cons: -Brown rice was a bit hard -Dessert took longer to come out than our actual entrees/rolls -Green tea mochi portion seemed very small  Overall, very good experience. Would come back!"}
{"text":"i went to the soft opening as a yelp event.  i loved it that night and every other night i been.  I brought my bf to try it out and loved it.  we love sushi and now we have a sushi spot nearby.  the kabuki platter is bomb! i'd love to try one of those boat things.  The last times we've been was Happy hour and we order everything off that menu.  and we get stuffed from that! not bad at all!"}
{"text":"We don't really ask for much when we're out at dinner. We like our water to not be empty, our plates cleared in a timely manner, and checked on two or three times by the waiter. That's it. Did our waiter do this? Any of this? No. He took our order and that was about it. We even ordered a Corona with lime, had a few sentences of a conversation about it, checked IDs, and we didn't even get it. No, we didn't remind him. That's not our job, that's his loss of tip. Then our waters ran empty and the server who brought our food came back to refill them without our asking (so appreciative!) and then he comes back after we've been done eating only because it's last call for the kitchen. Really. No. I simply asked for the check. No kidding, 8 minutes later and he brings it to us. Wow. Find another job, dude, waiting is not your calling.   What didn't make the night a complete ruin was the fact that the food came out in a good flow. It wasn't the best sushi we've had, we've enjoyed better, but it satisfied our craving."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place as of now! This used to be my spot years ago and I stopped going because I moved to Peoria and it was a 20 minute drive. I absolutely love the vibe and variety. It's a trendy, loud, and sexy kind of vibe. The location is also perfect because after you grab a bite you can go shop, play games, or watch a movie. Kabuki has unique appetizers and a huge variety of fresh sake. My favorite roll is the dynamite roll. Be careful when ordering this though, they also have a dynamite appetizer that doesn't have the actual california roll in it. The server accidentally brought the appetizer one out, not a problem though when I let her know she kindly brought the correct one. Kabuki also has a points club. For each dollar you spend you get one point. When you get 500 points you receive a $25 credit, pretty neat! If you're looking for some fresh sushi and a cool spot to hang this is your spot. Unsure on if they have a happy hour, will update when I know."}
{"text":"They had a ton of options. The service was great but they brought the food out at different times so some people were eating while others didn't have their food yet. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I'm extremely picky when it comes to fried rice. Tempura and other specific dishes I've eaten my whole life. They were incredible here and I highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Very annoyed with them placed an order for pick and they forgot a few items and there a ways from my house. Another time I went to pick up an order took forever for them to process it and it was not that busy. It seems they only like you dinning there."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! We eat here several times a year and are never disappointed.  Miso soup - Delicious Hawaiin Roll - Amazing Lobster Dynamite - Best in town Snow Crab Salad - Wonderful  Everything we have ordered is fresh, top of the line ingredients...  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a chain, and I initially found it in California and then when I saw it here in Summerlin I knew I was in luck.  They have very good sushi, and although it is not part of the restaurant, my favorite thing about Tivoli Village is that while I am eating scrumptious sushi, the valet will clean my car for me inside and out. Anyways, back to Kabuki.  Always good food here, elegant atmosphere.  I recommend the Hawaiian Roll and the Salmon Skin roll.  Both are great."}
{"text":"So I am a sushi NUT. I LOVE the stuff. I had never been to Kabuki but a friend requested we meet here for a late lunch/early dinner on a late Friday afternoon.  The location is great with tons of parking in Tempe Marketplace. Upon walking in, it has a very modern feel and a very open floor plan. The staff was nice enough upon my entrance and I was walked to my friends table.  It took a minutes for the waitress to come by and take our drink order but she was very pleasant and provided us with a few recommendations as we didn't realize we were there during happy hour. The happy hour menu was definitely big enough and provided an amazing selection. Not to mention the prices were ridiculously inexpensive. We ordered a couple of rolls to get us started (the Philly roll and spicy tuna roll I believe). We split them and we're both impressed with the quality - especially for the price! We then ordered the Baja roll which was AMAZING!!   The only reason for four stars instead of five was due to the fact that once we're done with our food instead of offering to refill our drinks the waitress simply dropped off the check and never came back again. Other than that it was a great experience and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is not one of my regular joints when I go to Town Square, but I was going to see a movie and a friend of mine wanted sushi so we decided to try it out. Now, I should preface this with the fact that I am not a sushi eater... It's just not my thing. But, as a semi-normal human being with taste buds I can still find something on the menu I enjoy. We ended up ordering a bunch of happy hour appetizers (YES! They have happy hour!!!) and a carafe of sangria. Sadly, the only thing that has real impressive flavor was our sangria. Which was actually delicious and I would go back, but only for the sangria.   The food just wasn't anything that wowed me. There was a lot of lacking flavor that I was just expecting and excited for. It's not that the food was bad, it just want that good either. It was okay, and who wants to settle for okay? Not I. If we go to Town Square and want Asian again, we'll probably hit this place up. But, it's isn't the kind of place we'll be dying to go back to and craving."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to Sushi place! Great for dates, celebrations and taking out-of-towners. Walking in, the decor and ambiance is trendy, clean and impressive, yet casual enough where you don't' feel out of place if you're not dressed up. The pretty hostesses are friendly and accommodating- I've yet to experience bad service in all the times I've been there. Depending on the time of day, there could be a long wait, but hey! you're in Tempe Marketplace! If you have to wait, take the vibrating coaster and head outside! Enjoy the fireplace right in front or go shopping right next door! The area is gorgeous !  I suggest snatching the patio tables if it becomes available or squeeze in at the bar if you don't have the patience to wait. The patio seating by the bar is definitely my favorite spot. It's great for people watching and enjoying the Arizona air. For a bonus! if you go on weekends, there's usually a live performer right outside Barns & Noble so you get a show with your meal!   So let's talk FOOD!! Yaaay! They change up their menu now and then to keep things interesting. If you haven't tried the Garlic Edamame, it's a tasty twist to the regular Edamame. My favorite appetizer is the BBQ Beef Ribs. Order a side of rice and you're set! Careful unless you want to fill up. I recommend going there for Happy Hour and/or Reverse Happy Hour (awesome prices!) where my usual Broiled Mussel on a Half Shell is only $5.95! Yumm! The poke tuna is great but I don't remember if we were too impressed by the steamed clams. They have a HUGE selection of Sushi rolls. These are my favs: Paradise, Eel & Avocado, Rainbow, & Sunkissed roll. If you're there with a huge party and super hungry, I suggest ordering their Boat option. Very fun. The only time I remember being disappointed was when I ordered their ramen dish and some of the food we tried came out a bit more salty than we like, but overall, this is really a great place to dine. To end this review- you have to check out their Drink selections!! Cocktails, Spirits, Sake, Wine, Beer.. anything you like! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The sushi is cut  a little thick for my taste.. the cooked food is really good.  Prices are reasonable the staff are so nice!!!#"}
{"text":"The short version: good sushi, decent prices, decent service, decent atmosphere.  Of all of the sushi places in Tempe to visit, this is the best to go to with a group, as we often do. Compared to some other choices (Sushi101=small, cramped, poor quality; RA=dirty, smelly, loud), it seems to be the best in our book.  The service is okay. No one smiling or seemingly excited about their lives, but they keep the beverages coming.  The sushi is good. I admit I'm a roll fan, so take what I say with a grain of salt. The rolls bigger than most and I personally like the rose, the philly, the lotus, the lotus on fire, the dragon, and variations of the california roll (topped with scallops, lobster, deep fried, etc.).   I give them four stars because I frequent here with the work crowd and we like it enough to come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very good happy hour I especially enjoyed the Ramen option nice environment and good service. This is a good place to take family from out of town or even have business meetings/ lunch."}
{"text":"My group of friends met at Kabuki on a slow Wednesday afternoon.  We started our Happy Hour of Power around 4 and we didn't leave until about 8 PM.  Our waiter was attentive at every turn.  And the table was set with delicate delights and strong \"potions.\"  Yes, it was a happy night!"}
{"text":"Kabuki Japanese Restaurant for the WIN!! I haven't been to Kabuki in years! Last time I had a visit was when I lived in LA so I was excited to check out the Las Vegas location. My friend and I were doing some shopping this past weekend and it was getting late and of course shopping kicks up an appetite.   When can you ever go wrong with sushi? Never! I went on yelp to see if I needed a reservation and come to find out it just so happened to be Happy Hour! Score!!! When we walked in it wasn't busy at all. The hostess greeted us right away and when I asked if we needed to sit at the bar for happy hour he said no. I thought this was cool because most places do only honor the happy hour in the bar area. This past Sunday night had great weather so why not check out their patio.  Once we were seated, our waiter came over shortly after. He was pretty awesome and really helpful the entire time. We asked him a few questions about the menu and even some things that we didn't see on the menu that they normally offered in LA which was the crab miso soup! Come to find out he was also from California and knew exactly what we were talking about but also had to relay the bad news that they unfortunately didn't offer that on the menu in Vegas! Bummer but it was okay we found plenty of more great things on the Happy Hour menu. All in all this was a great visit with excellent customer service! Can't wait to make this one of my regular Happy Hour spots in town!"}
{"text":"Never have I been disappointed here.  I like to sit at the sushi bar and watch as the chefs put together some of the prettiest and tastiest sushi I could imagine eating in a desert.    Seriously, pulling off great sushi in the Phoenix area seems like a great challenge... this place does a great job.  They're sometimes one of the only places that have toro in the area as well - a personal favorite.  You should ask though, because it's pretty rare.   Finally the mushroom miso soup is very very tasty and a nice way to kick off a visit.  I also recommend the sake based cocktails."}
{"text":"I went here on a date and ended up with food poisoning that was so bad I was curled up in a ball literally shaking for days.  First let me say my date and I went here and the place was packed and busy but we were lucky enough to get right on in.  The staff was really friendly and the place appeared to be really clean and kind of cool and chic looking too.  We both ordered mixed drinks off the menu, something special to their resturant with a cutie name but instantly we both had to return ours as they were disgusting.  We weren't charged for the drinks thankfully and we ended up going with water.  We ordered food which I have to admit it did taste amazing and my date and I sat in the restaurant talking away for well over an hour until suddenly I had to leave.  That quickly I became nauseated and started throwing up uncontrollably.  I know food poisoning can take hours to days to kick in but I knew it was this place specifically that did it because my date and I were sharing food and we both just happened to end up with food poisoning and neither of us ate at any of the same places except for this one place.  I'm not sure if it was cross contamination from not cleaning a surface in the kitchen well enough, from a workers dirty hands, or what it could have been.  But I do know that neither I nor my date have ever returned here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Kabuki for the second time and found it very consistent.  A little above average, but nothing to be all giddy about.  The poke style sashimi was excellent, while the sushi itself was good, but a bit over priced.  We sat at the sushi bar and depended on a waitress who managed to not remember we were there for most of the meal.  And to top things off, she tried to give me someone else's check.  Also, the Asahi beer was brought to my table in a bottle w/o a glass and it was warm.  So I'll give the food a 4 star for quality, but the service barely a 2 star as it was not good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Japanese  restaurants in town, start by trying out their salads, since they are just right! Their price is also very good, especially during happy hour.  Their combination sushi  & sashimi boats  are awesome. Don't forget to order the chefs roll, since that was my favorite dish.  They have good grade SAKE, so make sure to get those shots going!!! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh and yummy Japanese restaurant at Town Square Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had to go to Marketplace earlier this summer, and decided to have lunch at Kabuki.  He's a big fan of all things Asian...hell, I'm surprised he married me and not the girlfriend he had in Japan.  Maybe she was not such a fan of all things American.  Anyhow, I digress.  So I really don't love sushi all that much, but I have at least come to the point I will eat just a teeny bit of raw fish, but for the most part, I stick with salmon and shellfish.  I ordered a Rose roll and a Dynamite roll.  The Rose roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, and spicy tuna) was tasty, but the nori was really tough and chewy.  I don't recall ever noticing that before with a sushi roll.  But, Kabuki's pieces are so big that I didn't really want to shove the whole thing in my mouth, but that's pretty much what I had to do.  The Dynamite roll (vegetables, crab, and scallops on top of a California roll) was also good for this limited sushi eater, but the spicy mayo sauce or whatever it was over it was overwhelming.  Just way too much of it, and that says a lot since I don't really love sticky rice and prefer a little sauce of some kind.  Half as much would have worked.  We did have good service and might come back if we are already at Marketplace, but it wouldn't be a destination for me.  The restaurant was also very warm inside which made me paranoid about eating fish.  It was fine, but I want any place serving sushi to be an ice box."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Good sushi. I ordered mussels... To die for. Must order this. Soft shell crab was good. The lobster roll was my favorite. Every roll was good. So happy with everything. Service could have been better. Not to attentive with us at the sushi bar. I didn't give it 5 stars because they use imitation \"krab\" in their rolls. Not happy about that."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Their happy hour is great to hit if you are looking for a snack and a few drinks before dinner.  You cannot go wrong with their apple saketini and the sake sangria is fabulous... Good thing you can't order it by the pitcher!  ;)  We started off with the king crab appetizer and a cold beef tenderloin that had a killer spicy ponzu sauce -- awesome presentation and both very impressive!  I am more of a sushi person but my boyfriend likes meat so we usually end up ordering a couple of rolls and the hibachi beef/chicken plate.  Last time I had the lobster roll and it was clean/decadent.  We also had the lotus on fire roll and it was HOT... they do warn you of this though!   The hibachi is great but the way they bring it out is disappointing... traditionally you have appetizers, soup, salad... thennnnn you have the hibachi... the hibachi made it out before the salad about a minute after the soup.  I could look over this one time but it has happened every time that we have ordered the hibachi along with our sushi.    All in all I would recommend this place if you are going for sushi and having a good time in a cool atmosphere!  May want to give waiter a heads up if you order the hibachi though!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Definitely going back to eat sushi here again as I found it to be better than in a few other places in the west valley.  We went on a friday night and it was BUSY, but we did not have a wait because we sat at the sushi bar. Had a few rolls and appetizers - everything tasted great and the service was prompt and friendly.  Only thing I did not like is that the place is not very spacious so if you're seating in an 'aisle' it can feel like you're in a plane with a flight attendant bushing up against you. Another thing I am not a fan of is the size of the specialty rolls- I don't like when they're so fat that it take 2-3 bites and they fall apart in a mess - I prefer 'bite'size' ..  I'd still recommend this place."}
{"text":"I need a disclaimer \"Cheyenne, do NOT drink too much Saki!\" My food is always yummy and the service is always great, so great that I just have to say \"Yes, please\" when I am asked if I want more Saki.  Next time I will go for lunch so I can just enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm so glad I found this place! Honestly it was a little difficult as the GPS dumped me about four blocks away. I called, not once but twice, for directions and the girl at the counter was exceptionally helpful. I happened to arrive during happy hour so my meal was pretty inexpensive. Lucky me! Service was great and the waiter helped me narrow down my food selection. I always appreciate that! Food was amazing and sake was too! I'll be back !"}
{"text":"The menu at this establishment is incredible, the choices are un ending and delightful.  This was my first visit here and by no means will it be my last, actually I can't wait until my next visit (soon)."}
{"text":"Came here with my Ironman meal voucher and asked specifically if I could use it here. Our waitress said \"yes\" we could. At the end of the meal Annie came out and said Kabuki doesn't accept the voucher for our sushi platter. Hassling back and forth became useless and tiresome. Meal was great but the manager was horrible.  ***Note - Do not come here if your doing any Ironman events."}
{"text":"In AZ on Business and this place was on the Hotel Restaurant List. I was a little skeptical of \"mall\" sushi.. but was delighted when the food was served. Everything was full or flavor, staff was attentive and had a great selection.   Definitely worth checking out if your in the area!"}
{"text":"So we came here on a Saturday night at 8ish for dinner before a movie. Hostess told us 20-30 minutes....ended up being over an hour. We wouldn't have waited except there was live music outside and we had a spot near a fireplace. Our server, Dillon, was really nice. Made a point to find out if we were waiting long, even though it wasn't his fault...place was busy. Food is okay... Tempura - standard, poke was pretty good. I think they topped the shishito peppers with bonito flakes, which I didn't like too much. Rolls were ok. I really like spicy tuna rolls, so if a place doesn't get that right, it's all downhill for me. Not likely to go just for kabuki, but if I happen to be at Tempe marketplace, and I want sushi... Guess I don't have a choice"}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is beautiful and the wait staff was spot on but as some previous reviews mentioned, this place will give you some serious sticker shock. You are definitely paying for the atmosphere here. The food, well, it was good but did not blow me away.   One standout however was a roll they call a \"large Roll\" shrimp, avocado, egg & vegetables. It was not a roll I would have ever ordered but my dinner guest thought it sounded good and to my surprise it was and at $4.95 was reasonable."}
{"text":"On a whim, my friend and I went to Kabuki for an early dinner. We were seated right away (by the door) and our server, Ly, promptly took our drink orders before bringing us complimentary edamame.  As a vegan, I appreciated the vegetarian/vegan menu. There were several options for me but I ended up getting inari and a bowl of veggie ramen. Both were awesome.  My friend, not a vegan, ordered sesame chicken and some sort of quesadilla appetizer (???). As far as I know, she enjoyed both dishes.  Again, I'm a vegan so I can't comment on the actual sushi but we had a great meal, excellent service and the prices were very reasonable (yay happy hour!)."}
{"text":"I got the salad with ginger dressing as a starter and it was awesome. I also got the spicy tuna and the Rose roll. They were both ok. The tuna didn't taste all that fresh. The service is pretty good. Hachi at Redrock is much better."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food , I'm from California and in Cali there's so many Kabuki's but here in Vegas there is only one . Well this one is AMAZING ! it's better than all the ones I tried in Cali cause here they are consistent with flavors and amazing customer service . Edwin (server) has been our server many times and he never disappoints he's so kind and always has a happy friendly attitude. He's one of the reasons we keep coming back here , amazing food amazing server what else can you ask for :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time  First tried the takosu salad delicious  Then lobster dynamite so amazing and rich tasting . Had kaladescooe roll so pretty and delicious. Then sashimi they do not skimp on this one  All and all it was really fresh and really delicious did wish my takosu was a bigger portion but can complain at the quality . Our waiter was super attentive and most of the sushi guys were funny and interactive except the one we sat in front of he was no smiles no interaction not at all what I would expect but the guy next to him was funny delightful and a joker loved it will go and go and go . Also the girl in front was super sweet and even let us know before we seated that we could enjoy happy hour all night in the saki bar super cool"}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi place for dinner!   Nicely decorated. You can dress up or down for this restaurant. The atmosphere is welcoming yet professional and chic. I recommend going during Happy Hour Sunday-Thursday. Their portions and quality of sushi are still the same as regular hours but for a cheaper price. Ask for a Sake Sangria. It's delicious!   I've sat at the sushi bar and a dinner table during the 3 times I've gone and I have had excellent service by the servers, manager, and sushi chefs all 3 times. Each were constantly attentive to anything I needed and made sure my plates were cleared promptly. The manager each time approached my table, asked about my experience and if I needed anything.They were quick to address anything I needed. It definitely shows that they care about their clientele. I even joined their free membership program where you can add points for discounts and free meals because I enjoyed the quality of food and service so much.   I've never sat at the bar, but I have seen people there during the late hours. You should definitely check this place out if you're at Town Square. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with I don't eat sushi. I had the teriyaki chicken and my husband had more sushi than he could handle. We both enjoyed it. Nice, clean restaurant with trendy decor and attentive servers. Convenient location for shopping."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour. Drinks are nicely priced and happy hour food menu is pretty good. Normal menu prices are a bit over priced.   The beer tower looks awesome. Want one in my Cubicle. Haha.   Overall I say it's an ok place. If you're in the mall stop by for happy hour. If not I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been coming her for years.  The review is for the last 3 visits.  The Chilean Sea Bass is good as far as Phoenix standards.  It's hard to get high quality fresh seafood in the Valley.  3.5-4 stars. 3 stars compared to fresh fish I can get in Maui (Hawaii).  GO Wild Roll used to be my favorite first 3 times I tried it.  Years later, I just don't feel the same love for it.  3.5 stars.  Maybe freshness has went down.  It's spicy albacore and I love tuna.  Just not as fresh as it used to be.  Lava Roll is 4.5 stars.  Pretty good.  Love the happy hours appetizers such as firecracker (salmon). 5-stars.  Service is usually decent.  Sometimes good.  Get the fresh wasabi (extra charge).  This is the real wasabi not what most people are used to but every girl I shared it with loved it and said it was way better."}
{"text":"I see mixed reviews here so let me say that on some days the sushi is badass awesome and on other days, it sucks.  I come here often during the happy hour for their specials.  I do notice the weekend night sushi is often way better than the happy hour.  I would give it 5 stars if the food was consistently good.  Service is almost always awesome.  Very friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Only tried the spicy tuna roll and a peach Margarita both were very good! Will definitely  be back"}
{"text":"Lived in Japan for 8 years; Kabuki was one of the few Japanese restaurants that came close to the \"real thing\". Good stuff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Town Square. Stopped in for a late lunch. It was still too early for the Happy Hour sushi menu so went with the Sashimi Omakase Special. Probably better since I'm watching my carbs over the next few weeks. Great place for business meetings or to go clothing shopping afterwards."}
{"text":"Kabuki is one of my favorite places because it reminds me of home. I lived walking distance from one in LA and always found myself there. When I first moved to Vegas this one was being built and it just made me so happy. It is a beautiful location. I recommend you join their frequent goer program, you get coupons through out the year to try new things, emails about contests and menu changes, and my personal favorite $15.00 gift card for your birthday you can use any day the month of your bday. I hate when you get coupons for places you can only use on your day, you cant do everything and eat everything in one day! When you get in there grab some garlic edamame. Its awesome and then go to town on those rolls. They are all awesome, there is nothing here I've tried and not liked. As far as the service goes, its nothing to brag about so I recommend you sit directly at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"They have very unique sushi! I loved their udon best I've had in the U.S.  Their lobster sushi is the best lobster sushi I've ever had. They had a King Crab sushi roll that was unique because it was wrapped in cucumber. It wasn't as good as if it was to be wrapped in rice but it was definitely something different."}
{"text":"A new sushi choice that was delicious. Fun, hip vibe and decide with helpful service. We had several specialty roles (lotus on fire & sun kissed) as well as salmon sashimi. It was all very good. While it was a tad pricey, we would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Tasty, Tasty, Tasty and Good Service!   I had never been to Kabuki before but love sushi and food in general!   Sweet Potato Fries Are Awesome!  Salmon Asparagus Rolls Are Outstanding!  Spicy Tuna Rolls are Tasty!  Sushi Bar Staff Is Super Friendly!   All in all this is a great little spot to get your feeding accomplished!   Stop by for a BITE!"}
{"text":"Attended a birthday with family here a couple months ago.  There's no lack in quick service, good food, and artistic interior design for any of these Kabuki Japanese restaurants.  The one in Burbank, CA is also awesome.  Makes a cool place for any other special occasion, or even mothers/fathers day.  Their bar has television for the sports fans.  This restaurant is pleasantly located in Tivoli Village, across the parking structure arches, above ground.  Gotta see this area at night especially.  And during the winter holidays - really pretty.  Craving Japanese food or looking for a meal and somewhere to hangout afterwards, indoors and outdoors?  You got it going on here."}
{"text":"Its a chain that is all that can be said about it. Just like most restaurants in the are service can be hit and miss but get the right one and you'll have a good night. Its over Americanized on the food menu but the masses order the most so I'll just have to stick to china town for some good authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"Tasty food, refreshing drinks, stellar service (shoutout to Jenny!), and sleek atmosphere! Kabuki will definitely be my go-to sit down spot in Town Square.   The menu spans sushi, noodles, traditional Japanese as well as fusion-y appetizers, larger plates, and hot stone BBQ. My boyfriend and I ordered a sampling of most of those items. He's half-Japanese and a raw fish aficionado to boot and I'm, well, not exactly one haha, but we both enjoyed the dragon roll (has unagi drizzled in a yummy sauce and soft-shell crab). *BONUS POINTS FOR BROWN RICE SUBSTITUTION ON THE SUSHI ROLL.* Chicken karaage + another flavorful/mildly spicy sauce and BBQ pork belly hit the carnivorous spot, and the portion size was perfect for sharing between two. The Tokyo quesadilla (mozzarella in a wonton shell topped with pico de gallo) was the fusion-y surprise, and it was a nice palate cleanser between the meat and fish. My sizable goblet of sake sangria was awfully refreshing.  Our waitress, Jenny, was so warm and friendly while offering efficient and attentive service. When we inquired she even asked the kitchen where my boyfriend can procure unagi on his own here in Vegas (we moved from L.A. and he misses the extensive Japanese grocery options of Southern California).  Decor is sleek and music was not overly loud. It was a perfect break from the sound level of our other Friday night activities. They have ample seating space for everything from pairs to larger groups.  Kabuki earns a two-thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We came here on our vacation to Vegas, and I was very impressed with the decor and the ambiance of the restaurant. If I were to own my own japanese restaurant (which I will someday), it would totally look like this place.  I love how they had an assortment of different Japanese cuisine, most places just specialize in either just sushi, ramen, teriyaki, etc. But this place had everything. I can't remember the name of the sushi, but it had lobster in it, it was sooooooo good!!! That was the first time I had seen lobster in sushi and I thought it was amazing!!   Its located in town square so you have plenty of shops restaurants and a theater to go to when you're done. A great date place I might say.   The ramen was good too, but I dont rather lean towards Tonkatsu, but my boyfriend loved it. Great customer service as well. Looks like they employ students from the area.   This is now our favorite sushi spot in Vegas and will make it a point to come here whenever we come back."}
{"text":"If you're a spicy tuna fan... here's my pick 3:  The Spicy Tuna Salad, Sunkissed Roll and Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll.  I know it might be spicy tuna overload - but hey, if you're in spicy tuna mode... why not try my trio? :)  (The location also happens to be conveniently located across from the H&M at Town Square, that's the .5 that pushed it to 4 stars - not exactly food relevant but hey, it's my review)"}
{"text":"Came here for Ironman AZ this weekend. DON'T waste your voucher !!! Had an awful service tonight.  Our utensils and glasses were filthy and had to ask the waiter to replace.  Our sushi didn't come with wasabi and ginger . Requested it THREE times and waited 30 minutes for it ! Complained to the manager and she didn't do anything about it . SAVE your Ironman voucher somewhere else !!!"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE! Looked nice from the outside. There were over 12 empty tables, 2 couples waiting, and still we were told it would be a 25 minute wait. Decided to have a drink at the bar. We were the only 2 people at the bar and it took 5 minutes to get a bartender (as my English friend once put it, \"If i don't have a drink in my hand in 30 seconds, the bar is s**t.\" Finally seated 30 minutes later. Very soggy edemame, clam miso clams were chewy, and the sushi....I'm no sushi expert, but we ordered 3 different rolls and each tasted slightly sour and \"rank\". Even the ginger had a very sour aftertaste. To top off things, we only had water and my glass stayed pretty much empty despite the waitress promising to fill it up right away...three times. And they didn't bother to clear off the dirty drink glasses, something that should be rudimentary considering their drinks are over priced. Overall, poor service, poor food quality....obviously not the only ones thinking so, as the facility was more than half empty, which should have been a clear sign to stay away. DON'T EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"after a disappointing attempt years ago at the tempe location, i was skeptical to eat here again. however, there are only chains in the area, and this was our only option for a fish heavy menu.  we waited about 15 minutes and were seated. the food was very good. we had a sashimi plate and mediterranean sea bass. however, we had to hunt down silverware as it is difficult for us to eat sea bass with chop sticks. the fish was well cooked and came with a tasty salsa on the side. the asparagus was grilled and salted tastily. we also ordered the pickled vegetables but i wasn't impressed with that dish...the veggies were too rubbery.  service was prompt and friendly and our water glasses were filled regularly. i will say i have to agree with my wife on the TV opinion....restaurants should be for eating, not for having TV's. there's nothing that says you don't enjoy your wifes company than taking her out to a place with TV's everywhere (unless it's a sports bar).... \"i'm not interested in your company, so i'll watch the Big Game while we eat\". prices are a little high for their dishes, but oh well...."}
{"text":"A group of ten of us went out to Kabuki while in Las Vegas on Friday evening.  We got a bit lost trying to find the restaurant in the area as we ended up on the wrong side of the shops/restaurants.  We were able to get almost immediate seating, and we had very attentive wait staff.  They brought complimentary edamame as we awaited our main courses to arrive.  While food took a little while to arrive, it makes sense as we ordered A LOT of food.    I was the only non-sushi eater among the group so I was very happy with the teriyaki chicken/BBQ beef ribs combo dinner with salad, rice, and soup.  My friends all ordered sushi dishes (including two HUGE boats for $55 each), sake, and various appetizers.  All in all, we enjoyed our dishes and had no regrets on what we ordered except for how much food we ate.  While the prices are reasonable, there is reason to celebrate as you can sign up for the Red Mask Club for free (https://kabuki-lt.securetree.com/main/1/Home/SplashPage), where you can earn points for all purchases and when you get to 500 points, you get a $25 thank you reward.  You also get a $15 birthday reward each year on the month of your birthday.    Check out my photos for how delicious some of the dishes ordered look including one of the large boats of sushi."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Sunday night and waited not too long to be seated. The server kept the refills coming and the food was delicious. The spicy udon seafood pasta had big clean fresh scallops in it. Sizzling Yakibuta pork appetizer came out last with the main entrees but it was definitely worth it. Manager came by to check on our table. Overall great dinner."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi/Japanese cuisine!  Our server Susana was excellent....very knowledgeable about the menu!  Everything was perfect, as always!"}
{"text":"The sushi is absolutely fantastic. Some of the top choices: smoked philly, vegas and baked dynamite. VERY fresh and full of flavor. Sake bombers were ON POINT. Kirin beer bottles are HUGE and the sake is served hot (I can't stand cold sake).  The service, however, made them lose a star. We really didn't know who our server was because not one particular person checked on us. Granted, the place was slammed and I'm sure they were running around like headless chickens... but still. It's not acceptable when the chefs are more attentive than the wait staff.   I'll be returning but I'll sit at the bar next time."}
{"text":"Shout out to Trevor for the amazing service tonight! He was very personable and attentive to the needs of customers even when the restaurant was clearly busy. His menu recommendations were spot on--you must try their new spicy seafood champon!  We ordered the spicy seafood udon pasta and the spicy seafood champon. The pasta was perfectly cooked and had a good variety of seafood in it! The seafood champon was packed with flavor and was enough to feed me twice!   We had a very positive experience overall, and would definitely recommend this for your next date night!"}
{"text":"Good location for date night and they offer a vegetarian menu. The service was very slow at best but worth it for the food. Ordered the fried tofu rolls which was pretty good, sauce was awesome. Would go back if in the area"}
{"text":"I took a friend here for his birthday. The reviews were good so I figured I'd take him. Annie our server was absolutely delightful. The edamame was fresh. Our rolls were great! Good atmosphere, everyone was nice.  I would definitely recommend this place to people.  I'm glad I came."}
{"text":"I came here for the poke. I was trying to recreate poke bowls from Hawaii because I missed them so much. They serve their poke on a bed of seaweed salad and radish strings. I left the salad behind but the poke was super delicious, well seasoned and fresh. I got a side of rice and asked for happa rice (half brown, half white). My waitress was nice enough to accommodate my request by serving me half white and half brown, not the mixed together rice that I am used to, but the rice was delicious. Second to the quality of the fish, the quality of the cooked rice really makes or breaks a place for me, and this place ad great rice. I got there during happy hour so after my meal I also tried the salmon sushi, which means salmon nigiri, I thought i was getting a sushi roll, but it ended up being two pieces of sake nigiri. I was a little dissappointed in the way the salmon tasted. Salmon is my most favorite fish but this one wasn't terribly fresh. Definitely not as good as the tuna I had in my poke.  I gave them 3 stars because I had pretty bad service. I think my waitress forgot about me. I was sitting at the sushi bar and ordered everything at the same time as soon as I sat down. I got my poke directly from the sushi chef first, then waited 10 minutes for my rice, later got my edamame appetizer and had to remind her that I asked for water too. It all came out of order!  Truly, the service wasn't bad enough to keep me from returning. I'll definitely go back to eat my way through their menu"}
{"text":"The service was great and I appreciated or server Dru. We had a bit of a wait, a little longer than the 25-30 minutes we were told but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of the fancier Japanese restaurants I've been to.  The sushi selection is pretty wide, but most of them consist of california rolls with stuff on top of the rolls (tuna, salmon, scallops, etc)  I ordered the tempura california rolls, and the rolls were pretty huge!  Sushi is pricey, but it was definitely worth it. The service was great, the waitress that seated us always walked by to make sure that we were okay with everything."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Friendly service and very good sushi and prices.  Most of the rolls are basic with a California roll base but venture off the traditional path and talk to the server and you will find very nice and flavorful meals.    The prices are - to me - shockingly low and both times I have walked out full bellied and not an empty wallet.  I have had better sushi but for a stop with family or friends it is a great choice.  I really loved the Albacore Crunch roll and the crispy spicy tuna appetizer was great.  All with a bottle of cold sake."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this stop.  Just walked in.  The crispy rice spicy tuna appetizers were awesome.  Prices are very reasonable.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best aspect of this place is quite simply, sitting outside and Linda the bartender.  She will take such good care of you, you'll want to come back just to be waited on by her. The lychee martini is always a must and the food is always on point. The garlic edamame, sashimi and yellowtail carpaccio are consistent winners."}
{"text":"We were there for Happy Hour & it was a decent way to try out the place.  Not bad.  The fried sesame chicken was tasty.   The saba was delish.   Very marinated & tasty.  The crab roll was ok.  The rice wasn't packed tight enough though.  The Salmon Roller was good, but the salmon wasn't the freshest.    The service was a bit too freakin cheery for me...  I'd try it again another day."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Good service and they had delicious options for people who really were not into sushi. I had the the crunchy spicy tuna roll, which was great. This was a good change up from burgers and beer before catching a game on a Saturday.   However, a friend of mine went the week after me during the week and found it to be nothing special."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me... I normally don't like hipster sushi restaurants but I came here the first time on a recommendation and wasn't disappointed. The food was actually a lot better than I expected.  It's really nice inside, I love the lighting and decor plus the view of the Westgate fountains is kind of cool. As Faith A. mentioned in her review, I expected to pay a lot more than what I did for my dinner + alcohol...that's a plus!  Last year I celebrated my birthday here with a party of 20 people (originally invited 12) which kind of worried me because they don't accept reservations on the weekend, but they had no problem accommodating us when the tables became available. The servers were really cool with our large party and even gave me some birthday drinks on the house! Then after that I couldn't really remember... OH and like everyone says - the bathrooms are cool and disorienting... but not fun after you've had a few sake bombs."}
{"text":"My daughter and love eating at kabuki, always have a great service, and most of all the food is always on point."}
{"text":"Consistently clean, efficient service.  Happy hour rocks.  Tonight we had the baked Salmon roll.. oh my - warm, basically a California roll with salmon baked on top. Like a whole meal right there!   Complimentary edamame hits the spot.  And the exquisite decor makes it a refreshing experience.  My waiter was even happy to put cucumbers in my water as there were no decaffeinated iced tea.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Too bad. I really wanted to try this place because I heard they had a great happy hour.  I understand places get busy but when you don't acknowledge your customers after they've sat down for at least 5-10 minutes, you don't deserve my patronage. The place is not that big so I know the server that was assigned to my table had to have passed me at least a few times.  I waited 5 minutes. Then another 5. Not even a drink order or a napkin down.   Not cool."}
{"text":"Clean & pleasantly decorated Japanese Restaurant in beautiful Tivoli Village. We enjoy their specialty Sushi rolls and their green tea ice cream is wonderful. Sometimes the service gets slow, but the staff is always pleasant. A few of the servers just need to pay more attention to the tables in their section. We always get our order fast, so I don't think it's the Sushi chefs. But getting a refill on tea or ordering additional items can require you to flag down the waitress. It's not enough to stop us from coming, but management can't improve without honest feedback. With more consistently attentive servers, I'd have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner here last night for the first time. Since we had never been there , I asked our waitress what drink she would reccommend. Her response was \"I dont drink alcohol so i dont know\"......I have been working in customer service log enough to know that if her manager heard that he would be pissed. When we asked for reccommendations on rolls she pointed to about ten different rolls going..this is good this is good etc etc...lol. We ended up ordering a lot of food and most od it was delicious. The flavors were great. One roll we had , Ifelt like the fish hada bad smell so I let someone know...he argued with me ...he said well we get it in every day, and we put vinegar on it..then he looks at my husband and says...what about you sir what do you think?! There was no sollution offered or anything. I WAS SERIOUSLY APPAULED. This restaurant definitely needs work on their customer service and showig some respect to customers. Overall the food and atmosphere were nice but the customer service will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but the sushi was great and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"I recently visited kabuki for the first time and had such an awesome experience. Our server was so personable and very knowledgeable of the menu. I am very picky of what type of sushi I like, and he made sure I enjoyed everything. I will fersure be coming back soon. Thank you Paushman for giving such great service."}
{"text":"Been eating here for many years. Thought they were great. Spent some of my military service time in Japan. Love all Japanese food but lately I believe some MBA got involved with their business plan and the quality of the beef went to hell. Spoke to the manager about it. He told me has had many complaints but headquarters changed beef suppliers to cut costs and he was unable to do anything about it. Now the Yakitory is dark meat chicken only. Must be the same MBA. Increasing profits while cutting quality. What a shame. Won't be going back again. Maybe you can increase profits by eliminating the shrimp in the tempura and then the vegetables next. Abunai, Abunai."}
{"text":"Consistently good food! We usually order main entreés..love coming here for super quick service, tasty apps and main courses !!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is our favorite place to eat when we come to Vegas. The Samurai Deluxe is amazing and you get a lot of food for the price with it."}
{"text":"Stopped here to eat last week on the advice of a friend.  We chose to sit at the sushi bar. It was Friday night and very busy.  Got 2 seats at the bar. Decorative place, nice atmosphere and again very busy. It took a abmormal amount of time to get drinks and order. As we were sitting awating our drinks we kept getting bumped and pushed from the servers grabbing sushi plates from the bar. This was extremely frustrating. They should have a server pick up area, not continually reaching over patrons who choose to sit at the bar. Drinks arrrive finally and they bring complimentary edamame. As we sat there we kept getting wiffs of some not so great smelling fish. This was definitely not a good sign.  We ordered tuna appetizer with jalapeños. Flavor was ok but the fish was very fatty and should not have been served imo.  Drinks were out at this point (draft beer served in a 8oz glass doesnt last very long) and again it took forever to flag down a server and forever to get them.  We ordered food directly from sushi chef.  We ordered 3 rolls in total.  All were just ok and all were rushed. You could really tell they didn't put much effort into it.  Sushi rolls fell completely apart before you could eat them.  Meanwhile, bad fish smells still are hitting us every few minutes. Probably won't go back. They should really consider revising the policy for servers picking up food over your head the entire meal. They should also consider more training into rolling the rolls so they are edible and not just a pile of fish and rice on your plate. Overall service needs help, food presentation needs help, food quality needs help.  Beer should be served in 12oz glasses or larger, or at least have the option to choose a larger size which they never gave us."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for about 5+ years. My boyfriend and I usually go and get the usual every time! We usually go during happy hours and we are both Red Mask Club members. They're prices are good for the portions and quality of the food!   We are sushi lovers and used to go get kabuki every 2-3 weeks but it would put a hole in our wallets and we eventually cut it down to going once a month.   We always order the shrimp tempura rolls, tebasaki karage (chicken wings), sometimes the quesadilla, half broiled mussel shells, sometimes Rainbow or Philadelphia roll, and their spicy seafood udon pasta is delicious too!   I love their sushi here and we always get excellent service no matter where we are seated. I will definitely keep returning! Keep up the excellent customer service guys & gals! Now I'm craving sushi again. :)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Japanese restaurant. The prices are great and the food is delicious! I went during lunch and got steak and chicken teriyaki, sushi, soup, salad, tempura, and rice for under $14! I really recommend this place to anyone who likes Japanese food. They have a wide variety of Japanese dishes, including sushi. They also have a good variety of beers and sake. Definitely a must try if you go to the Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"Mostly good quality I been there once and always order on Doordash?but the always forget to give me Wasabi in my sushi or sashimi order. How could I eat with that??And the quantity of the miso soup was aways too little, it is cheap thing in Asia and I don't understand why they are so stingy."}
{"text":"So ok this isn't real Japanese food. The sushi is all Americanized. The tempura is too thick. Atmosphere is nice enough and the beer is cold. The sushi rolls are to big diameter wise after living in Japan for many years and eating sushi often this place is a let down. Should've known better than eat sushi in the desert..."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent!  Had dinner there last night and the service was superior, food was excellent as well.  We come to the marketplace often and the sushi is always beautifully presented and the service is consistent.  Well done, we will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour 3-6pm Monday - Friday !  I ordered the Dynamite roll and it was delicious! I would ask for less topping (sauce and named veggies) because it did get a little messy/soggy. Other from that, thumbs up! I was also given complimentary edamame.. Yum!!!  Place was clean and not too noisy. Perfect spot for lunch after some shopping around Town Square :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good - I loved everything about it and the food was spectacular! I can't wait to come back here but I have one thing that might stop me.... the service, I had a rude server that wasn't listening and just not doing things right, anyway besides that I may come back because of the amazing quality of the food."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant to go to at Westgate. Zane is the greatest bartender ever. I've gone to Kabuki's for the last 4 yrs and the customer service has never changed, always excellent and on point.  Key B's Recommendation: 100% yes, try Kabuki's!"}
{"text":"Now I've never been a huge sushi fan but this place it pretty awesome! I had some drink that was similar to or made with yogurt and it was gone in a second! The decor is really unique and fancy! Just a really cool vibe overall!"}
{"text":"Recommendations:  Apps: Tebasaki karaage (super crunch and flavorful)  Salad: snow crab salad (dressing game on point)  Main: Chirashi sushi bowl (lunch special,  fresh & good variety)  Sushi: albacore crunch roll (garlic sauce is the bombdotcom)   Other notes : Street clear the teriyaki lunch specials. Meats tend to be overcooked and sauce is mehh.   Great atmosphere,  but takes a while for the food to come.   Don't forget to grab those little glitterati candies on the way out. Good stuff :)"}
{"text":"Preferably I like checking out the hole in the wall sushi spots, but Ive been here a number of times for lunch. The hamachi aburi roll  is really good, and the rose roll is pretty good too.  The  summer roll is ok ..like an acquired taste.  Naturally any spicy tuna is good and the spicy tuna on crispy rice is one i have almost everytime I come here."}
{"text":"I am very unhappy with this restaurant because they lie! On their website it clearly shows they have happy from 3-6, and I checked this after I left Kabuki today. Today I actually called and spoke to someone in the phone to ask when they had happy hour specials and the girl on the phone said from 3-6 then they have reverse happy hour at 9. When we got there a little after 3 and asked for their happy hour menu they said oh no not today due to the event. If that was the case they should update their website to say that in case of events they won't be having happy hour and when I called I should have been told this.   I will never return to any kabuki for this very reason this was FALSE advertising."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a better review based on the fact that it looks cool.However, our visit for my brother's birthday left much to be desired.  First, it's no big deal to have to wait. Even on a Thursday night we understand a large party of 5 couples and some kids will have to wait a bit. That didn't bother me but waiting for a table that could comfortably fit 10 with chairs on the corners is kinda sad. The dining room was half empty. There were empty tables all around us and no other large parties. After trying to fit into the table(with one chair short) and realizing our elbows were in each other's sides only sitting there, I asked the host if there was any possible way to add a table. She came over and added one, not sure why they couldn't just do this to begin with but I give them the benefit of the doubt.  The food was good, not the best I've tasted and definitely a bit pricey but the Poke Tuna I got was fresh, it was drowning in a pool of some sort of sauce was strange but helped cut the spicy so I liked it. My husband enjoyed his Ramen, the broth was very good actually. Everyone else seemed to like their meals, despite the fact that the server felt the need to explain everything as if they might change their minds. This also happened when we ordered coffee, it was as if she thought if we knew it was a french press we wouldn't want it. Because of this it did take a very long time for us to get it. When I was brought mine she told me she would have to come back in a minute to press it down for me since it wasn't ready yet. After a few minutes and no sign of her I did it myself and had to tell her when she did come over and apologize that I was familiar with french press coffee and could handle it. The overall dinner service definitely dragged.  The most awkward part of the night came at the end when we were waiting for our checks after explaining we really truly didn't need dessert.(They brought ice cream with a candle for my 26 yr old brother anyway). A large group was seated near us and it seemed they had the same dilemma of too many people for too small of a table. They stood there very near us as a host and server gestured at our table and after a couple minutes walked them back to the front. A few minutes later(while we were still waiting on checks, nothing we could do to try to give up our table and believe me too many of us have worked in the service industry to be table hogs), they were brought back in and shown that the host had set up another table for 6 right next to the original table they were given. More gesturing and stink eyes shot in our direction, then the party went back out front and their original table was expanded to be longer. I'm not sure what the deal is with this place but large parties really shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Especially on a slow Thursday night.   We may try this place again for Happy Hour sushi but this trip just didn't do much for me considering we spend $40 without any sushi or alcoholic drinks. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large party unless you really enjoy sitting on each others laps and having the pace of meal drag because your sole server is obviously overwhelmed not to mention doesn't have much faith in the product."}
{"text":"So far, I've been here twice during Happy Hour and I'm a fan.  Here's a list of my favorite HH items (1st price is regular menu price, 2nd price is HH Price.  Broiled Mussel on Half Shell $6.95/$5.95 Comes with Six Mussels and they are seriously delicious made with a kind of sesame mayo sauce. I can't get enough!  Fire Cracker normally $7.95/$5.95 Spicy Tuna mixed with chopped tomato, served with egg roll chips.  This is great for sharing. Also I don't think it's as hot as it sounds. I like spicy foods but my friend doesn't and she was definitely able to eat this without issue. Sesame Chicken $7.95/$5.95  Lightly fried (tempura) chicken marinated in sesame and ginger. I originally ordered this for my friend as I wasn't sure if she would like the other dishes I chose... but this became one of my favorites after the first bite.   Calamari Rings $8.95/$5.95 This calamari is rings only, lightly battered with tempura.  Tis was ok, personally I didn't love the tempura on this dish. However my friend mentioned that the smaller pieces were better.. Some of the pieces were big and a little much for me. I'd get it again but not my 1st choice.  Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll $7.95/$5.95 Sicy Tuna, avocado and tempura crunch. This one is really good. I really like that it's spicy but not overpowering.  Another favorite roll is the Sun Kissed Roll (but it's not on the HH Menu)  Also, if you like champagne, the plum champagne drink is pretty good. Light and refreshing.   Hostess staff leaves a little something to be desired, but bar staff has been great both times. Very good about refills and making sure I have everything I need.  I'm not sure about the restaurant side, but at the bar they give out complimentary edamame. Because it's free I don't want to complain too much. It comes out cold, which is not my preference, but it also is generally a little soggy. It's definitely not terrible and both times I was there I ate a generous portion. Just doesn't excel as much as the rest of the items I've eaten.  Also, I love that you can order any roll with brown rice."}
{"text":"love the shrimp tempura and their  hot and yummy Teriyaki.They serve large portions and ambiance is great, good for a date or for groups. The restaurant is always clean, might be slow to get the food or be seated but overall it is a regular for my husband and I.  They keep their temp's really cool especially for these hot summer 100 degree days! Mostly busiest  in weekends and evening, great at lunch time. Full bar too!"}
{"text":"Sushi was average.  You can ask for real crab if you want to spend the extra $4, which we did.  Sushi wasn't cut all the way through so we made a mess trying to seperate them.  Drinks were good, service on the patio is a bit slow.  They will forget about you at times so if you're thirsty order two drinks instead of one."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from Ly. So friendly and polite. The food was absolutely amazing and very well prepared. This was my first time here and I have to say it's already a new favorite. Definitely go during happy hour because they are great deals!"}
{"text":"The food is great! I eat here frequently for take out and I am always very Pleased with my meal. The issue is the hosts. They are often rude and disrespectful and as a paying customer, I don't appreciate them giving me attitude. Every single time I come here, the hosts are just plain awful. Make me want to choose a different establishment."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - A Taste of Honey - Sukiyaki)  It's all because of you, I'm feeling good and full I went away, now I'm back for another day  And I love your rolls, how much you'll never know I'm back again and ordered noodles Untouchable memories, order some edamame Of taste so true  That it once turned my palates askew And my food disappeared Now my glass is filled with beer And I'm wishing you were here with me  Okay, Kabuki deserves my love!  This place has been here as long as I've been in PHX. At first it was a cliche restaurant, but now it's fast becoming a staple of Temple Marketplace.  I come here often usually for drinks for Happy Hour and Reverse. Sake bombs and saketini's just keep them flowing. The food has gotten a lot better as the years have passed. Not much of a sushi guy I always say so I order their noodle dishes. Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Mori Soba, and my favorite Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta. The Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura for me is just a filler. The Mori Soba is definitely a summer dish for me since it's cold buckwheat noodles in a soy dipping sauce. The udon noodles is perfect -- from shrimp, mussels, and scallops with what I believe is mixed in some XO sauce -- an Asian spicy sauce. Definitely will kick some behind if you like it spicy.  Overall, the food is good and the drinks are a must in my book. Service is always on top of their game and never fails. Needless to say, Kabuki you lost me once, but now I'm back! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just weird, but I like good sushi.  This place is okay...but seriously, it's overpriced compared to other places where you can have GOOD QUALITY sushi in Las Vegas/Henderson.  I think they jacked up the prices because it's in Town Square.  Town Square my ass, I mean it's only Old Navy a few doors down...not Tiffany's.  Oh but Yogurtland is next door, so you can treat yourself to that and make yourself feel better for paying for overpriced fish."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the service and staff everyone is so friendly and attentive! I had a wonderful night all thanks to kabuki, there delicious food and staff !! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner the other night and it was a great experience. Our server Jenna was very courteous and knowledgeable about the menu. She suggested the ramen and it was delicious! We have to try the lobster roll next time per her suggestion. Overall great food and service!! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time at kabuki Westgate, pricing is good for both happy hours 3-6 and reverse happy hour 9-close Monday through Thursday and Sundays 8-close. Good prices, fiancé and I had about 5 rolls, appetizer and sangria came out to $35 not bad at all ;) def going back probably today"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best places to get sushi in Tempe. Unfortunately Tempe doesn't have as many options as Scottsdale does. I would definitely head to Old Town Scottsdale or North Scottsdale where I think the sushi is better for the price. Kabuki is pretty expensive, but I would guess it has to be based on it's prime location at Tempe Marketplace. The service is great and the selection of food outside of sushi is large as well. They definitely cater to a variety of tastes so if you aren't in the mood for sushi you can still find great food to satisfy you. If you're in the area or shopping at Tempe Marketplace I highly recommend Kabuki."}
{"text":"My experience of this branch was really bad. I order spicy seafood udon pasta and omakase deluxe. The service was great, but the food...... Udon was not well cooked. Seasonning was not mixed with the food. I felt like i was eating plain udon with dipping sauce.....  I still recommend this restaurant, but soom food needs to be improved!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant a few years back and I will forever be a loyal costumer. Great service family friendly and we have gone there so often we have made friends with the staff. The sushi is the best I have ever had no other Sushi establishment beats the Kabuki. Everyone that likes sushi I point them to this place! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the waiter was awesome and the yakisoba was the bomb. The one roll I ordered was excellent too. Wish this wasn't so far from home."}
{"text":"I come here a lot during happy hour just cause my bill comes out fairly cheap. The food isn't something to rave about, but it's good for the price. The service is always impeccable and they are always friendly with a smile. Hence the 4 stars. But the food is more like 2.5-3 stars.   I ordered the spicy tuna, California roll, Philadelphia roll, dynamite roll, and salmon sushi. It's not too hard to make the basic rolls, so it's OK. The salmon sushi is a hit or miss. Sometimes it taste fresh, sometimes not, but it's 2.95. :)   I also ordered the chicken saboro bowl (seasoned ground chicken, egg, green onions, ginger, with rice). It's a big bowl for a decent price, so it's pretty good.   Overall, the food isn't to die for, but it isn't crappy either. I like this place and they have a rewards card, so make sure you sign up for one!! Points = free food!!"}
{"text":"One of the restaurants I wish to own. Clean, modern but traditonal. servers are alwaysright on. Happy hour is quickly served even if they're packed. ORDER THE SALMON SKIN ROLLS for HH. They're the bomb!"}
{"text":"I've heard about Kabuki for quite some time now, but just never took it upon myself to actually give it a try until earlier today. I went in with a party of 8, including myself. It's Labor Day and the wait wasn't too bad, 5 minutes tops actually. It gets even better, it was HAPPY HOUR! Yasssssssssss!  We grabbed a bunch of appetizers to snack on: broiled mussels, shrimp and vegetable tempura, tebasaki chicken wings, salmon nigiri, steamed dumplings, edamame, and calamari rings! None of them were a disappointment, rather delicious!  Also, our waiter Andrew was awesome! He was steady, kept checking on us, filled our waters on multiple occasions, and did not mess up any of our orders! Yay for Andrew!  For our main dishes, I ordered the G.O. Wild Sushi Roll which was really amazing nonetheless! With a hint of jalapeño, it gave the roll a nice little kick. Absolutely loved it! My boyfriend orders the BBQ shirt ribs with shrimp /vegetable tempura, salad, and some other stuff I totally forgot about, but he enjoyed his meal too! I didn't pay much attention as to what anyone else ordered because I was too much into my roll and my 5 month old son!  Anyways, I don't understand why there aren't much satisfied reviews of this place. It was a nice experience overall."}
{"text":"My server was very friendly and took all of our orders on time. We had the lunch special which is from 11am-4pm daily. Food was at best mediocre but nothing spectacular or makes this sushi restaurant outstanding.  Great for service and environment Average for actual food quality"}
{"text":"Came to this location for lunch on Thursday with my girlfriend and my server was Tim. He was extremely attentive and took my orders shortly after we seated. The food was amazing and affordable.   The staff in general were all very polite and helpful. Our water glass were full throughout our whole meal, we are very appreciative of that.   Easily my favorite kabuki location here so far, will most definitely come back again."}
{"text":"First of all. Kabuki is a great restaurant. Known for fresh sushi (which I had). Their overall menu is so underrated. Fried rice? Such a simple dish. Not here. It's phenomenal. House made drinks are thought out and amazing. My server Jaime went above and beyond. With such a diverse menu he was able to answer every question our table had with patience. Ordering sushi is a process. He just just happily answered every question and help some people order sushi who've never had it. I'll def be back for the food. But I'll always ask for Jaime."}
{"text":"After Wrestlemania 26 at the University of Phoenix Stadium, we were headed back to our car when we received a voucher for 20 dollars if we came up and got something to eat, and we wouldn't have to pay for parking.  How could we pass up the opportunity for free parking and 20 dollars in sushi.  The Sushi was awesome, and I was so happy I didn't have to pay to park & got 20 dollars in free sushi, I thought there is only one thing that can make this evening better.  An ice cold Sapporo beer and some calamari.  What a great way to end my birthday weekend in Phoenix, AZ! One last note folks, If you have had a couple beers before you use the restroom, don't freak out, the bathroom is slanted."}
{"text":"Excellent food but service was slow.  Sushi is good, no craft beer.  Martini made well.  Very pricey, but location it's the reason."}
{"text":"The food is good but lacked the finesse that usually comes with high quality Japanese dishes.  I came here only for a hard to find dish called Sukiyaki. I called and asked if it was cooked or brought out in the traditional hotpot so I can cook it it tableside.  The person that answered said.. Yes. It's cooked tableside.  When I arrived. .I was told it only comes pre cooked, not at tableside.  The dish I ate was yummy  But it Definitely wasn't Sukiyaki.  It was a good beef soup.  90% beef 10% onions and table mushrooms.    Regular Sukiyaki comes 50/50 with Japanese veggies and beef.    Very disappointed   So I Tried The cucumber wrapped king crab.  The slices of cucumber were so thick.....Instead of thin..that I almost choked on it.  What a let down  But the only thing that was exceptional. Was the coconut infused sake at 21 a bottle.  Very expensive but very tasty!  I also loved the  Shishito pepper appetizer.  Very yummy with Bonito fish flakes, garlic and teriyaki style sauce  American Japanese with a corporate taste and no passion for their food.  But I'm sure the wide variety of  sushi is probably the only thing I would ever order if I come back for."}
{"text":"Had a great meal, our server Hong was fantastic. She did a great job with serving us and giving us some tips on what to do on this 4th of July."}
{"text":"A new Kabuki Restaurant in the New Town Square Mall.     I think it's run by Koreans but we should of waited until 8pm because it was happy hour.  Buy one dish and get the second dish for $1.   The sushi rolls were decent but slightly big.   We sat by the sushi bar but there was no sushi boat.   Modern, hip decor."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Kabuki on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I met a friend there after going to see the early showing of Avatar, which by the way was fabulous but that is for another review.  They had a special menu for game day inwhich anything that was on this list, you buy one and you get the next item for $1. Not too shabby considering it was about 12:30 or so on a Sunday and its hard to find a happy hour that early on a Sunday (do they even exist?)  Our waiter Ryan was very patient and he backed me up when I was trying to explain to my friend some of the \"safe rolls\" as he is still a sushi novice. (Poor thing doesn't realize what he is missing)  We ordered Kirin, Philly Roll, Lotus Roll (which was topped with lobster yummy) Cucumber roll, Salmon roll, Unagi, Sweet Shrimp, Baked Scallop Roll - whew. (Hey this is from the girl who goes to all you can eat sushi, what did you expect?) I think my friend got a nice easy intro into sushi. I mean he eats it from time to time, but I need to get home onto bigger and better things.  At any rate, the sushi was very good. The lotus roll, the baked scallop roll, and my unagi were of course my favorites. I love my unagi! I tried to get my friend to try it and he did try an ity bity bit. He said it was ok but I am not too sure. He did eat the shrimp which was pretty impressive but trying to see him get the tail off was pretty funny. However he did it in a very dignified way so kudos for him. Needless to say I stuffed myself as usual but its Sushi!!! I love sushi. Enough said.  It was a very cute restaurant and not crowded, but then again it was a Sunday afternooon and I am not sure people know about their game day special. Again kudos to Ryan for the excellent service he provided.  I will definitely have to try Kabuki again if I am ever on that side of town. All in all it was a very good Sunday afternoon with a great friend."}
{"text":"Food is good, love the sushi. But it is expensive since it's located at town square mall. But overall amazing sushi."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try a few days ago while I was visiting. I'm so glad I did, the food was great! I sat at the sushi bar and felt the service was amazing and very friendly.  I definitely will come back when Im in town and visit the woodland hills location.  Recommend the Kabuki Roll and Lobster Roll. Very fresh good portions. Also.I had the halibut and jumbo scallop. So fresh!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in tivoli's . they have great appetizers and delicious sushi the sushi is always fresh for me if you like a little bit of spicy peppers I would try there shishito Peppers they're delicious not too sweet. they have great Korean short ribs which are delicious. Even though the volleyball is rather dead most of the time I still make my way over here the service is pretty quick also and they have delicious hot sake"}
{"text":"The host (kalee) was very kind and polite. I will definitely be coming back for the terrific service I received."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  Service is efficient and friendly ..Huy has been promoted to a managerial position so congrats!  Connor was our waiter and very kind / calm during a busy happy hour!  My favorite is spicy miso ramen soup.  The dynamite roll is delicious and spicy inside out tuna also..  Happy hour from 3-6 pm which lowers the prices on food and drink!  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"A little late getting to this review, but it's good enough they deserve it.  It's really hard to find decent sushi in the Phoenix area, but I was really impressed.  I ordered the sushi moriawase and it was all great, though I didn't eat the egg or asparagus.  That's not a knock on Kubuki, I simply don't like egg sushi and can't stand asparagus so I gave them to my niece.  The only legitimate knock I can give them is the miso soup was only ok, I'm used to having tofu cubes in my miso soup and was disappointed I didn't get any.  But overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Only had a spider roll but it was very good. I'm failing to understand however why there is a need here to add imitation crab salad w mayo in everything. Requested they leave it out. My friends each had full mains which all looked decent. The wine selection was a bit funky and we had a hard time finding anything that hit the spot. Place was all but empty @ 7pm on a Tues night but maybe that's how Tivoli rolls mid week."}
{"text":"Kabuki is my favorite sushi restaurant. The restaurant is nice, clean and lively. Happy hour is very reasonable to go for the rolls and drink specials, although regular menu prices aren't overpriced. I love getting their Dynamite roll and their Philly roll. I've even taken friends here that don't like sushi and they are able to find something to eat here. The chicken teriyaki is also delicious for those who don't enjoy sushi.  I would definitely recommend for sushi and an overall nice meal. I live very close to this place and love their sushi so I will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"We went in for a late lunch. The decor, music volume, and lighting make this place comfortable to eat by yourself, a business meeting, or with a group of people.  It's relaxing, yet a bit lively.  Atmosphere to me, is as important as the quality of food.  And I have nothing negative to say about either one.  Place is clean, and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Always go here for sushi cravings. They have a wide range of great tasting sushi.   They also have lots of main entrees to enjoy from ramen to rice dishes. Can never go wrong with the salmon teriyaki.   The service here has always been superb, no complaints.   J out."}
{"text":"Since it was my birthday and Kabuki uploaded $15 r/t Red Mask Club card, Kuya agreed to celebrate at the Tivoli establishment.  Unfortunately, our experience seemed like training the new staff was not a priority.  For instance, since they offered to take our trays, but no refills on our waters, Kuya decided to serve himself.  Thus, we highly recommend strategic management plans of action to re-assess and re-evaluate staffing and training especially for your new employees.  In conclusion, we would like to prevent others from experiencing the same issues."}
{"text":"The happy hour was awesome and so was the sushi. Appetizers were great. Bartender Liam was a cool guy and really good at his job. With that being said. The bar area also served as an employee lounge. So unprofessional. Employees laying down on the booths. Counting tips. From the kitchen staff to the waiters all eating and taking there breaks all in the bar area. Needless to say it was unprofessional and just a sight you don't want during your happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to try chain restaurants but this was a great choice. Beautiful presentation, very quick at lunch. I ordered the Vegas Roll...when in Vegas, right?!"}
{"text":"Ok it's not every day that some one writes a review about a bathroom but I just have to tell you that if your at West Gate and need to relieve your self stop by Kabuki. It's brings a whole new dimension to the bathroom experience. :)   The sushi is good too.....   My wife an I hit up Kabuki every couple of weeks for there happy hour specials. the prices are great and the sushi is fresh. We are fans.   We are the type that when going out for sushi it's not unusual for us to drop $90.00 for the two of us to dine on some yummy fish, shrimp, and crab but with Kabuki's happy hour we can get out under $50.00.   It's a good deal and allows us to get our sushi fix on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Apparently this is a chain restaurant but given my expectations...  Staff were exceptionally friendly - the hostess, Bobby at the sushi bar, and my waiter.  Free sample of cold soup (don't know the name) and free edamame at the sushi bar was a nice surprise.  Sushi rolls were big, delicious and well presented.  A nice \"reverse happy hour\" at night made many items cheaper.  Waiter was very attentive and brought me new water every time I was finishing my current glass.  On the menu, most items had bright pictures so there would be no ambiguity about what you were ordering.  And they had a sake bar (which I'll have to check out another time).  I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Cute place. However wasn't terribly excited over their sushi. It was rather bland for the most part and just, ok."}
{"text":"So, I've visited both the Tivoli Village & Town Square locations and both of them receive the 2 star review.  Maybe I'm spoiled after living in SF for 10 years and having some great sushi. Or maybe this place just doesn't get it. One of the more important components of a roll is the rice. It has to be perfectly sticky & be consistent in the \"hold the roll\" department. Both locations failed miserably at the rice. It's the basic component if this meal! The rice was either brittle, dry & fell apart or it was cold, rubbery & BLEH!  Once the rice thing fell apart, it was pretty much downhill from there with flavoring & consistency. However, service at both locations was good and pleasant, our Town Square experience with Ana was great!"}
{"text":"So after months of being on hiatus from Yelp, I was absolutely intent on warning my fellow Yelpers.  I visit Town Square on a regular basis, and eagerly awaited for the grand opening of Kabuki.  My fiance and I went during happy hour and ordered their fried calamari, shrimp tempura roll, and gold rush roll.  After one bite of one of the rolls, my fiance immediately knew the sushi was no good.  I took a bite, and although it didn't taste good, I never waste sushi.  So I ate both rolls against my better judgement.  Let's just say, I had to call in sick to work the next day because of digestive problems.  I am not surprised at all that another Yelper had a similar experience!  Because of my bad experience at Kabuki, this avid sushi lover has to stay away from all things sushi related for a little while."}
{"text":"Kocilit was a magnificent server and her beauty made all the wonderful food taste magnificent!! I highly recommend both the food and the amazing and Kocilit for both her depth of knowledge of the menu, as well as how easy she is on the eyes. btw, do try the unfiltered Nigori sake, served on ice. Also, try the Kabuki roll   Great food! Great service!  Four stars for the food. Five, for the service."}
{"text":"First visit. Thursday at 6pm. Not busy and sat at bar. 8 others there and it took over 10 minutes to order drinks. Bartender actually cleaned after a couple just left. My opinion take care of current customers then clean up. No one waiting for those spots   Wife and i had 3 appetizers and the food was great. After bartender realized she screwed up she recovered nicely and from then on all was good. Had  a sampler plate with sushi, tempura veges and shrimp. A great wood cooked piece of salmon that was perfect. Vodka martini was perfect.  Will definitely return and next time we will sit in the BBQ area. Group table with chef cooking and a show. Like Benihana.  And way too many options for s beginner sushi fan but again a definite  goos time"}
{"text":"The pros: excellent location,  great ambience,  a variety of seating,  diverse menu,  reasonable prices, awesome happy hour  The cons: not the best service in bar area, so sit in restaurant section  Came here with a colleague to catch up on life.  We got: Philly roll and Vegas roll, both really good,  Vegas roll was one of the best ever.  Mozzarella tempura: like a jalapeño popper but way better. Sesame chicken: cut small,  crispy, delicious but maybe was over cooked. Tokyo mojito: get cucumber version. Food and drinks were yummy.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Wow talk about your overpriced sushi joint. I understand Kabuki is inside a mall specifically designed for rich old people (Bayview Village) but seriously, I almost take offence at the level off rip-offing-ness that's happening here and almost more so when I'm forced to pay for the standard tea (yes it's an extra $1 / cup)!   But first let me take a breather and tell you about the place. The place looks like it could've been upscale back in the 80's but is seriously flawed in it's decor. The lights, colour stained glass, wierd metal object and thick black leather cushioned chairs just make this place tacky! Not to mention they then have soy sauce in plastic containers you can buy at the dollar store.  Once you're over the tackiness of the place you take a look at the menu, only to realize that their bento boxes are almost $30!!! And they don't even serve all the sides you'd get at downtown sushi joints for $10! Okay so bento is a no go, what about some good rolls? Dragon roll (shrimp tempura, mayo and cucumber) is $9.50 - okay kind of expensive but not too bad -  but hey about a small slice of salmon on top of the rolls (as in the pictures)? $15.50!!?!?!? How are they charging $6 extra for this?  Ugh, this place just made me frustrated. Have a look at the picture I uploaded, everything on that plate cost me $30... yeah I know, shame on me. The only reason I gave this play the second star was that the \"scorpion roll\" as they called it actually didn't taste too bad."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find because it's in the far back of town center and the signage wasn't as good. Once we got in there, were we seated quickly, and served our drinks just as fast. I over ordered (again). I got the poke bowl with tuna and the agadashi tofu. It was all really good and decently priced. It was a relaxing atmosphere and a great place to have a conversation with my friends."}
{"text":"Great sushi place to have at Town Square! It's a bit pricey so I usually just come here for a couple nigiris when I need a little food before I continue shopping or walkin around at TS! The sushi is pretty good! The service is also fast and the staff is very nice/welcoming :) they have yummy side dishes like sweet potato fries which got me! Definitely great for a quick snack. They're not AYCE so don't expect that! I put one less star because i wouldn't go all the way to this sushi place if I ever craved it. It's not like WOWWW sushi but it's pretty good and consistent still! Great for being in the area incase you crave sushi while at Town Square!"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor from the opening of this restaurant, found it disturbing when we were denied a booth for two for the first time-thank you  Bruno.   Change in menu.  And they didn't even have steak knives."}
{"text":"Just one word: awesome! The food is delicious, the staff very kind and knowledge about coeliac disease. They have a very great gluten-free menu. I really like this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one...   I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.    I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.    \"There are two tables before you,\" I was told.  \"It will likely be another ten minutes or so.\"   At that, I responded, \"is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?\"  And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:  -While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!  -Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?  -The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.  -To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.  With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night to have dinner with our friends who are locals. We took an uber but it seems like parking can be hard when its busy. The restaurant is very big. We waited about 20 minutes around 740pm. We were given a booth which can fit up to 6 people except that the booths are not made for bigger people. We ordered a bunch of food and also drinks. We mostly ordered sushi items which were all very good. I think our favorite was the grilled shrimp roll. We ordered another one of those at the end. The service was on point. Our teas were refilled and she checked on us enough. The menu is very nice and easy to read with a lot of photos. They offer an extensive selection, appetizers, rolls, sashimi, soup noodles, etc. I can see why this place is popular.   A good place to meet up with some friends. We were here for about 2.5 hours, basically until closing. It wasn't too loud."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are very good but service organization is a little slow. I like to go there since the taste of sushis and especially tuna and salmon sashimis are highly satisfied. In addition their red musk club provide good score as long as you eat there."}
{"text":"It's sad that Whole Foods can make better sushi than this place :/ skip the crowd and treat yourself to sushi from the lovely chefs and Whole Foods that give you evenly proportioned rolls. Honestly, that's all I ask for? I'm not paying for rice rolls. This place is average at best."}
{"text":"Tastey and bountiful lunch. Gluten free selections. Sake samplers. Convenient location in Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"I like the variety of the menu. had a good waiter Steve. nice patio area.  they give you complimentary edame but it was cold.  better if served warm.  the salad was good. I liked the dressing.  I ordered the chirashi.  the sashimi pieces were small. disappointing."}
{"text":"I'd like to consider myself a sushi aficionado and I have to tell you that this is my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. Everytime we are seated, several staff greet us ... loudly. They must be saying 'welcome' in Japaneese. They have an extensive & very creative sushi roll list. And best of all, upon request, they will make your rolls with brown rice or wrapped in cucumber in lieu of seaweed. The atmosphere is trendy, the staff is always friendly. and it's located in Town Square, which I love. Sadly, the service is consistently mediocre, but it's a price I'm willing to pay for great sushi!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Kabuki yet!  This is one of my favorite happy hour spots.  They would get five stars if it ended at 7 instead of 6.  I've also had dinner here and take out.  Service is always friendly and attentive.  Some of my favorites are the Tebaski Karaage, Goldrush, Vegas and Aladdin rolls, tempura ice cream.  For drinks the Tokyo Mojito and the Sake Sangria.  Another plus is that happy hour is available anywhere in the restaurant.  I really haven't had anything here I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Loved our experience here! We had a group of 7 and they were able to seat us right away.   Our server was very helpful in answering our questions as to what items were vegan, and dealing with separate checks for the group.   There was a good amount of vegan options for me and the husband and plenty for our meat eating friends. So it was a perfect choice.   Personally I had the tofu rolls which were on point! And the tofu steak with a really good sauce, it also came with great steamed veggies. We also got a rainbow veggie roll... And while it was a little on the spicy side... The husband loved it. Also had a gimlet that was perfect."}
{"text":"It's really hard to say bad to the sushi here, everything is so awesome, food, service,perfect?"}
{"text":"Awsome place to come to after work.  Colorful & appealing presentation.  Food is fantastic.  Great place to hang out.  Happy Hour has great prices."}
{"text":"The first time I had Kabuki was in Las Vegas and it changed the way I viewed sushi. Their rice even tastes better, it may sound crazy but you just have to try it for yourself and you'll understand that this restaurant does sushi right. I highly recommend anything with the dynamite sauce or the dynamite appetizer as well as the lotus roll and Mexican roll, all are top notch. Their sashimi bypasses all the rest. If you've saved room for dessert give their green tea ice cream a try as well."}
{"text":"I always come here with my mom for happy hour. The prices are good so it's worth it and the food is consistently good. Not a big fan of coming here outside of happy hour though."}
{"text":"Came here with a gift card with my hubby, but did not feel very welcomed, nor \"treated,\" if you know what I mean.  Food was okay.  I think this is a spot for tourists, not locals.  Some people are not used to Japanese food, plus they're happy--they're on vacation! But for serious Japanese food, so many options off the beaten track are available to you if you live here (or have a car and an adventurous spirit, o ye tourist).  The prices are super expensive, too.  It was a one-off for us, for sure.  I do think if it weren't for the influx of one-timers (visiting Town Square), this place would go the way of their other location in Summerlin, which went the way of the Samurais a while ago.  See \"Philip T's\" review (2009), and you'll get it."}
{"text":"Wine tasting-Good menu-Great location-    I gotta say...   Im a fan.    Prices are what one would expect for the area and quality...    if not a surprising value.   I had the Beef Yaki...    Really sooo good.    I know I should try something else next time I go(and there will be a next time) but it was so good that just writing this makes me want to go back for more."}
{"text":"Good location in town square, especially during summer for happy hour. Good food, good service. Grilled calmari is good, solid sushi. Good spot...romantic at night!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times- they have a gluten free menu as well. Tonight as I ordered the sweet potato fries off the gluten free menu, the waiter was hesitant about it actually being gluten free. So he went to the kitchen and they are fried in the same oil as non gluten free items.  Why have a gluten free menu if the items aren't actually gluten free?  Bernard is a great waiter."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for about two years. Kabuki is always spot on with their food. However, service is quite spotty. Our waitress was slow to refill drink orders. She also forgot two rolls we had ordered and a drink. When we were finishing our meal, our waitress brought out one of the rolls she forgot about. At this point, we were pretty disappointed and decided to take the sushi to go. I will look for a better place with a higher quality of service next time I go out to lunch."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way to the airport and it was pretty lame!  It was HH without a bartender - WTF? Our server was slow as a snail and got yelled at by the manager.  Also, he forgot our drinks.  And our sushi sat at the bar foreeevvverrrr before he picked it up.  Our rolls had too much sauce on it and weren't cut all the way through.  UGH."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat in westgate. Been here numerous times now and this place is pretty consistent. Super clean atmosphere, friendly staff, awesome menu. Happy hour is from 3-6 for both beverages and common sushi rolls. Been here at night and during the day and this is the perfect place to get away from the heat and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"I like their traditional and not so traditional japanese menu. Some of their sushi creations are wonderful. Their portions are very reasonably sized! Their desserts aren't bad either! If ever at Town Square Shopping Center.. Stop by here!"}
{"text":"Okay so at this Kabuki location (I don't know about other locations) - There's no more complimentary edamame. Their menu has changed where some of the food aren't available and the prices are higher. The staffs were always helpful and nice. I don't know if I'll come back to this location but it was the only Kabuki closest to my house but I guess it's worth the drive to go to the other one in town square. The one in town square was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for happy hour since my husband and I are rarely available for HH and it was his bday. We didn't want anything fancy just a casual family celebration. Luckily we agreed he wouldn't be disappointed if it wasn't great being it was his bday. We typically frequent sushi Loca in DTS which has been great (after having our share of ACE sushi and appreciating quality over quantity these days) but we wanted to try a new sushi place.  We ordered from HH menu since it was available and the first round of crunch asparagus salmon was decent. We continued with 2 rolls of Alaskan and a crispy rice with tuna. We got our complimentary edamame after the first roll was already served but no big deal. And my husband ordered Sapporo but server convinced him to go with asahi on special. Although, after reviewing the receipt the Sapporo was actually cheaper on happy hour. So why convince him to get asahi  when HH of his choice was cheaper?? I hate when servers don't know the best deal or how to make customers happy. Anyway Alaskan rolls completely different than what we are used to. It was baked! We like fresh, raw sushi so this was a complete disappointment and  when I questioned  the salmon being cooked she said \"yes baked\" And didn't even ask if we would have preferred something else. She kind of got away real fast after seeing my disappointment. My 7 year old was so disappointed she took off the salmon  and said \"on a scale of 1-10 I give this a zero\" I wouldn't have gone that low as I found it tasty but I don't go to sushi places  for baked salmon. It was greasy and a piece  fell on my husband's new designer  jacket which is now stained with oils spots - no fault of theirs but for that, he won't be back. The crispy rice with tuna can not Compare to sushi loca! Lesson learned, you pay for what you get. Service was just ok. Nothing special. And the atmosphere was NULL! And I mean Nada, none. Granted it was HH in Wednesday but this place was BORING!"}
{"text":"I actually liked it lol it was my anniversary and we decided to try it one more time and... Thomas our server was great ;) food was good drinks were good and I even liked my dessert! Thanks for the great service and dinner yum"}
{"text":"This place is extremely slow today. We put in our order over 30 minutes ago, the waitress is ignoring us, and other tables seated after us have gotten their more complicated orders before our very simple order. The food is usually pretty good, but I'm not impressed with the service today. They do have gluten free soy sauce and a gf menu which is nice.  Edit: there was TEMPURA in one piece of my philly roll. I have celiacs disease and could get very sick from this. Fortunately I bit into it and noticed immediately. Took almost an hour to get our incomplete order, and we still haven't seen the easiest piece of our order. Very upset about this. When you tell someone you have a disease and they don't take your safety seriously, I find it to be a serious disappointment. The manager Hoon was nice but it won't keep me from getting ill :("}
{"text":"Good happy hour! Gets a little pricey after having drinks but always happy with the food!"}
{"text":"WOW! That is all I can say. I have been to hundreds of restaurants. Service can vary from place to place and but NEVER in the history of my eating (15-20 years) have I ever been refused a return when food is not up to par.  So we decided to try Kabuki in Westgate for the 1st time. I am always looking for good Sushi in the West Valley and there are a few decent places but nothing compares to Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale, AZ.  The hostess was the best part of the experience. She was courteous and smiling and actually was the most helpful to us in the end. Our sever was a nice friendly guy and overall I didnt have any problem with the service. I would have hoped he would have gone to bat for us a little more or even fluffed his Manager's response to not ruin our meal, but he was young and terribly honest.   We ordered a Fried Calamari appetizer and another dish with Tuna that I cant remember along with 3 rolls. The problem was that when the Calamari Appetizer came I was hit with a wiff of Fish!!!! It was very hard (over cooked). I tried a few pieces. I didnt really care for their version of a dipping sauce.  So as I do in any other restaurant, I told the waiter to take it back, and I would gladly order something else. He came back and said: \"All I could do was get you 50% off because my manager tasted it, and he didnt think it tasted bad...\"  WHOAAA!!!!  1) I was a restaurant manager for 5+ years and I have never eaten the food of a plate that came back from the dining room. I actually had a long talk one time with a bus boy who I caught doing that. I actually bought him dinner out of my pocket I felt so bad for him. I doubt the manager was hungry.....  2) Does it really matter what the manager thinks of the food, its what the customer believes. I also NEVER returned food without going to the table and personally finding out whats wrong, show compassion for their unhappiness, and make them feel like we cared.  So after the waiter brought the dinner, by that time we started losing apetite. I finally told the waiter that I would like to see the manager. He comes to the table and the 1st words out of his mouth was :\"Whats the problem here.... \" with an attitude of disgust (like I would rather be sitting on a cactus then be here right now).  This type of service from a restaurant manager is completely un-accpetable. We ate maybe 25-50% of the food and paid full price for almost all of it. They did remove the Calamari but it really didnt matter... the damage was done.  I have been able to send back Lobster at Red Lobster. In this case it was an $8.95 calamari appetizer and I was actually going to buy something else.  This brings me to my question of the day.... Has the West Valley area around Westgate lost the customer focus due to the heavy tourist traffic.... Has anyone else had bad service here on in the Westgate restaurants... I would love to hear your comments  www.crediblyedible.com"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night, my plans had changed and some friends told me to meet up with them for some Sake and Sushi, who can say no to that? So off I went!  Ordered a few rolls for friend I to share, we went with the Vegas Roll, Lotus on Fire Roll and Sunkissed Roll.  The Vegas roll was cream cheese, salmon, krab and avocado deep fired, it was good, just not my favorite, it's a textured thing I guess, not really into fired sushi, but my friend loved it.  The Sunkissed roll was spicy tuna roll with salmon & sliced avocados on top of it, this was a great tasting roll.  My favorite was the Lotus on fire, a California roll with spicy tuna & jalapenos & lotus root on top, delish! The perfect amount of heat too!   Everything was fresh, and service was great too, and since Kabuki is practically in my back yard I am sure I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place ... Michael you are a awesome waiter :).   The sushi is always good and the iced green tea is great !"}
{"text":"My family decided japanese sounded like a good idea and took a trip down to Tivoli Village. There food was delicious, and th price made me look twice. I had expected quality japanese food in Tivoli village to be throught the roof, but many of hte plates were sitting at about $8.95! I had a quail egg shooter just for fun, which was...well...fun. There Ginger dressing on my salad was some of the best ive ever had, and the server even sent me home with some extra! My main course was the spicy ramen, which pretty much stuffed me. I dont recall the desserts due to being stuffed out of my mind, but it was all great. Price, quality, service, all five stars!"}
{"text":"I loved HH here. so I thought lunch would be great.  The service was slow, the music was loud, and the food was ok.  Maybe it was an off day, we were the first table for the day???"}
{"text":"After the movies, we headed for Kabuki's. We got a table pretty quickly. We did not sit at the sushi bar, but it was facing it. The wait service was OK. Drink refills were a little slow.   Ordered:  Gyoza - Not bad  Sliced (raw) beef - Excellent  Yellowtail/Hamachi - Super (big slices of fish)  Tuna/Maguro - Good  Octopus/Tako - Good  Chicken & Beef Terriyaki - OK  Miso soup - Good  Char sui ramen - Had better, noodles tasted packaged store bought  Iced green tea - YUM   The prices were not too bad.  Wanted to order the Fatty tuna/Toro but they ran out.  WHAT?  For a Saturday night, you do not have Toro???"}
{"text":"the ONLY place for sushi!  Casual and elegant, the eel roll is the bomb!  Great service, get Jaime or Steven to serve you, they are the best.  Great locatino and fun people watching while downing some really fresh treats."}
{"text":"Kabuki is my absolute go to for sushi. I have been a customer here for about a year and and half and I absolutely love this place every single time.   The rice (sushi) is perfect! Just enough vinagre and it's at the correct temperature. Always consistent! My fiancé and I always order the salmon and yellowtail nigiri to start off with. I have never liked salmon all that much before I tried it at kabuki- I would eat it but mostly avoided it. Now I can't go to this place without ordering the salmon nigiri it is so smooth and silky the flavor is amazing I've never had salmon that tasted like this before. Don't get me started on the yellowtail!! The quality of the fish is far above any sushi place I have tried in the east valley and I've been to them all on multiple occasions.   Kabuki's food is consistent 100% of the time. It's a little on the pricey side but I'm also a big believer in you get what you pay for. Can't expect quality high grade stuff for pennies right?   The best time to go to this restaurant is during the week when it's a bit slower. The weekends gets crazy busy at this location and the service will not be as quick as when you go during the week. The waitresses and waiters are always super friendly and accommodating. This is my #1 recommend sushi restaurant in the east valley without a doubt. Try the albacore crunch roll it will change your world."}
{"text":"*Be sure to check-in here on Yelp for your FREE California Roll! *  I came here on a Friday night with a friend for an early dinner. I had seen mixed reviews about the happy hour service so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I generally try to keep an open mind about these things until I've experienced the restaurant for myself. Hey, you don't earn the Maverick badge by following the pack!   And so our culinary adventure at Kabuki began with placing our names on the wait list to build the anticipation. I take it as a good sign that this restaurant was quite busy and it was only 6:30p. We enjoyed the beautiful fall weather outside while we waited and were delighted to hear our name called within 10 minutes - much sooner than anticipated.   We were seated at a table and promptly asked for our drink order. We opened our menus and I was pleased to see there was a photo displayed for each dish, which made it hard to decide because they all looked delicious! We decided on 2 specialty rolls and a \"little baby tuna roll\" (as my friend said).   -Tuna Roll ($4.95)- 6 tiny pieces (also known as Norimaki or a \"nori roll\"): nothing special  -Sunkissed ($10.95) - Spicy tuna roll topped with Fresh Salmon and slices of avocado: decadent and delicious!  -Rainbow Roll ($11.95) - California Roll topped with fresh slices of an assortment of fish (tuna, yellow tail, salmon, shrimp): quite delicious and beautifully prepared  Overall, I was quite happy with Kabuki Japanese Restaurant. Sadly, there was no Kabuki theater performance but there are large flat screen TVs for those that want entertainment during happy hour. The server took a little while to confirm our sushi order, but he was friendly enough and came to refill our waters. He even a arranged to have the patio door closed as it was creating a draft for my friend. The sushi may not be \"fresh off the boat\" because well, where's the nearest ocean in Tempe? But the quality of the fish is certainly better than most other sushi restaurants. You'd have to venture up to Scottsdale and pay significantly more to find better sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and had a great experience each time. The kids menu is really great. Their drink list is excellent with a nice selection of beers, cocktails, and sake. The last time I was there I had the tonkatsu ramen and the pork had delicious flavoring and was grilled on one side.  They even brought out a nice ice cream dish for an anniversary lunch."}
{"text":"Nasita and Elda were very talented at sushi  making.  Fresh and delicious.  Presentation was beautiful.  Very loud. Don't sit in the middle of the sushi bar they set the out going orders there and are constantly going over your head or around you."}
{"text":"My go too sushi spot on Saturdays! Once a month without fail! Only negative is the long long wait times. We wait sometimes for two hours just to dine in but that's on weekends and at dinner"}
{"text":"i think the main thing i enjoyed the most about the place was how the interior design n decor looked.  The sushi was very nicely presented and the boat lunch special was HUGE.. feeds a whole family for sure, but the taste of everything was okay. Nothing bad, but not thing great that would blow me away.  price: i dont really remember what i paid for  location is in a shopping center not too far off the strip, so we did some quick walking around after."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices were good.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers and couldn't finish everything.   The mushroom miso soup was delicious.  We had edamame, sushi, sesame chicken, dynamite, tempura.  It was all good--not incredibly special, but definitely a good value."}
{"text":"Well, 3 years later I still love this place. I don't come here very often since I am not in the area that much. I'm sure if I lived close by I would frequent this place on a biweekly basis.  The good news is the owner has done a good job with the upkeep so the place still feels clean and new. The menu is still huge with an offering for every palate. My friend and I ordered 3 appetizers this time and it was plenty for the two of us. Like I've written before, if I lived closer, I would eat here more often!"}
{"text":"I hate to give such a bad review of this restaurant, because my first visit was quite nice. The food was great and ambiance was pleasant, however upon returning to this location, the customer service has made up my mind that I won't be back.   While the food remained to be good, a few bad interactions killed the entire experience for me.   We arrived and to our surprise had no line ahead of us. The hostess ignored us for a while, even after I walked right up to the counter in front of her and verbalized that we would like a seat, not saying anything, she then walked away. A few moments later people started to arrive to the restaurant and she came right in and began immediately seating every group. I had to walk back up and verbalize that she should seat us, before she did so.  Once seated and already halfway through eating, we were brought out the wrong rolls upon ordering a second round of sushi. When I mentioned it to the waiter, rather than be sure we received what we wanted, he argued with me that what he brought is what I asked for and that's how it is always served. (Even though we had ordered the exact same roll at the start of our meal and got a completely different one...the right one). The waiter continued to argue with me and finally, after being told he could bring us something different and charge us for both, we sent him away, finished the food and left in a rather bad mood.  Despite the wrong food being brought out, the tools were tasty however the money paid was not worth the frustration it caused."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent diner at Kabuki for three years. This place is my favorite restaurant. I honestly have tried different Japanese restaurants all over Las Vegas and  none of them come close to Kabuki. Kabuki's waiters and waitresses are bursting with kindness and tons of personality. I always venture out and try different things on their menu and I always end up falling in love. I am never disappointed with Kabuki. I  Kabuki."}
{"text":"I know that there are a ton of choices for sushi here in Las Vegas, but Kabuki never misses the mark.  The location is good (near movies and bars that are on the south side of the strip) so most of the people that go in seem to be locals.  The prices are reasonable.  The atmosphere is great whether you are at a table or at the bar/lounge.  And the rolls are amazing."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times no alway had a great experience and amazing food. We have had the osusume sushi table a few times and are never disappointed. It has a variety of delicious rolls and can be shared between two or more people depending on how much you like to eat. Drinks are always delicious and the calamari and edamame are good also."}
{"text":"I cannot understand how this place has a 4-star rating... I was not satisfied with anything at all.   My friends and I walked in around 6. The restaurant was fairly empty, and we got our table immediately.  We ordered a variety of food. 3 of 6 dishes were recommended by our waitress because we could not decide what we wanted. One of them was their $18 Udon Pasta. I DO NOT recommend this dish at all. It tasted like udon noodles in mulky seawater. The rest of the dishes were not much better. Their sushi did not taste fresh, the rolls did not have any taste, and the cod fish was dry. Basically, we did not like any of their food...  The service was average. The waitress was friendly and nice, but she was lost  half the time. We had to ask multiple time to get more water and drink. At least she was nice.  I just don't see how they have a 4-star rating... Maybe I should try again later."}
{"text":"Ahhhh... Good ol' Kabuki. My usual destination when I come to Town Square. I try my best to come during Happy Hour (3:00-6:00pm, M-F)  so I can get some cheap sides with my Tonkotsu ramen. This past Friday, I decided to give their Happy Hour sushi a whirl. They really only had some pretty basic rolls on the menu (not too surprised by that) and yet, it ended up about the same price as AYCE elsewhere. Bummer..."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a light lunch before flying home. Great food. Will come back the next time I am in town"}
{"text":"Let's start with GREAT location..it's funky, good music, great people watching, if it's not too hot definitely try the patio. That's what we did.  So my friends and I decided to eat at this place before hitting the Pink concert. Started off with some cocktails..We had a Blue Moon, Chi Chi and Tsunami, all very different and all delicious..and they weren't watered down which is always a plus!. So cocktails..check. Sushi..I like unique rolls and most of their rolls were pretty average as far as menus go. Nothing too funky to catch my eye. I ended up with the Lotus on Fire Roll (spicy tuna, lotus root, and Jalapeno on top of a california roll) and I was happy with my choice. I could have had it more spicy but i guess that's what sriracha sauce is for right? My friends had some other rolls and there were no complaints. Sushi...check. Dessert.. Banana Tempura, Chocolate Pyramid Anglaise, Hazelnut Cappucino Torte. I had the banan and tried theirs.. i like mine the best, it was amazing, however they seemed to enjoy theirs, again no complaints. dessert...check. I will definitely go back and try an entree next time.  I noticed that a few people over priced at all, pretty average as far as sushi, dessert and cocktails go during non HH hours... maybe compared to kyoto bowl...I guess take those comments with a grain of salt since you don't know what they're comparing it to.   Regular non HH pricing..It's a little bit less expensive than Roka, more expensive than Akai Hana..same as Kyoto (not bowl) and RA.   There were 3 of us.. 5 cocktails between us, 3 sushi rolls, 3 desserts.. bill was approx $32/ea"}
{"text":"So we ended up going to Kabuki for a quick dinner. Perfect between 6-7pm coz that's happy hour and got to order some of our favorite appetizers at a discount and of course nothing beats the original kani salad. Just ask if them to prepare the original and they'll know what you're talking about. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our initial visit to Kabuki was a solid four and thought we would come back again for a special occasion. This time the restaurant was much less busy, but that unfortunately did not translate to better service. Our server, JP, came to get our drink order and it was a good 15 minutes before he emerged for our final order (he was no where to be seen until then).  We shared an order of the Seafood Hibachi because it included the soft shell crab we loved last time along with extra veggies and seafood. We also ordered a spider roll and sesame chicken.   The soft shell crab on the hibachi was not as good as the other, I presume maybe the added moisture from the other items? Or maybe it was sitting longer? Or perhaps the food here is just not consistent? The green beans on the hibachi were so overcooked I could strain them through my teeth. The beansprouts were ok, the shrimp were ok, and the mushrooms were so small (I don't know why they bothered). The hibachi was not worth it. The rest of the food was good, but nothing spectacular.   When I had asked the server for a couple of larger plates to put the food on, he pointed to the small ones already at the table no wider than my small cell phone. JP advised me that was all they give their customers and seemed confused on why I would even be asking. I was frustrated with his response and said, \"nevermind.\" The small plates are typically used for appetizers and small things, not all sorts of vegetables and rice and meat.   We struggled eating everything off of these ridiculously small plates, and JP did not so much as ask how the meal was. JP also forgot to get our Japanese iced green tea latte, but at least we didn't get charged for it either. Again, it was another round of wait and seek to get our bill and finally get out of there. We left annoyed, unsatisfied, and quite frankly it was just not worth the special trip there, Red Mask Club or not. It was so disappointing we are going to have to go celebrate our special occasion again, somewhere else."}
{"text":"Lots of really bad reviews for this place on the customer service side.   I have been here a few times with all sorts of people. We were never disappointed. Yes, its not your local Japanese sushi spot, but the service is good, the drinks are spot on and the sushi is delicious.  People should have their expectations set when they are going to a sushi spot in Tempe Marketplace on a friday or saturday night. Of course there will be a little wait sometimes (I've never personally waited more than 5-10 minutes)."}
{"text":"A really classy and fun experience here.  Sushi is great and they have a wonderful array of options to choose from. The Dragon or the Rainbow are always a hit. The seaweed salad is a popular option here. They also have a decent vegetarian menu.   Service has been really wonderful here."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places to dine from time to time. I enjoy the small plates and the Vegas Roll is one of my favorites. However, the operation seemed to be in disarray upon my last visit. They were sold out of three requested items on the menu and over thirty minutes passed between the arrival of the first and last entree to the table. Simply put, service was subpar."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer and Red mask club member to Kabuki for going on 10 years now and have recently become very disappointed with the direction of your company. I was dedicated to your restaurant due to reasonably priced dishes and good service and environment. My wife and would come here at nearly once a week and sometimes more. However based on my last visit to your glendale Arizona restaurant, I'm not sure how often I'll come back if at all. I am thoroughly disappointed in the amount your prices have risen over the past year. What was once reasonable and affordable prices are now prices that reflect a high end sushi restaurant in say vegas or LA. Just as examples, your shrimp tempura roll has over the years gone from well under $10 to now over $12 (prices based on memory), your dragon roll has gone from $12 to now $17. These are not prices reflective of the cities in Arizona you are catering to. Along with the prices I was displeased to find out that you no longer supply complimentary edamame to your guests. It wasn't much, but this small and inexpensive gesture was just what you needed to show that you cared about your customers. I am deeply saddened that I will most likely not be coming back to what was once my favorite all time restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi with great environment. Visiting from California  and this place is pretty awesome. What made it even more better is our waitress Sammi... she was pleasant, polite and very friendly! :) thank you"}
{"text":"Great price/performance.  We had the omakase sashmi, black cod, black mussels, tongkatsu ramen, tempura udon, and salmon skin salad.   All were good to very good.  The big surprise was the omakase came with fresh grated wasabi that was fairly potent.  It's a great place for the family, we brought the kids and they loved the noodles."}
{"text":"I think I expected the rice vinegar to accompany my cucumber salad. The dynamite roll was a California roll topped with lobster meat, mushroom and eel sauce. I have been here before but the roll lacked flavor n t the cucumber salad made up for it. Jerelle is awesome! Attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We tried Kabuki after a day of seminars and had a pleasant delicious meal. I thought reverse happy hour was 8pm, it's 9pm contrary to other reviews. We didn't want to wait half an hour so we ordered. We enjoyed a delicious sautéed asparagus cooked with almonds, sesame seeds and a teriyaki sauce. We also shared a tempura app, California and large rolls. All were yummy. At 9pm the happy hour option was presented but we were good. Nice eatery, good service. Our wait person got stuck with a terrible table so another staff  member stepped in to take care of us. Good food and service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner here on my last visit. We were a party of 3 & got up sample a few dishes. The portion of each dish was very generous. The sushi was fresh & tasted wonderful. They showed creativity with plating. The service was fast & friendly. I love the edamame for starters as well.   Definitely will go back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and I have to work so I decided to treat myself to Kabuki. They delivered my food and forgot my salad again this happened 2 weeks ago and it happened again. When I called to tell them, the girl responded by saying you want to come pick it up?  Heck no I'm at work and that's why I had it delivered that cost me $8 by the way. How rude and inconsiderate. She said I don't know what to do. Well I do.. I won't eat there anymore. Thanks for stressing me out on my birthday!"}
{"text":"I ordered spicy miso ramen, sashimi, and bbq ribs here. The servers were really nice and the food was generally well prepared. I particularly liked the sashimi plate because the sashimi was really fresh. I highly recommend this place for dinner or lunch if you are staying at one of the nearby hotels."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok! Nothing fancy. Most rolls, even their specialty rolls are very basic. I prefer multiple types of fish and sauces on my sushi. The teriyaki chicken looked very good. It was nice to save a few dollars on the sushi during happy hour!"}
{"text":"ok, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a sushi bar. i love this place because for dinner i rarely eat rice but need clean vegetables, preferably a salad but not iceberg lettuce crap. kabuki has a few very good salads. i usually get the mizuna grapefruit salad. absolutely delicious! and i go for straight sashimi, no excessive rice rolls. their fish tastes fresh. one of the few places that has premium wasabi you can order, which is the real root chopped up, not the dried wasabi paste that you get free. they also have grilled asparagus! and a very decent drink menu. i usually order the lychee martini, very good!"}
{"text":"Although the service was kinda slow from the server, the chef's at the Sushi bar were very quick, and made the sushi rolls with care. They have a very nice selection of rolls, and everything tasted fresh and clean  I enjoyed everything I ate here, and the Chef's were very nice. They always greet you when you come in, and thank you when you leave. Each one of them."}
{"text":"I'm hoping my latest trip to Kabuki was a fluke. Although the sushi rolls were prepared nice (and they were tasty), the teriyaki chicken was tough and overcooked and the windows in the restaurant were a mess! Is it too much to ask for a quick wipe-down of the windows before you open? It made us feel like uncomfortable!  Other than that, they serve edamame with the purchase of a sushi roll and it was tasty.  The service was great - I only had to ask for a refill once. The place wasn't approx. half-full so I'm sure service was easy to keep up with.  I'm hoping my next trip there will be cleaner and tastier. If not, it will be my last."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place.  The sushi is not very well rolled...they aren't tight and will fall apart as soon as you try to pick them up with your chopsticks. The ingredients aren't terrible which makes it at least edible but I'd avoid the rolls if you can.   Surprisingly they are usually pretty busy so there might be a wait for a table but the bar should always have a few spots open. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and offers a very fun atmosphere for dinner with some friends.   I wouldn't be back for the food but for drinks ...possibly.   You won't leave feeling satisfied but if you're starving while shopping in Town Sq. I guess this will do."}
{"text":"Updated review: went back to here after having not the best experience last time. This time was better! I went when it was really busy, and have to say that the sushi tasted much better! The service was sadly still not up to par.   Food: got the BBQ ribs (I think that is what they were called) as an appetizer. They were delicious and would highly recommend them! For sushi got California roll, delicious, the Alaskan, also amazing and the gold rush, can't go wrong with it!   Service: we were seated at the sushi bar. Sushi chef was very nice, but our server ignored is for quiet a while until we were able to order apatite.    All-in-all, a much better experience and I will keep in coming, just don't want to have another poor experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food very much but the service needs a little bit of work in my opinion. Upon being sat it took us multiple times of asking people to get a waiter so that we could order drinks and food. The food was good but when service is slow it is going to lower my score for the place. There was a dish that was forgot and the waiter failed to ask if we wanted to order more beer. The other issue I had was we went during happy hour and had a menu with certain prices and after we tallied everything up our bill came and was a bit higher with some items having the regular price not the happy hour prices. Brought this to everyone's attention that we could but ultimately nothing got changed so we paid our tab and left to go enjoy some cocktails elsewhere. The food itself would get this place at least a 3 1/2-4 stars, wouldn't say their food is 5 star worthy but the service definitely brings down the score."}
{"text":"While this is a chain sushi restaurant, it was quite satisfying. We were out for a movie in Tempe Marketplace and tried out the sushi. We tried both \"cooked\" sushi and fresh sushi. For this type of sushi place, the prices were reasonable and pretty good.   We had the Dynamite roll, Baked scallop on california roll, and Kabuki roll (crunchy roll topped with various fish selection). The food came out quickly and the service was very friendly. I had no complaints that dinner.   I would come back. Try it!"}
{"text":"Oh my my. Very busy place so the wait is more than an hour but when we first check in with the front desk they say 20-25 mins so we agree to wait. Later on we check back and they say still 20 mins again so we still wait and wait more than an hour they still not having table for us and finally they have table for us but unluckily someone just throw up right in the restaurant and it smell so bad then we have to walk out but they don't even say anything to us.  Bad management bad on timing too When it too crazy busy there are bad service here."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but the food isn't anything close to the quality of sushi I am used to in California. Can't expect much in the desert I guess. The fish has a fishy taste suggesting it's not super fresh"}
{"text":"I am loving the new local menu -especially the sun devil roll ! The service is great,  the food is fresh,  I love how innovative  they are with the new dishes. I try something new each visit lately ."}
{"text":"Kabukiwas recommended to our group by an acquaintance for some good sushi off the strip.  I always am looking for an out of the way place that has good food.  We all decided to have a bunch of different rolls and share with the group.  Kabuki was good, but there were some things I didn't like.    Is place was huge.  From the outside it didn't look that big but the decor and space was very cool.   Service was good as our waitress took care of our needs.    We tried a number of rolls that included the Kabuki Roll, Rainbow Roll, Dragon Roll, Lotus on Fire Roll and Asperagus & Salmon Garlic roll.   All were good, but my complaint is that the California portion of the roll was the salad mixture rather than pieces of crab and cucumber.  I a man not a big fan of that and hence my rating.  If you enjoy that, then your rating might be really different.  I really liked the dragon roll as I enjoy eel and the presentation alone was really cool.    Overall the experience was good, just don't like the way they do the California part of the rolls."}
{"text":"Great sushi, the best California roll I've ever had. Too bad the service made us wait for 30 minutes for our check. It really wasn't even busy. But the waiters was lively and made it up to us with drinks to go and free desert.   We'll be back"}
{"text":"Very good food! Nice variety!  Only problem and quite minuscule problems too; they took quite a bit of time to get us seated, the food took quite a bit of time too and they brought us food all at different times which was disorganized. Other than that the waiters and employees were very attentive and gave us COMPLIMENTARY EDAMAME ! Always a plus! So in fact I give them 4 out of 5 since it was Sunday and supposedly it's busy on Sunday's"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Kabuki for a few years now. The food is beautiful with all the small tetails in place confirming to this guy it is art as much as it is food. The tast is all that you would hope it would be rich, tangy meats and seafood with fresh crisp vegetables. I came on my birthday with friends and of coarse ordered the \"Dream Boat\"...it has everything! This service was always lacking however on this occation our server was attentive, knowlegable and an amazing personality. Thank you so much for a great birthdat night out. Dennis Hicks"}
{"text":"We decided to try Kabuki before a movie.  It sounded like a nice date night kind of thing.  The prices looked reasonable and there seemed to be a variety of dishes we would like.  Our hopes were shattered.  The atmosphere was loud.  Very loud.  It is customary for the host to shout when about to seat someone.  When the rest of the staff can hear the host over the din of the other shouting patrons and the blasting top 40 station, they shout in response.  We ordered the spider roll as an appetizer, but it came after our entrees.  The roll was good, nothing ground breaking.  The chicken teriyaki was tasty, but needed something besides just chicken (rice and salad on the side).  And they had good miso soup.  The rest was not so good.  The iced green tea tasted like water.  The tonkatsu was dry, and tasted like a mcnugget with barbeque sauce.  The salad was fresh from the bag?  The service was fine, but won't bring us back, especially in light of the food."}
{"text":"Service is always great here!!  Sushi is fresh and not too much rice.  Nice patio, dog friendly and shaded"}
{"text":"Really love this place.... Great sushi, cocktails and decor. The staff is young but really helpful and fun. I enjoyed the Lobster specialty and it was amazing! I am now addicted to the lychee martini too. I shared the vegi tempura and it was the best I ever had.  This place is a perfect spot for a girls gathering or first date. The patio is small but great for people watching in Tempe Marketplace.  And of course there is something for the non sushi eater too!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant :)  Good service, nice location, food is tasty & nicely presented.   I had a Paradise roll & an order of Edamame & I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"I use to come here with a friend twice a week when we were taking classes in the area. We would always sit at the sushi bar. Today we got seated at the table since I had my 3 little nieces, and meeting up a friend. We ordered so much food. We had cold tofu, tuna tartar, calamari, seafood udon (my favorite here), two different kinds of rolls, clam miso soup, scallop sashimi and uni (sea-urchin). The girls liked the calamari and udon noodles, although it's a bit spicy. I didn't really care for the rolls, I think there was too rice. Besides the rolls, everything was scrumptious. My nieces ate and got to color and do little puzzles. They stayed busy while we tried to finish all the food. Nice place to go on a date, meet a friend, or have drinks with a group."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have always been satisfied!  The sushi is amazing! Of course I always get the same thing anywhere I go, baked salmon roll, but it is so good!  The edamame is fantastic, sauteed with garlic and served hot!  MY FAVORITE PART IS THE GLUTEN FREE options they provide!  Soy sauce has gluten in it and for me, I choose not to eat gluten so them having this option helps me out tremendously!  I do not think we have ever waited for a table, not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but I am happy we dont have to wait!  you can chose to sit at the bar, a table or a booth.........so nice to have those options!  You are going to be paying the average price for the rolls, nothing is over priced but it isnt super cheap. I have never had an entree, but my friends got the meal that included chicken, tempura, salad and a bowl of rice.  It looked great and was priced just right for the amount of food they received.   The waiters and waitresses have always been great. I love this place and while writing this review my mouth is watering thinking about the edamame!"}
{"text":"I looove my Asian food and I must say this place gives me a taste of home (Hawai'i). Came here after walking around town square and got seated right away. Ambiance was casual, but definitely has a Japanese atmosphere going on.  We had a tiger roll to start with, which was super tasty. The spicy tuna on top could have been a little more spicy but the taste was still there.  For my entree I got the tempura udon. One of the best udon I've had in a while. It was a pretty generous portion and I somehow managed to finish most of it myself! I liked that the tempura was served on the side with dipping sauce. Some places place the tempura inside the udon and ends up being soggy by the time it's served.   The entree also came with a small salad, which also tasted like home with the oriental salad dressing. Yummy!   Next time, I would like to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical trying to find sashimi and sushi out in AZ when I am used to eating sashimi that melts in your mouth / caught that morning in Hawaii or close to it in CA or NYC. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at this place so it earned 5 stars from me basing it off AZ sushi/sashimi choices."}
{"text":"Great service and outstanding food! Calamari is still one of the best in the area. Sushi is fresh and taste excellent. Military discount available is appreciated. My family and I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"An okay Japanese restaurant off the strip. They have the dark club-y vibe and hip atmosphere. Food is below average to average. Plenty of tables but sometimes there's a wait. Service is decent. Bathrooms are clean. Pretty standard menu with the usuals that you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. Decent prices that won't hurt your wallet.   Chirashi is good. Bento box is a good deal. Ramen too salty. Sushi rolls are average."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Food is consistently good and the beer is cold. Eriko the Manager always greets you with a smile. We sit at the bar for the best service."}
{"text":"My Wife and I had dinner here great food and service the servers are trained well and are very polite, the sushi is very good neat clean slices and very tasty if you like sushi and very good service check this place out."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been coming here since the day that they opened. All was great until the last few times I came in. It's steaming in there the a/c is set so high that I was sweating I was going to leave but wifey was starving so I sucked it up and stayed. So u tell the waitress why is it so hot in here she replies corporate said to set it at a certain temperature WTF!!!! I had to go to the bathroom and wet my head down to cool off!!!!!So we order some sushi rolls and the rolls are half the size that they were before!!! WTF!!! So now I'm really pissed. So here I am sweating and eating the half size sushi rolls. I just wanted to get out of there ASAP so I can get to the car and pump up the A/C!!!  I don't think I'll be going there again in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times I always get the Alaskan roll and a Philadelphia roll my most favorite, as for the Ramen Noodles I wasn't to happy about them I felt they could of used more flavor and as for the environment and staff is very pleasant and the place is very well kept"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed here. We just bought food here for take out earlier today. We ordered the dynamite roll, Philadelphia roll, tempura cali roll, pop rock and baked muscles. The dynamite was easily the worst dynamite I've had. Onions were not diced, few scallops and all were in large chunks, no crab, no peppers, tons of mayo. Muscles were ok, I'd order them again. Tempura roll had very little tempura and just fell apart, the nori never touched. Philadelphia roll was balanced nicely but the rice was again very week and fell apart. Pop rock was supposed to come with dynamite and didn't. Overall it seemed under achieving and we were left wishing we had gone somewhere else. Especially for $47 worth of food. It was take our and we waited 30 min to get it and 15 before we arrived home so of course we stuffed it down. I just wouldn't return with this type of quality."}
{"text":"There was a very short wait when we walked in at 8 pm, 5-10 minutes. I had bariatric surgery and there were many options for me to choose from, but I ordered the broiled snow crab legs. They cut the shell in half, so I didn't have to crack anything open, and they were fabulously flavored with butter and (not spicy) spices. Perfect size for my extra small new stomach. My husband is not the biggest sushi fan, but he got the Vegas roll and it was the best he's ever had. Complimentary edamame was a nice touch. Best of all, this place is super affordable, and we didn't have to wait forever for our food! Two people ate for about $35, and the service is most excellent. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went with a group (6 adults) of friends and my 3 year old.  While I don't eat fish I hoped they had something I would enjoy.  Their menu was awesome.  They had beef, chicken, pork, vegan and vegetarian meals so there was something for everyone.  My daughter got the sesame chicken kids meal and i got the steak teriyaki (everyone else pretty much got raw fish!!!).  the food came out and everyone was happy, my steak was amazing and cooked rare, just like I ordered.  My 3 year old's chicken was amazing, and the portion (for $6) was enough for an adult!  We did a check-in and all got free soup too, so check foursquare to see what they have.  Overall it was a good time, the waitress was on top of our table with food, drinks, and refills even though she had orders to take care of.  I can't speak for the shahimi or sushi, but everyone seemed to be happy with the variety and quality of what they were bringing out."}
{"text":"I'm visiting a friend in AZ and was craving Sushi. We placed a take out order and let's just say its one of the best Sushi places I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is my first choice to dine together with my friends, and I came here about twice a month. There has a theater nearby so we usually come here after watching a movie in weekend. The outdoor seating is my favorite part of this restaurant located in Tempe marketplace. It's really enjoyable when sit in the couch and chat with your friends beside the bonfire. This restaurant is really popular and it usually get a long line of customers in meal time but worth it. The space inside is huge and all the environment inside are elaborately decorated. I like the sushi bar especially because it's so stylish and gives me a visual sense of Japanese culture.  The light effect looks pretty good and the seats are arranged perfectly. Although there have lots of chairs and tables, I don't feel crowded. The waiters and waitress in Kabuki all wear black gives me sense of professional, they serve really good and they pay attention to all our process of meal, like refill on drinks and give us more napkins when we need. They are so nice that we even don't need to raise our hand up to let them know we need to be served. They always have a smile on their face and ask if everything goes okay. For the drinks, I have to say their lemonade is really authentic, the flavor tastes mild and open up my appetite. There is plenty on the menu that you can eat and the images on menu looks exactly same as the dishes come up, good-looking and appetitive.          As always, Kabuki serves us side of free edamame while we waiting for our dishes, and these edamame taste really good. For the dishes, I really recommend the firecracker roll. We can add wasabi and the soy sauce to make our own flavor and these sauce tastes very fresh. For the firecracker roll, this roll stacked with a piece of salmon and it has a crisp lotus root piece and jalapeno, on the sides it's lined with crunchy panko crumbs and mayonnaise based hot sauce. It is so delicious and I like it so much. The price level is like $15-$30 per capita depends on what we order. Rolls cost around $10-$20 and some grilled entrees are generally expensive. I recommend consumers to order happy hour rolls since that's way cheaper. Furthermore, the servers are deserved high tips because of their patience and nice touch. I expect to see more new dishes come out because I've almost tasted all of the dishes except the sakes. Hope to see more creativity on dishes.  Overall, the quality of food, drinks, both exterior and interior design, atmosphere and service are all make me fully satisfied and I have great experiences each time there, if you are interested in choosing a Japanese theme restaurant for lunch or dinner, consider Kabuki, it's a great spot for gathering with your family and friends, definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the bartender were excellent, however the food itself left much to be desired.  A group of myself and 2 friends pulled up to the bar to enjoy their happy hour on a Wednesday afternoon.  Service was prompt and pleasant.  We all took advantage of  the $2 Sapporos.  As soon as the food arrived, our enthusiasm dwindled upon popping the lackluster morsels.  We sampled the calamari, spicy tuna roll, alaskan roll, and the rose roll.  Thinking that some extra sauce could improve the taste, we requested some spicy mayo and eel sauce on the side to no success.  Even the sauces missed the mark.  The fish wasn't overly fresh, just ok.  I wanted to like Kabuki, but unfortunately I can't say that I would consider any further visits."}
{"text":"Over the weekend my three best girlfriends and I ventured out to Westgate for some b-day celebration!  We went to dinner @ Kabuki.    Reservations are not taken on Friday and Saturday when I phoned I was assured the wait wouldn't be much longer the 5-10 minutes.  My g-friends and I arrived a little after 8 p.m. on Saturday.  I walked up to the hostess and put our name in.  I think you can tell a lot by the restaurant by the people working the front of the house.  These were two teenagers working part time who had far too much make-up on and were simply bothered by having to work.  Not a very good first impression.    We walked outside and people watched thinking we only had a 10 minute wait @ the most.  We asked to sit on the patio and when I looked there were 4 tables open.  After 10 minutes we walked into the bar area.  KIRIN on tap!!  Things are looking better.  The little couches outside were available so we sat out there.  Just as we sat down our buzzer went off.  We were walked to our table.  Second to the last table on the patio.    Our waiter arrives.  Tom is going to take care of us.  I let Tom know that it's a b-day celebration and that we can get kinda rowdy.  He's up for the challenge.  We order drinks.  Sake bombers and a vodka drink - everything good so far.  I think Kabuki should be best known for their sushi.  My dinner of chicken/steak teriyaki was good.  It was just run of the mill.  Rice was good.  Everything tasted great.  We had edamame and veggie tempura.  Appreciated the large pieces of veggies.  B-day girl said she had some of the best sushi she has had in a while.  We also tried the steak/asparagus salad.  That was delish.  Spears of asparagus come wrapped in thinly sliced steak.  Perfectly seasoned.  The salad part of the appetizer was a little weighed down by so much dressing but it was good.  Another g-friend had beef sukiyaki.  Holy Sukiyaki this bad boy came out in a huge boiling pot.  It was large.  Tons of veggies, noodles on the bottom and the steak.  Served with salad and rice she loved it.  Too much for one person.  Can and should be shared.    Next time I want to go and get one of the boats.  So many of those were served the night that we were there.  Looked good.    The atmosphere around the restaurant is good.  It can get rowdy.  There is a bar next to the restaurant with smoking allowed outside.  The night that we were there we got to see two fights.  First one started by the guys and then their women followed up.  The women were later put in  cuffs.  It was exciting."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here believe it or not!  WOW! What I was missing. What a great place! We walked in and the staff was so friendly. We were seated immediately and as we walked through, it was beautiful in there. Warm and inviting. We had the best waitress and absolutely impressed she remembered our order without taking it down on paper!  The food was excellent and in fact, the lunch entree I had was such a good amount, had to carry out the rest! We will definitely be back again and would highly recommend this tasty and awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and this was my first time here and it was wonderful. My nephew had never tried sushi but was willing so we stopped in here before hitting the movie theater. He loved everything, even the tuna. And I wish I could marry the salmon skin roll! We ate three between us. Fast, friendly service. I will definitely east here again when I'm back in town, and my nephew is making plans become a regular."}
{"text":"Holy moly! This is the greatest spot ever!!!! The Baja roll is a personal favorite for me! It's a bit spicy but it will make your taste buds dance!!! And the Soy Ramen--- good heavens you won't want Ramen from any other spot once trying this dish! It's a must eat! And it also has a great location amongst the locals and travelers!"}
{"text":"Always great service and good food.  Steak teriyaki and tempura all cooked perfectly.  Sushi was very fresh."}
{"text":"We came for Happy hour.  Monday - Thursday 4-6  Make sure to park by AMC as there is very few parking spots know front and all are Pay parking.   I was pleasantly surprised to find out they have a brand new vegaterian and gluten free menu.   I had the tomato,  mushroom and tofu sushi and it was Delish.    The seaweed salad was also a generous portion size.   The service was good.  Prices were good if you can go at happy hr you can get a Veggie roll for 3$ and there is a large selection.   My only. Complaint is The bathroom definitely needs a clean."}
{"text":"WOOHOO!! I have found my sushi restaurant! The food is soo good, the service very polite and knowledgeable. I would say the only thing that could be improved on was their rolls could be rolled a bit tighter. Otherwise, we will be returning!"}
{"text":"We are a regular here took a cousin out for a birthday celebration today they had a complimentary ice cream for her that was nice.  I think when I want any Japanese food just come here never failed. Try any flavored iced tea too they all are good.  Service is always on point. we had lunch specials today all were okay.   Give it a try.  Everything is good on the menu.  They always have special items too."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and amazing people. This is a place to eat at Westgate. Happy hour is the best. Every staff member was friendly."}
{"text":"The fish is always very fresh and delicious. We usually get good service. Unfortunately, this place is listed as \"gluten free friendly\" when it is not. Yes, they have gluten-free soy sauce, but on all but one occasion I have had to ask for it multiple times and then go get it myself.   The manager told me that ALL of their sauces, including the mayo, have wheat in them. The only way to get gluten-free sushi here is to get everything with NO sauce. They add wheat-based soy sauce and wheat seasoning to all the sauces, which is totally unnecessary. I mean, mayo does not need wheat or soy sauce added.  Unfortunately, none of the wait staff alerted me to this until I had visited several times! I had ordered various things and asked questions about wheat content, and no one ever told me that the sauces all have wheat in them.   The wait staff and the manager were very reluctant and resistant to the idea of just plopping a little plain mayo or ponzu or other sauce on a plate for me. After I asked over and over, the manager did bring me a little bit of mayo, but I should not have had to ask over and over. It's just mayo, they do not make mayo in-house, and it is a matter of service.   Also, when I asked questions about wheat-free items, our waiter directed me to the vegan menu. He did not understand the difference between vegan and gluten-free: he thought it was the same thing.   I really loved Kabuki and went there about 2-3 times a month before I found out that there was hidden wheat in all the sauces. So, I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"First Japanese restaurant I've attended. Like the atmosphere and the friendly service. Getting practice eating with chop sticks,  it gets better with time. The food is nicely pepared, colorful and tasty dishes to my liking with a great portion just enough for my appetite. Great location."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Kabuki, but will be generous and round up my 3.5* review to a 4* because of an event they recently threw.  Last week they had a sake tasting party, which also happened to have a limited AYCE buffet of fresh sushi and a few beers.  Total cost for this event?  $25 flat.  That's better than a lot of the AYCE restaurants around town.  Granted, there were only a few different types of nigiri & rolls out, but the event was more about the sake.  I got to taste lots of (I assume) pricey sake, and a few typical Japanese beers.  The whole event was well run (if under-publicized) , and an amazing value.  As for the restaurant itself, I really can't review it.  From what I can tell, it looks like a \"normal\" sushi restaurant that is a bit overpriced.  I'd prefer to go to my hole in the wall AYCE sushi place around the corner for $21.95 than order from a menu and probably spend more."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. My mom and I received a 2 for 1 coupon in the mail and we went there open minded. As soon as we walked in we were properly welcomed and guided to the sushi bar. Quick review: Staff was quick, manager stopped by said hello asked us how we liked it, redeeming our coupon not a problem, food was excellent.   Ill be honest my mom was a bit down and the overall experience brought a smile back to her face! 5 star highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Normally the service here is great. Tonight was not a good night. Never got our waters.  My partner got his main course before mine and the appetizer. The dumplings were cold. And He was almost done by the time my food arrived. The sashimi was cut too thick.  The overall experience was just bleh."}
{"text":"I love Kabuki!  They are a little more Americanized than other Japanese restaurants, but that's a good thing. I'm in love with sushi but a lot of my friends aren't. We can always compromise on this place.  The happy hour is awesome, the menu used to be bigger but it's still cool. I love their fusion rolls. If you like Mexican food, try the Baja roll, you won't be disappointed. The service has always been great both in Town Square and Tivoli. The staff is very attentive and educated on their menu. I've never had a bad experience here. If you like this place, it's worth it to get the Rewards Card."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe in the evening. Nice lighting and ambiance throughout. Usually when I come we hang out inside of the bar area. They have some really interesting asian inspired drinks that are tasty and delicious. They have a nice variety of food from sushi to a few americanized asian favorites. i'll be back.. ! for sure!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and got a lot more food than I was expecting, and it was incredibly good. It was very well priced and service was great. I will diffently be going back here."}
{"text":"Kabuki just might be the restaurant that makes me quit trying new places because they happen to be in the area where I'm running errands (I've had terrible luck with this lately), but that's how a friend and I found ourselves there after doing some shopping in Town Square.  Service issues abound. When we walked in, the host was on the phone. So we waited. And waited. Finally, rather than get off the phone, he just handed us menus and told us to seat ourselves. Seriously? We were not sure we should actually just seat ourselves at a random table in the dining room, so we carried our menus like vagabonds and headed over to the sushi bar.   The food wasn't necessarily terrible; just mediocre and stinking of a lack of execution and effort. The \"Niku Kushiyaki\" was tough and way too salty, nothing like the tender, well-marinated version you'd find in authentic Japanese restaurants - especially disappointing as it's $6 for a very small portion (2 small skewers). The \"Steamed Clam\" on the menu mentions sake, so I hoped for something like asari sakamushi. Don't make that mistake, as it's nothing close. Kabuki adds soy sauce and it just overpowers everything else.  My friend ordered two rolls; I forget Kabuki's names for them, but basically a dragon roll and a baked crab roll. The rolls were not made well and were sliced super thinly to boot, so nearly every piece disintegrated when we tried to pick them up. Also, the rolls took forever to arrive (around 20 mins after we finished appetizers, even though we ordered them at the same time). My sushi (saba, hamachi, sake) was actually passable, although maybe it's just because my expectations were lowered so much by all the lousy dishes that preceded it.  I admit I agonized a bit over giving a +1 because the sushi chef and busboy were very friendly (and the busboy is the only reason we ever got our drinks refilled, as our waitress just ignored us or forgot) - but I just can't do it. Again, it's not that anything was so terrible, but that nearly everything was bad or at best, mediocre. Even if you're in Town Square and need a sushi/Japanese fix, go somewhere else or manage your fix for another day."}
{"text":"I never ever write reviews on yelp, ever. But this was too great not to share. Went here last night to celebrate a friends engagement and it was fantastic! Not only was the food great, the service was amazing! Lynn was our server and she had the best customer service I have ever had. She was friendly and made sure we always had what we need. I never had to ask for a refill on my drink because she was constantly on top of it. I had talked to the manager to let him know what an awesome job they did and they were great as well, let us know that if we ever had any problems in the future to let him know. They truly care about there customers and I will tell everyone I know if they want good food and good service to go here! Be sure to try their fried ice cream too ;)"}
{"text":"I love to eat at Kabuki when I'm craving sushi. The servers are always friendly and the atmosphere is nice. The food is a bit pricey but it's worth it. I never leave unsatisfied. The sushi is amazing and they also have ramen which is a huge plus in my book. The presentation of the food is always nicely done."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant. Kid friendly! We enjoyed our meals especially the Spicy Ramen! Better than my favorite sushi spots! It's def. worth getting! The tempura mix was good and the sushi was really nice and delicious. The spot is hard to find in this type of drive around mall but it's near the movie theatre if the helps!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to.  The food is delicious, on point, and always hits the spot.  They have a very large selection for everyone and their combination plates are a great price for the portion and quality of food.  Kids meals are also a great size and quality for the price.  The Red Mask points card is also a must to get if you come here, because you will be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"If me getting carried out by my bf is any indication that the Sake specials are great well then.... Happy hour is great here, the prices are too bad but it just makes it easier on the wallet when you get one and the second for a dollar. The atmosphere is nice, the menu has so much to offer, i admit i don't remember what i ate, but ah the Sake got me!  The front staff were okay but our waitress was helpful and responded to us in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and service w as quick. The waiter was the best and suprised me with a fork when he saw me struggling with my chopsticks."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, very affordable, that staff is extremely friendly, and there is a server named Jay that always helps us that is outstanding. The man has a photographic memory and will  get your order started before you get your drinks. Highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a great Japanese style of cuisine"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great energy of that entire Mall. The server that we always ask for is Jesse. Always takes the order Perfect and the food comes out in a very reasonable time. I highly recommend Kabuki for Asian Cuisine"}
{"text":"So this night we were \"one of those customers\" that comes in a half-hour before closing time. Lol. We were hungry so why not? It was their \"Reverse Happy Hour\" which I think it a stupid name. To them it just means a happy hour at a later time. Anyway, we loaded up on the specials! Edamame is served on the house as well which was fresh and tasty. We ordered the Tokyo Quesadilla, Calamari Rings,a Spicy Tempura Roll and Las Vegas Roll. Everything was fantastic. The Tokyo Quesadilla took me by surprise because it was basically a mozzarella stick, but in a pot sticker casing! Delicious. Our serves were also very attentive to making sure we had everything we needed and keen at giving us suggestions. I'd totally come back here."}
{"text":"Showed up here recently to grab a bite before a movie.  I will admit that for some reason the Kabuki's in AZ are much better than the ones in CA so please keep that in mind.  We sat outside and because the weather was really nice it occured to me that if people watching is your thing this is the place for you.  Just make sure you sit outside.  I ordered the chicken samboro which was excellent.  I started it off with a kale salad that was perfect.  The atmosphere was pleasent.  We got there at 6pm on a friday and it seemed like the crowd was a mix of business people wrapping up meetings, people getting before dinner drinks and families trying to have dinner before the kids go nuts.  I don't think many people would come here for the cool vibe as much as the food so I didn't have a high expectation.  I have to give three stars because it's always awkward to me that when we arrive there are a lot of available tables and they make you wait as if you were trying to get in to Studio 54.  Not sure what that is about.  Who are they checking with?  Nothing seems to really change excpet the time that has passed between when we arrive and when we get seated.  At any rate, the food is good and I will be back."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for dinner around 9:30pm with my girlfriend. It wasn't too pack, waited a few minutes to be seated. Hostess sat the two of us In a booth, but I ask her can we have the seat at the end, because there was a big party right next to us. She moved us one booth over, and now we're in the middle of the big party. I asked hostess again if we can move to the booth at the end. So hostess moved us to the end booth. As she was moving us hostess gave us the dirties look ever!!. Like she was annoyed and unhappy. So unprofessional! But everything else like service and food was great. 3 out 5 stars due hostess bad attitude."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat at Westgate. Pork belly here served in different ways! Lots of sushi choices & plenty of food for my parents that don't like eating \"raw fish\". Lol   Make sure you sign up for the Red Mask Club, it has saved me hundreds over the years. Especially when my pregnant wife gets a craving for their Ramen or Dumplings!"}
{"text":"Not the best experience, Matthew was our waiter and I'm not sure if he is new or something but we got soup, salad, and rice with our $20 bbq style ribs and we never got it! So at the end after our check comes we asked how come we never got it and he says, \"oh did you want it, should it bring it out now?!\" He should've brought it out in the beginning of the meal before all our our rolls and such came out. Our bill came to $170 plus we tipped him $32, but not going to come back here again. The food was tasty but our service was disappointing. He also forgot to put a roll in so we asked him about that too and he said he forgot and brings it out when we are going to pay and doesn't even Comp it! Wow! Rookie service for sure!"}
{"text":"PROS: -Great happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6pm) -I actually only come here for the HH, and not during the regular hours because of the price LOL (I know, I'm a broke college student) -Fast & friendly service  FOOD 4/5: (All prices are from the happy hour menu) -California Tempura roll ($6.95) -Philadelphia roll ($3.95): Personal favorite, even though it taste the same in every sushi place i go to ... haha -Shrimp Tempura roll ($7.95) -Salmon Skin roll ($3.95) -Overall all the HH sushi are decent but good :)"}
{"text":"the restaurant is HUGE. like enormous. maybe it looked so large because it was so empty, but im not one for huge crowds or elbowing neighbors during dinner.  went here for lunch while waiting for our movie. sat at the sushi bar, where you get an awesome view of...slabs of raw fish. not cool. it would be more beneficial for a sushi bar to allow people to view the making of the sushi vs. looking at fish meat.   after looking at the menu we were completely in awe of how many different types of sushi they offer. they have a special section of the menu with pictures and descriptions of the latest menu additions which is helpful. they serve you complimentary edamame (cold) while you wait and decide. their cocktails looked spiffy, i was a bit disappointed that their calpico was non-alcoholic, but settled on a fav of mine, four peaks kiltlifter. we also ordered a cucumber mojito which was clean, crisp, and refreshing. it was served with large slices of cucumber inside it which were delicious to eat soaked in mojito.  we decided on the volcano roll (baked spicy tuna), lotus on fire roll (a specialty, baked lobster meat and jalepeno on top of a california roll), and a classic philly roll. all three were fantastic. the lotus roll was by far my favorite though, a very interesting piece of sushi i must say (check out the pic). the sauce it was served with was tasty and the jalepeno on top kicked that little sucker up a notch. anything hot and spicy im drawn to and i'd come back to kabuki just for this roll. the volcano rolls were delicious as well, i've never had baked spicy tuna, or really any kind of \"hot\" sushi. all were reasonably priced and although it wasn't happy hour, we didn't manage to spend more than $35 for 3 rolls and 2 drinks.   not bad for a chain japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I've ate here too many times to count since its opened, but I know that every time has been great from customer service to delicious foods/drinks! Happy hour is awesome as well.  If you're in the mood for ramen try the spicy miso ramen bowl flavorful and a nice portion plus it comes with a yummy starter salad that's dressing is to die for! Ask for Linh she is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the sushi is good, but today I was very disappointed with the service and the food. Our waitress was very inattentive, but I left that slip because it was somewhat busy and she seemed to be the only one working the tables.   But what really got me was that our lobster roll came out covered in massive amounts of mayo. I took a bite and my hubby took a bite and literally felt sick from the amount of mayo. The waitress never came back to ask us how our meal was and when she came back to clear the table she asked if we wanted a box. I explained that the roll was not edible, she said \"yeah it does look like a lot of mayo.\" and took it away. She did not ask to replace it or discount our bill. When the bill came, we were charged for the roll. I decided to take that out of her tip.  Bottom line, its a hit and miss with the service and the food."}
{"text":"Busy night but with lots of seat, just a short wait for us.  The food was okay, not the best Japanese food, but the plating and some styling were actually closer to Japanese/Asian food than Americanized Japanese cuisine. There were also some dishes on the menu that are pretty authentic Japanese.  The garlic beef and ishiyaki were good, but the latter had a small portion (but normal for authentic Japanese food, just not American size :P). The quality were pretty good. However the miso soup came with most meals were basically water with miso flavor D: It was so lacking in miso that was almost hilarious.... The hot stone for ishiyaki lost heat pretty quickly, which never happened when I ordered something similar in the past (mostly in Asia), maybe they used a different type of stones.  Service was polite but they were so busy that everything required a wait."}
{"text":"I like to get the Kabuki Deluxe for lunch occasionally; not impressed with their sushi."}
{"text":"Roll and rice and ok. The poke bowl is very good! Net time we will just order poke bowl for each person. Made me want to make sushi rice myself. Service is good. Environment good too."}
{"text":"Love the Happy Hour here!  Or is it that I love saving money while drinking?  All of them there up above!    I'd probably come here only for happy hour as there's a shit-ton of better places to eat Japanese food at.  But when it's this affordable even I would order a cheap-o roll to go with our drinks.  Happy hour is 3PM-6PM on weekdays.  Come abuse it!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for sushi, I like the location, however the noise and inefficiency of some of the staff can be a little tedious. But not so much that I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Kabuki is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour.  I wish they had more sushi rolls on the happy hour menu but the drink selection makes up for it.  Their grapefruit mojitos and lemon drops are especially yummy.  Not to mention, after accidentally dropping and breaking my drink, our server brought me out a new drink with no charge.  :)  I probably wouldn't dine here any other time than happy hour simply because you can get the sushi rolls much cheaper elsewhere, but it's still a a great place."}
{"text":"Gave Kabuki happy hour a whirl on a Monday afternoon.  We were very pleasantly surprised.   The staff was all very attractive and very nice.    The happy hour options are great!  Loads of choices.  The sake sangria and lychee martini were quite tasty but will sneak up on you! Yikes!     It is very nice that the happy hour menu is offered in the entire restaurant.  You don't have to worry about cramming into a tiny bar or lounge space.  We were seated at a nice table just like any other diner.    Kabuki is very nice inside and the food presentation was flawless.  Just about everything we ordered was a win!   The only miss I recall was the tofu appetizer.  Bland and boring.  The fried mozzarella wrapped in seaweed were clever and tasty!  I'll definitely return and you should go check it out!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch a couple of days ago. We had a few people and all of the items ordered were very good. I had the teriyaki chicken lunch box and it was a lot of food for a little over $10. I'll definitely visit here again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is good if you want sushi and something else.  There is no all you can eat option so if you are a big eater you'll be a big spender here.  Staff was friendly, service was excellent! Our drinks were never empty, our food came out quickly and was correct.  It was our first time here. We ordered three different sushi rolls, spicy ramen, garlic edamame and pork gyoza to try a little bit of everything. The ramen was ok, good for a place that is not primarily a ramen spot. I asked for a side of butter and minced garlic to dr up the ramen.  The garlic edamame was excellent!  Seating was comfortable. We were in a 1/2 booth 1/2 table. They had full booth and traditional table & chairs for larger parties."}
{"text":"Despite being delivery, the food was delicious! I had the Salmon teriyaki. Everything was well packed and carefully thought out. The salmon was among some of the best I've had. Cooked to perfection and a tiny bit of fat so it melted together. Definitely recommend them for any meal of the day!"}
{"text":"this place never fails"}
{"text":"I been to town square kabuki long time ago it was ok, so my friend wanna try new one which is rampart  it was terrible . Fish are ok but rice is just plain .... I been so many Japanese restaurant but the sushi rice was so bad. And service ......  Our sever tooks so long time to take our dinner order, I don't know why coz the place was not too busy when I went there. Service was bad food was just okay  I'm not gonna go back...."}
{"text":"I was on vacation with my girlfriend, and we decided to go for Japanese. We tried staying off the strip to avoid the high cost associated with it, and ran into this in the shopping center well over a mile down the road.  We did the communal munch, ordering several dishes and picking at them with our chopsticks. Here's a breakdown of our eats:  * Sunkist Roll: Good flavor to start, but the onion garnish placed on top of the sushi overpowered the taste of the salmon.  * Spicy Tuna over Sticky Rice: Fairly decent. Spicy tuna was comparable to most places and the sticky rice it sat on was decent.  * Oyster Shot in Ponzu Sauce: Are you serious? When did you order this, babe? It was good, but the sauce was definitely a bit salty. Great tasting oyster though!  * Korean Barbecue Short Ribs/Teriyaki Chicken with rice: The Korean BBQ was tender and juicy. I wish I could say the same for the chicken; that was a bit overcooked, making the chicken strips a little on the dry side.  The house salad was overpowered with the flavor of ginger. Definitely not a fan of that.  All in all, great service, the seafood was good in quality and taste, and the staff and décor was spectacular."}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout from this place-- I ordered in the afternoon and they weren't busy at all, but I was still impressed that they had my order (Seafood Nabeyaki Udon (comes with a side salad) and Large Roll) in less than 20 minutes.   The food was good and definitely scratched my udon itch, but it wasn't anything special. Though the udon was more than enough to fill me up, I don't think it was quite worth its price. I did get one of the more expensive noodle dishes though, so I'm excited to try another one to see how it goes!"}
{"text":"Good sushi. We had a pretty good time sitting in the lounge. The wait for the sushi seemed a bit long , but the drinks helped with that. Haha . Had fun, and the servers seemed to work well together . A good Saturday date night . Spicy tuna crispy rice was on point as well as other dishes ! Wish I got the name of our server because he was friendly, and professional to us. Also, the hostess was super sweet . Allison I think was her name. Sending thank you's your way Kabuki !"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with how kabuki changed over the year. Honestly when I went here 3 years ago, food was (blah) didn't taste authentic japanese and wasn't  good for Americanized japanese .   But I recently visited and noticed they changed their menu, looked more authentic! So as skeptical as I am ( I've avoided kabuki for 3 years after the last visit)  I ordered few of their menu.  I was really wowed by amount of japanese izakaya menu they added and I had the tebasaki ( Japanese flavored chicken wings).  It really really tasted like the ones in Japan!  And I had their sea urchin udon which wasn't the best but was ok.    Kids meal sushi plate really is presented like they do kids meal in Japan (minus a toy) !   I was getting really impressed than I read that Japanese Chiefs are improving their menu on yelp, no wonder !  They even have ochazuke and stuff.i hope they add more authentic iZakaya stuff so I don't have to goto Vegas for ichiza anymore.   :). And kids meal is totally worth it for little young sushi lovers ! My kid loves!"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with a sushi spot that doesn't offer AYCE!!!  I don't know how i could of let this happen...  Honestly though, really great sushi experience! I ordered two rolls and it ended up coming out to about what it would've if i payed for AYCE somewhere else so i didn't feel as bad as i thought I would after i finished eating.  One of my rolls was a crab roll, but instead of that imitation crab meat, (which I still love) it was fresh king crab meat and absolutely delicious and worth every penny.  I liked that they offered us complementary edamame before we ordered at the sushi bar and I like how attentive our sushi chef was. The only thing I didn't like was when we got there, there were two hosts there to greet us but neither one of them did they had their backs turned to us reading something and when she turned around she told us to wait a moment so they could seat us. There was nobody there...  All in all I will definitely be back. The food was great and besides our greeting the service was too!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in town. Always fresh and always wanting more. They have a lot of variety on their menus so if you bring a newbie or a sushi hater to this restaurant, even they can be impressed by some of the less fishy items on the menus.   Staff is very kind and always willing to go the extra mile. Great for the family, friends or date night."}
{"text":"Hip, loud, trendy atmosphere on a Friday night. Long wait, wouldn't take our reservation and it ended up being 25 mins longer than quoted. Staff was as friendly as they could be in the fast paced busy night.  Dynamite roll was awesome! Basic rolls were so so. I think it was the cauliflower appetizer that was surprisingly flavorful and a hit with our group."}
{"text":"This place has awesome sushi!! Tried the lava roll and it was the bomb!!! Our other favorite is the dragon roll.  Glad we found our new sushi place to go to!"}
{"text":"We live really close by so convenience is great. What a lovely dinner we just had. Will return. Neville p"}
{"text":"This kabuki is very prompt, kind, and caring. The servers are great, especially Gaby. She's was so sweet with our party of 30 and we had an amazing time !"}
{"text":"Food was good the service was not the best, we waited for over thirty minutes, server said the kitchen was backed up, don't understand as there were very few tables when were there"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in Vegas. The Firecracker is superb. Come in for the late happy hour and get a pitcher of Sapporo with your sushi. Makes for a perfect meal.  I find the sushi here slightly better than the Town Square location."}
{"text":"Excellent FRESH sushi! The best in Glendale/Phoenix yet! Service was good but restaurant VERY crowded...guess that's good thing though. Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I went there two weeks ago on a Friday night and it was amazing :) I never had a bad experience here! Food is delicious and the service is great!!.. And it's on west gate so you can always hit the bars after a great bite !!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese cuisine with a kiss menu and premium sushi.  The presentation of all dishes are artistically done.  If you are in for lunch I recommend the Kabuki Deluxe and Omkase Delux for starters."}
{"text":"Consistent, that's why I go here. Not the most appealing description but sometimes I'm just too tired to explore the area when traveling. It's within walking distance from my hotel and there is a movie theater and shopping at this outdoor center.  I have started off with the mango chi hi the last couple of times here and it is a very refreshing drink during the summer.   I ordered the tempura appetizer and was disappointed. One piece of shrimp and the vegetables were overdone. I also got the rose roll and Philly roll. I must say both were good, the fish was fresh and I had some nice leftovers.  Other than being seated in the corner by the hostess, the service was overall good. This is a place you could definitely come to when traveling by yourself."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in town or at least in the west Valley.  Eaten here numerous times never a long wait always curtious staff that are attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"I've been to the Kabuki at Westgate but this is the first time I've been to the Tempe one. I read a review here that said they have a vegan menu, and they did! I forgot to take a picture though, darn it. It was a little confusing because it combines gluten free with vegan. Once I found out the ginger dressing is vegan (just not gf) I was good to go.  I ordered the tofu steak - same as at Westgate. I was tempted by the spicy tofu with crispy rice, but there was no description on the menu and the server said it was a \"spicy mayo sauce.\" The tofu steak was delicious, but could have used more sauce. I added soy sauce to stretch it.  Service was outstanding! Just the right amount of check-ins and refills. I look forward to going again and trying the veggie ramen!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Kabuki's food. I normally eat at Chipotle or Which Wich before hockey games but had a little more time before this one and joined some friends who wanted to eat at Kabuki. It looked like they had at least a salad and inari that I could eat (I'm vegan).   The only negative: When I arrived, I asked the hostess if they had a vegan menu. They said \"no, but just ask your server what's vegan.\" Then when I asked the server, she pointed to the \"vegetarian\" icon on the menu and said that I should use that icon as my guide to what might be close to vegan - didn't offer to check with the chef on any items, etc. So, I was on my own.   The agedashi tofu had bonito (fish) flakes and wasn't marked vegetarian which made it a clear no-go. My friend pointed out the tofu steak, which was marked vegetarian. I went for that. It came with soup or salad. The miso soup isn't marked vegetarian, so it probably has seafood of some sort. The salad was typical - mostly iceberg - but the sesame ginger dressing was amazing. It was served on the side, but plentiful. I want more now! I crave it!  The server asked how well I wanted the tofu steak cooked. I'd never been asked that before! I was glad, because the tofu pieces were very thick. \"Well done\" was the right choice for me. The tofu was lightly crusted - probably with corn starch and shaped like two hockey pucks. The teriyaki sauce was delicious - a bit spicy with ginger maybe? I wanted more, as it only covered half of each tofu puck. It also came with a small on-plate salad, asparagus, little balls of rice (more would have been useful) and mushrooms, which I had them leave off. It was a lot of food! My friend ordered the same thing and loved hers as well!  My only concern is that since the server wasn't interested in helping me determine what was vegan, I wonder if anything I ate had animal ingredients? I'll have to do some research. If it was all vegan, I will be back for sure! I'll update what I learn here."}
{"text":"Travis was an amazing server. The food was phenomenal and overall it was a great experience . We walked in the restaurant half hour to an hour before closing and still got the full maxing service by Travis . I wish all servers were like him . Loved it and will def come back ."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Saturday night before Amy Schumer's show. It said 20 minutes waiting time and turned out to an hour.  The food was average, but our waiter Jared was very nice. My niece ordered chicken satay teriyaki it was undercooked, so she sent it back. She ordered the garlic edamame it was ok and she also ordered sweet potatoes fries and again it was undercooked.  I was a bit lucky that my udon seafood soup was good."}
{"text":"It was good and the complimentary Edamame was a nice touch.  It was a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Good food good service.  I come here for the grilled octopus and spicy tuna on chrispy rice, pretty good."}
{"text":"So good! Excellent rolls, amazing staff and great atmosphere. I'll be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town square. I've eaten here at least a dozen times and more. I just ate here and I feel so bad that I couldn't tip our server Jason more, he was great! Their food & staff are amazing. :)"}
{"text":"I have come here before and enjoy the casual ambiance of Kabuki. We came on a Tuesday evening and it wasn't very busy. We sat outside, which was nice as Tempe Marketplace has such a nice atmosphere. However, it was so slow to not only place our orders but to receive them as well. We kept receiving all of our food randomly. My drink did not come out until I was completely done eating my food. Although our waitress did apologize, it was only after we had to ask for her attention or get her to come to our table. She was constantly running around, and didn't seem very focused. I think the food here is good, the prices decent, but the service is rough."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot since their sushi and rolls are very fresh and delicious. The restaurant has a good vibe and it is very modern. I recommend this place to friends as the best sushi roll in town. The service has been outstanding at this place. However, I really was disappointed by its quality of food on my recent visit. Somehow the rolls were lacking the flavor(badly). I would easily give this place 4 stars since I had so many good experience but it was that disappointing yesterday. I might give them an another try if I happen to go to the mall there."}
{"text":"Very disappointed . A nice environment wasted and not represented well. Our 15min wait turned into 30 and that was just the beginning to a not so great experience.  I've had horrible service the last two visits I've made to this location. The service was extremely slow, and we were forgot about when sitting at the Sushi Bar. So my suggestion would be to sit at an actual table, so you're not disregarded.   The sushi was good but wouldn't say it was great for the money spent. A lil bland and the pieces were few. I've been to a good amount of sushi spots in the valley both 'commercial' and divey locations and this really missed the target all together on customer service and presentation.   I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best happy hours in town. Happy hour is Mon to Fri from 3PM-6PM, so I'm usually walking in at 5:45 rushing from work. The servers are nice and is ok with you ordering a couple minutes before 6PM. They also let you know when it is HH last call.   HH drinks include $2 beers and $2 sake  HH food starts at $3, but my favorite items are Salmon Nigiri ($3) for 2 large pieces, and Spicy Tuna roll ($4). It's a great snack after work and on the way to the movies.   The staff there are always pleasant but come time for the check, it takes them a while. If you are in a hurry, ask for the check early."}
{"text":"A group of girls and I went there last night just for drinks, so this is a review of the bar only.  Our drinks were great. the male bartender, Jimmy, was very helpful w/ our indecisiveness and very nice. The girl bartender that was working was much less than that. Someone would be asking her a question and she would walk away mid sentence to do something else at the bar.   Id go back, but avoid that bartender."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! Everything was good except for the ramen. I wish they didn't have to put all The sidings on top of the soup. I didn't like the sprout to be mixed in the soup. Server-Angie was Awesome. She made sure we got everything."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and astonishingly bad service, no water refills, sushi took forever, mediocre food, not reasonably priced.  If I didn't ask the waitress three times for my miso soup I would still be waiting and probably wouldn't have had until Tuesday afternoon.  By far the worst waitress I've ever had.  The sushi bar was so slow and not entertaining in the least.  The only saving grace was this other waitress sunny who was friendly, cute and  attempting to make up for way lost time.  If it wasn't for her, it would be an absolute no on giving this place a go.  I waited so long for my sushi you would think they fetched it out of the sea right after I ordered it."}
{"text":"Felt like the foods taste better than last couple times I visited. It was a busy night I guess the crowd got tired of waiting for the bbq next door so they decided to dine here. Ordered Uni pasta, Sunkissed rolls, and Spider rolls. Everything were great!"}
{"text":"I love Kabuki. The food is consistantly good. The service has always been awesome. I took a family member who isn't even a fan of the type of food served at Kabuki and even she left happy."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Service was friendly. The restaurant itself has a welcoming aura and the music is not overwhelming and rather soothing. The food came out in a timely fashion but we did go in early around opening time. They take open table reservation on the site. Another plus side is they do substitute white rice for brown rice!;-)"}
{"text":"The consierge at the Tropicana recommended Kabuki's and it was great!  Can't beat the Happy Hour prices.  Sushi and tofu salad were delicious, and our server was very good."}
{"text":"Just Order a fish in four $21 this portion it's a joke!!!  They put more rice than the actual fish. I was very disappointment this time even after talk to the manager they still say this is the portion."}
{"text":"Sushi was good as was the sashimi. They have excellent sauces with the rolls. I recommend the  Lotus on Fire roll for thos that enjoy flavor and spicy. The G.O. wild roll and the Sunkiss rolls were also great as was the Hamachi Sake box. The fish was not the best I've had but definitely was excellent. Service was solid and the ambiance was what you would expect from a sushi place at a prominant location. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Spicy Seafood Pasta, yummy but spicy for me. Try it, you'll love this place. all fish served fresh than any other place. Manager is friendly and humble."}
{"text":"Love this place, great sushi, no teppanyaki. Good service and a nice selection of saki and beers. Expensive but you get what you pay for. Highly recommend you try this place.   Gets busynon the weekends but theynalso have seating at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"After new management for this franchise, they have definitely decreased the portions and changed the menu for the worse.....not better.  Large sashimi platter looks like a \"small\".  Never coming back!!  A waste of money!!"}
{"text":"First Off, I have only gone there for happy hour during Mon-Fri.  No Weekends.  However, I am a frequent Sushi eater, and not just because it's trendy...  I do like Kabuki because of it's pricing, the rolls are usually ok, not the best, but certainly good for the money.  We usually do not drink there, but their drink menu is very cheap.  However, EVERY time I have gone there, it's pretty much dead, and the service has SERIOUSLY been lacking.  I always go with the same friend, we always order the same things, most of the time it's between the same 3 waiters.  Its ALWAYS slow.  They ALWAYS forget at least one thing we ordered.  It always take WAY longer than any other Sushi place we go to (even when those other places are slammed).  The only reason I finally decided to write a review was that I ordered a couple new things this last time, and they were completely unacceptable.  We ordered 4 different types of Rolls, and two types of Sashimi.  The rolls were sticky and tasted not very fresh, the avocado on one was turning brown.  The Sashimi was left off of our order until we asked for it 2 times, then it came out oviously old, sticky, and smelly.  Unedible.  We had to ask for Wasabe which has always been included before, and when it came out it was obviously old and dry as well.  My main upset was about the Tempura Mozzarella we ordered which was a first.  It was unedible as well.  The first bite was great, but it was STUFFED with Jalapeno STEMS.  Not pieces of the peppers (which I would have picked out anyways bc it just didn't suit the tempura AT ALL) but woody, extremly spicy STEMS.  DISGUSTING.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  Too many failed attempts.  Above all, THERE US NO EXCUSE FOR THE THOROUGHLY SHI**Y SERVICE.  NO excuse."}
{"text":"Not that great Over rated. Expensive. Only upside is their fried ice cream I wanted a spicy tuna roll without smelt eggs and was told they couldn't take them out because they're pre made rolls So that was a bummer My boyfriend likes it  But to me it's alright I guess"}
{"text":"Love the environment. And yep the spicy tuna roll rocks."}
{"text":"Awesome bathroom,  going to it has a bent hallway and when you get in the restroom the room is all twisted and bent too... neat."}
{"text":"I will be back! The bbq beef ribs were awesome! Aso had the avocado roll (was literally avocado rolled up... could use some kind of twist imo) shishito peppers (delish...not spicy) koshou beef (very different flavor- antique is the word thzt comes to mind lol- though it makes no sense). Now waiting on coffee and dessert to get here..."}
{"text":"Customer service is poor. Very slow waited for 15 minutes before someone took our order and 40 minutes for our food. The hosts was not nice and the waiter was extremely cold."}
{"text":"After having an absolutely horrible experience at a revolving sushi place (we were attempting to save money), we came back here to eat the other day. Everything tasted amazing, the nigiri was especially fresh. We would come every day and try new things often if it wasn't so pricy."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now and was quite impressed. Not only do they have a nice atmosphere (plus patio) for dining, but quality sushi.  Their sashimi cuts are nice and generous which is something that really stands out to me. Rainbow roll was superb and Philly was delish also. NOTE: I'd prefer mine w/a little less cream cheese, as it starts to overpower the salmon.  I've dined at the Kabuki in Woodland Hills, CA also and had an impressive experience.  Great job Kabuki - you have won me over!"}
{"text":"Came here for a girls' night out and had a great time. I really enjoyed the California roll. The Sunkissed roll was super spicy and very yummy. Enjoyed a large Sapporo and the edamame. Would come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour...They have a decent beer selection.  I'm pretty sure you can only get hot sake.   We had a california roll, shrimp tempura roll and a spicy tuna app off of the happy hour menu.  Both rolls were really fresh and tasty.  I can't remember the exact name of the spicy tuna app...It tasted good but kind of difficult to eat with the egg roll crisps it comes with. I had the creamy peach saketini....I would highly recommend it!  Very smooth and delicious.  One of those \"dangerously good\" drinks!  My husband had the sangria and didn't care for it. We sat in the bar in the booths.  The bartender is also the waitress for the entire bar.  She was helpful and checked on us pretty frequently. We've been there a couple times now and have always enjoyed ourselves.  It's a nice place to have dinner if you're planning on going to other places in Town Square."}
{"text":"This place looks good on the cover but comes up way short.  I liked the menu and the photo menu - but the sushi wasn't fresh.  Everything came out all pretty but tasted bad.  Upon further review, most of the rolls are california rolls with stuff on them.   I ordered 4 pieces of eel that were chewy.  They put WAY too much rice on each sushi piece and the rice was undercooked or something.  NOTHING we ate melted in your mouth like a good piece of sushi or a roll should do.  We ordered 5 rolls and an assortment of sushi and soups.  The mushroom soup that was $3 more than the normal miso soup had maybe 8 small mushroom fragments in it.  The chopsticks they give you are the cheap grocery store kind with splinters.  Too bad the sushi wasn't as good as you can get from some grocery stores... yes it was that bad - I'm never going back here again."}
{"text":"Being with work friends, we decided after a drink at Town Square to grab a bite. Kabuki was everyone's choice.  Inside is simple, modern and clean.  Cocktails ordered from the full bar, a variety of appetizers and sushi was requested.  Everything was very good. Service was awesome. I think my hubby went back the following day he was so in love with the sushi and rice dish he'd ordered the night before."}
{"text":"Me and my cousin came here to meet up with his friend while we take our orders and enjoy the scenery from the inside and out the patio. First time here and had free sake samples. The manager was kind enough to give me their shot glass set since i insisted on paying for two different sets. Guess that means i'm kinda annoying to them but greatful with the service. If ever i would come back to vegas again this would be my first stop before heading to my reserved hotel. Food was awesome by the way."}
{"text":"Warning:  I'm not a sushi guy, so this review is based only on food of the cooked variety, though, from what I heard from everyone else in the group who was enjoying the more raw variety, the sushi and sashimi comes in a wide selection and plentiful quantity.  I started off with a Kirin, which is a good way to kick off any Japanese-ish meal, in my opinion.  I ordered the Beef Teriyaki, which comes with a very tasty miso, a bowl of rice and a rather mediocre salad.  The teriyaki was very well prepared, the meat cooked just right and the sauce tasty without being overpowering.     Also, the prices here are pretty reasonable.  I think the meal was in the $13 neighborhood and the 22oz. beer was $7.  Along with the huge list of sushi choices, they also had a nice selection of cooked seafood, as well. So, there's a little something for everyone.  I'm proof of that."}
{"text":"Awesome food and good service.... Drove all the way down to have seabass, and its sold out"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the service, food, and vibe of this restaurant. My girlfriends and I come here for dinner a few times a year. This experience was a little off as all of our entrees came out at different times. We had to ask twice for one of them. This is usually the case so we will be back but it was a little off for sure."}
{"text":"I thought \"Corporate Sushi\" no fucking way!! I have been a fan of Blue Wasabi and RA was a go to for me. I love Sashimi and eat it about twice a month. So my friend and I decided to try Kabuki as an option to the latter. When we walked in my first impression was this place was alot more open, brighter and better decorated than RA and BW. It had no smell which is a great sign.   I went out of my usual realm of Hamachi Sashimi and Uni. I actually ordered an entree for the first time at a sushi joint. I want to tell you that what I had was a 5 star dish. I am a Sucker for chilean sea bass. It's buttery, flaky, holds flavor well and tastes absolutely deliciuos. This place did not fail to impress. I loved the freshness. It was cooked PERFECT and the sauce was out of this world. One of the best Sea Bass dishes I have ever had and I have eaten this dish all over the country! If you love Chilean Sea Bass do not pass this up. It is my guarentee you will be shocked that a corporation could create such a flavourfull dish!!"}
{"text":"Great location,  Best meal in whole Las Vegas, we came here during happy hour and got a nice price reduction. Definitely a recommendation for people who like Sushi and Japanese, it's really tasty and one of the better sushi's I had so far.  Should go over!"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite sushi joints in Vegas. I don't really have any dislikes at this point. Every time I'm here they always do an excellent job with the service and order. The food always arrives in good time and is always accurate and tastes the way sushi should. This is my favorite Kabuki location and I'm beyond pleased and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been here over 20 times in the last 5 years and I gotta say that the service has gone down hill.  I came here with some friends for dinner Saturday night and ordered salmon with teriyaki sauce on the side and avocado rolls with brown rice instead of white. Only 2 modifications. Not too complicated right???  Yes! It was complicated. I got my rolls with white rice instead of white so the waitress ended up taking it back and we had to wait another 10 minutes.  Then my salmon came slathered in teriyaki sauce and it looked like they added more when I clearly stated sauce on the side.  What made this more frustrating is that every time the waitress came she kept saying 'I told the kitchen, but they messed up'.   My question is that you are the one taking the order and should be looking at the dish before you bring it out to your table. That is the correct way of handling things... not complaining to your table that it's not your fault.   Please take responsibility for your part in servicing your table. I've worked in the food industry before and this is just unacceptable.   Long story short I probably will not make my way back here again. Not only because of this poor experience, but because the other location at Tivoli Village has also dropped the ball.  I know for a fact I can find a better Sushi place in Vegas. This use to be my favorite Sushi joint, but not any more... so disappointing."}
{"text":"First time going here...I love it!!! They have Reverse Happy Hour!!!! I'd go back again!!! =)"}
{"text":"I'm a local of Las Vegas. Been here several times, this place is real hyped up for what it's actually worth. Super mediocre customer service, cheap chop sticks, slow service, funny atmosphere scent, tables/ customer seating is crammed for more business, prices are whatever I guess."}
{"text":"Although I've lived here for two years I never visited this place for sushi.  It was actually surprisingly OK.  I had this tuna and jalapeno on fried rice, crab legs and tuna poke.  What really made this stand-out today was Joseph.  I am 90% sure that was his name... definitely started with a J and he looked to be amer-asian.  Anyways he was OUTSTANDING.  He really paid attention to all the little things, made recommendations, worried even about the fish roe having wasabi in it for the kids, brought refills promptly, and asked the chef to make sure my crab legs were not to buttery or oily.  He is probably the best server I have had in Las Vegas which is saying a lot in a town that specializes in hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We were seated right away.  Everything on the menu looked incredible.  I had the mozzarella wontons and two different veggie rolls.  I thought I was going to have way too much food but it was perfect.  My husband had two rolls that were also delicious.  The restroom was very nice and clean which is always a good thing.  Also, I love Town Square and try to do a little shopping there whenever we are in Vegas and Kabuki is the perfect place to show up hungry and leave happy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Arizona. If you want good sushi you need to check it out!!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place! Their alaskan roll is THE best roll I have ever tasted. You know you're a regular when the chefs already know what you wanna get! Haha. Customer service is fast and great. Highly recommend this place, I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent I am not a fan of sushi but it was good quality food and great atmosphere so I would definitely recommend for those sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Great sushi .they have happy hours too.-nice atmosphere -lounge type. Mai thai is excellent"}
{"text":"We love hanging out in Tivoli Village and have been wanting to try this place. We made reservations on Open Table and revived a confirmation, but arrived to find no reservations. The girl did not believe me until I showed her the email. Not so bad as there were plenty of tables open. Not a good sign for 8pm on a Saturday night. Soon as we were seated, our server was on it. He recommended the Bloody Yoko, we asked for extra spicy. The Bloody's were weak, very tomatoey and if there was vodka, must have been a thimble full. Also, the celery stalk was OLD, soft and rubbery. This was a lousy Bloody Mary. We then ordered appetizers. We tried the Grilled Calamari, the Garlic Edamame and Pot Stickers. The Calamari was tasty as were the Garlic Edamame. The Pot Stickers were meh. For mains I tried the Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta, this was really very good. Looked and tasted great. Wifey had the Garlic Beef Yaki. This was the hit of our dinner, great. Our friend tried the Lobster Dynamite and loved every bite. Overall I'd say it was a solid 3 star experience. The attitude from the Hostess and the lousy cocktails kinda killed it for us. Pity. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I've been here a few times and every time, the food and service have been consistently good! Thanks kabuki!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, the hat Sake and the tasty sashimi!  This place is my go to for sushi and fun."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a relatively quiet Saturday afternoon. Not the first time I have eaten here, but usually I sit inside because of the heat in the Marketplace. We decided to take a seat out on the patio for a bite in the sun.  We immediately ordered drinks and began to check out the menu. A group of young ladies sat down across from us, I merely mention them because  they were my measurement for the timeliness of our service. As we waited behind them for most of our mean.   Our drinks were delayed with the bartender being out for the day, and the manager playing catchup to cover. Which is understandeable, except these ladies received theirs about ten minutes before we did. We were all very satisfied with the product we were receiving, but disappointed in the fact that we were watching food go by to tables that had seated and ordered after us. I'm not sure what to attribute this to, but it certainly affected the meal.  Great food overshadowed by some very long wait time. Will definitely consider it again, but will return to inside seating."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I thought I hadn't been to this place before but when I entered, it felt familiar and realized I had come here a few years ago. I came here for dinner with a friend and we opted to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.  There was 15 minutes left for happy hour and we took advantage of it. We decided to order calamari rings as our appetizer and my friend got a mint lemonade. Initially it didn't taste like mint but when she got a refill it did. The rings were okay; I liked that they were on a bed of greens and came with a sweet and sour type sauce. For our main dishes, we ordered the Las Vegas rolls, the Philly roll and the California roll. I'm not a fan of fried rolls but the LV wasn't bad, my favorite is always the Philly or any that has cream cheese in it. When I asked for Sriracha, our waiter also offered spicy mayo which was a nice addition. It was nice that they didn't charge extra for them and it was nice to have a choice of them.   Service was consistent and friendly and the food was worth the money. I'm not sure if it would be my first choice for sushi but I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Me and a group of people came for our sadies and the service was so so pleasant. Our hostess Kalee sat us right away which we were thankful for, now if she was probably our server we would have liked it more. We found ourselves waiting for refills of water most of the time and I vegas we need water. Kaylee was the perk"}
{"text":"Place wasn't what we expected. There are such an abundant amount of sushi restaurants in vegas that blow this one away. Reconsider if you want to try the place."}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food here. We come all the time for happy hour but this last time we enjoyed the service more than usual. Our server by the name of Huy, was awesome! From the beginning very informative (every time we go we try something new) other times we get the \"it's really good\" response but he knew the menu very well and answered our questions. What was great about him was that after he learned about our recent engagement he brought out a little"}
{"text":"CONSISTENTLY good quality sushi, CONSISTENTLY good service.  This is a great location and I've been to other several other Kabuki locations and have never had a bad experience.  Not expensive but not cheap AYCE sushi drenched in sauces to mask the freshness of the fish.  Even the \"high end\" sushi joints overuse sauces.  The point of eating sushi is to taste the freshness and texture of the fish.  It seems Kabuki takes Quality control seriously.  After dozens of visits through the years I decided to give them the props they deserve."}
{"text":"Loved it the first time.   Cozy ambiance, prompt service, great food...but inconsistent...  The Mediterranean Sea Bass is divine! Started with the sides served with the dish. I have never tasted such delightful corn kernels & asparagus, that makes my tastebuds dance in ecstasy! I wish I wrote this review much a week earlier when all was still fresh in my memory. The sea bass was cooked to perfection, full of flavor & the tomato salsa mix truly makes this dish intoxicating!  Now here's where I go off the beaten path, which makes me hesitant to award 4stars. The Lotus on Fire roll was inconsistent...  Returned a week later for a light meal, which consisted of the Lotus on Fire roll. It lack the rich flavor it had the first time it touched my palate. The rice was more prominent this round, the sauce was disappointingly bland, the only thing I could taste & in succession was rice, then the heat of the jalapeno pepper.   I frequent TS every weekend, I hope to rectify this review with a third visit."}
{"text":"Kabuki Kabuki, I've been here once before when it first opened for happy hour but I haven't been back since. No good reason why I haven't been back, but we finally came back with a gift card (a very thoughtful wedding present since we are Japanese food lovers!). We sat at the sushi bar and it was busy for a cold winter Wednesday. Happy hour had just ended so we were seated right away. We started ordering right away and the timing of each roll/entree came out was perfect. I had ordered the tempura udon and it was pretty tasty with a good portion size. Overall, service was attentive, food was good and we will be back."}
{"text":"Excelente atención por los meseros y la comida deliciosa , precios muy buenos , en mi próxima visita a las Vegas volveré aquí"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a true review for this place as I have only been there for the grand opening.  I'm not sure if the free food buffet they had was a true sample of their menu or not.  I was impressed by the variety of food they had available, most notably the Teriyaki beef which is among the best I have ever tasted.  Growing up in Hawaii this is no small feat... I used to live off of the stuff.  They also had some interesting drinks available at the bar, including a sparkling sake beer (that is the only way I can think to describe it) that was quite addicting."}
{"text":"I order from Kabuki about once a week (through doordash delivery) and the sushi is always great.  The salads, chicken teriyaki and pork katsu dishes are awesome too."}
{"text":"Food: 1. clean, decent quantity, variety  Taste: 1. good enough  Service: 1. good service 2. forgot to provide wasabi for table, come on!  Overall: I know of no sushi place except this one which forgets wasabi and ginger for its guests."}
{"text":"Garlic edamame is tasty! Also had the salmon lunch entree and that was cooked well with great flavors. The staff was a little on the lazy side when we were there maybe it being early and not so busy. They found time to stand around and talk instead of check on us, but otherwise the food was fresh and speedy."}
{"text":"happy hour there is the best! check in for a free spicy tuna roll"}
{"text":"Now I'm no Daniel LaRusso with a chopstick, but I have never had so many pieces of sushi crumble when I tried to eat them.  I have only been too a handful of sushi places, but his has to be my least favorite of them all.    Maybe it's because someone decided to order for the whole table and I wasn't able to get what I wanted or the fact that everything that came seemed thrown together what ever it was I didn't have a good experience here."}
{"text":"The first time my friend brought me there..i try their kabuki deluxe, hibachi rice, spicy seafood udon pasta.. Like it a lot.. Yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a friend. The place wasn't busy at all so I assumed service would be quick and it was. Got my drink order quick. Our food was delivered in a timely manner. The rolls were yummy. No complains here. Thanks for the great lunch experience:]"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with couple colleagues, and the food was good. The service was good, I would say it's great, if our server was more personable. It's a nice place if you wanted sushi for a quick bite or want to have a variety of food selection. They do have a really big menu for food which is a plus!  I do recommend trying their beef appetizer."}
{"text":"It is very nice that happy hour menu offer in the entire restaurant. You don't have worry about cramming into a tiny bar or lounge space  we were seat at nice table just like any other dinner Love the food and service very original menu with slots of options aside from the typical sushi"}
{"text":"So the first time that I ate here, around the time that they opened, had I done a review then, I would've given this place a whopping 1, if I was feeling nice that day, 2-Stars... But on my recent visit, during Happy Hour, I'm going to give it a blazing 4-Stars.   Ok, I agree with everyone, the quality of the sushi is not high grade, but it's not gawd-awful. It did it's job for Happy Hour and I think that would be the ONLY time that I'd come here. Although they limit as to what is on their HH menu, there is a pretty nice selection and I was pretty happy with what I had. I had about 4 or 5 (?) Lychee drinks (alcoholic beverages that I can't remember for the life of me what they call them) and about 2-3 spicy tunas @ $2.50 or $3 each,... Man, I should try to stay sober so I can write these reviews accurately! Wth...   Anyway, this is a great place for HH if you're looking to get some kinda sushi fix. As far as their full priced menu, ahhh, I wouldn't. Unfortunately, I'd say steer clear for that... Just come for happy hour."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was awful. There were easily 8 servers on the floor, and I could not get anyone to stop long enough to refill my drink."}
{"text":"Pretty good altogether. It is my second favorite Sushi Bar in Las Vegas behind Narita in the Northwest. Environment is easily a 5. I really like unagi but the way they cook it with the skin on it made it a little less appetizing. The portions were good size and I went away full."}
{"text":"Ok so we went here on a saturday night and it was fairly busy everywhere at Westgate. When we walked in we were greated and told it would be a 20 min. wait, fine by me seeing that this place was packed. 45 minutes later after complaining to the hostess that she had her timing off, she explained to me why everyone was getting seated before me. She said there is no wait to sit at the sushi bar, well thanks for letting me know when I walked in lady. I honestly think we were the last people to sit down for the night out of the 12 groups that came in before or after us, mostly after. So then we sat and waited 5 minutes for our waiter to come to our table, ordered a round of beers and It took over ten minutes for him to come back, then he explained that they had to change out the tap, once again they should have told me this in half the time. So we ordered a bunch of sushi, a big mix and it was quite enjoyable but not the best ever. Halfway through our meal we ordered another round, it took 8 minutes, maybe they changed the tap faster that time. After noticing that we were frustrated with the amount of time we have spent there waiting to be seated, get food, and our drinks the waiter backed off and was more interested in other tables than seeing if we needed anything. So then we asked the manager if we could tab out because we are ready to go. Within two minutes the waiter is at our table asking if we need anything and that he really appreciates that we stopped in, and that he is sorry for being so busy.  So you were chewed out and now your trying to save your tip great, lucky we give 20% everytime no matter what because I wanted to give nothing, and almost broke my rule.  So key pointers here; Good sushi, bad hostesses wo care more about gossip tha being honest about your wait time or explaining the restaurant, Understaffed, Overcrowded with a loud younger crowd (not the place you would go for a peacefull night out) and Lacking service. I am going to give it another try in the next few days and update my review on if it changed at all. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I'm no Sushi expert, and far from being a master of Japanese food. But this place seems good to me. Great environment, good vibe inside and busy commerce below make it a fun place. The food has always been terrific, just a little over priced in my opinion. We've been there a few times, and the sushi always seems fresh, well presented, and a very good balance of flavors in each roll. Great place to eat and splurge a little if you are going around the Westgate area for a game, concert, or the piano bar down the way.   I would have given them 4 stars had the service been a little quicker and a little friendly. Maybe the five times I've been there, they were just having bad nights...but it was a little like my sushi order was being taken by someone moonlighting from the local waffle house."}
{"text":"I came into Kabuki with my family for lunch. Everything started off great and the server was pleasant. We were waiting on our last roll which took longer than expected. Our last roll was dropped off twice and both times it wasn't made the way we asked for it to be made. Our server seemed more apologetic and concerned than the manager was. It was not a good customer service experience. It was first time dining at Kabuki and it'll be our last time there."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great , food is good , staff is professional and nice . I dig this place"}
{"text":"Tough to find location. Glad I persevered as I sat at the bar and enjoyed the food and drinks. Bartender was friendly and had good knowledge of the menu. One suggestion if you place a table ad for a new dessert on the counter it should be available. Not told that it would be available in another day or 2."}
{"text":"Food came out fast, service was attentive and kind. The menu is very expansive with lots of varying rolls, not just the usual add-ons over California roll. Awesome appetizers and great sushi roll combinations. We ate some of the stranger rolls, but being veteran sushi eaters the standards held up well to our expectations. It is on the expensive side, but to me you are paying for all the options as well as location. Great date night location."}
{"text":"I enjoy their happy hour tons but hardly ever eat her for a regular meal because of their frequent dining club card offers are just a joke. They used to do awesome things for birthdays and anniversaries but now it seems like the Red Mask card is a huge joke. Stick to the sushi and the sake bombs and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Kabuki does not serve unforgettable food, but it's convenient and good enough to come back now and then. Their Dynamite, Vegas, and Alaskan rolls are my favorite. I would stay away from the the Lobster and Rose roll- bland and does not look appealing. I like my sushi with some kind of presentation. Don't forget to order dessert! I always get the green tea tempura ice cream, which is scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"this is my favorite place to go for happy hour! i love thier tokyo mojito too"}
{"text":"Call me old fashioned, but I don't like to be rushed when I specifically go out to eat dinner. This was boyfriend and I first time going to kabuki and I was really excited we never get a chance to go out together and just enjoy the night since we both work evenings. We got there around 6 and the host seated us quickly. Our server came over at least 3 times within 2 minutes of us sitting down to take our drink order which made me feel rushed, and even awkward at that point. She didn't want to add suggestions just wanted our order and scoffed off when we weren't ready. This continued throughout the night she'd come over every few minutes to ask us if we're ready to order. I think we just decided on two rolls because it was so rushed and we hardly had a chance to look over the whole menu. Once we got our food it wasn't impressive. They try to do fun things with the rolls but frankly the food was nasty. The roll was falling apart as soon as it hit the table. And the eel was soggy and just tasted like it was out for hours. For such a \"fancy\" looking place I wasn't impressed. I don't recommend this location it seems like they're trying to be sushi McDonald's and not a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"And now, the long awaited Kabuki update... to be fair, this update is a combination of several mishaps and events... they all are related to each other, and therefore I felt they needed to be reviewed together.   As I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).  Everyone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.  It all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.  I left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.  Kabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.  This past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there.   We started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were.   We both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.  In the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).  There are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service."}
{"text":"I go here often for happy hour and I always leave feeling satisfied. I used to work at an upscale Japanese and Thai restaurant on the east coast with super fresh seafood and this is the closest in quality and service I've found since I moved to AZ. The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone- both sushi and meat lovers. I love that there is Louis martini Cab on the menu and that they featured rock shrimp on a sushi roll. I also really appreciate the little bowl of edamame you get complementary when you sit down. I can't finish this post without saying that the fried ice cream is a must try. With three flavors of ice cream (vanilla, green tea, and coffee) you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has 3.5 stars. My buddy and I had four specialty rolls and each were excellent. I'd give this place a 4.5 and go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I already gave the Westgate one 5 stars, and this one gets no less. Again, just quite simply the best sushi for your dollar in the entire valley."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is always completely packed. My bf and I have considered Kabuki our favorite AZ restaurant since we moved here.  For the 1st-Timer:  -salmon sushi w/ ponzu (NOT soy sauce)  -albacore crunch roll (garlic chips, red onion, ponzu broth) -lotus roll (cali roll topped w/ hot lobster, eel sauce, tobiko) -lychee martini   And then once you've experienced those your 1st time, you can move to other parts of the menu including the spicy miso ramen, cha shu ramen, sunkissed roll, oyster shooters, and spicy seafood udon."}
{"text":"Japanese Restaurant located inside of Town Square.  The restaurant has a dining area, sushi bar, and sake bar. The menu had some good signature cocktails like a sake mule and sake sangria.  The sushi rolls were fresh and delicious. I particularly liked the scallop roll.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"The reviews for Kabuki just doesn't do it justice!! A friend of mine told me they've undergone new ownership recently! NO WONDER!!! She admits it really wasnt good before but trust me guys..  it's definitely the go to place for sushi off the strip.  I've had a fair share of sushi and everywhere I go it's good.. but this place was REALLY good. The place itself it very beautiful and ritzy looking.. you would expect the prices to be really expensive but they're not at all. It was the three of us and it cost 55 bucks for a miso soup, 3 rolls, scallop appetizer, a sashimi sampler, and some cokes. Not too shabby!  our appetizer, the Crispy Scallop Arare ($9) was soooo good! They were dice-sized pieces of scallop lightly battered and fried with rice crackers.. and the best part was the spicy mayo to dip in. and get this, the spicy mayo.. was actually spicy. thank you kabuki.   the sashimi plate ($9 wow) was also a big hit at my table. my faves were the shrimp, tuna, and yellowtail. fresh!!   the rolls we got were the Spider Roll ($10), the Shrimp Tempura Roll($8), and the Sunkissed roll ($10)... they were all good. not too much rice, not shady on the sashimi, no imitation crab. yayy.   If you're unsure of what to get.. get the items that has a red icon next to them. Those items are \"Chef Recommended\". Most of our items had this symbol!   Oh yeah, consider coming here during the day. It's in the Town Square Shopping Center where there are lots of stores to shop like H&M, ...-- I cant think of anything else because all i wanted was to go there. But there were others I swear.."}
{"text":"Came in here with a party of 8 for happy hour, Travis was our server.  We had a hard time ordering but yet our server was still smiling, patient and VERY accommodating to our party. I appreciate him for his service!!! Thank you TRAVIS!"}
{"text":"We have been in Phoenix for a week eating out and I told my husband that this was the best food we have had all week. He answered by saying it was the best food he has ever eaten at a restaurant anywhere!!  We are from the Sacramento area up in the foothills. We have eaten all over the world. This is by far the best overall. Not just Japanese food alone, but any  kind, anywhere!   When we return, we will not miss eating here again. Kudos to everyone from the moment we entered and left with big smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"I randomly ended up here the other night with a friend to get our sushi fix (you sushi junkies know how serious those withdrawals are).  I ordered the Sunkissed Roll and it was pretty good.  I really like that the Edamame is free with your food instead of being $2 or some other measly charge that's more of an annoyance than anything just because you have to physically order it.  So that was a plus.  Service was very good also.  Our waitress was constantly checking with us to make sure our water was filled and see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"I was meeting up with a friend and we felt like sushi so we decided to stop in here.  I've been to the one in Tempe Marketplace so I pretty much knew what to expect food wise.  Service however was not very good.  It was a Tuesday afternoon and it wasn't especially busy but there was only one server for the whole restaurant.  I don't know who's staffing decision that was, but it was wrong.  We waited for about 5 minutes to be seated, not terrible but it would have been nice if there was a host/hostess waiting by the door to seat us right away.  Once we were seated out waitress showed up a little bit later to bring us water.  We gave her our drink order at that point as well.  It took probably about 10 minutes for her to bring my drink, not my dates, and as she was dropping off my drink we asked if we could give her our food order as we had filled out the sheet already, she said that she would come back to get it.  Another 5 minutes and she finally brings the other drink and takes our food order.  The rest of the meal went pretty much the same way, it would take about 15 minutes for everything we needed her for, including water refills, the check, etc.  The food was good, as expected, but due to the service I would only come back if I wasn't really hungry and in a rush."}
{"text":"My experience here was reverse happy hour on Sunday(8-10pm). We ordered gold rush roll(California deep fried w/eel sauce), rose roll(tempura shrimp, avocado, spicy tuna), baked mussels, tempura veggies(sweet potato-not yam, carrot, zucchini, green beans, and 1 shrimp), crab salad( mixed greens, cucumber, gobo-Japanese carrot, avocado, HUGE scoop of crab mix). Sapporo draft beer(12oz), tuna poke(NOT on happy hour) was decent, big chunks tuna, avocado, and seaweed.  Everything was pretty good and fresh, nothing totally amazing though. Because we only ordered off the happy hour menu, we didn't have the chance to try the regular menu. However, for what we had ordered it was good, and priced decently for happy hour.  Our server Kira was the nicest server, i tried to see if there were a Yelp discount but he never heard of it but did try to give us mall discount. I would come back for Happy Hour. See photos i posted of items listed."}
{"text":"First time trying Japanese cuisine. Very fast service. Very delicious. Our waiter,Huy, was very kind! He recommended some very delicious Sushi! Asked for him he's funny too!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time and sat at the sushi bar, we constantly had servers reaching over us to pick up sushi orders for other guest which was very annoying. then one of the servers poured soy sauce all over my wife and I. All we got was I am sorry, didn't seem to even care so this must happen a lot...wont be back.."}
{"text":"i ordered the Salmon and Shrimp tempura combo and it was yummy. The skin of the salmon was crispy and the shrimps and veggies were tender. The peach margarita was watery...i should have just ordered green tea..."}
{"text":"Came in over the weekend for a late lunch & we got seated right away.  I tried the king crab salad which was delicious as well as the Hawaiian Roll which was also great.  My friend ordered one of the combos which came with A LOT of food for about $16 & looked great.  I would definitely come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the bomb (3-6) very good food & staff were awesome."}
{"text":"I've eaten here tons of times service is always great and food is even better my favorite is spicy tuna tempera  roll and for an entree the garlic beef yaki. I usually opt to sit at the sushi bar (the chefs are good and always make sure you have everything u need even if the have to holler to your server u need something ) I've had great service at the tables too. From the host to waiters to chefs everyone is professional accommodating and all about the guest"}
{"text":"Pretty good. My opinion on Kabuki is much like with Hachi over at Red Rock Station. Somewhat Americanized Japanese food but still tastes delicious. The lunch set items were pretty big. It comes with soup, salad, and mixed tempura depending on which lunch combo you order, and then the main entree. When I came in there with my family we brought a coupon with us that states \"buy one lunch combo and get a complimentary one.\" By the time we paid, the waitress forgot about the coupon but she fixed it by making TWO of the lunches complimentary. We all thought that was very nice. We also got two appetizers. The crowd favorite was their calamari. The two sauces that comes with it are very addicting. One is somewhat spicy and the other is pretty sweet. I'll probably come back just for their calamari haha. The venue is located at Tivoli Village which is kind of a hassle for me. I don't think Tivoli's location is as convenient as, say, Boca Park or even the one at Town Square. Overall, my family and I had a good experience and if not for the location we probably would frequent Kabuki more often."}
{"text":"This is a great place to experience Japanese cuisine. Location is convenient and serves is right on. Great for family occasions or just intimate dining for two. Every time I ago I leave that place with smile."}
{"text":"My visit started off shaky. Asked the hostess to move me, because earlier server was too busy. Then we were moved to Sam's section. I am so glad,because she is an awesome waitress! Ordered  he baja roll & garlic edamame. The food had a lot of great tasting favors! Even the ginger tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"I came here for a work lunch and loved it. We arrived around 11:30 and didn't have to wait for a table. I was overwhelmed with how many tasty options are on the menu. This is a great spot for people that love sushi or people that prefer standard options like chicken teriyaki.    We started with the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice. The taste was outstanding. I love the blend of the spicy tuna and jalapeno with slightly sweet, crispy rice. It was stacked high which made it hard to eat, but the taste trumped. the difficulty in eating.   For my entree I had Kabuki Deluxe Lunch special. This is basically a combination of awesome. It starts with a soup that is forgettable, but everything that comes after is delicious. The entree included beef ribs, chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, California roll, and tempura vegetables. There is no shortage of food with this combination. Everything on the plate was great. I'm torn between declaring the tempura vegetables or the beef ribs my favorite.   This is definitely going on my list of regular lunch spots. I know where I'll ask to go for my next work lunch."}
{"text":"They are pretty good for sushi.  Most of the rolls are too American for my style. The cilantro albacore roll is very good.  The sashimi platter and the chirachi are very good and I love their raw scallops.  This is the way to go in my opinion.  The goyza are just ok.  The cucumber salad is great.  I just wish they had special sushi daily like other sushi restaurants. I miss things like tobiko, white Tuna, chu toro,  and surf clam when I am here which with the too American rolls is the reason for 3 stars"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Great food and service is exceptional. Have been here several times and never disappointed. The spicy miso ramen is amazing!! They have a decent happy hour too.  Another location up in Summerlin."}
{"text":"On a family outing with cousins and aunts this restaurant was the perfect choice. I ordered the Grilled Shrimp Roll and it was more delicious than it sounded; soy sauce in a concentric line on the plate and orange sauce on the shrimp on top of the sushi rolls. The shopping center of my hometown really has evolved into a utopia of amazing delicacies from both generic chain and original. Anyone who shops at Westgate and desires Japanese cuisine I would recommend Kabuki."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal. Shen the manager never disappoints and always says hi when me or my family come in. You can't beat the quality of the dishes served. I would most definitely consider Kabuki high end sushi. It's one of the only sushi bars in town that I can enjoy fresh Uni (sea urchin) and hamachi toro (fatty yellow-tail). The culinary expertise of the chefs is breath-taking. There is a seasonal menu of new tastes and flavors that will wake up any pallet. The staff is gracious and serve to please. Whether you are at the sushi bar, cocktail bar or table/booth, the service is the best. Depending on the time you go, there could be a wait; however, don't be detoured as this is a must try!"}
{"text":"I went to Kabul when it was relatively slow. I ordered a pokebowl, and a long island. It's was a great experience. They bring you soup while you are waiting.  Extremely high quality food. I assumed it would have 5 stars. Idk why it doesn't have 6, shit."}
{"text":"I usually eat at Kabuki twice a month, I have their red mask club card and been happy with Kabuki overall until now. My 16 year old daughter decided she wanted to celebrate her 17 birthday along with 13 of her closest friends I made a reservation 7 days prior for Sep 17, I explained Kim who took the reservation there will be a total of 14 teenagers, they all be paying individually. Kim told me I would receive a phone call the morning of to reconfirm but never did, I decided to call and to reconfirm my self! My daughter and her friends complained of the poor service received. The restaurant offered no customer service to teenagers, the server sat them in separate tables of four when I was told they all will seat together. On top of all, they were told they couldn't pay individually but when each table received the bill, the restaurant had already included the gratuity....can you believe that...Kabuki and staff clearly took advantage of teenagers and spoiled a once in a life time birthday dinner that can't be replace.  You can say good by to my loyalty, and will make sure everyone knows of how Kabuki takes advantage of teenagers."}
{"text":"Nice location. Good service for the most part. The food is great. My friends and I come here like every other week. It does get pretty crazy in here so be sure to come early or call ahead."}
{"text":"Kabuki Japanese Restaurant is a great place to go before catching a movie at the Harkins Tempe Theater.  Park on the Northwest of Kabuki and finding a parking spot won't be so difficult, then take a nice walk through the outdoor mall to your movie.  There is so much to talk about Kabuki.  Whether going for a business meeting, lunch, happy hour, meeting relatives and friends or to have a nice dinner with your spouse, Kabuki is a great place with an awesome atmosphere.    I won't lie, my wife and I go to Kabuki quite a bit.  In all, I think we are addicted to eating out.  We used to try and eat out once or twice a week, but it is getting harder and harder as the Phoenix area is gaining such good restaurants.  Kabuki is one of these restaurants.    My wife -  She always orders the oriental chicken salad, her favorite menu item at Kabuki by far. If we go during happy hour, her excuse is, \"The salad costs the same as if I buy two happy hour items.\" She will tell you to order both the ginger and sesame dressing.    Happy Hour - I used to just order two spicy tuna rolls, but now I also have to order the Broiled Mussels on Half Shell.  Here and there I will pickup a Gyoza Dumplings, Seaweed Salad, Sesame Chicken, Fire Cracker, actually I will quit there because I will order everything.    For Lunch - I like to eat spicy tuna roll and a salmon roll.  Just a good meal and a lite lunch.  All other times - My favorite is the Omakase Deluxe.  The Omakase Deluxe is a spicy tuna roll with a wide variety of Nigiri.  If I am not too hungry, I will order a Kabuki Roll.  I will eat the variety or toppings on the kabuki roll as sashimi first, and then the bottom roll separate.    The food is always great and our order is always right.  I have read many reviews and we just haven't experienced the same problems.  Kabuki seems to run a tight ship.  I have yet to find a perfect place, but Kabuki is 5 stars.  With how many times I have been to Kabuki, I imagine they have made a mistake once or twice, but like most places they make it right.    I do enjoy being a member of the Kabuki Red Mask Club.  We earn free meals and get our occasional anniversary and birthday discounts.    Why is the food good at Kabuki?  The answer - The food is fresh and tastes great.  Give it a try, don't judge the restaurant by the people sitting next to you or if they make a mistake.  Judge Kabuki by what they have created and what they offer."}
{"text":"One dollar game day is a great value. Spicy ika salad leaves your mouth on fire! Prob not a destination for sushicons, but good sushi.  --if you can put up with the endless billboards on your way there, it is at the top of the escalator --one dollar game day: on home games, buy one at regular price, get 2nd for $1 --spicy ika salad is delicate, simple and HOT. 3 glasses of water later, I was still on fire. --did I mention the non-stop advertising and billboards? I think westgate has set some kind of record. --don't miss the bathrooms; quite the slanted experience."}
{"text":"The experience in Kabuki was great and everyone enjoy it. I still not sure the food that served in Kabuki is authentic or not, but I definitely like every food that served in there! But due to there is not enough stuff in the soup of udon, which I ordered every time, I will give it four and half star to Kabuki, and I am looking forward to see their improvements and some new dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Kabuki has a happy hour well worth exploring. This Japanese joint is located across from H&M. You would walk past it on your way to AMC theatres.  I was meeting my friend here for a late lunch and was immediately greeted by the host person. Not sure how busy it gets during actual dinner or lunch time but it was quite dead during the happy hour time.. Which is perfect! A quiet and peaceful place.   Kim, our waitress, was very kind and accommodating to our needs. I ordered the Dynamite Roll along with some Salmon nigiri off the happy hour menu which was very good. I really like the Dynamite Roll here and one order was satisfying enough.  We also ordered hot sake (for a first-timer, I did not like it LOL), and then cold white rice sake which had a sweeter taste. I would recommend the cold sake for anyone who isn't a huge fan of hard liquor. Taking the hot sake was like a shot for me... had to down it and made a disgusting squinty face haha. But it was off the happy hour menu so worth the try :) The presentation of the cold sake was cool. It was given in a bucket of ice to keep cool.  The sashimi salad was also a great dish. This is a hit or miss for me because most restaurants seem to lack sashimi pieces. Maybe because we came during a slower hour, but they were generous with the sashimi pieces.  I would recommend hitting this place up during a happy hour as I think their happy hour menu does have a lot to offer for a decent value."}
{"text":"@KabukiCorporate Town Square is a MUST for Locals and Visitors alike  Kabuki is a very nice place with elegant decor and very inviting atmosphere.  When I arrived around 9pm it was quiet so the service was outstanding!! We ordered a wide array of items so we could try as much as possible off the NEW Reverse Happy Hour Menu(2nd item for ONLY $1)  I have never been a connesuir of Asian cuisine but everything was GREAT!! Not fishy as I had expected since that has been my limited experience with Sushi. Everything the brought out was like a piece of art-presented perfectly with sauces and garnishes!! The sushi rolls just melted in your mouth. I'm getting hungry again writing this.  I really kinda played it safe this time around but the way it went I will be back and trying some of the more exotic items on the menu!!! Thanks Kabuki!!"}
{"text":"First time here.   Chose it as a good option following a show at ASU Gammage, offering a post show discount.   Reservations accepted, seated immediately despite being a little early.  Server was a littler bland but provided good service and answered questions well.   The food was outstanding.   Another,  closer to home restaurant for sushi has been my fav, but Kabuki hands down beat them out!   The garlic edamame was great,  Brussel sprouts and shishito peppers cooked perfect, the rolls (cilantro albacore, baja roll, baked scallop roll,  and crunchy asparagus/ salmon roll) outstanding!   Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"I could not wait to eat at this place since it was advertised at Town Square.   I finally got the chance for lunchtime with my son.   Right away we were greeted with a smile and was seated right away.  (It helped it was not lunch rush yet). We started with spider roll which was yummy and big.  I always end up getting a bento box and a sashimi sampler.  The presentation was superb and beautiful for the sampler.  ---however the fish looked kinda dry....tasted fresh but looked dry.  Who could go wrong with the bento box.  I just wish the salad had the miso peanut dressing rather than that gingery salad dressing.  Our waiter- \"Won\" was very attentive and always had a smile on his face.    This makes a nice place for a date or out of towners for that ambiance setting.    I would go here again.....but maybe not as a first choice."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this restaurant! Very much my style. I also love their food and drinks & their staff is really nice. As for drinks, I recommend their lycheetini (spelling?).. SO good! And I usually get the Cali roll which is also really good. :]"}
{"text":"I needed a cure to a sushi craving, and that cure was Kabuki, kind of...  I rallied some co-workers to get some lunchtime sushi, so we headed over to Kabuki.  It was nice out, so we sat outside.  That was part of the problem.  The service outside was not so good.  My friend had to ask for a water refill 4 times from 3 different people (including a manager) and didn't get it until we were leaving.  It took a long time to get through the lunch (over an hour).  Hopefully they'll work that kink out as they are open longer.  I only ordered sushi rolls and edamame, so I can't speak to the rest of the menu.  We tried about 5 different rolls and they were all pretty good.  Some weren't my flavor, but that comes with the trying new things territory.  I've had better sushi, but it wasn't bad.  My biggest gripe is that they cut the rolls into 6 pieces which makes them hard to eat because the pieces are WAY too big for me and I felt like I was chewing forever.  Next time I am there I will ask them to cut it into 8 pieces.  If they'll do that, they have a returning customer here.  I'll bump 'em up to 3.5 stars for the great happy hour prices.  The sushi craving wasn't completely cured, but subdued for now."}
{"text":"Great customer service; decent sushi & happy hour.   I like the ambiance at Kabuki. It's modern in decor, dimly lit, with high ceilings. There are plenty of big booths and tables for seating. There's a bar to your right when you walk in where we usually sit. The bartenders are all incredibly friendly and attentive to our needs. We've  had Jeff a few times and he is phenomenal. We get serviced just moments after we sit down.   Happy hour has quite a few items to choose from and the prices range from $4 rolls to $7 apps. I usually eat light here for happy hour and come mainly to enjoy their ki bombs. I've ordered the broiled mussels, seaweed salad, fire cracker, and a few of their rolls. They have $6 ki bombs (draft Saporro and hot sake) which is always a must when I come here. Who doesn't love good ol' sake bombs?!  I've also had their chicken yakitori, tuna poke, sashimi salad, soy ramen, and a few other dishes. The food here is okay but I wouldn't recommend Kabuki for the best sushi and Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas. I would recommend to stop by for happy hour if you're in Town Square and craving some sake! It's located in Town Square where I go frequently and I'm never disappointed with the service. I'll be back this month!"}
{"text":"Really good Japanese food. We were not disappointed with any of our choices. Will definitely go back again. If you don't mind paying a little extra it's well worth it. Quality is worth the price."}
{"text":"I like the food and chefs, but the service here blows. They don't great you at the door, standing with their backs to you, and not even acknowledging a proper American greeting, like \"Hello\",  or \"How are you today\".  I think management needs to find a way to.boost morale or incentives, since the wait staff is so lame. Someone please tell them to step it up a bit. Sat for 20 minutes waiting for our water and iced tea, and no order allowed until maybe 30 minutes in. Plan on taking an hour + to just get your food."}
{"text":"During a day of errands at Fry's Electronics(love that store!), my son and I were looking for a good spot for lunch. We headed over to Town Square, to check it out, and see what they had to offer. We parked and ended up being in the middle of \"Yard House\" and \"Kabuki\". There was a kiosk in the middle of the restaurants, so i decided to get the opinion of the gentlemen hanging out there. He recommended Kabuki, and we're glad he did.  We walked in, and the place looked great. Very modern, with magnum sake bottles lining the walls of the entrance(refer to pic) and nice curved walls leading to your table.   Denise was our server. She was very nice, and full of smiles. She took our drink order and even made some chocolate milk for my son, which was greatly appreciated. After we ordered, they brought out edamame to start(refer to pic). My son has never had edamame before, but quickly fell in love with it. I love edamame, especially with a dash of salt on each. MMMmmmMMmmm... so good.    For lunch, i ordered  the \"Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll\"(refer to pic). The roll was...okay. Nothing special. The spicy sauce that was drizzled on the bottom of the plate, was by far, the best part of the dish. I also order the \"Chicken Teriyaki\"(refer to pic) from the lunch menu. It came with a bowl of \"Miso Soup\"(refer to pic), a salad and a very generous portion of chicken. The miso soup was excellent, like always. I'm a sucker for miso soup. The salad was under-dressed and could have been much better. The chicken teriyaki, on the other hand, was fantastic! That teriyaki sauce was BANGING! So delicious, i could have licked the plate.   My son ordered the #2 which is \"Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Shrimp\"(refer to pic). Once again, very generous portion size, especially for a child. I was thinking, \"i should have just got that.\". The kids #2 came with a salad, tempura shrimp and green beans, chicken teriyaki, and rice. He loved it! They also brought out \"Chop Stick Helpers\"(refer to pick). How awesome?! Now my son will be using chop sticks in no time!  Throughout lunch, Denise stopped over to check on us, refill our waters, and make small talk. She was attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. Thanks Denise for giving us a great lunch. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had the alaskan roll with salmon on top,also salmon and tempura with was very delicious,the ambiance was really cool from the decorate to the chef's everytime some one come in they would say( Kangei ) which is welcome I think..If I am wrong somebody please let know,oh yeah the bath room was extremely clean that have a check off sheet on the wall when it was clean last,for us no disappointment here."}
{"text":"Have been coming here nearly every Friday since we moved here in August.  Being from Seattle and having traveled to Japan, I'd have to say...pretty good sushi especially in the desert.  The staff is great, service is quick, and prices are reasonable.  We usually get the tempura, and I'll have 1 sushi order and I am stuffed.  They also have happy hour which is a great deal if you can get in before 6.  We subscribe to their Red Mask Rewards card and have already received our reward!"}
{"text":"I decided to drop by for a quick bite to eat. Our server was great in quickly getting our order in and bringing out our food. Our sushi was delicious. My only negative comment was the restaurant is not very child friendly. We had to leave our stroller behind the host table and there was no changing table in the restroom. Not being kid friendly is the only reason I would not return."}
{"text":"Kabuki is among my top sushi places.  I like to go here with the girls for a ladies night, followed by shopping and a movie.  Of course I get my favorite, the spicy tuna.  We have start the meal with the Tokyo Quesadilla. This is an appetizer that consists of fried wonton skins, mozzarella cheese, and baja tomato salsa.  It is a perfect starter, but be sure to use the salsa.  We usually end up eating our first piece fast so we can beat the rest to a second helping.  Most importantly you must try the mint Sakerita.  We don't know what is it in per se, but it is cool and refreshing and perfect for a hot Arizona day.  Not that it needs to be hot out, as I like it anytime of the year.  If you're not into sake, the Tokyo Mule is a great alternative, the ginger beer is a good compliment to the sushi itself.  We rarely wait for a table, but the bar tends to be fairly packed.  They do not have TVs in the dining area, so if you're in the mood to catch the big game you need to sit in the bar.  Kabuki is one of the little gems that Tempe Marketplace has to offer and will ensure you start your shopping experience on the right note."}
{"text":"We love this Kabuki at Tivoli Village! The food is always great and the service, fast & friendly. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is always super nice and accommodating. We try to make it to their happy hour once a week(which is everyday from 3pm-6pm)...and they have great deals on sushi rolls! Our favorites are the Large roll, spicy tuna rolls, the Alaskan roll and the BSCR roll. They have a great salmon teriyaki and tempura combo and their noodle soups are delicious. Everything is fresh and beautifully made. 5 stars, for sure!"}
{"text":"The Chirashi Sushi dish is one of my favorite dishes... anywhere.  The rice is always perfectly cooked and the seasoning plentiful.  The sashimi that tops this dish is generally good but there have been times that I've been disappointed.  In my experiences, the staff have always been pleasant and courteous."}
{"text":"I thought it was overpriced even for sushi and the rolls aren't anything to write home about. I wouldn't choose this place for sushi. Didn't much care for the ambience either."}
{"text":"Service is fast and attentive but the food is not special and very overpriced.   Expect to pay half as much downtown."}
{"text":"Love this place! Come here at least twice a month. Food is delicious and fresh. I love the hibachi rice and California roll! But the menu is just beyond that."}
{"text":"I came here during my birthday month because when you sign up for their email newsletter they give you a $15.00 coupon to use for your birthday! It was perfect because my breaded seafood dish costs $15.95. My brother and husband who don't really eat Japanese food ordered their usual house salad (very good) $4.95  , chicken fingers $6.95 , and Chicken Tokyo Qesadilla $5.95. We always sit in the bar area because the service is always excellent and you don't have to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"8/06 First visit.  Happy hour.  Two rolls- A Philadelphia and a spicy salmon roll, deep-fried, with roe on top.  Most sushi spots gladly substitute an ingredient if the regular order contains allergens I can't have without an upcharge.  Not Kabuki.  (I've had owners, chefs, and cooks tell me themselves that if a recipe is easily amenable, they'll gladly do the substitutions, w/ no offense taken.  This Kabuki chef isn't one of them.)  So food photos will reflect these recipe omissions.  Ordered a glass of house pinot grigio, which had a big black speck floating in it, but this was quickly remedied.    So few HH apps and drinks to choose from.  Servers were friendly enough, but sushi chef was VISIBLY annoyed (full face-frontal) when I had to return a dish as it contained an allergen I requested not to be used.  I could understand the offense if I had forgotten to include the info, or if I had multiple orders that made it hard for him to keep track, but a mistake on the second of two dishes, and with a list of allergens on a note right under your nose as a reminder??    Atmosphere is nothing to right home about.  I did like the lone red mosaic tile in the women's restroom.  Loved the contrast against the all-black theme."}
{"text":"Jeez.. I do love me some Kabuki. We went out of our way just to have some sushi from Kabuki. Their poor service never fails, but oh well.. the food is absolutely delicious. And how do you NOT know what an LA water is?? I don't get it.."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots. Beer and sushi at a smokin' deal and the bartenders are always friendly. Be warned there are some regulars that will steal the attention from the bartender and create a bit of a wait on service, but the friendly service easily makes up for it.  I started with the Cucumber Mojito and was impressed with how good it was. I'm usually not a Mojito fan, but a friend convinced me to try it. It will now be my drink of choice at Kabuki. We split a few rolls and loved them all, especially the Tempura California Roll. It's a must eat."}
{"text":"This is my second time to this place and location and I really like it. The service is very good! The food came out quickly and it was very yummy. I love how great variety of food and drinks they have."}
{"text":"One of the best places for sushi rolls! We tried the Vegas roll, shrimp grilled roll, and spicy tuna roll. It was really delicious and the Vegas roll was the best. As a halal guy, I can't eat some type of fishes. So we asked them to remove the crab from they rolls and they totally understand us.  Definitely, I would come back again and try the other rolls. Make sure you come at the happy hours!"}
{"text":"Worst Japanese Restaurant ever!  Chicken Teriyaki came out raw!!! Gross and then the manager comes out and says all chicken should be pink or red because we use young chickens!   Attitude very poor!      I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, food was awful!!!    We will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great sake and great food. Everything tasted very fresh and presentation was beautiful. Classy decor made it a perfect date night. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place, and I came in here for a quick lunch, thinking I would be a little bit late back to work, but I wasn't.  First of all, their server Annie was phenominal!  She has such a great attitude, she was quick, and she was on top of everything.  I felt bad because I was working during lunch, and I was in a hurry, but because of her I was in an out with great food and great service.  And the sushi chefs are amazing as always!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! Pretty chill atmosphere, decent prices, great food!  Doesnt matter what roll you get, they are all tasty. Just make sure you get the spicy mayo! It has a kick to it, definitely the best spicy mayo anywhere. I can eat dirt if it had this spicy mayo on top.. but Im not gonna try.  Nice place off the strip to chill, shop, eat some sushi and grab some yogurt next door ( we didnt go but it must be good since there was a line during our entire dinner )"}
{"text":"I don't think I like Kabuki Restaurants in general (I also went to the one in Westgate).  Ambience: -very nice, I went here for a lunch date -intimate but spacious, plenty of seating -small patio for those who like to eat and people-watch  Staff: -took awhile for the hostess to return to her station to seat us -waitress was relatively attentive and friendly  Food: -free edamame starter... yum -**FREE** California roll with Yelp App check-in. No hassle getting the server to accept it, but it wasn't very good. We only ate 2 pieces, was warm/mushy. -we both ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Lunch Combo which also comes with Veggie and Shrimp Tempura, miso soup and a side salad. Alot of food for ~$10. My chicken was barely warm and dried out (can you say \"precooked\"), miso soup was delicious as was the tempura. I would not order the teriyaki chicken again.  Drinks: -a large sake bomber (during non-peak hours) was almost as much as the lunch... almost $10?!?!  Notes: -under the table had not been swept in awhile  Like I said at the beginning, I think Kabuki has been officially 86'd from my list of restaurants that I will willingly go to. It's like a Panda Express that someone put pearls and lipstick on. Cheap, mass-produced food in a nice sit-down atmosphere."}
{"text":"mehhhhh. That about sums it up.   Glad to know there's a sushi restaurant in Westgate, but they could do better.   Atmosphere:  -nice, \"take-your-date-here\" atmosphere -plenty of seating -seating also at sushi bar and liquor bar -relatively loud, specifically at the liquor bar -patio seating as well, don't know if you can order here  Food: -complimentary edemame for starters with meal. Was served cold and somewhat slimy. -CHEAP happy hour (I was there for the 9-close one). $3.50 spicy tuna rolls and $1.50 sake or draft Sapporo (only 12 oz). -must ask for wasabi/ginger with sushi. Wut?! -cut rolls are sliced VERY large. Difficult to get in the mouth in one go (that's what he said!! ;)) -spicy tuna was very mushy and a bit warm. Alot more tuna in the roll than other sushi joints I've been to.  Staff:  -bartender (Shane?) was handsome, polite and genuinely a good guy all around. He was really kind to a guest who had too much to drink and encouraged him to stick around until he sobered up. Good guy! -most of the staff seemed to be buddies with servers from other Westgate restaurants. Normally I wouldn't mind, but it seemed like there were SO many of them that all the attention and conversation was diverted their way and as a result, affected my service. I'd just suggest that they keep the banter and friend-talk to a healthy level and spend more time with new guests to encourage them to come back.  To sum, I'd come back for sushi if I were shopping at the Tanger Outlets again, but I wouldn't necessarily come back here if I weren't already in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place!  There are literally only two sushi places in all of Vegas that I will even consider eating at and today this became the second. The food was prepared perfectly and the service was on point from start to finish. And where else are you going to find fresh strawberry lemonade at a sushi joint that's right only here! Started off with a steak skewer and the spicy Tina on crispy rice appetizers both tasted super fresh and the sauces were perfectly matched to the flavor of the dish. For my entree I got the spider roll my gf got the pyramid they were both excellent and huge I mean these portions are great for the price I will deff be hosting some dinners with friends at this restaurant in the near future cause I think all of the people around me should be able to enjoy some awesome sushi. Also I love the fact that they encourage customer feedback any place that strives to be better should be rated fairly high on yelp and it didn't hurt that the food was just amazing from the beginning to the end."}
{"text":"Great place to go eat. Love 25 dollar gift card on your birthday there happy hour is amazing I love kabuki"}
{"text":"Love this place. Just joined there loyalty program and already almost earned a $25 gift card for coming so often. This is my wife and myself go to spot. We always try and bring people here."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised to be presented with a complimentary seaweed and cucumber salad shortly after being seated.  The snow crab roll, although not the most aesthetically pleasing, was a delectable treat of  cucumber, avocado, sweet mayo, and snow crab all wrapped up in soy paper.  If you love lobster and California rolls, their lotus roll is absolutely amazing! The lobster that tops the California roll is warm and melts in your mouth. It is a definite must!"}
{"text":"Walked by a couple of times heading over to Saddle ranch, but this time I said \"lets do it!\" , being a sushi snob , I was happy to try a new place.  After being sat in what seemed to be the norm of red and black decor , was sat right next to a server station , however next to the window which was pleasant.   Food- I ordered The Pyramis roll, which got me with the Yuzu tartar sauce, and also a spicy tuna roll.( although generic I think it says alot , its like a chef cooking chicken, you should alwasy get it right.) The Tuna roll was way too large and had to be cut in half in order for me to fit it in my mouth, waaay to much rich. However the pyramid roll was fantastic, left me wanting more.  Booze time- I had a Tokyo Mojito with cucumber. it tasted exactly like you would think, nothing special , but refreshing.  Service- I must say I have had way better. It was a simple, \" something to drink?\" , what would you like to eat\" and \" thank you\" at the end, very cut and dry. So bad? no, good? no.  Overall I would go back if I wanted Sushi and was at Westgate, but I wouldnt be sitting at home thinking \" OH LETS GO THERE TONIGHT\""}
{"text":"Every Kabuki I've been to is the same. Just mediocre meals. Came here the other day and it was pretty busy so I was expecting a wait and shitty service like the ones in SoCal. But instead, the hostess (Giana?? I think that was her name) kept us pretty entertained and gave pretty good hospitality while we waited. So we got our table and I figured, its gonna be a wait might as well  knock a brew. Food is alright, (Chefs, I understand its busy, I'm not trippin) & Service was stellar."}
{"text":"We go here about once a month.  Every sushi plate we get is super delish!  The hostess and the waiters are always super attentive and professional.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tonight I went here for Happy hour and got Marisa as my waitress, she totally rocks as a server and I hope I get her ever time I visit.  The food portions are amazing for the price (even the happy hour).  I was expecting half orders or smaller portions and it was exactly opposite.  I will be making this my new hang out for sushi from now on.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Picked Veggies including my favorite burdock, uni sushi, cold organic tofu with ikkura sashimi, 5 additional pices of tuna sashimi, a lychee martini and a glass of white wine, business dinner for one, $55.  All my favorite items presented with no fuss and a can do what ever you like attitude. An extensive menu with pretty common items, not much out of the ordinary.  Quality was good, not the best ever but very very acceptable.  Attentive service for my party of one."}
{"text":"I went here to meet up with some people and it was pretty good. We got garlic edamame & this yellowtail jalapeño platter for starters. My friend got a salmon fillet for her daughter and they were super accommodating in terms of helping her find a dish for her picky eater and keeping the sauces and everything on the side. So that was nice. I got a water and the waiter refilled it like 50 times because I just kept drinking like I have never had water before. But that was nice, my glass never got empty or stayed empty for longer than a minute or two.  For our meal we shared some sushi rolls; the spicy tuna, spicy tuna crunch, halibut shashimi, and this other one with avocado on top & tuna inside (can't remember the name). We also got miso soups and then strawberry mochis; we had an uneven amount and they brought us a fourth one on the house-mango! The presentation was nice and everything tasted good. I enjoyed my meal and it wasn't too loud and the wait time wasn't noticeable. The only thing- I thought my friend ordered a caterpillar roll, but it never came. They didn't say anything though, and they were buying, so I didn't mention it but also I could have misheard that. Oh well. This is like a high 4.5 for me; there just wasn't anything that really wowed me, but I wouldn't mind coming back because it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Had date lunch with my sister here!!!  Located in Tivoli Village in Summerlin - Though we've been to Tivoli Village before - It was the first visit to Kabuki for us both.    Large open floor plan.  Bar Lounge to your left and more private tables and dining area to your right.  We came here for lunch and had Dumplings for starters and Martini's.  The Sake Coconut martini is quite tasty.    We also shared the Sashimi Moriawase sushi.  Very good.  Presentation very nice.  Sushi served on shaved ice.  It was perfect amount for two.  Menu has array of different dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Felt full at the end of the meal and price was reasonable for the amount food you get. But service was very slow. Servers did not seem to know what order people came in. We were not the only people to complain about this. Meal was very good, but very disappointed by the slow service."}
{"text":"Ok so I was soo excited to go back to kabuki, since I loved their happy hour. But I was so disappointed. They had changed the happy hour menu and removed most of my favorite items. The service was good but definitely not worth going back. It was a major let down. We will be going some place else the next time we want sushi. Another favorite bites the dust."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool and the food was amazing...  Really liked the style and design of the restaurant.... The main thing is the food...  So let me get started...  This was my first time going to this restaurant.... And I went for a birthday party....  It was a group of 11 people.... So I got to taste a lot of different dishes.... Everything from the sushi, which is  hand-rolled to order, soup, salad, pasta, and noodle soup...  Was AMAZINGLY GOOD....The prices weren't too bad....  I will most definitely be going there again..."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night with my hubby a few days ago and was surprised at the cost, the reverse happy hour menu was awesome. We had gone shopping and wanted to grab something before going to the movies so we stopped in. Now the customer service was a bit \"meh\" not bad not horrible. We did have to ask for the check to leave 2 times tho. We got 5 rolls, California, eel, Vegas, dynamite and avocado and also some garlic edamame, I also got a sprite to drink, all the food and sushi was great and fresh, the bill for all of that(we didn't finish it was too much!) it was under 40 bucks. I was surprised!! We spent almost the same amount just at Applebee's. Overall, great sushi and awesome reverse happy hour, service could use some tlc but I will go back."}
{"text":"really good sushi with a great price, considering that its in tivoli village. everything tasted fresh and everything is prepared really nice. the restaurant its self is decorated nice. this place is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour from 3-6pm Mon-Fri, which is a great time to try their specials. They also have a later happy hour as well. I really like their location, ambiance & service. They're inside town square, so you feel like your away from the city. The sushi is always fresh & delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places I've ever been to. Way better than RA sushi this place has so many options, really good happy hour and plenty of vegetarian favorites! Love!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch with some friends on a Saturday afternoon.  We arrived around 11:30, so they had just opened and weren't too busy, yet.  BTW, when we left, it was hopping!  We decided to order combos, one friend got the lunch special of salmon teriyaki w/shrimp tempura, another got the baked scallop roll and an order of dumplings and I got the Philadelphia roll and mixed tempura with a side of eel sauce.  We received salads prior to our main dishes, and this is the reason for 1 less star...the salads were okay, but not enough dressing and, like someone said in another review, kinda messy.    Salads aside, everything else was delicious!  Our waiter was delightful, friendly, attentive and funny.  We kept changing our minds with what we wanted, and he just went with it...didn't get frustrated or curt with us.  And, everything came as ordered.  Plus, he gave me a nice helping of the eel sauce, which I told him I loved!  FYI--I could drink it on it's own, but I do prefer to dip everything in it...LOL!  All in all, we had a wonderful time, and plan on heading back up to the 2nd level again for some lovely Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I travel for business weekly and always make sure to come here when I'm in town! The sushi is fantastic, location is great, and the staff is excellent too. I always ask for Yoo Mi or Linde as my server as they remember my boss and I & always take care of us! Can't wait to come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice (once before they opened and once a few days after) and I do like it.  I have never been to the Town Square location but I understand it is a Southwest US chain so I imagine it is quite similar there.  The first time I was at the Yelp Rehearsal Dinner CMYE and my review chronicled my eating there, but I was thoroughly impressed with items on the sushi menu that are more rare here: suzuki (sea bass), aji (Spanish mackerel), hotategai (jumbo whole scallop) and anago (sea eel).  The jumbo scallop was massive and hung over the rice, and melted in my mouth.  We also had the geisha roll (I love how shiso leaf is a key ingredient) and the yellowtail jalepeno (delicious).  Eric R. was not too happy with the hibachi steak and chicken meat quality but everything else was great.  I also had the salmon skin handroll (they do not do them in a cone shape) and it was huge and delicious.  I had the usual iced green tea.  Our server Paul was great.  When I returned I sat at the sushi bar.  I was entertained by Chef Terry and Chef Bobby.  I ordered the aji tataki appetizer - the aji was not very tasty this time (I prefer sushi style I guess) - chopped awkwardly with green onion and ginger, with wakame and daikon on the side and ponzu sauce.  Skip this.  I asked the chefs their opinion and got salmon with green onion (belly cut, they understood my love of fatty fish), hamachi belly (with kaiware sprout), and the jumbo scallop again.  The scallop was much smaller but just as melt-y and fresh.  I freakin' love it!  The chefs were awesome and entertaining.  Chef Terry gave me a spicy tuna handroll with less mayo, added jalepenos, and spicy ponzu on the side.  I also had iced tropical green tea (unsweetened).  The handroll was not that amazing (tuna quality was eh) but Chef Terry told me he can do better for quality and cuts next time.  I had a $10 off $30 deal from the grand opening so this was a great deal on a meal.  They do have lunch specials, happy hours, and reverse happy hours so there is more to explore here!"}
{"text":"Sorry, this is not 4 1/2 stars. While many reviews tout the service here, I found it not all that great. Water for some, but not, all in the party; salads delivered to us while miso soup (on same tray) sits cooling, unattended, at the empty table nearby. Pointing to the forgotten soup, it's brought to us, but no longer hot. Once hot soup showed up, it was definitely good.   I like the option of small plates here - one of the ways to build your meal. Some in our party ordered individual sushi pieces and also the small plate of miso black cod. I had a taste of the black cod, and it was certainly ok, if not amazing. Seemed maybe a bit reliant on the sweet miso prep, rather than the natural sweetness of black cod itself.   I ordered the Chirashi bowl - A decent collection of fish atop your choice of white, brown or 'sushi' rice. Tasted fresh, and pretty reasonable at just under $20. I got to try the shrimp tempura, which was pretty standard tasting - not exceptional.   I ordered the Brussels sprouts, which was the one truly interesting dish of the night. Fun, almost like tempura. Flaky, crunchy and savory, this is absolutely something to try.   A decent array of wine and sake and beer. Colorful interior at the Tivoli Village. You could do worse, but the enthusiasm of all the reviews I read here about Kabuki do not match my experience."}
{"text":"Coming here regularly is a nice treat if you have a kabuki card for points and enjoy going out for sushi etc. This is a great restaurant to go with someone who is new to Japanese cuisine since there is a wide menu selection from ramen dishes to the raw sashimi style. There snow crab sushi is very fresh as well as there fish in general. The texture is not slimy. I would say it has a nice standard for sushi compared to most \"fusion\" styles in Las Vegas. If you order a lot and require a lot to be full the price can be a bit pricey. Expect to pay over 100$ easily. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna crunch roll is my jam. Vegas roll and rainbow roll are also on point. Love getting these and some ka bombs during happy hour"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch the other day and I have to say that Kabuki doesn't disappoint.  By the way, shout out to Hoon Lim, the manager at Kabuki!  The service and attention we got during lunch was attentive and efficient. We started off with the Calamari and Roasted Brussel Sprouts, then wrapped it up with an Albacore Roll and Sunkissed Roll.  All of which were delicious.  Each dish offering a flavor that really lights up your taste buds.  It's in a great location near Yogurtland and AMC theatres at town square.  If you're a sushi  connoisseur like myself, you will certainly enjoy the selection of rolls and the ambiance.  Great job to Hoon and the team at Kabuki for running a great establishment."}
{"text":"I always love Kabuki. The food is always fresh and high quality and the service is always good."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this location at least a few times each month and this visit wasn't any different. Quickly seated with a friendly waiter. The rolls usually don't take very long to come out which is a plus in my book. The only thing you really ever end up waiting for are the fried appetizers or chicken which is so so delicious! Another surprising option on the menu is their wonton tacos. They're wontons with a Mexican twist ,  served with an addicting baja sauce.  I usually end up dipping random other foods into it just because it's that good!  Another great experience, be sure to check them out."}
{"text":"The service was great, Sashimi planter very good, however, did not like the chefs special surrounding the Sashimi. They should stick to letting the customer choose their own side on the planter such as (avocados, cucumbers, etc)."}
{"text":"Been here TONS of times. Always solid. Everything always tastes fresh to me. I could fill up on their jumbo scallop nigiri and call it a day. It literally melts in your mouth :)     They have an extensive Japanese food menu and LOTS of specialty rolls and 4 pages of appetizers! Don't miss these because there are some gems on there like the firecracker.   The decor is very cool (don't miss the bathrooms) and they have outdoor seating which is really nice when it's not too hot. If you haven't tried it, you should. Especially if you can hit happy hour during the week!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad at all. The grapefruit mojitos are great. (I had three.)  Althought the food wasn't that bad. I could of sworn it was happy hour and yet we still spent a pretty penny. I still think Sushi Mon on Silverado is a tad better."}
{"text":"i really like this place I wasn't really into eating sushi this day And most of time we go out for lunch This place always looks dead But then again it lunch time The food is good and really flavorful And the prices are very good The service is always good here And definitely  would recommend for sushi and non sushi eaters Cant wait for next visit"}
{"text":"A four-star rating to me is always one that says, \"It didn't blow my mind, but I did have more than just a good experience!\"  My party was seated immediately on a beautiful Sunday afternoon spent at Tivoli Village. The following was ordered: Salmon Teriyaki with brown rice, a Rainbow Roll, some Miso soup, an Eel and Avocado Roll, and an Apple Crumble Tartlet. Everything was great! The food also came much earlier than I had expected. Who wouldn't love that?  Our server, Spencer, was both very helpful and friendly! I'd also like to note that when he suggested a certain item from the menu, it was never too presumptuous. We left him a nice note (something I liked to do when I enjoy the service) and a generous tip for being an ideal server. Spencer even went out of his way to thank us! It was a great first experience for my friends who had never been to Tivoli. Kabuki is a must! It's a happy medium for both sushi and non-sushi fans!"}
{"text":"Like most other reviewers, I think Kabuki is best during their happy hour. It's consistently decent Japanese food and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere to chill out in.  The sushi is good. The prices are average.  The eel sauce is excellent though, I wish they would put it under every roll they offer. A big plus is how they always give you edamame with your meal.  I'll definitely go back especially if I happen to be at Town Square having a beer at Yard House."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials.  For around $10 or less, you can choose from various lunch combos which include soup, salad, and rice.  I had the ninja lunch combo which included teriyaki chicken, 3 pieces of California roll, one piece of shrimp tempura and various vegetable tempuras.  With the combo there is more than enough food and chances are you will probably have leftovers.  The meal itself was decent.  The tempura batter was not as crunchy as I would have liked it, but the shrimp and vegetables are fresh and flavorful.  The teriyaki sauce on the chicken was nice- not too salty or sweet.  If I am in the area again I'd like to come here to try their happy hour or reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"It must be sushi week for me, as this was my second helping in 4 days. I met a friend here for lunch after a morning at the movies. I used to visit Kabuki frequently when I first started working in my current position, but then a group of friends reported not feeling well after a visit and I had not returned in the year since then. Upon further review, I seem to have forgotten to include that side note when recommending to my friend that we eat there. My bad.    We arrived about 12:30 on Sunday. We discovered the menu indicating select items were on sale during Cardinal game days. By one item from a section of the menu at regular price and another item in that section was $1. Good news - the Cardinals were playing (well, at least they suited up for the game), but I digress...as you may have seen from prior reviews of mine, I am limited in my sushi knowledge. I went for the comfort zone and ordered the Philadelphia roll. I can't really tell you what we had - I do remember to Kiren beer, the Philly roll, a lotus roll, something with scallops...something else...I can't forget her eel (which I reluctantly tried a teenie tiny corner of, but really it wasn't bad.  The restaurant has a nice appearance. Very comfortable and spacious. It was not crowded at all, which made for a nice dining experience. The waiter was very cool, gave us time to review the menu and provided excellent service.    I am still not sure what I ate, but I was in good hands with our waiter and my dining partner. I would totally trust her recommendations any time - unless she made me eat that whole eel. Then I might have to reconsider...It was an enjoyable afternoon and I will definitely return to Kabuki again."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered A couple Vegas rolls Togo on a Friday. It was slow so The food came out quickly and the hostess was super friendly. When I go to work (which is 3miles away) I opened my Togo box and was immediately bummed. The rolls were super sloppy looking (like they just threw everything on there quickly) and were small. Nothing special and they were mediocre in taste. I was still hungry after I ate. Not satisfied at all especially for $25! I used to love this place and know it used to be better. I am sad to say that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Kabuki is great at being good all-around, and helps narrow the gap between the casual/westernized and traditional Japanese food. It won't be the absolute best restaurant, but it's solid, and pretty fail-safe. The large menu caters to many tastes - the reasonable prices and large servings make for great, casual lunch specials, while the full-blown sushi menu will satisfy fish junkies too. There'll always be something for any mood.    Well, for any of my friends' moods, at least. I have culinary tunnel-vision at Kabuki, and will only order specials that include their teriyaki chicken (which is delicious, and amazing, and delicious again), so I can't vouch for anything else myself, but so far, my companions have always seemed happy with their many different orders. In particular, they swear by the freshness of the tuna and salmon, they like the rolls, and we appreciate how even the smallest side dish is pretty good on its own.   The staff is friendly and attentive, and service is very fast considering how busy it gets. The restaurant has excellent ambiance; it's classy enough for a dinner date, but casual enough that you could just drop by mid-day for some teriyaki chicken. No, seriously, it's sweet and moist and uncomplicated and all the things you want it to be, so go get some and be filled (big portions!) with happiness."}
{"text":"Food was fair.  Service was opinionated about the bad management, how he had to do the dishes and how poorly staffed it is for the 4th of July.  Then he condescendingly asked \"what about you, how was your day did you have a nice pancake breakfast and a BBQ?\"  Holy shit balls kid!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, potentially even a 4 if the service can improve.   This place doesn't necessarily have the best sushi or traditional Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas, but it's pretty consistent with decent, enjoyable meals, moderate prices, and friendly staff. Most of the menu consists of average, typical Japanese food; however, I must give 5 stars to their Ramen.... they have 3 different kinds: the soy, spicy miso, and the char-sui... and all I can say is WOW. That is officially my meal nearly every time I go because other places in Vegas where it's claimed to have the \"best\" ramen in town (Monta or Anime Ramen), I personally believe are highly overrated!! The ramen in Kabuki in particular is fantastic, and I would prefer it over Monta or Anime's any day.   I like to switch up the appetizers so that there's variety on the table, plus I can try something new every time. Their grilled calamari is yum! I tried some of my friend's seafood salad and it is a generous portion of fresh seafood variety.   The people who work here are VERY nice, but they don't have much serving experience. It is easily seen that they don't know how to multi-task, and they always seem so flustered even when the restaurant isn't very busy. It may take a while for water to be refilled and it is rare for them to check on you during your meal more than once... Perhaps a full, thorough staff training is in order! The positive attitudes and hospitable traits in the staff are definitely there; they just need some pointers in service :)"}
{"text":"after a long day shopping came in and ate during happy hour. good prices, but the waiter ordered one extra sushi roll and charged us for it even though we complaimed and he admitted he ordered it by mistake. besides horrible service, the sushi is excellent. docked off a star becuase of the dodgy waiter, beware."}
{"text":"Good sushi. However, nothing special than any other sushi place."}
{"text":"Dined at Kabuki on a Saturday night and it was ok. Just ok. I had a couple different rolls which were good but I've had better. My boyfriend had teriyaki steak and fried rice. The steak was the best thing on the table! The fried rice was not very good. It was dry and hard and was lacking that true \"hibachi style\" fried rice flavor. The service was great though and the atmosphere is very nice! But I am in no rush to go back and I'll give other sushi places a try first."}
{"text":"Came here again.   Nothing has changed.  Still grossly overpriced.  I went during happy hour and used my friends first responder discount and it was still over $30 for a two rolls and a Coke.  That's before tip also."}
{"text":"There are soooo many sushi restaurants here in Vegas and I usually go to a spot that is recommended by friends and family. This  place was recommended by my friend's colleague.  Located in a prime location --Towne Square, this is the perfect place to end a day of shopping. While no shopping was involved on this particular day, my husband and I thought we would venture into Towne Square and see if we could get a table at Kabuki's. We only had to wait 15 minutes (on a Friday night) and while waiting, enjoyed a few drinks in the bar area.  To my delight, they had Hamachi Kama which is the cheek of the fish both tasty and grilled just right. We also  ordered a half dozen of the Hamahama oysters, gyoza, several pairs of ahi, salmon, ikura (salmon roe), ama ebi, and a quail egg shooter ( a a raw quail egg in ponzu sauce). Everything tasted very fresh. I normally don't order any rolls as I just enjoy nigiri or sashimi, however there was one roll that caught my eye: the Geisha roll. Unfortunately, I had no room to add to my tummy so that will have to wait for my next visit which will happen very soon. Service was great, food was wonderful and atmosphere was nice, not too bright and not too dark.  I am giving 4 stars as I have still not found a better sushi restaurant than Shiro's in Seattle. While the fish was fresh here at Kabuki's, it still did not have the melt-in-your-mouth experience as Shiro's. However, Kabuki's is at the top of my list here in Vegas for sushi. I will be back for happy hour and that Geisha roll!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places I've found when I moved here 6 years ago. They only had the location at Town Square. Thankfully when I had moved to Summerlin area they built this second location.   My girlfriend and I met up for lunch there early in the week. She had one of their lunch specials. Salmon, brown rice and salad. I kept to my two favorite rolls, Sunkissed Roll and Philadelphia roll.   Make sure you sign up for the rewards card if you like good sushi. They have Awesome perks with their points system. I used to eat there atleast once or twice a week. They give you $25 for your anniversary of being a member, $15 for your birthday, and every $250 you get $25 to spend. The money does expire but if you live sushi it's a good deal. The membership card is free.   They have a great happy hour from 4-6p and then a really good late night happy hour 9p-close. Lots of options for the sushi lover. The wines and sake are great too!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. BEST SUSHI EVER. I always go for happy hour! Absolutely the best! I get the seaweed salad, fire cracker, and Alaskan rolls! I wish they would open more locations in other cities! I'm dying to have one in Portland, OR!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and am impressed with the quality and portions from their lunch menu. The beef sukiyaki is worth ordering and the spicy tuna on crispy rice was really good. I would come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I am definitely a repeat customer, not just in Vegas but also in California. The employees were very nice and the Sushi was great."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time now. I LOVE the atmosphere unlike other sushi restaurants that i have been to. I have liked everything i have ordered and ive never had any trouble or disliked something. its pretty good!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for sushi I have had in the Phoenix area. Service is always great. I often get the Omakase Deluxe for lunch but they do have great rolls such as the Lotus on Fire and Las Vegas roll. I also really loved the seared tuna tataki. For appetizers I recommend the garlic edamame, tokyo quesadilla or the firecracker, which is spicy tuna mixed with tomatoes, onions and cilantro on wanton chips. The ambiance is nice and clean and presentation is beautiful."}
{"text":"They ended up comping my meal. That being said.   Almost 10 minutes from the time I was seated until I ordered. Almost 30 minutes until lunch box appeared which was almost 5 minutes after I told them I had to leave because after all, lunch breaks are only so long. Pity too, because the food looked really good. They offered to do to go, but tempura shrimp and vegis have a short shelf life.   The Ebi and Unagi were great as usual.   I'm going to have rethink this as a lunch destination if I don't have 2 hours to commit.  Today was indeed a disappointment, but overall I like this place, so it remains a 3.  BTW, my pick is of their lunch box, so maybe that is praise enough?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were here last week to have some sushi, but unfortunately we were disappointed. It was too cold and seemed prepared too quickly. She ended up getting sick right after as well. It's a shame, seemed like a nice Japanese restaurant. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ended up here randomly one weeknight for dinner. My friend and I were seated at the sushi bar. I don't expect the best service at the bar, but it was almost impossible to order a drink.  The decor was nice, but the sushi was overpriced and you didn't get a lot for what you paid for.   My biggest complaint was the sushi bar itself. It was too high and had tin foil blocking the display glass. I mean what is the point of sitting at the sushi bar if you can't see the sushi chef making the sushi.   I haven't eaten in the main part of the restaurant, but I would not recommend the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Great time, great food and great service. Sushi is expensive, but deal with it these men are artists hand crafting your food. Menu outside of sushi is great and fairly priced on most items. Only negative is that servers can be a little pushy with the alcohol."}
{"text":"I ordered the ahi tuna lunch bowl which came with rice and a cup of miso soup. The miso was a little too salty for my liking and the tuna bowl was filled with imitation crab rather than ahi tuna. The 3 or 4 chunks of ahi tuna that were present in my bowl did seem quite delicious. Although I was a little upset that I paid $12.00 for 3 chunks of tuna and a handful of imitation crab I'd give this place another shot. The service was great, the ambiance is very nice and some of the other menu items look incredible but they seem quite pricey compared to some of the other Japanese spots around town."}
{"text":"okay, food tasted average. i mean it didnt have that \"WOW\" factor. although, they have this KABUKI DELUXE : tempura chicken, grilled beef, salad, soup, shrimp tempura & vegetable tempura, and california rolls. All that for $13.00, pretty cheap huh? and on top of that.. between 3pm-5pm its happy hour ! so rolls and appetizers are like cut half off and beers and drinks are like $2 and up. so me and my boyfriend ended up staying for like 3 hours there .   other than the food, SERVICE was great. never had an empty cup and always had the server on top of her game refilling our drinks. DEFINITELY would recommend this place .. with their deals and the service , got me coming back for lunch time again and again :D"}
{"text":"In the past 3 years, we've visited family in Las Vegas 5 times.  In those 5 visits, we've eaten dinner at Kabuki 4 times.  The quality of the food is excellent.  Service is usually good.  We've only had one visit at Kabuki where service was below average.  Some of our orders were forgotten.  They accept reservations so if you're going with a party of 8 or more, I would suggest calling ahead.  They do get busy in the evening.  Price is a bit above average, but it is located in a shopping area.  My wife is a fan of the Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta.  I normally stick to the combo boxes...like the Premium Combination (Sashimi, Chicken Teriyaki and Mix Tempura) for $19.95.  I paid an extra $1 for having all Tuna Sashimi."}
{"text":"This place is consistently average. Nwver wows me but due to its location it gets some business. Service is great, its the food. Its not bad nor is it great. Theres just nothing that gives me that warm fuzzy feeling when i leave."}
{"text":"We came in to eat for our anniversary dinner and had Ashley as our server, she was very nice and kind! Great food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is hands down one of the best sushi places in town. The perfect meeting point of great quality and taste and reasonable prices. I personally love their cilantro albacore roll and lava roll but whenever I'm craving some deliciously warm food I go for their spicy seafood pasta- absolutely to die for!!! Of course though, great food is best accompanied by amazing service and our waiter Matthew was more than accommodating and went above and beyond with his amiable personality and wonderful suggestions. Last but not least the local menu specials are phenomenal- Sakura saketini... 10/10!"}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a quick dinner after a day of shopping and strolling around Town Square. There was a special for a squash soup outside and with the weather cooling down, I thought soup would be great. I was greeted right away and offered if I wanted to sit at the sushi table or bar. I went with the sushi table which are low set tables by the bar. Cozy and clean. Ordered the Albacore and Sunkissed roll and the Winter squash soup. The rolls were tasty, but average. The only thing that stood out to me was that the Sunkissed roll was a little spicy, but not much else. The squash soup was the highlight. It was creamy, rich and had a hint of paprika for heat. Maybe it just paired well with the cold weather outside, but I hope they make it a staple item in their menu. The hot tea was also decent.  The server was attentive and engaging. Checked on my drink levels and made sure everything was ok. I would come back for the friendly service and the soup for sure."}
{"text":"Swell sushi selection and pretty decent sized servings. The chop sticks are super cheap though?... random."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for lunch. Good service and good food.  Nice, clean atmosphere. Ordered the salmon and chicken lunch combo. The special comes with miso soup, salad, and your choice of rice. Missed the tempura vegetables you usually get at other spots but left full nonetheless."}
{"text":"It's the only restaurant I hadn't been to in Town Square because of the \"meh\" reviews and obviously Americanized menus. So, last night was my first visit and I'm impressed!  Our friends wanted to meet for Happy Hour (Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm) and I figured, why not? While everyone else ordered several small bottles of House Sake (hot) -- Sho Chiku Bai Extra Dry ($3.95; H/H $1.95) and Sapporo (pitcher: $17.95; H/H $9.50 and tower: $23.95; H/H $12.50) for sake bombs, two of us shared the Kabuki Signature Sake Sangria -- fresh fruits, sake, shochu, grapefruit and cranberry juices ($24.95; H/H $18.95) which yielded 5-6 large glasses.   For food, Ruben and I had two orders of Salmon Nigiri - which apparently they just call \"sushi\" ($4.25; H/H $2.95), two orders of Rose Roll -- shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber, and avocado ($9.95; H/H $6.95), and a Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll -- spicy tuna, tempura crumb, avocado and smelt roe ($7.95; H/H $5.95). Everything was really tasty. The salmon was so good, fresh, as I love how thick it was cut. Of the two specialty rolls, I really enjoyed the Rose Roll. Great flavor, nice balance of texture, and a little kick of spice. Also, the rolls are huge so you're definitely getting the value!  Service was great and everyone was really nice. Our server was awesome about letting us know when it was last call for Happy Hour. Also, everything arrived promptly even with them being pretty busy.  The Happy Hour prices are nice. It was the perfect way to try an a la carte sushi restaurant without breaking the bank. The fish quality was a pleasant surprise that instantly garnered respect. Not sure if I would pay the regular prices on the specialty rolls though. The selection is limited on the Happy Hour menu and there were many other intriguing rolls -- that weren't deep-fried or filled with cream cheese (pass on both) -- that I may want to try in the future.  So, based on my wonderful experience, I'd love to revisit and take advantage of their Happy Hours (Reverse Happy Hour is Mon-Thurs 9pm-closing and Sun 8pm-closing with similar menus)."}
{"text":"Me and my crew were hitting the late night showing of the Hangover tonight and we decided to grab dinner at Kabuki, which was a very good choice. Our group of 7 was seated near the sushi bar and our server quickly took our drink order and came back and took our app and meal orders. I had the california roll (crazy I know) and the mixed tempura appetizer, both of which were really good and not expensive at all (the food alone was ~$11). Add a drink and the tip and tax for a large group and it turned out to be a little pricy of a meal, but the restaurant has a really cool vibe and it was definitely an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Very good variety in the menu. Las Vegas roll and fiery dragon roll are the best."}
{"text":"The sushi chiefs (Jenny, Elda, Rafael and the other lady with the last three letter of her name tsa) do such a great job. Sushi is always fresh and made to order.  The server David did not do the best tonight taking care of the patrons in his section. David only visited the table twice during my whole visit once to finally refill my glass at the end of my meal and the other time to pay my bill.   Over all Kubuki has gone down hill. The menu has shrank substantially removing some of the best items Kubuki had to offer."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for about a year love the food always good. However, management is always slacking we have been there at all different times of the day during the week and weekends, they are also in desperate need of bus boys! Every single time i go even when it's slow they have a ton of dirty tables just waiting to be cleaned I've seen it on busy nights as well. They really need to get a better team together and move a little faster besides that everything is great."}
{"text":"The place, the food and especially the service and the attention of the SUSANA is the best, visit arizona for work, beautiful city and delicious sushi, next time I return arizona is 100% sure I return thanks to Susana very good recommendations, Thanks Susana!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience!! Will be back!! Very professional and appeasing to our EVERY need. Thank you Aaron!"}
{"text":"I've only been here one time my girlfriend was with some of her friends and said since I was shopping in the nearby Tommy Bahamas she tell me to stop in and have some sushi I wasn't in the mood since I was trying on bikinis in Tommy Bahama but I stopped in any way and I only ordered one role but it was a decent sushi restaurant my friends ordered multiple roles I just had one and a nice tea so I can't really say that much about this restaurant except that I know that a lot of locals do you like it and it has a good reputation It's the only sushi restaurant located in town Square so you have a lot of options for other types of restaurants but it's definitely not my favourite but if you are in the area and you are curious then I say definitely drop in Just remember it's located near the old Navy and the H&M I believe Can always asked for directions it easy to find Good for shoppers  Tourists locals"}
{"text":"The only thing that was less than perfect in the sushi is their choice of chopsticks which are little bit on the cheaper side,  other than that the service is outstanding the food is amazing, flawless. Their sushi is one of the freshest to sushi's I have tried in Arizona and you can say we have been around the block when it comes to sushi. We went as a group of eight and we were all very impressed with their drinks were great I personally love the lychee martini my husband Loved the mai tai. Very nice ambience and live there the core especially the red sofa!"}
{"text":"as soon as i walked in i laid eyes on something only a god can create and i'm an atheist. her hair was cut to her shoulders, reminded me of the waterfalls in the forest of New Zealand. i've personally never been to New Zealand but I swear i was there was there when i laid my eyes on her. she was wearing her black uniform which reminded me of a black hole because it took my breath away. i saw the windows of her soul through her glasses. the way she walked through the restaurant reminded me of a gazelle frolicking through the African savanna. her voice sounded like that of a hans zimmer score, majestic. as she walked me to my table i swear her beauty had me levitating. the whole time i was here i only thought of her. i never believed in love at first sight, but damn she made me question it. she made me question my whole existence. as i'm driving home right now on this rainy night, i swear i can see her face through the lighteninge. never did i imagine i would ever feel this way. i always thought tears were for sadness but today i realized that beauty can make tears run down my face. i don't know if u will ever get this, i might be typing this for nothing. but i will fall asleep tonight imagining u reading this and glaring at the same moon i'm looking at. for that moment we will be connected.   also, the food was great. the service was spectacular, i cannot wait to comeback."}
{"text":"It's great food, waiters are nice... But they serve less than you expect (but it's taste so good) and it's a little pricy...  They are too a little unorganized, I order 2 rolls my food got lost and had to wait a lot for the 2nd roll to come. My waiter didn't know if someone else bring the food for us or not"}
{"text":"Went here a few nights ago. We were there for happy hour. We ordered some salmon nigiri, a fried octopus and shrimp ball appetizer, gyoza, spicy tuna roll- all which were on the happy hour menu. We also ordered an albacore crunch roll -delicious! He had Sapporo and I had one of my faves, oyster bay sauv + another round. The server was friendly, the food was good and it was overall a pleasant dining experience. We left full and with a buzz for about $60 (before tip)."}
{"text":"I must have forgotten to write a (very bad) review about a year ago when I went with a decent sized group of girls and had horrendous service. I know one of the other girls wrote  review. So luckily I didnt give up. Kabuki has become a pretty regular place for us on Sunday, especially once we found out they have Happy Hour on weekends. We dont go to happy hour for drinks we go for the food. The specialty rolls are very tasty, the regular sushi rolls are as well. They have lunch meals that are more than enough to fill you up for a very affordable price"}
{"text":"Came here just after 9 for the reverse happy hour. The moment we were seated they told us it was last call for sushi..so we were a bit rushed. The rolls were very tasty but some were very loose. I guess the chef was in a hurry to go home? We were the last table in the place when they started with the whole..lets put chairs on tables. They even did that next to us which I thought was a bit much. So we rushed through our food and got outta there since they did not want us to linger. It was weird since I have been here before at that time and they never acted this way. I normally love this place."}
{"text":"Order a simple order of sesame chicken with white rice tonight to go....order took over an hour to be ready and what I received was definitely not sesame chicken and can only be described as well over fried something in what looks and smells to be overly old oil....with no sauce, the managers resolution to this problem, after trying to tell me that I must be wrong because this was and I quote \" their new sesame chicken\" was to offer us a credit the next time we came to the restaurant but as far as my sons supper tonight...we would have to figure that out on our own....gee thanks!"}
{"text":"This was a nice stop for happy hour discounts during lunch hours (I'm not sure if it extends to weekends) and good food.  The ambiance is nice and there's an outdoor dining patio. My waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because they don't offer an option for steamed or grilled vegetables.  They only have tempura vegetables on the menu... strange.  I decided to try the tempura vegetables and didn't really like them. However, the teriyaki chicken and rice was yummy.  The sauce was sweet,  savory and not too heavy. The meal also came with a ginger salad,  which was fresh and delicious. I liked that the portion sizes were large for the price. I had leftovers for dinner. You really get a good value for your money here."}
{"text":"Service was good. When we came in as a party of 5, they said \"yes\" and cleared a table and that took a total of about 7 minutes.   Then we were served drinks and all that. I ordered the tonkatsu, tempura and onigiri (rice ball with salmon inside). I didn't eat the onigiri because I gave them to my friends. But they said it was good and I trust them. The tonkatsu was good enough and so was the tempura. I'd go back again for a quick meal. The only problem was the price. It was way too expensive to justify it's cost."}
{"text":"Here is the first awful restaurant that compelled me to write a review, its from another website before I found this one. It's back from Nov. 2008 so who knows if things have changed, but me thinks not as to what I have heard..This restaurant was the worst I have been to for the price::   I usually never write reviews of restaurants unless I am moved to do so. My experience here was not pleasant and mistake after mistake compelled me. First off, I am a chef at a respectable restaurant in Tempe. I have also waited tables before at many restaurants. Our server completely forgot my drink order, I ignored that and just decided to forget about it. My cousin got an appetizer of mushrooms and other sauteed veggies that was pretty bland. What completely upset me is that our server brought out our sushi, teriyaki chicken and salads at the same time! So while I'm trying to enjoy my sushi my entree is getting cold and my salad was warm because it is plated next to the chicken. The albacore I got seemed to be seared on the edges, which isn't mentioned on menu, but it was very dry, not stored correctly. My philly roll was disgusting, I had to send it back The first time I had ever sent anything back. It just tasted not fresh and premade. My server didnt seem to care, not even a sorry, but a \"that's weird our fish is fresh everyday\", well it dont taste like it people! Also server had completely forgotten my soup, I had to remind twice, then finally ask for it to go(reminded again after the bill came). My teriyaki chicken was dry and the sauce wasn't so good, the sauce I requested to make it spicy was pretty unappetizing(My server forgot that too, had to remind) (maybe she was stoned?) I think Kyoto Bowl has better Spicy Teriyaki Chicken and even Ra has better sushi(crazy but true)  I wish I could say my drink was good, but alas! I NEVER got it.  ( I kept waiting and wouldn't say anything just to see if she remembered) I wouldn't waste my time here if you want good japanese food and sushi. Go to Ichiban, Sapporo, Stingray, Sushi Brokers, etc. This place blows! PLEASE PLEASE Tempe Marketplace get one GOOD restaurant here!"}
{"text":"Vibe is cool. Service is good. Food was good. Tokyo mule was refreshing. If it was included on the happy hour menu, I'd probably have two or three of them."}
{"text":"Melody was such a lovely hostess, the staff is wonderful! Dominic was great as well :)"}
{"text":"Loved my meal here (lunch).  Had the chicken terriyaki w/Shrimp Tempura and California roll lunch special.  Food very tasty and service was excellent.  Loved the decor inside the place.  Not your typical Japanese restaurant look.  Would highly recommend.  Other family members dishes were equally as good (my kid loved the Tongkatsu)."}
{"text":"Of all the Japanese places I've eaten this has got to be the worst.   No taste to the crab rolls were tasteless but the warm kale salad was decent..... Very pricy..... Not recommended"}
{"text":"Really good food and amazing service. Loving the iced green tea"}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour when you're craving Japanese food but not sushi. That being said, I only go here for the happy hour menu. There are a ton of other places in town where I can get my AYCE sushi fix.   My all time favorite love here is their spicy tuna salad. Fresh spring mix dressed with a soy vinagarette and topped with a giant ball of spicy tuna. Broiled mussels on a half shell are drenched in sweet, rich mayo sauce are also good. The fried calamari rings come with two types of dipping sauces, teriyaki or creamy mustard. Fried sesame chicken bites also come with a teriyaki dipping sauce. Can't go wrong with a Philadelphia roll or any other simple roll like salmon skin. Their specialty rolls have too much going on for my taste so I stay away from them. Lastly you gotta try the cucumber mint mojito or two or three. Sake is pretty cheap for happy hour price too. I always leave here feeling overly stuffed with fried, fatty goodness."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, we were greeted by a friendly manager and seated us.  Place  was clean, was not that busy yet since we walked in when they just open. The food here is affordable and good food.They have lunch specials too.  Beef teriyaki was so tender and tastety. Cooked perfectly.  Our server Luis was informative, attentive and friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Always love going to Kabuki.  Dined here at the TS location prior to going to see a movie at the AMC Theaters. For a Saturday night, the location was not too busy, which was very surprising to say the least, We were seated within 5 minutes. Upon being served, our server (Don't remember his name) kindly gave us our drink orders, edamame on the side to snack on, and took our order in a timely fashion.  I tried a new menu item in the pork belly bun. It was a deconstructed siopao for those familiar with Asian cuisine. It looked almost like an Asian taco, full of flavor as well. I also ordered the sunkissed roll, which contained salmon and avocado. I also ordered the California roll with baked scallops as well. We also ordered the  lotus roll on the side, and an order of their fried and grilled calamari.  Food came out very, very quickly, within 10 minutes of ordering. Our server even applauded our choice when we ordered the grilled calamari and the sunkissed roll. Some of the best flavors I have tasted.  Overall, I loved the ambiance and the decor of the place. I also loved the quality and the freshness of all the food that we ordered. I loved the attentiveness of the workers as well, and we even got a 10% discount for being LVAC members.  Highly recommend this location. Great food, amazing service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here for an early lunch for the first time and it was rather good. First of all their menu is expansive, covering just about everything you could want from a restaurant specializing in Japanese food. Everything from your traditional sushi and sashimi to ramen to their take on takoyaki. We ordered a combination plate consisting of sashimi, teriaki chicken, rice, salad, miso soup, and tempura as well as the takoyaki, fresh water eel sushi, and some kind of roll the waiter suggested.   Everything was pretty delicious, all of the sauces had good flavor and the rice was well cooked with just the right amount of stick. The chicken was a tad overdone but the sauce and the somewhat smoky flavor made up for that. The sashimi was of course, off in texture (being frozen due to location which is completely understandable) and also was a bit oddly sliced; they were a bit too thick, at least for my taste. But the quality of the fish was nice. Their take on takoyaki (Soy Tako Ebi Yaki) was very good, the crisp soy paper wrapper being a good choice to offset the chew of the shrimp and octopus (both excellently cooked), I think it was my favorite part of the meal. The salad, miso soup, and tempura were all good but nothing to really write home about. The eel was very good with just the right amount of sauce. The roll the waiter suggested was not my favorite although my sister enjoyed it. It consisted of crab, rice, tuna, and another fish I can't recall set on top of siracha, japanese mayo and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. The roll itself was good but the sauce was completely overkill for me. It could have absolutely done with a much milder hot sauce if any were to be put on it; the siracha really took away from the flavor of the other sauces and almost completely masked the fish. I wouldn't order it again.   The ambiance is nice, the waitstaff seemed knowledgeable, friendly and attentive and the seating areas inside and out were clean and aesthetically pleasing. The interior was a bit warm but I assume that is just because they had just opened when we arrived.   Over all I will be back again."}
{"text":"Happy Hour!! Love the Beer, Rolls, and prices! A very tasty spot. Always busy on the weekends, so I'm a fan of the Mon-Thurs scene. Speedy and Responsive staff. Great food. Im so stoked to have a fav sushi spot near home = awesome!"}
{"text":"The location its huge. They have an outdoor option for eating.  As soon as I got there they got a table for me and my hustband. The table wasn't very clean thought. And the waiter did not seem to care about it.  The decorations are contenporary and dark. They have a beautiful wine wall. I tried the tuna and it was ok. The miso soup tasted really bad. My hustband got the Bbq ribs and those put a honest smile on my face. They tasted GREAT, incluiding the asian salad. There is a lot to try in this place. It has a big menu. The waiter was good."}
{"text":"Ok for the two times I've been here. Once was for take out and another for dine in. It's like walking into a neo tokyo pop art museum. Seriously...the bar is pretty small. Bartender was a rookie. I wasn't too impressed. Oh you wanna talk about food. Yummmm the Spicy tuna was.....spicy tuna....the calamari was....fried calamari.....Oh yea and the grilled yellowtail collar was....grilled yellowtail collar. Ok so everything tasted like it should. Not completely out of this world or mind blowing. And yes I was the jerk that ordered the strawberry green tea with the mint. Combine two drinks in one. And it took them forever to actually interpret that. Believe me my engrish is good. Yes the service was very very ahem Cheery. I mean if it was any more sweeter I'd be in yogurtland."}
{"text":"I love this place! Sushi always coming fresh and fast :) Clean place with a good customer service, waitress took enough care about us and also didn't bother with a question \"how is everything\" every five minutes like some places. Definitely coming back with another friends!"}
{"text":"Kabuki roll is awesome! My only suggestions would be a little bit better quality chop sticks, and fresh wasabi!"}
{"text":"I found the food quite good and the service prompt (mostly) and willing to please. Sushi chefs were easy to order from and helpful. Food was over priced: 1 special roll, 1 nigiri sushi, 1 beer and happy hour appetizer was $35. If that is ok with you, then I think you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Having eaten Japanese food in Japan, Seattle, Little Tokyo I know I had to lower my expectations about eating here. Service is nice but the food is just ok."}
{"text":"So I tried this place without consulting yelp first. Mistake. The sushi quality wasn't the best and the rolls were a bit loose, which other yelpers have stated too. I'm even more disappointed now to see that they have a reverse happy hour after 9. Maybe its not on Wednesdays but I was there after 9 & no happy hour was mentioned and nothing was discounted on our bill. I'm in Town Square at least once a week & love sushi, too bad this wasn't better."}
{"text":"Veggie menu is awesome!  I highly recommend it  Great menu selection very fresh and tasty plus they have happy hour specials which not all of our many sushi spots do.  Pleased!"}
{"text":"Kabuki is one of the classic sushi places in Las Vegas. My favorite dish here has to be the gold rush, because I LOVE tempura!!!  Of course their sushi is good here and the service is really good too. The food came out quickly and the servers were really kind. Our drinks were always refilled without having to flag one of the staff down.   My friends and I were really lucky to walk in during Happy Hour, and surprisingly it wasn't even that busy. No complaints for me though because the food was cheaper and the food came out fast!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in vegas. so fresh, so delicious. from the sushi to the entrees to the salads... all amazing! Only thing that wasn't delish was the garlic edamame, the garlic was burnt. But that was the only negative. Everything else was AMAZING! I had a favorite sushi spot back home in San Diego, but this one beats it, hands down! Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at the sushi bar since there was no wait.  Once we were seated, they brought us an ample serving of complementary edamame.    I ordered the cucumber salad (which needed more ponzu sauce or something just a tad sweeter--too much sesame oil), the sweet shrimp, and the sunkissed roll.  My sushi was excellent.  Service was good, but don't except a verbal exchange with the sushi chefs--they are all business.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi - not as crazy about the traditional dining - but definitely of our favorite spots for local sushi!"}
{"text":"Lunch time in the city and I'm feeling Japanese - I really think so.  Kabuki Japanese Restaurant isn't so bad. Yeh, it's a chain but where else would I be able to enjoy a meal of vegetarian variety that I look forward to when dining out? Kabuki's menu is extensive and the vegetarian selections are clearly marked.  Authentic restaurants may have extensive menus too, but they just don't understand non-meat living. Soooo, folks who want authenticity should stay away. In fact, just skip this review entirely because it ain't for you.  Lunch for four at Kabuki wasn't expensive at all, and I walked away with a satisfied palate and filled tummy. A small house salad, side of ginger, and wasabi accompanied the meal. Love that tasty ginger! It was ginger-coloured and marinated just right; not the pink-overly-sweetened-pickled-store-bought stuff. I topped everything with it and had to ask for an extra serving.  Here's the food I decided on:  - Spicy Veggie Ramen  This was good. Spicy broth with noodles, kale, onions, and bean sprouts. The noodles were a nice texture and very long. The amount of kale was perfect, but still the soup was lacking something filling. Like mushrooms. I would have loved to have some mushrooms. - Sautéed Asparagus  Comes in teriyaki sauce. Great sauce! Take this sauce and mix with the ginger...oh yeah. That's how you do condiments. - Sweet Potato Fries  Who's a sucker for fries? Meeee. I would probably order fries in a candy store if I could. - Steamed Vegetables  Small plate of steamed kabocha (a type of squash), mushroom, asparagus, red bell pepper, broccoli, and green beans. Hmmmm, now that I think of it I should have put these into my ramen. That would have made a proper bowl of soup. - Vegetable Tempura My Japanese staple. Crunchy and not too oily. - Asparagus Rolls and Avocado Rolls  These were good, but I would not order the asparagus again because it didn't do anything for the taste of the roll. The avocado roll had  a much better bite in terms of texture and the way the tastes melded."}
{"text":"The hostess was not friendly, the patio tables were too close together, and at least four servers walked right by a pair of dirty chopsticks lying on the ground on the patio without picking them up.  The tempura breading was thin and tasteless, and for a $15 entree was seriously lacking in vegetables.  I mean how much would it have costed them to double the vegetables from 5 to 10?  30 cents.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"Kabuki is a fantastic place to get pretty authentic Japanese sushi - it is one of the few places our Japanese friends like to go! I regularly go there for happy hour - they have a pretty good selection of drinks, appetizers, and sushi. Some of the items I regularly get are the mozzarella tempura, the firecracker, gyoza, and the bbq beef ribs. Their dinners are also good - bento boxes are the best! The only reason why I can't give Kabuki 5 stars is due to their service. We go there a lot and it's really hit or miss with the servers - some are great, others are so-so."}
{"text":"We came across this location as we looked for food near our hotel.  It was a great location located within a shopping district, with multiple vegan friendly rolls to choose from."}
{"text":"I live in Seattle, in the middle of the international district.  I came here with my husband tonight wanting something refreshing after a few days of fast food.  I was nervous to come here.  I don't want to sound like a snob, but I have been very blessed sushi-wise with the location I live in.  Or favorite place actually goes out and catches its fish every day, and when they run out, they stop serving.  So, needless to say, I was doubtful about sushi in a state where there's no ocean anywhere near.  But this was rather lovely!  I would be happy to come back again."}
{"text":"Went there for my sons birthday, have been there on many occasions. Weekday night, average busy. My daughter and I stood at the hostess stand while 4-yes 4 hostesses stood there talking to one another and looking at an ipad thing etc. Nobody acknowledged us-we literally stood there 5+ minutes without anyone even looking up or saying hi. We finally went past them to look for the rest of our party and sat ourselves without them saying a thing. Got to our party, no silverware or place settings. My son said they had been there over 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged them.  After our server finally came over everything was spot on. Food came out correct, timely, drinks were kept full etc. 100% great service from our server. When we left....again no acknowledgement from the hostess stand.... not a stellar first or last impression. I think ultimately you pay alot of money for atmosphere and presentation. I don't know that hte amount of food you get is worth the money exception being the kids meals. Those are well worth it. The rest, meh-over priced and under portioned. Tastes good though.,.so.."}
{"text":"I want to say that I have had the best waiter experience of my life and surprisingly is not a Forbes restaurant, but Kabuki. I would like to consider myself a foodie and one of my favorites is sushi, Uni sashimi is my favorite and I have travel extensively to find good and fresh Uni Sashimi. This is truly by far the best uni I have had, and I have to say the portions are very generous compared to other sushi bars. As far as my waiting staff, JP is the best.  He greeted us shortly after being seating and immediately took our drink order. He came immediately back with two waters with lemon and proceeded to take our food order. I could not believe how more attentive he could get, but he surely exceeded my expectations and pleasantly tried to go above and beyond his service. He ensured all food we ordered was prepared to our liking, and continued to come and check on drinks and kept our water filled. He brought us extra ginger and wasabi since both my husband and I love both. We were truly impressed with JD's service and additionally his very professional and pleasant manager, Zhen. This manager took the time to check in with us and ensure our food, service and experience was a perfect one. Thank you so much to both. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Dinner started off great and then was just downhill from there.  We spend $70 on meal that we wouldn't have spent $20 on.  The prices listed online are a lot less than what are actually in the restaurant.  The cucumber mojito and garlic edemame were the highlight of the dinner.  Service was so-so, very standard like somebody had mentioned below.    Garlic Edemame: Phenomenal (best plate we had) Regular Edemame: Cold and tasteless Halibut Sushi:  Taste like it was a week old and really fishy Yellowtail Sushi:  Tough and stringy Rose Roll:  Average at best Chicken Sukiyaki:  Horrible Apple Tart: Plate came and my boyfriend and I said \"that's it!?\" at the same time...was average tasting"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had!! Lotus, bscr, and  spicy tuna roll were fantastic! Great service and a good atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went there with friend last Friday, around 12 pm. Asked for a booth, to what hostess replied that they are not available and seated a tiny square table. When we asked the server, Tina, if we could be seated to the booth, she mumbled that it was not possible. During our visit, there were at least FIVE unoccupied booths.   We were so hungry, so we decided to stay. Got two Kabuki Deluxe lunch sets for which we had to wait for a long time. Marinated beef was okay, not the very best I've tried. In the menu, it contained \"shrimp and vegetable tempura\", I wish I knew that it means only one piece of shrimp tempura. Tempura was overly greasy and tasteless, both shrimp and vegetables.  Service was horrible, and not only because of the seating. Server was saying something to us and leaving before heard the response. She didn't even ask if we needed forks and knives for meat and salad!"}
{"text":"Always love the service, fast reliable. Always come here for the presentation and how good the food is of course. And the happy hour I can't complain I always spend under 20 dollars at least unless I'm very hungry. Sake bombers are a plus, if you are craving a drink, or Vegas Rolls & Spicy tuna/Crunch is a thing I always order when I  come here. Many options to choose from on the happy hour menu, and good drinks at reasonable costs, also there's a good lunch menu time and such."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Good food, but definitely had better sushi. Not a very hospitable environment. Host was cold and pissed off. Server was OK. They just seemed like they don't want to be there, which really brings down the atmosphere. Not on my list of restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi .. we stopped by for a late lunch /early dinner knowing we didn't have to go back to work..  We split the veggie & shrimp tempura to start.. yummy .. lightly fried .. had the spicy tuna rolls .. classic roll (my fav), the rainbow roll so colorful and fresh.. the lava roll my daughter picked because of the pic in the menu.. it did not disappoint.. loved the lightly fried jalapeño ring on top..   As if we didn't have enough food.. we also split the green tea cheesecake .. creamy good and that jam on the plate played off the cheesecake well. It looks like a small portion but it's rich and a small slice goes a long way ..  Always a great place to catch up with friends and eat great fresh food!"}
{"text":"The pricing is a bit high for the quality of meat they use. I didnt expect the freshest and best meat to be used - but I did expect quality for the price they were asking.  The rest of the dish was great though.   The service was very wonderful and attentive.   Thumbs down on the disposable chopsticks.   This place was neither here nor there and I can not say I will remember this place in a week one way or another."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here and they have a pretty good happy hour. I have to say its the number one place I go to at Westgate."}
{"text":"Yum. The staff were a lot of fun and were very accommodating when we went, even though it was the dinner rush on a rainy weekend night.   The food was delicious and came in good portions. The atmosphere and decor was nice, even though I did not care for their restroom's design (tilted walls that made very little sense to me)."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for lunch and sat at the Sushi bar. We were immediately greeted by the Sushi Chef and our waiter was soon over.  We ordered the lunch special which is one kind of roll and a variety of sushi. We both had the \"spicy tuna\" rolls and also added the tofu rolls. I wasn't a huge fan of the tofu rolls as I felt they were bland and kind of mushy. My husband liked them though.  The lunch special also came with a salad which was very good. The Sushi was fresh, I wasn't sure what some of it was but it was good, not great though."}
{"text":"Personally, I feel this specific location is under staffed which could be the only logical explanation why there is always bad service during busy hours.  I found that even during slower hours the staff forgets about tables. I've noticed that they have had \"now hiring\" sign for some time now too.  To add, the sushi is very expensive and at most right below average for the average roll count and freshness. For this reason, I opt out of sushi.  I do highly recommend all of their ramen dishes. Specifically, the spicy miso ramen. The portion is big enough for two. Their option to add an extra side is also a great deal. I typically pair with the gyoza dumplings.  Overall, if you are looking for a great out of this world sushi this is not the place for you. If you don't want to spend at least $50 dollars on 4 plates of sushi, this is not the place for you. And if you are expecting to have great service for the money you spend this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"The sashimi portions were large, but not as fresh as I would expect, especially being for a local place (not near the strip).  I rated it a three because it wasn't busy at all and the service was slow."}
{"text":"Not my kind of place. The food is wayyy too weird and taste even weirder. I sat at the bar. I had already told the female bartender that I don't drink. What does that fool do? She serves / gives me a drink! WTH? Are you kidding me? I just told you I don't drink. I think she was trying to get me to loosen up but I was fine until she did that - that pissed me off. I was polite to the little girl who should have known better. I left early only cuz I was not feeling this place, I preferred other sushi places. I most likely will never be back."}
{"text":"Dined here recently on a date. I really enjoyed the ambiance and there happy hour was a hit. So many good choices! I loved my cucumber mojito it was nice to try something other then the usual mint. There beers are really good priced too. They have a huge selection on the HH menu, unlike most places that are very limited. I loved the rolls were ordered, the dynamite roll was my favorite. They also serve this cute tiny saki bottle over ice which is adorable. Our server was nice too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"No wonder this place has such poor ratings. Came in on Thursday night around 8pm.  There are about 3-4 tables inside and 6 tables outside unoccupied and available.  Yet, the hostesses with attitude as if they work at a high end place like Sushi Roka Akor or Tiffani's, make you wait 25-30 min to make the restaurant appear as if they are busy. Just because you are rated subpar (but 1 star higher than the rest of the mediocre restaurants around it) and the nearest good quality restaurants are 20-25 minutes away does not mean the service has to be this pathetic and rude. In regards to food, the menu is quiet extensive with beautiful pictures of sushi, sashimi, rolls, and other dishes.  The food comes out looking nothing like they appear on the menu. Ordered grilled squid, salmon tower, tuna poke, tuna tartare, sashimi platter, and variety of sushi. Quality of fish mediocre to average (low grade, farmed). The appetizers were horrendous in presentation and taste. Don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here about once per month! We really enjoy the outdoor seating in Tempe marketplace. They have great drink selections with the flavored margaritas being particularly delicious.  As a non-seafood fan, there is plenty on the menu that I can eat. I love the sesame chicken (it's got a great kick to it) and I love the california tempura roll. They give you a side of edamame free when you order sushi.  My husband is slightly more adventurous and likes the Dynamite roll.  We've also had the seaweed salad and enjoyed that. Definitely will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be my last. Awesome customer service as well as their food I had the kabuki deluxe which had teriyaki chicken bbq ribs assorted tempura three California sushi miso soup mixed salad and a bowl brown rice for only 13.95  very reasonable!   Will definitely have to make it a must to eat here on every Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Definitely great customer service but i did not find the striking jap cuisine taste in here..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to in TS, mainly during happy hour. I don't really drink though.. Just go here to get my sushi fix! Loooove the mussels and Vegas roll!  If you are going with a group you might wanna try their boat.. it's a little bit of everything!"}
{"text":"Sushi was so-so, the wine list wasn't anything to make me want to go back.  They seemed to have a lot of interesting looking cocktails but I prefer wine with my sushi.  We weren't in a rush so I can't really comment of the sense of urgency for the service staff.  He seemed to be around when we needed him so that's a plus right there. The restaurant itself was clean and in good shape.  I just wasn't impressed with the sushi and the rolls at all."}
{"text":"Kabuki is fantastic. On the levels of quality and price you're getting an absolute steal. I'm not really an authority on sushi but I have a passion for its aesthetics and preparation as well as Japanese cuisine in general. From what I've had here, I can say that Kabuki is an incredibly decent establishment that far surpasses a two to three star rating. I only give it four because a 5 star rating would indicate something completely without flaws (which I will get into).  First off, you can eat like KINGS during the happy hours. Reverse happy hour is a better because you can basically buy one cheap roll ($4) and get one for $1. 6-8$ appetizers (yummy and hearty proportions) and voila, get one for $1. I highly recommend the calamari appetizer!  The sushi is delicious. Preparation and presentation are top-notch (especially for the price you're getting it at) You have beautiful surroundings, GREAT and FRIENDLY service, and artfully crafted sushi served with all the fixings you could ever want.  The desserts are delicious (I recommend the green tea ice cream) and very reasonably priced. The membership plan is genius. Service is never lacking and even in rush hours I get fantastic, friendly, and knowledgeable service.  The only problems I see with this place would perhaps be that, while (most) sushi is delicious, cheap, and prepared quickly, sometimes certain rolls can be hit or miss. A small flaw, but one that should be mentioned.  Everyone has different tastes but I've had sushi here (and I really love food from all over) that just didn't click with me for reasons ranging from texture to overall taste. Again, you can't love everything from any one place so my advice to really get what you know what you'll love. Being adventurous with sushi in general is risky business.  To add, Japanese cuisine and sushi isn't for everyone. I can see from a lot of these reviews that people are giving Kabuki low ratings because this is their first time eating sushi and are unfamiliar with the motions of Japanese cuisine in all. I say to disregard reviews like that because it really involves a mature and open-minded range of taste and acceptance to truly appreciate sushi. Yes, it's probably not the best sushi out there but it's better than average and definitely not \"bad\". Kabuki is fantastic in my book and in a one month period of living in Scottsdale, I've eaten there four glorious times."}
{"text":"I went about trying that happy hour I mentioned a while back. The prices were happy for Westgate, I suppose, but still about the same as many other sushi bars throughout the valley.  That awesome saketini I raved about last time? It no longer exists! I tried to fill that gap with the cucumber Tokyo mojito and the lychee lime martini, but they just can't compare to my first love. Don't get me wrong, I'll knock back plenty of those perfectly balanced mojitos. But the martini? I appreciate using lychee in drinks, but the bitterness of the shochu vodka makes it a drink I'll only enjoy because of the lychee pulp. At $5.50 each, don't think your hour will be happy if you and a buddy have too many.  The sesame chicken was good after the first few bites, but just too darn greasy for me. Tough to finish. The rolls available are all below par, and that rose roll was disgusting! I know spicy tuna isn't the best sushi filling, but not only did it suck, the way it was just slathered on made me roll my eyes.  Along with that mojito (I'm guilty of craving one), the nigiri is some of the better stuff I had. The albacore was neat and delicious--but at $3 a pop (Okay...$2.95), I don't think it provides the push to boost this place into 3-star territory.  I'll inevitably be back with people that don't know any better, or just love Westgate in general. And I'll keep checking in. Don't let it go to your head!"}
{"text":"Great selection, good service. Recommend the sake sangria, spicy tofu on crispy rice & lotus roll"}
{"text":"I only come here for happy hour. I don't think their regular menu is that impressive nor would I pay the full price. I've only been to this location a couple times. Tivoli Village is so pretty.. I hope business picks up for them. The best place to park is in the underground garage and keep going far back towards Rampart... so when you get off the elevator you're right by Kabuki~!!!    Some of my must haves: --Spicy Tuna Salad: comes on a bed of shredded cucumbers, daikon and gobo.. mmm light and refreshing. --Fire Cracker: Spicy tuna with cilantro & onions served with fried wonton crackers! --Calamari: It's deep fried! Of course it's good! --Philly roll with no cream cheese: The cut of salmon is big.. yummm  --Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream: Not on HH but worth the $   --Love the complimentary edamame  The service has always been really nice and fast. If you're looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant.. don't come here. It's Korean owned and very \"Americanized...\"  HOT TIP: Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program.. It's free and you get a gift certificate on your birthday ;]]]"}
{"text":"This place brings back memories of high school! This used to be on our list of spots we would frequent. I only come here for happy hour. I don't think their regular menu is that impressive nor would I pay the price. Their happy hour used to be larger and have even more items and better rolls but it's still a good bang for your buck! We still have Kabuki in our rotation of HH's the only difference now it that we also get to take advantage of their sake specials HEHE   Some of my must haves: --Spicy Tuna Salad: comes on a bed of shredded cucumbers, daikon and gobo.. mmm light and refreshing. --Fire Cracker: Spicy tuna with cilantro & onions served with fried wonton crackers! --Calamari: It's deep fried!

{"text":"Sunny Sunday afternoon.  You know what that means.  Time for a family outing.  We ended up at Town Square and unfortunately there just aren't too many quality restaurants there.    The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated right away.  I ordered a salmon teriyaki lunch combo and hubby got the miso ramen.  Bleh.  Bland.  From the salmon to the tempura, nothing stood out.  It was kind of...tasteless.  Hubby's ramen was super salty.  What we had did not inspire me to try their sushi or really anything else.    And service?  Lackluster.  Despite the emptiness of the restaurant, she wasn't around much and you had to really flag her down if you wanted something.    Not worth it."}
{"text":"Well, it seems not everything here is as delicious as I had hoped it would be.  The ramens are all just OKAY.  They taste like ramen you make at home and the chashu is not melt in your mouth delicious.  I still love this place and can't wait to try OTHER things."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  It's a trendy - hip kind of environment decorated very deco-shiek.  Not sure how else to describe it....the inside looks like a sculpture.  I'll have to snap some pictures when I'm there next.  I started with Miso soup which was pretty traditional and nothing to write home about. Same with the edemame. As far as those two things are concerned, its pretty hard to mess them up - lol.   The next course we did some sushi. I got a couple Maguro and can't remember the roll. They have such a large variety of rolls. There is definitely something for everyone on the menu. The Maguro was cut unusually thick for sushi. I had a hard time consuming it. Don't get me wrong, I love tuna but the concept behind sushi is one...maybe two bites. This was more like 4.   Next, I had the Koshou chicken. It was spicy and sweet...a great blend of flavors...served over a sticky rice. On the side were shitake mushrooms and asparagus. I wish I were able to describe this dish better. It was so good that I cant imagine going to Kabuki and not ordering it.   I was there during an off time 3:00 pm so service was exceptional. Not surprising since there were only a handful of people in the restaurant. I had to go back to work so didn't have a chance to sample any saki.....which there is a large variety. If you plan to go more than once, you can sign up for their \"club\" on line which gives you discounts and free meals once you accrue enough points. I am taking one star away for how the sushi was cut. Other than that, this place is incredible."}
{"text":"Absolutely great service, food/rolls came out quick, drinks were great, everyone was friendly & restaurant is real nice. I highly recommend this place especially if you're in Town Square. The Lotus Roll is SOOO good! It's a baked roll & it came nice & warm. And it was just oh so delicious! We also had the Albacore roll (yum), The Lotus on Fire roll (it was okay) & the Lobster Croquettes (it was okay).   I usually have dessert but I was so full from dinner.   Will definitely come back! They have great happy hours too. And a cook bar & lounge area. Love this place."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to vist this Shushi bar on Sunday when they were not to busy. The Staff was very friendly and services was quick. Order two or three rolls and cumcumber salad it was enough to fill two people up. Prices are fair for Shushi."}
{"text":"Their las vegas roll doesn't even have salmon in it. I ordered it expecting the usual salmon, cream cheese, avocado etc., but it had krab meat instead of salmon. It was quite an expensive roll for only having krab and no real fish. They only had green tea latte and no other milk teas and it tastes like melted ice cream."}
{"text":"I guess they were okay for a CHAIN, in a MALL.  Service was quick and even gave us free endame, I know, that's not much but it's something.  Just had a few rolls all of which were fine.  3 of the 4 rolls were about the size as a coffee cup, way too big for a humans mouth.  So what's a person do with rolls that are too big?  Do you:   A) Push the entire roll in you pie-hole and hope no food falls out when you start chewing. B) Cut up the roll with a knife and fork. C) Use your chopsticks to pick apart the roll into small bite size portions.  Have your answer ready before you visit this place."}
{"text":"I give it five stars for the quality of the food especially the freshest sushi I've ever had and the excellent service each time I visit Las Vegas I will be sure to come back here!"}
{"text":"A small group of us went here to eat several weeks ago... they weren't so busy that there was a wait, but the table we wanted outside was still dirty. We were tired and starving so we sat down anyway after they promised to have it cleaned straight away.  20 minutes later, nobody had offered to take our drink order, but we managed to get someone to take most of the disgusting plates off of our table. We had asked a few people to send someone out to take our order and the table next to us that had been seated after us had gotten menus and drinks.   They must've not understood that we were new customers even though the hostess knew, the waiter whos section it was new, and the bus boy and bartender both knew as well because we told them. I guess the filthy plates of half-eaten food and slime were tricking them.   The five of us sat there trying to talk over the sounds of our gurgling stomachs as we waited for about a half hour without menus, drinks or any indication we were going to get served... finally, an off-duty employee came out and asked us if we had been served. We said no and that we were leaving and he flipped out. He said he wasn't on the clock so he couldn't help us, but he would try to flag someone down immediately.  In the end, the place smelled very fishy (which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi) and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere. Between the fishy smell and the non service, there wasn't much keeping us there.  The place looked kinda nice and I'm sure we just had an isolated experience - but until I actually try again and get some food and service, this will have to be my review - one star. If the place had been ultra packed, I might have forgiven this a little more."}
{"text":"Decided to come in after a long day of shopping. Came in with my boyfriend, as we entered the hostess nicely greeted us and we had Tim who was very genuinely friendly.  Tim has to be one of the best server I've ever had in a dining experience. He was very knowledgeable on the menu, his recommendations were on point! He never left our glasses half empty, was always checking up on us to make sure we loved every dish we ordered. Everything at kabuki is amazing and fresh. My new fav spot! If anyone wants a great experience, Tim is the guy!"}
{"text":"I love the restaurant!! They do get pretty busy so be ready to wait a little while if you go during a popular time. The food is amazing and the wait staff is always super friendly and willing to offer suggestions from the menu!"}
{"text":"Okay, I admit, I was hesitant at first with the idea of hitting up Kabuki.  But since I've been making my rounds for happy hour, I was told that I have to check this place out!  Their happy hour is Monday through Friday, from 3 pm to 6 pm; includes discounted drinks and food.  Drinks are hard to miss on their menu because it dominates the first few pages.  I started off with:  * Tokyo Mojitos \"Made from Asian Vodka \"Shochu\" and Sake\" (HH $4.95 / $7.95 reg), the Berry flavor.  When I took a sip, oh my goodness, wow!  This was one damn good mojito!  I had the Husband and another friend try it, and they were sold immediately!  The Husband got the Grapefruit variety, while our friend got a Berry one too.  I also tried the Lychee one later on.  I'm not usually a fan of fresh grapefruit, but it reminded me more of grapefruit soda and I liked it too, better than the Lychee one.  * Draft beer (Kirin Ichiban) (HH $1.95 / reg $3.50) - The guys did get beer to start, but soon moved on to mojitos!  I had planned on trying one of their Chu-Hi \"Made from Asian Vodka 'Shochu' with Refreshing Fruit Flavor\" drinks, specifically the Blueberry flavor (HH $4.95 / reg $6.95), but got stuck on the mojitos!  Oh well, next time!  Foodwise:  I had to ask first, do they use sriracha in their hot sauce?  (I'm not a fan of it in my sushi.)  And thank goodness, no!  I was all aboard!  * Spicy Tuna Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $4.75) - My staple, as long as I like the hot sauce and I like it here.  Yum.  * Lotus on Fire Roll \"Spicy Tuna, Lotus Root, and Jalapeno on top of California roll\" (HH $5.95 / reg $9.95) - This was beautifully presented with a deep-fried lotus root sitting on each piece, complete with a jalapeno slice.  There's also some spicy crunchy things on one side and more hot sauce on the other side.  It's a pretty tasty roll with a lot of heat, so good that we ordered another roll!  * Salmon Skin Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $3.95) - Served with six pieces, the bonito flakes add a nice smokey taste to it.  It was good.  * Aladdin Roll \"Spicy Albacore and Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura\" (HH $5.95 / reg $7.95) - Another tasty roll with a bit less heat and a nice subtle crunch from the masago.  * Rose Roll (HH $5.95 / reg $8.95) \"Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura, A-Grade Avocado and Spicy Tuna\" - We're all liking the spicy tuna, so how could this go wrong?  Overall, we were all pleasantly surprised with the drinks and food offered, even at the happy hour.  Service was good, our waitress Briana, was always checking up on us and making sure we had enough food and drink.  We'd definitely go back for more happy hour action now!  They also have a Red Mask Club so you can earn points when you dine."}
{"text":"Being at kabuki was interesting. I really loved the environment compare to the other kabuki at west gate. Definitely more open space and love how the patio was more open and not crowed. Our sever wasn't the best or most attentive. It was at the end of happy hour when we arrived so he could of been more attentive. The only time he was attentive was when he brought the bill."}
{"text":"This afternoon myself along with 14 family and friends went here to celebrate my niece's high school graduation and I order a corona margarita and while I was drinking the drink the waitress ask me to give her the Corona holder back because a lot of people steal them.  Was offended by her statement - spoke with one of the manager and she really didn't seem to concerned about her waitress actions! This will probably be my last visit to this restaurant !"}
{"text":"My wife had a Japanese craving. So here we are at one of our normal stomping grounds. We got there early today and didn't have to wait. Yea  Ordered the rainbow roll, shrimp tempura roll, eel roll, and California roll. Boom sushi came out very fast. Very good and fresh. Really enjoyed the sushi.   I had the beef ribs, chicken teriyaki, and tempura. This came with rice and salad. Was not a real fan of the salad but was okay. The beef ribs were really good. Nice, tender, and very tasty. Tempura was nice and crispy with fresh vegetables and shrimp. Only downfall was the chicken teriyaki. Some pieces were tender and juicy and others were very dry and hard.   My wife had the eel bowl. The eel was cooked perfectly with a huge bowl of rice and vegetables.  It was pretty good.   The serve was very good. Greeted, seated, and welcomed by the server pretty quickly. Filled up the water cups regularly and got our food out pretty fast.   Enjoyed our meal here tonight but ordered too much sushi (but so good). Like I said only downfall was some of the dry chicken teriyaki. First time this has ever happened to us but this won't stop us from coming to this place."}
{"text":"Wow I'm just confused after eating at the Kabuki in Vegas at Town Square... I assumed this one was just as mind blowing, amazing and delicious as Vegas! Please don't be fooled by the name this Kabuki was not good, first our table was so sticky my phone kept getting stuck to the table, the menu was also sticky and  the food was so not good or fresh I do not recommend this place at all, do your self a favor and when in Vegas go to that one the food is amazing, fresh, delicious and that Kabuki is very clean, not to mention  amazing chefs. Okay in all fairness the only good thing about this Kabuki was our server she was the  reason this place even got one star because she was very nice and a great server."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome. The sushi is really good. The service has always been great. The specialty rolls are worth the price. Celebrating my babe's bday today and we picked the right place. The ambiance is lively  lots of fun."}
{"text":"You definitely get a lot of food if you know what to order here. You get free edamame with your rolls and some meals come with miso soup, so that's already a pretty full meal right there! Overall it's pretty good sushi for what you're paying for. I've also tried some of the hot plates and they are good as well. The teas and other drinks are just meh, I don't think they are really worth the money.    I've never really gotten anything \"bad\" here, but one time they took FOREVER to bring my boyfriend's food out to him. I had already finished eating. It was really weird. I've also had to wait almost an hour for a table. You can just go next door to Barnes and Noble and hang while you wait, but it is annoying if you're super hungry."}
{"text":"Just loved this place. Awesome date environment, even though I was with the family on this occasion. They really make the experience memorable for sure.  The hostess was ok - not overly friendly but helpful.  Our server did a good job checking on us from time to time - it didn't seem too frequent.  The food? Amazing! We had the HH California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll. VERY delish, exactly what sushi should taste like.  I even started getting the hang of chopsticks - think of that."}
{"text":"Supa was our server and she is so amazing!  She was very attentive and informative about my dietary needs! (Vegan)  Offered plenty of suggestions!  The Inari sushi and kale salad were delicious! Also the vegan friendly dessert was amazing!"}
{"text":"The Japanese version of PF Changs (Just like Shogun in SoCal)  Stick with the rolls here instead of the pricey and not that good sashimi/fusion dishes. Tuna Tartare in particular was a $10 salt bomb that didn't taste of much except tomatoes and salt. You could puree this into a brandade.  They did have have hirame albeit at 5 slices for around 15 bucks. Cucumber roll was forgettable at $5 for 6 small pieces . (Then again it's cucumber ahahah, don't know why I ordered it)  I'm a big fan of the interior though~"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before but never for lunch. Went with the ramen and it was a good decision. Huge portion for the relatively low price. Would definitely go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and great sushi. We come here often and are never disappointed. Happy hour prices are great, and the atmosphere is always fun."}
{"text":"Tivoli Village is growing. This is a great addition. The sushi selection is awesome. One of my favorite dishes on the menu is the Spicy Seafood Udon! They have a good happy hour. The service is always timely and professional."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a few times and have had Postmates deliver as well. Each time was great! Great selection of sushi! I like the lotus on fire and lobster roll. We love the spicy seafood udon. Decor is nice. Great for groups. Service is always good."}
{"text":"My friend and I always stop here when we meet at Tempe Market Place.. This place is nice, clean, and spacious .. They do have lunch specials which is nice and their staff are friendly .. The food was average.. Nothing stands out to me from the stuff I have tried so far.."}
{"text":"Miso  soup tasted like water, the sushi was subpar at best and the Teriyaki Beef and Chicken tasted sour - the service was great but it can't make up for bad food..."}
{"text":"I will never EVER go back to Kabuki! I was there a few days ago, and quality has definitely deteriorated. I ordered the firecracker as an appetizer, the lotus on fire as an entree, and a mushroom miso as a side. Everything containing \"spicy tuna\" (yes, quoted, I have no idea if it was tuna at all, though I have a sneaking suspicion that it wasn't) was watered down with diced tomatoes! Awful! Less \"tuna\" and more tomatoes? Yuck! My roll was poorly executed and quickly fell apart when dipped into the soy boat. Even my iced green tea seamed too diluted to be called tea. The mushroom miso was okay, so I gave it 1 star. DO NOT visit this place. If you're stuck at Town Square, you're better off saving your money and having a sandwich at Capriatti's!"}
{"text":"I ordered Sun kissed sushi roll and Baja roll, very delicious. Sun kissed sushi roll gives a variety of different rolls, which I like, and Baja roll is perfect for Mexican food lover. This roll is topped with fresh salsa (a bit spicy), yum!"}
{"text":"We come to this place a little bit too often, lol. It is just perfect for lunch and dinner - also kid friendly! We know every waiter by name and they're all good, - even if our first love is Supa!  She remembers our order every time, and is so nice."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping at Townsquare, a friend and I wanted to stop for a bite to eat. It was right around 4pm so we thought it would be a perfect opportunity for a \"Linner\" or \"Dunch.\" The obvious meanings of those words, for those not in the know, is the hybrid of lunch and dinner. I tell you, any excuse to eat! LOL whatever the case, we were hungry so it was time to eat. Sushi is my all time favorite meal so Kabuki was the best option for us!  Kabuki has to be one of the first restaurants when Townsquare first opened. That alone, tells me they are doing just fine. This joint is located across the street from HM and right next to Yogurtland. When you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the hostess stand. You'll then notice a very hip and modern sushi restaurant. Glass walls are painted with Kanji letters and other Japanese artwork. Lots of random posts and walls to create mini intimate dining areas. Just like any reputable sushi restaurant, there's a sushi bar for your convenience as well.  We were sat right behind the hostess station, flushed up against a shelving unit filled with various types of Sake. Our server, Angie, was super sweet. She left us alone for most of the time, but still checked up on us when we needed it. The hostess, however, was a little bit disengaged. She wasn't as personable as I hoped it to be. I know at the end there was a taller hostess that was super sweet. The one I'm talking about was a little shorter, I'd say about 5'5\". Still, that didn't ruin my time. For my meal, I decided to get the following:  -Hamachi/Yellowtail Nigiri for $4.75: the hamachi was super creamy and fresh. I loved that they gave a larger fish portion for a nigiri.   -Salmon Roll for $4.50: Salmon and cucumber rolled in rice and nori seaweed. I normally get the nigiri, but this was a great value for the price. For the roll, you get 6 cut pieces instead of 2 with the nigiri. The salmon was creamier than the hamachi and super flavorful.   -Salmon Kama(Collar) for $7.95: Whenever I visit sushi restaurants, I ALWAYS get a kama. This cut of fish is super flaky, super marbleized, grilled and flavorful and the salmon was no different. The ponzu dipping sauce brought a salty and tangy element, elevating it to new heights. Highly recommend this if you've never tried it.   The waiting time for our meals was super quick and the food was delicious. Those are reasons alone to come back time and time again. Townsquare is a place I frequent a lot, so Kabuki, watch out! I'll be back again soon. For now, thanks for the great time :)"}
{"text":"Kabuki was good based on the few things me and boyfriend ordered! It is VERY expensive for what it is though. We had great service and I had a great experience overall. We ordered about 4 rolls and it came out to a whopping 50$ + alcohol on top of that. It was for lunch too which is really expensive, you might as well check out a all you can eat place."}
{"text":"When you sit down, it's clean and organized. The staff greets new customers in Japanese once you enter; a lot of them talk to each other in Japanese, which I thought was really cool just because you're transported into this foreign world in the middle of the Town Square Mall!   Aside from having a pretty nice happy hour, every time I've been to Kabuki and ordered something I don't usually get, it has been a letdown. I ordered from the Vegetarian Menu, Spicy Tofu on Crispy Rice & Vegetable Ramen. It was just okay, the taste of everything was pretty bland. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the food is pretty good, but the flavors are nonexistent.   If you plan on eating here, just eat at happy hour!   PS. you can get a discount for being an LVAC member. Slide your membership card in when you pay the bill!   Also, don't worry if you don't finish your soup, they have a To-Go soup container!"}
{"text":"Very average sushi chain. The food came out a little too fast, and the rolls looked hastily made. Taste was average. They do have good happy hour deals though!"}
{"text":"The food was great along with our server Jenny but before we got seated, I was one of the first ones to ask for a table and one of the receptionist sat all other parties that came after my husband and I because she forgot. I stood up and asked why we were being seated after everyone else that came after us and she said she forgot. I was right in front of her on the first bench so I don't know how she could forget. Wasn't a good start but the food was good."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's been a year since I've been here. I celebrate mothers day dinner here then catch a movie afterwards..  Great location and atmosphere with best sushi!!  Maybe next time it won't be just for mothers day that i come Back :)"}
{"text":"Went to this place while running errands. It had been recommended by a friend. After seeing a number of other subpar reviews we were a bit hesitant but followed our stomachs over our brains. Shared tuna poke, tuna tartare, gyoza, and 1 sushi roll. Nothing was \"good.\" All of our food was below average. On the upside, service was fine and the atmosphere was pleasant."}
{"text":"Service sucks during the day, but the food so far has been delish, that's the only reason why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"In reality, this review should either be FOUR STARS or ONE.  Let me explain....  Over the last decade, restaurants have developed a new method of food delivery to the table.  I call this person the \"Food Bringer\".  This is the person you've never seen before who shows up 15 minutes after you've ordered from your waiter/waitress and puts your food in front of you.  Good restaurants pull this stunt off seamlessly.  They have to!  When you send a complete stranger to a guests table with their food you had better have a system in place to ensure food arrives at the correct table and is placed in front of the correct person.  Bad restaurants don't properly train the \"Food Bringer\".   The \"Food Bringer\" wanders out with trays of expensive Oriental food and just tosses it on the first table that looks hungry.  This is what happened to us tonight... at this location.  Side Note:  Our waitress, JULIE, was phenomenal.  Management: give her a raise as she's one of the reasons you didn't get a ONE star rating.  The \"Food Bringer\" came out bearing heaping amounts of delicious entrees and placed them haphazardly in front of my family.  Being the hill folk we are, my clan was all over this bounty like a pack of wolves on a three-legged cat.  Julie came rushing over and informed the \"Food Bringer\" of his mistake and he proceeded to load the food back onto the trays, turn 180 degrees to his right, and deliver the food to it's rightful owner.... the people sitting RIGHT next to us.  I'm a little confused at this point.  What's going on?  We arrived first and this \"looked\" like our meal.  It wasn't.  A different \"Food Bringer\" showed up with our correct meal and we managed to help him locate each meal's rightful owner.  One plate in the middle of the table stood out... It was a Tempura Shrimp and Veggie plate that should have gone next door but remained on our table and was being devoured by hungry children.  One more note... my Autistic son managed to grab the croutons from the salad put briefly on our table just prior to it being moved next door.  So, the couple next to us received a meal that was not only missing their Tempura order, but was sans two croutons from a now compromised salad.  Let's move on.  The tables are too small.  Period.  We ordered three entrees to share between four people.  There was NOT enough room for our food.  Plates were hanging precariously over the sides.  Also, in a nice restaurant, the tables should be adjusted daily to make sure they don't \"wobble\" back and forth.  Maybe that's what the chop-sticks are for?  The food?  Pure Heaven!  That's why this SHOULD be a four star review.  Had it not been for small, wobbly tables and untrained \"Food Bringers\", that's exactly what this restaurant would have received.  If I went back, I would not take my children (even though they liked the food) and stick to a twosome.  That would leave ample room on the table for the... FOOD!  Second, I would CHECK the table to make sure it's square with the floor.   Tighten the screws Kabuki.  Your restaurant is beautiful and the food is fantastic.  Fix these issues and I'll amend this review."}
{"text":"It's a good thing that Kabuki has a fun, relaxed atmosphere, because the food is nothing to shout about and the service is a weird combination of hectic yet slow.  To be fair, Japanese food in Arizona is a dicey proposition at best, especially after years in Seattle have spoiled me forever for good Asian food. And at least the layout and feel of Kabuki is open and welcoming, allowing for both big groups and a small, more intimate setting. The free edamame before the meal is a nice touch (I enjoyed it) but not for everyone.  Some would say that a good Japanese restaurant is made or broken on its sushi, and if that were true then Kabuki comes in with a resounding \"meh.\" The portions are nice and big but the sushi itself fails to thrill. For my money, though, it's the Katsu that's the mark of a great Japanese place, and once again Kabuki just doesn't impress. Their Tonkatsu (breaded and fried pork) is bland and unremarkable, with a katsu sauce that tastes a little too much like fancy ketchup.  We had a big group, but the service was much slower than it needed to be, yet the servers seemed to be running around pretty frantically the whole time, often forgetting which dish went with which person, and even better, occasionally forgot what they were carrying.  Kabuki has the feel of a new restaurant still trying to figure out what it's doing. Given some time and refinement of their menu, it has the potential to be that rare thing - a good Japanese restaurant in the desert. Until then, it's only average."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and good service. I always bring my friends here visiting from out of town and they love it just as much as I do!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was absolutely horrible!!! It took 20 mins just to get a drink refill and we only saw our waiter twice."}
{"text":"Let's start off w/ $2 sapporo - can't be beat.  Decor - nice modern simple  Such a great all around surprise.  After the many FAILURES of Tivoli Village, I was surprised and relieved as to how much I enjoyed Kabuki.  The only thing was that it was very slow service.  Our food and drinks took forever.  But great service nonetheless.    ATTENTION All Restaurant Managers take note: Sung (whom I presumed to be the manager as he was the only one in a tie and dress shirt) is the best manager I have seen in the city.  He supports his staff.  He was on the floor the entire night bussing tables, taking drink orders, running food, running checks.  He, unlike most of the awful management here in Las Vegas was not above doing those things.  He looked like he had control of the restaurant, for he was not frantic, but very present.  Nahee, our server was very good.  She had a huge section, yet she kept her cool, spoke intelligently about the menu items.  Food was phenomenal.  Lovvvved the super rich, calorie ridden Alaskan roll.  Great fish - very fresh, with so much flavor.  Salmon skin, was a much simpler alternative which I enjoyed just as much.  Tempura was great.  Not as battered and heavy as I've had in other Japanese restaurants.  Just wish there was sweet potato in our mixed tempura.  Peach sakitini was pretty good, however I normally like stronger drinks.  Still, it was worth my curiosity.    Dessert - Opera Cake.  Very different the typical mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream every other Japanese restaurant has.  Such a delicate taste.  Great ending to an absolutely wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"We were sat with no service for 10 minutes. Than they sat a table behind and in front. 5 minutes After they started taking they're order i got upset and left tables around us were empty at 1st"}
{"text":"I am writing this review solely based on the real sushi. I don't know about the stuff that gets filled with cream cheese and deep fried or other cooked stuff, all I care about when I go to a sushi place is the quality and freshness of the fish, and this place was great.  I ordered: Salmon sashimi (the portion size was larger than expected) Masago Tobiko (they only have wasabi tobiko) Salmon nigiri Hamachi Toro  Uni Spider Roll Spicy Tuna (it was happy hour and ended up taking it back to the hotel for breakfast the next day - yum!)  Everything came out larger than I expected and super-fresh. With uni, the freshness is important, and it was great).  Places like these make me lament living on the east coast since we don't have as much access to the same freshness and qualify of the pacific species of fish.   The prices were reasonable and with happy hour got a 16 oz Sapporo for $5 and free edamame, 1/2 price salmon nigiri and the spicy tuna roll for less than $3.   This place not only  satisfied the sushi monster, I couldn't stop craving sushi for the rest of the trip. That is how tasty and fresh the sushi was.  I will be back. :-)"}
{"text":"Nice location if you're ever craving sushi in the middle of shopping in Town Square.  Happy hours are from 4-6pm and on weekdays.  Great selection of sushi and of course, that its a must everytime I go to a japanese restaurant that I order a screaming orgasm.    Its a place where you can bring a date, family or just chill at the bar.  The interior design kinda suits all that.  The bartenders are very friendly and you can tell there are a lot of the same people that come to the bar because they all seem to know each other.  Fire lotus is my favorite sushi on the menu but everything things else is just ok.  4 stars for the ambience, and friendly service.  Save money by just going during happy hours to see if you like their sushi, because its a hit or miss with some of my friends."}
{"text":"The service is great. They have a great happy hour . Recently addec some new items to the menu. They are very accommodating with parties.  The Dragon roll is awesome and the grilled calamari us fantastic"}
{"text":"Went to happy hour and the food and drinks were great and Brandon our server was on point. The only downfall of our experience was the manager. We were by a service well, which didn't bother me too much, but the manager kept micromanaging and riding their servers, especially ours. It was totally unprofessional and annoying. I almost said something but didn't want it to come down negatively on our server."}
{"text":"We always order takeout from here and love it. The food is great and always hot. The prices are reasonable for the quality and amount of food. I always know that I'm going to love what I get when we order from here :)"}
{"text":"This is a happy hour review.  Our usual all you can eat sushi spot had kitchen issues so we stumbled here. Right when happy hour before closing occurs. This location is quiet, not like town square. The hostess and waitress were friendly and nice. The sushi rolls on the happy hour menu were decent.   Wasn't a fan of their chicken bun, but you have a choice between pork. I wish their poke bowl was some how in their happy hour menu they're very good.   Place was clean, and service was good. Just didn't hit the park for me on what I ordered."}
{"text":"Damn this 5 point system! I don't want to give this place 4 stars, but yet it's not 3, what a dilemma. I will go with the sushi bell curve on this, and reluctantly provide a 4 click with my mouse.  Overall, I had a great experience at Kabuki. It was pleasant decor, good service, and the restaurant was quiet enough to talk, but no too quiet, where if you tell a story you feel like your giving a speech in an auditorium.  They have a great variety of menu items, and the prices are reasonable. Since it was the birthday dinner of my date, and sort of an impromptu meeting of people that didn't really know each other, this place turned out be pretty cool for a new group to get to know each other. We had a group of 7 people, and the service was pretty good I must say. The only mishap was the accidental dropping of a \"spider roll\" I proceeded to wonder, \"who's spider roll is this?\" Which got the table all singing \"spider roll, spider roll does whatever a spider roll can\" from which I quipped, \"oh this is just your friendly neighborhood spider roll.\" I can't help myself, when I can insert a Spiderman joke into  a situation, I just go for it.  From quotes like \"What the hell, where is the fresh Wasabi?\" To trying to determine what the mystery city in Japan was that one dinner guest wanted to travel to, we had fun. I've never wanted an iPhone more than this night, as topics ranged from music, to travel, to types of sushi.  I suggest Kabuki, for fun and games, tom foolery and shenanigans,  and  for sushi goers that don't take themselves too seriously."}
{"text":"Came here a few times. Every visit was wonderful. You have to try their premium saki, so good. The sushi is good not the best but the customer service is excellent! For me service is the key to a great meal. So stop by today and get real service like no other. Great!!!"}
{"text":"Kabuki, I was pleasantly surprised!    We ordered quite a bit on the menu, and I can't say I was disappointed with anything!  Garlic Edamame ($4.95): Sauteed with Sea Salt and Garlic. This was very garlicky and delicious! Loved the bits of crunchy garlic...one of the better versions I've had actually :P  Yakibuta ($6.95): Pork, Jalapeno, and Green Onions. Wish it was a little more tender, but the flavor was good.  Looks like pork belly, but it isn't as fatty or tender as belly.  Omakase Deluxe ($13.95): Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Shrimp, Albacore & Spicy Tuna Roll. SURPRISINGLY GOOD quality nigiri here! I didn't think this would fill me up, but with the appetizers and sides, I left stuffed.    I would come here again if I am hungry in Town Square :)"}
{"text":"Went to Kabuki on Sunday afternoon for a lil bit of sushi with my girlfriends. The place was absolutely empty, and we really wanted to sit out on the patio. The hostess told us to sit wherever we wanted, and then mentioned to us that we probably shouldn't sit all the way on the end because it's too far for the waitress to walk. Not very professional in my opinion. Other than that, great experience. Yummy sushi, good prices, just not the best service."}
{"text":"Felt like being a purist and went with the chirashi bowl !  Lovely presentation - the fish quality was good , but nothing to cry joy about.  Calamari appetizer was fantastic.   Service was on par. I dig the trendy decor and ambiance. It's lovely place for dinner with loved ones."}
{"text":"The food is good and consistent, but we like to sit at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs don't seem to enjoy their jobs as much as other sushi places we go to.  Personality is a big part of sitting at the sushi bar and its disappointing when they don't have that.   We'd order a lot more interesting stuff if we trusted the person making it more."}
{"text":"Enjoyable food and experience  Might have skipped this restaurant had a friend not really wanted to try it.  Glad he did.  Probably the freshest sushi I've had in Phoenix so far.  I'm a sushi snob and loathe anything even remotely stale.  This place had its game going with good ingredients, tight sushi rolling skills, and even some subtle flavors.  Not in the same league as Japan, Taiwan, Hawai'i, or Portland, but superior for the desert.  Service was good.  Somewhat long waits and drinks go empty for a tad, but not egregious.  Plates came out with good timing and together. Check also came quickly.  Gal who served us was nice and got the order right.  Am a fan of the Westgate are and this spot has a good thing going.  Average value.    Hope they can tighten their ship and earn good Yelp reviews on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"WOW. What can I say. Best sushi place ever. I have tried several places and nothing compares to this one. The soy ramen soup is out of this world. OH, don't get me started on the Alaskan roll. Salivating as I type. I haven't tried everything but I am hoping I will with time. I hope when you go, it's as good for you as it was for me."}
{"text":"A big Kabuki fan is in the house. Well if we're discussing other locations to be honest. One of my family favorites is/was the Love Boat! I need my photo from another location that granted our request. I'm guessing they discontinued it due to cost. It was so delicious! Anyways on to tonight's experience.   Came in on a Sunday night with the fam and was a bit disappointed. Maybe the Southern California locations have spoiled me. We ordered a little bit of everything. My favorite and it's safe to say the tables favorite was the appetizer small plate of the short ribs with the grilled onions. The tuna tartare was a waste of calories and money. I don't like have the mix my own tuna tartare and honestly speaking my chop sticks skills didn't help either. The assorted sashimi was so fresh and delicious but I know sashimi isn't for everyone. The rolls were mediocre but by far they very the best dragon rolls I've had. Some people at the table aren't big on sushi so it was a hit for them. Also, we ordered two other rolls I can't recall. They were ahhh alright. Average flavor.... it's hard to impress a sushi lover like me. Now for the second part of the experience as I like to refer to the service.... Man that was average too! Why it was average is beyond me. There is the same about of workers as customers for crying out loud. I couldn't even request a refill request from our actual server until a sweet lady in a collared shirt stop by to \"check on our table\". Oh and I asked an individual what was served on our assorted sashimi platter and he looked dumb founded. I could've probably had a better guess than him. Overall you yelpers have given the right amount of stars to these folks."}
{"text":"If you have never tried this location or menu I highly recommend asking for Lisa She is an AMAZING person who brings fun to dining out."}
{"text":"I'll try just about any sushi place once. Kabuki lived up to the standards I brought with me from the Oregon coast. PLUS our server (Linh) was AWESOME!!!!! Good food, great service, I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"food was good but when I got my charge card bill they charged me more than my receipt. I left a 20% tip and they still charged more.  It appears to be a scam of \"I will just add enough onto the charge that they either won't notice, or it isn't enough to fight over\".  And no, it isn't a case that the numbers got transposed or misread not with the numbers involved.  I have no respect for this restaurant now."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We came here for happy hour today.  Got a lot of food for a good price.  The service is great too.  If you like sushi, this is one of our fav's in Las Vegas.    We had a few different spicy rolls, brussell sprouts and spicy ramen soup.  We will def be back soon."}
{"text":"Don't go if you are looking for super-fresh and well-prepared sushi. If, however, you are looking for a happy hour spot with cheap, good drinks in a chic environment where you can also get some discounted sushi, Kabuki is the spot for you.   My husband and I were going to see the premiere of the Mamma Mia sing-along version at Harkins Tempe Marketplace and wanted to stop at a happy hour or two first. Thanks to previous Yelp reviews, we found out that Kabuki has happy hour featuring drink and food specials, so we decided to check it out. I loved the decor in the bar area - very sleek and modern with lots of cool, vertical Sake bottle displays. Our drinks (on special for $4.95) were quite good - I had the Mint Drop, which was refreshing but not too sweet and he had the Long Island, which was nice and strong without being disgusting. For snacks, we had the Spicy Tuna and Salmon Skin rolls (each $2.95) - both were fine but not much better than the stuff you can buy at grocery stores. Our server was friendly and efficient.   All in all, we got two good drinks and some standard sushi for under $20, including tip. Not bad. Kabuki is definitely a cool spot for meeting some friends for happy hour, but don't count on the sushi being anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Delicious food I love it the  Mediterranean sea bass! Best service ! good price!"}
{"text":"The service is fine, better to go in during happy hour.... N don't miss their seafood undo pasta, yum"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good happy hour menu. I really enjoyed the Alaskan roll and spicy tuna roll. Waitress was very attentive and made the experience enjoyable. Lounge was quiet and cozy great for a night out."}
{"text":"Walking through the mall BAM! Kabuki's exterior Japanese decor hit my eyes! Ouch guys! The appearance is very pleasant. Outside it looks like the usual mom and pop shop in Japan. Within is where all it's jewels are hidden!  Interior decor is calming to the eye. A quiet ambience fills the room, and tables are very spacious. Lots of utensils to use as well!  Food is tasty and fresh! Ingredient quality is high, and the portions are plentiful. I ordered a lunch special which included Miso Soup, Salad, and my entree. My server was nice as well. Good customer service goes a long way.  I didn't use the restroom therefore I can't comment on it. Although the rest of the restaurant was clean! My table wasn't sticky, A+++.  I noticed an outdoor area, although I didn't notice if there were bike racks nearby. No WiFi that my phone could pick up.  Overall, fun and pleasant place to grab a bite on a special or casual eating opportunity. Good jobs guys!"}
{"text":"This place is ANTI 2ND AMENDMENT, ANTI PERSONAL RIGHTS, AND in my opinion Anti American. With that said I got to walk over a half mile to secure My choice of protection and then back. Based on the Anti Gun policy of this place I will never return no matter how good the food. I am only eating here for my wife because she has never had Japanese food. Normally we will never enter a place that stomps on our rights.  First off it took forever to get silverware.   Second I did just see the worst sushi roll eater ever. She pulled the middle out and left the rice and wrappings for the trash.  We ordered two appetizers, two entrées,  and my wife tried the Coco Ginger beer. Normally I would go into great detail on how it all turned out but since it makes no difference since we shall Never return anyway I will not do so. Good Luck"}
{"text":"In and out for lunch break! Great food and amazing service from ASHLEY! I will definitely be back again in the future."}
{"text":"I am no sushi snob, so keep that in mind! I unabashedly admit that I enjoy spicy tuna. With that in mind, here we go.  The new Kabuki is a beautiful, modern spot featuring high ceilings and a pleasant patio. It is definitely a safe spot to bring a variety of people from a first date to your slightly adventurous grandparents. It is a nice environment, and they can accomodate larger groups.  Service is attentive, and they work to make everything right. We experienced a kitchen delay on our visit. We weren't event bothered really, but even without a complaint from us, they took $10 off our bill.  The menu is huge, so you are sure to find something for everyone, including kids! They boast an award-winning kid menu. One of my favorite things about Kabuki is that they will make any roll with brown rice! I ordered the Lotus On Fire with brown rice, and it is pretty much my sushi amateur ideal - a California roll with spicy tuna, lotus chip and thinly sliced jalapeno on top served with a side of crunch. That along with the sautéed asparagus appetizer are a perfect light dinner for me.   The husband also tried their spicy ramen, and he was a happy diner.   The beverage menu is extensive as well. It was late, so I didn't want to load up on iced tea. However, I noticed they had approximately five varieties of iced tea.  Overall, it may not be the trendiest sushi spot, but it is definitely a pleasant dinner with quality service in a comfortable environment and a bonus brown rice bump!"}
{"text":"Really bad service.  Took forever to bring out our food.  The chicken was completely burnt."}
{"text":"The pork buns were amazing. Great service, we asked them to split it up in 3 and they were quick to cut it nicely in 3 pieces for us to share a variety of appetizers.   Edamame was  well season and cooked.   The chilean seabass, perfection, great flavors, great texture.    Lobster roll, yes, get that! delicious, flavorful top, flavorful roll, all around great restaurant."}
{"text":"Handsdown on FRESHNESS and yummines of their fishes =p...I come here just for their Hamchi Kama...but they only have one or two so I come here right after my David Barton Gym session...so convenient and delish...GREAT service, good food and the prices are just right.  You get what you pay for.  Definitely way better than AYCE places in town...they just know how to create REAL sushi."}
{"text":"The ONLY Japanese restaurant that u should go to.  Freshest fish. Presentation. Quality good food.  Good service."}
{"text":"Nestled within the confines of Tempe Marketplace lies Kabuki - a great Japanese restaurant with great food, service, and style.  Four of us walke in on a Sunday evening and were quickly seated - my eyes going right for the Chicken Teriyaki on the menu.  I don't go in much for Asian cuisine, but this exceeded my expectations.  The sheer amount of juicy chicken I received was glorious, and it came with soup AND salad.  Everything was tasty, the chicken wasn't completely drenched in sauce (which is what I usually expect to happen) and the miso soup and salad nicely complemented the main course.  I also feel like you often get skimped on rice at places like this but that was a non issue here!  Our server was great for the most part.  My only nitpick is that I was served my salad, soup, and chicken all at once within minutes, but the three others I was with didn't receive their food for another ten minutes.  I tend to expect better coordination than that from the kitchen.  Overall a great evening, I would go back if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"My family had a great server, Huy. Very quick, very knowledgeable and gave us everything we needed in a timely manner. The restaurant has mazing food and drinks, I always come back."}
{"text":"I personally didn't get sick, but I thought the food sucked. The watiress was relatively friendly, the atmosphere was decent, but I go to a restaurant for the food!  Drinks were tasty, but very watered down/full of juice tasting.. for ~10 I want at least a shot of booze in my drink! Edamame was cold.. not a fan. Tempura was just ok, instead of sweet potatoes they had normal potatoes.. this is a sin in my book. We had the griled yellowtail collar.. I expected more of a seared thing, but this was fully cooked not yummy fish.. Other appetizer was the gyoza and they even managed to screw up frozen fried food. The dumpling was crispy on top and super soggy on the bottom.  The sushi was just EH... not fishy or anything, just not particularly good. The pacific roll was the best roll we tried by far... if you get dragged to this place like I did, play it safe and try that one !"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi snob......and I enjoyed this place.  Service was EXCELLENT!  Our server, Ryan, was knowledgable with a great sense of humor. Food was fresh and big portions. They didn't skimp on the fish in our rolls. Garlic edamame was very strong so make sure your date eats it too. We ordered the albacore crunch roll, poke tuna, crispy spicy tuna appetizer, lotus roll, and shrimp tempura roll. Love the fresh jalapeño to top!  Everything was eaten with no complaints at all!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while.  The menu was smaller but the prices were increased to make up for it.  The food was average.  Nothing better.  It will be a long time before I go back to Kabuki again, if ever.  In Las Vegas, there are lots of good alternatives."}
{"text":"I really like Kabuki because they give you the option of getting brown rice sushi! We have eaten in and gotten take out quite a few times and the service has always been great. It can get a little busy on the weekends but it's a nice date night atmosphere."}
{"text":"There was five of us four Chinese and one American   We order family style for the table. It was amazing two hour experience. Highly recommend the delightful food atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, I didn't expect much for a sushi place at Tempe Marketplace (a huge outdoor shopping mall). Well, I was wrong - the food and service here are astounding. The atmosphere is stylish and open and the price was fair. Try the crab legs and the spicy tuna roll. Great place to eat before watching a flick."}
{"text":"I've been to other Kabukis in town. The locations in Glendale and Peoria are all pretty much the same. They're nice inside but there's nothing special the chain. The presentation is always nice, the food is always decent and the service is always just so-so. Kabuki isn't a place I go to regularly, its a place I go to if it's convenient. I have only been to the Tempe location this one time, and while I normally would not review a place where I only ordered a drink, I feel compelled to review my experience here. I met up with some friends here the other night to get a drink before going to see Eat, Pray, Love. I walked in the door and was completely ignored by the host. I walked into the bar where my friends were and ordered a drink. The bartender was completely unfriendly. The only words he said to me was \"Here you go\" when he handed me my drink. That's it. He didn't even ask to take my order, he just walked up to us and stood there until I placed my drink order. A few minutes after he brought me my drink he brought out my friend's sushi roll and walked away. Just the roll. No soy sauce dish,  no wasabi, no ginger. He never came back except to drop off the bill. We paid and left."}
{"text":"This place is really great, it's got the look, it's got the taste, and it just has that overall feel that a Japanese restaurant should have. I've only been here 3 times and I'm just in love with the food. The tonkatsu entree is my personal favorite and it comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura which is the perfect combo. I really recommend this place for people looking for a good Japanese restaurant no matter if you're looking for sushi, tempura, or any other entree."}
{"text":"Ordered lobster dynamite, it was just gross :/. Also ordered the crab and California roll, the rice on both were very dry and sticky, overall lacking flavor. First time ordering here and never again!!!!!!!!! It was not worth $45 :/"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now before movies at the harkins theatre and I would go back again. While this is not the trendiest sushi place, nor the cheapest, but it delivers decent quality seafood and better than average service. If your at tempe marketplace for whatever reason and want to grab a quick healthy bite to eat give this place a shot. Next time im going to try to make it for happy hour as they have good deals then."}
{"text":"Poor poor service!!! I came in early lunch and there were 2 customers and 2 waiters. Although the sushi chefs greet you, no one came to my table to offer me a drink. I was sitting there for almost 10 minutes and the waiters each passed me by 3 times like I was invisible. It wasn't even busy. I went over to Tommy Bahamas around the corner and they were more attentive and welcoming. Gosh customer service makes such a huge difference. The workers at kabuki looked miserable to be there and the energy was wack! I used to go here for happy hour but I guess they're only happy during happy hours."}
{"text":"Reserved a table for a party of 15 and my table was ready on time on a busy Saturday night. The food came out in a timely manner for everyone and it was fresh and delicious! The green tea ice cream is a great dessert to end dinner with."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner. The sushi was delicious as always and the staff was friendly. The location is prime, too."}
{"text":"Nice decor, and atmosphere.  The food looked really great, the taste was good.  Its kinda pricey though, but a nice place overall.  Had a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"King Crab sushi was great. No rice wrapped with cucumber with all fresh crab. No imitations. For main entre I had the Mediterranean sea-bass. Prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I co worker wanted to do sushi for his Birthday Lunch . . . and so I recommended this place since I have had great luck here before . . . godd thing he is not a big sushi person since he thought it was great, and I . . . well not so much this time.  We were seated promptly and our waiter came and got our drink order . . . Green Iced tea for me and a soda for the Birthday boy . . . hard to screw up a soda, but the green tea tasted water down and was cloudy . . . obviously not a fresh brew  (minus one star).  We both ordered the seaweed salad . . . and since I had eaten it before, I was really looking forward to it . . . the seaweed was great, but more than half the salad was arugula . . . really arugula . . . are you kidding me, I ordered a seaweed salad  (minus one half star).  Along with the salad we ordered a Lotus Roll . . . rices was not sticky, so the roll fell apart . . . the lobster was luke warm and way to chewy . . . whats going on . . . those appetizers were my go to items  (minus one half star).  Entree my friend had the tempura shimp, and I had the Koshou Beef . . . the beef was tough and chewy, shitaki mushrooms were almost unrecognizable, the asparagas was over cooked and mushy . . . and the sauce . . . well lets just say it had a burnt taste to it . . . overall not a very good entree  (minus one star).  The atmosphere and service were good . . . but again . . . nothing to write home about.  I am hoping this was just an overall bad day for the this place, because it has been great in the past . . . only time will tell."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have the ninja deluxe special that comes with chicken teriyaki, sushi, and the works for a great price during lunch.  The food itself is fresh and tastes great.  Overall, it's one of the tastiest and value priced Japanese place I've tried."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Complimentary edamame. Happy hour was great. Love the dragon roll. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch for the first time.  It's a real nice environment. The black decor was cool.  When you first walk in the \"21 and over only\" section is to your right, where the bar is located. The hostess was very nice. I got the \"Baja Roll\" which is a generous serving.. it's a heaping mound of tomato salsa with shredded crab meat on top of a spicy crab roll ($6.95).  And I had the \"Ninja Deluxe\" which is strips of Teriyaki Chicken on a bed of lettuce, a bowl of white rice, a side of Tempura vegetables, a bowl of soup that I didnt like..lol, and 3 California roll pieces ($9.95).  I also had a bottle of \"Tea Zazz\" which is cold sparkling wasabi green tea with several different flavors.. I got the ginger mint flavor ($2.95).  The waitress was nice and attentive.. not anything exceptional but she was still very courteous.  I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"There's actually a kabuki down the street from me in LA (home). But during my trip to Vegas I was craving sushi and my handy dandy yelp showed me that there was a kabuki down the street from our hotel! Awesome location, close to shopping and h&m. Plenty of FREE parking behind h&m! Walked in for dinner and there was no wait! Got seated by the hostess and we ordered.  Firecracker was so good! Spicy tuna with wonton chips were so delicious we scarfed it down even before I could take a picture!  Albacore crunch roll was delicious! Wish I could have taken one for the long drive back to LA!   Stop by for the awesome happy hour and great service! I'll definitely be back! Nothing bad to say about this place :)  Oh and I just found out there free edamame is now organic! How great :) trI love free and healthy stuff!"}
{"text":"Went to Kabuki for lunch today in Tivoli village, I was seated immediately ans was waited on very quickly. I ordered the Salmon teriyaki with brown rice and a order of the garlic edamame. The salmon was a little over cooked but still good but the garlic edamame was so good that I would definitely go back just for that. I feel the price is a little high but it is Tivilo village."}
{"text":"After we watched Deadpool, I convinced some of my crew to go to this sushi restaurant. The cool part about Tempe Marketplace is that it conveniently has everything you ever need in a hipster outdoor mall. Even when it's 120 degrees in the summer, Tempe Marketplace mists so much water it feels like it's 80.  Whether you need to go to the movies, enjoy some music, dance some salsa or eat at the handful of chain and authentic restaurants, Tempe Marketplace is a nice little hub for all of that. Of course, from what I gathered, there is only one Asian place that stands out and that is a sushi restaurant.  My friends have told me about Kabuki. I might have even met someone who actually worked there. It's a nice, upscale-feel restaurant without it being too upscale.   Taste My friends decided to just order a bunch of rolls for us to eat. We got the following rolls Firecracker roll (waiter recommended): This beautiful yet simple roll has a california roll stacked with a pink piece of salmon and the most unique part is that it not only has a crisp lotus root piece and japaleno, but on the sides is lined with this crunchy panko crumbs and mayonnaise based hot sauce. To eat this roll, I find it effective to dip the piece in the mayo and then use the mayo as a sticky agent to the crunchy bits. This essentially coats the piece in the crunchy bits. Pop it in your mouth and hopefully you aren't super clumsy and drop the jalapeno or lotus root on your plate.   Overall, a good roll with a refreshing heat thanks to the fresh jalapeno. The crunch provided from the panko crumbs and lotus root makes this piece enjoyable. We even ordered another rone because we liked it so much.  Rainbow Roll: This was a standard roll and I wasn't very impressed with it. The ingredients didn't look very fresh and so I didn't eat much of it. I had one piece and to be honest, I was not impressed at all. It's a standard sushi roll. Nothing special really.   Dragon Roll: Layered with unagi, this roll is supposed to look like a dragon. They kind of nailed it...  The unagi was delicious but I feel like the prize of the dish was the giant piece on the \"face\" of the dragon. The big piece of Unagi was extremely satisfying. The res tof the roll was ok. Kabuki Roll: If I ever had a roll to myself, I would get this one. Each of the 8 rolls has a special design on it that made it seem like an auspicious journey just to eat it. I would say this was my favorite roll because of the simplicity yet creativity of each piece of sushi. I only had the salmon flower and the salmon roe pieces. The salmon flower was alright but that salmon roe was deliciously salty and it reminded me that I should eat salmon roe more often. As you can see from the picture, the plate leads you to all different types of textures and flavors that are ripe for eating.  Ambiance Kabuki has nice architecture and it reminds me of a sushi restaurant and a really tame nightclub. It has a dark, mysterious vibe and the waiters and waitress's all black uniforms give it a sense of professionalis. Overall, this restaurant has perfect ambiance and I loved the shapely decorations of the whole place.   This place is also huge for a sushi restaurant which shows that they have done well for themselves. It has a Japanese theme, but the style is very new-age American.   Service I think our waiter was new but he was alright. I always do a stress test and ask the waiters what their favorite dish is. He said the firecracker roll and I say he has good taste. Nothing much to write home about here. Being in a hot spot for entertainment in Tempe, these guys have to be quick and efficient to get stuff done.  Cost Specialty rolls cost around $12-18 dollars and grilled and hot stone items are generally more expensive.  Selection I would say Kabuki has a very standard sushi menu: there's plain rolls, better rolls, grill items, noodles and all that stuff. Their drink selection is not bad either, with their sake being the showcase of what to order. These bottles range from $20 to $200 so they are really into sake here. The only truly unique roll I saw was the Kabuki roll which is fitting because that's the   Overall Overall, it's honestly just sushi. You can tell this place is really catered for the general population that inhabits Tempe Marketplace. If you want good sushi in Tempe Marketplace this is the best (probably only) sushi place that gives you a diverse menu, nice atmosphere and decent sushi. I recommend all the rolls we had except for the rainbow roll unless you're not adventurous. However, if you aren't adventurous, then you might just want to stick with California rolls."}
{"text":"We came here for the vegan sushi and it was a success!  My sister lives in Vegas and brought my husband and I here for lunch. By far the best sushi we have ever had. I had the veggie sushi wraps which came with three dipping sauces; sesame, kale and soy. I also got the tofu rolls which were amazing!  Great options for vegans, we will come here again!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand how this place would get anything less of 5 stars. After reading some of the reviews on here I am so disappointed at what the main complaints are. I guess some people are used to going to an over the top sushi place in Scottsdale where you get your ass wiped for you. I mean seriously get over yourselves people. Kabuki is THE BEST! I love the veggie roll there, the avocado, and pretty much anything vegetable. I have tried other sushi places (Stingray, Sushi Brokers, etc) and I can honestly say that nothing compares. Friday night and Saturday nights, yes it gets busy, yes, you may have to wait, get over it. If it's busy and it takes a few minutes for your alcoholic drink to arrive, so be it, it's JUST a drink. I love coming to Kabuki, I love that they offer the Red Mask Club so you can get coupons in the mail, and over all I love the Reverse Happy Hour. Buy one get one for a dollar? Yes please :)"}
{"text":"I would give them an easy 5 if their menu wasn't this expensive. But you get what you pay for, and this place exceeds all.  Tip: happy hour 3-6 ;)"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place that isn't located in San Francisco. Maybe it isn't blindingly authentic, but it's ways fresh, fast, and friendly. The people with negative reviews on here don't know the first thing about sushi... They're also recommending RA as one of the best places to get sushi... I rest my case. Kabuki offers tons of really original stuff. The Baja roll is a spicy crab roll with pico de gallo on top--so good and refreshing. The hamachi box sushi is one of my favorites of all time. Sort of wish the edamame was warm rather than cool, but that's a personal thing."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing service from Liam! Some of the best service I've had in a long time. I would have given 5 stars but the patio was very dirty."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I'm in town square, I HAVE to eat at Kabuki. 12/10 would eat at this place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been going to the Kabuki in Glendale for the last 6 months and the service and quality of food had went way down within that time. We decided to try the one in Tempe and boy do we miss the Glendale location after eating here. Our waitress (Aurora) was never any where to be found, we were sat prior to another table of hers and she told us she would be back took the other tables orders left and then came back and took ours, they were served and given their meals prior to us when we were seated before them. It took her over 10 min just to bring us edamame, refills were not given unless we asked (when we actually saw her), a few times we had to ask other waiters for things as well as the hostess. When we finally got our order the rolls were not wrapped tight, the albacore was pieced together on the rolls, the baja rolls had very little baja sauce and we had to ask for more and the California rolls were falling apart just as we grabbed them. When we spoke to the manager (Zhen) he pretty much showed in his expression and his responses that he was not interested in anything we were telling him claimed they were busy and they definitely were not especially when other tables were getting extremely good service. He took the rolls off of our bill however I would never recommend going to the Tempe location again."}
{"text":"Been going to the Glendale location for a a little over 4 months, my husband and I make it a place for our \"date\" nights without our kids. We went as recently as sunday and our service gets worse and worse every time. The food has also been very different as well not like the first time we had went there. We ordered sautéed asparagus and sent it back probably 3 times and finally just told them we didn't want it because it had no flavor, cold, and just wasn't tasty. Last night we had one refill, and waited over 20 min for our server to come back with our card. I can probably say sunday was our last visit to this location."}
{"text":"On a Tuesday afternoon, I went during their happy hour and ordered the calamari, mussels, inari and a tokyo mojito.  - good prices. happy hour is from 3-6pm. I've only been to the one in brea, ca. so very similar.  - service is hasty. got our food in no time. no need to use the pencil. just order and theyll do it for you. - sucks that even though you have a party of 4, you still get the same amount of edamame.  - virgin tokyo mojito???! i swear it tasted like nothing was inside :/  We came back here again on a Monday night, during reverse happy hour and ordered  Sapporo Mug 1.95 Fire Cracker 5.95 Krab Salad 5.95  Alaskan Roll 6.95 BBQ Beef Ribs 14.95 Anniversary Birthday Month deal -15  for $27  - The Anniversary birthday deal paid for the BBQ Beef ribs which was amazing! I highly recommend it.  - Reverse HH deals are not as good as HH, but bc the timing is late, it works out just fine.  - When I am not in the mood for AYCE sushi, Kabuki is our go-to spot."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! I love the ahi tuna salad. Always fresh sushi and fast service. Not bad prices either. Miso soup and ramen soup are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the sushi is delicious. The environment is really relaxed/comfortable & btw Huy is a great waitress!!!! Love it"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this place. I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.  Came here with a larger group of people. Food came relatively quickly and menu seemed extensive enough with some good, unique and tried-and-true Japanese/sushi restaurant options. Sushi was fresh-tasting, but nothing groundbreaking. I must say that I really enjoyed the oyster shooter and am craving it right now--this was the only dish were presentation lacked pretentiousness, yet taste was superb. Rolls and nigiri was also above average in taste and freshness...  So, since I seemed to like the food just fine, why only 2 stars? Well, for atmosphere, service and prices, to say exactly. Prices were over-inflated considering the food is not the best out there. I've had better at hole-in-a-wall sushi places! Service was rude and often made inappropriate comments over certain food orders (like my \"unique\" oyster shooter). Service was also slow and not helpful by any means. At the end of the day I was overcharged on my credit card bill and had to dispute the charges with my credit card, since managers/servers were not helpful.  Atmosphere was too trendy for my liking--I don't like to go to a sushi place and feel like I'm in a club, it is not my thing. I want to enjoy my food and eat in peace with relatively timely service. I didn't get peace here. Oh no. It's hard to get peace and quiet when techno music is booming all around and tables are so close together that you can hear everything that is being said by your neighboring diners despite the annoying and loud techno-trance! Decor is very loud as well, but not in a good sense. It's a hodge-podge of ridiculously looking booths and pictures that go better with a club environment than a sushi place.   This place scored a \"0\" for ethnicity, since there was nothing ethnic, Japanese about it. Even the food, although good, was largely Americanized. There was no Ikura (large caviar) even offered! Seaweed salad was not good and I had to ask waiter twice for a miso soup for him to even know if they served it/what it was.  I would not recommend this place. I do like Town Square experience, but I would go to countless other restaurants there before I went to Kabuki again."}
{"text":"Well, the manager wrote me and had done some investigation into the issue which is impressive. So at least I found out what \"got\" me (regular soy sauce in side salad dressing). I appreciate the information and the gesture."}
{"text":"There's something for everyone at Kabuki. I always like to come here for a nicer setting. The server's are usually pretty attentive and for an asian fusion joint there are some hits here.   Standouts:  Okonomiyaki- Japananese pancake to share that has squid and cabbage and lots of japanese mayo and Okonomiyaki sauce. The pancake came out nice and warm we had to pace ourselves because it's a large appetizer  -Sukiyaki- warming beef noodle broth slightly sweet reminds me of a bulgogi hot pot. It's especially good when it's cold outside   Lunch combos- Ramen and roll combos are such a good deal and you get a lot of food!  Sushi rolls: My favorite roll is the sunkissed roll it has avocado and salmon sashimi and always is pretty.  Sashimi is pretty decent here too.   Stay away from the california rolls and philly rolls for some reason they don't feel that fresh I sampled some during happy hour they were were kind of meh. Maybe the rice needs more sushi vinegar.   Overall a cute date place! We always leave happy and full from here.  One star down because I don't like their new checking system and credit card terminals that servers bring. It puts you on the spot to tip and pay there without printing the receipt for you. There is also no tip line on the printed receipt just the suggested percentages in their terminals. And of course the server is just standing there watching. - This is the kind of sneaky stuff that makes people not want to tip more when you force us just sayin'"}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi! Some of the best in Phoenix, hands down. Try their signature rolls.  We had good service, but it was around 10pm and not a lot of people were there."}
{"text":"Staff was very courteous and on point, however I am on day 2 of GI side effects from the albacore....not happy.   Update- I was contacted by the manager, whom was polite and concerned with my symptoms. He continued to check on me to make sure I was doing OK. My symptoms did resolve and I did get better and he refunded me my bill. Sometimes these things happen and it will not deter me from trying something different on their menu.  Overall excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Happy hour fried calamari , dynamite roll , shrimp tempura Didn't  like the sesame chicken , for a light cool drink ....Ozeki Nigori is a must  !!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot! They've got a great special with nigiri, a spicy tuna roll, salad, and edamame for 13 dollars. This place is packed all the time- but if you seated at the bar it gets a bit better. The menu has a lot of options- maybe too many? But still solid fish that's cut nicely. No AYCE tho."}
{"text":"Went in last night for dinner with my family. There were 5 of us and we ordered a variety of appetizers, sushi, and entrees. Everyone loved the food and even with some picky eaters, we were all happy. I had only been to Kabuki once before, but I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The Kabuki Deluxe lunch platter is an awesome deal from here.  You get a ton of really good Japanese food for a decent price!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst service we've had, well, since Seafood Harbor Palace on Spring Mountain. This service was so horrible, that I have been so inclined to write my review mid-dining! Seriously, it will take me about 5 - 10 minutes to review this place, the same length of time it took for the server to acknowledge us, then handle 3 other tables that were closing checks, then finally arrive back at our table to take our order. No apologies. That's the stickler...service anywhere should come with manners.  And that was what first alerted me to wanting to review this place. The hostess was the first person we encountered with the lack of mannerism that comes with service. I think it pains her to smile. The poor woman could not even muster up a grin, and a courteous welcome, or even an apology for the wait.  The scene went something like this:  We walk in to an abandoned front counter, wait 2 minutes. Grimace, that's what we'll call her, shows herself and acknowledges us with: \"How many?\" (no greeting, no smile). Then she walks away to sit a previous guest. She then returns and asks us again, \"Did you say for 4?\" (no thank you for the wait, and did I mention NO SMILE?) Then finally, Grimace sits us. Oh yeah, and with her less than 10-word vocabulary, she doesn't bother to realize that we required kids' menus. Weird.  In short, poor customer service here. We will not dine here again. The single star is for the food...it was okay, just okay. You will definitely find better Japanese cuisine elsewhere. People who don't belong in customer service should not be working in this kind of establishment. There are far more people on this earth willing to work on a busy, money-making New Year's Eve with a better attitude. If management can't figure that out, then oh well, they are down one paying patron. Sayonara."}
{"text":"An awesome Vegas find off the strip and not expensive like other places are there. I really enjoyed the Tuna Poke and my spice salmon roll. They have an extensive menu with lots of yummy options. If I go back to Vegas I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Happy Hour here is awesome. They have a great menu and the sushi is fresh and delicious. It is a huge restaurant and you can bring your own Sake for a small corking fee. The only downfall is the service, it SUCKS!! Been here many times and the service is always the same."}
{"text":"Average sushi place, nothing wrong with it, but also nothing special. If you are around the area and in the mood from some sushi, it will do the trick."}
{"text":"Kabuki opened up today minutes from my house at Tivoli Village. This is awesome because there's really no other place like this in Summerlin. Kabuki is a somewhat Americanized chain. I have been to the locations in Pasadena, Hollywood and at Town Square in Las Vegas. Kabuki is by no means an upscale restaurant but for whatever reason this one has a nicer, modern feel. I'm not sure if its the decor, neighborhood its in or maybe just cold temperature inside the restaurant. Anyhow, I am a fan of the mushroom miso, shishito peppers and spicy tuna on crispy rice -like all other locations this one did not let me down. The service was a little on the slow side but I can over look this being it was their first day. Anyhow, do not expect to have the authentic Tokyo experience here. This is tasty food at decent prices. I also believe they have a happy hour."}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good! It's to die for!  The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because its super small thus a very loooong wait time and prices are sooooo expensive.  I sat at their Teppan grill with my then fiance and we had a blast!  You gotto try it and call to make a reservation before hand it will help!"}
{"text":"This place does get very busy so you do have to call ahead and make a reservation.  They don't get 5 stars because their terriyaki chicken and steak really isnt that great, plus they dont have fried rice just plain white rice.  They have great service. They serve their edamame cold so just add some salt to make it better. My date had a rainbow roll which he swears was the best he's ever had.  I also ate at their Tempe location last year and their sushi was great!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to sushi place, but it appears that they changed the menu :(. My husband only goes there for the B.S.C.R roll but it was not what he remembered! It is supposed to be served warm but was more on the colder side. The signature creamy sauce did not taste that good.   I ordered the sun devil roll but it was mainly just a bland roll with a ton of pick de gallo all over it. Definitely not worth the price!   The service was great! But unfortunately the food wasn't."}
{"text":"Stop in for happy hour! Monday to Friday 3pm-6pm.  My favorite items on the happy hour are the Alaskan Roll (baked salmon on top of a California roll) it was so good. I love baked sushi rolls. The dynamite roll was also really good. It has baked scallops, crab meat and cheese on the top of a California roll.   They also have really good lunch deals. They have a variety of box lunches teriyaki chicken from chicken katsu.  I recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, services was also excellent. But place is dirty, booths are filthy, seats are all torn. It's run by kids by the way."}
{"text":"i wouldn't say this is the best sushi i've had or anything but i did enjoy my meal and i would go back. our server was very nice but didn't offer us a second beer and forgot one of the apps we ordered. we were about finished eating when we finished our beers though, and i was too full to even eat the other app had it come out, so it turned out all right. upon sitting, we got a small plate of edemame. any place that serves it without me having to ask or pay extra is ok in my book. although it was cold, which i thought was a little unusual. still not bad though. i got 2 of the specialty rolls on happy hour special: vegas and alaska. i liked the crispy one better, although i can't remember which one that was. the other one came with salmon on top which was the best part of that one. although both were good. my friend ordered shrimp tempera roll, also off the happy hour menu, and sesame chicken. we both enjoyed our meals and the price was reasonable, at least with the happy hour discounts. i think next time i'd like to try sitting at the sushi bar for that experience."}
{"text":"Supatra was our server today. Very attentive and thoughtful! Great service and good food for reasonable lunch special price even on Saturday! She brought us separate to-go containers for ramen leftover without us asking. Always nearby for drink re-filled. Thumbs up for our dining experience today!"}
{"text":"Wow! Got free cal roll and edamame!!! Just checked in though yelp. That was great surprise.  Great deal.  Love it!!! :)  Spicy tofu was good presentation, we enjoyed.   Ramen was standard, nothing special."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there Friday, March 25th so we both walk up to the host podium and my wife asks how long the wait is and one of them says 20 minutes. We looked at each other and said OK. They both watched us sit down in the waiting area and I asked where the bathrooms were so I went and came back and sat next to my wife passing both hostesses twice..  About 15 minutes later my wife gets up to just check on the wait time, or remaining time and the dark haired woman tells her we weren't on the list because we didn't give our name. First of all there was no one else waiting and secondly neither one of the two dingbats even asked us.   Both of them could clearly see us sitting on the bench directly to their right side the whole Damn time. That same woman had a Deer in the head light look on her face when confronted about everything so we got up, I said a few choice words and left after almost 20 minutes of waiting.   What pissed us of the most was her callousness and blatant disregard when my wife asked if we'd have to wait all over again and her answer was a matter of fact yes. What a shitty way to treat a first time, never ever again customer!"}
{"text":"Was going to be at Town Square last night to see the new LCD Soundsystem documentary (one word review inside a review:  AMAZING), and I'm not a huge fan of the Town Square dining options.   Kabuki has disappointed me in the past with what seemed to be generic plates of food synonymous with chain restaurants.   This was the perfect time for me to possibly experience a 2 star meal so that I could further expand my rating distributions which lean towards 3-5 star reviews.  PERFECT.  We started by trying the Sake Sangria as we'd been recommended it by a friend who knows how much we like the Bachi Burger Sake Sangria.   It got brought out in a giant carafe with a lot of fruit mixed throughout.  So far so good.   Tastewise?  Not even close, Bachi Burger's version blows it out of the water.   It had a strong flavor within it that didn't sit well with it.  At first I thought it was possibly overpowered with sake but my dining companion suggested that they thought it was the lemon peel.   I'm going to lean towards that being the origin of the flavor because after polishing off this gigantic monstrosity of a carafe, neither of us had a buzz.   What a deal for $24!  Strike one, but on the plus side, the 2 star review was already writing itself!  Things took a turn when the food started arriving, surprisingly enough to me.   First up was the garlic and sea salt edamame.   A bit overpriced at $5 I thought but the amount they provided as well as the deliciousness of it made it worth it.  The edamame was perfectly cooked and the sea salt and garlic mixed throughout was extremely tasty.  They also brought out an extra bowl of regular edamame, which they said was on the house.   Appreciated, but a little weird to me considering we'd ordered this giant plate of the other edamame.   None of the regular ones got eaten unfortunately.    Next up was the Niku Kushiyaki appetizer, a skewer of beef with shishito peppers.  I thought the meat was a tad overcooked but the flavors were nice, particularly when combined with the shishito and whatever sauce was on the plate with them.   A good choice for $6.  Yellowtail Carpaccio is a standard order for me at a sushi restaurant and this one didn't impress, but wasn't necessarily bad either.  My companion ordered the king crab miso soup which I tried a bit of and greatly enjoyed.  The crab was plentiful throughout and I thought it had a nice flavor that melded nicely with the standard miso.  Lastly I had the Sushi Omakase Special which had an assortment of nigiri with a California Roll and a bowl of regular miso soup.   I was quite impressed with the majority of the nigiri.   Most of the fish tasted fresh and were prepared well, and the california roll was... well, a california roll, but a good version nonetheless.  The only two downsides to the plate were the Krab nigiri, which tasted like the cheap imitation it is, and the eel, which is usually my favorite bite on a plate of Omakase, but this one didn't taste as tender as I'm used to, which I think was a sign it might not be as fresh.   All the other bites were great though and I cleaned my plate.  So I'm a little indifferent on how I feel.  On the one hand, now I still only have a handful of 1 and 2 star reviews, but on the other hand, I had a really nice meal!   It'd be a 4 star review if the Sake Sangria wasn't so disappointing and also if I hadnt had the mediocre meals I've had here in the past."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go when we are in Vegas. The salmon teriyaki is delicious and cooked to perfection each time. The sushi is great. If you are in Vegas and want a change from the $35-40 a plate restaurants in the big casinos, head to Town Square and hit up Kabuki."}
{"text":"I've peeked in here many times and said - this place looks cool - I need to check it out soon.  I finally did with a friend who knows her sushi...  she sent back her first order and overall was displeased (and she had been there in the past).  My food and the appetizers we ordered (different rolls) just were not that good - pretty sure I could put something tastier together.  Our waiter was a nice guy - unfortunately he was unavailable whenever we needed him.  Pretty much a bummer experience."}
{"text":"No, no, no.   This is supermarket quality sushi. Most people were eating rolls, perhaps they knew better. The fish was mediocre quality and questionable in its freshness. There is no reason to settle for this when there are so many better sushi restaurants all over town."}
{"text":"While the food is always good, I have become exhausted with the lack of service, and attention I receive there.  My money should be as good as anyone else's.  Their take what we give you, and like it attitude is getting old.  They had plenty of tables, but hinted I should sit in the bar because it was empty.  It's like Bachi Burger, who wouldn't let me sit at that bar unless I ordered alcohol.  While both P!aces have good food, it's NOT that good that I have to wait to be seated for half an hour when there aren't a lot of people there.  I am thankful the lady at the front counter was on her high horse today.  Managements lackluster attitude to customer service sent me to Sawa Sushi on West Blue Diamond Road.  They are a mom, and pop, unlike chains who could cafe less.  Bye Kabuki, forever!  I wouldn't eat there ever again if was free."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch on a Saturday. I had the lunch special, Tonkatsu Ramen ($9.95) had a nice broth. Pork belly was overly fatty and tough, rolled up like a slice of lunch meat. Only vegetable in the soup was bean sprouts. Noodles undercooked.  Spicy tuna roll ($4.95) was good! Nice flavor and great texture but rice is not sticky. Also, it came out warm, like room temperature...  Ordered vegas roll ($11.95), was mostly rice, barely any salmon or avocado.. it was sad. Temperature was off, it was also room temp.  I expressed my disappointment. They took my bill down to $8. I tipped my waiter $10, it wasn't his fault and David was an awesome, attentive server. The service was excellent, including the manager who came over to apologize and ask if they could remake the roll, send another or whatever I wanted.  I will give them one more try. Ok sushi, ok prices Price: Basic rolls avg. $6 Other rolls avg. $12 Small Plates etc $8 Ramen $10  EDIT: I went back the next day and Huy the manager came to say hello. Again, top notch service. Ordered the Tuna Roll and Eel Avocado Roll. Huy sent over free dessert. My experience was much better today, the rolls were done right and I will return to Kabuki again for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"The most amazing squid - cooked to perfection.  Wow this place has delicious Japanese food. Edamame with sea salt to chicken teriyaki- it was awesome.  Sushi rice is also perfect.  Great place with a cool ambience."}
{"text":"Not as good as the one in Los Angeles. It's pricey but expected in a place like this. Unfortunately this is the second time I've had bad service even before the other half of our six member party showed up. Just didn't feel it was worth the 18% gratuity they added on. I'll stick to Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I've been to kabuki many times, this location is solid. During Phoenix summer months, ever where slows down but this place is consistent, that means the foods is consistent and good. I was here for Gen opening but decided to stop by here. Gen was too long, I got there at 8pm and it's busiest time of the day, I should have known to come earlier, lesson learned. Lol I think kabuki was extra busy today  because all the customers from Gen came I here because they didn't want to wait. Lol"}
{"text":"Lame like always, nothing especial. It feel like the chessecake factory of asia. They just help and pay attention to adult people just for the tips, they are all a tips grabers..... GIGIRY"}
{"text":"Place did not satisfy. Food does not come out as described on the menu and when you ask your server or bartender that you don't see a certain item they proceed to pick a fight with you, then they tell you after saying you don't want your roll any longer that \"were going to take it off this time but I just want to let you know that theres nothing wrong with it.\" Not sure what to think"}
{"text":"fun place to go for happy hour. Sevice is great. The Saki is good and thet have several specials all at excellent prices. located in Tivoli  which is a gorgeous shopping center the have a early and late happy hour"}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch my wife and I had here on a Friday afternoon. We were pleasantly surprised about how nice our experience was. We have always walked by and have never stopped in. I think it is a solid option for Japanese if you're in Town Square.  We came in just after 12 and were seated immediately. Both the restaurant and bar were busy but it wasn't loud, crazy, and hectic. Bernard was our server and he did a good job despite him running about 5 other tables beside us during the hour.   Their menu is extensive with lunch combos toward the back. You also get an order of edamame to snack on before your meal. I had the omakase deluxe combo (5 nigiri and 6 pieces of spicy tuna roll for $13.95) and a Vegas roll (deep fried salmon, crab, cream cheese, and avocado for $10.95). My wife had the Kabuki deluxe (chicken teriyaki, bbq beef ribs, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and 3 pcs California roll for $13.95). This was plenty of food for both of us. I had no issues with the sushi and I especially liked the beef ribs, they had a nice barbecued flavor and were tender.  I would come back to try more of the Japanese fare and I would come back for happy hour after a movie or before I headed to one of the bars to get a little food and to warm up the engine."}
{"text":"Being at the Tempe Marketplace for lunch meant that if we didn't have a unanimous decision on where to dine, we could go our separate ways, which is what we did. Four of our group went to Kabuki around 11 AM on a Monday.  Lisa was our server and she was outstanding giving us recommendations and keeping up with all our needs throughout the meal. I also noticed that she had two other tables of regulars at the time which speaks to the service she provides.  A new menu was rolled out for 2016 and I can't speak about the differences from 2015, but I do know that the menu size did not decrease and there was a focus on small plates and hot stone grill entrees. I ordered the garlic chili salmon poke bowl ($11.95) which consisted of many tasty ingredients that all seemed to work together, especially the garlic chili sauce with the salmon. Along with the accompanying bowl of soup, this was enough to fill me up. Another surprise was the kid's meals ($6.50-$7.50). They must have designed these meals for baby hippos because they were gargantuan and included a salad, rice, and a drink. Needless to say, none of the kids came close to finishing their meal. Also ordered was the tempura udon ($11.95).  Prices are slightly elevated and it was busy during our lunch, but the service or food quality were not sacrificed. I'd have no problem returning, especially with such a large menu left to sample."}
{"text":"This was far & away the worst sushi I have ever been served.  I wasn't even expecting much since kabuki is a chain, but even going in with a low expectation didnt help.   I kept my order very simple to hopefully get something safe & tolerable; a rainbow roll, spider roll, asparagus, and iced tea.    The unforgettable part of the meal was the rainbow roll. All of the fish were room temp to the touch with piece of fish cut jagged, falling off the roll, dried & discolored in some spots.  2 of the sections were completely inedible and I wasnt going to risk getting sick eating warm dry fish.  Honestly i was surprised a sushi chef would even consider serving sushi in that condition.  So gross.  Everything else ordered was just average or subpar.  Kabuki, Never again.    There is great sushi to be had in the area, but it's not going to be found at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience a while back and had another train wreck. Decided the food was too good to hold a grudge. The server spilled my wife's soup, partially on my wife's lap.  manager Gina showed up at the table and asked what my wife did to make the server nervous. Said we should probably leave. We are gone for good."}
{"text":"I had a california roll and tempura. It was so good. The place is very nice and clean, it looks super fancy.  Service is excellent. Sitting outside to enjoy the night was a plus. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"I was with shana w for this disaster of a visit. How can any place tell you to go away when they are still open? It wasnt like we were going to have a full dinner....just wanted a drink and maybe some soup. Mind you there were at least 4 other people at the bar we were so rudely dealt with. I cant imagine how a corporate restaurant could possibly have this policy."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, pretty good sushi in Las Vegas if you're shopping nearby.  As destination location?  No.  But my colleague and I liked it, got a ton of food for a pretty good price and left satisfied."}
{"text":"So I only gave 3 stars because of how dusty/dirty it is, strange? The food was good, the appetizer asparagus is delish! From the glass at the front entrance to every piece of glass in that place-boy does it need to be cleaned-like bad! The pedestals the glass are on are so dusty you can move your finger across and write a message! I don't know if I will be back due to the fact that I could t get past the dirty glass and dust."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, nothing fancy, just plain 'ol good Japanese food.  The service however, was not quite as spectacular. We were having lunch on a Thursday and there weren't very many patrons in the restaurant.  In addition, the server took it upon herself to add extra tip to my credit card receipt. I have a huge issue with this and they have yet to address it. Although it was a small amount, it is the principle.  Overall, decent food, poor service, and pay in cash."}
{"text":"Terrible. I don't expect the best sushi being in  Arizona. I expect it to be decent being where it is located and the fact that I didn't $30 on a plate of nigiri and a pork belly bao. The bao was more dry than the Arizona desert. The sushi looked old and had the texture of an old leather belt. The miso soup was even worse. Won't eat here again and recommend you don't either. Our server was a sweetheart though."}
{"text":"I love Kabuki sushi! it's one of my favorite sushi restaurants and definitely top in Vegas beside Nobu. Nobu is on it's own level though so yes, top sushi restaurant in Vegas is Kabuki! My gfs and I always have dinner once here every time we make a trip out to LV. The cocktails are amazing and so are the sake! They have an amazing variety of choices between the cocktails, sake and food. The vegas roll is pretty good here and so are all the other specialty rolls. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Kabuki  How many of you are tired of the same old restaurants you've constantly visited and are ready for a change? Well you are in the right place, I just so happen to be writing a review on the popular restaurant Kabuki.  For those of you that don't know what Kabuki is, it is a Japanese restaurant that serves exquisite sushi and other Japanese cuisines. There are multiple Kabuki restaurants located all over the United States and there are two located right here in Las Vegas! I have had Kabuki many times, as it is my favorite sushi restaurant and I just recently decided to visit again, but this time as a reviewer. Today I am going to review Kabuki's menu, their locations, and their atmosphere.   To some Kabuki's menu may seem a little over whelming as there is a variety of options to choose from, but I see their menu as appealing to everyone. Kabuki is known for their delicious sushi, but that is not all they have to offer. Kabuki is not just a sushi dining experience they also offer Japanese cuisine to help provide for everyone's wants and needs. Kabuki's menu of food is very easy to read and even shows some pictures of their food and their beautiful sushi rolls. Kabuki's menu also lists the prices for their food of course, and they are reasonable. The average prices range from anywhere of six dollars to thirty just depending on what you get. Not only does Kabuki provide an assorted menu of tasty looking food, but they also have great quality of food to show for it. Kabuki's sushi rolls are unique from other sushi places in Las Vegas and are well thought out; they have flavors and textures that compliment one and another. My favorite roll there is their spicy tuna crunch roll, it's slightly larger than average sushi rolls and is warmed up to wear it just melts in your mouth. Its contents contain spicy tuna, sushi grade rice, seaweed, cucumber, siracha mayo, and the outside of the roll has a certain breading to it giving it just the perfect amount of crunch.   Kabuki offers many locations in the United States including Nevada, Arizona, California, and Texas. There are currently two locations located in Nevada, one in Las Vegas and in Summerlin. Both of the Locations in Nevada are great spots for a restaurant! These two locations are easy to get to and are located in popular outdoor shopping malls making it a great spot to hangout out and grab something to eat after a long day of shopping. Unfortunately I have not yet been to the Summerlin location inside of Tavoli Village shopping center, but I have been to Tavoli Village and I do know it's a beautiful clean mall. I have however been to the Las Vegas Kabuki restaurant location located at Town Square. Town Square is easy accessible by being right off of the 215 freeway and is a fun hip outdoor shopping mall. You might think Kabuki would be hard to reach since it is inside of a mall, but it is not. Kabuki is on a corner of the mall making it easily accessible to people already shopping around the mall and it is also easily accessible to people just stopping by to chow down on some delicious Japanese cuisine.   The last thing I would like to share about Kabuki is their atmosphere. Kabuki's atmosphere can be simply summed up as laid back, but sophisticated. The inside of the Japanese restaurant is very clean and pleasant to eat in. I always feel very relaxed whenever I visit Kabuki and I can thank their perfectly dimmed lighting for that, making it just light enough to see where you're going and what you are eating. I also love Kabuki's restaurant color scheme, it is black and red making it very sleek and appealing. Kabuki's seating is also pleasing to the eye and is very comfortable making your meal even more enjoyable. A bonus, their bathrooms are always clean! Kabuki's atmosphere really goes above and beyond due to their amazing staff, as they generally do set the mood. From the second you walk into Kabuki you are greeted with kindness from the hostess waiting to seat you and the servers really make it an easy pleasurable time. I am always treated with respect from the servers in Kabuki and they are very amiable, they genially seem like they care. The servers never make you wait an outstanding time and periodically check up on you to see how you're doing and how the meal is. Another thing I really love about their servers is that they are never hard to flag down and whenever I need something it seems there always right there to assist me. Both the servers and the atmosphere make Kabuki a fun happy place to be at and they always have me coming back for more!  Overall, Kabuki Japanese Restaurant gets a ten out of ten from me. After reading this review I hope I encouraged you to get out there and try Kabuki or if you have already tried it, I hope this review made you want to go back. I strongly believe this restaurant has all of the qualities to make it a great restaurant including its variety of foods on its menu along with its quality of food."}
{"text":"Dined here with a group of friends. Our server guy seemed new. He couldn't answer questions about the menu and forgot things so we had to remind him. But overall nice kid. Food was pretty tasty. Not really my go to sushi place but I want to go back to try their ramen and poke bowls."}
{"text":"okay i have been here three times now and i have to change my rating for 4 to 5 stars. This place has become one of my all time fav's... i just love everything about it.. the ambiance, variety and presentation of food, service(much better since 1st chick i had) ..errythang !! :)  * two thumbs up like Ebert And Roeper**"}
{"text":"Vegetarian soup, vegetarian sushi, vegetarian this and that. Love how they have a special menu just for me. Hehe :) the food here is fabulous. Great customer service and atmosphere.  I can never go wrong with this place. The wait is awhile but it's worth it.. Never really had a problem. And if I did. They fix it right away, and always comp it for me. :)"}
{"text":"I've had sushi at a lot of places around the country.  Series of failures: - Seated without a waiter to the table within 4 minutes: we moved to the sushi bar. - Watered down miso soup. - Super watered down iced green tea - Ice cold edamame. - Not a single roll was rolled correctly: every one fell apart. - Sashimi was cut very thick - Sushi chef tried to hand us 6 plates at the same time: there's no room for more than 2 plates at the bar.  Fortunately for them we were just hungry or we would have walked."}
{"text":"My first time trying sushi during a company dinner. The restaurant was very nice and service was great. I tried the dynamite roll and it was delicious. I'll definitely head back the to try more dishes."}
{"text":"My entire family enjoys eating at Kabuki. The servers and staff are always friendly and on it.  Angie, Justin Denise and James are some of the best servers in Las Vegas. I should know, I do a lot of entertaining... Kabuki can get kinda busy, but they take the challenge and always provide great customer service!!!   If you want a killer cocktail, see Dianne at the bar.  She rocks!!!!  The restaurant manager Kim always walks around ensuring a positive customer experience.   Okay I sound like a commercial but I'm not. My colleagues and family all love eating here so we are \"some of the regulars\"..."}
{"text":"The ramen is nice and the sushi and rolls are very fresh. Its a nice environment to go out with someone to chill and eat."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food was ok fr me. Order the mussels appetizer& chicken wings. We accidentally spilled some drinks & they were all collectively attentive/ replacing everything rt away. The salmon tasted fresh but the deluxe tray that we got was just ok. They had an awesome kids selection too, this is not common for japanese restaurants. The servers were great but the hosts up front seemed like the both didnt wan2 be there. Came fr the valentines dinner thing & they were packed.. As xpected. The prices were awesome! Would have paid double elsewhere. I will come back again fr sure!"}
{"text":"I always like the food ALWAYS hate the service. They can't even pretend to show any customer service. I'm sitting here right now waiting for a to go order. The gentleman at the desk says the other guy will help me, the other guys says the the first guy will help me. Still sitting here sitting here waiting for my order and NEITHER has even bothered to acknowledge me. Atrocious customer service. Try any of the other restaurants here in town square unless you want to be treated like you don't matter. Getting ready to walk out now. Hopefully they will refund my money for the order i already paid for online. Last time I will ever come here."}
{"text":"Today was my 4th time going to Kabucki.  I have to say I have been quite happy with each time I have gone.  The food is good, the fish is fresh and the service is on point.  I have only sat at a table once.  The main dining room, has a Japanese Modern feel, but slightly lacking.  However, being in a mainly target demo of College students, I wouldn't spend too much money here as well.  Sushi bar - Excellent, this is were Matthew and I generally sit.  I have still been finishing a really boring no carb thing.  Great selections here and oddly good salmon and yellow tail.  I did try a new item on the app menu today.  Grilled calamari - eh :(  I don't recommend.    Rewards - They have a sign up membership.  I actually is worth it, If you happen to like sushi and like Kabuki.  We signed up and got our money's worth.  Seems like your eyes are always bigger than your stomach with sushi, so any money saved is a plus!  Also Sports fans,  there is a TV at the end of the sushi bar in addition to the bar."}
{"text":"The food is very creative and good quality and cheap. I went with my boyfriend late for dinner and we didn't have a reservation and the staff was great and so friendly. We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs make the rolls so quick. I absolutely loved the dragon roll they actually made it look like a dragon and it was fun. Also the kabuki roll with lots of fish on top, definitely would go back again"}
{"text":"The service was non-existent as well as the sushi I requested a Sashimi suggestion it literally came as if a microscope was needed to see it ironically it was fresh the Wasabi was fresh as I like but what's the point if they don't give you any food or any service what a shame I imagine you have to be drunk to appreciate this place and see what he's been on the drinks and I don't do that never did and I know good places that have fresh water fish and fresh Wasabi and more options and real Japanese people working there and I'll go there for the same price you actually get food with that said what a shame no service no food why bother I would hit the funny button on my post because it is pretty funny I think they're drunk to work there also..."}
{"text":"This is a nice looking restaurant, and the service is great.  The food was really just okay.   We ordered the tempura, and shishido peppers to start.  The tempura was very tasty, and the peppers were enjoyable, and pretty mild...until I ate a super sneaky extra spicy one.  My mouth was on fire for about 15 minutes.  I won't be ordering those again.  We also got two rolls- the Las Vegas, and the lobster roll.  I'm not usually a fan of the Las Vegas roll, but theirs was pretty good.  I was looking forward to the lobster roll, but it didn't have much flavor, and it was really messy.  I had to pick it up off the plate with both hands, and it was still falling apart.   The cocktails we had were just okay too.  Lychee sake mojito was just sweet, and meh.  The sangria was enjoyable.  It was kind of grapefruity, and slightly bitter, but it had a unique taste to it. I'd like to come again for happy hour, and try a few more things.  For now, I'm kind of on the fence about this place."}
{"text":"I have to say... It's refreshing when your expectations are met on a regular basis. Been to Kabuki many times and this is my first review. The food here is delicious. Never had s bad meal here. The prices are reasonable. They've got some unique menu items. The Sautéed Asparagus and Garlic Edamame are delicious appetizers. Sushi and Sashimi are great too. They've got lunch specials till 4pm with a good selection. Try it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not all sushi is equal, and if you enjoy specialty rolls you'll really want to do your research when selecting a sushi restaurant. We came here because we had picked up a friend at the airport, and were looking for lunch somewhere off-strip. This location is in Town Square.  The service was good and the staff was pleasant. We tried the garlic edamame and several of their specialty rolls. The edamame was good - a bit different from versions elsewhere. There were large pieces of garlic and what seemed like maybe almond slivers or something - it was crunchy. It was a nice contrast without being overly garlic in flavor.  The specialty rolls were all very good, although they were unique and not exactly what I would expect from a Japanese restaurant:  The Lobster Roll: 5 pieces of a California roll covered in big chunks of lobster in a sauce. The serving of lobster was generous, but I found the lobster to be a little chewy. I also found that the presentation made it difficult to get equal amounts of lobster on every serving. It tasted good, but I probably would not order this roll again.  The Lasagna Roll: 8 pieces of what I recall being a California roll, covered in mounds of cheese... yes cheese. Sounds strange I know, but this was amazing! I would order this over and over. It was listed on their specialty menu, so I am not certain that this is a year round offering. But it was probably our favorite roll. It was warm and creamy.  The Dragon Roll: I loved the tempura jalapenos on this! My friend worried that this roll would be too spicy for him (I happen to love spicy), but it was perfectly balanced and not too hot at all. The spicy tuna caked on top of the roll, with the addition of a little cream cheese was just the right amount to cool off any spiciness. I would order this again.  The Lava Roll: I am on the fence with how I feel about this roll. It had a good flavor, but it had tons of mushrooms and onion strings under clumps of mozzarella cheese. Definitely not what you'd expect with sushi, and although it tasted good, I don't think I'd order it again... it was A LOT of onions.  I do think I'll come back here, both because it's conveniently located, and because the service and food were both good. But there wasn't one stand out item we tried that will make me rush to come right back."}
{"text":"Went here with my bestie for a Friday night dinner. It was kinda busy.... but the wait was super fast and we actually were seated pretty quickly. The wait staff was very kind and we did not feel rushed at all in ordering or eating. I ordered a sake sangria and she ordered a plum wine. Both were amazing about about $7. The sangria was huge and definitely worth the money. She ordered gyoza and a California roll topped with lobster, masago, and eel sauce. I ordered the sushi special which had a CA roll, tuna, salmon, eel, egg, albacore, white fish, shrimp, and yellowtail. (and I might be forgetting one or two... it was a lot of sushi) The quality was good, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"We went for their anniversary special which was buy 1 get one for $1.  While the quality of the fish was fine, my gripe was more w/ the service here than anything else.  I ordered a cold bottle of sake and they bring out 2 room temperature bottles stuffed in crushed ice.  Am I supposed to wait an hour before this gets cold?  Sent that shit back.  Waiter seemed surprised I didn't want it!! They should've just told people they were out of it then.  It took 20 minutes for them to bring a mojito over and then they close down the bar so my wife couldn't even get her 2nd one for a $1.  The waiter never stopped to ask if we needed anything as I always had to hail him down as he was walking by.  Lame.  This was the first time in a long time where I tipped less than 10%...I hope most of it went to the sushi chef."}
{"text":"This is a very nice-looking classy restarant. However the sushi wasn't all that great. Ordered 3 \"basic\" rolls... eel roll, yellowtail roll, and spicy tuna roll. The eel roll was just ok but the spicy tuna and yellowtail were way, way, WAY overminced. The rolls were not rolled very tight either or maybe it was because the roll had no structure due to the overminced fish. They kinda fell apart when you picked one up. The overminced fish was like eating sushi roll baby food. Not a fan. Service very nice but won't be back next time I'm in town. Baby food sushi rolls are not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I must say that the quality of food and service are great. Prices are little much but I can honestly say that my family and I were impressed and satisfied. Good happy hour drinks and fresh rolls!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here this week after a very busy day. We were seated immediately, we placed our order got our drinks all within 10 minutes. Everything was exceptional and very affordable. The ginger house salad was huge and fresh. All of the rolls were exceptional. Easy to manage and eat. Great service, awesome food! The bill was $60.00 and i want to go back!!"}
{"text":"My husband stumbled upon this place for lunch while exploring Town Square.    First of all the decor is beautiful.  A casual, sheek place to dine with awesome prices.  It was just the two of us so we decided what the hell, let's try a happy boat.  OOOOOHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEE!  It was awesome...It came with shrimp and vegetable tempura, kalbi, chicken, salad, Gyoza and California Roll Sushi.  Everything was great.  I am definitely taking my kids here when we return in December.  The service is great and the prices are great for good Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a friend and my dog while I was visiting Vegas. I was worried about them accommodating the dog, but they didn't mind and set us up at one of the outside tables. It was really cold, but they had some outdoor heaters!  We got the salmon yaki onigiri, my friend had the tonkatsu lunch special, and I had the sushi moriawase lunch special, with a Philly Roll substitution. All of it was super yummy and affordable! I was able to buy for both of us for about $30. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the salmon yaki onigiri. It's heaven. All of the food was great quality. Even the rice tasted ridiculously good! I also love that the menu has more variety than most sushi places.  Service was awesome. I think our server's name was Travis. He did a great job!  It was an awesome way to wrap up my last day in Vegas. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst service I've ever experienced. The sushi was exceptionally overpriced for the 6 pieces you recieved, and none of it tasted fresh. I know that sushi is meant to be served at room temperature but I'm used to the cool crunch of the cucumbers and other vegetables which neither of my rolls had. The waiter never came back after serving our sushi and we were stuck with another waitress who barely spoke two words with us. We were only brought drinks once, then after waiting 20 minutes for our check after we finished, I stuck a 10 in the fold and left because the waitress didn't come back to retrieve it. I could've dined and dashed easily."}
{"text":"The food I had was OK but not great. We had to ask for everything we needed from other employees that seemed to be floating around the restaurant not doing much else other then saying they would let our server know.... I don't think they ever did because the same server only visited our table twice after we ordered. We got our appetizers, mains and sushi all in one, it wouldn't even fit on the table unless we took off the candle and yet the waiter just kept shoving stuff on the table. We never got drink refills till he came to give us our check. I'd never go back, the service was not good at all."}
{"text":"Was at the place with friends and really enjoyed everything. We had lots of varieties of food and couldn't even finish everything. The stuff was nice and helpful. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Happy hour pricing was great, but new menu and prices hikes are now in effect. Still great food. This Americanized sushi restaurant is still great. My favorite menu options consists of Sapporo beer, gold rush roll, potstickers and crab salad. Waiters are usually very friendly. And don't forget the Sake!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in Tempe. The prices are cheaper than other places I've been and the portions are much better. Every single roll is incredible. I love that they have a diverse menu - the teriyaki and ramen are great. Happy hour and reverse happy hours deals are fantastic! I have been here so many times and will continue to go here. Amazing food, good atmosphere, friendly service almost every single time."}
{"text":"I come here with my friends at least monthly for Happy Hour.  The service is great, the restaurant is clean, and the Dynamite Roll is mind blowing!  It is not on the Happy hour menu but it is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Crappy over priced food with horribly slow and unfriendly service. The waitress we had probably needed another 10 years of training. We waited longer than we actually ate. Could see my beard grow while waiting for to go boxes. Asked for three to go boxes and she comes back with two. The is fine. Took her another 10 minutes to get the third.Served with an attitude. When I asked the hostess at the front to get me a bag,  one was provided with much rudeness involved.   Dear Kabuki. Please train your people. Do not embarrass yourself.  Plus the cooking needs improvement."}
{"text":"We went to Kabuki to celebrate my Son's 16th Birthday. It was a busy nigh but the service was so impressive. The Manager (his name started with Z) was great, he made sure that we enjoyed our special night. They sang Happy Birthday to my Son and even made sure that my 9 year old son had his own ice cream. I really felt like they made our night special and I can't wait to go back. The level of customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"Had a great experience, The food was pretty good and I strongly recommend ordering the mango mochi ice cream. I would say this is a great place for a family dinner or if you wanna kick it with your boys at the bar !"}
{"text":"Kabuki has been one of my faves. Great customer service and atmosphere. Had the Seafood Udon and BBQ Beef Ribs, both were really good."}
{"text":"Usually a great place but I ordered a teriyaki beef plate cooked medium but got a plate of well done meat. I told the server that the meat was not cooked medium and he said he would get a new plate. It took about 30 minutes but when i looked at the plate it seemed as if the chef just put 2 pieces of medium cooked meat on top and the rest of the pieces were the re-used well done pieces of meat from the first order.  Whats the use of servers asking how you want things done if the cook is just going to cook it well done and then cheat the second time?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious sushi and great service. I ordered a glass of plum wine and the serving size was more than i expected which was great. The waitress was on top of things and refilled my water every time it got low."}
{"text":"We ate here all the time when we were in Phoenix. Awesome atmosphere and food. Very extensive menu. Everything we ordered was yummy. Phenomenal rolls. Yummy beer. Great date night place. I seriously miss this place. I wish I could find a place in Northern Virginia with sushi this good.  I'm going to cry now. Sniff sniff."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my bf on a Wednesday night around 9 ish. Our hostess who had long black hair dark skinned asian in her 20's gave us a booth towards the middle. I asked if I can sit towards the back instead. She got mad and rolled her eyes. Very rude.. When I sat down, I looked at her and she looked mad. Like hello? That's your job if a customer isn't comfortable sitting at the table you wanted them to they can switch to a different one if they want. Ever heard of customer is always right??? We just wanted to be comfortable that's all. It was a busy night and our food wasn't all that great. We ordered sushi and spicy ramen miso soup. It seemed as if they rushed it because it was busy. I don't care how busy it is I want to enjoy my dinner and their service here is horrible. I should've told my bf to leave with me when I seen that rude young hostess giving us attitude!!! If you dont like your job I suggest you should quit and not give customers attitude because I will tell everyone I know not to visit this place due to your bad service and food!!! Never again will I come back here I'd rather spend my money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I always go here when I visit Westgate. Super yummy place and a fun atmosphere. Came here with 20 of my family members and we had a great time. Must go place for those who are in the area."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Kabuki since they opened in Tivoli Village. My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar, and even when the bartender is swamped, she always makes sure to check on us and see if everything is OK.  Love the small tapas style appetizers and that we can get a pitcher of Sapporo and hot sake for cheap."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Japanese restaurant in the world! Been hooked since we entered the Hollywood branch several years ago and we've been going back every chance we get. The Love Boat, Lobster Dynamite, & Seafood Hibachi are just some of our favorites. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Japanese food."}
{"text":"I wanted to go here for the longest time, that being said I was disappointed. I have had better sushi  drinks and food at other places. The best thing I liked here was the salad. We paid 70 for two people, at those prices I could of gone to bennihanna, the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the location and the salad"}
{"text":"Wow I never use to like this place but for the last 3 times they have impressed me at 3 different location the sushi the yakisoba and the sushi rolls are amazing and the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick sushi fix. So while walking around Town Square, we decided to stop by Kabuki. We decided to sit at the bar and found out that we can order here as well! So glad we did because we got to meet Jay and Jeff. What a finny pair. They're sooo nice and made us feel so welcome. So attentive and made our quick stop so enjoyable.   We started with a lychee martini. Can't even taste the goose. Next was yummy miso soup. Next up was their salad with delicious ginger dressing.   Albacore crunch roll: Omg this roll was my favorite. Sooo good. The dried garlic and ponzu sauce in this dish was amazing.   Spicy tuna crunch roll: This dish was delicious too! Great crunch, perfect rice, and flavorful tuna!  Amaebi and Ebi: so fresh. I love this menu item. Order it every time I eat sushi. And it doesn't fail here. Perfectly fried shrimp heads. Like eating potato chips.  With Jay and Jeff, definitely one of our more enjoyable sushi night outs :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love kabuki! And I've always had such great service until just the other day I had a young waitress named Nikki, and I hate to say she was terrible! She never came to check on us more than twice for the whole hour and a half we were there. A completely different server brought us out food and helped us way more than the girl. When my friend asked for a refill after waiting 10 mintues this Nikki girl looked at her like you expect me to get you a refill. And when we asked for our check it took longer than necessary and while we waited we watched her stand behind the sushi bar talking with the chef and another waitress for at least five minutes while we were staring at her! I've never made a bad complaint about kabuki but this was by far the worst service be ever had here."}
{"text":"Really great food, fair prices and quick service.  The ramen was good,the broth was delicious and the most important thing but I look forward to the usually fragrant marinated egg with a custard yolk, their egg was not.  Very disappointed bc it was just a over cooked hard boiled egg with no seasoning. When a ramen places egg is good I always order extra.  All in all it was good place the broth made up for the bland ass egg.  So hopefully they'll read this and improve it"}
{"text":"We went during happy hour. The rolls were great. I loved the dumplings! Service was excellent....definitely going back. I love the edamame they bring to the table while you wait."}
{"text":"Second time here and it's just as great as the first time. The mozzarella tempura was surprisingly light and very flavorful. The yellow tail carpaccio was so fresh. I had a geisha roll, pyramid roll and a salmon roll. All were so tasty with wonderful presentation. The seaweed salad was equally tasty. The service was good and the atmosphere had just the right vibe. Overall I will definitely be coming back to try some of the other temping sounding things on their menu. I give it 4 1/2 stars. Half a star off for the paper napkins we were given. Every other table seemed to have linen ones.  Strange"}
{"text":"Awesome flavors and just the right amount of spice and kick. Had the Alaska rule, albacore crunch roll, king crab with cucumber wrap. Only thing we ordered that we would not get again was the dynamite appetizer. Kabuki is consistent with quality food and the service tonight was better than ever before though we always thought it was decent."}
{"text":"If I could give  half a star I would because I just had the most unacceptable experience at this location the manager Joe was a complete unprofessional rude and insulting individual.  We had such a wonderful order the last time we were here and order the same thing with totally rubbery disgusting chicken served to us today and not only did our drink order  never get filled but he had he nerve to insult us by stating that we didn't say anything soon enough.  We literally waved our hands for five minutes and waited for 10 minutes trying to get our servers attention who never even checked on us once our food arrived. I am a sales manager and this is completely unacceptable... When I asked to speak with his manager who was in the restaurant he said that he was only authorized by the manager to give a $1.70 discount . Shocked ."}
{"text":"In a word: CONSISTENT.  Vegas food has consistency problems. BUT, i like Kabuki because the food quality is always the same, and its pretty good. The service on the other hand has hiccuped more than thrice... tonight was no exception.   NOTE TO HOSTESS: if you're getting slammed and are short staffed, say so. if there are 5-6 open tables and you're not seating anybody, it is not because there are two couples waiting to be seated that there is a 20 minute wait, its because you're in the weeds and you might not know what to do in this situation because this might be your first job.... and that's cool. Just lose the attitude and help find solutions rather than spend energy trying to assign blame.   Happy hour specials rock. quality of food is surprisingly good, but i do echo other reviewers in that the roll menu is a bit thin. However, the nigiri portions are pretty large and the ahi tuna is usually a nice rich deep pink/purple. I never get any fishy tasting portions which has been a staple of almost eery other place i've been in vegas."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the quality based on a delivery order. Good quality sushi, cut generously and prepared beautifully.  The Saba was average, but the Maguro, Hamachi, Kaibashira (Jumbo Scallop) were all excellent.  The Tokyo steamed bun was not as good as a traditional Taiwanese Gao Bao but was still enjoyable.  The Miso Black Cod was excellent.  Wonderful delivery packaging, the gyoza appeared in a attractive box, that looked like I had ordered a nice box of chocolates. They provide wasabi soy dipping bowls which is always a win when you are traveling.  Kabuki delivery via Eat24 or Seamless sure beats hotel room service."}
{"text":"the ramen is good~~~ so is the service~ next time I will try the sushi~"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, good value!  I left happy and will return."}
{"text":"First, the food was Aaawesome!!!  The service. I literally had to get up and find the manager.  After telling him, how long we sat out side, just waiting, on a waiter to ask for our drinks.  Umm...which was 23mins!! Overall, the food was fabulous!  Great outdoor mist to cool you off, from the AZ heat."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good representation for Japanese food in America. I had a tonkatsu meal with tempura and my wife had an American sushi roll and an inarizushi. The tonkatsu was cooked well but would have preferred some fatter pork - I love marbling. The tempura was light and not overly battered and oily, which was done really well. I think some of the vegetable tempura pieces were not cooked enough but the shrimp was perfect. The miso soup was lacking and seemed to be the typical instant miso soup with barely anything in it. I didn't try the Americanized maki that my wife had but helped with the inarizushi which tasted good. The service was above average but nothing special - drinks were refilled in a relatively timely manner and we were checked on.  Overall, I scored this lower since I am kind of picky with Japanese food having lived in Japan and growing up with Japanese food as well as going to Japanese restaurants from Japan, Guam, Hawaii, California, and other US metro areas, but this is a place I would go to again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Went there for an out of state work function and the staff was pretty rude.  Our waitress, \"Kim\" was so rude I almost backhanded her.  The co-worker next to me asked for more water and this waitress just stared at her for 5 seconds and then quickly grabbed her glass and then slammed it down and walked away.  When the waitress came back to take our order she was really short and very snotty.  Her tone of voice was patronizing and she made it seem that we were out of line for asking questions about the menu.  A bunch of us wanted to approach management and complain but didn't think it was worth it.  I really could not believe how snotty this waitress was.  If you go, you will enjoy the food but avoid that waitress if you can."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Fantastic service! The Cilantro Albacore roll was one of the best rolls I have ever had. I will most definitely return next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Good sushi. The buffet they have seems like a deal. Wasn't wowed, but I thought it was solid"}
{"text":"Over priced, ramen is horrible, rude waitress and waiters. Pretty sure I got FOOD POISIONING again. Wasnt sure the first time because I felt sick after. Went again and for sure the same vomit sensation after eating there again. I do not eat any raw food either. I only ate things with out raw. Probably cross contamination with veggies in the back unsanitary or the sushi preps dont care. I had the seaweed salad so it might be that. Feeling so sick. Stomach cramping, cant sleep and its now 5am about. Not eating here again. Very dissapointed because I wanted to order a veggie sushi platter but now wont be. Ill be making it at home instead where I wont get food poisiong. NOTFUN!"}
{"text":"I went here tonight with a few friends to celebrate our finishing a final. We went for the reverse happy hour and it was alright... not the best, but ok. I got a couple creamy peach saketini that were on 'special' for 6.25. Still pretty steep for the drink. It was tasty, I just thought it was overpriced. I also got the gyoza (on special for 5$) and a house salad. The gyoza were pretty good, I liked the sauce that was on them. The salad was fine... It was just a romaine mix, probably from a bag, with a ginger dressing. I liked the ginger dressing, but it was kind of only on the top of the salad. Overall, it was just ok. The service was also alright, some people didn't get their food when they should have (they forgot someone's dish AND brought out the wrong rice, she ordered chicken teriyaki and said it tasted like the sauce was out of a bottle AND I thought it was ridiculous that they charged like 12$ and gave you dark meat... really? That is insanity. +2$ for white meat.) The prices here were just laughable, if I had gotten a real meal it would have cost at least 10$ but i'd say the average for non sushi was 15$....not worth it.  I would definitely not come back here if it weren't happy hour."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Pretty atmosphere, wonderfully attentive waiter, and reasonably priced with good portions.  We had, between the four of us, the salmon poke bowl, tuna bowl, and a few rolls. Everything was so delicious!  We went there on the recommendation of some friends, and loved it! We will certainly go back and bring friends, as Tivoli is magical, and Kabuki-awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for a decent price! Not to cheap but nor is it a wallet drainer. The happy hour has wonderful staples such as spicy tuna roll and sashmi at great prices. The rolls are large and plump. I've been around to many local sushi spots and this so far has the finest taste.   Steve was my server and he was excellent. Friendly, cool, and filled with smiles.    The kid's coloring menu was cool, colorful, and engaging."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 8, I had a good time and the food was great.  BUT, they forgot my yakitori order.  So this review went from a 5 star to a 1 star.  I know I'm being harsh, but, at this point I stopped caring. I still gave the server a 15% tip since he didn't include it in the bill bc he forgot about it. But I did mention it like three times."}
{"text":"We got here at 9:10pm and was seated at 9:15pm. There were parties that was seated after us and got there food within 15 mins. At 9:30pm I had to get up and go to the front and tell the other hostess that we have been waiting for 15 minutes for our server to come. Our server came right away and told us that he was not informed by the other lady hostess that sat us. What got me more angry was that there was a group of four that came in and was seated right away and ordered there food right when it was the time for their last call. They received their food before us! What in the world! And when our food came it was cold!!! I come here a lot but now I am thinking about not coming here at all"}
{"text":"This place is a legit classy but not too expensive restaurant. The food and prices here are amazing. Quality is key and the put a lot of good quality in their flavors and a good portion of food as well. Their sushi was fresh and their teriyaki meats are delicious. If you are looking for a chill somewhat classy kind of dinner night but don't want to spend a ridiculous amount of money this is the spot! Service here was great servers always checking on their tables and everyone is in a great mood."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have lunch special and happy hour at the same time when we went in.. Very good food and the place is pretty nice and the stuff are really nice as well.. We will come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We visited while on our honeymoon. We arrived just as Happy Hour was ending. The restaurant honored the Happy hour prices. We ordered 6 different sushi rolls and 2 appetizers. The sushi was the best we had all week. The calamari rings were the most tender we've had since visiting the ocean years ago. The other appetizer, sesame chicken, was delicious.   Would have given 10 stars if it was an option. We ate at a casino sushi restaurant and had twice the bill for half the food."}
{"text":"Always love coming to kabuki during happy hour. Vegas roll is always a must for me. Never been disappointed and a pro that we always get edamame before our food comes out without being extra."}
{"text":"Great food and service! A nice gentleman, I think the manager,came out and helped us with the cake, took our pics, and brought Brianna a Birthday ice cream dessert! Bri loves sushi  and they have some of the best!!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a whim one night.  We were seated promptly by a friendly waiter. The staff seemed friendly enough but they just seemed a little off to me, as if they weren't all accustomed to working with each other. The team chemistry was off.  In any case, my boyfriend and I got a few rolls and the sashimi salad. Now, if you know me, you would know that I NEVER ever order rolls. I only did that here because they were on happy hour and I was hungry. The rolls themselves are decent for the price, albeit messy and uneven, especially for a restaurant that is normally quite pricey. We got the spicy tuna roll, rose roll, and something else. All the rolls were decent and fresh but fairly unremarkable.  The sashimi salad actually had more fish than I was expecting! What a pleasant surprise. It was pretty standard fare but I always love the dressing so I gobbled that up.  My boyfriend ordered a sapporo and I got a sake sangria. The sangria had a lot of yummy fruit and got me feelin' good because I started drinking on an empty stomach. Yay happy hour!"}
{"text":"Better than average sushi w/nice selection in wonderful ambience.  Veggie food leaves a lot to be desired.  Nice salads, ramens and cooked Japanese dishes.  Friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"My server was actually great.  Spicy tuna roll was pretty good and I love the miso soup as do my kids.  My kids usually like teriyaki chicken/beef so we got a combo lunch special and I had to force them both to eat a few bites at the very least, just kind of weird.    My problem was when the bill came and I used a coupon that was mailed to me in a Tempe Marketplace mailer with coupons.  I read the coupon VERY carefully for stipulations before arriving at the restaurant and saw what I was planning was qualified.  When I gave the coupon to the server he informed me that his manager told him to tell me that even though it wasn't stated on the coupon we had to have a minimum purchase of $30.  I asked to speak with the MGR who again told me that he was sorry but that some people come in and only spend $10 and then he doesn't make any money (how is this my problem?) I told him that the coupon was the sole purpose of my choice to eat lunch here today and try it out and if this is my first impression of your restaurant this does not make me want to return.  He apologized again and I said you should really put a sign up at the very least and even that would leave bad taste in my mouth but was better than nothing.  He informed me there was a sign up.  I paid my bill and did not punish my server with the tip as I so wanted to but knew it wasn't his fault.  I then looked for the signage for the coupon on my way out the door and could not find it anywhere.  I left the restaurant looked around and then re-entered the restaurant and eventually found it where we never walked by when we were seated.  Very poor management as far as I'm concerned and I won't return.  I do have to mention the mgr did offer on my way out to buy me dessert however my kids had an appt. and we didn't have time.  If you are going to offer me a $5 dessert why not just accept my coupon and go the extra $5 to make me happy and want to return?  So for a lousy $10 they lost a return customer and I will probably spread the word whenever this restaurant comes up in passing or conversation.  Oh yeah and on YELP!"}
{"text":"Peter.   He's the best!  Set the scene...it's St. Patty's Day.  I've been engaged for going on 72 hours, and my fiancé and I are finally getting to celebrate sans baby.  We've had a few already, but I am in desperate need of food before having a few more.  Whether it was because it was a holiday, or because it was a Sunday, none of the bar/grills were still serving food, except for Kabuki's.  Trent is not really a fan of sushi, and I'm not really a fan of Arizona sushi, but what do we have to lose?  Everything we had was derishious!  So shockingly surprising.  And not overpriced, unlike everything else in this mall.  Even the booze was affordable.  We both left full and sufficiently more buzzed than when we go there for about $65 and that was after a generous tip (something along the lines of 30%).  Not too shabby!  Thank you, Peter, for making our visit an experience to last a lifetime!"}
{"text":"Have tried Sake, sushi, and Chashu Ramen here today. All taste great! The chefs at Sushi bar are all Japanese, so the Sushi is very fresh! I came in at happy hour time, so price is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place. The location and the sushi is top notch. It's our favorite. I highly recommend it.  The reverse happy hour is the best and it keeps your bill lower."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I inquired about the vegan options and was assured everything was vegan except they said that there could be cross contamination in the tofu because it is made from an outside vendor.  I told the waitress that did not make sense (ultimately she was throwing her vendor under the bus) and she just sent the manager over.  I talked to the manager and wanted the fried tofu for my daughters and she told me the oil is the same that fries the fish.  I asked for it to be pan fried and her response was 'usually we don't but I will this one time just make sure you never ask for it again.'  I was floored.  Then to top it off as all the food was getting delivered she told me 'by the way I cancelled your order'.  She did not offer to make me something else.  We walked out at that point.  Go to town square- a million times better."}
{"text":"Much better experience at this location than at the town square location. Kind of a long drive from Henderson so I have to contemplate our continuous sushi craving.. but very satisfied with the service and food. YUM kabuki"}
{"text":"I am a kabuki usual. Moved from cali and always went to the local one. So imagine my excitement when I found one in Vegas.  This one is pretty small. Walked in and was told we needed to wait 5 minutes. I'm thinking no problem, it's near the airport, and Vegas is tourist city. When we were finally seated (only 3 of us) the entire dining area had 3 tables full, the rest were empty.. why did I have to wait 5 minutes. Ordered a couple of the usual. Calamari, BSCR.. the Calamari here is better than one in cali. The BSCR here tho is not as good. When paying I gave our waitress our rewards card where I have a $15 birthday credit, And because their member system wasn't working was told I wouldn't be able to use it. The manager said I could get $5 off..uhm no, that ain't happening because it expires in 2 days. After about 5 minutes the manager finally said that she could remove few items from the bill. I don't appreciate all the drama that amounted because the system wasn't working.. it's not my fault. I probably won't come to this one, I'll have to try the summerlin location to see if I should venture all the way from Henderson or if I should find a new sushi place."}
{"text":"My review is semi biased because we received HORRIBLE service.  So we were here on Father's day and they had a sign outside that said they had 1/2  off sushi during happy hour.  We arrived about an hour before HH started, so we decided \"hey lets wait an hour to get 1/2 off!\"  An hour passes and we stroll in and ask about their happy hour and they told us that there isn't a happy hour today because apparently Father's day is a national holiday and there is NO happy hour on national holidays!  Geez thanks for advertising it with a huge freakin sign outside.... We still decide to eat here because we're starving by now and ordered some food.  We got the ribs and some yakisoba.  The ribs were pretty tasty, but kinda chewy and fatty.  The yakisoba was wayyy too salty for me. We noticed our ribs didn't come with rice so we asked them where it was.  The waiter told us that we didn't order the meal when clearly we did because he gave us soup and salad before...  We told him this and he still refused to give us rice unless we paid extra.... Just a mixture of the false advertisement and charging us for rice ruined my meal just a tad.  The food was ookay, but not memorable.  Probably not coming back here for a while."}
{"text":"It's good food but it does get busy so if you're in a rush or mind waiting then I would suggest you wait until you have more time or just not at peak hours."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant, but sushi is just a little but better than what u can find ready made at the grocery store, and service is bad."}
{"text":"We finally came tonight after the husband has been wanting to go FOREVER. I have been here once before but both locations (Tempe and Westgate) always seem impossibly far from our CenPho home. I don't want to work that hard for some sushi and usually only go if in the area. This location is in Tempe Marketplace so you can mix sake bombers with a little blurry retail therapy after. I had joined their Kabuki club and they frequently send me coupons for various occasions (family birthdays, anniversary, monthly specials). The menu is typical of most Japanese spots but there is also a lot of variety. For apps, we had the fried calamari and the garlic edamame. I usually only have regular edamame (which they bring out complimentary) but the garlic ones were addicting...I was literally licking the oil off my fingers and scrounging for the diced garlic in the bowl. I only stopped when the server came by to check. I am such a garlic junkie. I wasn't so much a fan of the thick batter on the calamari but the wasabi sauce it came with was really good. Not very spicy but with a nice kick. I had the Philly roll ($5.25) and the Jumbo Volcano app ($8) that was crab, avocado and spicy tuna baked with a little eel sauce on the top. I would definitely have that again. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat more of the Jumbo Volcano because I gorged myself on the apps. We took the chocolate mousse dessert home (used our complimentary dessert coupon). It had fruit on the side and was filled with white chocolate. I could have eaten that one for days and was foiled when my husband decided to eat half...curses!! Anyways, I like the atmosphere and I think the prices are average. It looks like they also have reverse happy hour which is always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Had date night here and it was pretty good. We sat at the bar and had Joe and Liam take care of us. Joe kinda took the lead and his service was 5 stars!  We literally ordered every specialty drink on the menu and they were all tasty. Nothing to wow you here, but the drinks were good, the service was excellent and the food was really good. I gotta admit i have had better sushi and the prices are just a tad high and they were a little slower than i liked getting the food out the kitchen, but we'll more than likely be back soon. Great service goes along with me, If ou never tried a lychee fruit.... do it while your there. Your welcome.   P.s. please get bar stools that have a back on them."}
{"text":"I went back to Kabuki, as promised.  Boy have things changed in two weeks!  They no longer have a reverse happy hour, though their website still said so on Friday, June 13, 2008, which is the date I dined there.  The service was slow and very rude.  I felt that the server was disappointed we decided to eat there.  The hostess was also very rude and avoided eye contact, tossing our menus onto the table and turning around before introducing any specials or saying a server would be right with us or something.  It also took almost 20 minutes to receive our check at the end of our meal, though we were one table out of only about eight that were left among several servers.  Several servers were also gathered around a table of guests seated near us, laughing and chatting, while the rest of us waited for service.  This experience was so terrible for the boyfriend and I that we will not be returning again.  What a turn for the worse!  Forget everything I said in that first review; now this place has shown its true colors!"}
{"text":"I know they don't have quality sushi but I love to go here for their spicy tuna during their happy hour. Probably cause it's way cheaper and it still tastes good and it's conveniently located in Town Square. Movie and happy-hour (3-6pm) dinner always sound great to me.  My last visit wasn't so hot because of their Red Mask Club system that wouldn't let me use my birthday + earned rewards. I earn the rewards from all my previous purchases and my birthday was just the annual $15 off your order. Wouldn't let me combine and then they also weren't able to put my points for that meal on either. It was quite a hassle in the end and just didn't make sense. Bleh.  Service is usually decent/mediocre. There's not really anything special about this place but for the sake of convenience and decently-priced happy hour, I do go back often enough."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm!!! Okay first things first I adore sushi so I'm a little biased here- but the food is awesome and you CANNOT beat the happy hour prices!! Spicy tuna rolls and Philadelphia rolls for 3.95!! Can't be  beat. I have gone to places before with cheap sushi rolls for happy hour that are crappy- but these are awesome and have a great amount of fish! Really nice environment as well and in such a fun center for a date night."}
{"text":"A bit disappointing. The quality just wasn't that high. The kabuki roll had a mix of toppings, including salmon, tuna, salmon eggs, and more...the thing is, none of it was very good. I can't say that a single topping really stood out as being particularly good, and the salmon eggs were a big disappointment. The eel nigiri had too much sauce on it. Not very good."}
{"text":"We arrived and sat in the very small bar area.  It was over 10 minutes until the first contact.  We almost left because of the lack of service.  Once we were helped, the service improved considerably as we were regularly checked on.  Anyway, we were there for happy hour which was a great deal.  The food was good quality and great value."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is always amazing. Highly recommend!  I love the new happy hour meny, the aspargus salmon roll is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"On point!!! I dont know how people are saying its overpriced....for the quality, presentation,,and AMOUNT of food they give you, its right on the money!!! We ordered 3 kids meals (all were beef yakisoba & it came with a side salad & a pretty bowl of fruit cocktail. Pictures don't do it justice, because the plates were full sized & FULL of food. We also ordered a Spicy Seafood Udon plate & Spicy Miso Ramen Combo w/ Spicy Tuna Rolls (6pcs).  Husband loved his Udon & actually ate everything. I saw large meaty mussels, scallops, shrimp, & calamari from my side of the booth. I tasted it and they actually put enough spice to make me happy. Normally, people skimp on that.  My spicy miso ramen surprised me. Since I found the ramen combo on the back of the menu, I thought I'd just get a smaller bowl...but it was large and filled 3/4 full of deliciousness. I ordered spicy tuna rolls for the combo. Nothing fancy, but good. I was full before I even got to the rolls! Service was good, & atmosphere was enjoyable! AND the kids even loved their food, which is a bonus. Would definitely love to come back again! If you don't want to spend money, then there are smaller places to eat at here at West Gate. But in my humble opinion, it was well worth it. My ramen/sushi combo was $8-something for the spicy miso & $3-something for the 6 pieces of spicy tuna. Each kids plate was $8.95 (I think). Can't remember how much the udon was....but the seafood was big & meaty and cooked to perfection, so my husband says it was well worth the money! Give this place a shot if you want some good Japanese food from bigger than a hole in the wall. (Though home in the wall places are awesome too!)"}
{"text":"The staff and food was great.the only reason it only got three starts is because the manager Zhen was rude and gives the customers he interacts with dirty looks. Dillan and Louis were amazing and gave our group excellent service. We were traveling on business and would not recommend this restaurant when they are in a wait as the managers get very stressed out and do not treat customers well"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. It is conveniently located at Town Square near the strip. The menu has a wide variety of rolls and other tasty dishes. I recommend the Vegas Roll, California Tempura Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Sweet Potato Fries, and Tokyo Quesadilla. I've taken family there and everyone ends up enjoying it and wanting to go back for more. The service is usually very good, but like every restaurant they have some off days. I stopped by with some family on Christmas Day and it seems like they were not expecting it to be so busy because the service was exceptionally slow, not a big deal for me because we already knew what we wanted and did not need too much attention from our waiter. Overall it is a great restaurant and I recommend going!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now and was quite impressed. Not only do they have a nice atmosphere (plus patio) for dining, but quality sushi.  Their sashimi cuts are nice and generous which is something that really stands out to me. I absolutely love the Kabuki roll-its  a crunch roll with each individual piece topped with a different cut of fish(salmon, tuna, smelt). Really amazing!!  I like sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs make their masterful sushi art!  Great job Kabuki - you have won me over!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for something not too heavy since the heat in Vegas can be suffocating. Had the Lychee Lime Saketini (see picture) which delivered a sweet lychee taste followed by a vodka kick..really good.  The meal: -Geisha Roll: 3 stars, fresh fish and nice sauce -Kabuki Roll: 3.5 stars, liked the combo of fish -Lotus Roll: 3 stars, another refreshing roll  Service want top notch but otherwise it was just an average dining experience."}
{"text":"Really great food, really great service, really great cocktails! One star off for having literally the worst chopsticks on the planet. They hurt your hands, splinter easily and don't pick up food very well (and Yes, I'm a proficient chopstick user). Please get new ones!"}
{"text":"I love this place, my girlfriend and I always go here. Everyone is always friendly and I live the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Justin provided great service as well as some delicious suggestions. Everything from the tuna tartare to the speciality rolls and the yakisoba noodles was excellent!"}
{"text":"Even though it's not \"cool\" to like chain restaurants, Kabuki is one of my favorite sushi places in the Phoenix area. the seafood is always fresh and the fish is sliced thick (not like at Ra... don't even get me started on their pitiful sushi). I'm not a huge fan of their specialty rolls -- I just don't get the appeal of cream cheese with sushi or huge fried rolls, so I usually just stick with the basics like nigiri or spicy tuna roll or the rainbow roll.  The reason they don't get 5 stars from me is because I wish they had more specialty rolls that incorporated fresh fish WITHOUT cream cheese or fried things.  The wait is never that long here, the atmosphere is fun, and I also like that they serve you complimentary edamame with your meal!"}
{"text":"I eat here an average of 3x a week. They have amazing vegan and gluten free options, which makes it easy to accommodate even the pickiest of eaters! I have yet to bring someone here that hasn't enjoyed it. Affordable and delicious! Make sure to ask for Supa - she is amazing and makes great recommendations :)"}
{"text":"Waiting for our movie to start my husband and I decided to stop in here for lunch/dinner. The hostess gave us three options on where to sit. We decided to do the bar are due to the suggestion of catering to us faster. The waitress was also our bartender and was very helpful. The restaurant overall is very nice and the atmosphere is intimate."}
{"text":"The bartender David was exceptionally knowledgeable of the menu and catered to my taste with suggestions such as the albacore crunch roll and lobster dynamite. He paired my meal with a peach saketini which was delicious. The food came out promptly and was prepared beautifully. This place is really classy and inviting. It is somewhere I'll invite girls for a night out, or have an intimate dinner with my mate. Can't wait to to revisit."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi I've ever had! I didn't even use soy sauce, which I almost always use.  The Baja Roll was great, just the right amount of spice!  Happy Hour is a very affordable way to go but I'd definitely go again and order some higher priced rolls."}
{"text":"There's not a lot to say about this place. Sushi is overall good but the problem I had was the rolls were jam packed with rice. The rice tasted like minute rice, not sushi rice - ugh! The service was not good, they cannot handle larger groups.   For food, I would stick with the small plates. Calamari was good, gyoza and sesame chicken really great. Brussels sprouts were also amazing!"}
{"text":"Not my ball of seaweed. Yep, chain, went in with lowered expectations. Tried to adjust the bar accordingly knowing it wouldn't be as cheap as some of my favorites or as innovative as the more expensive places. But I still wanted a mediocre experience and a decent happy hour.  I was underwhelmed even for expecting mediocre. Though the ingredients themselves tasted ok, the sushi was not wrapped well. Falling apart at the touch, it left us with sloppy soy solution invaded by floating what-nots that spilled off the tops and insides of our rolls. Not to toot my horn, but I'm no chop-stick novice, this wasn't a lack of form on my part. Overkill on the mayo and underkill on the take-away impression.  Would I ever go back? Sure. If a coworker schedules a happy hour here, if an acquaintance to whom it would be inappropriate to warn against choosing such a place plans a birthday party here, I'll go."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is their strongest selling point here, and I wish it was longer (both in time AND with variety!) For the items they do have on happy hour are excellent and filling, but would also like to see a couple more options sushi wise added.  Service is lively and friendly, though there was one server we had not too long ago who was aloof and not open to passing conversation, but besides from that guy everything was great!  The only con I would say is their happy hour drink menu; all three times we've went there to order drinks off the menu, they either made them too sweet or prepared the wrong one. Servers don't seem very familiarized with drinks in their restaurant, that could be something they should work on.   I love to go there for the happy hour only, it's a great deal and you get stuffed for the amount you get. However, I wouldn't eat there if happy hour isn't going on. Everything else on the menu is otherwise overly priced for being a sushi bar on the strip. :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the seriousness of the night and the topic the little lady presented me but I didn't have as an enjoyable time as I did last week.  No details, just quick notes mainly for myself:  - Skip the Sauteed Mushrooms.  It's literally just white onions and mushrooms being sauteed in sesame oil and sesame seeds.  I could do this at home! - The Poke Tuna portion is ridiculously small. - No oysters until October.  Upon questioning why this is, no answer was given.  Boo. - Spider Roll:  Falls apart but not bad.  It's kinda of like trying to pick up tapioca with your chopsticks.   - Dragon Roll:  Too much unagi sauce, slightly small. - 10:15PM is when they turn on the lights and try to blind you out.  On the way out, you can watch the waiter counting their tips gleefully.  This made me laugh. - The mango Chu-Hi is really tasty though... even better than the Tokyo Mojito.  Cheers.  $60 bill and only the cocktail was enjoyable."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.  A short drive away from the strip, but way way worth it! Here's what I had:  1. Deep fried calamari with eel sauce. Perfectly crunchy, not too chewy. It was the perfect start to a good meal. 2. Spicy ramen. This broth was really tasty. I've eaten at many ramen joints, but this broth is actually quite spectacular and savory and complex. It wasn't at my desired spiciness level, but the waitress left a bottle of ground chili to bring it to my liking. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but definitely wished there was a piece of char siu in it, or some kind of meat. 3. Sunkissed roll. Spicy tuna roll with salmon and avocado on top. This was my favorite dish of the meal. I am a huge fan of sashimi and fresh fish. The spicy tuna was okay, but what made me happy and brought me joy was the huge piece of fresh and tasty raw salmon atop the roll. Certainly some of the freshest salmon I've tasted.  I was so happy with this meal, especially having been deprived of good sushi for about half a year. The total for the ramen and roll was ~$22. Definitely a steal compared to those other pricey places on the strip."}
{"text":"Very good food. Wish the atmosphere and wait staff were more authentic, but the food? WOW! Very good and the sushi was exceptionally fresh. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"I go hear a lot. Staff recognize me and are generally very prompt on service. Place seems clean. The bar appears closed at lunch. Menu has a variety of items."}
{"text":"Kabuki specifically at Town Square... Dinner, lunch, happy hour always hits the spot. Fresh and great service. Also great for big groups bc they never have an issue separating the checks. Went today for lunch, our server Andrew was just so pleasant and attentive: always checked on us, made suggestions and always had our drinks topped off. And lunch menu was great with large portions for such affordable prices."}
{"text":"Ok I read all the 4-5 star reviews and I do not understand what happen to our visit when we went. One night we were walking all the stores in the area and decided to try eating here. Once seated and looking over the menu we did not know what to order.  A lot of items were different than what we have ordered before. We decided to both order a dish they make instead of getting any sushi. All I can say is the dish me and my husband ordered we did not like.It was like a seafood mixture which was like fried or something. The combination and flavor was not what we enjoyed.(Photo below) Not sure what it was called.  If we go back I think we need to try the sushi instead of what you order off the menu because a lot of the photos I have seen the sushi looks much better than what we had. We may try it again sometime and I will update our experience then. I love Japanese restaurants so I was a bit upset that we left not liking what we ordered  (if your a local and have ate here and have had something you really enjoy message me I would love to know what to get! Thanks!)"}
{"text":"Kabuki offers the one sushi that I haven't been able to find anywhere else in town or in NYC, the elusive Baja roll. It's essentially a spicy California roll topped with crab and salsa drizzled with yum-yum sauce. Sounds a little weird I know but it the most unique blend of cuisine-Japanese and southwest.   Now as for general service, it's usually crap. It takes forever for anything, mainly the check. There were many a times when I felt tempted to walk out because it was ridiculous to even get the server's attention. I did not do such a thing but if left unattended as such could cause problems, and we all know that hurts the restaurant.  Now, the reason I put four stars is because the other day a friend and I went and had the BEST service. I believe the server's name was Robert, but forgive me I am mistaken because he made our night! Super attentive, funny, and on his A game. Kabuki, this is who you want you wait staff model.   As for the sushi chefs, in the past I've sat at the sushi bar are they are a jolly bunch who know their skills.  Arigato gozimasu."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the sushi is always decent.  Not the best sushi ever, but definitely decent.  It's one of many Valley sushi restaurants that are fine for getting a sushi fix, but not if you're looking for a stellar sushi experience."}
{"text":"Great spot in Tempe markets place to have a very good meal!!!! Great veggiterian options and great atmosphere!!! There is a roll for whatever anyone is craving and big plates with a combination of stuff for those with a bigger appetite ready to eat a lot !"}
{"text":"Went to Kabuki because I love sushi. Their have the Dragon roll, that look like the dragon lay on the plate. The Dynamite, that was a perfect combination by beaked clam, scallop, mushroom and vegetables with kabuki mayo sauce. It was delicious dish when you put it in your mouth, you can feel the fatty and aromatic of dish.  Friendly service and cozy place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff.  My family and I have been going to Kabuki for years almost on a weekly basis.  I think the food is high quality and won't go anywhere else for sushi.  The manager Tom is awesome always making sure our food is right and has become like family.  I can't go without saying the servers like Travis, Tim, Drew, Diane, and. Angie (Ok all the staff) have made this place feel like home but without the mess of washing dishes LOL!!!. Our favorite is getting Hamachi and salmon sashimi thin sliced. Will NEVER get tired of this place."}
{"text":"Sashimi Bowl with a side of rice. That's all I gotta say. 5 fresh fish options, with generous portions of each, with the pure \"hot stuff\" (fresh wasabi, not the green paste) on the side. Yum. The eel and mackeral (ordered separately) are good too. Oh, and did I mention they serve Orion? Sweet!  ****  I've been back a few times for HH too. It's a great option if you're craving sushi and want to watch your budget. Alot of the options are spicier than I like, though, but they have something for everyone, it seems. Can't go wrong with $1.50 Kirin draft."}
{"text":"Good sushi and the happy hour prices are fantastic. Try the saki sangria!"}
{"text":"My friends and I like coming here when we have big gatherings as this is a decently big place and the happy hour is always good.  All the sushi rolls are pretty good, but the items I always get are Mixed Tempura and the Spicy Tuna Roll.  I love the mixed tempura here because the breading is thin and the dipping sauce compliments the tempura so much.  The spicy tuna roll is also a better quality than most of the other places I've been because the quality is good, but they also give you alot of tuna.  Other rolls that are good are the dragon roll and the caterpillar.    The happy hour drinks are always good. I always like get the hot sake as it is very cheap and delicious to me.  Sake bombers are good too!"}
{"text":"Nowhere inspires my wrath more than Tempe Marketplace, except maybe a Super Walmart parking lot. But I think they're building one of those here, too. Add in a Babies 'R' Us and you'd hit the slit-my-wrists trifecta.  Kabuki would probably get three stars from me if it weren't located in the midst of this fakey-fake \"urban experience\" mall bullshit. But it is, so it doesn't.  Plus, they make their iced tea with tap water and it tastes like shit.   But coworkers looooove lunching at Tempe Marketplace. It's close to the office, and it's easy to drive and park there (never mind that we could walk to Mill Ave.) So OK, fine. I'm game, unless it's Maria Maria.  I've been here twice -- once for lunch and once for happy hour. Well, we tried to go for happy hour. It ends at 6:00. Fuck you, too, Kabuki. I work too late for that bullshit.   Next time I'll just go to Ra, where I might get severely injured eardrums from the ear-splitting club music bullshit. But at least they have cheap HH prices 'til 7:00. And they're on my drunk bus route home."}
{"text":"Pros:  -happy hour deals are pretty good -good variety of sushi and entree options for all types of eaters -to-go service has never disappointed (pick up is with the host so there is no need to navigate through the entire place to pick up) -if you like big cuts and large rolls, you will generally not be disappointed -a small portion of edamame is included for free to each table  Cons:  -the happy hour wait is long enough most nights to lead to unhappiness -every 4th time or so I leave with an upset stomach  Generally, I prefer to call ahead and place a to-go order for pick up and have never had to wait outside of the quoted time and have had better success with the freshness of my orders when eaten this way."}
{"text":"I just finished up appetizers and a drink with a friend. The theme so far in the East Valley is great service and mediocre food or terrible service and great food. I ordered a sushi roll and I wanted them to put mango slices on the side because I enjoy eating mango and scallops together. The chef told the server that if he put mango in the scallop roll then it was going to be awful and that if I didn't like it I could not return it. I had no intention of returning any food. So I asked if the Chef would just put the mango slices on the side and serve it as a side dish. The Chef told the server absolutely not that he would not do it even if I paid extra. So even though the service was wonderful I will not be returning to this restaurant over a few mango slices. Not to mention they no longer serve ahi tuna. Really?"}
{"text":"Moving from NYC - Tempe I thought my love for sushi would have to take a backseat. I ignorantly thought that there was no way sushi could be as good, or as fresh in the middle of the desert. Kabuki has proved me wrong time and time again! The fish is fresh, silky and buttery - as it should be. The poke bowl is my favorite! Pricing is amazing compared to NYC as well.  TL;DL I'm about it."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the sushi here. pricing is a little expensive, considering their are other places in the valley with similar quality for a bit cheaper. the happy hour menu is great though!  staff is always courteous and attentive. the ambience itself is a little too pretentious. the only thing missing is traditional east asia music playing while you eat."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Tempe, great japanese dishes as well. The prices are remarkably fare for the quality. They are also nearby so I don't have to drive far for good food. If you have a big party, or just a starving group, you HAVE to have the Love Boat! A wooden boat with everything great from the menu neatly and gratuitously piled on. (How do you say \"Bon Appetite\" in Japanese? Best I can manage is \"Allez cuisine\" from Iron Chef but ironically that is still French. LOL)  But let's face it, there are two things on the menu that keep my wife and I coming here: The Gold Rush Roll (tempura fried California Roll with Eel Sauce! -- You know, just take possibly the healthiest thing on the menu and DEEP FRY IT!) and the Tempura-fried Green Tea Ice Cream. (See a pattern here?)  It's all good and if you can catch a happy hour you will save even more cash. A word of warning though, this place is ALWAYS busy. Hmmmm... can't imagine why."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience!!! This was hands down the best sushi place we've ever been to Linde had the best customer service we've ever had please ask for her  she will blow you away, such a great personality and makes the environment so fun the manager Minh was awesome thanks kabuki !!!"}
{"text":"Lots to choose from and kudos for getting the Japanese dishes right!  Way better than the other sushi places, worth going a bit further for. Staff is attentive and efficient, makes for an all around good time!"}
{"text":"The location is great and there was no line which was a plus.   Presentation of food = GREAT Taste = Nothing that will keep me up at night Service = Lacking   The waitress and waiter did not have any idea what was in certain dishes. We ordered a pickled veggie appetizer and didn't know what one of the vegetables was, so we asked. Her response was \"that octopus\" which almost made my friend choke. Later we found out it was in fact a vegetable however this could give someone a panic attack, especially if they are allergic to certain seafoods.  Will I return = No thank you"}
{"text":"Love the service and the happy hour menu!!!! The sushi is absolutely delish."}
{"text":"Had the best early Mother's Day dinner here. The food was amazing and our server David was great. He was so nice and great at suggesting food and drink selections. The food did not take long at all to come out- and we ordered a lot of food. Everything about the overall experience here was amazing. Definitely will be coming here again. Great staff and great food. Thanks again David for the great service"}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant! We requested the bar area we were seated right away the service was fast and polite. The food was out of this world!  We ordered Dynamite roll, I can truly say I am addicted to it.  The Lotus Roll was very good!  The atmosphere was nice.  I would go back ASAP loved the place"}
{"text":"Place was extremely busy for a Saturday night. Was a bit of a let down as the sushi rolls were underwhelming. Redeeming factor was the poke bowls weren't too bad. It's a good place to hang with friends, specifically the patio on a beautiful day and have some Japanese beers to cool you down."}
{"text":"This place is such a great find! The happy hour prices are so cheap but it has the appearance of a super fancy restaurant and the taste of the sushi rolls were delicious! They definitely had the flavors of an awesome high end restaurant! The service was outstanding and we all really had a great time together here and have made this place a must go every time the family comes into town!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I went in for a quick lunch and was throughly pleased that with my sushi rolls did I also get a free appetizer. I chose the edamame and it did not disappoint. The rolls were delicious as well. I got one of their special rolls and one of their basic rolls. When I come across this restaurant again I'll definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"So I went there again (I was going to see Harry Potter okay!?) and the Yellowtail Sashimi was great as well as a simple, but tasty, Caterpillar Roll.  How can it be so awful one day, and decent the next?   Perhaps it's the people actually preparing the food! Taste what comes out of the kitchen if you own this place...fire the people who can't hack it.  Also, once again - The servers were dicks.  I notice MANY of the people that love this place are into the \"fried\" this and the \"tempura\" that, or worse yet...Teriyaki Chicken.   Word to the wise, if you want a Traditional Sushi experience i.e. - Raw Fish --- this might not be your best bet."}
{"text":"Kabuki's gave us a night to be remembered. We started by ordering from the appetizers and we couldn't stop. We ended up getting getting oysters, the half roasted king crab the half shell broiled mussels, miso soup and the house salad. Everything was very delicious and fresh. The service was excellent and our server made sure our cups were always full. We will be going back again!"}
{"text":"My experiences on three different occasions were all great!  Better to go during lunch time as they are usually slow.  Never had any issues with the wait staff.  I tried a table, but sitting at the sushi bar was much better.  Food is great, especially their hand made sushi speciality rolls.  The Spider Roll is my favorite.  As crazy as it sounds, I drank hot green tea because it just goes well with sushi instead of soda.  My co-worker got me hooked on this place during her last work visit to Scottsdale and I've always made it a point to eat here during my visits.  Can't wait to visit again (even in triple digit weather)!"}
{"text":"Overall Kabuki is a pretty good sushi restaurant located smack dab in the middle of town square. They have an interesting array of rolls and uniforms alike!  Personally I enjoy the atmosphere and the wait staff more then I do the food which is a rarity for me. (Did that come out right? Oh well.... ) Anyway, that is not to say the food sucks, it's actually pretty good but just well overpriced. Actually more of Town Square priced is the best way to put it.   Check it out during happy hour as they run some pretty good specials."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location, has a great vibe, and our server was very nice. The edamame, gyoza, and sushi rolls were very average. The chicken teriyaki bowl was bland, which I didn't even know was possible. Though it wasn't a bad experience overall, the quality of the food was disappointing. We will stick to Sekai Sushi from now on."}
{"text":"***No longer Celiac/gluten intolerant Friendly*** I am done with this restaurant. I used to be able to rely on this place, to be one of the few places my whole family could eat at happily. Having Celiacs disease is hard enough. We used to be able to come here and all be happy with our meals. Until our most recent visit. We walked in and were informed that they threw out all their gluten free menus. Are you kidding? So what is the server just supposed to tell me everything that CAN be done gluten free? How am I now supposed to know what I can eat? Coming in and expecting my Celiacs to not weigh me down here, expecting a nice meal and boom, nope. I was looking at the gf menu they still have on their website. And told our server what I wanted, only to be told things were discontinued. So my family and I try to find a few things I can have, calling out items, only for our waiter to tell us \"no that has gluten in it. No that also has gluten in it.\" Are you kidding me!  Our poor server, was so awesome though. He even said he disagreed with the decision to get rid of the gf menu, because with it things were much easier and better. He was sincerely trying to help me find something I could eat. He went and searched high and low for a gf menu. He found ONE crumpled and bent. Brought it to me. But it was just the same out dated one on their website so it didn't help much.  The one sushi roll I was able to order, while tasted great, the pieces were cut so largely that when I ate them they hit my gag reflex in the back of my throat. So I couldn't even eat all of that. Over all this experience was extremely upsetting and stressful...and I don't plan to ever be coming back. I understand restaurants can't legally call things \"gluten free\" due to being a place that also serves gluten items and possible cross contamination. But that's common sense, any person with Celiacs understands. Though once you eliminated any kind of \"gluten sensitive\" menu, it was like you said you stopped caring about my needs."}
{"text":"Amazing menu with great prices. Very nice place and the happy hour will be worthwhile! I enjoyed the ramen chicken soup and the Apple crump cake with green tea ice cream. The asparagus and salmon sushi roll was also great."}
{"text":"My mom had $15 off for her birthday month, so we decided to dine here for lunch ~  Service: 5/5 The hostess and waitress were super friendly and attentive.  Price: 4/5 Lunch specials were all reasonably priced, all $10 - $15.  Kabuki Deluxe: 3.5/5 The Kabuki Deluxe ($13.95) was a super generous portion, with a little bit of everything. The chicken and beef were dry. Everything else was just okay.  Sushi Moriawase: 3.5/5 The Sushi Moriawase ($13.95) looks deceivingly small, but I left full just the same. The fish was dry, but otherwise everything else was okay.  Soft shell crab: 3/5 Super cute presentation. A single soft shell crab on a bed of grilled onions (like half an onion). It wasn't very good though. Eating this cute little soft shell crab was like putting a spoonful of peanut butter in your mouth -- coats your entire mouth with a single flavor (aka onion) and leaves your mouth feeling dry. I've had better at AYCE.   Also, our food didn't come out at the same time, which isn't that big of a deal, but isn't preferred, nam sayin'?   Overall: 3.5/5 I don't know how they managed to coordinate the chicken, beef, raw fish, and fried crab to be dry that day I came, but consider me impressed. The rest of the food was okay, while the service and lunch special prices redeem this place. I don't think this place is bad, I just think it's better when I'm not paying full price."}
{"text":"Come in at 2.30 so it was deserted. Thou our waiter was nice. Food is still pretty fresh. Good eat."}
{"text":"Wow - what a terrific experience. Laid-back Sunday afternoon and we couldn't have asked for a better lunch. Great service, very friendly and helpful. Delicious food - the sushi was fresh and flavorful, the miso soup was the best I've ever had. Comforting! Oh, and the sake bombs were spectacular. I will definitely return here again and again. Thanks for a beautiful lunch."}
{"text":"Kabuki is a good restaurant in the area. This is usually a place we end up at spur of the moment, either on our way to the movies or taking a break from shopping. I really enjoy the poke tuna and the lotus on fire roll, the sashimi is always really good as well!"}
{"text":"Kabuki has decent food. Nothing worth driving across the city for, but we were in the area after going to the movies and I'm a member of the Red Mask club and I had a $15 credit for my birthday so we had dinner here tonight. Nothing exceptional except the speed of the sushi chefs. We were seated at the sushi bar because we were told there was a wait for tables (even though there were several open in the same area as the sushi bar, I guess they were claimed already). It took an exceptionally long time for our server to come back after delivering our drinks so that my dinner partner could order off the menu instead of directly from the sushi chefs, in the meantime my two rolls were already sitting in front of me. It was nice that the sushi was ready so fast but I still waited for my dinner partner to get his food so they sat untouched for quite some time. The food was good, and I'd come here again, but the overall service was slow and seemed uncoordinated.  Eventually we finished all of our food and drink and had to flag down the waiter to ask for the check, even though he had just been by to run our neighbors' check. Seemed somewhat inexperienced but weren't in a hurry so we still left a decent tip. OK food if you're in the area but nothing special."}
{"text":"Supposedly this restuarant is another transplant of a popular place from CA. And I can see why it's so popular :)   The service was friendly and efficient. The space is clean and nice. The sushi/sashimi, while not the best I've ever had, is decent and fresh. They have a very extensive menu and some interesting options too. Rolls are tasty :)  Also, they gave us free birthday ice cream! Score!  Oh, and you gotta get the garlic edamame!!!! It's addictingly delicious..."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. I appreciate that the managers took the time to reach out to me about my dining experience and fix what happened. I am happy that multiple levels of managers worked together to assess and rectify my situation. Happy to see that the restaurant cares about their customer's dining experience and will continually work to improve their processes and training for their employees."}
{"text":"Great location! Nice interior and exterior decorations. Reverse Happy Hour.  That pretty much covers the major highlights of Kabuki Japanese restaurant. The food served is okay to good, price is average, service is prompt and pleasant.  And even for weekday lunches, the place is still pretty busy (the restaurant has roughly 50% of their tables occupied). The fact that it is located conveniently near the Rave Motion Pictures, a plethora of shopping and other restaurants and bars undoubtedly contributed to the ongoing success of this national restaurant outpost.  If you are in the vicinity of Town Square and in the mood for some Japanese food before resuming your hunt for that perfect little black dress or that movie to start, I would totally recommend Kabuki.  Especially from 3-6pm on Monday to Friday (their regular happy hour), or their lunch hour (11am to 4pm daily).  Kabuki is also a great place to grab a bite before spending the rest of the evening getting your beer goggles on.  The reverse HH from 9pm until close (Monday-Thursday) and 8pm until close on Sundays makes Kabuki a happy place to start the evening.  The B.B.Q. Beef Ribs (Kalbi) is excellent here. Even though the portion is not particularly generous, the flavor and how it is grilled perfectly makes up for that. Many of the sauces that accompanies the appetizers and entrees are tasty and compliments the overall dish.  The only item I would avoid is the tempura, as it looks like it was overfried and on the greasy side.  Location:  5/5 Love it!  If you regularly hang out in the southern portion of Las Vegas, this will be a convenient location for you.  It is not too far from Mandalay Bay, so if you are visiting Las Vegas and on that end of the Strip, it will not be too far to travel via a cab.  Service:  4/5  Prompt service, friendly staff.  Ambiance:  4/5  The bar area looks nice, the rest of the restaurant has a coherent theme to the design and decor.  Price:  3/5  Average for non-AYCE Japanese restaurants.  Food:  3.5/5  Tasty, but otherwise average for Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to Kabuki several times but this time I wasn't amazed with the food. Their sushi was bland, there wasn't anything extraordinary about it. I'm not the best cook but if I were to attempt to make sushi, it would taste like this and the result wouldn't be so good. It's tasted like they rushed in making the food that they forgot how to make it taste good. However, our Server, David did a great job in checking up on our table to see if we needed anything. Thank you David!."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with Kabuki, their appetizer dishes and rolls were not what I thought they would be, and not only that, I found a hair in one of my rolls! Needless to say, I sent back the rolls, and asked for the cheque. I did not want to make a fuss so I paid for what we ate, minus the rolls and left.   Will not be returning, as even without the hair incident, the place wasnt a standout."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times always for happy hour.  I love this place and would go here anytime.  The wait staff is always attentive and very nice.  We always get way to much food.  The beer prices and saki prices for happy hour are hard to beat.  I honestly can't remember what I ate here but I've never been disappointed with any of it.  They have some kind of spicy ahi cakes that you spread onto fried wonton skins that we get every time.  Good price, nice portions.  I like this spot and will return regularly."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant is EXCELLENT in terms of foods, service and the ambiance too. I love the location, the interior design, and the cheerfulness and hospitality of the servers. Huy is an amazing Manager who always watch on everyone's needs and make sure they are all attended and were given excellent service and satisfaction. Susana has been our most favorite server ever since, but when she's not around, there's always someone nice that would serve us.  Keep doing a great job! This has been my husband and I's favorite restaurant! Westgate is a little far from our house, but since we love this place so much, we don't mind driving. It's always been satisfactory! They don't fail to satisfy us!  Normally it's just the two of us that comes here, but during school break, hubby's daughter is with us..and she loves this place too! We have brought a lot of friends here already. Because we love introducing our favorite places to dine, and this is our top#1? So for those that haven't tried this place. Please do give it a try! It's worth it! So highly recommended  Keep up the excellent job guys!!! See you later"}
{"text":"The last time I was here, one of my very good friends wasn't yet with child. Since then, she gave birth to a beautiful little girl (whom I shall likely see this weekend). During that visit, I had the company of friends and that lended itself favorably to enjoying that experience. Tonight, with another group of good friends, I rekindled the love affair that is Kabuki.   First, I must say that Tempe Marketplace is an amazing venue and, in and of itself, deserves respect for culminating such an amazing atmosphere. Kabuki fits in swimmingly with this notion. Impressive service, high-quality sushi and a stellar happy hour make this a very coveted destination. I look forward to returning, even if it's off the light rail path.   Ask Casey what he did to his fingers."}
{"text":"I had an amazing Ninja Deluxe for Lunch. Perfect variations of food on one plate. There is everything for any kind of people from Salad to Sushi and Meat... what do you want more. The price is ok about $12. Always happy with the food. No complains. People are nice and friendly. Great service. Would totally recommend this place. Love it! Perfect location at Tivoli Village."}
{"text":"First time visit and will not be my last. After Kabuki was closed at Tivoli Village, I made a visit to the one and only Kabuki here in Las Vegas. Today I matched my Ninja Deluxe lunch with a delicious Dragon Roll and you shall never forget to drink something with your food, my choice was a Mai Tai. Location is good, inside and outside seating area. Clean restaurant and friendly service. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour. They have a diverse selection on their happy hour menu, and many items without rice as I tend to avoid it. I have never had anything bad there. Their spicy tuna salad is my favorite. My only complaint the snotty Summerlin crowd that tends to frequent that place, and the old men who save seats at the bar with no guests to ever appear."}
{"text":"Went out to go shopping and stumbled across this little gem . Food was fantastic and service was exceptional!! The server was friendly and always made sure our glasses we filled and after we finished our dish she was quick to clear the plates promptly. We ordered the dish that you need two or more to order and it was so much food me and my husband could hardly finish !!! If your hungry and want good Japanese food the a is the place to go! Also prices are reasonably low considering the quality of food you get and not to mention it's right off the strip!"}
{"text":"Awesome higher-ish-end sushi place. Great staff, good sushi. A bit pricier, but I feel like you get your money's worth. They do have a wonderful variety of sushi and non-sushi, so plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here after my daughter's graduation from ASU about 11am. Our party of 5 was seated after a brief wait and placed our individual orders. Only a handful of customers. Our meals came with a snoozer salad. I ordered the tempura shrimp and veggies. Mine came 10 min. after everyone's orders were served. Thinking the tempura was going to be hot and crispy after the wait and was thoroughly disappointed. One look at my meal caused me to laugh in despair. 2 finger length green beans, 2 half dollar sized yellow squash, 2 green squash sliced so thick they were raw, and 3 small shrimp. All Luke warm and not crispy at all! (Soggy) looked like an appetizer. $10.99 mind you. Came with a dipping sauce that tasted like watered down soy sauce. Asked for wasabi and pickled ginger on the side. 1/4 teaspoon of each, size of a dime. Server was never to be found and never refreshed our drinks. Can you believe she was training somebody as well? Ha ha!!! My wife and I's bill came to $25. Nobody was really happy with their meal either. I was still hungry so I sampled my daughter's chicken. Half dollar sized medallion of white meat chicken. Dry, dry dry....no flavor even soaking in the soy sauce water the call broth in her bowl and I soaked it in wasabi and soy sauce. This place sucks big time! What a shame. The Pro's..parking. I was screwed by the other location too so I guess it was my stupidity for coming back. Please don't waste your hard earned money here. Not even close to authentic Japanese food! You have been warned so take heed my friends."}
{"text":"Went here about 1pm on Sunday not very crowded and seated immediately. Menus and drinks followed. Service remained good throughout our visit. That's where the good stopped. The food?....well, let me just say this; \"Don't waste your money!\" Quality and quantity suffers greatly here. Nothing remotely Japanese at Kabuki only the name! Still hungry when we left and $35 lighter. No drink order either. The cooks here need to go to Japan to see how Japanese food is really crafted! I dislike having that feeling I just got ripped off. Dam!!!"}
{"text":"Sure it's a Friday night and they are busy however it is not an excuse to bring the sushi 35 min after the order.... Wrong sushi! We had to ask 3 times for the drink we ordered and finally we canceled it."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour for cheap, decent sushi.  I got salmon nigiri and a spicy tuna crunch roll for around $10!"}
{"text":"Decided to hang out here during pro bowl since last minute ticket scalping is too much like gambling for my taste. .. We grabbed the cozy bench seating right behind the hostess area and had to get up to order from the bartender, she made great drinks and the food came out super quick & tasty. The softshell crab, shrimp tempura and eel rolls were all great, very pleased with the calamari as well ;) oh, btw you get free edamame too!"}
{"text":"Great food & Great service! Hong was our waitress & she was awesome. This place has lots of flavor, lots of fun dishes to try & the food & drinks are really good.Very busy spot,make a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Unagi bowl. It is a rice bowl with freshwater eel smothered in sauce and decorated with sliced avocados and egg scramble slices. This was a very filling dish. I was already full and I was not done with it yet! The eel is very soft with I like. It has a very fatty texture and that is the best part. I definitely will be coming back here for the Unagi bowl in the future. My dish came out to be $14.02 with tax. I love how they have a lot of things on their menu, it gives you a lot of choices to pick from."}
{"text":"best Kabuki I've ever been to.  service at the bar was awesome.  between Liam, Joe, and Linda everything was great.  they knew my order after the second time being there.  super friendly and attentive, and the food and drinks were great.  if you get a chance, I highly recommend going here.  Randy"}
{"text":"To get a 5 something really has to rock, sorry. It didn't rock. It was pretty good, but it didn't rock. Got several different sorts of sushi with a large group and most were pretty good, especially the spicy ones. Also got the garlic edamame, which was pretty good, too. It is a good location, too. You know, as I right this I realize nothing stood out for me here. A-OK."}
{"text":"Their menus have improved tremulously since my last review. They added much more varieties on choices and even include lots of colorful photos for customer to choose from. However, the service has definitely gone down hill. I was here with a friend last night and the waiter was a bit short with us. The only time we would get any attention was by waiving him down ourselves. Our experience may have been differ if we don't come here on a busy weekend. Hostesses were friendly though.   We ordered a spicy tuna roll and it was just ok. Garlic Edamame was delicious and the cucumber eel roll was average. Overall, I'm not impressed. I did, however, enjoy the mojito with cherry flavor. I will order that again."}
{"text":"Went there last time to try their happy hour and got 3 rolls. They were good however flavors were lacking. Maybe because of the nice place I was expecting more out of it but it didn't happen, at least this time. I'll give them another shot and see if I change my rating  but so far I guess I'm being fair.  Staff was nice and found me a table in no time. Waiter was quick and I got proper refills. I was pleased to see their patio for when it's not Summer outside."}
{"text":"Love the food in this place. Service not the best, but I still give the food quality a decent eating. I believe we waited longer than most to get our food and our server's attention- this is more of a training issue for them, I would surmise."}
{"text":"Maybe i just got unlucky, but my stomach has been unhappy since I had lunch here (and my roommate didn't fare so well either).  We had the happy boat (oh the irony!) which was ok, nothing special. The chicken teriyaki in it was pretty weird, we couldn't pinpoint what it was, but there was definitely something off about it.  Service was very friendly, though they didn't ever check on us. The place is nice, and the food tasted fine, but it's a little expensive for lunch and.. i cannot deny an angry tummy"}
{"text":"Kabuki wont deliver cutting edge delights like that basement gem in Boston or Seattle, so dont get your hopes up.  But if you're like me, thrilled to dip a few standard rolls in too much soy without getting sick in the shadow of the stadium, Kabuki's a kickass spot for the family to enjoy that second rate sushi experience.   We've had two decent meals here. One in a hurry before a game and the second a more leisurely affair out on their porch overlooking the outdoor mall. Both servers were young and tentative, but polite and pleasant and accomodated our plans well each time. The sushi is very ordinary.  Tempura's better.    On a generic Quality/Price scale, it's too expensive, but you're also paying for a special location, steps from the stadium and parking. The premium they charge for that, compared to other pregame alternatives, seems like a very fair exchange."}
{"text":"Sorely disappointed. I've eaten at some of the top sushi restaurants in all of North America and have not ever been refused a straight walk to an empty sushi bar, until today. Two gals at the hostess bar were too enthralled with taking a phone- in order! So.... we walked away! Customer service is number 1 with me... and first impressions! No second chances on this one!"}
