{"text":"Me and my 5 year old son stopped at this place for lunch. First time we have ever been there. I walk in immediately start looking at the menu on the wall. Young lady asked me what I liked was very helpful. I brought two corn beef sandwiches. I noticed that they had chairs where you can sit down, so me and my son sat down and waited on our food. When we received the food I figured hey let's just stay here and eat. I started to pull my food out to give my son his sandwich and a rude Nigerian or Jamaican guy! So not politely told me how there's a sign by the door stating if its pick up you must leave. Then after embarrassing me in front of the entire restaurant he proceeded to yell out to a crew member put a bigger sign up.  I'm pretty shocked at the way the customer service in this restaurant. Most restaurants would have let something as simple as me deciding to change my mind from pick up to dine in GO. Especially when I spent about $20 on two sandwiches. pretty sure I won't ever go back there again. Besides they gave me a cold cornbeef sandwich. The Swiss cheese was not even melted, and the worst part about it all they don't put mustard on the sandwich. It could have been handled better. At least offer me the option to pay the Dollar to dine instead of just throwing me out."}
{"text":"Last two times I've come here, the corned beef was dry and just not good. What happened?"}
{"text":"Gave this place one star because I couldn't go any lower. I've been looking for a Corned beef place for some time now and decided to try this place out. Bad decision on my part. Placed an order for a Corned beef sandwich and a Corned beef omelet. Got my sandwich and 15 min later was still waiting for the omelet. I attempted to get my money back and waited another 15 min because the only person that could return the money was the 'chef'. He proceeded with an attitude to give our food away to other folks. Everyone working there had no hair nets while working directly over food and no one cleaned the counter once while we were there. If you want good service, cleanliness and space to eat this isn't the place to go to."}
{"text":"Not a Bad sandwich. But good old Eastside rudeness. First rudely told that I am standing in the wrong place.  So I move and say I am sorry then  order.  There are 2 stools marked take out only so I sit down.  I am Handicapped and use a cane.  I wait and after a while she tells (rudely)me my sandwich is over there where you pick up.  I tell her thanks for letting me know it was ready. She walks away mumbling under her breath.  Customer service SUCKS BAD.  I can only imagine what eating in must be like. The sandwich was good .  She ripped the bottom slice of bread, so instead of putting a new one on she just doubled it up. Stick to takeout.  But make sure you stand in the right place at the right time."}
{"text":"Had a great corned beef sandwich and an equally good bowl of cabbage soup in this true slice of Cleveland diner. Sit at the counter and watch the hard working crew cook on the flat top griddle located no more than four feet from your seat. Enjoy the other customers and characters that frequent the joint as the gruff but pleasant waitress yells out food orders to the cooks who yell back at her. Probably not a good spot for hipsters,  former yuppies and pretentious food snobs."}
{"text":"Good comfort food for breakfast, lunch & early dinner at great prices. The generous corned beef sandwich is, I am told by the friendly, efficient counter staff, the most popular item on the menu.. Along with the exceptionally high corned beef sandwiches are some tastie sides like onion rings,french fries, potatoe salad, coleslaw,..."}
{"text":"rude staff and a mostly fat corned beef. Save your money Goodmans was way better!"}
{"text":"They managed to put on gloves for everything but that doesn't help when the place is a mess. There's a smell permeating throughout the place. I see a lot of employees but no cleaning. Fry oil is old, there was a burnt piece of what I think was meatloaf on the grill. Needs work."}
{"text":"I love the old school diner feel of this place.  Corned beef is delicious, but so is everything else.  Friendly staff, pro chefs who know how to make this food well.  Highly recommended.  It's not a posh place, but I'm not a posh person, I just like a good burger, corned beef or philly sandwich.  Fries, with cheese could be a meal!"}
{"text":"I came for breakfast. Second time I've tried this place. Standard diner fare. Had a veggie omelet and home fries. Pretty bland. Medium to smallish (and inconsistant) portion sizes. Mediocre service. Terrible coffee. Asked twice for a glass of water and it never came. The place isn't particularly clean either. There are just much better places for breakfast around here.  *UPDATE! - It's approximately 4 hours after I ate breakfast there, and after 45 minutes of writhing around feeling like I'm being stabbed in the belly repeatedly, I have turned into a rocket. A foul, awful rocket. I feel fortunate that my phone is fully charged, as I may be here a while. One star, because I can't give zero, and I wouldn't eat here again for free. RUN!"}
{"text":"They offer gigantic portions. Their breakfast is on point too. It's a small deli/diner with limited seating. Also, keep in mind this isn't the type of place you will go to take your guests from out of town. It's a deli that serves cheap breakfast and corn beef sandwiches, nothing more. You can watch them as they make your food, which I always like to observe.  I order their corn beef all the time. They're similar to Slyman's but their prices are a little bit cheaper, especially their items that are not corn beef.    I would suggest you call in your order. Also, double check with them that they took down your order. They mix up orders a lot, and they can have you waiting for at least 15 min, even though you called ahead. So take note. But overall it's a decent place, and I would go back there."}
{"text":"Dirty, sloppy and did I mention dirty? The food is cheap and low quality. You sit on a stool at the bar and see just how filthy everything is, from the toaster, to the floors and sticky counters. If you do eat here, don't expect much. This place is o"}
{"text":"Every time I go into this place to get a pound or two of corned beef it takes forever. Today I needed 3 lb for a dinner we are having, attempted to call ahead. Got passed to 3 people before the last (rude) lady told me I have to order 4 lb or more for call ahead (the guy before told me 4 sandwiches or more, not 3 lb.). I'm making the trek downtown now even though it's totally out of my way. I'm not going to go spend 40 dollars in a place that is going to make me wait 30 minutes to cut my beef and it's not even that good."}
{"text":"This diner features a large selection of hot deli sandwiches, in addition to breakfast and simple dinner entrees.  For our visit, we decided to order two of their eponymous corned beef Reuben sandwiches to-go.   Railroad diner cars were historically narrow, and the Cleveland Corned Beef Co. replicates that distinction to a fault.  Bar seating along the counter grill line, and you'll have to walk single-file, please, to the rear of the place if you desire to dine in one of the two tiny booths.  The sandwiches were excellent, with tender, flavorful beef; hot, gooey swiss cheese and mildly sweet sauerkraut stuffed between not-too-thin slices of crispy rye bread. The fries were most-likely of the prepared, frozen variety, yet they were hot and crispy...and made from unpeeled potatoes, which we prefer.  For decent sandwiches and  serviceable diner grub, this skinny spot is hard to beat...but if you are the least bit claustrophobic, you might want to consider take-out."}
{"text":"Not sure about all the hate with these reviewers... This is definitely not Goodman's, but it stands well on its own.  Corned beef was tender and good flavored. More of a fatty cut, but I would prefer it to lean towards the fattier end of the spectrum anyways. Too lean usually indicates less flavor.  My friend had the pastrami. Meh. I thought it was ok.  We both ordered onion rings. Decent.  The waitress was very nice, and quick. All of the staff seemed friendly.  So...not Goodman's,  but in some ways that was a plus. The old Goodman's had GREAT corned beef. But holy hell, the place was filthy. And what was up with all those gross, dusty Colonial Club liquor bottles??  This place was clean. Very clean. I was looking for dust or grease. None found.  Found out this is owned by Marc Glassman (of Marc's stores). Now it all makes sense.   I'll come back and try more of the menu. Got a matzoh ball soup to go. Looked yummy. I'll let you know.   Is this the BEST corned beef I've ever had? Probably not, but I really enjoyed my sandwich. I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Best corned beef on the west side. I eat there all the time. I ate there for years when it was Goodmans and the corned beef hasn't changed. It was excellent then and now too. One plus now is they've expanded their menu. Everyone I've spoken to while I've been there says everything is good. I stick to the corned beef."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible !! It is disgusting, dirty and terrible service ! I have never been talked to with such disrespect in my life, literally yelling at us to stand behind the take out sign, when we were trying to but the place is so small that it was hard to all fit behind the sign .. they also talked to each other with complete disrespect ... Getting into fights in front of the customers ... so unprofessional , I will never go back there again I don't even understand how they are still in business with the way that place is ran"}
{"text":"I dont understand some of the reviews on here. This is a great place to grab a quick bite. I actually think there Corned Beef is OK, but I think there are other things that shine on their menu. They have an awesome pastrami sandwich and their soups are amazing! Their Motzo Ball Soup is a meal itself. You can't go wrong with their burgers and their melts.  Their polish boys are great too. I'm not a connoisseur of Corned Beef, but I have been to Jewish Deli's in NYC, Washington, and San Francisco and to me Corned Beef is Corned Beef, it all tastes the same, its just what you do with it that makes the sandwich special."}
{"text":"Nostalgia will only get you so far.  I ordered the perch dinner and my friend ordered the shrimp basket.  I know this is a corn beef place but I wasn't in the mood.  I watched the cook pull a bucket out of the fridge containing a milky liquid and raw fish fillets.  He tossed the fillets in what appeared to be white flour.  Dropped them in the grease and walked way.  A few minutes later a waitress dropped 2 bags of frozen shrimp on top of that.  The grease cooled and my fish simmered in a frothy goo.  When we were served my friend asked for cocktail sauce. After several minutes of stalling and acting busy, the waitress admitted, they didn't have any.  The fries were cold, the slaw WAS GOOD.   My fish tasted spoiled... I did not eat it and I didn't eat the cold fries.  The waitress took my 5 dollar tip and never asked why I didn't eat.  And I'm a fat guy!  I obviously love to eat!!  I def will not go back.  It's a real shame too!  I hear goodmans was awesome!  This place will be out of business soon.  Just wait and see."}
{"text":"Cleveland Corner Beef is one of those railcar diners that you might find along Route 66 back in the day, only it's not in a railcar, it's in a shopping center on Pearl Road and Brookpark Road.   This is one of those places that serves you about 1.5 lbs of meat between two slices of butter-grilled white bread, with a pickle spear and frozen French fries. And it's good; that is if you want 1.5 meat between two slices of butter-grilled white bread, with a pickle spear and frozen French fries.   I mean, look, let's not try to make this place anything more than it is. It's a dive deli in Parma/Brooklyn. It's clean, but not CLEAN. The staff are friendly, but not FRIENDLY, and the food is good, not GREAT.   Will I stop in every now and again for lunch if I'm nearby? Sure! Will I take an out of towner there sometime to show them that New York or Chicago isn't the only place you can get an overstuffed deli sandwich? Absolutely! Will I add this to my regular rotation of restaurants? Probably not. You get the idea..."}
{"text":"Place is dirty and corned beef is dry.  French fries were good but ketchup bottle has tomato paste in it instead of ketchup.  The location was Goodman's years ago.  Goodman's was great.  This is awful."}
{"text":"I'll first start with this: if you're expecting the corned beef sandwich you got at Goodman's (which was this exact place) you'll be disappointed. Very disappointed. If you're expecting the quality you got at Cork and Lennys on the Eastside, you'll be marginally disappointed. I was never a huge fan of C&L to begin with but was hoping that they may have just taken over Goodman's and kept it rocking. I was wrong and it may be wrong to have those expectations, but it is what it is.   I had to take a chance to find out, but now that I know I'll never be back. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful, but there are better corned beef places in Cleveland. Slyman's, Tals and Danny's Deli are what I'll stick to."}
{"text":"It's a greasy spoon and there is nothing wrong with that. I really like the affordable breakfast. The everything omelet rocks and is enormous!!!"}
{"text":"Place was empty. Place was dirty. Employees standing around instead of cleaning off the flat top or prep areas. Grabbed two sandwiches to go and won't be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pastrami and corned beef combo with horseradish and mustard on rye.  Pretty sure you have to ask for that, as it is not on the menu.  You cannot go wrong here with this combo and it is worth it. I will return when in this area."}
{"text":"WOW & YES! All the good words...... The corned beef hash is TO DIE FOR.... also I live for their polish boy ( poor boy ) amazing & authentic.  I have been going  there & getting 'to go ' steadily for years now. Quality is always the same.  Outstanding for the  cheap price."}
{"text":"Love the old lunch counter feel and friendly staff who were attentive and quick behind the counter. I found the place to have a nostalgic feel and it was clean. Food was good. Was it the best corned beef I've had in Cleveland? No, but that corned beef sandwich was enjoyed. And the dollar fries were crispy delicious fresh cut. Unlimited Horsradish and thousand island at the place settings a plus. Only complaint is they didn't appear to have a public bathroom?"}
{"text":"Awesome corned beef with large portions.  Always good for a lunch run.  It's a small diner with a lunch counter style.  Expect to be crowed in a small space during busy times, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great corned beef and pleasant staff....the peach for dessert was tops....will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The service can be a little slow when it's busy but it's well worth the wait. The server had a smile on her face and the staff is social. My meal was large for the price ( I got the steak and eggs) and was cooked perfectly. I am definitely coming back here soon."}
{"text":"This review is ONLY for their corned beef.   All sales from today were going to the fund for the three young women and child found recently, so that's very much to their credit; a very cool thing to do.   However. This is a food review, and after trying their corned beef for the 2nd time there's no doubt in mind that 1) they really are clueless about how to cook corned beef and 2) see #1.   Look, while I didn't expect corned beef similar to that from Corky & Lenny's or Mr Brisket, if you're charging TEN FIFTY for a corned beef sandwich (which, I think, is what C&L's charges for their big one), then it had damned well better be at least somewhat in the same ballpark. Not only was it NOT in the same ballpark, I'm pretty sure it wasn't even in the same national park. Or the same state. Or continent. Or galaxy.   The Cleveland Corned Beef restaurant may do many things well but corned beef isn't one of them. This is the 2nd time  on Yelp I've had to majorly ding corned beef which came from restaurants with CORNED BEEF IN THEIR NAME. What's wrong with this picture?   Yes, I know it's the West Side and, legally, good corned beef is not allowed east of the Cuyahoga, but, still, can't somebody at least get to \"hey, not bad,\" as opposed to \"hey, I'm gonna barf?\"   Apparently not."}
{"text":"Used to get the best corned beef when it was Goodman's! The last 2 times have had rude and awful service! This last time it took forever for them to remember to make our reubens and I am sorry but at $10 a piece there is no excuse for them all to be burnt and no 1000 island dressing! So if anyone know of a place to get an good reuben let me know! I could almost have handled the rude service but burnt food is just too much!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was my first time here but my family comes here each year after visiting West Park. Having corned beef sandwiches and matzo ball soup has become sort of a family tradition.  The place is located in a strip mall, and could easily be missed. The place is long and narrow, with a counter running down the center from the cashier to the back, where there are some booths. It's a little divey, but that's okay! I believe the owner is also the cook (an excellent cook by the way).  We sat at the counter, and got a number of items. I got a matzo ball soup (very good), and a patty melt. My aunt got a corned beef sandwich, and also an order of corned beef hash, which is made fresh. The hash was amazing! The portion sizes are huge, and the prices are good.  I came back a couple of months later, and got matzo ball soups and corned beef sandwiches to go for my family back in Columbus. My aunt and I were raving about this place, so they wanted to check it out. On my second trip here, I went straight for the corned beef hash :-)"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been wanting to try the Cleveland Corned Beef sandwich shop since it transformed from Goodman's Sandwich Inn.  It no longer has the same menu or the same staff, but it has the same diner ambiance.  I tried the Rueuben and my wife ordered a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  My reuben was delicious.  It was piled high with corned beef and the bread was yummy too.  The thousand island dressing on the side was tasty as well.  I would recommend this corned beef sandwich to anyone.  Is it the same as Goodman's?  No.  Is the beef cut by the same guy in the front window?   No.  There are more people working here than when it was Slyman's, but in my opinion, it is just as good.  We waited 10 minutes for our two sandwiches and they were pretty busy.  No issues there.  I'll try it again, but until then, I'll be wondering why this place isn't pulling better reviews.    Recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here half a dozen times, and other than the staff being crabby a few times, this place makes my favorite corned beef sandwich, and leave nothing out. I wish I would of tried goodman's inn, but I missed that boat!  They also make a nice philly steak."}
{"text":"Walked in. Not greeted and stood there for take out. Nothing. No hello. The staff just stood around talking. Place didn't look clean. Walked out."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place ,for the first time, after frequenting a store in the plaza and realized it was lunch time so the wife and I thought about a corned beef sandwich . Upon entering the congested quarters with no seating availability, we decided on take out. After being asked nicely at first about what we wanted we said we were looking, quickly the corned beef idea went out the window as the corned beef on the slicer looked gross and another customer had one that was close to where  we were standing. For almost $13 dollars a sandwich , small portion and gross looking meat. We decided on a Philly Cheesesteak and a Chicken Philly with fries. So agreeing with the other reviews the employee that took our order now became very rude and unprofessional by twice sternly telling us that we were standing in the way and we need \"to follow the signs\" WTF? Then it started getting a constant wave of customers and the other employees started getting edgy. We then waited about 20 minutes and three or four customers who ordered after us got their sandwiches ahead of us! During this time , I had the chance to observe the surroundings which were very unsanitary and filthy and I'm quite sure the inspectors haven't been around this place in a long time! This was a shame cause the sandwiches and fries along with a delicious pickle couldn't even bring us back here! Not recommended!"}
{"text":"Why have a place if this is how you are going to run it? DIRTY, slow and out of Coffee at 9:30am on a Saturday.  Waitress served up one cup, when asked for a second she said, she was out of coffee. The cook told her to go in back and that she had to \"look\" for it.  She reluctantly went to look for it.  We also noticed that with only 4 people in front of us, the food was very slow to be served. We waited while the waitress looked for coffee....we decide this was just not going to be a good experience and left. There was absolutely no reason for the slow service and no excuse for being out of coffee.  This is owned by Mr Glassman (of MARCS) and the service and cleanliness reminds me of many of the stores. Will never return."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Had the corned beef hash and eggs. Although the portion was large the corned beef was dry as a bone. Had better out of a can. The place looks like it could use a thorough cleaning from top to bottom. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I was excited to try this two-butt bar seating/some booths in back dive. Didn't have to wait too long for breakfast and sat right in front of the flat-top. Looking over the simple menu, breakfast until 11:30 sharp by the way, there were some great comfort dish choices. Biscuits and gravy, corned beef hash and eggs, pancakes, french toast, two egg breakfast and a breakfast egg sandwich. I chose the corned beef hash because hey, its called Cleveland Corned Beef! After several cups of coffee, we were served a decent sized meal, but the hash was a little over done. I was disappointed that the pieces of potato and corned beef were shaved so small, that after cooking, they shrunk up into little crispy pieces. I'm a big fan of hash, but when its hearty, chunky and flavorful. This had zero flavor, so I had to mash my over easy eggs all over the hash.   I should have chose the pancakes."}
{"text":"Great old school diner/ deli. It is what it is. No frills, busy, tight quarters.  Ordered the Corned Beef, perfect. Fries were also good. Hot, crispy etc... Not sure of the bad reviews, but I come back as well as recommend CCB as well. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I agree with the comment on fattier cut of corned beef, but it was flavorful. Generous portions for sure! I had the half soup and sandwich lunch combo for $6-7. They gave me a full sandwich, it seemed like, and a full pint container of soup. Chicken noodle was good. The brocolli and cheddar soup was just ok. For the price, I would recommend this place."}
