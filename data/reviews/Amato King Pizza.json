{"text":"Super slow delivery -- ordered at 6:30pm, arrived at the door just after 9:30pm after calling the store two times. When the pizzas arrived, the delivery guy asked us to check if he brought the right pizzas; we checked hastily and quoted them by name. He quickly confirmed them when we mentioned what we had asked for and hurried off. When we sat down, we weren't surprised we had totally different pizzas.

This is the second time we've ordered from them; the first time the order took 2 hours to arrive, but we at least got the right pizzas."}
{"text":"Went in for a late slice. I believe they made the pizza when they opened. It was gross. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is no longer Amato. It is called La Mona and the pizza is frozen supermarket pizza quality"}
