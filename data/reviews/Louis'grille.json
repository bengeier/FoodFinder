{"text":"The best home cooked breakfast ever! Really great! Deep fried squash out of this world! Everything is good!!! The nicest people too!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience.  Went for breakfast.  It was crowded.  There a boy acting as host and cashier.  He said he would clear me off a table.  After being gone for a few minutes, I could see he still hadn't cleared the table.  After several more minutes, he asked me to go stand by the dirty table until they cleared it!  I was confused as to why he asked me to stand in the middle of a crowded restaurant staring at a dirty table.  A waitress pointed to  another table, which was clean.  After sitting there for several minutes, I asked to be moved because the location was right by the kitchen and it was very noisy and the wait staff had to maneuver around me.  The two top was finally clean, and I moved there.  I finally placed my order.  The waitress was not at all friendly.  Once she brought out plates for another table and dumped them on my table until she could distribute them to the table next to me.  She filled my coffee once without a word, and dripped coffee all over my newspaper. When she brought my food, she slapped it and the check down without a word.  Never came back to check on me.    Food was decent, just normal.  I didn't like that they put the jellies on the same basket with the toast, seemed unsanitary.  When waiting to pay, the waitress caught my eye for the first time.  I think she had already seen my measly tip I had left and was unhappy.  Not a friendly little restaurant in my eyes!"}
{"text":"My kinda place. Tradesman's hangout
 Home style cooking.  Country. Good folk."}
{"text":"Just found Louis' from a Yelp review.  First few times, just breakfast (they have livermush!) which was very good. Then I tried lunch, and I must agree, the fried squash are AMAZING! Everything I have eaten here is good, and once the staff recognizes you as a repeat customer, you get pretty great service! Small place compared to the place just down the street, but Louis' gets my vote and my business!"}
{"text":"I love their breakfast... Everything I have ever ordered here has been good. Service is friendly and... prices are good,  One of my favorite breakfast spots...I'm a breakfast person..."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Harrisburg! The people that work here are friendly. The food is spot on. The atmosphere makes you feel at home. Anytime I meet someone for breakfast this is my first recommendation."}
{"text":"This is one of the great diners you will visit. Breakfast is especially great with cat head-size biscuits. Portions are beyond plentiful; the food is well-prepared and very tasty. Prices are very reasonable, and service is great."}
{"text":"Only been here once. No desire to go again. Atmosphere was weird. When we walked in, despite being local, we were looked at like we had 3 heads. It's certainly not a \"welcoming\" place. I assume if you are a regular, you're treated better. However, I don't know why you'd want to become a regular. The food was greasy and over-salted. At our table of 5, I don't think there was a single edible thing."}
{"text":"I come for the delicious food/amazing service but I stay for the words of wisdom the old timers share. I honestly have no idea how we ever get a table."}
{"text":"Eat here pretty regularly. Love the staff and the food is great! Philly cheesesteak or waffles for breakfast they are all awesome. However this place is in some desperate need of some updating. But great people and staff!"}
{"text":"Tried it and they were out of everything we tried to order. Gave them another try and same thing. We gave up and wont be going back"}
{"text":"Great food! The service is so so, but it's a diner so what do you expect?
Awesome breakfast. It's exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"I have been a patrons of Louis' grille for years. Breakfast and lunch. I've never been disappointed with any selection. The big Louis burger is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Nice folks with good service but the food is nothing great and the setting is a bit dated.

You can tell this is a NASCAR themed restaurant with all of the race car hoods and sides mounted to the ceiling and walls and after all, it;s about one mile from Charlotte Motor Speedway.  Pictures of Dale Earnhardt Sr adorn the walls and tables as well.  Problem is the carpet needs to be replaced or at least cleaned, the vinyl seats in the booth we sat at was badly cracked as were all of them. In general in needs a good facelift.

The staff is outstanding and we never wanted for anything.  Walking in with the signs on the outside I thought I was entering a typical greek diner and at one time, may have been the case but very Americanized now.

I ordered a Steak Sandwich which had very little taste or texture to it. My potato salad side on the other hand was pretty good.  My wife had a Philly Cheese Steak which she described as good but not to the point she would order it again.

Maybe it was an off day but nothing great to recommend from our visit today."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had at a restaurant. My daughter recommended it and I like it.  Nascar themed and worth the effort to go there."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I would have never tried this place had a coworker not recommended it, but I am glad I did. It has fast become a staple of my regular lunch routine. I have had lost everything from there biscuits and gravy, liver mush, chopped steak with onions and gravy, hot dogs, pitas, you name it. I haven't had one thing I don't like and the staff couldn't be nicer. This has become one of my favorite places to eat and I would recommend it to anyone who asked. A true hidden gem."}
{"text":"Should not recommend this place to anyone. We went for my aunts birthday. First of the place was so dirty, it looks they never clean. The table was so sticky I had to ask for a rag. My hamburger bun had so much butter on it I requested an in toasted one, but when I got it it was so stale. I will never go back. The server was nice, but that still will not encourage me to ever try this place again. Maybe I'd they clean up a lot."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance and I love going there for breakfast on a Saturday or lunch their onion rings are to die for and they have the best fried liver mush! The atmosphere is great there is such a homie feeling and everyone there is so kind, and service is fast. I definitely recommend going!"}
{"text":"Great little dive in Harrisburg NC. You know the place - where the food sticks with you and the smell on your clothes lasts longer. 

Breakfast was great, and cheap!"}
{"text":"Louis' Grille, Louis' Grille, what more can I say about good ol' Louis' Grille. 
For starters if you go there it is a must to ask for Stan (he also goes by Alex but prefers Stan). The kid has a nose for dust and dirty tables, not one table is ever dirty because of Stan. I personally asked Louis' if I could borrow Stan to clean my garage but he's to smart of an owner to let a worker like Stan get away for petty trivial work. It's like Stan has a deep hatred for dirty tables buried at the bottom of his soul. The floor, oh don't even get me started on the floor. That Stany boy is as quick as a fox with a mop whenever a guest has an accident and spills their eggs on the checkered tiled floor. Heck, just last weekend I was there and before the eggs even hit the floor Stan was there and caught them with his handy dust pan. It's like the kid has a sixth sense or something. 
Did I mention how honorable Stan is? A World War II Veteran was sitting behind me seven weekends ago and dropped a twenty dollar bill on the floor under his seat and walked out of the restaurant without realizing it. Good ol' Stan came to the rescue! The kid is just as fast on his feet as he is with a mop. Stan picked up the twenty dollar bill and chased after the Veteran who was already in his chevy pickup truck driving away. Stan, in the freezing cold, ran on foot and chased down the Veteran only to return the twenty dollar bill, check his tire pressure, and thank him for his service, all at the same time. I will never get the image of a frost bitten Stan as he walked back into the restaurant, you could still see his breath he was so cold. But thats just what Stan does, he lets his actions speak louder than words and doesn't care about getting recognition. That is why I had to write this review, to give Stan the recognition he so rightfully deserves."}
{"text":"We are regulars here for Saturday brunch. Lots of food for the money, always cooked perfectly and served by friendly staff. 
Recommend the special; too much food for one meal! Or the sausage gravy and biscuits. Or the strawberry waffles. Or the omelette...."}
{"text":"Fried squash is worth the drive. I double up on it if I get two veggies. Everything is good. Typical American fare."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price

This is truly a local dive, that has some good food."}
{"text":"If the food was not wonderful I would come for the people. So, so nice! My pita was awesome. I love Greek food but the menu has many options. They serve breakfast and lunch only. Even the pop was good. It did not have too much fizz, just right! This is my first time here but I will be bsck!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service. Like the NASCAR theme considering that Charlotte Motor Speedway is a couple miles down the road."}
{"text":"Really great burgers and THE BEST onion rings!!"}
{"text":"Sadly our first visit was met with overcooked food and missing items,  husband never got his pancakes. When we mentioned it,  no one seemed to really care.  We won't be back"}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Harrisburg hands down. Consistently great service. Coffee is always topped off and is really good. Eaten here dozens of times over the last 7 years and never had anything short of a perfect experience. 

If you're looking for an affordable and delicious southern breakfast this should be your first stop."}
{"text":"Louis' is the best at what it does, good ol' meat and two. So good in fact that I compare every other similar establishment to Louis' and yet to find one that even comes close ( yeah I'm talking to you Sammy's, Showmars, Gardenia, Landmark, AJ's (gag) etc...). Im pretty sure my family has helped pay Louis' sons way through college the amount of times we have eaten here throughout the years. So why haven't I already written a glowing review?! Easy. I swore that I already had. Anyways, my crap memory aside...

I seriously have not had a bad thing here but the standouts to me are the FRIED SQUASH (duh right?!). BEST. IN. THE. STATE. if not world. Don't forget to ask for a side of ranch to dip em' in. Get those thin golden beauties on the side of an open faced roast beef (fridays) or the grilled chicken tenders with onions and peppers over rice ( a lighter but no less yummy option, available all the time). Need help deciding on another side?! No worries, the green beans, collards, cabbage, pintos, mac n cheese...all awesome. And you can also get banana pudding as a side if you are feeling saucy (or sometimes I add it as a third, why not?)

This cute little Nascar themed, family owned spot is only open until 3pm so you have to time your fried squash cravings right. I'm having one right now."}
{"text":"Brought my husband this time and it wasn't as good as the first. Hoping it was a bad day for the cook because I did enjoy my first visit."}
{"text":"This place is a great find. I counted eight people working, all of which were smiling. Very pleasant environment which I will begin to frequent. Prices are perfect for my breakfast budget. NASCAR memorabilia with the great Dale Earnhardt and more. Breakfast and lunch only, so don't come on Sunday or after 3. Check them out."}
