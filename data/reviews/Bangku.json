{"text":"I waited for my food for about 45 mins! Ridiculous! The staff were too loud and just kept laughing. After 30 mins of waiting, I got up and asked for my food if it is ready and that's when they realize that they forgot about my order because they just kept laughing the whole time. The store wasn't even busy only 3 customers. Then later they told me that the food I ordered was actually sold out! Seriously, you should've told me earlier right when I placed my order. The lady in the cashier doesn't even know how to apologize, you have to teach your staff how to deliver the best possible customer service!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Filipino Fusion Foods. Very friendly staff and courteous. The cook occasionally chat with diners. If they could have just added some veggies on their menu then I can give them  a double thumbs up. The place is great for To Go, Take Out,  very limited space but cozy."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. Luckily one of the few filipino places that I've been to around the area that takes credit card. Small deli like place with seating.  Around $8.00 Tapsilog lunch. Yummy and cheap. Open on Canadian Thanksgiving.  No calamansi juice :( Seems like no Canadian filipino places have calamansi juice.  Bathroom clean enough. Sink outside of the bathroom. Paid street parking outside."}
{"text":"$8 each.  Ordered: Tocino-silog; Pancit lug-lug; Pancit bihon; Binagoongan fried rice with Lechon kawali;  2 halo-halo con pastillas!  Made fresh.   Hindi turo-turo style! No MSG.  Cr√©dit cards accepted. Good customer service."}
