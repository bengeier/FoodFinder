{"text":"A hidden gem! I have been to Absolute for dinner approx 6-7 times and every time is as good as the first. Customer service, food quality, portions and presentation is incredible.....and most importantly very affordable. Other establishments in the area should take note!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. It is served on a croissant. It sounds ridiculously rich. It is not. It is sublime. The eggs are perfectly poached. The crab cakes are lightly pan fried, the hollandaise is not too thick, the croissant is flakey but not greasy.  Better than I could have possibly imagined.
The kids had a grilled cheese. It looked fine. They ate it without complaint."}
{"text":"Absolute Cafe is great.  The chef appears to be a real, genuine, trained chef.  We had duck breast there that was better than Canoe. Brunch on the weekend was very tasty and well put together.  Not like the slop you get at some of the popular Beaches brunch spots.  I want to go back and try the lamb shanks for dinner sometime.  The staff is attentive and the owner is often there.  He comes to your table to see if you're ok with everything and he obviously takes pride in his food. The seating area is small and cozy which is perfect for an intimate dinner.  Get out there and support this restaurant because it deserves to stay.  The owner has really made an effort to make the most of this odd, two-level place.  I think it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Baked goods tend to be dried out or old.  I don't know if they have enough turn over of product.  They also have a sit down restaurant which I have not tried.  

However there Roti rolls are amazing and seem to be quite fresh.  

After a few bad experiences with their desserts, I'm only ordering the savory food."}
{"text":"It appears that they are closed in place of a Souvlaki Hut restaurant.

I missed their food, particularly their [crab-cake Benedict] during breakfast hour!

If anyone know if they are moving to a new location, please let me (and others) know!"}
{"text":"Rotis are great, and all the baked goods I've had are excellent.  Coffee is also good, and the meals I've seen on other tables look great, but I've never tried.  Definitely recommend."}
