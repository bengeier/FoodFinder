{"text":"The trini double and I met recently and we are in love.  I'm not even sure what else they sell here. Beef patties, apparently. Some coconut dessert thing. I don't know what this place looks like or how clean it is because I don't really care. When I get there I only have eyes for the doubles.  L-O-V-E"}
{"text":"I only had the spicy beef patty. For under $2 its is a really filling and good snack. Nice flaky crust, good spices on the ground beef. It tasted really goo without being too greasy. The woman behind the counter was friendly. The only weird thing is this is a Jamaican bakery owned by Chinese people. New owners? Go figure?"}
{"text":"I cannot understand why so many people like this place the patties here are not good at all but yet they have so many good reviews.  If you're in the area and you want a good patty go to Caribbean Corner at 171 Baldwin St or even better go to Pat's Homestyle Jamaican Restaurant 558 Queen St W You won't be disappointed that's for sure. Ps: Don't try the doubles they taste like they have been sitting in that warmer for days no thanks."}
{"text":"Of all the bakeries in the world, I think I am most in love with this one. True, I've only been to about 25 bakeries in my day, and most have them have been in Nova Scotia or Ontario (maybe a couple in New York), and I'm SURE there are some pretty decent boulangeries in Paris or elsewhere in Europe or whatever - I digress. What I'm saying is that whenever I'm in Kensington Market, I make a point to stop here. For two reasons, and two reasons only:  1. Doubles. Curry chickpeas snuggled between chewy, awesome, fluffy, naan-ish bread. About $1.25 each. Why you're not eating one right now, I don't know.  2. Mini chocolate lava cakes. Buy one, heat it up a little bit and eat it with vanilla bean ice cream. You will marry me based on this suggestion alone.  Honourable mention: coconut cake.   I don't think I've ever tried anything else here, but I'm sure there's more to love. Suggestions anyone?"}
{"text":"Quick and delicious. Only complaint is that there is not a lot of space in the store,  so if the line has more than 5 people it feels very crowded in there and people don't know how to orient themselves. I got the shrimp and ackee patties. Both were super delicious and the crusts were light and cooked to perfection. I'm a huge patty snob, so I was pleasantly surprised. Next time I'm in Toronto, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have only had the patties here, but I noticed that they offer doubles, but they were sold out the few times I craved doubles. They also sell other Caribbean baked goods like currant rolls and coconut rolls. My hubs and I are from Trinidad so we are always on the look out for great Caribbean food to remind us of home, this place is pretty good even though they specialize in Jamaican patties.  I like the spicy beef patty the most, the patties have a nice crisp crust and soft center just like I like it. I wish the beef was slightly more moist and flavorful, I like a more saucy filling.  They sell these patties in bulk frozen for you to bake at home. I have bough a one dozen box a few times before, but beware of leaving them in the fridge for too long, they need to be frozen, if left in the fridge for more than 2 days the patties get sticky and wet, and you can not remove them to bake them anymore :(."}
{"text":"Awesome food and not too expensive.   Great for a quick lunch or a snack."}
{"text":"They're not called Patty King without a reason since they do have one of the best beef patties in the city, except they're not called Patty King anymore, but Golden Patty?!  When did they change the name, or have I not noticed before? I couldn't search the name for them on Yelp, so checked in as Patty King.  The store is really small and on weekends is packed with customers.  They offer their famous beef patties and doubles, breads, plus a variety of Caribbean foods.  The service is usually friendly, but sometimes it feels a bit rushed.  Therefore, you better know what you want to order when you're next in line (or no patty for you).  Often there are 3 or 4 people behind the counter and they all want to take your order even if they're helping other customers. Talk about multitasking!  My visit this Friday afternoon, I had two people who served me. I ordered a beef patty as that's what I usually get as an afternoon snack while grocery shopping (kind of helps stave off from me buying too much food in the market).  Price was $1.40 for a pocket of delicious goodness consisting of a golden pastry filled with flavourful beefy yumminess. Oh so good!"}
{"text":"Got the Jerk chicken plate for $7, and it was not good.  Fried chicken with jerk seasoning and soy sauce mix. This place may be good for patties but not for Jerk chicken"}
{"text":"I love this place, and have since I was a child.  Their home-made ginger beer is delicious, I love the doubles and the patties. But my favourite thing? Their ginger cake. Dead cheap at around $2.00 for two big hunks. It's moist, spicy, and everyone I bring it to loves it. Place is always busy and it's one the gems of kensington."}
{"text":"Patty King is always good but not great. The service is a bit on the unfriendly side and the patties are never hot, always barely warm.  Having said that, I sometimes crave a spicy beef patty and this is the only place to go, as they are always tasty (even if, as I said, they are never very hot).  The produce here is super cheap and once you get the attention of one of the staff, you are out the door pretty fast."}
{"text":"This is the hidden gem. You havnt tries patties until you come here. For a few dollars, fill your bellies with not just the typical beef , chicken, vegetarian patties, but saltfish and asked, and curried shrimps. The fillings are not oozing out, but it's jam pack with flavours. I went back twice in a week!!"}
{"text":"Yummy goat patties! That's all I've ever gotten here. ~$14 for a dozen of baked patties - just have to heat it up whenever you want to eat it. I love the flaky dough but it doesn't crumble and the super yummy goat filling that doesn't make me question the mystery meat in my patty."}
{"text":"One of my favourite pastries, and must-eats in Singapore is the humble yet delicious curry puff. These golden patties remind me of the crumbly pastry and spicy filling that I love so much. Located in Kensington Market, Golden Patty is the perfect place to grab some cheap eats with various fillings.   I tried the Spicy Beef, Curried Chicken, Curry Shrimp. The spicy beef is delicious, but definitely on the spicer side. The chicken is filled with chicken, and not filled with potato so they can skimp on the meat. The shrimp actually has quite a number of pieces in it. It has a good pastry to filling ratio that makes every bite more homogenous.  Overall, a perfect place to grab a quick bite that doesn't break the bank and satisfies the taste buds. For fans of the curry puff, definitely give the golden patty curry chicken a try!"}
{"text":"Went back again just recently and I had their jerk chicken with rice and peas.  That chicken was beautifully seasoned and cooked!  I much preferred it to their curry goat.  The only thing really lacking to the entire dish was a sauce of some sort."}
{"text":"Dare I say, the beef patty was really not that great.  The meat filling itself was very savory and tasty.  However, the patty is way out of balance - it had too much pastry, which was on the dry side and not even that tender to begin with.  The coco bread was good - soft, fresh and sweet, reminded me of the many easily available chinese buns in chinatown.  If you combine the beef patty with the coco bread, which seems to be a popular combination, you'll end up with a huge and unappetizing mouthful of chewy carbs.. not very enticing.  Not sure what the draw is to this place.  Perhaps I need to try their other specialties."}
{"text":"Tried the beef patty and coco bread (now $2 instead of $1.75) and it was delicious! A carb lover's dream!! Haven't tried the other items but I will on my next trip to Kensington Market. Indeed the place is now called \"Golden Patty.\"  I am tempted to buy a whole bunch of frozen patties to snack on."}
{"text":"Trouble in paradise. If you look at my former reviews, you can see how enthusiastic I've been about this place. Unfortunately, the goat patties have fallen from grace. This spot is still a great bakery and has nice pastries, confections, Caribbean fare, beef/other patties, and especially bread, but the mighty have fallen with the lack of oomph at this place. Unfortunately I had to dock another star for prices rising too high. Sorry Friends!"}
{"text":"Patty King in Kensington is not run by the same people as the factory bakery operation in Scarborough, and I'm not sure if they even make patties at this small bakery, but they sure are fresh and hot whenever I've bought them here. I've bought them in a box of 12 and even after getting home they were still warm and yummy. They have other baking which I like, especially the large burger buns. The kind that seemed to have squeezed out at the middle when cooked, so plump and gooey that you can pinch little pieces off with your fingers and eat bits as if it were cotton candy. Then there are the sandwiches they make up. At the rear of the space there is a glass case with caribbean style fish and dumplings deep-fried and surrounded by slices of fresh onion and peppers, ready to go in one of their fresh buns. There is a menu for the different snacks they specialize in, including the coco buns, jerk chicken sandwich, etc., and they are all good! And to top it off with something sweet, their banana cake is hearty and delicious! The customers frequenting Patty Kind are often Caribbean and very cool! Looking-good-wearing-a-fedora cool!"}
{"text":"Truly a destination in Kensington market for as long as I can remember.  The patties are good and so is the mango sponge cake."}
{"text":"This is such a great value. They food is fast and tasty and the price is right! Their doubles are delicious, their patties have a lovely dough - that is light enough to enjoy and firm enough not to fall apart in your hand. The fillings for the patties are great; try the shrimp, its a real treat, as the curry goat. Go check it out when you have a craving. They have something for everyone! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm a Jamerican who was visiting Canada for work and decided to find a spot to grab a patty. The patties in Chicago are pretty awful and I had tasted patties that someone brought back from Toronto. I checked out Golden Patty on Yelp and read through the reviews. Golden Patty is OK, could be better. The price was decent, I paid about $30 for two dozen various patties. I've had better, but it was still better than what I have access to in Chicago...  Also, side note if you're a non-Canadian visitor, make sure you have cash. Apparently they only accept debit cards (Canadian only) as an alternative payment option."}
{"text":"On a Pedestrian Sunday, this was the perfect snack at $1.70 plus tax for a mild beef patty.  My partner tried the curried shrimp for $2.15 plus tax and thought it was great. I came back later and tried the jerk chicken for $1.70 plus tax as well.  Fillings were reasonable and service was fast: out the door quickly with patties in paper bags to eat out of."}
{"text":"Very good pattys in here.   They have many different pastries and they are all very good and affordable. About 2 bucks each or so.   Great place forstudents or people just trying to get a cheap delicious meal."}
{"text":"This place has been around for at least 25 years, and no wonder, its patties are amazing.  Note that the patties here are not the same as the \"Patty King\" patties that are sold in the frozen section at grocery stores.  They have the same name, but they are different.  The beef patties (about $1.25) are excellent.  The pastry is crisp and flakey and the filling is flavourful.  I know that some people prefer the beef patties at Randy's but I find that the filling at Randy's is too runny and fatty.  The filling at Patty King is more \"solid\" and not as fatty.  Not to mention that the Patty King patties are bigger.  The goat patties are smaller than the beef patties and the filling is curry-based.  The pastry is also a little different.  Lighter in colour and flakier.  I prefer the beef patties.  I've never had the veggie patty or the chicken patty.  The fish cakes here are pretty good.  Puffy fried goodness!  They are mostly dough with very little fish though, but at 4 for $1, what do you expect?  The mango cake is another favourite of mine here.  It's a rich sponge cake with a mango filling swirled on top (like lemon pie filling, but mango-flavoured).  I love this place and visit it every time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Probably the best beef patty in the city, and I've had them all. I stumbled across this unassuming shop while walking around Kensington. I got the spicy patty in a coco bun, and the bun was soft and fluffy and the texture almost resembled a Chinese Bao. I will be back for more patty goodness!"}
{"text":"A must-visit when in Kensington Market, I've been coming here for 20+ years.  This year, I noticed they had more choices for pattys and had a shrimp patty - excellent! My other faves here are the rum cake and the ginger beer."}
{"text":"When one is in Kensington market, one must do a food run. Golden Patty made it on our food run list today.   We tried the saltfish patty and curry shrimp patty. They are definitely a twist from the original beef patty.   The saltfish patty has mashed fish in it, every bite is fishy goodness. The curry shrimp while taste is good, it is a bit difficult to eat because all the shrimp sink to the bottom of the patty. So you don't get any shrimp until the last few bites.   The store also sells different types of breads. They also have curry goat, jerk chicken, ox tail for lunches.   The owner speaks Chinese and is really friendly. He told us the patty we got were super fresh right from the oven and told us to be careful eating it.   We sat on the little bench in the store and munch down our two patties. Satisfied. Now...on with our food run...."}
{"text":"After a disappointing lunch prior to Golden Patty, this place was a blessing in disguise. A blessing for the palate and a lovely treat on a breezy afternoon. The warmth and flavour of the patty and coco bread will leave a satisfying feeling inside. This small shop is based in the center of Kensington market-very much like their neighboring shops, looking more like your-run-of-the-mill hole in the wall. The shop has a family-ran vibe and the seemingly typical strict-looking owner has a very no non-sense type personality...it was kind of intimidating. Once pass the aesthetics, their patties are one of the best I've ever tasted. The flavours were very much present, the meats in the patties themselves were very distinctive and nicely textured.   I've been trying to come back, however, living so far has been a challenge. This is definitely a place I would travel back to just for their offerings. love the freshness and simplicity of their food-the reasonable prices-the speedy service-and mouth watering flavours. Hands down, a little gem of golden pastry goodness!"}
{"text":"O Patty King, I loove youu!  I've been eating patties from here since my parents started picking up batches of them for my school lunches (I'm 25 now). I still completely crave, adore, and savor these little bundles of goodness. I never take them for granted and I miss them when I haven't eaten them in a while. True love.  Patties are wonderful little pockets of warmth and delicousness. Outside they're bright yellow and cheery and inside they're filled with salty, savoury, sometimes spicy goodness.  I can't vouch for the healthiness of these little guys but they're definitely made with love and that comes through in the flavour. (They're made with lots of lard and shortening and food dye and salt, but its alllright. I can't vouch for vegetarianness either but I've turned a blind eye when I was vegetarian because I didn't want to limit myself from experiencing such a delicious cultural food).  The goat patty is aamaazing! The chickpea patty and goat patty have a smoother, non-flaky crust that I really prefer. Otherwise, I love the spicy beef patty and the chicken patty with their flaky pastry shell too. I'm really quite fond of the chickpea patties, which have the same filling as the doubles, but I find that depending on the day they can be dry of less flavoursome. Huh.. also, the veggie patty has curried carrots, peas, and greenbeans inside that seem like they're from frozen. Not so awesome. Stick to the chickpea-based veggie options and yummy callalloo patties.  The doubles are really something else. They're not particularly awesome (and not particularly authentic, I hear) but something about their warm doughyness and chickpea curry insides tasting of bouillon cubes/celery salt that makes me love them. Sigh.   This place is cute, its always hopping. The women who work there are lovely. I go by regularly to check for day-old baked goods and breads, which get reduced significantly. I love their buns and some of the cookies are alright. Some of the baked goods i've had have been very bland. Don't even bother with the beef rolls (lard-y and congealed.. maybe I'm missing something?) and spinach and fetas buns (w processed cheese). The little bench out front is a nice place to people watch with your friend while tossing patty nibbles to your dog/pigeons.  5 stars for keeping me coming back for most of my life and my enduring adoration of the patties."}
{"text":"I love LOVE LOVE this place. Maybe it's because I live in California now, and you can't find a decent patty anywhere (or a patty at all, for that matter). My brother is amazing and makes this our first stop in Kensington on my visits now and I am so grateful. Always get the spicy beef patty, it's my favorite. I tried it in a coco bun today for the first time, and it was good but found it a bit bready. No big deal, took the patty out and had 2 separate delicious snacks. And was so, so happy!! 2 patties, one patty in a coco bun, less than $5 for an amazing breakfast for 3. WIN!"}
{"text":"Patty king, patty king, baker's man.     Bake me doubles as fast as you can.  And charge only $1.50!  And see me come back for more, turning my doubles into a home run I suppose?   My wife warned me that eating doubles might be messy. This is based on past doubles experience, where channa curry is slopped onto two bakes, grease and all, oil seeping through any wrapper and ultimately winding up on your clothing. Call that the doubles kiss.  Not so with Patty King! My doubles remained easily edible at hand without any residue falling through the wrapper. Now curry did make it's way to my lips, which were smacking with enthusiasm as I sat on the bench outside of this establishment.  And the one was honestly not enough so I marched back in and ordered two more. (One for wife)  We also tried a beef patty as this is the Patty King. Fairly spicy beef filling, standard crusty exterior.   There's about all of one small table inside here and an outdoor bench. It's more of a grab and go spot. Prices cannot be beat.  What really struck me as exemplifying the spirit of Toronto was the makeup of the customers. (No, I don't mean L'oreal)  Many of the best West Indian spots in NYC are frequented by...West Indians, almost exclusively.   But Patty King had people from all backgrounds, queuing up for some crusty goodness. Old white people, to be blunt, the kind I'd expect to see at Friendly's early bird special, were eating Patty King's.  There is hope for this world after all."}
{"text":"When I was wandering around Kensington in my visit to TO, I started to see people walking by and sitting around with a Jamaican patty and the mysterious modified patty sandwiches in their hand, eating with invigorated contentment ignoring any outside world interruption. When I soon turned a corner I saw a huge line up that led to Patty King.  Surprisingly the wait wasn't long but once I arrived at the counter, I had no idea what to order. But I ended up walking away with several patty variations except the traditional beef patty :S I also forgot to purchase a drink and soon I found a spot in the market and squatted down and began to shove the delicious and spicy patties into my maw under a hot summer day.  I've heard the people use the term \"love at first bite\" when it comes to eating their most treasured local foods. Considering I was just a doe-eyed Calgarian wandering the streets of Toronto(unarmed), I would consider this as one hell of culinary vacation one-night-stand. Yes that means the patties were that amazing"}
{"text":"Patty... The essential quick meal in anybody's lunch list as a meat-loving spicy-high crispy flaky pastry.  This Patty King Bakery Factory in Scarborough almost looks out of place because they seemed to have more atmosphere than the clean-cold look of the Scarborough destination.  Walking inside is of Grocery store/Bakery aesthetics suitable to the Kensington Market environment.  Mild Patty on Coco Bread - It's not a rare delicacy by any means but it brings back many years of memories and lunch times.  No sitting area available but these things can disappear in seconds within a few bites and you're off to your regular scheduled program.  They also have the same cooked items that the Scarborough spot has as well such as Stewed Ox-tail, Chicken, etc..."}
{"text":"Patti King, Patti King, baker's man.   All hail the Monarch of Kensington Market.  Known for it's Jamaican patties and roti, this little shop is always hopping with business.  I'm not here often, however, each time my sister visits from out of town, she drags me here to load up on the goods.  The goods being several dozen delicious Jamaican Patties.  She's hooked like something rather wrong, but still, very right.  She even is pushing the patties on her friends and neighbours. They, too, have jumped aboard the patty train.   Myself, I've sampled a bit here and there, and enjoyed everything.  The King serves up a solid roti, fantastic doubles, and of course, patties.  All fine offerings, indeed.  Need lunch on the cheap?  That $1.25 burning a tiny hole in your pocket?  Here's the solution.  And a fine solution, it is.     Speaking of, I'll add this:  While living in my old neighbourhood, I was routinely stopped by a gentleman, of, *ahem, no fixed address.  He would abruptly shout, \"Looney Tooney for coffee donut?!\".  Personally, I feel that he should spending his hustle on a party or double from Patti King, instead.  Now, that,my dear reader, would be money well spent."}
{"text":"FIVE WORDS: spicy patty on coco bun.  Crisp and delecate on the outside, yet piping hot and soft on the inside.  Oh, the sweet sweet innards.  This item is more like a small meal.  Since it is served warmed, it's great on a cold day of walking through Kensington.  It doubles as a hand warmer.  For $1.75, it is meal sized for most girly-men and girly-girls.  This is Jamaican me crazy!  There's a ton of baked goods and pastries there too, but I haven't been able to get past the patty aisle (no aisle actually exists).  A TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: any patty on a coco bun ($1.75)"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by and grab a golden crispy patty as a snack whilst you take a stroll throughout Kensington Market.  They have the traditional beef, chicken, and veggie selection of patties but i went straight for the curried goat. It's was a tasty and satisfying snack.  They have three other patty fillings aside from the curry goat too but I forget the names.  They offer a lot of fresh baked goods too and it did smell wonderful in this mom-and-pop store that has been a staple in Kensington for many many years."}
{"text":"The best curry goat patty I've ever had. I was visiting Toronto from Los Angeles and in LA, there aren't very many Jamaican restaurants. Loved the variety of patties offered, and especially loved the curry goat."}
{"text":"No! I brought my mother here today, I bought a vegetable patty, my mom got fish cakes and my friend got spinach/cheese contraption.  My veggie patty tasted weird from the jump, but I still ate half of it then I looked inside and it was SOO old that the vegetables were liquifying! It was awful. I went back to the bakery and said, \"the veggie patties are NOT fresh, they're soooo undeniably old\" then the lady said \"oh really?\" and the other Asian lady looked at them and said \"blech\" and tossed the rest of them out.  So gross. So wrong. They embarrassed me in front of my mother, a native of the west indies.  I've been to Patty King at least 5 times before and the fresh buns and cakes are good, and some of the display items are okay but this isn't the first time I got an OLD veggie patty.  You hear about this kinda thing all the time, but you don't think it's gonna happen to you! Shame on me Patty King, you fooled me twice.  But don't even think for a second that YOU'RE are the \"King\" of anything except fungus.  Hmmph! I'm so offended by the lack of freshness. The food is as old as they can get away with and it aint right! Never go there!!"}
{"text":"I got the mild beef patty to share with my husband since he can't eat spicy. Flavor was good. I wished I got a spicy one for myself. The pastry was nice and flaky."}
{"text":"Definitely a cheap eats joint in Kensington market .    $1.50 for a beef patty.  I tried both mild and spicy .....and one in a coco bun (add 70 cents ) ...so it's like burger but with a Jamaican patty instead of a burger patty).    The spicy patty is good!  Quite salty and not a ton of filling but spicy and yummy.  Mild beef patty was a bit dry....and not very flavourful.  I'll avoid doing that again and stick with their spicy beef.   I would definitely come here to pick up quick snacks (or sides to Rasta pasta meals) Each patty is 300 calories each (says the bag )  but who's counting?    I also have a few more Jamaican patty places to try around Kensington market.   Can't wait to try them all!"}
{"text":"Great prices, and good selection of food. From a large assortment of patty, to desserts, you'll find everything.  Bad mon, why is my pone so dry??  Their desserts which are (I believe) made in house, are often a hit and a miss. Got some pone today and it was terribly dry."}
{"text":"Always nice to go back to places you used to know... and always great when they're even better than you remember.  Last time I went to the Patty King was probably 10 yrs ago.  I stopped in here and got myself a goat patty and a chicken patty and they were even better than I remember.  Git 'em."}
{"text":"I love Caribbean food. Therefore I am always super critical. We went to Golden Patty and ordered two chicken patties. When we entered on Saturday afternoon it was very busy and the space is small. The prices are pretty affordable. The payment options are a little funky. We paid with cash thankfully but for cards it has to be a $4 minimum and only certain card types are accepted. The chicken patty was just okay. It wasn't as flaky or spicy as I prefer. Overall unique place in unique location."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from the patties from this place, but was really hoping that the patties would blow me away. It's in such a convenient location, just steps away from china town.  This is a full bakery, there are lots of different kinds of bread, from Hardo (WTF is hardo bread anyway?), to bagels, to coco bread for making a patty sandwich.   At $1.25 each or $10.50 a dozen for the beef patties, they are a great value when compared to Randy's, Tinnel's, and  bakery at bathurst station.  It's also one of the biggest / most filling patties in the city. I think the pastry is fantastic, flaky and tasty. I had a bite sans filling just to make sure.  The filling, however, left me wanting a bit more flavor.  I asked for spicy, but it was less spicy than the mild one at Bathurst Stn.  Meat filling was very runny, but did have noticeable bits of pepper.  Rating. I'll start with a 4, and add .5 for the low price, but minus .5 for the lack of spice.  Final score 4."}
{"text":"Was wandering around Kensington and was in the mood for a Patty. That cause the single taco I ordered at Seven Lives didn't cut it by itself.   You don't visit this place for their customer service (what's that?). You order a patty, put it in your mouth, take a bite and enjoyyyyyy.   This places serves Caribbean style breads, doubles, patties and curries.   I only come here for the Patty's to be honest but there are a lot of people ordering a lot of everything.   The queues aren't too bad and the patties - well - they're exceptional.   Thankfully their supplier (patty king) is located 3 mins from my office in Markham ;)"}
{"text":"Hands down best coconut and current rolls around. Too bad they do not make these available at other locations too. Once they had a store on Eglinton West but  unfortunately that location closed. The doubles are so delicious and the bread is always fresh and delicious. Also they sell the best puddings too."}
{"text":"My Favorite Patty and Jamaican food bakery!!  LOVE ive been going here since I was a kid with my parents and I pray I can pass this on to my future kids!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to find a patty place during my visit to Toronto but I was quickly saddened by the mild beef patty I ordered. The beef patty was seasonless, the filing texture was weird and the crust wasn't flaky. Very disappointed. The price was great though and I did enjoy the coco bread but I wouldn't recommend this place for beef patties."}
{"text":"A must when you are in the Kensington Market. This place is small but the service is warm and authentic. Best patties downtown that are hot and fresh. Careful though - the filling is hot!  I don't recommend their doubles though. The barra didn't seem as fresh and the channa was dry. Stick with the patties."}
{"text":"Any visit to Kensington Market includes a stop to Golden Patty.  I have been going there since childhood!  My favs are: the beef patties ( spicy, please!), the coconut cake, the rum fruit cake and their doubles.  Great services; friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best patties I've ever had. This is the place to go when you want a succulent patty for a low price. Their options range from Chicken to goat, fish, vegetarian literally every option (Except beef, I did not try) is delicious. It's fast paced and usually crowded so don't be rude or in a crazy rush. You can order ahead of time and they'll have patties set aside for you. They also have cakes, breads and everything is delicious! I also purchased the coconut cake because they were out of coco bread and it was moist and so good. Very happy I found this gem. YUM   Ps. I'm from NY so this isn't a location bias."}
{"text":"Can't say I've been to a ton of Patty shops where the staff stands around and speaks Cantonese. I asked how that came to be and the wonder is a Chinese-Jamaican. The patties are pretty solid and they've got a nice variety of them. I tried the curry goat and it was solid."}
{"text":"Get the Curry Shrimp!! This place is so yummy and affordable a real gem! The staff was friendly and helpful and now I want another one yum!"}
{"text":"Spicy beef patty and curry goat patty were delicious. Pone was ok.  Didn't try anything else."}
{"text":"Great patties. Great price. A hidden gem for sure. Service was quick. 2-3 patties is good for a solid meal. And all for around 3-5 bucks."}
{"text":"Update: just bought another $2 shrimp patty that had only ONE tiny shrimp in it this time. LOL.  They still get two stars because their molten chocolate cake and pineapple cake is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Been craving jerk since the recent trip to Jamaica - naturally a jerk pork patty from Golden Patty made the most sense! Delicious, warm and well-seasoned filling and a soft yellow pastry shell. Oh, that shell... - I could of stared and admired it a few minutes longer but I was tantalized by the way it stared back that I instead gobbled it down in a very quick and ugly way. A long time Kensington must. Among the meanest Jamaican patties in the city. Great place to grab a full meal or to stave off hunger pangs until lunch or dinner. I treated myself to a patty AFTER lunch but, hey, rules are meant to be broken. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another gem in Kensington Market. From the outside this store looks like a dive but once inside the aroma of the fresh patties will keep you captivated. A jerk chicken patty? Yes and for a buck and a half one can be yours. Light flaky pastry and a generous portion of filling makes for a very enjoyable patty. They have other Jamaican dishes here too but if you are craving a patty make sure you come here."}
{"text":"They got some kick ass patties in this place. Some better than others but nothing horrible. The goat patty here is probably my favourite. I was actually surprised how goaty it tasted.  Did I just say goaty you ask? What the hell do I mean you ask? Well, most patties, especially convenience store patties, taste the same. The thin amount of filling most have combined with the same spices used in most recipes usually end up making the vegetarian patty tasting exactly like the chicken one. Don't believe me? Go to your nearest 7/11 and get yourself a couple of different patties from one of there patty heating contraptions taste them and you'll notice little to no difference in flavour.  These goat patties taste a whole lot like goat thus, the best way to describe them is goaty."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for a quick, cheap lunch. They have a large selection of specialty jamaican patties ready to go, and not just the standard beef, veg and chicken, but also less typical flavours such as curry goat, curry shrimp, ackee & salt fish and jerk chicken. While all  I've tried have been edible, the flavours are hit or miss. The curry shrimp packs the most flavour, while the jerk chicken misses the mark (it tastes ok, but nothing like either jerk or chicken). One thing of note is that the patties have in my experience never been over-cooked and dried out like at many places, they've always been fresh and tender.   Their $5 cocobread jerk chicken sandwhich is packed with meat and the bread is excellent, but their jerk seasoning leaves a lot to be desired. If they could improve that, it would be one of the best deals in town. The curry chicken sandwhich for the same price is a better bet (although VERY messy - grab extra napkins)."}
{"text":"I grew up on frozen Patty King patties, so coming here to nosh on a childhood memory was a bit of a Proustian experience for me a good 16 years after I left Toronto.   Although a patty and a soda only costs a toonie and some change, the nostalgia of biting into one of these puppies is priceless. While I find the flaky crust and delectable filling to be delicious, I'd be lying if I said I thought that these were the best patties in the world because to be honest, I've had better since my childhood. However, they are pretty awesome.   Caveat Emptor on the doubles though....Not so much. The bread and chana masala filling left quite a bit to be desired. Pass and go for the goat patty."}
{"text":"We were on a quest for jerk chicken and we saw this place was busy so we tried it out. The $7 special (jerk chicken, rice and beans, coleslaw) was big enough for two and we enjoyed a delicious glass of ginger beer and got some tips for making our own from another customer while we waited for our order. Perfect take-out for a picnic in the park nearby!"}
{"text":"Nice snack after a leisurely stroll through Kensington Market.  We tried the beef patty and curry chickpea patty - warm, delicious and flaky.  Friendly customer service.  If I lived closer, I would buy them by the dozen and freeze for later!"}
{"text":"You can't knock cheap, freshly made, perfectly baked, Jamaican patties. I come here when I'm in the area just for a quick bite (usually before heading to go eat) and am always satisfied. I also buy the frozen patties to make at home and they're pretty good too. I do like a gravier (instead of dry filling) patty like you get at Mr. Jerk and wish one day they would bring that option. The staff is really nice too, they'll recommend something to you if you want to expand your food experience. Try their doubles."}
{"text":"So good. Goat curry patty is my fave. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"My trip to Kensington market is not complete without ordering some spicy beef patties to go. The outside is flaky and soft. The beef is well seasoned with the right amount of spices.  My other favourite items are double, and fresh bread (corn bread and egg bread are my fav). I normally get a loaf of egg bread to go, pop half in the freezer (as I can't eat the whole loaf with just two of us). It warms up nicely in the toaster. It's great for make french toasts too"}
{"text":"My favorite place in downtown is knowing I can get a goat patty to tide me until dinner is ready. A decade of delicious made by a charming atmosphere and friendly faces. You have apart of my heart!"}
{"text":"Most of patties in here are ridiculously good.   Note: Golden Patty makes all of their patties in-house with exception to the regular beef, spicy beef and vegetable which case they get them from a widespread patty manufacturer called \"Patty King\". Patties from Patty King are decent, but not nearly as good as the homemade ones so I highly recommend asking which ones are store made and choosing from those. Oh yeah, they serve all of their patties inside Patty King paper bags (as you can see in photos), regardless if they're homemade or not so don't get confused.  ENJOY"}
{"text":"The best patty place I know. Try one of the patties not sold at convince stores. The are all delicious! Curry chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the doubles.  A friend introduced it to me as a staple food of living in Kensington/being vegetarian but didn't quite explain what it is. After scouring the Internet, I learned that doubles represent the Indian in \"West Indian\" and apparently are a Trini thing. They're pretty much channa masala (spiced chickpea mixture) sandwiches that are bright yellow. They are delicious. There is some sort of spice blend that I can't identify (Jamaican jerk spice?), but even in my most hungover moments, the spice is just what I need.  Doubles cost $1.58 with tax and are the perfect size for a snack. Get two if you're really hungry.  I doubt I would ever buy anything else in the bakery, but doubles are on my unofficial tasting tour of Kensington and I love them. I am extremely not Caribbean, did not grow up in Toronto/anywhere with any sort of Caribbean culure, and was introduced to doubles by a white girl from PEI. So all that said, doubles are the best."}
{"text":"I've engaged in many conversations in my life surrounding the joy of foods that come in pockets. Jamaican patties fall into this category, and I love 'em. They are cheap, spicy, meaty and go great with any hot sauce. You can get two for well under $5, and were a staple of mine as a student.  These patties can be found in convenience stores and snack stops all over Toronto, and all of those satellites revolve around the mother ship, Patty King. There is nowhere cheaper or fresher than the source, so if you're after a cheap bite on the run in Kensington, Patty King's got your back.   Beyond being a regular customer in my younger years, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Patty King because it's one of the first places I took my American bestie in Canada. He gave his cash and was given back two patties and a handful of change. He then bristled \"Excuse me, I gave you a ten.\" The sassy Jamaican lady burst out laughing and replied \"And I gave you $6, can you count, junior?\" Ah, Canadian coins fooling foreigners. Always good for a giggle."}
{"text":"My stomach screams for Patty King now every time I'm in Kensington Market.   Pop in, say hi to the lovely owners, and grab a patty for your tummy's sake. You will NOT regret it!! They are so fluffy and light, it's a beauty!!"}
