{"text":"As  as soon as I entered this place I had a very strong feeling I would not be enjoying my mocha. The lady who prepared it for us just didn't have a confident barista aura going on. To be honest, she looked like the owner.   Not only was the biggest cup not really that big, but the whole cup didn't look like it was made a by a professional. I couldn't taste the coffee, the froth was non-existent, and the chocolate was average. I was so disappointed by my cup that I had to drive to bloor and go to Crema coffee not knowing that I was in for a bigger disappointment. But that's for another review."}
{"text":"this place is *CLOSED*. i went there last week and i was told it's a showroom now, not a coffeeshop."}
{"text":"After work Cappuccino was in order, especially when I'm not the one working all day.  All those Starbucks, Bubble Teas, HK-style Cafes around this area, it was definitely a nice change of atmosphere to find this European Cafe shop even if it is located at Commerce Gate where all other Asian Restaurants reside.  Immediately you'll feel COSY as you join the other patrons in a comfy environment with standard Cafe seating and start to relax and have conversation.  There's an LCD but the 10 year old boy was in full control of the Digital Box.  As like other Cafes, you have a few Pastries to select from but this one had some Stellas and other alcoholic beverages in the fridge too.  My Cappuccino was A-OK, a little bit on the roasty side but the froth was done well by the women server.  They give you a piece of DARK 72% Cocoa Chocolate which is excellent rather then the always melted Milk Chocolate that Aroma Espresso Bar provides."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the vibe at Caffe Costadoro!   Love the comfy sofa, relax atmosphere, the deco... OK I love to see all these distinguished looking mature gents in their Italian leather shoes, tailored jackets and their charming smiles...   It is definitely a different crowds from the other coffee shops I been too. It really reminds me of some cafes in Rome.... where some European men hangs out. In fact there are some of them smoking pipes and playing backgammon right outside the cafe...   The Caffe Latte ($3.99) I have is quite ok. It was served in a ceramic mug a YES YES for me.   I have to say that Caffe Costadoro is a refreshing breath of fresh air in this Asian Jungle and Western franchise chain establishments.  3 star for coffee 0.5 star for atmosphere and deco 0.5 star for Free WIFI  4 Stars"}
{"text":"the latte was good, a bit weak, but the nice guy behind the counter was willing to add the missing espresso shot.  what i liked most is that he took the time to explain the meaning of couple and triple shots, from the espresso machine POV.   ambiance - good service - good wi-fi - free.  i didn't test the quality.  parking - it's HWY 7 / Leslie, beware of drivers w/driving habits different than yours. History: up to 4 years ago, it used to be second cup."}
