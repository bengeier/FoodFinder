{"text":"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!  This lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.  The food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights."}
{"text":"Worst Basha in Montreal, chicken dry like wood piece, beef burned like charcoal. Salade only one choice, they have student discount. BUT you will need special FBI card to get THIS discount. Regular university card wont work.  Even shown him my McGill card. What a disgusting food and  ambiance restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located across from McGill on University/Sherbrooke, down the stairs next to Tim Horton's. It's relatively cheap - paid $12 for a plate of beef shawarma with a portion size enough for 2-3 meals. Ordering didn't take long since it was served like fast food.  The food itself was mediocre, but it wasn't awful. I'd probably come back if I'm super hungry and craving some meat for cheap. There's a lot of seating as well."}
{"text":"Nice selection of freshly prepared foods. Very generous portions. Only complaint was the sub-par pits bead on the side. Friendly server made for a great experience."}
{"text":"Tired, steam-table food. Read the other reviews."}
{"text":"I've edited this review since me and my partner ate there and she was violently horribly food-poisoned. Like throwing up for two days.   Afterwards, my gf admitted to seeing a clerk finger-pick-up potatoes off the counter and putting them back in her plate, but she bought the food anyway because she was hungry.   But yeah, she was laid up badly on this one. She had the falafel sandwich while I had the vegetarian one. We had the exact same food for the rest of the day. So that's how I know!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING SHISH TAOUK!   Never coming back here ever. Paid 11$ for a shish taouk trio, brought it home for my boyfriend. He started complaining after 3 bites, I figured he was just being picky....nope! Tried it myself it was inedible!! The chicken has the grossest taste ever...I don't know if it was gone bad or just made bad, but it was terrible. The potatoes were ok at best which does not improve the rating.   Eat here at your own risk! Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Everything I've had from them has been at least edible, and some of it is great (looking at you, garlic potatoes). It's got kind of a gnarly ambience, almost like a corporate canteen. No Boustan, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Basha's proximity to Mcgill is definitely an asset. They offer fairly large portions at decent prices.   I had the chicken plate which had pretty sizable servings of potatoes, rice, chicken, and salad. I had to take some home, and I'm a pretty big guy.   My main complaint was that the chicken was dry - really dry. I'm not sure if it had something to do with having an early lunch and maybe getting some edges of the chicken, but it really held back the meal quality.   I wasn't the most impressed, especially with other really good Lebanese restaurants not too far away. But, if you're in a hurry, hungry, and craving Lebanese food, Basha might have something for you.    Be aware they only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"Nice food, people tell me the price is a bit high but I guess $12 for a very big meal include rice, baked potato, chicken, beef, salad and pita bread is ok?  For me here is perfect for take out. The restaurant environment is so so as well as the service. Usually I will just take out the \"combo\"to the library although technically I'm not allowed to eat there, then spend about one hour to finish the food.  Taste is not amazing but good enough for a student lunch (you have 10% student discount)."}
{"text":"This is a fast food style restaurant that is located across from McGill and down some stairs.  I ordered the SHISH TAOUK in a pita wrap.  It tasted ok.  Never had this particular dish before.  The pita was very thin kind of like a crepe, and tasted good.  Seating is plenty and kind of like a mini food court,"}
{"text":"It's face to Mcgill University and down to Tim Horton. For muslim peoples all food is halal and they accept all age and group. I saw they make order for group but it's say you have to call early on morning time or one day prior morning time to u put your name, phone number and what you need because they will tell you the rate and you have to came pickup the delivery. You need to deliver so go on Uber Eat or Just eat and if you have any allergic or any comment or anything just add in your order to let them know. From the menu when you order & if you have allergic tell them what you need on your sandwich and plate because this way it's better. You can choose healthy plate it's so good. Also when i was eating i heard customers say best Basha & best food & amazing and so delicious. It's cheapest from other Basha and from other restaurant. All grillade plate ( basha grillade, steak, kafta, shrimp, brochette poulet, shish kebab, merguez) take 10 to 12min but it's so good to try. It's all frech and homemade and best lebanese food. They have Poutine regular or with chicken or with beef or with beef and chicken but for poutine you have to wait at least 7 min to they prepare. Dont forget all rate on menu you have to add tx because the law not authorize to put price with tx. So for example if you see 12.61 so it's 12.61 + tx. Try basha on 666 Sherbrooke ouest you will not regret and they accept all card. You can pay by Us money but they cant exchange as they arent bank so sorry for that. The decor need to work but im ok as is now. Just put the decoration in a way to not speak about it and think positiv. To use wifi there is no key it' s so simple just ask the username and password. For thoses who put negativ comment and bad things im sorry for you but it's exagered and not appropriate. Enjoy the meal"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO! My bf went yesterday for supper and ordered Shawarma plate. He got so sick after, vomiting + diarrhea since 3 AM this morning. I've known him for 5 years and I never saw him sick.. just to give you an idea...   À ÉVITER!! Mon chum est allé hier soir et a pris shawarma plate, et il n'arrête pas de vomir + a le diarrhée depuis 3AM ce matin. Ça fait 5 ans que je le connais et c'est la première fois je le vois malade.. juste pour vous donner une idée...  ???????????????????shawarma plate?????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great shawarma, tabboule, and falafel. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a quick Update, Previously I gave this gave 4 stars and you can read my old review below but I have to change it to 2 stars since I ate here a couple of times lately and more then once the salads were so un-fresh (or should I say rotten) that you can feel they are fermenting and fizz on your tongue and not in a good way. I had to trough away my lunch...   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I was born in Israel, so when ever I want to eat something with a similar spices/ taste Basha is always a good option. It is cheap, fresh and compared to other fast food I want to believe healthy. I am also a Vegetarian so I have so many options what to eat always a bonus. I like this branch since its just across from McGill, no long lines and they are nice. It is a little expensive (around 10$ per meal), but there are cheaper options (meal of the day or just a sandwich). Not the best Lebanease food I had, and DONT try their Falafel (very dry) but if you are looking for a fast meal that is a \"feel good\" meal than go for it"}
{"text":"Both times I ate here the food was sub-par. I thought how can you go wrong with some hummus, veggies, chicken in a wrap so tried it once more and ended up regretting it. I took the chicken shawarma and after the first bite, everything seemed to fall apart; the wrap was dripping from all the juices from the veggies and the chicken was dry.  Not to mention that the place is located underground and has old fashioned diner decor and a grey dank atmosphere.  Should have checked yelp *sighs* before comming here. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ORDER/GET BOUSTAN."}
{"text":"I LOVE Basha. As a McGill student it's in such a convenient location, and very cheap! I always go for a chicken pita with extra garlic sauce. The staff is always very friendly."}
