{"text":"Didn't do a review when I got the chicken teriyaki box a while back, but I was not impressed at all. The chicken was low quality fat like meat. California roll didn't taste fresh at all.  Today I decided to get some soup since it the only place in the plaza that had soup. Just look at my pic...I won't be going back for anything there again. Not sure what kind of bug it is, but it's not even worth the drive back to get my money. I will stick to Toyko Cafe across the street like I usually do."}
{"text":"Customer service was fine when we placed our order. I typically eat yellow rice when I get shrimp fried rice but their brown rice is ok. Not a fan of their fried chicken, it's not regular fried chicken which kinda annoyed me because its not what I anticipated. Probably won't order from there again."}
{"text":"The worst customer service and food i ever had. Whoever will go to this place will totally regret . Wasted my money. Dint even finish my food.. So aweful.."}
{"text":"The restaurant looked it was going through more renovations. The was boxes, paint buckets, and bananas off the side. My husband and I ordered our meals and the guy wasn't really listening. We order two different things and kept putting the order in as we were ordering the same thing so we had to correct him a few times. They only offer sprite and regular Coke for their sodas. The food came out quickly and it was okay, it wasn't anything that special."}
{"text":"I've been here before and ever time I think \"maybe it will be better this time\" nope. I'll def not be coming here again. I went for lunch and ordered two sushi rolls. I'm a sushi fanatic and am not even that picky about what kind of sushi I eat in general. (I even love smiths sushi) this time made me decide I'll never come again though. I took one bite and noticed something super hard in my sushi. Thinking maybe it was just that one piece, I took another bite and nope, same thing...I spit it out and literally the avocado they put inside was as hard as a rock. It had the texture of an eraser! I'm not even kidding. I showed my coworkers and they were all shocked. Thinking it was even fake. I've had unripe avocado before but this was far from it. I took it back and asked for my money back. They tried offering to make me another one but I was already grossed out. Plus they'd probably use the same avocado anyways which I noticed was browning. They changed their name but the food is still shit."}
{"text":"We've been here twice within a week. Friendly staff & really good food. Salt & pepper chicken wings"}
{"text":"I tried this place over a year ago and wasn't impressed with the sushi , me and my husband tried it again yesterday after receiving a menu in the mail of their new renovation & it was delicious!! Really good sushi and we took it to go for take out, I can't imagine how much better it is dining in! They have a good deal spending $20 and get four free egg rolls (which are so good!!) the only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because service wasn't the best . But if you haven't tried it lately I recommend giving this place a second chance!!"}
{"text":"Ordered two teriyaki chicken plates to go, when I got home to enjoy my food the chicken was sour, the rice crunchy and stale and I couldn't subject myself to eating this.  Three away $20 worth of food to avoids food poisoning.  Used to be a good place, will never go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi.  They have specials on their menu if you order more than $20.  I only got the sushi, but seeing other dishes there would make me come back agin"}
{"text":"Twice in three days! Craving Chinese food & discovered this hidden gem! My wife & I had a couple of different dishes and taste flavor and portions were very impressive! The combination fried rice was the best!"}
{"text":"Sooo, I came here and ordered the shrimp chop suey. I gave it a chance even though the reviews were not the greatest.  Well I got my order and went home ready to eat as it was dinner time and was really hungry.  I was really surprised to see that there was no chop suey in my plate. Just shrimp and veggies. I was kind of disappointed as this was the only reason I ordered this plate.   The food itself was average, nothing exciting or different about it. Needless to say I most probably won't be rushing in here for another dinner.  I do believe in second chances however, so maybe in the future I'll give a different item a try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really Chinese favor like from a Chinese perspective. I would give it a try again. Really yummy"}
{"text":"I wanted some Chinese food but we didn't feel like driving too far. After eating here, I realized that I should have made a right turn to Panda Express instead of a left turn here. It's pretty sad if Panda Express becomes a better choice. We got here at lunch time and all the food places nearby were packed except for this place. It's almost like watching a horror movie and you scream at the actors \"don't go there you dummy! You're gonna die!\" But they walk in anyway.  We tried the garlic chicken, beef with broccoli, crab Rangoon, and Thai boba tea. They gave us a shrimp tempura roll for free. The dishes we tried were just ok. Like when I was just starting to cook and I wasn't really sure what I was doing - that's what the food here reminded me of. The boba tea tasted like burnt sugar and nothing like Thai tea. The balls were nice and warm though. Out of everything we tried, it was the free roll that I did end up liking the most. But I'm not saying you should go here for sushi. Nope!  Why should you go here? I really don't have an answer for that. Maybe, when you can't make the right decisions in life. Throw your hands up and be like \"ehhh...effit!\""}
{"text":"It has been a while since I visited this location. It was close to the school so I frequented whilst I went. I remembered enjoying it a lot so I returned with some family who I thought might enjoy the place. When I arrived I saw the name was different so I assumed it was a different place. Upon closer expectation it looked like it had just been a renaming. The place was pretty empty when we arrived so we ordered pretty quickly. The place looks pretty much the same from the last time I visited. There are many more items on the me√±u now, mostly chinese dishes. I don't like Sushi but my family does so they ordered some. Last time I visited my friend said their sushi was pretty enjoyable. This time around my family was not very impressed and said it was not worth the money they charged. I personally ordered and tried the Combination Chow mein, Honey Walnut Shrimp, spring rolls and Thai Iced Tea. It was all pretty okay too me. The chow mein was a little extra greasy. The shrimp was kind of citrus like but it was very enjoyable. Spring rolls were not my favorite but still good. The tea was not as great as i remember and they drowned it out with lots of ice, so it was gone very quickly. The place reminded me of China A Go Go and I imagine maybe they are following their success. Service was not very good. Besides a loss in translation, they did not seem to want us eating in the restaurant. Despite the many tables and chair, it is mainly not a dine-in location. It's focus now is mainly to go, which is different from the last time I visited. They also had a security guard. While we ate the guard and some of the workers watched a basketball game and cheered often and loudly. This made our visit very unpleasant. Despite all of this I may visit again to try their ramen and give another review. Until next time!"}
{"text":"I am a man of culture and the world. And I am happy to speak slow, repeat myself several times, and annunciate my words to allow my brothers and sister from other languages and cultures to understand me, but the experience I had was just horrible and ridiculous. I hope that the owner or the employees consider taking some language classes to help with their communication abilities. That, or they tell their employees not to mess with people by pretending not to be able to communicate in English. But the language barrier wasn't the problem, the food sucked. I ordered General Tso's Chicken and they didn't even know how to make it. Also they were out of one of the ingredients pineapple, and they didn't even bother to tell me till after I ordered my meal. Horrible service, horrible food, and please to patronize this stinkhole."}
