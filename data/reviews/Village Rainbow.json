{"text":"The Village Rainbow Cafe is a totally underrated joint in the gay village. They have a great breakfast, a fantastic patio and an affordable menu.  The staff are good and even though Zelda's across the street gets all the hype, I kinda like the food at this joint better.  The mains run from $8-$20 so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Good location, lovely patio, very friendly staff! It's a teensy bit expensive given the quality/selection of food, but generally a pleasant dining experience. I highly recommend the rainbow club & onion rings.  Also, you can't beat the people watching.   One negative? We had smokers beside us....yheck! Hey Village Rainbow, tell your patrons to butt-out. Hardi har har. But seriously. Do it."}
{"text":"Ok. Food? Terrible. I had chicken fingers and fries and am not kidding you when I say it was clearly the no name brand from no frills that was heated up and served to me. Oh well. It's all about the patio. Big patio with the most sunshine... and beer is beer. So go to enjoy a pitcher with a couple friends, and not for the food or service."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I really haven't found anything to be impressed about. The food is so-so and the service is lousy. The prices seem reasonable when compared to those around it - but the Village, and Church St. in particular, is becoming really expensive and the Rainbow takes advantage of this by offering lower prices. The trade-off in quality is obvious, however.   The patio is fine, but if you're going only to enjoy a beer on a patio, you're better off going to O'Grady's or the Churchmouse. The prices are the same, with a better selection. For food? Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit at Pride.  The staff is great, and the food is good, and reasonable."}
{"text":"It's nothing special. Quite quaint, family friendly (at least, compared to the other places in the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood). I got the Tilapia, which was basically fish.   The dinner specials come with a deal - buy one get the 2nd (of equal/lesser value) at 50% off. So my friend who got the $11 Veal Schnitzel got it docked down to $6, whereas my Tilapia remained at $14 ($17 after tax and tip).  The quality of the food is mediocre, nothing fancy. Again, it's home-like. My dish came with a side of broccoli and carrots. The \"crab meat\" was straight outta a can or freezed package. The fish was eh. Mediocre. The mashed potatoes were just... they're just there. The garlic bread, which is supposed to be the highlight of every meal, was also mediocre. I could barely taste any garlic. More like buttered white bread-toast.   The place wasn't too hygienic - the menu seemed to have not been wiped/changed/cleaned since 2008 I would guess, and wandering hands would often end up sticky somehow.   I don't think I'd come here again, given the other food I could be trying. But we were hungry and just wanted a non-overpriced place to get grub from. I think I might try the Greek place down the street next time.  *************** Oh, PS: They don't accept debit, but have an ATM that docks you $2 for withdrawing cash. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"We chose this place for a pint over the other two patios at the intersection and it was a good choice.  Good patio to relax on and people watch, friendly waitress and manager (owner?), fair prices, good selection.  A-OK!"}
{"text":"This place is a complete nightmare!  I moved here 6 months ago and wanted to find a good inexpensive breakfast spot.  Well I found inexpensive...but not so good.  Tried eating here half a dozen times before deciding it wasn't worth the grief anymore.  The food is ok and the price is dirt cheap....but the place is a dump and the service is a complete joke!  There always seems to be a wait, even when there are no customers.  The last time I went with my partner we sat down in a section and were ignored for 15-20 minutes before my husband got up and walked away.  Wish i could say that this was the only bad experience and that I would give them another try...but it wasn't and I will not!  This place is not a good addition to the Toronto Gay and Lesbian community."}
{"text":"Rainbow Village Caf√© is definitely worth checking out if you need a breakfast spot in the area. Though it's nothing worth going out of the way for, if I lived in the area I could see myself becoming a regular (as it is, my brother lives in the area, so I will visit again!)   The prices are reasonable (about 6.99 for a good sized-breakfast) and the service was really great (for the most part). I had the \"all-day-breakfast\", which was three eggs, toast, ham, and hash browns. I also tried the cornbeef hash, which looked great (but I don't like onions so it wouldn't be something I would order!).   So the service was great for the most part, except the waiter, who had been so attentive for the first half of the meal, kind of dropped off the face of the planet when we asked for coffee refills, and we ended up having to flag someone else down after about 15 minutes of waiting. We couldn't even find him until after we got the bill!   Still, the prices are right, the service is decent, the food was good, and there is a patio. Can't really go wrong!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with daughter, sat on patio which was fun to watch the hustle and bustle, really liked that ash trays were on tables! Our waiter was great, he was very attentive and nice sense of humour! My daughter had escargot to start, sauce was just butter and crushed garlic with warmed canned snails, side with rye bread toasted for dipping..i had chicken salad sandwich and only ate a quarter of one half, It tasted so vinegary I couldnt take any more, fries were just standard. My daughter had the burger on baugette and said it had some different spices to it and was definately unusual... All in all I think we will definately visit many other patios in the area before we ever venture back again. Also note they dont take debit and bank machine cost $2.00! Ontop of the prices 33 for lunch"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast all day. They have a platter with everything that you would want for breakfast ... pancakes, bacon, eggs, french toast, fruit, even eggs benedict and more! It's around 20 and you can share with 2-3 people. It's cheap, but the quality is great. Definitely a fun spot for a weekend morning meal."}
