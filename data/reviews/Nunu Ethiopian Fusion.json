{"text":"Their traditional ethiopian breakfast (the Monk's omelette) is very tasty. Very friendly and hospitable owners."}
{"text":"My first experience with Ethiopian food. I was skeptical.
VERDICT: AMAZING!! Will DEFINITELY be coming back here! Food was so flavourful, well priced, and lots of variety for vegetarians and meat eaters alike!"}
{"text":"I've walked by Nunu countless times over the past months and finally saw the reviews for this place and decided to check it out. 

I haven't had Ethiopian food in years and was really impressed with Nunu. The design and decor is lovely and the ambiance is so nice. They burn a light incense throughout restaurant and they have a long bench down one side of the wall with pillows for comfort. We went on Friday evening and they had a guy playing guitar and singing which was a nice touch. 

We ordered the misto meat for two which was essentially a plater of stewed meats, veggies, salad and rice all on top of injera (fluffy flat bread) served on a large platter. 

The food was very flavouful and extremely tasty and the cocktails, particularly the raspberry Collins were excellent. 

Prices are reasonable and the staff were very friendly. Would recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and services we go there ecery week 
Thank you thank you thank you
Blessings"}
{"text":"Ethiopian spots in the city are generally pretty good and the food here falls into that category.  That being said it's not good enough to warrant the heavy price tag.  I'd be willing to overlook that if the service matched the decor.  The service was terrible and helped me make the decision to go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"This is the first place I tried Ethiopian food and now I crave it on a regular basis.  The food is amazing...you'll find yourself eating way past the point of being full because it's just THAT good.

Hint: If you're looking for both meat and vegetarian dishes, order the meat and veg sample platters separately rather than getting the Misto combo platter.  it's cheaper and you get more variety.  The kitchen will even put the two orders on one big plate like the Misto so it's still easy to share.

Oh and on a cold, damp day, nothing beats their bean soup as a way to warm up. I'll go in just for a bowl of that and some injera.  Serious comfort food.

Love Nunu!"}
{"text":"Beautifully subtle, well crafted Ethiopian cuisine. Owner likes slide guitar and plays Ry Cooder. Winner."}
{"text":"What a fabulous quaint restaurant for an evening dinner.  This was my first Ethiopian resto experience and I was very impressed.  They had a live musician with large open doors at the front which brought a lovely ambiance.  They burned incense a few times and the seating was comfortable with many prop up pillows along the bench.  The place was packed and a few didn't wait and looked elsewhere after a few minutes wait.   We were gathering for a friends birthday and chose the meat and veg platters to share... absolutely delicious.  Others ordered Tidbits ( a meat dish) and I ordered the steak tartar with homemade cheese appetizer and was very pleased.  The injera flat bread was fantastic and very healthy - high in fiber and protein and not upsetting to those who are sensitive to bread products.  I am on the search at local markets today to find something similar.  The prices were reasonable and there were tons of left overs.  
My only complaint was our server who didn't seem to know all the food content or the specific varietals of wine.  We ordered a bottle of red and she accidentally brought a glass and stated that she couldn't return it and we had to pay for the bottle + the glass... odd considering it was her mess up... 

Besides the service, the food was delicious and I would recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food I've ever had. Tried out this place after looking for a good Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto. Yelp pointed me in this direction and I'm so glad it did! Absolutely awesome food. The place was deserted. From 7-830 we were the only people in there which I hope is not usual because it's such a great place and I hope it does well! Every dish was amazing. We had the meat misto and the misto misto and they were excellent as well as the salad and the roasted banana for dessert. Much more modern atmosphere than you normally find in Ethiopian restaurants but good ethnic music and place smelled of frankincense and spice. 
Great place. I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nunu twice now, and had a wonderful experience both times. The staff is friendly, the owners even more so, and the food is wonderful. Injera is soft and fluffy, and doesn't have that weird, underlying tartness that many restaurants seem to produce.

We had the Veggie platter and the combo platter (Misto Misto, $19/person) and wiped everything clean. The salad she serves comes with lovely crisped onions in a very light vinaigrette, the spicy chicken was delicious and the lentils (3 varieties in the veg platter) were very flavourful without being overly spicy.

Also, try the Caipirinha and the Tej Cocktails, neither of which skimps on the flavour.

Ended the meal with the Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony, where they bring out the roasting espresso beans before grinding them and serving shots of very strong (but delicious) coffee with a side of incense of Frankincense. Didn't much care for the Creme Caramel dessert (too much orange flavouring - which they should have mentioned beforehand. I don't like people messing around with Creme Caramel), but the overall experience was wonderful. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef tibbs and doro wat (chicken drumsticks)... very tasty! But small portions for a higher price compared to other ethiopian restaurants in the city. Service...or lack thereof...not much to say on that. We live in the area so we may go back but its not my top choice."}
{"text":"I'm certainly no expert on Ethiopian food, but I have eaten at a couple Ethiopian places and the food at nunu was the best I've had. I went with four friends for a celebratory diner.  We shared a meat and veggie combo and the food was excellent! Some piles of stuff were spicy and some were not as spicy and all were completely wonderful. 

The only thing that would have improved our experience was a more... involved? server. Our server was pleasant, certainly, and fulfilled the necessary steps of service, but the experience would have been improved if she had, for example, taken the time to explain each of the wonderful piles on the platter of food. 

We had the Ethiopian coffee service to finish the meal and it was the perfect finale. We loved the ceremony and the smell of the frankincense almost as much as the thick, rich coffee. I'd go back in an instant."}
{"text":"I dined here recently for a birthday dinner and was thoroughly pleased!  Usually Ethiopian restaurants tend to have delicious food but a more low-key ambiance.  There was definitely a hole in the market for a more modern/trendy ethiopian place and Nunu's has filled that void wonderfully!  As mentioned, the decor is modern, there are tables fairly close along both sides with half being a booth with tons of pillows (in a very middle eastern style).  There is also a full bar which also features a cocktail list - again this is something rarely seen at Ethiopian places.  We had the vegetarian tasting menu and it allowed for a scrumptious mix.  The injera (bread which you use to eat the various spreads/meals) was light and the spreads were very flavourful.  The best part is that they have retained the traditionally cheap pricing of most ethiopian restos.  The veggie tasting menu came in at only $14 per person and the wine is also cheap with the most expensive bottle coming in at only $38.   The service was laid back but very good - we were brought the wrong bottle of wine and it was immediately switched for the right bottle once we pointed it out.  All in all this is a great date place for those with more adventurous palattes or those on a dime who still want a nice night out!"}
{"text":"I guess I don't get the fusion bit. Pretty pricy, and can't compete with other ethiopian places, do yourself a favor and trek out to the Danforth."}
{"text":"A charming and unassuming little restaurant but a bit of an odd ambiance. While nothing is really wrong with it, I get the feeling the place doubles as a bar at night. 

While it is a bit on the pricier side compared to other Ethiopian spots in the city, the food is delicious. I recommend trying the Misto Misto (sampler of veggie & meat dishes). There are also many veggie options if you're not the meat-eating type. 

In typical Ethiopian style, don't expect to pop in and out. Arrive prepared to enjoy service that encourages you to slow down and savour a wonderfully flavourful meal with friends."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Ethiopian food in the area and always voided Nunu thinking the vegetarian selection would be just like Addis Ababa next door but tonight I learned I was quite mistaken.  My partner decided it was time to try it feeling tired of the other Queen and Bloor west spots, he picked up two huge portions of the veg combo which we are told is vegan as well.  The flavours were sophisticated, clean and utterly delicious.  I can't recommend this enough and I will be back.  The injera is light and soft as well and the salad with the crispy onions and fresh vegetables was so flavorful and not an afterthought like most of the salads in the veg combos.  Can't wait to have it again."}
{"text":"Love Ethiopian food and visiting Toronto from Miami we were so pleased to find Nunu. Cute spot, open kitchen and delicious Misto Mixto ( Combo meat and veggie) with both Tibs, Doro Wat and veggie options over the gluten free injera bread.  We ordered for four along with some great beers for a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Nunu is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. This is why I love it so.

Nunu offers incredibly fresh and \"foodie\" quality Ethiopian cuisine which suits not only a vegetarian (me) but also regular folks (my husband and friends!) The vegetarian platter is a generous ensemble of delicious vegetarian dishes laid out around a light crispy green salad (with pumpkin seeds) on a super fresh and light injera (they offer gluten free). Their cocktails, coffee ceremony and desserts are also delectable and beautifully round out a sensual dinner out.

It is my opinion that Nunu operates on the level, both in terms of quality and style, of other upscale eateries like Terroni and the Drake and they have the ambience to match. The owners, like their menu, are a perfect fusion of personality and operating philosophy. They have put a modern twist on traditional Ethiopian cuisine that hits the target and like their name they call out for people to \"come come\" and enjoy."}
{"text":"Okay service but over priced for half decent Ethiopian food.  There is far better in the city. Would not recommend it. By over priced I mean unreasonably so for what was given."}
{"text":"My friend and i had the Misto Misto and Misto Vegetarian.. it was DELICIOUS and it didn't look like it was a large portion but it really filled us up... so don't let it fool you!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious - I'm compelled to order the misto platter everytime as its so goo.
Ask for the delicious green sauce for dipping.
Friendly service, good value for money."}
{"text":"I'd recommend if you're unsure what to get the first time you're here that you should try the Misto Misto sample platter.  There are meat and vegetarian only sample platters.  It has a little bit of everything minus the steak and gives you a good idea of what you may or may not like and honestly I can't imagine there being much that one wouldn't like on the platter.  

The platter comes on a plate with a large piece of injera (a flat flatbread) and samples presented nicely over the injera.  I really enjoyed every item in the platter but my favourite items were the salad, the beats and the spicy beef.  I'm actually craving the spicy beef at the moment and I'm 500 km away from here!

I also had a chance to try some of their house beer which comes from a brewery in the Netherlands.  I had a blonde and it was a decent beer.  Very traditional and nothing funky with it.

I finished my meal with a roast banana and ice cream which was good.

They had cool music going all night and eventually someone came in to play some live music.  The staff are friendly and the ambiance is very nice.  I'd definitely come back as the prices are very reasonable and did I mention I'm craving the spicy beef?"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it's always a great place to be! I love the atmosphere and decor, and I love the music - it's the best part aside from the food!

The food is really good, quite flavourful, and well plated. And the service is pretty good. Although there's a bit of a wait, it's worth it since the food is great, and it let's you enjoy the atmosphere. 

Can't wait for my next time!"}
{"text":"We ate there tonight and it was awesome. 

It wasn't too busy, but the ambience was inviting. We shared the mixed vegetarian and meat platter, which was delicious and beautifully laid out on the injera though was a bit on the expensive side ($19/person). The total with two drinks and tip was $67. That's good for eating in the area, but you could go up to Nazareth on Bloor, west of Christie, and have essentially the same meal for $35 (your plate won't as colourful though).

Overall the food is quite good and you'll leave feeling satisfied. One of the more interesting restaurants on this stretch of Queen West."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Ethiopian food. I wasn't sure what to expect. The food at Nunu was amazing. We ordered the tasting platter (meat and veggies) and it did not disappoint. The flavours were so bright and fresh. The service was great. They also have a gluten free option for the injera. I would definitely come back again. Thank you Nunu for the delicious meal and warm hospitality."}
{"text":"I came to Nunu with a group of friends for a celebration. The staff were great and the vibe at the restaurant was great for hanging out with some good friends. It's also very close to lots of places to go out to afterwards. 

The food was pretty good - especially compared to my last Ethiopian food experience!! (I got ill) I tried the veggie platter, which I would recommend to my vegetarian friends, as you get tons of variety. Afterwards we had the coffee ceremony, which I would recommend too - it's pretty neat to see & taste!"}
{"text":"I never tried Ethiopian food before, and didn't know what to expect. If you are in for something new and different, and not afraid to use your hands so eat, you should definitely try it. Great food, nice staff, great taste! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto have difficulty competing with the high quality and ridiculously low prices of Nazareth on Bloor.  Nunu offers a more elegant and airy ambience, a better selection of wine, beer and cocktails, albeit for about three times the price of Nazareth.  The food at Nunu is very good - we had the vegetarian platter which offered a range of flavours and a generous portion.  
Where Nunu disappointed was in the service, particularly as the place was near empty on our visit. We waited a long time to place drink orders; we had to flag down the waitress & remind her of said drink order; our mention of a food allergy was miscommunicated to the kitchen, requiring that the meal be prepared a second time."}
{"text":"Wandered in to get coffee in the morning, it was so good we came back for dinner! This felt more like home cooking than a restaurant. There was soul in our meal! Get the misto misty to share! So yummy!"}
{"text":"This is hard to write. Tonight was my third attempt. The food is pretty good, the service is, and there's no other word for it, terrible. Whatever order you place, approximately 60% of it will make it to the table in about 1 hour. The remaining 40% will be forgotten. Asking for it will require another forty minutes. 

You will not get more water. You will not get your drink order. You will not get your bill the first two times you ask."}
{"text":"food was good, service sucked. I mean, really. 
place was freezing, door didn't close properly. 
we ordered couple of teas, & a beer, which they completely forgot about. 

then they didn't want to give us any actual bread to scoop the food up. wtf...
when I asked, she said oh cuz people don't eat it all & waste it. 
just the bread that its served on, which is NOT enough. plus, once the food is sitting on it, it gets soggy & I'm not eating the centre of it. you need some bread to fill you up, considering portions are considerably smaller than average. 

we had to get up 3/4 times & go over to the other end of the restaurant, cuz the woman was busy on her computer, we couldn't get her attention until we walked over & asked for things. then the guy comes over to chit chat, instead of bringing our drinks. 
I wanted to bring my friends to a good ethiopian place for their first taste of ethiopian cuisine, & ended up feeling like an ass for them not getting half way decent service. for them to not get their drinks, then anything else they asked for. sigh. 
just tried this place called Lalibela, it was best ethiopian place I've tried (I've tried many, from toronto to hamilton, its been a favourite for me this year)
wouldn't come back, food was tasty, but prices or portion sizes weren't the greatest. was not quite enough food for the price, considering I had vegetarian platter, & lentils & beans & bread are very cheap to cook, they could have been more generous with portions, not skimp so much.
 I would have eaten a bit more & I'm very little, don't eat a lot. 

they did"}
{"text":"We had a group dinner reservation here and they were totally surprised when we showed up, but maybe that's just a tactic to get you to have a drink with the bartender. After your're seated, be sure to order drinks two at a time as we found table service slow and infrequent, which surprised me. You would think at a restaurant with low cost food menu items that they would make their money on liquor sales (like most restaurants). 

We did the coffee ceremony and would not do it again. We would dine here again, but only if someone invited us."}
{"text":"Nunu is a great Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto. It's not my #1 favorite which is Rendez-Vouz over in the east end but I would definitely return to Nunu when I'm in the area.

It's run by the two owners themselves and they regularly come out to speak to their guests. The food is great, the prices are reasonable, and the service is good too. That last point is important because just about every Ethiopian restaurant I've been to other than Nunu and Rendez-Vouz seem to go out of their way to define slow service!

As you can see, I definitely have no problem endorsing Nunu and I am confident that you'll have a great time when you go yourself. :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish I could give a different star review for \"food\" versus \"dining experience\".

For food, I would give this restaurant 4 stars. It was my first time having Ethiopian food, and I quite enjoyed it. Especially the spicy red lentil dish that came on my vegan sample platter. Very nice kick to it! The bread they served it with is very unique too, a little sour but really complimented the food well. The house wine I had was meh, the sambusa (sp?) appetizer was very good, I thought the onion soup my boyfriend ordered didn't really taste like anything, and the roasted banana dessert was delicious (the trifle dessert, not so much). Also, the coffee ceremony was very interesting, I definitely recommend ordering it (more about the experience than the coffee itself). The drinks and desserts were a bit pricey but the sample platters were very good value.

Now with respect to the service/experience, I would give it 1 star. There may have been a bit of a language barrier (my friend asked a question about what salad the main comes with and the waitress had trouble deciphering what she was asking), but our server was cold and of few words. She didn't write anything down when she took our order, which I think turned out to be a big mistake. She forgot all of our drinks, one of the appetizers, brought out 2 of our mains (for a group of 5) when we weren't even done our appetizers and then took a good 20 minutes to bring out the other mains. Good thing the vegan dish was cold so I could wait for everyone else to get their meals (the other main that came out had some hot dishes on it and those had to be eaten alone before everybody else though). We had to ask the server twice for the bill after waiting a very long time for her to come back, and she never apologized for anything or even said thank you. So that took a lot away from our experience and is not making me want to rush out to go back."}
{"text":"Rewrite!

Ok, so I need to set things right. First off, as I said in the first review, the food here is beyond delicious. It's the freshest ethiopian I've had in the city and I've been raving about it to friends since. To get to the rewrite, I wrote a harsh review about the service I received at Nunu last Saturday and I would like to take it back. I want Nunu specifically to know that we WILL continue to come back for her amazing food and I apologize for anything negative spoken about the restaurant--which is a Toronto staple and I hope it continues to be so.

I would like to have sent a personal note to Nunu, but I could not find an email address for you guys."}
{"text":"Portion sizes suitable for a pygmy. We tried the \"tasting\" platter. It was very delicious. But the portions were far too small. I felt like I had eaten mostly bread."}
{"text":"loved the food! loved the service! 

Unlike most ethiopian places they give you the option of sharing or having your own plate. I like the food served both ways, but it's nice to have that option (especially if you're with a large group) 

Delicious!"}
{"text":"Sampling plates are awesome. Veggie platter is a great way to try multiple dishes. The service was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"love love love!
Im not a vegetarian, but if my mom can cook vegetarian food like nunu, I can convert!! They make THE BEST salad in town! Oh that salad dressing! We usually get the meat combo and the vegetarian combo. Make sure you try their version of beef tartar, too! Oh remember I said I could convert to being a vegetarian? yah, don't quote me on that."}
{"text":"So I came back with a friend who has never had Ethiopian food before.  Our experience was amazing.  So amazing that my friend said that she always wants to come here whenever she comes to town.  

The vegetarian platter for 3 was so tasty and the presentation of it - of course made me want to take more pictures!  Nunu, which we found out later, has had great training in Ethiopian cooling and takes incredible care in the preparation of the food by ensuring the highest quality of ingredients and freshness of the cooked food.  They even offer gluten free injera (extra cost and you have to ask for it).  

We were paying via a WestQueenWest Gift card. Which was quite new thing to the WQW businesses.  She wrote down the info and said that she would process it later.  It was impressive to have the \"trust\" given to us with regards to the payment as our bill was for 3 people.  This is not usually the case in Toronto.  

I did drop back in the next day as I wanted to make sure that they did get paid.  As I didn't see the payment go through.  Nunu's husband Chris was able to process this for us.  We had also wanted to stop by for Buna (Cafe) side for their Ethiopian Coffee Experience which I would highly recommend if you are a coffee fan.  The beans were roasted and coffee prepared right in front of us.  Included in this experience was the burning of Frankincense gave off a wonderful smell.  Nunu prepared the coffee for us and then Chris came back and gave us a wonderful explanation of the beans, the coffee making process and answered all the questions that we had.  Not only did we have amazing coffee, we had a great learning experience.  We will definitely be coming back as they offer both the Coffee Making Class and a Cooking Class."}
{"text":"Ended up here after a flopped attempt to eat elsewhere in the area. Admittedly I'm not well versed in Ethiopian food, but this was a good experience overall. Stopping in on a Saturday night without reservations was not an issue, as we got a table without waiting.

We went with the Vegetarian Misto (a sampling plate of a variety of vegetable dishes from the menu) and the Misto Misto (basically a sampling plate with 3 meats and some of the veggie options too).
Everything was really interesting flavoured, even the salad. The injera bread that lined the platter is unique (especially served cold) and good to create little taco like wraps of the various food items. The hot sauce that comes with the food is pretty darn good too!

The food portions at first glance may not seem like that much, but it is all very filling! We didn't even order apps and left completely stuffed from our various Misto plates. 

My only critique would be that it would be cool if the servers actually told you what you were eating. I know there was chicken, lamb, and beef on my plate but the only one I could solidly verify due to the sauces covering them and the dim lighting of the room was the chicken. 
Despite the extremely dim lighting in the room, I will say that I love the big hanging light near the kitchen. Very cool design element.

Beer menu is somewhat interesting, as they have some standard macro brands but also carry Amsterdam including one \"test tap\" which is for seasonal or small run beers. Although when I asked what the test tap was I was only told \"seasonal\" without any other detail, but luckily it happened to be something tasty (a Wet Hop Pale Ale) so there was no issue there. 

All in all, good times and good new tastes to try."}
{"text":"My first Ethiopian culinary experience. Yum! 

I ordered the vegetarian misto for $14.. This is a serving of various vegetarian based stews (wats) served on a flatbreak (injera). I could taste beans, lentils, potato...all extremely well flavoured. A tang of spiciness, but nothing killer. It was really good and very filling!

My friend had the meat misto, and was satisfied. He has tried other Ethiopian restaurants and informed me the serving sizes were a little smaller here, with more focus on flavouring and presentation.

The restaurant itself had a modern look, but with ethic touches. For example the artwork was modern, but there were comfy pillows and a soft fragrance of spices in the air. I liked the little candles. We got there around 7pm and there was only 1 other table filled. By the time we left (9pm) this place was happening. 

I really enjoyed Nunu's and would come back here. I'm also eager to try other Ethiopian spots in Toronto! Ah..we are so lucky to live in a city that allows us access to such great ethnic meals."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Ethiopian food and man, I was blown away by my experience here. 

We had the Misto Meat platter and there was so much going on that I can't even explain just how good it was. Everything tasted so fresh and wholesome! We also had some tasty Kitfo as an app. 

Service was very friendly. We really liked the all white, minimalist interior with lit candles and cushions - very cozy and romantic. The giant neon signs by the bar also gave the restaurant an unpretentious vibe which I liked. I also like the the fact that the the kitchen is glassed in so you could see just how everything is prepared. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here at Nunu and I would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service when I walked in. Over priced Ethiopian. Website pricing is wrong and my meal was 25% more then expected. So irritated by the lack of professionalism I got a bad taste in my mouth already. Unfortunate. Not going back there I'll take the trip to blood for real Ethiopian, sweetheart service and save my wallet."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice people.

The decor leaves a bit to be desired. When you walk in it looks quite stark and plain, but it's more cozy than it looks.

The food is delicious, but if you are looking for an authentic experience, you won't get it here, which may be good for the timid. They provide forks here (without being asked), which isn't my normal experience with this cuisine. Regardless, the food is delicious. We tried the beef tartare and the misto misto (mixed veggie and meat) and everything was really well seasoned, and had a little heat. God injera too.

Also of note, they are a testing ground for Amsterdam beer. Tried some really tasty brown ale."}
{"text":"Oh Nunu, I had such high hopes for you.  Having been to a number of various Ethiopian establishments in the city, I was looking forward to this slightly more 'upscale' version, and although I didn't leave hungry, I did have some quips..

- Atmosphere: high ceiling, airy, definitely not your typical Ethiopian place, but then again - I'm starting to realize part of the allure of the cuisine is being immersed in the appropriate surroundings.  Just personal preference, but I prefer the hole-in-the-wall style of decor, but I do understand this place is going for more of an upscale appeal.

- Service: typical for these restaurants.  Food came in decent time but bill/payment had to be flagged for, and there wasn't the usual checking on us for more injera or beverages (though they provide a pitcher of water at least so that's covered)

- Drink: a quick note - no carbonated drinks/pop of any kind are served.  So it's beer or water.  Ok I understand you're trying to stick to a more authentic menu but c'mon - no pop?  Every restaurant serves that, and plus it's a cash cow for them - it's a no brainer.  Serve it.

- Food: ok the real purpose..  For $18(or was it $19) you get a meat platter on injera - typical menu item.  But, for this price I expected more.  The portions were tiny - there was a doro wat drumstick (how are you supposed to share that exactly?  It gets a little caveman-ish trying to disassemble a drumstick by hand), a small pile of dry ground meat, and a few strips of beef.  Not a good value, and overall much drier than other places.  I'm used to the sides being dripping in sauce, so much so that extra injera is needed to sop up the excess.  In this case, no extra injera was needed but the sides missed that certain goodness that comes with a more moist version.  The injera they admit is not pure teff, and authentic imported injera is available though for $5 a person.  Call me crazy - but shouldn't restaurants be making injera themselves?  Maybe I expect too much..

The veggie version of the platter was a bit better - definitely more quantity, and price was lower ($14).  I like my meats, but if you're indifferent, this is definitely a better value (though still not as good as some other places in terms of the tastiness of the sides)

Overall, I realize what this place is trying to do - a more upscale/trendy version of standard Ethiopian fare.  Unfortunately, it comes across as underwhelming and overpriced.  Next stop: Nazareth.."}
{"text":"Nunu stands out to me like a sore thumb. I must say, the name intrigues me so much I just had to get myself over and see this Nunu that was spreading like a bad cold sore. When I was first introduced to Ethiopian food I thought to myself 'Ethiopians have food and spices?' I wonder what their kitchen looks like. I'd order take out Nunu, but that's a personal preference. The environment is nice and chilling. The food that you'd find inside of Nunu would actually shock you just like a blow to the face.  The place that Nunu is located is so accessible to new comers and in a very friendly neighborhood.  Don't miss out at your experience with Nunu, enjoy the flavourful taste while it's not too cold outside."}
{"text":"Came here after a show at the Drake - it was one of the few places open late at night.  I'm definitely coming back here again - the aromas coming out of the kitchen was absolutely mouth watering.  From what we saw other diners getting, the portions looked good and everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy their meal.

Because we were here so late we only ended up with beverages.  They have a very cute bar that can seat 10+ people and quite a few tables for dining.

The service was extremely friendly and taking a quick look at the menu - the prices seemed pretty reasonable.  I really wish we were here earlier to order.  I was salivating all the way home."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Ethiopian food for a while now. Went here for an early dinner (around 5) so it wasn't busy at all. Decided to share the vegetarian sampling platter with my friend which was $18 each. Honestly couldn't tell you what anything is but we enjoyed most of it! There were only a few items we didn't like. I don't think it was anything amazing to be honest, but it was a good experience and nice atmosphere so I would still come back"}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food. Was not disappointed. Ordered the misto misto and everything was delicious. The portions of the meat and veggies need to be a tad bite larger but they were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Thanks to my parents - who drive up from Mississauga at least once or twice a week to dine here - I frequent Nunu quite often.

It really is best described as Ethiopian fusion. You get the essence of the traditional Ethiopian you would find at places like Nazareth and Lalibela but with some twists and turns to spice things up. Portions run a bit smaller than some other places which makes for a great light meal instead of that heavy \"why did I eat so many lentils\" feeling you can sometimes get with Ethiopian cuisine.

Some must-try favourites include: 
*Onion soup made with delicious, rich caramelized onions and safron
*Veggie platter with a wonderful assortment of lentils, beets, greens, root vegetables and a TERRIFIC salad (they refuse to give their secret vinegarette up to me, but it's the best I've ever had)
*Kitfo (steak tar-tar) made with fresh, locally raised mennonite beef, spiced butter and housemade cheese
*Coffee coffee coffee!! Their coffee ceremony is both beautiful and DELICIOUS!

I feel like the staff at Nunu have become an extended part of my family and the service is always great. Ocassionally it takes the food a bit longer than you would like to make it out of the kitchen, but it's always worth the wait and prepared with love."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

This was a great first experience of Ethiopian food! My boyfriend and I ordered the vegetarian and meat platter to share, and it was delicious.  We went for dinner and the lighting was quite dim, so it was difficult to see what we were eating. Regardless, it was a great experience and the food was very flavourful. It was a bit pricey ($20 each person) but that's expected in the Queen West area."}
{"text":"Went to NuNu last night and I must say, for my 1st ever experience with Ethiopian food, this place was very good. The food was excellent, I got the meat platter (forgot what its called), and everything was spiced perfectly and deliciously. The Injera was actually pretty good, I was warned that it was either a hit or miss for most people, but for me I enjoyed everything about the food.

The highlight of the meal for me was the \"Coffee ceremony\" we ordered at the end. Now I'm not any expert of coffee or anything but this was some amazing coffee.

Only downside to the meal was I thought the service could have been a little bit more engaging. As Erin B said in her review below, She did everything she was supposed to do but she could have engaged the table a little better in the sense that ALL of us were Noobies to Ethiopian cuisine and asked for advice on what to order and she just wasn't that helpful.

Overall tho, I would definitely recommend Nunu to anybody who wants to experience Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"My coworkers were talking about the joy of eating without utensils and although I've tried Indian food, I realized that I've never actually tried Ethiopian!  I spontaneously suggested to Francis P. (who is a fellow Yelper) that we must give Ethiopian cuisine a try and used the Yelp app, where this restaurant turned up as the top result.  So my fellow Yelpers, I would like to say thank you for being the reliable source that you are.

I was expecting a hole in the wall place that may have already been closed, but at 9pm on a weekday this restaurant was still open.  It's small but it has a nice dimly lit, but clean atmosphere.  We shared a half meat half veggie (misto misto) dish.  It was delicious, the flavours were very different and it was a little bit spicy.  Eating with my hands was a really engaging experience and I would say that it made me enjoy the meal a lot more.  The server was very nice and took the time to explain to us the different components of the dish.  And at 9pm, she said that they had fresh creme caramel (caramel flan), which we had for dessert.

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Ethiopian food in the city!!!! The place showcases a great atmosphere for fine dining and the owners, Nunu & Chris, are simply awesome!!!

The place shuts down food service @ around 2230 and then it turns into a lounge with a live DJ on Saturdays!

You gotta check the place out!!!!"}
{"text":"More like NONO, re:  prices. 

The decision on a late Friday night was between M&B and Nunu.  And since M&B was papered up for \"obstructing an inspection\", we were left with Nunu.  Looking back, we could've gone to Addis Ababa, but the reviews weren't as favourable.

Anyway, prior to Nunu, I've been to Nazareth, so I assumed it would be the similar pricing...although their contemporary lighting/décor said otherwise.  Nazareth is a dark hole in the wall type place, but I remember paying ~$10 to SHARE with another person.  They had cheap beers too!  Whereas the veg platter at Nunu was $14/pp.  $5 vs. $14 is a HUGE difference!

(I don't think any real Ethiopian person would pay this much for food, especially veg food!)

Atmosphere:  Friday seemed like date night at this place.  So that is the vibe.  Interesting ethnic music.  Ethiopian lady server was sorta in her own world (tipsy), but pleasant, not intrusive.  White man (owner?) seemed very nice, greeted people, and thanked them for their patronage.

Food:  Solid, nicely presented.  The different stews were either cold or lukewarm.  At Nazareth, I remember them being hot, so not sure about the temperature.  There were definitely some vegs that I preferred more than others, the red one (lentils) that was the spiciest was really good!  The salad in the middle was also very nice, everyone was trying to figure out what was in the dressing.  We left satisfied, but not super full WITH leftovers, re:  Nazareth.

Wine, beer ($7 for Stella), $10 cocktails (I guess this is pretty standard), desserts (~$9/ea), Ethiopian coffee ($5/cup, 2 cup min.) were also on the pricey side.

Verdict:  White man's pricing of Ethiopian food.  The food is good, for the modest amount that you get, but you pay for the ambiance!  If you're trying out Ethiopian for the first time and don't mind a dingier atmosphere, I suggest somewhere you'll get better bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner because I wanted to try something new. We ordered the platter and shared among 5 people. It was fabulous! I've never eaten Ethiopian food before this, or with my hands for that matter! The taste and flavours that they use in their dishes are amazing! There was a lot of meat and a lot of vegetables to go around, and I love the injera that they provide because it tastes very good with the food.

All around, great dish! And would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"3.5/5
*Ethiopian cuisine is something that I have never tried before, so coming to Nunu, I honestly did not know what to expect! 
*Service was quite slow as there didn't seem to be a any servers around. There was only one lady who was both the chef and server throughout the restaurant, hence the food took some time to arrive. 
*I thought the tasting menu gave us a fair idea of how Ethiopian food tasted like. 
*For $18 per person, I think the price is quite expensive compared to other Ethiopian restaurants in the city. 
*Would I come back? Yes, if I'm in the area, however I wouldn't make a trip all the way to Nunu to have Ethiopian food. 

-Misto meat tasting menu - $18/person: 
Everything was beautifully placed on top of two injeras, which were also used as \"utensil\" to scoop up the ingredients. 

Initially I didn't like the injera which are Ethiopian flat-bread that had a slight sour taste and a spongy-like texture, however the more I ate, the more it grew on me. In addition, there weren't much lentils which I think some people might appreciate. 

It was a bit hard to pin point exactly where each dishes were on the plate unless you have eaten Ethiopian food before, and in general the food was well cooked. While it was tasty, I found the doro wat (chicken drumsticks) to be a tad too spicy and I wished they would have shredded the meat for us, as it got a little messy while trying to disassemble a drumstick by hand. I found the flavors in the doro alicha (chicken marinated in garlic, ginger, turmeric) to be underwhelming as the spices in the other meat dishes were stronger. Likewise, the Tibs - sirlion beef marinated in garlic, ginger, and rosemary - were quite flavorful but did not stand out as much as the doro wat.

I can only identify some of the vegetables which were beets, carrots, sweet potatoes and some pickled cabbages? In my opinion some of the vegetables dishes were leaning towards being quite bland, at the same time I appreciated the pickled cabbages and sweet potato as another means of toning down the heat from the meat dishes.

Towards the end, I realized there wasn't enough injera for us and after some online researching, it seems authentic Ethiopian food is usually served with extra injera folded on the side, but at Nunu it costed extra."}
{"text":"Service is friendly but can be slow since the server is also one of the cooks. They also bought me the wrong dish but since they bought me another dish I thought sounded good when I was looking at the menu, I didn't send it back. (I ordered a split pea dish but got the chicken dish instead which if I was still a vegetarian would have been a problem). Also please note that the prices are about $2-$3 more than the menu listed on their website.

The food is five stars. The chicken dish was so tender that it was falling off the bone. The salad was one of the tastiest side dishes I've had in awhile. I've had ethiopian food a dozen times in different cities. Nunu might be the best tasting.

The decor is cute and the amazing food far outweighs the minor problems we experienced."}
{"text":"From the decor to the fantastic smell that always fills the room, Nunu is an excellent little restaurant. Everyone is very friendly, always willing to tell you about their food and drinks. Chris (the owner/bartender) is always making incredible cocktails and experimenting in new concoctions. I cannot recommend this place enough!

The spices are always extremely rich, and is always evidently made with care. I've had the Misto meat numerous times, as i really like the variety. Their beef tartar (I can't quite remember the proper name of the dish) was incredible as well. And if you love coffee, theirs is a must. They walk through the restaurant with their coffee freshly roasted, filling the room with its strong scent. And the coffee itself deserves a review of its own. To add to the great experience, you'll always hear some Ethiopian jazz playing, giving all my senses a great experience.

If you're ever looking for something new to drink, the Tej Cocktail is a must! As is the Sazerac if you haven't had one. A traditional cocktail, and the best I've had - the only place I've found that has one to match is way down in New Orleans."}
{"text":"Of the 5 or so Ethiopian restaurants I've been to in the city this is one of the better ones.

I'd been to the Ethiopian restaurant beside this place (called Addis Ababa) several times and had noticed this restaurant while in the neighbourhood.  

It was a relatively slow late night when I walked in and had the good fortune to speak to the 2 owners Nunu and her husband and they were both very nice (even providing a free desert). I found out that she was actually the sister of the woman who runs Addis Ababa and had worked at the other restaurant for years. 

The food was very well spiced and prepared but a few of the hot dishes weren't as well heated as I would've liked.  I'll have to go back and see how they prepare things the next time.  

I'm not a huge fan of the modern decor, but I didn't find it offensive either.

This place is worth trying out and keeping an eye on!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food (can only speak to the vegetarian offerings). This place also has a nicer and more upscale feel than most other Ethiopian restaurants. I definitely recommend. Good cocktails as well. (Get the old fashioned!)"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Modern Ethiopian cuisine. Staff was friendly and food came pretty quickly. Loved the \"tribal\" music. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First experience having Ethiopian cuisine and it was amazing ! First off the atmosphere and feel of the restaurant is a home-like chic with the cuties and most adorable mama-servers who are just helpful in recommending good dishes and drinks. I was in a group of 4 and we started of with Kitfo. It's a spread with some bread but the spreads were amazing and had their own flavour. For our mains we ordered 2 Misto Meat and 2 Misto Vegetarian. It comes in a HUGE plate with all the different dishes and flavours. Now... if you are all carnivores... I recommended perhaps getting just all meat or just 1 order of vegetarian to taste the dishes. Because the meat is AMAZING and you are just wanting more. Now if you're super hungry, I would recommend going for the $21 option vs. $18. We did the $18 + appitizers and it was just enough. Overall such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Here's 5 stars for ya, Chris and Nunu:) nice ambiance, tasty spicy misto; and that Vesper was nicely balanced and cold. Will come again"}
{"text":"I had Ethiopian food before but I don't recall being this good!  

Our group of 5 ordered the tasting menu with meat and veggies and we devour it! It was soooo delicious.  The flavours were brilliant, the portions were just right and the mix of textures between the meat and veggies was a perfect match. We loved eating with our hands and fighting for the food like caveman/woman. It was a really fun experience. 

We finished our meal with the Ethiopian coffee.  It was so aromatic and full of flavourful. you will love it if you are a coffee fan. 

The waitress are very nice and friendly but service is a bit slow. You will need to have some patience here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday, it was amazing! Such a wonderful experience. The staff and owner are extremely welcoming and friendly. The food is delicious, both the vegetarian and meat platters. The platters come with a variety of meats or veggies and the unique part is you have to eat with your hands! Of course they serve you forks, but don't use them, and enjoy the experience. They also serve you a warm moist towel to clean your hands before your meal. The platters are the best deal and very filling. Would definitely return, a great place for a romantic date too. 5/5"}
{"text":"Good food with crap service. The two servers aren't super helpful and forget things immediately upon hearing it.

They forgot half of our order and served meat to a vegetarian table next to us.

I watched the bar staff pour a glass of wine back into the bottle, probably untouched but gave me a bad feeling.

On the subject of the ambiance, it's a nice place but if you're sensitive to fragrance avoid it."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here. Ordered the Misto misto, which is the meat and veggie platter served on injera and shared with others. Everything on the platter was really yummy, with standouts being the spicy beef and salad. I also ordered an Ethiopian style stout beer whose name I have forgotten and enjoyed it. Afterwards, I had a cinnamon tea that was great.

This was the best Ethiopian food I've had. The ambiance, pleasant music, and friendly staff only added to the experience. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice decor and ambience, small space.  Slow and inattentive service, disappointing food.  

The food was overly salty, and not as tasty as Ethiopian food typically is. Also found that the injera wasn't very fluffy. 

Overpriced compared to other Ethiopian restaurants.  

Other than being on Queen West and easily accessible, there really isn't any reason to eat here."}
{"text":"This is a nice looking spot for an Ethiopian dinner; the decor is bright and whimsical. I had read the other Yelp reviews and heeded the warnings that this is not a place known for quick service, so I came somewhat prepared. I enjoyed the vintage signage at the cocktail bar and ordered a Cosmopolitan. There was a 15 min wait for the cocktail (you may ask how can this possibly be? It seemed there was some confusion about who was going to make it as the lady who took the order started lighting candles and washing glassware....um ok...Then another woman who I assumed was also a chef emerged from the kitchen to make it after some discussion.) However after I tasted it, I had no complaints. It was the most interesting Cosmopolitan I ever had, made with real cranberry juice with bits of floating mashed cranberries (not cranberry juice cocktail as expected)- it was strong but perfectly balanced. For dinner, we got the Misto Misto which came with the most delicious salad I've ever had in the center! At first, I was like, what is this- filler food?! Then I tasted it and was hooked! I've never had a more delicious salad. The bits of mint in it and dressing was truly addictive. The chicken drummettes that come with the Misto Misto were fall off the bone tender and everybody eating it appeared to be in heaven. 

Regarding the 4 star rating: 
Service: 3 stars just because they were so darn slow, albeit they appeared perfectly pleasant while doing (or not doing) it with a smile. It made me feel like I was in the kitchen of a friend's house and couldn't rush the cook or something, rather than a restaurant as a paying customer. 

Food: 4.5 stars. Good flavor. I would have liked additional injera included on the side as most other places give you automatically, so you're not just eating the mushy bits halfway through. But overall, very good food."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience! They told me it would take 10min for my takeout which took 45min. Get your timing right! Also your portions are much smaller than other Ethiopian joints."}
{"text":"Very good Ethiopian food. I liked it better than Nazareth (made me ill) 

I've been to the old and new location of NUNus on Queen street. Great"}
{"text":"Great place for family dinner. Service was good, and food fabulous. Kids had kitfo. We had misto misto. Thanks!"}
{"text":"i really enjoyed the food here. that's what i'm rating. wonderful flavors and a great space. i had been looking forward to a dining experience here. 

unfortunately, my dining companion and i weren't allowed to order what we wanted. we weren't terribly hungry and wanted to share the sampler plate. we were told it was not enough for two. we tried again, saying if we needed more, we'd order another dish, but it was basically not allowed. we would have payed a slightly higher price to split the plate, if that was the issue, but that option was not offered. maybe this is a rule they have, but it was not communicated. 

the service was a bit cold too, which would be fine if we were allowed to order what we wanted. sadly, delicious food was wasted and we paid for it. we couldn't take it with us because we're in hotels with no fridges - also a reason we wanted to start off sharing a plate

i want to go back because the food is good, but our server made us both feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the bench mark is Nazareth and this one is not in the same league. We ordered the salad and it came back as a side dish with the main course. It was prob the best dish there. We tried both the veg and the meat combos. Both were tasteless, some items were over or under cooked and the flavours poor. Would never come back."}
