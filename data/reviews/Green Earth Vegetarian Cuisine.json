{"text":"This place is fabulous! An almost entirely vegan restaurant, very reasonably priced and incredibly delicious. My first meal there started with some wontons, my main dish was a vegan fettucine alfredo that tasted very fresh and creamy but not overly rich and heavy like the non-vegan version so I followed it with a vegan banana split (yum)! On my next visit I had a massive veg pho --so, so good!

The staff is very friendly and passionate about promoting green habits but not at all pushy. This is definitely my favorite Toronto vegetarian restaurant!

I rate the food a five, considering taste to price value, but atmosphere and the lack of alcohol takes it down a notch.  While the interior is clean and taken care of, it's pretty sparse and not very cozy.  There is also a TV on most of the time, promoting the supreme master."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place, and so happy to see a wholesome vegan restaurant on the east side. Love the vibe, it's very cozy and the woman who runs it truly loves her job, and is a joy to chat with. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"good amount of seating. nice clean environment. the eye plays tricks, turn the menu pages for more! I love that they play Celine hehe. the food is always so fresh, so very tasty. only cons; service is slow (but very smily!) and we left feeling mega stuffed (MSG?). ask. think I'll stick to grabbing just an entree to go."}
{"text":"This is my first review, and I had
To write this just because I could not believe my experience. It's a Saturday night at 8:10 and I figured Green Earth might be busy, so I called to check if a table for 4 would be available in 10 minutes. The lady who answered the phone replied that they would be closing at 9. Repeating that I was looking for a table in 10 minutes, she said that she just didn't know how fast we wanted to eat. Now usually closing time does not mean that you will be kicked out at that time, so asked if we would be asked to leave at 9.
The lady answered that yes, they closed at 9, and would like to be done at 9. Then asked if we could be done at that time. Well I was flabbergasted that with 50 minutes before closing time I was being told this, and I will never be going back to this restaurant even if it's one of the few vegan restaurants in this area. I'm so disappointed, usually family run businesses care about customer service."}
{"text":"Chef Loan creates a great vegan meal everytime, A holiday Thanksgiving or Christmas vegan dinner with all the fixings, however you need to call one week ahead to order for special occasion meals. The food is always fresh even when some veggies are not in seeason, they some how pull it off. Addictive to say the least, a huge menu to chose from."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, I have to admit.  I love meat.  However, our office is in the area where Green Earth is, and their menu looked pretty appealing so I decided to try them out today.

Yum.  

I had the Chik'un burger with fries.  The fries were delicious, nicely seasoned and totally fresh, also, perfectly crispy.  And the burger was a real surprise, it wasn't real meat, but it was so good!  Also, there was a big hunk of ripe avocado on it, for no extra charge.  That makes me a happy lady.  

I have to say, the burger wasn't quite as good as a real chicken burger, but still, it was really, really close and I wolfed it down.  Also, the prices are really reasonable.  I got the burger and fries for 9.95, and given the quality and the freshness, I'm really happy about.

I'm looking forward to trying some more of the food here."}
{"text":"So I was really excited about the idea of a vegetarian restaurant in my 'hood. But the food I had there has me wishing they would either change their menu or move on.

I think the main problem is that the food they serve here is just so uninspired, unoriginal, and basically, all tastes the same. When you peruse the menu you realize that the same group of vegetables appears in different combinations in practically every dish. What's different? The kind of sauce you get, or the kind of mock meat in it. No imagination, no talent were involved in devising the menu.

Yes, I said Mock Meat. This is a vegetarian restaurant that serves Mock Meat. Maybe you like mock meat, but me, if I'm going to eat meat, I'd rather have the real thing done nicely than the fake stuff. And when I go vegetarian, I don't want to be reminded of meat.

For example, they serve a potato soup. You would think you were getting potatoes cooked til they break down and flavoured with a vegetable broth and maybe accented with something complementary to potatoes, such as leeks, as is normally the case when you call something potato soup. But what you get is cubes of just-cooked potatoes in a bizarre \"creamy\" broth (I can't figure out what the broth is made of, or what makes it creamy - it was very unsettling), green peas, and yes, pieces of Mock Meat. All in all, none of the flavours jived together nicely at all, the broth was unpleasant, and it was a very disappointing potato soup indeed. An example of someone trying to be creative but it doesn't quite come together.

For my main I had what amounted to a plate of standard veggies in a sauce on rice. Boring. You'd be better off going to one of the many, cheaper Chinese restaurants practically beside the restaurant to have this dish than to bother with it here. I think people with even modest culinary ability can make better for themselves than what you get here. For the money, I expect something better than what I can make at home.

Oh, and the server was very judgemental if you didn't eat everything on your plate. So remind me, how does this work? I pay YOU to give me attitude for not wanting to finish every last piece of disappointing, unoriginal, overpriced food? NO - I'm the one paying the bills here. I think someone needs to go back to customer service school, or charm school, or whatever they call it.

If you want good, vegetarian cuisine served in creative, inspiring dishes, you're better off going to Fresh on Bloor & Spadina (or at Crawford & Queen, or Spadina south of Queen), or any of the other restaurants on this list: http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_vegetarian_restaurants_in_toronto/"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times & have yet to be disapointed. Excellent food @ very resonable prices. Not the greatest interior, but cozy with good company."}
{"text":"I adore this place, and pick up dinner from it weekly. 

Favorites dishes are the Golden Noodle Soup and Chick'un Burger, but there are a bunch of tasty offerings."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now and I'm just not really feeling it. On the plus side, they have a huge vegan selection, including tons of gluten-free options, they have vegan cheesecake (always a plus for me) albeit on gluten-y crust, their prices are reasonable (average/moderate food price), the service is friendly and they are very accommodating for large groups and splitting bills.

On the not-so-great side, the portions are a bit small, and the food isn't anything too special/great, with little variety and even less flavour. I've had the spicy lemon grass tofu, which was tasty but was JUST tofu and rice with NO vegetables! The second time I was there I had the pho, which was veggie broth with a TON of rice noodles and a couple veggies. This time I had the sweet and sour veggie and tofu meal - they were out of brown rice so I had to have white (yuck), the sauce was super watery, there were only 3 pieces of tofu and the veggies weren't that great (mostly just overcooked carrots).

I really want to like this place. It's great in theory and I find the tv playing the supreme leader channel kind of hilarious. But I am continually disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the freshest and most delicious food in Toronto. Low priced lunch specials. The owner used organic when possible and fresh ingredients daily. The Vietnamese dishes are my fave- but they also make the best vegan \"chicken\" burger I've ever tasted. Try the Lemongrass Tofu but opt for \"soy proteins\" instead of tofu. The Ph? and Hue Noodle soup are excellent meals unto themselves. Cold rolls (Spring Rolls and Summer Rolls) are great starters. I LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Leaning into the veggie lifestyle and discovering some very tasty places.  This is definitely one I'll be visiting again.  The eggplant medley had so much flavour and just the right amount of spice...mmm.  The space is not huge so depending on the clientele, conversations can carry.  The decor is simple and service friendly.  For some reason though, it has not always been open during business hours."}
{"text":"A nice, little clean place on Broadview, it was empty when my boyfriend and I walked in. Overall, good atmosphere except for that it was so quiet. 

We started off with the crispy nuggets - delicious! The best vegetarian nugget I think I've ever eaten. 

My boyfriend ordered the bbq burger - which he enjoyed. 

I had the chow mien which was also delicious. 

The menu is huge and it was hard to decide what to get. Reasonably priced. Our entire meal came to under $20 . 

Staff was attentive and food service was quick. I will definitely make another trip for sure. ... probably several visits."}
{"text":"I find the food to be just OK. Nothing special. The service is actually sort of weird...in that the waitress stares blankly and is generally unhelpful. An real conversation that occurred...on TWO separate occasions:
Waitress: \"White or brown rice?\"
Me: \"White\"
Waitress: \"We don't have white rice here.\"
Me: \"Um....?\""}
{"text":"All I  gotta say is GREEN EARTH IS AMAZING.
the entire menu is seriously the best, this place is like vegan heaven on earth.
its a cute little place and the waitress is usually this little old lady when ever i go in there, she is so sweet.

try the chicken parm, wonton soup, cold rolls, burritos
just try the whole menu!

only bad thing about this place is that its in the east end"}
{"text":"You know, personally, I enjoy soy protein. Sure it's not the real thing, and it isn't fooling anyone, but the texture is there and it takes on whatever delicious flavour you order. 

I was pleased with my sweet and sour sensation with soy protein and fresh vegetables. Green Earth is clearly dedicated to their vegetarian style with lots of options and flavours to choose from. My friends ordered a regular hot and sour soup & a harvest pumpkin soup, which was surprisingly delivered in a massive bowl. Also, a harvest salad, brimming with colour and warmed vegetables, it was a good order. 

If good food is what you're after, and a view of the historic Riverdale Library, this is the place."}
{"text":"Whohoo! Paradise! ALL is suitable for vegetarians as us! A M A Z I N G.

We arrived there late Friday night, they are open until 9 PM, six other people were present. We were starving, so we cut to the stuff after ever so friendly server Astrid poured us huge glasses of lemon water. Good start, as it started with a smile! :)

We ordered three flavors and supreme burrito. Both meals were under $10, had very good flavors, were served hot and tasty, our water glasses were kept full by kind Astrid constantly. The portions were big enough to finish and after that we were bloated :D So no room for dessert, which was kindly offered to us. 

One thing I would still love to add, is the fact it was pretty cold in a chilly evening, as I had to cover my lap with my jacket, as all the nicer places were occupied. Bathroom is excellent, but the dining room could do better. That didn't bother us enjoying the food :)

Reading other not so good reviews makes me to check that place out more, as I see there is lots to discover, so far we are very satisfied and happy for the experience."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favourite VEGAN places in the city. I hate going to places that have \"mock meats\" that are vegetarian because they contain whey and such.
The food is always my favourite, usually when we go to eat we can get a lot for your money. Their sushi is my favourite, and I love their rice bowls, and chow mein. I've tried their burgers and wraps which I also enjoy a lot. Very friendly and enjoyable place."}
{"text":"Take this review with a grain of (vegan-earth-friendly) salt, for I am not the biggest fan of vegetarian cuisine. Perhaps I just can't get over that whole \"fake meat\" thing. 

All the same, the dishes here are reasonably priced, the food is good, and service is nothing to complain about.

I went here with my veggie sister and she, being a huge fake meat fan, ordered the sweet and sour \"meat\" with choice of brown or white rice. I tried a piece of it and it tasted reasonably okay. I went with the Riz Colonial, a curry-based dish made with various grilled vegetables and fruits, including pineapple, apple, and strawberries on a bed of brown rice. Tasty and filling, though not terribly thrilled about the surprise faux tiger shrimp that was thrown in there. Anyone else may have been happy about that.

Atmosphere is warm and welcoming, albeit very casual, and the constant broadcast of a spiritual channel on a television on the wall is a little off-putting, but altogether, a place I wouldn't be opposed to going to again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite east end spots. I usually get the california wrap and tom yum soup, but any other dishes i've seen look really good too. Their smoothies are really thick and flavourful. The nugget appetizer is a great starter too. Last two times I have ordered the portions were on the lighter side but still tasty as all hell"}
{"text":"Small neighborhood vegan restaurant with old fashioned vegetarian selections. Good food, but we come here often for the amazing chocolate cake...nothing like it anywhere in T.O."}
{"text":"This place is terrific, friendly staff, fast service, casual atmosphere, great tasting & healthy food for reasonable prices gets 5 Stars from me!

Would highly recommend, have been back several times, taken several friends there, all had very positive experiences, will definitely dine there again."}
{"text":"I will not be back.
I came into this place (for the second time) on a cold wintry day; there were two other solo diners in the place.
I ordered a dish of rice noodles and mixed veggies (minus the tofu plus extra veggies) for $12.
When the server (I'm guessing the owner's teenage daughter?) came back with my plate, I wanted to laugh out loud (Am I on a diet, I asked myself?) 
The portion was ridiculously small...I think I counted 10 skinny rice noodles. I wish I had taken a photo to show the absurdity of this dish and its price. 
There was no broccoli on my dish as the menu had promised. When I pointed this out to the server, she told me she would get me some. She came back with four (4) bite-sized broccoli bits on a plate that had way too much leftover space and made the 'extra veggies' amount look even more ridiculous.
When I told the server that this broccoli portion was ridiculously small, she told me that the menu was wrong and that there was not supposed to be any broccoli...!!?? She further explained that the portions were small because they had just opened a second restaurant location...
What does is have to do with me and my $12 child-sized portion of rice noodles and veggies? Nothing. 
I was not dining at their second location.

That is why I will not be back.
Nor will I recommend this place to my fellow Veg-/Vegans/Omnis.

This is bad business."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The chick-un wrap, burrito, tacos, tom yum, hot sour soup, cold roll, hummus, mango smoothie, chocolate cake, and green tea cheesecake were all amazing."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  No matter what mood you are in they will likely have something that fits it.  Feel like a burger and fries, yup.  Soup and Salad, yup.  Spring Rolls, yup.  Curry dishes, they've got that too.  It's a safe place to take both vegan and non vegans as the variety should satisfy everyone at your table.

I took my mom here recently so she could try one of my vegan restaurants.  She got the vegetable medley and i the curry.  We both enjoyed our meals but what stole the show were the crispy rolls.  We got some as an appetizer and then got another order after our meals as well as they were so good.

I would recommend this restaurant and i look forward to going back and trying more of the food there.  The service was good and the people there are really nice."}
{"text":"Anywhere that decides to make banana spring rolls and serve it up with a nice scoop of choc-chip soy ice cream is just fine by me! And the more I eat, the closer in size I become to a Green Earth.. (Especially thanks to the irressistable crispy nuggets appetizer.)

This unassuming little vegetarian restaurant on Broadview does offer a stunning variety of non-dessert foods also - a sometimes strange mixed offering of asian and more 'western' type foods, there's a great range of app, soups, salads, mains & house specials.

If you enjoy it, there's loads of soy protein faux-meats on offer (well made so the flavour and textures aren't weird though) - but it doesn't overwhelm the menu so if you want to stick to something simpler you can. They also don't use non-dairy cheeses or creams here, instead crafting meals that are delicious without needing these subs. The mains are generous portions, and all the food is fresh & tasty. 

The atmosphere here is pretty quiet (unless you come for a holiday meal, in which case it can get packed - but everything's still tasty, fresh and worth it). Staff are friendly and attentive, and helpful with any questions about the menu, too. 

With a menu their size, I probably would end up the size of a planet if I tried to work my way through it all, but i'd like to get back there a few more times to try a mix of their offerings - be it a burger, noodle dish, pasta or a sandwich."}
{"text":"Some disclaimers:  First, though I am picky about it, I happen to like some faux meat.  I am certainly open to trying it.  

Second, I tried Green Earth when they were at the Toronto Vegetarian Food Fair this past weekend, so my review doesn't include wait times, service, atmosphere, etc.  I'm strictly talking the food, which was awesome.  

Their menu is so extensive, it's almost overwhelming!  I can get vegan burritos, burgers, pasta like alfredo, OR I could have wanton soup, curry, or sushi.  

I haven't tried the sushi yet, but the food I did try and sample was pretty nice.  I'm definitely going to make a point to stop in the actual cafe next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First, full disclosure, I am not a vegan and second I don't understand why all the tofu and fake meat. As a non-vegan, if i go to a place like this, I'm here for something different and the vegan experience not for meat substitutes. If one is vegan, why would one want to eat fake meat. That's like eating a vegetarian hot dog, why eat an imitation anything.  Anyway, back to green earth. The food was only OK and laced with too much tofu as a substitute for meat.  I wouldn't go back..."}
{"text":"Have been here several times now. Very cute and cozy place. Just ignore what is playing on the TV and you will be fine. 

Foodwise I have only had their \"asian\" dishes which I love especially the hot and sour soup, summer rolls, quinoa sushi, and various rice dishes. The portobello burger is so good that hubby will not order anything else."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, I've almost become a regular! The menu is so vast so I get something new every time and I'm almost never disappointed. They often run out of their popular dishes like the chick'un nuggets and the green tea cheesecake, so that can be a tad annoying. They've got all kinds of foods: pastas, sandwiches, tacos, burgers. The best part is the price, it's super affordable for very big portions!! The food comes pretty quickly and the servers are always kind and considerate. It's not the nicest restaurant on the eyes, the decor is nothing fancy, kind of dates. But the food and prices make up for all of that. The service is not bad, they come by whenever required. This place is just not over the top, to say the least! But Green Earth might just be my favourite restaurant for an affordable vegan meal and I will never stop coming here!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great place with some great vegan food? Look no further! This is a corner in the wall located in down town Toronto. The venue itself is small, not too fancy.  When we went on a Friday lunch, there was no one else at the restaurant and one one person working. The waitor was really nice and attentive to us. Here's what I thought of each dish.


Green Earth Rotisserie
This was my favorite dish. It is a piece of  roasted soy chicken with rice, carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. The soy chicken is so good. It's flavoured very nicely and super thick with their chefs sauce. The soy is made so it's very chewy but not to hard to chew through.  It's definitely one of those dishes that when you eat  it you couldn't believe it's vegan. The dish was filling and came in a great portion for $12. 

Alfredo Pasta
This was also very delicious. It was pasta with vegan Alfredo sauce and soy chicken. The soy chicken was exactly the same as the rotisserie. Super chewy but super flavored. They gave alot of pieces in the pasta. The Alfredo sauce was also very creamy, more on the sweet wide which is the way I liked it. The pasta looked like it was made in house. Overall, the dish was filling and left me wanting more! 

Quinoa sushi
I had no expectations walking into this one. This dish is a starter, sushi made with quinoa. It was OKAY.  There was no special flavouring added. It came with a couple of different rolls and soy sauce. Some rolls were better than others. It was pretty messy to eat cause it kept falling apart. Probably wouldn't order this again. 

Summer rolls
I wasn't the best fan of this. It was plain vegetables wrapped up. No seasoning or any sauce. It came with penut sauce which didn't match the dish, just seemed out of place. 

Chocolate cake & Matcha cheese cake

The desserts were yummy! The portions are small which is fine since the overall meal was huge. The chocolate cake was smooth and easy to cut through. The match cheese cake lacked the matcha flavour but still had a delclious cheese cake taste to it."}
{"text":"We are vegetarian's and regular's at Green Earth, and there's a reason.  Amazing and huge selection of veggie meals. All I can say is....YUM!   You don't have to be a vegetarian to like this restaurant.  All of our meat-eating friend's enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"Oh my Lord, I love this place!!! I would eat here every day if I could. 5+ stars for the food.The decor/atmosphere could be more inviting. But anyway, back to the great food...I've tried many different dishes here and they've all tasted fresh, lovingly prepared and just delicious. I especially like the rice dishes and I love the fact that you can get brown rice (my favourite). The Green Earth rotisserie (which comes with a yummy sauce that I think I could drink it's so good) is one of my favourites. If you want healthy, delicious food, this is the place to go. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I recently found out i have a gluten intolerance-- this place was heaven for a gluten free vegan who was a little depressed over the diagnosis.. I drowned my sorrows in a sundae before dinner. then i ordered gf spring rolls and nachos.. and then another sundae after dinner.. my dining companion has a noodle bowl of some sort- the bill came to 33 bucks.. 
The service was good. the food was good.. and there was so much selection for gf vegans.. so happy! yumm. will become my new spot"}
{"text":"This is where I go when Simon's Wok is closed. They have good selection but many of their dishes just aren't particularly memorable."}
{"text":"I had the rotisserie chick-un and husband had the Indian curry! I was so full but kept eating. Super good! I feel it was exactly as described. I like to eat healthy and I don't like surprises like heavy sauces not listed on the menu. So very happy here! Would recommend and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Green Earth, for being there when I needed vegetarian food for a family of 3. I was so glad to find this place and discover I could get delivery via DoorDash. Lots of variety on the menu, just what I needed when the alternative was driving somewhere and maybe having something we could eat and maybe something my preschooler would tolerate. Food was fine, nothing to write home about but no problems. The hummus was very good."}
{"text":"I went here for Thanksgiving this past weekend. Everything was delicious, especially the pumpkin cheesecake! The food reminded me a lot of past Thanksgiving dinners at home, (hearty and wholesome food). The service was great too! I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time with my partner and child. They both like it more than I do. I don't mind it, but I don't think the food is as carefully prepared as at other vegan/vegetarian restaurant. The flavours are not careful. Sort of too salty and too sweet but not alway flavourful. Does that make sense? That being said, sometimes it's just right for what we want -- it hits the spot, and there is a nice variety of options to choose from, everything vegan from apps to desserts. The service has been good when we've gone, and they are very considerate and welcoming to us including our child. Perfect when you need fairly inexpensive and cheerful quick food."}
{"text":"lovely staff- the lady in charge (I assume) is so helpful and welcoming. 
the first time I went here I had the bbq chicken burger. there wasn't as much sauce i'd have liked, but the chicken burger was awesome- a big steak, almost! I also had the summer rolls which came with such a nice peanut dipping sauce.

the other night, I went for the rotisserie chicken with rice, only I asked for the peanut sauce again instead of the regular sauce- I guess like a satay chicken. so so good! the sauce was kinda light and not as thick as a regular satay sauce, but it was still lovely, and it was so kind of the staff to make for me as it wasn't actually on the menu.

great place!"}
{"text":"This place is a haven for home cooked vegan food. I last stopped in on Sunday and enjoyed the chicken with mashed potatoes, vegetables, and rice. To top it off I took home a piece of the chocolate cake and I'm still craving more."}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for three years now and it's sometimes difficult to find restaurants to dine at in the city (with good food and prices).

With that being said, Green Earth is amazing. The staff is welcoming and friendly; the food is great and the prices are affordable.

I purchased two Thanksgiving dinners this year for me and my mum and we loved them. We ate every last bite! I will definitely be returning to try out some new items on the menu. (or at least go back for the pumpkin cheesecake) *drools*"}
{"text":"Came to this place upon the suggestion of Yelp and it didn't disappoint. We ordered the hot and sour soup (the small is really huge), bruschetta (soft bread, really yummy), and I ordered the chick-un burger (love the raw onion on there). The fries were seasoned really well and the vegan mayo was super yummy. The burger wasn't too greasy. 

The service was great. Very friendly and we were served our food in a speedy amount of time. If you're looking for a place in terms of decor and environment, maybe it's not your spot, but for good grub and a casual atmosphere-it is a great choice."}
{"text":"Awesome and inventive vegetarian dishes. The Three Flavours (Pumpkin, eggplant, tofu, onions, sweet basil, bell peppers and mushrooms in a sauce) is incredible, as is the spicy Indian curry tofu. Tons of gluten-free options, too, including QUINOA SUSHI. It sounds weird, but it's oh so good. Tiny and charming and weirdly located right across from the Don Jail. 

ACCESSIBILITY: The restaurant is flat-entry. I don't know about the accessibility of the bathrooms here, since I've never used them."}
{"text":"We love Green Earth! So many vegan options of different types of cuisines. You can go with sandwiches or Asian dishes. I still need to try their pasta dishes.

Our go to favourites are:

- fries
- summer rolls
- philly star sandwich (better without Daiya)
- golden crispy rolls
- orange imagination
- hot and sour soup

Staff are always friendly and accomodating. 

Note: Location is accessible. Ramp at entrance and washrooms on same floor with grab bars."}
{"text":"Have heard great things about this restaurant and I wanted to try it for awhile. Had the harvest burger. It was just okay. I'm not into the whole fake meat thing and would have preferred a patty with a mix of veg, soy and grains instead of a \"soy steak\". The mayo was also good but odd tasting. Slightly sweet? I also found the burger difficult to eat because the patty was so incredibly thick. Lastly, the salad was not fresh! I definitely want to try other things on the menu but my first experience was not great."}
{"text":"To make to short the place has good food. The sushi is amazing! The service was always been friendly expect the last time I went where the waitress was to busy to care about are table. The place looks kinda cheap but whatever. I'm not a fan because if I order gluten free food & then they bring me food that is not gluten free & I get sick. When I told them about it the following time the lady was to busy to care & was like \" well do something about it next time your here\". I'll never be back. I have no time for the stupidity."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the pricing is quit decent. However, I'm not digging the interior design of the place. The mirrors covering the left side of the wall makes the place look cheap.

I'm actually surprised in regards to how tiny the restaurant is - yet it never seems to get full! I believe there are only about 5 - 6 tables in there.

If any of you decides to visit Green Earth, try their Rainbow soup. It's very hearty and thick, one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"I was forced to go there cuz my GF heard good things about it. I told her \"listen here, im a carnivore i don't eat only vegetables\" Good thing i ended up going, i think this place is a hidden jewel. food is beyond good and i just wanted to keep going back just to try something else and figure out how on earth did they manage to make things soo good and close to what it would taste even tho no meat or dary was present. oh and always start with the nachos, so good. And the prices were very competitive i was very surprised."}
{"text":"Getting healthy after a swim! I'm amazed at the robust menu this place has. And they open till 9pm! Great service and good food. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Huge menu to choose from with a lot of variety. 
My least favorite thing about this place is how everything has a meat alternative. I'd rather just not have that in there at all and I'd enjoy the dish more. I ordered teriyaki veggies and it came with some odd meat replacement stuff. It just seemed unnecessary and unappealing. Overall, the quality of the food is just alright, their rice seemed like that 10 minute microwaved rice. 
Also it was sooo quiet in here, no music or anything, just a small quiet place which made it a little awkward. 
I will say their chocolate cake was amazing though!"}
{"text":"This vegan restaurant appeals to omnivores and vegans alike. I ate a wonderful meal there with my husband (potato chowder, chick'un parm, spicy curry, & lemon cheesecake) and we were both duly impressed. The owner has a wonderful attitude and sense of humour. I enjoyed a meal with 3 food groups covered! First time in years I have so enjoyed a meal out with my husband where neither of us felt like we were compromising. There were families with young children eating there too- it's a homey place without pretensions. We went ahead and pre-ordered a thanksgiving 'turkey', gravy and a whole lemon cheesecake. They have a thanksgiving dinner being served there as well, all weekend."}
