{"text":"Just another Ma and Pa diner. Eggs and hash browns were good. I thought it was similar to what you would get at Perkins. I would go back for sure. Cost is reasonable."}
{"text":"I hate to kick somebody when they're down, but if this restaurant was a person, I'd suggest a blindfold and a cigarette. This place is down and out and dingy. I stopped here when driving across town this am. Two other customers left and I was the lone customer.  I had the gyro panhandle, which was actually ok, lots of mushrooms, onions, well cooked, just hardly any gyro. I asked for cream for my coffee and the server gave me some 2% milk in a tiny juice glass. As I ate my breakfast alone, the family that owns the place sat in the booth next to me speaking some Eastern European language while \"Careless Whisper\" played in the background. It was so depressing. I can't go back."}
{"text":"Had the gyro special the only special thing about it was that the meat tasted old otherwise no flavor at all.   We ordered an  app.  the onion rings were not as good as Culvers they were actually pretty tasteless also. We won't go back!"}
{"text":"GROSEST PLACE EVER!!!  PLEASE Do not eat here!!!  Bad food, bad service, bad atmosphere.  The cooks smoke in the kitchen then go and cook your food without washing their hands. Too funny also that \"Erin\" who gave the 5 star review is a waitress there and she is probably the one who is the loudest.  If you enjoy burnt bacon, cold toast, and overdone eggs then this is the place to be.  Oh yeah...don't get me started on the salad bar.  Go anywhere else in madison or just as the name implies, you will leave MAD at that DINER!!!"}
{"text":"About as mediocre as you'd expect from a place like this. Greasy, unspectacular food. Our waitress was fine, and the food was very average. The homemade chicken noodle soup was terrible, and the french fries were of a very low quality. My chicken wrap was fine.  Everyone else seemed to be equally underwhelmed.

The whole interior could use some love and is very outdated. Also, the first thing we saw upon entering the parking lot was two of the cooks smoking. Not such a good first impression, and it almost made us leave.

The food was edible and cheap, so if that's what you are looking for, go for it. Otherwise, it's very similar to any other cheap greasy diner and a notch or two below what you'd get at Perkin's."}
{"text":"This place is destined to last about as long as all the preceding restaurants in this location. There were more waitresses than diners and their very loud conversation dominated the room. The food was lukewarm and bland, at least it was cheap. One and done...won't be going back. It's a shame; this neighborhood needs a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there this morning with my boyfriend for breakfast, it just opened so we thought we'd give it a try instead of going to Ihop. We ordered orange juice and it was so watered down, neither of us finished it we drank or water instead.The items on the breakfast menu didn't look appealing so we decided to go with the bacon burger, a side of fries and the soup of the day.. The only plus side to the soup was that it was hot. It had no taste what so ever, I love a good soup so I was kind of disappointed. The burger was decent, nothing to special and the fries looked like they came out of a bag from Woodmans down the st. Wasn't a fan of the waitress, and like the other review stated they were kind of loud. When I went to pay the bill the older lady at the front seemed confused and was just really lacking customer service. We decided we probably won't be back. It wasn't terrible but at the same time there is nothing that we want to go back and try.
