{"text":"This by far is the best Thai we have had in the US. Being halal was an huge plus. 

Service was good and the food was served hot and fresh."}
{"text":"The food was satisfying but not impressive. The service was slow and inattentive.


Edited to add: 
Leftovers the next evening was delicious. I don't know if it was because it was halal but the food held really well. The veggies stayed crisp and the sauce light. Pretty good but the service was still a little inattentive last night. The host/waiter was on their phone."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant I would recommend it for people who like exploring new foods.
The service was as well incredible"}
{"text":"The best and fresh Thai food in Vegas. Must try the salad, soup and the red curry here. This is real Thai food. And very reasonable prices ..!"}
{"text":"I am an out of town dad with my daughter at a soccer tournament. This is a strip mall location and has no liquor license but the food was exceptional and the service was terrific. I would never have found it without yelp and I am glad I did."}
{"text":"With many things in life our perception is colored by our first experience. 
In my case I tend to compare all Thai restaurants with Keo's in Hawaii which is the first Thai food I had ever tried. Since moving to Las Vegas I've been searching for that same flavor. I've finally found it in this restaurant. Although no as elegant decor-wise, the service was really outstanding.
Personable and friendly staff helped to make a delicious meal even better. There is no pork on this menu either.
On the 1-5 scale, for me a 2 was just the right amount of heat. The flavors blended perfectly together and the price was more than reasonable. This is my new favorite Thai restaurant. I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"It really nice testy food. And service is good."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Almost everything I have tried has been excellent. My favorites are coconut soup, drunk noodle (different name on menu), kung pao, all curries, papaya salad. A must stop if you are visiting Vegas. A few miles west from the north end of strip but worth the drive."}
{"text":"tired of burgers and kabobs ? Go there even if you dont have to eat halal food ! portions are great, service is great and the food is delicious !"}
{"text":"This place is beyond bad.  Take my word for it now and just move on to the next listing on yelp.  Plenty of good Thai places in Vegas. 

We called ahead to ensure there wouldn't be a wait because we had a large party and also needed to make a flight so really didn't want to be delayed.  They said \"come on in, plenty of space!\"  Well now I know why. 

Ambience:  dirty, old and crusty, and ghetto.  And no antiquate AC! Are you kiddin me? This is Vegas, in the summer!   
Service:  horrible, slow, rude.  They are slow but they won't admit it. That's the problem here, we are in a hurry to catch a flight, but we had more than an hour so we figured that's plenty. Wrong. They took our order, and said no problem. Waited 30 minutes before we got water. And kept assuring us that it will be fine, food's coming. 50 minutes in... Hmm... Now they finally come and tell us that they don't think they can help us meet our flight time.   Wtf? 

Thanks a lot, aholes.  TL:DR: stay away."}
{"text":"Had a large group and the staff accommodated us OK.  They were friendly but not very attentive. Food very good.  We ordered a bunch of stuff off the menu.  Chicken and beef were very tender.  Bummed the green tea ice cream was sold out.  Spice level pretty good."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Thailand, I am familiar with Thai food.  The Som Tam (papaya salad) was the best I have ever had - no kidding! The Pad Kee Mao with tofu was also delicious. The service was quick and the owner is extremely friendly.  If I am in Vegas again, I will certainly be making a return trip to Sakina."}
{"text":"Best food I had in las Vegas. Food is great and not pricy. More over restrooms are super clean. Owner is really kind"}
{"text":"Decor may be simple but the food and staff is the recipe for success! Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai are amazing! Janet is amazing and the owner Sakina was sweet! Will be back as much as possible! BTW Wi-Fi is available!"}
{"text":"This is an overdue review. This place has good thai food and great service. We enjoyed our trip and always go back when we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"I loved this place, all the workers were so nice and funny, they give you complimentary appetizers and the food was very good.  Highly recommend it. Also it is halal.  Only thing is at times it was a little slow rolling but the hospitality made up for it."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars, except the service at first wasn't the best. It took about 10 min before the waitress came to the table to say hi or even take our drink order. Aside from that, the food came out quickly and deliciously.  We ordered several different plates so we could sample everything.  Got the tom kha kai (level 3 spice) it was amazing. Next time i will have to try a level 5. The spicy basil fried rice was delicious as well as the yellow curry. Will definitely be back soon especially since its right up the street from my house. Glad i found this on yelp!!!"}
{"text":"Best thai food in town. Freshly cooked.  This is not the first time here. Try chicken satay, tum yum soup, beef jerky. Great food."}
{"text":"One of the very few Halal restaurants in Las Vegas that we found via Yelp. To our surprise, the food was really delicious. We had the basil fried rice, spicy catfish and broccoli stir fried. Superb!"}
{"text":"Went back for lunch, had the Panag Curry combo (shrimp, chicken, beef) spice level 1, absolutely delicious!
Also had the Roti bread, well worth the extra cost, DELICIOUS with the curry, I could eat it all day.
The curry has a great depth of flavor. The shrimp marinated in the curry is SOOOO good.
I love this place."}
{"text":"Sakina Thai had great Tom Kha Ga and Chin Hum with beef. Services was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"Love this little place! Love the chicken satay!! Also the milk tea!! Plus, it's HALAL!!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a great meal come here but if your in a rush don't waste your time . Yellow chicken curry & cucumber salad was amazing I'm very happy. All the food tasted fresh I will come back. However they should look into hiring quicker servers"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute must visit. I tried half of the appetizers on their menu and they were just amazing.....try out both their beef appetizers. For main entree every dish we ordered was tasty and freshly prepared.
For desert we tried mango with sticky rice and ice cream with fried banana and loved it so much we went again next day just for desserts. I will definitely be going there during my next visit to Vegas......"}
{"text":"i remembered when this restaurant was called Mega Ramen, until they changed hands which is now the name of this restaurant.  I came to check out this place and see if it was any good.  I ordered the Thai Ice Tea, Chicken Pad-Thai and Satay.  The two dishes were good and tasty, I enjoyed it.  This place is very clean and quiet.  The staff was attentive, I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Visiting town and I came across this little gem. I'm from the San Francisco bay area where we have great thai food. My expectations were very high and Sakina Thai definitely met up to those expectations.

Me and my wife ordered:
Satay Chicken - 5/5
Pad Ze Ew - 5/5
Basil Fried Rice - 5/5
Orange Chicken - 5/5
Mongolian Beef - 3/5

Yes 2 people ordered all that food. The Basil fried rice is a must here! Mongolian Beef was a little overcooked and dry but I still gave this place 5 stars because the owner and chef Sakina is super sweet. My only word of advice is to check water levels. The misses water glass was empty for a long time before waitress refilled it.

I have a stomach cramp from all the food I ate but it's a happy cramp. Go to Sakina; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"While I was in Vegas for business last week, I stop by here twice. That's how much I enjoyed the food. I love Pa-Thai noddles, so I ordered (both times) the combo which has shrimp,beef,& chicken. Great both times. They give out big portions so 1 dish is more then enough for 2 with a side of steam rice. It was all good!!.. Except for an annoying customer my 1st visit who to the liberty to sit with 2 young women (they didn't ask him 2) and just started talking nonsense.. Other then that decent price and good service. I recommend."}
{"text":"This business has actually changed its owner. It no longer serves Halal or Thai food. The curtain store this Pho Vegas"}
{"text":"I love the chicken curry here. It's so yummy. I'm not big on spicy but I make the sacrifice every time. It's so worth it. The waiter here is very friendly. The best part is its halal."}
{"text":"It's very nice mom and pop resturant where I believe the whole family is doing something. Nicest thing about this Resturant is taste, it is not commercial. Somehow all the dishes have their own authentic taste. It could be that's the way it's made in Thai homes. Loved it and will be back again."}
{"text":"I usually make point too try someplace new every week. Sakina was one had on bookmarked. My first impression was very interesting feel too it. I never been too whatever the place was before but walking in could tell that definitely something different. It pretty decent size compare too the front entrance thinking too myself this place is tiny. The waiter she was fabulous greeted me warm welcome and since lunch not very packed she like pick anywhere too sit. The menu is fairly simple with most staple Thai dishes find at most other Thai restaurants. I wanted too try couple things so started with the gyoza but this one was all vegetables no pork in the filling. Interesting. The filling definitely not as hearty and maybe use too gyoza traditional sense only way with pork felt like filled with air. The dipping sauce was nice. The way they steamed then seared the gyoza was on point. Just not that much fan of the filling but think great option if vegan. My entree went with the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. Sakina spicy rating they go only from 1-5. So being first time not sure played it safe went with 2. I wish went higher because 2 felt like bland and thinking Spicy Basil Friend Rice no kick factor. I know next time go higher and for all spicy fans not sure where 5 is compare too other Thai restaurants go 1-10. I enjoyed the mixture of vegetables in the fried rice, the sauce that fried rice cooked in (my own fault should have went 3 or 4) solid, and fried rice could eat everyday. I plan on coming back trying more dishes. Overall honest nothing that can rave about or compare too my favorites Archi or Pan Asian. I only had two dishes. For sure plan on going back and trying more dishes but till then just think good Thai food."}
{"text":"One word.. Excellent!!!! Everything freshly prepared, authentic, and very tasty! One of the absolute best Thai food I've had here in the US and it's Halal which makes it even better :) this is truly a don't miss restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Good selection of Tai food, quick service. Our good was great. On the spicy level 1-5 I typically order a 3, this place I would probably suggest a 2"}
{"text":"On our recent trip to vegas my husband and I wanted to try out something new. I came across this place with such pleasant reviews and luckily for us it served halal meat! 
So my husband and I went for dinner here. We ordered their famous spicy basil fried rice because of the numerous good reviews I read about them. And we were so not disappointed. Loved them! Their tom yum soup was good. Not great. And the thai beef was okay too."}
{"text":"Had the best meal here we've had in ages! Everything we ordered just tasted delicious! And we all are picky people to please.

Ordered: 

Chicken satay - delicious peanut sauce to dip in!!

Thai iced tea - always tasty

Chicken basil fried rice - awesome! Highly recommend. 

Panang beef curry - very tasty and flavorful. Creamy and compliments the white rice well.

Pad kee mao with chicken - like drunken noodles - great flavor

Orange chicken - I got this bc I loveeee sesame chicken and this is the closest Thai version of that. It was realllly good. 

I'm well versed in spicy dishes as a desi and the waitress, super friendly and nice staff btw, gave us a spice scale of 1-5. We picked 3 for everything and found it spicier than we anticipated so might go for a 2 next time. 

Overall, will definitely be going again! Great staff, fast service, awesome food. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall but the food is so good. Their Thai food scale is from 1 - 5 so just be careful when ordering. Their chicken satay was good.
 We loved their Kung Pao and Chicken Panang. Need to come back again to try their other dishes on the menu. 
I am all for supporting such restaurants that might not have a big name but they serve excellent food."}
{"text":"This new Thai restaurant replaced the Mega Ramen restaurant that was there before, and I do believe this is an improvement!  The inside is much more open and finely decorated.  The service was experienced, nice, and attentive.  The server obviously cared what I thought about the food, which is always a good sign.  I ordered the fried calamari and the Pad Ga Pow (might be spelled differently on the menu) with beef.  Interestingly enough they do not serve pork here!  

The calamari was quite nice.  It came with about half tempura squid and half tempura veggies.  If you can forgive the veggies and don't mind eating a little healthier, I would recommend this dish.  The batter was very, very light perhaps one of the lightest I have had, but had enough flavor to keep it interesting.  They use the typical Thai style sweet and sour sauce, clear and pinkish red in color, not too sweet, and with light tasting chili flakes.  

The Ga Pow was very unique and surprising.  I haven't had this dish prepared in this style before.  The waitress informed me that it is more of a Southern style Thai restaurant.  The meat was very lean and finely minced.  At first I thought it was hamburger by the look, but I was definitely mistaken when I tasted it.  It was very light and almost fluffy.  No feeling of extra grease or fat.  The veggies (onions, bell peppers, etc) were well prepared and fresh tasting.  On top of jasmine rice, it was a very light version of the dish.  One thing to note here is that this place is quite a bit hotter than most Thai restaurants.  The waitress warned me that my 3/5 was VERY hot.  The spice level did not disappoint, and I quite enjoyed the heat level balanced with the lighter flavors.  The dish was not sweet at all, which deviates from the typical version of this dish you find in Vegas.  Very light on the palate and the stomach.  The one criticism I might have is that it also wasn't very complex (no or very little basil, mint, etc), but as simple as the flavors were they worked very well.  

I am very curious about the style of this Thai cooking.  I most certainly will be back to try some of the other dishes like the curries and noodle dishes.  Their motto is no sweetness, and I like that in a Thai restaurant.  Sakina is a fantastic and unique addition to the Thai food scene in Las Vegas, and in my opinion a must try for Thai food lovers!"}
{"text":"This is as authentic as gets!! Amazing authentic food with excellent flavor! I stayed in Vegas for almost 6 nights and we ate at this spot 4 times. I was skeptical at first due to their outdated decor (which they are planning to change), but as soon as i tried their chicken wings, I was sold!! I tried their chicken wings, both beef appetizers, 3 chicken entrees (I can not recall their names), 3 beef entrees including beef mongolian which was amazingggg, pad thai (best I ever had) and mega fried rice and basil fried rice which were some of the best rice entrees I've ever had and finally mango sticky rice and roti dessert!

This place has only been open for about 2 months and it's the most authentic thai cuisine I've ever tried. The chef has over 20 years of experience working in a sushi kitchen and she does an amazing job combining both her japanese and thai background!!

Can not wait to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem
Love all their dishes and prices."}
{"text":"Great presentation on food, but really small portions for the price and Thai Food.  Spicy Basil Fried rice had a lot of flavor but some of the rice was not cooked all the way. Ordered the Garlic Chicken. Really good, but an extremely small portion on a really small plate. Not enough to share, unless you order several dishes to sample and eat family style."}
{"text":"Food is great here. We had the chicken satay skewers. Chicken was juicy and tasty.

Basil fried rice - so good that you don't need anything to complement it. If you like spicy then this is the best to go dish by itself.

Beef with basil - excellent dish with steamed rice which they serve complimentary. 

Customer service is also a 5 star!!

Thank you Sakina for your great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I heard about this Halal Thai Restaurant from a gd friend of mine Jihan.  We were there last weekend for lunch. Mum had the best time of her life eating halal dishes. Finally, halal thai food. We were very happy with the taste,  the ambience,  the server Mariam & Chef Sakina. Alhamdullilah. Thank you. We will be back soon. Check out the photos I posted on yelp. Enjoy. :-)"}
{"text":"Great food!  We were visiting from chicago and decided to try this place.  you can't get halal thai just anywhere and so I was excited to try this place. We tried satay chicken and it was good.  Restaurant needs some updating but Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and not too expensive. Not spicy at all but you can order it as spicy as you would like."}
{"text":"Red curry FTW! Chicken satay FTW! Love this Thai place. First off it's halal, so everything is up for grabs. Secondly it's authentic Thai, not some Thai place with a random dude off the street. The appetizer I got was a chicken satay with peanut butter sauce. Just mind blowing; a must try also you may not want to share! The main course was red curry chicken extra spicy! The spicy was perfect to my taste as I love everything spicy. The bamboo shoots in the curry were soft but crunchy, perfectly well done. The chicken absorbed all of the curry flavor. The rice was just average steam rice. The only reason it's not a 5 star review is because service was spotty at times but order lots of food so you don't have to worry about the service. New favorite place!"}
{"text":"Tho not much on decor the food was very good and the service excellent.  Spicy basil fried rice was very good!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and beautiful food. Thanks for making our evening special. Clean, quiet and I loved the warmth exuded by the staff. Wish I could move to Vegas just to eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Honestly, best damn Thai place I have ever had!!! Amazing service and super awesome food!!! The owner personally came out to make sure out food was perfect! 

At another table someone had mentioned the food was spicy even after requesting non-spicy and I heard the waitress offering to take the plate back and redo. 

We went on a Tuesday night having yelped it and thought the portions would be small but for a family of 4 adults it was more than enough. I would literally cross the California/Nevada border just to go get some of this damn great flavorful food!

Great presentation, clean, nothing bad to say! Can't say roundhouse good things. Affordable! $8.95 per a la cart menu. $49 for family of 4"}
{"text":"it is a small place but very traditional style, the food is awesome, i love their teriyaki sauce. my sister loves to come and eat chicken soup. appetizers are always a must! the service is excellent and always taking care of how are we doing. you can have a great dinner with some friends in here and finish with a delicious dessert."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great people. Also halal options. Excellent thai food. If you are in Vegas  good place to eat."}
{"text":"Besides the plus this place is Halal and has no pork products ts on the menu..the food is EXCELLENT. Best Pad Thai I've ever had. I even ordered it with ground beef which is rare for me. They don't just use ground beef, they use high quality steak and ground it up IN- House with the halal beef. Even the noodles they use for the pad thai were a bit thinner than the traditional rice noodles. Flavors were decedent and perfectly measured. I ordered a 3 out of 5 for spice. Little too high for me so if you like it hot they can accommate. We came here because of the halal factor but I will be spreading the word to friends that don't even care about that. this place kills Archies and Pin Kaow. If you happen to  like Indonesia or Bali food, they have that thin crispy bread here Rotoni (I think was the name) that you rarely find. I dipped it in my fiance's curry and it was over the TOP! They are local and made a few service mistakes but kindly fixed em and thanked us genuinely for coming. Well done!  We always hit the grove when we are in LA and go to our fav spot called Banana Leaf...guess what..got our fix here. This is thai on steriods!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I had authentic thai food that was halal. In the east coast, we only find fusion here so this was a pleasant surprise for us. The food was absolutely delicious, I'd recommend the spicy basil fried rice and pad kee mao noodles, they were my favorite from the several things we ordered. For appetizers, the chicken satay was my favorite along with the Tom yum soup. Overall, everything was perfect and the service was really fast too. Our waitresses were also friendly and helped us decide what was best to order. Price is decent as well and the location is very close to the strip."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Why pay the big prices on the Strip when you can dine here for a third of the price and leave happy!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Great service! Would totally recommend this place to anyone who likes to try different cuisines. The tomyum soup... Coconut flavor was yum..I was kinda skeptical about trying it at first but then since the owner really recommended it i gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. Chicken satay and garlic pepper chicken , pad kee mao were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. We are from New Jersey and  tried their food. It was a very satisfying experience. Loved it. Everything from Tom Yam soup to Basil Chicken and Mongolian Beef were to die for. Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Place wasn't too busy. Server was very prompt. Took our orders for pad Thai. The spice scale was only from 1 to 5 which I thought was strange. 

The waiter got us water but it had no ice in it and wasn't particularly cold. Thought it was a bit weird, would want my tap water a little colder than room temperature. 

I got my beef pad Thai and I only did 2 out of 5 spices but I was disappointed as I had no spice whatsoever. And there wasn't much spice to put into the food either as the spice containers on the table were pretty empty. 

Server didn't come back much after we got our food. The food was pretty bland. The peanuts overpowered much of the meal. Beef was okay, the noodles was pretty mushy and lacked flavor. If you wanted to carbo load, it would be great but lacked flavor. I felt bloated after eating the meal, needed to take a nap. 

The place has gotten great reviews before so there must be better dishes. I'd probably say to avoid the pad Thai and maybe bring your own ice cubes."}
{"text":"A very low end spot certainly by decor.   But the food was fairly tasty.   Chicken satay was crispy but not dry. The basil chicken was good.   Ground up and tasty.   A little salty but good mine the less.  

So not a bad spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here two dinners in a row. It's very delicious food. The staff was very friendly. The basil fried rice was very yummy. We ordered fried banana with icecream for desert. It was awesome!!! Great place. Will definitely come again next time we're in Vegas :)."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch one day as we were feeling the itch for Thai food and searched for the closest place. 

Service was prompt and friendly. I ordered a Thai iced tea and it was standard. Our waters came with no ice in them which was a little strange. 

Shrimp pad thai was very mediocre. Maybe I caught them on and off day but the noodles were super mushy and the plate came with the hugest mound of bean sprouts. My plate was split 1/2 pad thai noodles, 1/4 bean sprouts, and 1/4 crushed peanuts. The garnish proportion was way off and there were no limes! 

I also asked for a 3 out of 5 spiciness because I always tell myself that I can add some heat rather than having my tongue burn off and just suffer through it because there was no way to take away the heat. But the container for hot stuffs were basically empty. It also worried me that they sit out for too long without anyone checking them for their levels and/or cleanliness. 

Again, maybe it was an off day, and we only had pad thai, but it was a disappointing dish--mushy, bland, and overpowered by sprouts and crushed peanuts. I hope that other dishes are much better."}
{"text":"They changed up their pad Thai. And forgot my peanuts I'm not sure what's going on with them. 

Their Thai tea is great tho!!"}
{"text":"This is another low rent, mom and pop type restaurant that we frequented on this trip.  Shortly after settling in I managed to spill an entire glass of water all over both the table and my wife.   After being relocated to another table, she cuffed my right hand to the side of my chair.  We then shared orders of rad nah (flat noodles with chicken) and pad ka pow (spicy chicken with basil),    Both dishes were pretty authentic, fresh and very satisfying. 

A 3.5 rating would be more appropriate."}
{"text":"For the price, food is 5 star. Basil fried rice, mint chilli, and fried tofu was really good. Inexperienced server who doesnt care abiut his job knocks down a star."}
{"text":"Hell yes!  We loved our dinners and look forward to eating here often in the future.  Glad the decor isn't bleach boring strip mall, and although it's lacking much style, it's comfortable enough to sit with friends and chat the night away.  Friendly service.  Large portions, great for sharing and mixing.

Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Seafood Combo -- Our favorite!  We stayed safe with Spice Level 1 after overhearing another table complain they ordered too hot.  Glad we scaled back; the 1 was perfect.  A little tingle but no pain, and tons of flavor with the herbs and crunchy veg.  Good seafood mix, giant muscles and grilled shrimp, so-so squid.

Yakisoba, Meat Combo -- Pleasantly sweet noodles with lots of veg and meat.  Skip the plain (but moist) thin strips of beef and chicken, just go all shrimp, baby.  I wish there was more cabbage.  (Good line for my tombstone, gotta remember that one.)

Crispy Catfish Salad -- Bizarre at first, since the fish is minced super fine, then fried to an indiscernible crisp ... so we just saw a blanket of brown crunchies and were confused where the \"fish\" went.  But after the lovely server explained it's a different style, we mixed it in with a green apple salad and our faces basically exploded with tart, sweet, spicy crunch.  In fact, we kept spooning the mixture over everything else we ate, because it had a crunch that could not be stopped.  I wouldn't be satisfied with just this plate for dinner, but it's an excellent sharing dish for punching up everything else.

Crab Rangoon -- Unlike any I've had, rolled long and thin in spring roll wrappers.

I'm diggin how this place comes at my usual orders with a different angle.  I also appreciate the Chinese options on the menu, since our group doesn't all love Thai, so everyone leaves happy and stuffed.

Also in love with their roti, since I haven't found roti this good since Flat Top Grille in Chicago.  Shame it's $2.50 each, but I will order saucy things just to have something to dip in these slices of heaven.

If you're a texture-based eater like me, this place is a playground.  :-)

Wish List: Would love to see fountain soda instead of cans."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Found it by accident and although the decor is nothing fancy, the food made up for it.  Satay chicken - fresh with tasty peanut sauce.  Yellow curry chicken - sweet and spicy.  Tom ka gai soup - yummy!  We got medium spicy and it was just right.  We will come back !"}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas on vacation, and I've never had Thai cuisine, don't know why...I just never did, so when my uncle recommended this place, I was eager because I LOVE trying different cuisines from different parts of the world. 
 Not only did they offer Thai, but they also offered Chinese and Japanese. I will say, the Japanese options are very limited. The wait time of the restaurant was awesome! Once we decided what to order, the food was at the table in 5 minutes max. It tasted like authentic Asian cuisine, and was incredibly flavorful and delicious! We ate family style but I'm not sure if they offer individual platters. Our server was incredibly polite and informative. I enjoyed the experience. I might move to Vegas just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby.

Had this spot bookmarked for a while now and decided to put it on \"checked\" list.

Locates on the busy Sahara Ave, just off of Arville, next to 7-11.  This place has prime location. Or so you would think. We were the only table for about an hour or so. Interior is quite roomy. Plenty seating, and enough room for large parties of maybe 30-40 guests. Thai decor and food pictures displayed on wall. Sakina is only 2 years old. The previous restaurant, in its spot, was also a thai restaurant. Previous owner failed I guess. Janet, the owner, server, waitress, and host, is a very kind and inviting person. She made our experience a very warm one. So far her clientele is based off of a peer to peer experience, no advertising. So more local regulars as is Kinnaree Thai, and Komol Restaurant. 

What ordered:
Pork larb
Chicken green curry
Papaya salad
Chicken pa kapow

Their heat scale is based on a 1-5 hotness here, 5 being their hottest. Everything was brought out at the same time as requested. Janet kept our waters filled and constantly checked on us, adding conversations here and there. 
The food.... Pork larb was amazing. Considered a salad dish, my wife and i always eat this as a main dish. It has a great mix of tangy and sweet with a hint of spicy. The papaya salad was too sweet for our liking. But then again, we always get it Lao style where they use crab paste and a bit more fish sauce. Considering we were in a thai restaurant, we'd try it authentic. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just a little sweeter than what we're used too. The green curry was also flavorful. I'm used to a thicker sauce than the one served. It was a bit runny, but the flavor was good. White meat was used in this dish. I did not get to try the noodle dish my wife got, but she gave it a 7 on a 1-10 scale. 

Overall this is a good go to spot for thai food. If you are in the vicinity of 5 miles, look forward to delivery in the future. Janet will be organizing with some people in order to get it on track. Worth the stop if your in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Las Vegas for 4 days and we discovered Sakina Thai Cousine on our second day there. We liked it so much that we ate there everyday for the rest of our stay. We tried different kinds of curries, tom yum soup, fish cakes, house salad, spring roll and stir fry. We loved it all and already miss this place! It's also very clean and has a place to offer the most delicious food. The staff is very friendly and greets everyone with \"Salamu Alaykum\"! I wish they would open a franchise in my town"}
{"text":"Take it or leave it, just ok food and ok service, nothing special.  I prefer weera down the street.. better service, foos and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worth coming to Vegas for ! Enough said ..
Chicken satay- 5 pieces with a amazing peanut Sauce and cucumber salad
Basil fried rice with chicken - matches expectations set by other reviewers
Pad phing king with beef- succulent soft beef with beans

{"text":"the food is bomb,
if your looking for good hala food in lv, this is the place absoluyely"}
{"text":"Great food and service!!!
The service was absolutely the best. Our waitress was very personable, warm and welcoming.  Our food was perfect.
