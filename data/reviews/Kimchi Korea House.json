{"text":"Excellent food. I Lone wolfed this place at lunch hour and tried the bulgogi bibimbap. Food came in a jiff, was delicious, plus I got all these side dishes, including a bowl of miso soup. I think they may have the best side dishes of any Korean place I've been too, but maybe I'm just a sucker for"}
{"text":"Had the stir fry squid and Bossam. Super delicious!!! Squid usually gets overcooked at lots of restaurants but it was quite soft. Bossam comes with a good amount of meat. Service was great - even though sometimes you might have to wave at them to get their attention when it gets busy. Very clean, fast, authentic, and would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Eat here often and posted a previous review on another site - suggesting the size of each glass of wine was inconsistent. Spoke to management and every glass after that was consistent.  Great food and service.  Pork bone soup is a 5 out of 5 - and the appetizers before the meal are delicious.  Great value."}
{"text":"The staff are super friendly. I was taken by surprise on the amazing service and the tasty bulgogi. I will be coming back here on the regular."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and while they're more expensive than some other korean places, I thought the food was decent enough.   Unfortunately, I had an extremely unpleasant and humiliating experience with the lady manager last week. I brought my friends here last Saturday for a quick lunch and everything went fine until it was time to pay the bill.We weren't aware that there was a $15 minimum to use the debit machine (all of us hadn't brought cash) so we were extremely grateful that they made an exception for us. Our actual server was actually very sweet and came to check on us very often, but our experience with the manager caused us to never want to visit again.   Once we paid our bills, the lady manager came over with a receipt demanding to know whose it was, saying one of us hadn't left enough tips. Thinking it was me, I was immediately sorry and thought I had made a mistake with the machine because I was pretty sure I had left a good tip. I fumbled in my wallet for all the change I had and handed to her. She had the audacity to count it in front of me and tell me that it wasn't enough.  I double checked my receipt, and it turns out I had already paid my tip! It was actually my friend's receipt and she handed me back my change and proceeded to confront my friend. At this point I was noticeably angry and the manager kept on asking why I was upset because I had paid my tip properly. I explained to her I was upset because she had confronted us in such a rude way and that it felt like we were being extorted for money. She didn't understand and proceeded to give me a long lecture about how customers never pay proper tips at Korean restaurants (but really was it worth losing 3 customers over one of two dollars??). While I empathize with the struggles of restaurant workers, I thought how she treated us was extremely rude, unprofessional, and condescending.  Don't go to Kimchi Korea House because if you accidentally forget to leave a tip you're going to be treated like a criminal."}
{"text":"If you like spicy Korean pork bone soup this is the place to go, but for some reason lots of servers standing there yet women servers are the worst compared to the guys, especially for takeout.   Maybe they're only like that to other women or to their own race?  I'm not sure but better to get a guy to serve you so you enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"This is the worst Korean restaurant I have ever been to. The food was okay, but the portions were so tiny for the price that you pay. I've been to many other Korean restaurants that offer the same menu items for a much cheaper price and for much better quality. The worst thing about this restaurant is that I was forced to tip even though I was not satisfied with my meal. I had already paid my bill and the manager or someone higher up came up to me and forced me to tip an amount that she wanted. That was completely unacceptable. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this place just has such bad service that I had to write about it.   The food is okay, a bit pricey but the service is terrible! It was fine at first but when it was time to pay, the owner walked over, counting our money and then brought over two additional servers to have them count our money again. She then started to yell, lecture, and embarrass us for leaving below a 15% tip saying how the servers are students and they're making below minimum wage. However, my friends and I are also students and according to the law we are not required to leave a tip if we don't want to. The fact that she blew up on us in front of everyone else and then expected us to give more tips is a joke. Unprofessional! Bad service! Never returning again. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"A good looking casual restaurant, comfortable, and the service was fantastic! We ordered 2 items, an extra spicy fish soup (which arrived bland and nonspicy) and a japchae with beef (kimchi house has just made this my new favorite dish). So one big hit, one miss. But the service was great, side dishes were tasty (eg real kimchee instead of coleslaw with pepper). so I'll still give it 4 stars. My friend bought an extra side dish to enjoy at home later. It's pricier than the standard Korean restaurant - my dish was $13.95 instead of the usual $8.95) but the flavor is worth it. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst Korean restaurants in Toronto. The food and service is lack lustre, sub par, and expensive (probably the worst combination). I tried the Ssamjunsik, Gam Ja Tang, and Seafood Pancake the last time I went there. I will never go back again. Seafood pancake was good. That was it. The gam ja tang is average for Toronto but the Ssamjunsik is horrendous. Portion was small - they give you probably 3 pieces of lettuce leaves and the bowls were small. If you ask for extra lettuce be prepared to pay. Bon chon too, you can barely ask for more. As for taste of the Ssamjunsik, it was below average at best. Go to any other Toronto restaurants and you will have Ssamjunsik for half the price with double the amount and quadruple the taste. Try makkal chon for example. The Ssamjunsik here is the worst I've ever tried compared to others in Toronto, LA, or Korea."}
{"text":"Food is great! I had bulgogi bibimbap and takoyaki. Takoyaki was the bomb ! I had them in other places but this one was the best. Although, a little pricey compared to other korean resto. But can't complain! Their food is awesome!   Tried their pork bone soup as well. Delish! I  am so gonna go back for it."}
{"text":"One of the best pork bone soup in downtown Toronto. Unlike most places, the soup here is indeed spicy and flavourful. Love it. I can see that it might be even too spicy for those that prefer a plain, mild broth. While it charges a little bit more than other restaurants, you get a bigger serving portion here :)"}
{"text":"Food is not as equivalent as Ka Chi, and the waiter's attitude is way worse."}
{"text":"My friend took me here during the winter break after exams. I have to say that this place had the best bibimbap that I've ever had. They service was also very friendly. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We ordered Pork bone soup and Kimchi Pancake. The pork bones is fine, bones have lots of meat on it but only one piece of potato in the soup.. but I really like the kimchi pancake, a little bit crispy, very nice.  We went there at around 6:30pm on Monday, the place is already full. Waitress is nice but too busy to  take care of us - waited for a long time to pay the bill."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh! And really tasty. I had a bulgogi tempura bento and everything was so yummy. My son had shrimp bibimbap. We appreciated the variety of choices for bibimbap - not just beef. Our neighbours had Kalbi that looked yummy too. And the panchan they brought out before the meal was very..,.fresh and yummy too! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here! The service is great and friendly, and the side dishes tend to change a lot! Good bibimbap and porkbone soup. I'd love to try out everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was bland, aided only by soy sauce. The soy sauce was watery and had a strong chemical taste, almost like a cough syrup!  The salads' quantities were minimal, but they were Ok. The soup had a funny flavor, I could not tell what. The chicken was dry and not freshly cooked, it had a stale edge to it.   The server was extremely rude, no smile, no thank you, almost a bully with a condescending attitude."}
{"text":"I came on the night of Boxing Day. The hostess at the front was horrible. She was extremely rude and seriously provided the worst service on earth. She was so rude that customers actually left because of her. We almost left because of her. She almost ruined the whole experience. The waitress was a lot better and actually looked like she didn't want to murder us. The food was decent. I got bibimbap, a Korean pork pancake and chicken yaki udon. I would give this place 5 stars but that horrible hostess lowered it by 2 stars."}
{"text":"I had to open a yelp account just to post this review. This place is top notch, absolutely amazing in every way. Food/Service/Ambiance/Cleanliness all 100% We eat a lot of Korean (our favorite cuisine) and this place is definitely the BEST.   Me and my husband come all the way from Miami and every time we are in town to see in-laws we make sure to go this place at least 3 times! From the first time we came in the owner welcomed us and treated us like family with shots and extras and most importantly a warm and welcoming attitude with superior service. We came back a year later and she remembered us and made sure me and my family (2 toddlers with us) were happy and well taken care of. She anticipated what we needed and got it for us before we could even ask! Beyond impressive and obviously very memorable.   You have some very loyal customers! Thank you for treating us like family and of course making the most flavorful, tasty Korean food in town! We will be back as often as possible :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  We decided to have a quick meal at this place. The waitress came back to us 10 minutes later asking again what we had ordered just now. Food taste okay, but when we paying the bill the same waitress told us we can't use credit card for anything under 15 dollars. So I paid my friend's meal too with credit card. I couldn't believe it when I input the tip amount she told me you have to tip me at least 15%, it's what their manager said. I told her: well I'd like to talk to your manager if he/she set this \"rule\", and also, why are you standing so close to me and starring when I'm going to input my password? What is wrong if I tip 10%?   She said there is no need to call their manager and seemed to be really pissed-off. Then she treated us very rudely by throwing the receipts back to me.   I was really surprised that this waitress behaved so unprofessionally. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"A few of us decided to have Korean food for dinner after a stressful day at work. After deciding not to go too far from where we all live, we have decided to try the Korean restaurant which we always see when we head to work but never end up going in.   The decor is quite nice, but on a hot summer day, the AC wasn't very strong which didn't help when we ordered soup for dinner. Our waiter was quite helpful as he constantly came over to see whether we enjoyed our meal and refilled our water.   The food is quite standard. It's what you can expect from a Korean restaurant. It's nothing that needs introduction. If you have been to a Korean restaurant, expect the same type of food here at the Kimchi Korea House. Being such a large city with so many dining choices to offer, I don't see myself coming here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times already this year - the Korean food is delicious! What I love about the restaurant is how clean it is and the peaceful environment. A gem for university students nearby. A good drop-by for after Eaton shopping too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late solo lunch the other day and very much enjoyed the vegetarian bibimbap.  Service was attentive and friendly, and the food was good value too.  Left with a fully satisfied belly that didn't empty out my wallet.  My love affair with Korean food continues..."}
{"text":"Very average korean restaurant. They provide a wide selection of side dishes with each order. Kimchi is very good !  I ordered the soybean tofu stew. It was slightly on the saltier side. Nothing very special.  Note: they don't accept credit card for bills under 15."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times, and their seafood pancake is THE BOMB ! Highly recommended!! The servers are friendly."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch and we both ordered bento boxes, which we both enjoyed. The appetizers were also good and the tea set was super cute.   Staff is friendly however it does get busy and noisy quickly and because the place itself is a little small to accommodate all these customers, it can get a little crowded at times."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick solo dinner here as it was close to the hotel and looked busy. The overall layout and space could use some updating and a more traditional Korean feel. The kimchi itself was delish, especially the glass noodles, spicy cucumber and the traditional. The pork bibimbap with a fried egg was really good with great flavor. Service was friendly, quick and on point. Overall good find"}
{"text":"This place really needs to get their food together.  The bulgogi was not marinated enough, almost tasteless.  The pork bone soup was shockingly bland with no potato, no bean sprouts.  The worst was the kimchi, it was raw, it  wasn't pickled nearly enough, almost like they cut cabbage and doused it in pepper sauce on the spot.    I don't  mean to be harsh especially since the place is new and still finding their bearings.  But c'mon, if you're going to invest that much money in your decor then get a decent chef who knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"Simply the best bibimbap dish in Toronto.  Crispy rice with lovely tasting veggies and great quality meat.  Service is great and friendly. We drive for an hour to enjoy this great place."}
{"text":"I went here to eat because it is a convenience location and I heard the food is good.  However, I was very disappointed with how they serve the side dishes.  We were a party of four and each of us ordered a main course.  We were given 6 side dishes and the portion was very small.  We asked right away to have one more chap chae and kimchi.  We finished everything of course and would like to have 2 more side dishes.  We were told by the waiter that we couldn't have more.  I then looked around and saw a couple of single customer who were eating their side dishes, each of them were given the same 6 dishes.  So if a single customer sat down and had 6 side dishes then we four should be given 24 side dishes if you did the math.  Of course we were going to ask that many, we just wanted 2 more.  These costs should already been factor into the menu prices.  Plus their food prices aren't cheap compare to other Korean restaurants, they charge an egg for $1.45.  So I gave 1 star for location, 1 star for ok food, but no star for service, price/value and overall experience."}
{"text":"I've always been satisfied with this place but I have to say the last visit was very disappointing.  I like their pork bone soup and side dishes for me their kimchi is quite tasty.  The soup itself is spicy enough unlike other Korean restaurant with milder taste.  However, on the last visit there were 3 of us and they gave us same portion of side dishes as I had gone by myself.  After 2 servings I requested another round but was told maximum 2 servings.  This must have been a new rule because when I went by myself before, the waitress/waiter always asked if I want more side dishes even after 2 servings.  For me it shows a sign of cutting corner and I have a feeling it's starting to follow the same path as The Owl (raising price while cutting corner). Despite that, the food quality and experience overall are usually pleasant as they offer a more comfortable dining environment and more friendly service as comparison with other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here because Sansotei was closed (Feb 14). The restaurant wasn't too busy and we were seated by the window.. the door opening and closing made the corner very cold and chilly. At one point I had to wear my jacket to warm up, the servers not very attentive to it until the end of the meal.  Service was non-existent after the servers took our orders. Not one check-up about how the meal was. Luckily another table seated near us for us to even get the attention of another server to ask for refills.  The food was average, if not a tad bit below it. I've heard this place was good but I cannot see why. I don't think I will be coming back. Payment was also weird: they only accept cash for meals under $15.00, so anything above is paid by card."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, and never been disappointed.  Delicous food, the side dishes you'd expect, and friendly staff.  I recommend the gamajatang (spicy pork bone soup)! So good and very filling."}
{"text":"Kimchi Korea House offers a great atmosphere and great food. Its brand new and an extremely enjoyable eating environment. All of the staff are extremely friendly and nice. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys not only Kimchi, but all Korean food."}
{"text":"This restaurant was really a pleasant surprise.  We were waited on by Michelle, the owner of the restaurant, who was cheerful, friendly, and attentive.  The food we had was excellent; my girlfriend grew up in eastern Russia and knows good Korean food, and she loved it.  The food was flavorful and plentiful, and the kimchi was excellent with a modern twist.  It is impeccably clean - check out the washroom!  And we only paid $15 for lunch for the two of us.  The starter of five different kimchi items (soybean sprouts, radish, chicken, cabbage and green beans) was a fantastic surprise, and the kimchi stew was wonderful.  If we lived in Toronto, we would be back weekly.  Go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Their gamjatang (pork bone soup) is just heavenly, and on the more flavourful, spicier side. Their side dishes are also great too (their pickled cucumbers and their potatoes, especially!) Absolutely love this place.  On the pricier side for Korean food, but what else can you expect, given its convenient location?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday afternoon and had an amazing time! The staff were very friendly and the service in general was great. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and my friend ordered the eel bibimbap and neither of us were disappointed. The waitress for our table even asked us if we wanted any refills for our banchan! I never write Yelp reviews but the staff was so great so I had to! Hopefully you guys enjoy your experience there as well :)"}
{"text":"This is an update from my first visit to Kimchi House where I only gave it 2/5.  I've upgraded to 3 stars because my 2nd visit was a real improvement.  First off, the service was really very good.  We had a quiet yet attentive server that was dealing with the start of a power lunch rush.  Knowing that there are better places to get Kamja Tang (Korea House at 666 Bloor!) I decided to order the Dwen Jan Chigae (Soy bean paste soup with seafood) and was much happier this time around.  Their side dishes are fresh and the soup hit the mark.  I enjoy a really deep funky (the smell...) dwen jan whereas this was on the lighter side but no less enjoyable.    Someone at my table had the LA Kalbi ribs and they looked amazing - next on my list when I'm feeling particularly hungry."}
{"text":"Most Korean restaurants are generous with their side dishes, but not this place. They don't refill so don't even ask and portions are small.   Most Korean restaurants give complimentary Korean tea, but not this place. They charge $1 each. Surprised they didn't charge for tap water.   They forgot one of our orders.   Their kimchee was soooo sweet. Awful.   Overall, overpriced and under serviced."}
{"text":"I was promptly greeted by very pleasant workers. The restaurant is quite spacious with semiprivate seating, which I like. The meal came with appetizers which were a nice surprise. I am not an expert on Korean food so I can't say what it was I ate but it was decent. I ordered the sweet and sour wings which had me licking my fingers- it was so good.  So why do the servicers have to wear short skirts?"}
{"text":"Their hostess is very rude, and has the worst attitude ever My friend and I had to wait for about good 20 minutes by the door without no recognition by the hostess, and she also ignored me three times when I tried to ask her how long the wait is. They won't even let us be seated at an empty booth even though everyone else in the line is all two people (I assumed they were waiting for three or four people for the booth),but in the end they gave us another booth anyway so I did not know why they didn't just give it to us earlier. When we were seated, I complained to another waitress, she apologized but honestly the other hostess have just too much attitude. When we were eating, the waiter kept rushing our meal while we were busy having serious conversation and our food was not even done yet. First of all, their food is not authentic and doesn't even taste that good and it is over priced I only went there because of the traveling convenience Never going there ever again If you really want authentic Korean food, go to Sunrise House by Christie Station OH and this place does not allow you to use debit/credit if it is less than $15 which is total bullshit because they didn't even specify anywhere clearly"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my go-to for korean food downtown. My friends and I stumbled upon it, to be honest but then I had to go back.   So far I've ordered their teriyaki salmon bibimbap, bulgogi bibimbap, and dukbokki (spicy rice cake). I was a fan of all of them. The meat to rice and vegetables was really good for the bibimbap and the spicy rice cake was as spicy as I thought it should be. I like how they have a variety of bibimbap, and not just the original kind with ground beef and egg. The salmon one is definitely my favourite. It's actually what I get every time I go there because I can't get that flavour anywhere else. Also their side dishes were really good too, I could eat those all day.  Of course there was a downside to the amazing food here, which was the service. It wasn't great but it wasn't super bad. They were really nice when you got their attention but also very busy so it was more on the quick service side.  I'd still recommend the place though if you're looking for good quality korean food."}
{"text":"Delicious bibimbaps! My favourite is the bulgogi (beef). Not much variety on the menu but tons of bibimbaps!"}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Thursday night. The restaurant was fairly busy, we were seated immediately. I find the dishes are on the pricier side. The waiters took longer to take our order.  I ordered the Salmon Bibimbap hotstone $10.95 and was asked if I wanted egg $1.45 or cheese $2.95 at extra cost. I declined. My dinner date ordered the Kalbi Rib Soup $11.95, the waiter tried to upside him on the ginseng which would have cost an additional $4.95. He declined too.  The side dishes came after we ordered. They were the typical dishes nothing really stood out. I typically devourer them within 5 mins, however some of the dishes were \"ok\".  Our main dishes came. My Salmon Bibimbap had a decent size piece of salmon, but lacked the vegetables that you would typically get. All it came with was beans sprouts..... My understanding of bibimbap comes with an array of assorted veggies (ex. zucchini, cumcumber, carrots...etc.). Aside from the lack of veggies, the fish was flavourful. The Kalbi Rib Soup was very flavourful, and there was decent size ribs.   The food had the flavour, but lacked fundamental elements of what would make it a Korean dish. After leaving the restaurant we both were super thirsty, probably from the 'extra' flavour that is added.   I would give Kimchi Korea House 2.5/5 stars. Reason is for the high prices, the upselling on an already pricier menu and the lastly on the lack of veggies in the bibimbap.(I would classify it as more of a teriyaki salmon and rice in a hot stone pot dish)."}
{"text":"This was absolutely amazing korean food in Toronto . I recommend people who love the food. The food at kimchi korean house are delicious. The waiter/waitress are very polite when asking them. But i recommed coming in alittle bit early because it tends to get busy around dinner time. But if you want or craving for korean food i highly recommend"}
{"text":"Visited Kimchi for the first time today, and it seems to be a popular lunching spot as the doors were packed with waiting diners.  At the 12-1pm mark, the lineup was reasonable at waits of about 10-15 minutes for pairs or small groups under 4 guests.   The food is what I think you'd expect - $16 bought me a bento box containing - 6 pieces of L.A. ribs, a small portion of tempura (one each of shrimp, squash, broccoli, and a couple others that I can't remember at the moment), a couple gyoza, a heaping bowl of rice, and a miso soup.  Our lunches also came with a freebie serving of cold tofu and four small side plates of the usual banchan (like bean sprouts and kimchi).   L.A. ribs were tender, tempura was fried in well-maintained oil (unlike some other places where you can taste that the fry oil needs changing or that they didn't wait for it to come to temp before frying).   Plenty of booths, seating is spacious enough to be relatively comfortable for a short stay. Decor is...ehhh, nobody's there for the view anyway.   All in all, A-OK for a quick weekday stopover spot."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork bone soup which came with some purple rice and a couple of side dishes. Overall the experience was underwhelming...  The pork was very tough and took a long time to remove it from the bone. The soup was only hot and didn't have any flavour other than spice. The price was decent for the amount but if you go to any other Korean restaurant you could get much better quality.   The only redeeming quality was the potato side dish. Make sure if you go you order a second round of dishes. You only get 1 extra per person!"}
{"text":"All I really have to say about this restaurant is: it's alright.  The first time I visited, I was impressed. But that was partly due to the fact that I don't eat out often and rarely have Korean food. I visited a few more times after that, and with each visit, I grew wary of the food and the expensive menu.   The Good: - no line-up, fast service - good ambience in the restaurant, whether it's for a family outing or a romantic date, this is the place for you.   - very clean and organized.   The Not-So-Good - the pricing is a little high for the quality of the food. Most of the stews/soups are above $10, and the flavor doesn't match up to the price at all. There are cheaper korean places with better tasting dishes, so if you are going for the food, I'd say check out Korea Town on Bloor or the restaurants on Spadina China Town. - when I went to eat alone, they put me in an awkwardly small table crammed between two larger ones. I felt uncomfortable and I'm sure the groups sitting beside me felt that way too. It wasn't the best experience.  - debit card can only be used when you spend past a certain amount of money.   The Final Verdict: 6/10"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great...   Bibimbap was kinda plain but wasn't bad.  Waitress seems in a rush to make you place your order (asked me 3 times in less than 5 minutes) but Korean restaurants (and ppl) aren' t known for being the most patient.  Other dishes might be better though so worth a shot"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I ate here. Called in with my husband and baby for lunch. Ordered a shared special which came with beers- nice food well cooked. However the server forgot to put in order for our second course. They did apologise when we pointed out same, but as it was going to take a while for it to be cooked we couldn't wait. The head server said he has wondered why we were still there after only eating a small dish but didn't come to ask us or our server did we need anything else.  Good food but poor service. There's too much on offer in the area for me to think about returning soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant was packed with people so I thought why not give it a try.  I have to say it's a hidden gem.  We ordered calamari and shrimp bibinbap and  Beef bulgogi. The service was very nice and fast.  First the small appetizer came and they were delicious. After that the calamari came the calamari was nice but the sauce I didn't liked the taste much. After a short while the shrimp bibinbap came they brought it with a miso soup. The bibinbap was amazing. The bulgogi came at the same time and omg The beef was so tender the meat almost melt in the mouth. This place is amazing I will definitely go again. Would totally recommend it. It's not stroller friendly cause the place is not that big but definitely a place u must have to try."}
{"text":"Walked in on a cold Friday night and got a table immediately. But the place is pretty big so wasn't that surprised.   We ordered some hot sake, green tea, spicy beef soup and a bulgogi bibimbap. Our server was really nice, always smiling and our good was out in 15mins. I liked my bulgogi but it's not best I've had, it seemed little plain. The beef however was very well marinated. The spicy beef soup was also nice but I think the pork would have been better. The sides were really good though.   Overall it wasn't bad but it's also not the best for Korean cuisine. I would like to give 3.5 but I don't know how to on yelp :/"}
{"text":"The lunch combo was great! We got moved around but we were given some complimentary side little rich but really nice"}
{"text":"Lovely little Korean place right downtown. Nice atmosphere and very efficient service. I had the seafood udon soup and little table plates. The soup portion was huge so I opted out of the app to start. Plates were good too, the kimchi really had some kick! Would come back here everyday for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good Korean restaurant in downtown Toronto. We came across it we walked along the street looking for restaurant to catch our eye.   The banchan they served with all well done and my boyfriend really enjoyed their kimchi. It was his first venture into Korean food and he found this place to be a great intro to it! Gotta love a guy who can take his spice!  He ordered the kimchi stew and me wanting to venture out from my go to soon tofu, went with the bulgogi stew. The kimchi stew was pretty standard of with plenty of meat and veges within. I enjoyed my bulgogi stew, the soup having the sweet and savory taste of the bulgogi meat.   The stews with in good portions and I loved how they had rice cakes in both of them, something I miss in most other Korean restaurants. Prices are very reasonable at about $10 a dish, comparable to the California Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Good service, good food! Best Korean place in the Downtown core! We had the regular & bulgogi bibimbap + the complementary kimchi side dishes. More to try next time & can't wait to"}
{"text":"Food solid. Enjoyed the soybean soup- bit on the spicy side but nice. Service attentive. Refilled water quickly, got extra banchan when asked. Bathroom clean. Made me feel good about the overall cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"im no expert in korean culture so i can only say as far as how i enjoyed the experience.   I ordered the kimchi bibimbap and it was pretty good (its just that i love spicy food but i have a low spice tolerance) i was given a bunch of appetizers as well such as glass noodles, kimchi, potatoes, bean sprouts, veggies and a sort of pickle thing idk what its called.   Staff was incredibly kind when speaking to you. They always make sure your food is okay they have a lot of patience for you.   Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"I went here with a Korean friend and she gave it a thumbs up as well. I am new to Korean cuisine so had some apprehensions but turned out I really enjoyed the spices and the little side dishes. The service is fast, the ambience is great and the food is inexpensive and delicious. Definitely will be going there again."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Limit of 2-3 side dish refills. The food is not bad, but with SO many korean restaurants around town, this place really falls short amongst the competition."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pork bone soup and bibimbap restaurants in downtown Toronto. I have to say the taste is great, service is moderate (it used to be superb) and the banchan is delicious. Unfortunately I guess they cheap out lately. We used to ask for some extra banchan (just once) because we love it so much but they are now hesitate to refill them for you, although if you ask a few more time they will bring it to you. What a shame!  The only complain I have is that they have been using too much MSG in their food. But this phenomenon is recent. Why ruin your wonderful recipe with fake msg flavour??? I get a serious headache every time I step out of their restaurant. I will come back for your bibimbap but honestly as much as I want to have your pork bone soup again, I hate to get that migraine every time."}
{"text":"I had a cold bibimbap for dinner here. The environment is clean and tidy. They offer very friendly service and the music is good. The food is delicious and they are generous to give side dishes."}
{"text":"Food Quality - great meat. Good sides  Menu Design - average  Service - poor, had to wait along multiple steps of service  Decor - average Location - good Price - pricey. $19 for regular sized bulgogi. \"Refills\" on side dishes are $4 ea after 2 individual ones?!  Go to Korea town instead"}
{"text":"Alright ... I've been meaning to try this place and today was it. I called in a take-out order (Bulgogi Bibimbap & Kimchi pancake) I walked despite the rain so perhaps my expectations were high.    First impressions? I wanted to sit down and eat! Contrary to the entrance, it was spacious and had a nice cozy feel to it. Service was good considering the limited interaction i had for take-out; quick and friendly.   THE FOOD: for $13 the bibimbap was somewhat of a disappointment (insert sad trombone music here). Tasted alright but the portion was relatively small and meat to rice ratio was far from acceptable - less than 4oz. of beef or so it felt. But it was cooked well, and they accommodated my request for a scrambled egg (a runny yolk is my kryptonite ... people who like it are sick and should seek help :p - LMAO sorry back to subject) ...  so big thank you for that!   Now comes the Kimchi Pancake. Its huge! It should be a shared entrée, NO ONE should eat so much in one sitting because then you end up writing a totally incoherent Yelp review of what feels like your last meal on earth - just saying lol. Way too much spring onion to my liking, and every bite had too much going on with the flour, spring onion, the Kimchi ... Tasty I'd say, but belongs elsewhere on the menu. I'd make smaller bite size versions of it and add it to the 7 hundred side dishes they gave me with my food (all acceptable condiments BTW no real umph to any of them).   VERDICT: For $29 I ended up with WAY more than enough food for two; so I will be experimenting with my left overs at home. It hit the spot on a whole but I hate to admit I've had better. I will return though; considering the convenience from work."}
{"text":"Do you like eating Bimbimbap???  Kimchi Korea House is the place for you to eat it!!! We live far and there are Korean restaurants near us but we drive to TO just for their Bimbimbap. You can choose between the plain rice or the purple rice. But why plain when the purple rice is so much better. They are served in a hot stone and there's a variety of selections from their regular, tofu, mushrooms, vegetarian, chicken, pork, kimchi, bulgogi, salmon, eel, shrimp and LA ribs. They are #1 place for Bimbimbap! I personally love their pork Bimbimbap with purple rice and add a egg on top!!!  They appetisers and they are awesome. I would suggest ordring their Takoyaki as an appetiser. The calamari on the other that we ordered was not the greatest, so skip it.  The service is fast. The washroom is clean."}
{"text":"Its cheap..... not really much else to say about kimchi house. Its a decent spot near dundas square that serves korea food. When I went there, I ordered the bibimbap, and chicken wings. Both cost less than $25 which is decent, but both were underwhelming. The meat on the bibimbap was rubbery, and the sauce on the wings werent very good. The service was actaully really good; food was served promptly, given that it was a busy night, and we also managed to get refills on our banchan. Kimchi house does not deserve lower than a 3 star, because I will probably be back for cheap korean food, but if youre really craving, i reccomend else where."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Korean restaurant downtown! I love the Bulgogi and Pork Bone soup here. The environment is nice and the service here is great! Never disappoints and favor always stays the same no matter how many times I come here."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. We had dinner early because we have seen a line out the door. They do not give you a large selection of appetizers but they do have a clean taste. Hubby tried a bowl because he likes digging up the crunchy rice at the bottom. I tried the noodles which had a tad too much sugar to my liking. Staff was nice and accommodating"}
{"text":"I went about two weeks ago with my boyfriend to have dinner there. Decor is nice, looks a bit modern, has comfortable booths. I ordered the soft tofu stew and he ordered the pork bone soup. Our server was really nice and attentive. Sides were really salty, edible but salty (probably jarred). However, mid-way into our meals, my boyfriend found two flys in his soup. Ironically enough when I started to stir the soft tofu stew, I found one as well. I called over the server and showed him the 'fly' on my spoon. He immediately cleared the stew and asked me if I wanted another dish, I said no. I think our server felt really bad lol. I don't blame him, I blame the people in the kitchen. They managed to take my meal off the bill but not my boyfriend's. How does that work?... Will I come back? Nope. It's a shame really. They're a relatively new restaurant and this type of thing should not be happening."}
{"text":"Decent food but super strange seating arrangements for a table service restaurant. We arrived and asked for a table for 2 - we got seated at a table for 4. Weird, since the restaurant was about 20% full and there were still a handful of 2-person tables, but whatever. About 10 minutes later, another party of 2 is put at our 4-person table :/ Awkward. And there are STILL numerous tables for 2 in the other half of the restaurant. Apparently the waitress tried seating them closer to the door with another group but it was too cramped so they declined and was then sat with us. I'm not exactly sure what their system for seating is, but it was uncomfortable all around. I've honestly never heard of communal seating with parties of 2 or more - usually just single diners at a large table, like at King's Noodle.  As for the food, it was decent. We got the Sweet and Spicy Chicken and Bulgogi main entrees. The thing to note is that some mains DO NOT come with rice, which is super weird. You're basically paying extra for something that would normally come with the main at other Korean restaurants. The menu also doesn't note which entree doesn't come with rice so you have to ask when ordering. Overall, it came to just over $40 for two dishes and an extra rice.   For now, I'm going to stick with Seor Ak San, where we spent $25, the food ranged from on par to better, and we didn't have to share a table with randoms, haha."}
{"text":"Great location, great happy service, lively atmosphere and above average Korean food!   Clean as well!  Came here with 3 others. Great times by all. They have great plum wine as well- ask them about it!"}
{"text":"I am a Korean and have tried many Korean food in Toronto and this location would be one of the top Korean restaurant I would recommend if you were looking for quality. The price is definitely higher than most Korean restaurants in Toronto however it totally makes sense when comparing the quality and flavour. On the other hand, the service was great, efficient and very respectful. If I am downtown and feel like eating korean food, I'd definitely go back to this location."}
{"text":"My friends and I dropped by because we wanted Korean food and were in the area. The food was great and definitely had us all stuffed. The staff are wonderful as well. my friend forgot something at the store and only found out around 10:30pm after she'd gone home. Me and another friend decided to see if we could go get it so we called them around 11 to see if we could go get it. They not only kept it for us, but waited after closing time for us to get there and pick it up. By far the one of my best experiences with service at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Over the years, our pallets change; what we loved yesterday isn't necessarily what we love today and won't be what we will love tomorrow.  It seems that Korean food is winning me over more these days than other East Asian cuisines. Luckily, Toronto has some really great options!  I had been to Kimchi House many years ago and thought it was pretty good. A month or so ago I had a real hankering for Korean but didn't want to drive all the way to Little Korea in the west end or uptown north of Sheppard. I had remembered this place and convinced my wife to head over.  The great news is that this place was better than I had remembered. We actually ordered more than we needed but I'm not a quitter so we beat the table! ;)  If you are downtown and in the mood for good Korean food, then this is a fantastic option. It's too bad that they are so close to that horrible hack of a Macha ice cream shop that puts out a terrible radius of failure around it!"}
{"text":"I went as a third wheel on a hot date this evening, and I have to say I really enjoyed it! I've been slowly making the rounds, trying to determine which Korean restaurants I like best in the city, and this is probably a contender for first place at this point. Mind you, I have lots more to see/taste. Kimchi Korea House is clean with ample seating and has cozy booths as well as tables.  So first, the service was incredibly friendly and accommodating, but not overbearing. The lithe young man who was taking care of our table helped explain a menu item as best he could, and checked in to ensure we enjoyed the items we inquired about. Additionally, he set down my glass of water - I kid you not - with a flourish. A FLOURISH.   Two of us ordered the bulgogi bibimbap, and the third ordered the pork bone soup. The dishes were filling, hot and fresh. The bibimbap was perfect, but the pork bone soup could have used some sort of acidity or vinegar or spices to cut through some of the thick, fatty flavours. The \"fixins\", as we call them, were interesting and had some different flavours than what I'd tried before at other establishments, including tofu, kimchi, bean sprouts and potatoes. Our menu items were reasonably priced but I did notice several items outside of the soups and stews that seemed slightly steep.   I'd definitely recommend it to those in the area, and would certainly try other menu items in the future. Alas, I have many more Korean restaurants to try, and discerning taste to develop."}
{"text":"Yummy! I got their bulgogi bibimbap for lunch yesterday. I learned you always need to add an egg! Delicious. This place has such friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Low key, Korean spot in Toronto! We entered on a Wednesday, early evening and the place was pretty empty. The ambience is casual and had a modern interior, with Korean influences. The food was above average, the side dishes were great, especially the potato dish. It had a very deep flavour, mixed with a soy and what I'm assuming is a honey base for the perfect sweet and savory. The portions here are good too. We ordered a variety of dishes and this restaurant gets the Korean stamp of approval taste wise from me. We're from out of the town so the prices were a little bit higher than we were used to, but I think this is the norm across Toronto. However, we did kind of get a vibe that they were being a little more conservative with the number of side dish refills (which is usually unlimited at traditional Korean restaurants): they took our side dishes away after a second time and never brought them back (we thought they took it for refills)."}
{"text":"This place is a good substitute if you don't want to trek to Koreatown. I haven't been blown away by the dishes but I've always left a satisfied camper with my belly full. My favourite dish is the kalbi ribs soup. It's a good choice for those who don't like spicy food.  Pros: -convenient location -a good selection that will satisfy your k-food cravings -service is fast and friendly -servings are quite large  Cons: -seating is 'communal' in some parts of the restaurant, though tables are not. I was sitting at a table for 4 next to strangers. I'm sure both parties felt a bit too close for comfort -they charge extra for egg on your bibimbap, which I think is a staple to the dish  Tldr; a convenient ($$) alternative to ktown :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday evening and we were quite satisfied. For appetizers, we ordered Takoyaki and Gyoza, and for our entrees, we ordered a Bulgogi Bibimbap and a Sweet & Spicy Chicken. It came with a variety of banchan appetizers which were delicious and to our expectations.   The service was wonderful. Everyone was sweet and attentive. The pricing can definitely add up though."}
{"text":"We ordered the seafood pancake, pork bone soup, chicken and beer Monday combo and ddokbokki. Seafood pancake was very thin but not greasy at all with only abysmal pieces of seafood. The pork bone soup was my favorite - the bones contained a lot of meat, tender succulent meat. However, there were only a few pieces (2?) of potatoes and 3 chunks of meat in the soup. The soup was very flavorful and thick which I liked. The chicken in the chicken and beer combo was another great item, having crispy skin and tender meat. Ddokbokki was not bad either with pieces of large shrimp and cuttlefish. Overall I would recommend the pork bone soup as I also noticed many other tables ordering it. Note: you can only refill 2 side dishes for free. I was disappointed as a true Korean restaurant should be able to refill all as many times as the customer wants."}
{"text":"After a brutally cold day, I wanted something to warm me up. I ordered the Kimchi Gigae. The soup was flavourful and I love cooked kimchi. The soup had a lot of kimchi, tofu, and a decent amount of pork.  We also ordered the kimchi pajan. This was good, but I've had better. The prices were average for a Korean restaurant.   Service was okay and the place got busy later in the evening. My biggest complaint would be there was really cold draft coming in from the outside and the place was cold."}
{"text":"I'm sure the only reason people have been here is because they quit after seeing the lineup at santonsei ramen place and just wanted to eat STAT This place is very clean, very polite and pretty good all round. Prices are going to 2-4$ higher than your standard K-town fare, but you aren't going to get loads of MSG in your food. The food is good, but knowing that I can get killer Korean food at 75% of the price of this place would not likely have me come back.  The banchan is alright- the potatos are surprisingly good..and the kimchi is fine. but again, my favourite places are still 1) buk chang dong 2) seor ak san 3) Owl of minerva  This place would barely make it to the top 10 except that it is located pretty close to the ramen place that you WON'T get into anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying actual korean and I was really happy. I had the mushroom bimibap and it was great. The waiter was really attentive and nice. We had a fairly large party and they were really great about spot checks."}
{"text":"This place is much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. There's plenty of seats, but that's about the only plus.   The food wasn't bad, but I don't think it was anywhere near authentic. I had the soon tofu and although the portions were big, the soup tasted quite watered down. The spice level was way lower than what you'd expect at a Korean place.   Almost all Korean places I've been to serve free hot tea. When I asked for tea here, they brought a mug with a teabag and charged over $1 for it.   Hop across the street to Bap Bo and I think you'll get better food."}
{"text":"Best Bimbimbap ever! My favorite! I love their appetizers as well; super authentic. The ambience is cool nice and the stuff is very nice. Always having a good time there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the staff was friendly. As someone who does not love Korean food, I must say that I would be willing to come back here again. The food was good although the menu seemed a little small but I would recommend it for those of you who really love Korean food."}
{"text":"Its alright. Not the best, but it's a good korean eats. I wish they have more noodle options though."}
{"text":"This is one of the better quality Korean restaurants in the city. The prices are noticeably higher compared to other Korean restaurants in the city and they don't have unlimited refills on side dishes. But still worth it if you want better ingredients. And they are sitting on prime real estate so a premium is expected.   This place has the best bibimbap in the city if you ask me. Fresh ingredients, and many options for bibimbap.   Service is not something I care about too much for an Asian place but it's what you can expect from most Korean owned places: chronically understaffed, and \"ok\" English communication skills. Depending on where you sit flagging down a server can be difficult. I don't really mind. If being pampered by a nice server is critical for your dining experience, I would say don't visit an Asian place to begin with.  Verdict: worth a try if you want good quality Korean and willing to pay a little extra."}
{"text":"Came here with two other friends from school (this place is just a few minutes walk from Ryerson) for dinner and we ordered the kamjatang (pork bone soup). It was good, I liked the flavour of the broth and the meat was tender and fell off the bone without resistance. For an Asian restaurant, it isn't loud so its a place of quiet if you're looking for it - good for conversation. The atmosphere of the restaurant feels more classy than your typical Korean restaurant, but still casual. Service was timely and prices were reasonable :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good korean food if you are around the Eaton Centre area looking for a delicious meal. I always come here with my family who love this place just as much as I do! All the menu items that I've tried have never been lacking in flavour. We've had one bad experience with one of the waiters, but most are very nice.   They have traditional side dishes and the potato one is super bomb. They also let you refill 3 side dishes I think. I would recommend their spicy seafood tofu stew, salmon bibimbap, japchae and seafood pancake!  Highly recommend this place as the decor is awesome and the food is pretty good for the prices and portions."}
{"text":"Out of all places downtown, this one happens to be one of those Asian restaurants that only accept cash unless your order is over $25. Maybe they assume that all of the tourists coming out of the Greyhound station across the street carry cash or something.   Food is pretty typical for a Korean restaurant although you can find much better ones in K-town. I've tried a couple of their bibimbaps which are decent. I wish they had offered purple rice instead. Their side dishes are pretty good, especially that fish cake, and they are refillable! Service is okay for a restaurant of this size but some of the waiters had a hard time describing the food items in English. That being said, they are pretty friendly and they kept coming back to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"We had a large booth to ourselves and ordered the vegetable tempura, which was pretty good. There was a lot of variety (broccoli, sweet potato, beans, etc.) We also ordered the chicken bibimbap and the vegetarian one as well. It came with lots of little accompaniments, most of which were delicious. I really liked the zesty pickled cabbage and cucumber and the salad was very refreshing. The server even threw in two bowls of hearty soup! The bibimbap was served sizzling hot in a bowl. However, I didn't think it was very flavourful, even after adding the hot sauce and soy sauce. I asked if they had any hotter sauce and our server brought out the sriracha sauce, but it still didn't have the kick I was looking for.   Service here was really great. Our server was so warm and welcoming. They had Christmas carols playing and a really modern and clean ambience. They also have daily specials (see photo for more information)."}
{"text":"Not a real Korean restaurant is it does not offer unlimited banchan refills.  Food was pretty good, service was good, but it gets the 1-star non-traditional adapted to Canada rating, just like Japanese restaurants that don't bake tip into their prices."}
{"text":"Kimchi Korea House serves solid Korean food. The restaurant is clean. The service is friendly (although, slow at times). The prices are slightly higher than the Korean restaurants in Korean town by Christie station.   Kimchi Korea House is a solid choice if you are craving Korean food and you do not want to make your way to Korean town. I have been hear a few times and sampled various dishes including the bibimbap, tofu stew and jap-chae. The food is good, but it is not the best I have ever had. It lacks a \"je ne sais quoi\".   Overall, I would recommend Kimchi Korea House if you are near Dundas."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbap and It's probably the worst I've ever had. All the food ordered had absolutely no flavor. We had to add so much sauce to taste anything. They charged extra for EVERYTHING. You only get one refill on the small side dishes provided with your meal and they barely give you any to begin with. Rude staff who made sarcastic comments made the experience even worst. Had to ask 3 times for water refills. They charge gratuity on parties of 6+. The waiter definitely did not deserve a tip that large with his rude attitude and sarcastic comments."}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet Monday afternoon with two frienda and got the regular bibimbap, pork bibimbap, sweet and sour pork, and naengmyun (cold noodles). Everything arrived at the same time and was quite delicious. The regular bibimbap came packed with a variety of vegetables, an egg, and some small pieces of beef, while the pork bibimbap came with less vegetables but a load of pork belly slices in some sweet and spicy sauce. Super tasty, though my friend did pay extra to add an egg to the pork one.The cold noodles were nice and chewy and was quite a large serving. The sweet and sour pork was nice and crunchy, no complaints there. The food here is a bit pricier, but that is not too big of an issue to me since they do load their dishes with a lot of ingredients. Service was fine too. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Good food...kinda of pricy for korean dishes.  As previous posters have indicate ..Really, extra charge for an egg? The korean restaurants down Yonge street are more Farley priced.  Side dishes were small...you get two refills for free.  The seafood pancake was rubbery...thought it would crisper.   Going to walk Yonge street next time I'm craving for korean food."}
{"text":"Food was good, but disappointed in service. The girls who worked there were polite enough to us but were yelling across the restaurant, which wasn't even that busy so they could have talked more quietly. They refilled once only 2 of 6 side dishes and offered to bring more for a charge which is absurd for a Korean restaurant. The side dishes did taste better than some other Korean restaurants in the area. The food was a little pricier for Korean food but location is central and there was no wait, which is great.  My friend ordered the yook-gae-jang which in the menu promised glass noodles, but when it arrived there were none.  I'll likely go back as it is a convenient location with good food but not a winner for price or service. Perhaps I'll see if they can do takeout."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving some korean so we decided to eat here. I ordered the bulgogi mushroom stew and my friend ordered the bulgogi bibimbap. We didn't know that they only took debit if it was 15 dollars or over. And we were going to pay with our bills split and by debit. So we added our bills together and I payed some of it with debit because I had no cash while my friend payed the rest in cash. WE USUALLY ALWAYS GIVE A TIP, but due to the cash/debit issue we totally forgot. AS WE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE. AFTER PAYING WE WERE EMBARRASSINGLY STOPPED AND TOLD TO GIVE A TIP. A lady (maybe the owner came up to us and asked us to tip) IF YOU GO HERE, YOU HAVE TO GIVE/LEAVE A TIP. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THEY LET YOU LEAVE WITHOUT IT. It was very embarrassing to be stopped by the entrance and forced to leave a tip. That we had to do by DEBIT CARD! We did a 5 dollar debit transaction for the tip. (So why couldn't they just let us pay our split bills by debit? Idk) NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED. They definitely thought it was easier to do to two young girls. I SERIOUSLY DARE OTHERS TO TRY AND NOT LEAVE A TIP AT THIS PLACE.    The food was good, but I've had way better service and korean food at yonge and finch."}
{"text":"The restaurant is near the Eaton Center a few minutes away from Yonge and Dundas. It's a good option for getting a good lunch that is in a cozy clean restaurant. They have a lot of Korean food options.   I tried the LA Ribs lunch box and my friend tried the seafood rice cake. If you like kalbi beef you get a decent portion of the ribs with some gyoza dumplings and purple rice. The seafood rice cake is spicy and the sauce is quite soupy. My friend did not enjoy her meal as much as I did."}
{"text":"Kimchi Korea House is packed on weekdays! I came here for lunch on a regular weekday and there were tons of people waiting in line for their lunch. It was very close to Dundas and Yonge, where schools, businesses and the great Eaton Centre was located.   I ordered their Tempura Lunch Box for $9.95. It came with a Miso Soup and Salad. The food was super fast, but we later found out the food that came belonged to the table beside ours as I didn't order the salmon tempura bento box. But even so, the lunch box came before I even finished the miso soup and salad. What I found very interesting, was that in addition to the banchan they provided us, we were presented with a slice of very soft tofu the size of regular banchan dishes as an appetizer. The sauce of this tofu was delicious - definitely recommend!  As for their Tempura Lunch Box, it consisted of two shrimps with many other vegetables such as sweet potato, asparagus, eggplant, etc. It would be preferable if they had written in mixed vegetable tempura on the menu or what types of tempura they consisted of because I presumed that there would be more shrimp tempura in this lunch box. In addition, instead of the regular white rice, this was purple/brown rice that was served in the bento box. The glass noodles were also made on par! Overall, the quality of the food was decent, I enjoyed the side dishes a little more than the tempura itself."}
{"text":"I have always walked by this place on my way home from the office. I finally decided to try this place with a few girlfriends before an event at Philip Nathan Square. What I think of this place: 1 - Seating: It was satisfactory  2 - Service: I thought the servers were nice, but service level was below average. I wouldn't say poor but it was below average. Why? I think there were just too many tables and not enough servers. I had to ask a few times just to get refill on my tea. The service could be improved.  3 - Ambiance: This is a causal place, depending on the amount of tables, this place can get really, really packed and a bit noisy.  4 - Food: I have to say, the food was okay."}
{"text":"I came here twice, and the service and food were great. They have reasonable prices and a nice atmosphere. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place was decent. I wouldn't necessarily choose it if I was back in the area because there's so many options. We actually chose it because they accepted credit and many others didn't. No one left hungry and no one was disappointed."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, I love how it is set up inside! The side dishes were so delicious and the waiter was very nice and came back often to check on us. The food however was not that great. We ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and bulgogi + beef tofu soup. I wasn't a big fan of anything. I wanted plain white rice but they came out with some bean rice. It taste okay. Everything was just okay, nothing special except for the side dishes which I liked very much."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... Korean fast food with lots of side dishes... Pretty much all you need to know... Oh ya,  young waitress with short dyed hair is hot."}
{"text":"Walking back on Dundas from Kensington/Chinatown Toronto towards and found this place.  Nice, clean cool place.  Bim Bim Bop, Bone broth soups and Stews are their forte.  We had the Mushroom and the Eel Bim Bim Bop - both were non-traditional but very delicious nevertheless.  The portions were small but they were filling enough.  I highly recommend Kim Chi Korea House if you're interested in trying Bim Bim Bop especially if you want to try non-traditional toppings."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time last night. We had a good meal. I loved the regular bibimbap. He enjoyed to spicy pork neck soup. It was very spicy so if you don't like things really hot make sure you ask for it to be mildly spicy. You get lots of different types of banchan. The kimchi was a bit mild and sweet, but still tasty. Good service and our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times over the past 1.5 years and most recently last Sunday night for dinner with a gal pal. Definitely been to way better Korean restaurants in Toronto (Koreatown, North York, etc) in terms of food and value, but Kimchi Korea House is located super conveniently downtown near the Eaton centre and imo there's not a better Korean restaurant in this area downtown, i.e. waaaaaay better than Bapbo in terms of food and value.  Lessons learned- 1. Banchans (complimentary appetizers) are not unlimited, but I believe each table gets free refills for 2 choices. 2. Great service, usually. Especially if you speak Korean. 3. Grapefruit-flavored soju. Ask for it. That is all. 4. The bibimbaps are decent, smaller than the monster ones at Bapbo across the street, but plenty of ingredient variety. Vegans can rejoice since there is at least 1 option for y'all (ask them to omit the egg on top). The salmon bibimbap is pretty decent, as are the mushroom one and the tofu one. 5. The udon is huge (but mostly fluid) and looks soooo pretty with all those veggies on top. Recommend. 6. The spicy pollack stew $14.95 (pescatarian) - pretty big, but half of the volume is fluid. Generous amount of actual big chunks of fish, I was satisfied. For a cheaper and smaller fix for seafood cravings order the Soft Tofu Stew or Soybean Stew - seafood option $9.95.  7. Entrees come with rice. Purple rice (= black + white rice) is available at no extra charge, but you gotta ask for it. 8. Nothing here is spicy."}
{"text":"I went today as my first time here during lunch hour. The atmosphere of the restaurant were great; staff was friendly and were nice enough to let me pay my debit card (since the only do debit over $15 order) my pork bone soup was delicious though negligent on my part when I forgot to advise the waitress to make it less spicy. Overall I was satisfied with my lunch!"}
{"text":"It should be called \"not so much kimchi house\" if they don't have enough kimchi either in their kimchi bibimbab or kimchi pancake.  This time, we had kimchi bibimbab (mixed rice in hot stone bowl), kimchi pancake, and pork bone.  For kimchi bibimbab, the sweet tangy yellow radish (dan moo ji) was overpowering the entire taste of the dish. But for both this dish and kimchi pancake, it definitely felt like it did not have enough kimchi in it. Pork bone soup was pretty good though, rich and not way too spicy.  Tables are not really spacious but this could also mean that they give a lot of side dishes ;) but so do all the other Korean restaurants.  Lighting was a little dim but this could be a plus side if you get Asian blush when you drink. They have lots of delicious Korean liquors with various options.  Staffs are nice and informative!:)"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a conference and went here with a friend.  We just picked the restaurant because I had never eaten Korean food and wanted to try it.  I was quite pleasantly surprised.    We both had different bibimbap, he had mushroom and I had tofu and veggies.  As others said, the dinners came with six side dishes which were nice and spicy, not too spicy but just enough.  As we finished eating, the owner came by to chat.  She wanted to know how we liked the food, which led to a wide ranging conversation about food, travel, raising families, and politics.  Really a totally enjoyable conversation and a lovely way to spend an evening in a new city.  If ever I am in Toronto again, I will definitely eat there."}
{"text":"Food is good, and the price is decent and the service is good. Just had one bad experience with a waitress after being ask to tip them more money when me and my friends didn't have enough."}
{"text":"i've been here many times. very good food. esp the pork bone soup and kimchi pancake ! what i don't like is they actually ask for tips. :/"}
{"text":"Decent place for some korean food. I wouldn't say there's anything rly outstanding bout this place i'm sure there's other korean restaurants around that are a way better option than here   I got some kind of fish soup which was alright i guess. I was expecting a lot more flavour out of it but yeah there wasn't much. I also got like some kind of chicken dish too and I didn't like it much either. If I remember correctly, there wasn't much meat on the chicken which was like ?!?! boi don't be playing me like dat like no   Oh right. The older servers (the ahjummas) are not as nice and attentive as the younger servers."}
{"text":"Its a good place however the food is not great for the price. It will be nice if the servers put more effort in explaining the dishes and recommending the ones that can be adequate to your palatte."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of korean food at baseline, but was told this place was good to gave it a try. Went there for dinner and order a bulgogi bibimbap, since I don't eat spicy food and missing out on other plates like gamgatan.   The food itself was decent, nothing to write home about. The service was decent as well. Overall, nothing special about it, but nothing bad neither. The prime location helps a lot for the fairly crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"The BEST Korean in the Neighborhood if not the City. Consistent Clean and Flavorful Cuisine. Friendly service.  Competitive pricing. Daily Specials that make going back easy without breaking the Budget."}
{"text":"A friend and I dropped in last week to satisfy my craving for korean gamjatang (pork bone soup) and we were not disappointed!    Gamja (potato) tang (soup) is a stew using pork neck or pork spine simmered with potatoes in delicious sauce with perilla leaves and perilla seeds garnished with green onions.  Another friend had warned me of there not being enough pork but my bowl came with 4 large pork bones with lots of tender meat ready to fall off the bone.  The meat and the broth with the perilla seeds were delicious with a hint of spice and just in case you were wondering, I was that girl who's finished two bowls of rice with my gamjatang in less than 15 minutes (I did explain I had a craving, right?)  My friend enjoyed her bibimbap as well but I promise when we come back, I'll try the rest of the menu for a more comprehensive review... assuming I'm not having a gamjatang craving, that is..."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekend and it was pretty busy. There's not many Korean restaurants around Yonge and Dundas so I can see why this could be the only option for Korean food if you are near.   Service: I was seated immediately but no one gave us menus or offered water. My party was neglected until we got up ourselves to get the menu from the counter. My first impression is that they don't have an efficient system to make sure all customers are serviced soon upon seating.   Food: Pork bibimbap: this was okay. The pork was thinly sliced and it lack flavor. I ended up not eating a lot because it was just mostly fat. The bibimbap is okay. You can't really go wrong with bibimbap since it's just a bunch of stuff mixed together.   Seafood pancake: this was mediocre. It has too much dough. It is also really overpriced. It was $16 for a pancake while many other restaurants is around $10.  Galbi beef: the portion was extremely small for the price. It felt like a side dish rather than a main entree for $16.   Overall the food was okay. Service was horrible. But definitely overpriced Korean food. I would rather not eat Korean food in this area ever again or I'll take the initiative to venture out to ktown for cheaper and better tasting Korean food."}
{"text":"The food has become terrible! It's bland or full of sugar.  We asked for more side dishes which is standard in Korean restaurants and we were told we could only have 2 more after our first set! I'd say there was also 3% meat to 97%filler vegetables (yellow and green onions). If you're looking for something that looks the same as the pictures or even close, don't bother. But the prices have gone up! Save your money and don't bother!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place. The atmosphere is really cozy, suitable for any occasion. I went at around 1pm and the place is packed with people! So my friend and I had to wait for around 10 mins, which is not too bad. The side dishes were pretty good, however when we has to ask multiple times for only one refill. Maybe it is because we came at a busy time. The main dishes were not bad. I ordered a kimchi bibimbap, kimchi is rather sweet and not spicy enough for my taste, but still tasty! So the food is all good and we paid with debit. We didn't pay much tips in the debit machine because we wanted to tip in coins instead. Plus, their service was not that great. As I was taking out my wallet for tips in cash, a lady actually came up to us and said we didn't tip them enough. So we said we are paying tips in cash. Maybe this is unusual for her, but I think it was rude of her to come up to us and tell us we have to tip a certain amount. Even when we took out the coins, she was eyeing us from afar and speaking Korean to the waiters while looking at us. For a second we didn't even want to pay tips because of how she acted.   But in general, this place is located in a convenient place and the food was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Dinner was very good. Reminds us of authentic dishes we had in Korea.  The owner was very professional and checked to ensure we enjoyed the food. She shared that the restaurant was less than 6 months old and the she's own after being in the restaurant industry since 1985. Da Woon, our server was very nice, as well.  We had the pork Bibimbop dolsot and la bi beef soup. Both were excellent, prepared authentically and tasty.  Most of the patrons were Asian.   We plan to come again. Thank you ajumma, Lee!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I came here once. Recommended it to a friend, came here again and still loved it.  The first time I got a bibimbap with beef, and the second time I got a gamjatang. The porkbone soup. It was great both Timex they ha e actual korean servers.  Only downside I can say is we had a lot of difficulty of grabbing someone attention and being forgotten.. It took over half an hour to finally finish paying. Other than that, servers were friendly and nice, food was A++."}
{"text":"I have travelled to Korea many times so I know the real McCoy.  Koreans were stopping at this restaurant with their luggage straight from the airport and I learned years ago a Korean will travel 1-2 hours for Korean food when in a foreign land so I took this as a very positive sign.  The menu was authentic without any cross over to other Asian foods.  Service was very fast and the food was great, it really took me back to the time years ago when I was in South Korea on business.  I highly recommend this place as authenic."}
{"text":"We went in on Friday after work and it was pretty full. They served the appetizers after we ordered and it's the typical set.   I ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbap, it was alright. To add an egg was an extra $1.49 so I skipped on that. I find them to be a tad bit pricier than the other Bibimbap dishes I've had.   The service was great, we were always attended to, despite the busy night.   It's a solid meal, but overall, I think it's ok."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was not that great. The egg pancake was decent and the kim chee was average. A pretty average restaurant but with an above average price I would say. Somehow spent $60+ on just 3 dishes. I do not think it was worth it though.   One couple beside us got bad service ie) was not being served and they just left. I have not seen something like that in a while."}
{"text":"I used to come here pretty frequently for lunch because the location is close to my office. They give you a lot of sides and the food is pretty cheap & tasty. However, one time I found a bug in the chap chae and then we told the manager. Then the waiter also spilt water all over us by accident. After that incident, I never went back."}
{"text":"They have rice wine and bring you a bunch of little appetizers (kimchi, noodles, pickled vegetables etc.) before your meal which makes this a legitimate Korean restaurant for me, comparable to something in nyc's K-town.  Our service could have been improved, after bringing our meals our waiter never came back until we put our coats on and signaled across the room for the bill. The inside has a nice ambiance, the food was what I expected and we enjoyed it.  Just what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Rich pork bone soup. Delectable sides (potatoes were warmed!) Savoury kimchi pancake (not enough kimchi and less flavour than expected though; girlfriend says restaurant should be called \"not so much kimchi house\") Service was quick and attentive. Lighting was dim. Decor was nice. A little on the pricier side (10-15 per dish, including pancake appetizers).  Overall, a decent experience. Would come back if craving Korean food and in the area but would not actively search it out."}
{"text":"This place is not bad despite its basic Korean name. I had the Kimchi chigae and it was very tasty. But then again, it is a dish that is hard to screw up. Everything in the menu had english names which made me doubt their authenticity. For example, Kimchi Chigae was listed as \"Kimchi Soup\" and KamJaTang was \"Pork Bone Soup\". Prices were also high compared to other korean restaurants in town.  The servers however were very friendly and food came in a relatively fast speed. They failed to note that tea is $1 extra and my Kimchi soup meal ended up being $15."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a weekday. It was pretty busy but there was no wait for a table for two. There was a decent selection for side dishes  Ordered a pork bone soup but was pretty disappointed. They did give a lot of meat but it was tough and very difficult to get off the bone. The potatoes inside seemed just a tad undercooked. The soup was pretty spicy but that's up to the individual's discretion. It was pricier than other better-tasting pork bone soups I'm used to having. Probably wouldn't revisit for this dish any time soon."}
{"text":"Best korean place in downtown. Im a korean, and i usually dont like bibimbap... try their tofu bibimbap please! Its the best !!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday for a relatively late (8pm) dinner. It was pretty busy, which was a good sign.  Got seated promptly and got myself the pork bone soup. One of my go to Korean dishes that I love and use as a measure of the quality of food.  We got 5-6 appetizers to start us off and while none of them tasted bad, the quantity was severely limiting. In about 2 bites, I finished each dish off easily. Ordered some more and again, super small portions.  The pork bone soup was a good portion. The meat was cooked fairly well, came off the bone easily but didn't taste overcooked. I would say the spicyness level was moderate or even less spicy than most Korean places. The only thing that I was frustrated about was the lack of potatoes. I'm starting to see this as a trend in Korean restaurants where they stop giving potatoes in pork bone soup. Now I'm not too familiar with the traditional recipe, but back several years ago, you'd always get this huge piece of potato or several. Nowadays, you got nothing or a sliver of it even though in the menu it says that it comes with potatoes. With the dish being $10, I'm expecting them not to cheap out on it. I remember back in the day you'd pay $6 and get a huge portion of meat and potatoes. Now it's just meat. What's happening here...  Anyways, I give this place 3 stars because while the quality is decent, the appetizer portions are small and the prices are a little above average."}
{"text":"I've always had a fear of eating alone in a restaurant, but I think I've gotten over it all thanks to Kimchi House! Odd? I know but I have reasons for it. I was able to notice a lot of the little nuances that I would normally miss because I am usually conversing with my friends! Plus, I didn't feel rushed by the staff which is always a plus.  Service: The Kimchi House staff were so kind and attentive. They worked well with each other! They were singing and enjoying their time together which made the restaurant more lively especially during the slower parts of their day. An added plus was hearing some stellar music (R&B and the newest kpop songs).The staff ask for your drink order shortly after you sit down and serve the banchan right away. If you've never had Korean food before, the staff will explain each dish to you so just ask them!  Food: Banchan - it is on the sweeter side which I preferred since I opted for the Kimchi Stew. They did not fry their potato dish before coating it with the sweet sauce and it tasted just as good.  Kimchi Stew - It had pieces of thinly sliced pork, rice cake, kimchi, and tofu. It was on the spicy side, but I liked it! I found it to be fairly sour but it may be from the kimchi. I can say that I've had better stews at other establishments but I left satisfied and full.  The meal was around $12. They take debit even if it is under $15."}
{"text":"After a long night at nuit blanche me and my friends decided to check this place out. It was quite packed and we had to wait a while for our tables. Okay the food was amazing but the service was average to be honest. I will definitely come back for the chicken Katsu."}
{"text":"We stopped here tonight for Korean food and were pleasantly surprised.  The waitstaff was very helpful when we asked for recommendations.  We both had dumplings (steamed) as an appetizer which were soft and pillowy.  The restaurant also serves small appetizers of pickled cucumber which is both spicy and crunchy, a potato dish that is very yummy, kimchee which is moderately spicy, glass noodles and bean threads.  What a nice surprise and a good way to sample some of the favorite foods.  We have not experienced Korean food so this was a treat for us.  We both ordered bibimbap - I ordered the vegetable one and my partner got the tofu one.  I ordered mine without egg, he got an egg.  We loved our food!  A waiter and our waitress were very attentive, perhaps knowing we were novices, and stopped by frequently to give us tips on how to best eat our dish - letting the rice cook a little on the bottom to become crispy, when to take some sips of soup, how to mix in the sauces, etc.    Our dinner for two with appetizer, the several dishes of Korean tastes and pomegranate tea was around $35 without tip.  We felt it was well worth it.  The atmosphere was very nice, of course the waitstaff was excellent and the food was delicious.  Plus we were stuffed when we left.  I would recommend this but I am not used to Korean food.  I can tell you, for us though,  it was a great experience, plus we saw several other Korean people eating here so we felt we made a good decision in choosing this restaurant."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving bibimbap or soup, I always come here. Best Korean place I have been too yet. The free appetizers are amazing. I usually get the pork bone soup or kimchi tofu stew. The spice is just right. The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing. Just a few minutes away from Toronto eaton centre"}
{"text":"Straight-forward, solid, tasty, cheap Korean food.    Kimchi Korea House is no 5-star restaurant, but what they do, they do well.  We both ordered the bi-bim-bop, the staple of Korean food.  We were pleasantly surprised to see it arrived in an amazingly hot stone bowl, which is exactly how it should be served.  The egg on top was freshly cracked and there was a nice mix of vegetables.  I love how the rice on the bottom gets crispy over the course of the meal.  We both got a free salad and the standard set of 4 or 5 ban-chan (the dishes of pickled goodness that precede a traditional meal in a Korean restaurant).  The kimchi was less spicy than my preference, but the pickled daikon was excellent.  The ban-chan were frequently refilled and service was good.  They recently got an alcohol license, but I was a bit unimpressed by the offerings and declined to order anything.  The decor is...how shall I put it....very modern and the muzak was strange dancy-pop-remixes.  Service was generally pretty good.  The price, however, was excellent, and we both left satisfied."}
{"text":"+Service is nice +Food is of good quality, free refill of 2 appetizers +Seating relatively comfortable though not very spacious -On the pricey side for Korean food"}
{"text":"The waitresses gives good service and the place is clean. It is close to Eaton center which is great. The foods and side dish are good but no refills."}
{"text":"I haven't had much Korean food, but this place was pretty mediocre. One of the treats of having your Bibimbop served in a stone bowl is the burnt crispy rice. Unfortunately, there was none to be had. As a result, it was basically a bowl of rice with an assortment of veggies and some pork. I found the pork soup on the sweet side. The pancake was a bit mushy. Tempura was pretty good:) The service was nice and they split the bill and appetizers if you're in a group."}
{"text":"Busy is usually a good sign and we had a 10 minute wait so I was looking forward to the food. Ordered the pork okonomi and salmon bibimbap. The okonomi was tasty and greasy. Really greasy. Spongy too. Basically it was a tasty, pork flavored grease sponge.  The salmon bibimbap could've used more fresh vegetables and more crunchy rice bits sticking to the bowl. And more flavor. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"Aside from the modern interior design and the nice ambience, Kimchi Korean House is a typical, traditional Korean restaurant.  We ordered 2 bibimbaps and 1 salmon lunch bento.  We all found the food tasty and fresh.  The service was efficient and polite.  We ordered refill of the free kimchi appetizer, and the waitress was quick and pleasant to comply.    Food is authentic and mainstream. They don't offer the exotic and traditional items that the Korean restaurants on Yonge Street, Richmond Hills, offer. No BBQ neither.  Nothing blows our minds, but the price is fair.  This is a good lunch spot for both workdays and weekend."}
{"text":"We came for Friday dinner and we got seated pretty quickly since we came in around 5pm. I came in a group of 5 and we were placed at a booth.   The area that we sat was pretty quiet so it was good for conversations. However, they don't have a designated waiter for each table at this restaurant, so a more quiet seating area means it was difficult to get a server to come.   After we ordered we received 6 small plates of Korean appetizers. Honestly I wish we could have gotten 2 servings because with 5 people we quickly finished what they initially gave us. And since we were sitting at an obscure booth it was difficult to get a server to come and give us refills.   For main dish we ordered the bulgogi bibimbap, kimchi bibimbap, and beef soup. I ordered the bulbogi one and it was pretty good, lots of beef, and the beef was flavourful. I wished they could have given us more rice though.   The bill came up to around $15-$20 after tax and tips per person for ordering a bibimbap. Apparently they don't let you pay by debit/credit unless you ordered at least $15 before tax.   Overall for me this place is just ok, the food wasn't spectacular and the service was slow and they are kinda understaffed. Other dishes are quite expensive I feel and they don't come with a lot of meat. I wouldn't come back any time soon."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty decent as the waitress would come by and ask if we needed anything. Also they have dishes that are fresh and tasty. Most importantly they are clean. I would come back for sure if it wasn't for all the other restaurants in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Its a very nice clean restaurant (well for what you would expect based on nearby ones). The apps they give on the table are yummy first u get tofu with sesame oil and green onion, tasty! Then you get kimchi, bean sprouts, potatoes and salad - all great. Mind you this is the first time i tried korean food. For my main i got Jap chae noodles with beef- it was delicious!!!!!! Reminds me of thai pad see ew but more flavour. I think it is pepper garlic sesame and soy in the noodles - theyre sweet and garlicy so freaking good!! Beef is tender as well- a must try."}
{"text":"???????????? ????????????25??? ????????2??? ???????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Kimchi house is one of my go to Korean restaurants in downtown Toronto. While it doesn't necessarily embodies the true authenticity of some of the restaurants in K-town, it certainly has its charms in terms of the food and the decor.   Having been to Kimchi Korean House multiple times, I've had a good sample of their entire menu. The food is always great and true to Korean culture. The bulgogi is a regular dish I get and it has consistently been delicious. The sampling of side dishes are also good compliments to the main dishes themselves.   If I had to criticize one thing, is that they're menu seems somewhat static. I'd love to see them venture into newer creations, or even Korean fried chicken. Nonetheless, even with the same menu over the years, I've gone back many times."}
{"text":"My Order: Salmon Bibimbap (not bad)   Pros: - Excellent service! - I wasn't very hungry so I split my meal with my brother; courteously, they still gave us a whopping amount of appetizers - Inexpensive prices (comparable to DOWNTOWN Toronto prices; granted, korean food typically isn't as expensive, they've marked it up $1-2, but you're in the heart of Toronto... what do you expect?)  - It's pretty big - if you come in a small party, you'll get a booth. If not, they have tables and chairs for big parties.  - Plays a variety of music (english, chinese, korean...)   Cons: - You're at the mercy of downtown parking (but that's a given if you're in Toronto to begin with)  Given its location, Kimchi Korea House doesn't offer anything exceptional compared to its competitors (literally within 5 minutes walking radius, there are so many other korean restaurants). Nonetheless, thumbs up for amazing service!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of spicy pork bone soup and cute waitresses, this place is a must visit. You will be very satisfied with the spicy level here and the soup base is full of flavor.   You also get a decent amount of meat.  A downside of this place is that they don't really refill their sides for you and they tasted quite average. Overall, this place is worth visiting especially if you are near the eatons centre area."}
{"text":"Korean Kimchi House is located on Dundas St West Toronto. My boyfriend and I had the last dinner in Toronto here. We arrived the restaurant around 5:30 pm. There were lots of people at the restaurant. We had to wait for more than 30 minutes to get the table.  After we got a table, we have ordered TAKOYAKI,  BULGOGI BIBIMBAP, and KIMCHI SOUP + RICE. The food came out very fast. The taste of the food was very delicious. Bulgogi Bibimbap and Kimchi Soup were very authentic. The price of the food was cheap. The servers were very nice and friendly. We enjoyed our last dinner in Toronto Korean Kimchi House."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, paired with great service and ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo yummy, but definitely a little pricier than it's koreatown counterparts. The space is clean and modern, the staff is kind and service is decent. The menu is a little more restrictive, but everything is good.   They do provide the small side dishes at this restaurant, but you only get  a REFILL FOR TWO 0_0. This was weird, as someone who grew up eating Korean food, where all the ajumma are constantly asking for refills, and they are always refilled.   The best dish is the Tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork?). It is fresh, hot and not overly sauced or soggy. The spicy chicken sizzling plate is also really good and it's got a nice kick. All the soups I've had are pretty good too (this is mainly limited to the spicy soups thus far, as they are my favourite); they taste authentic and just like how my grandma makes them (the OG korean food chef! :D)    I will definitely be back to have the sweet and sour pork (as I think it's the best in the city - despite being a small portion than other places), they spicy chicken that my friend loves, and more of their tasty soups!"}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday for the second time I believe as a group of 2. We were told that we had to wait 10-15 mins. After standing around for awhile, the waitress pointed out the seats by the side (she could have notified us earlier?).   We were later seated and ordered a seafood dukbokki to share ($14-15). We had our side dishes refilled once upon request and water was refilled as well. However, the waitress was rather rude as she handed us the bill when we didn't ask for it. We did not sit for that long and they weren't in need of seats. The food tasted alright, decent amount of seafood but also very small pieces... The clams were a bit fishy and had mostly all fallen out so they weren't that fresh. The flavour is your typical spicy gochujang taste. Texture of the dukbokki was pretty nice and chewy. The side dishes were also decent (great potatoes, like most korean restaurants). The bill was around $18 so kind of pricey tbh. We were both full though since rice cakes are filling.   The place is usually quite busy from the looks of it. I guess the environment is a bit nicer but honestly I don't recommend coming here. Service aslo seems to a common issue."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a business trip from the states.  Always love to try Korean in new towns.  This was a pretty good effort.  The ban chan was excellent.  The do a spicy pickled english cucumber that was to die for.  I thought their Kimchi was better than most.  great spice.  Order the stone bowl bibimbap.  I would say it was just OK.  Their selection of toppings was a bit sparse and North Americanized.  Would have enjoyed more authentic vegetables.  Still a nice presentation.  Service was great.  Price was right.  Nice effort."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday and night and they were pretty busy, but I didn't need to wait long for a table. We were pretty close to the table beside us, but the booth area was nice and spacious for groups of 4. The decor inside was really nice and looked very put together.  All of the waitress/waiters I talked to spoke fluent korean and english, so we didn't have a hard time ordering our food. The service was good overall. I japchae and dak galbi on a hot plate and both of them came with black rice. The japchae was delicious but the dak galbi didn't have a lot of red chili paste in it, which had the chicken tasting a little bland.   I would definitely come back here to try other things. Other than that everything was good!"}
{"text":"Classic Korean dishes with a number of fresh Japanese options. The house sake selection is quite nice.  Ask for a booth. It's better than the small front tables."}
{"text":"I got a ramen here but I can't remember which. Despite the thickness of broth and the very yummy smell, it had 0 flavors. It wasn't even slightly salty. I'm never having ramen there again."}
{"text":"I rarely eat out alone. But when I do, I do it by myself.   So here I was all alone (having fun with jury selection) with an empty stomach and an hour Ana a half to spend near the courthouse.   Where to go, what to eat.  Sansotei is always a favourite but I decided to try something new. And wow!    This place is great!    It was clean, with fast and very pleasant service.   I ordered the pork bibimbop. It was one of the best ones I have had. Even for this one person they brought the Korean appetizer sampler and threw in a miso soup. But really the star of the show was the bibimbop. Sweet, savoury, with tons of textures and flavour and a nice bite. The stone bowl made sure everything was perfectly hot through the whole meal.   Price wise, the lunch, with only a water and taxes was just under $20. Not the cheapest but well worth it.   I will come back here. I suggest you give them a try too.   Ps. Only reason for not 5 stars is that this was my first and I ate alone. I like to see a variety of dishes prior to giving 5 stars now. I'm getting older and more mature in my ratings. :)"}
{"text":"We got the side dishes which included kimchi, bean sprouts, Chinese broccoli and potatoes. I really liked the kimchi and bean sprouts and the other two I didn't care for.  But I really was disappointed that the pickled daikon was left out.   Then we got our salads. The salad came dressed with a homemade mayonnaise. Although it didn't taste bad I didn't feel that it fit into a Korean menu.  I ordered the bulgogi mushroom stew which came with sticky rice. The stew wasn't that bad. My only complaint was that it was slightly too sweet.  I would say this place is below mediocre when it comes to Korean food. I think they are understaffed in the front of the house. We got our food fairly quickly too."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to get Korean food! They've got really good appetizer dishes and on top of that their stone rice is amazing.   They've got really good service there too. One waitress is incredibly cute like she was at least an 8!!!!  Well if u like Korean food or chicks, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Went again for lunch on Friday.  This place just is amazing!!!  Food is always fresh and so so good."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 3.5/5.   This is my usual work lunch Korean restaurant as there aren't many around Eaton Centre area. The lunch crowd is usually super busy, if we have a big group (4+) we will definitely make reservations.   I've tried their pork bone soup (good and spicy) and mainly bulgogi bibimbap with egg. Their bibimbap is pretty good but the one thing I noticed lately is that their portions decreased in size. They used to have pretty big portions and the price is a little pricey for what I'm used to. I definitely recommend bulgogi bibimbap. I tried chicken bibimbap the other day and because it's chicken breast (like the kind they use for their bento boxes or chicken teriyaki), it was a little dry. The beef compliments the rice a lot more.   Lunch for me came up to $15 just after adding the egg and tax before tip. Pretty expensive for Korean but for the location, don't really have a choice but here. If I had an option, I wouldn't come here since there is better value elsewhere.   Ps. They only refill 2 out of 5 side dishes if you ask. That is their max. But they do serve you cold tofu before your meal comes."}
{"text":"Was in the area and craving Korean food, this place seemed like a solid decision.    The banchan were very average, nothing stood out.  I order the bulgogi bibimap.  The dish itself was good, the rice developed a nice crust, which is my favorite part of the dish.  I just wished they served it with an egg.  Service was a bit slow, but friendly."}
{"text":"My cousin and I each ordered a pork bibimbap. I was surprised at how much meat was in it!! There were many pieces of thinly sliced, fatty pork belly. I added hot sauce and soya sauce and it was pretty good. We also shared a kimchi pancake and spicy beef rice cake (with no fish cake). I wonder if they gave us more rice cake since we asked for no fish cake. Don't know because it wsd our first time there (my cousin is allergic to seafood). The kimchi pancake was huge, like a frozen pizza! It was something unique. A little crispy but a bit too much of a dry thing to eat for 2 people. I prefer okonomiyaki because it has sauce making it easier to go down. The rice cakes were expensive at $14 before tax for a small appetizer amount. But I think they may be ny new favourite all star for Korean rice cakes. I love rice cakes so much, I get it every chance I get at every Korean restaurant and supermarket. I really enjoy hmart (my go to) for both the taste and price, however, the sauce at this location was spicy, thick, rich, a nice amount of veggies/meat, and the rice cakes were HUGE and so soft!!! Would highly recommend this dish to anyone that enjoys Korean rice cake. All the complimentary appetizers were also super delicious. I enjoyed all of them! The bill for 2 people came up to over $60 after tax and tip for weekday lunch."}
{"text":"The worst worst experience ever! Even makes me to write my first review on Yelp. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The food there is not bad. But their service is horrible.   When I finished it, they cleared my table immediately and asked me to pay it. They didn't even let me take a rest there. And then I ordered something else and wanted to have it there. But they just wrapped it and expected me to leave immediately.   I was so disappointed by their service and won't come back anymore."}
{"text":"Extremely surprised this restaurant had only 3.5 star rating. It might be because of the language barrier but honestly being Korean myself, one of the best Korean restaurants I have ever been to.   Went a little bit past the busiest time 7:30pm. Was seated literally within 1 second of entering the place, was confused as to if the server was directing us to our seats. Washroom was super clean, service was great (no language barrier), and food was excellent.  I had the gamjatang, pork bone stew (spicy) which was filled with meat. Clean flavour throughout the broth and meat. Very flavourful and perfect to taste. Never had that much meat in this specific dish... ever! My girlfriend got the bulgogi stew. Which was also great. Side dishes were all refilled, all 6, even though we were only allowed two refils, the server saw us devour those side dishes.  Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The Spicy Pork bone soup smelled like they added pig's urine! Awful! The waitress did not know that the soup is traditionally made with pork neck. Go to touhenboku ramen on Queen St W instead."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular haunts when I'm in Toronto. Small Korean family owned restaurant. Great food, fantastic service. Their Bibinbap rocks. The kimchi is amazing and the staff are really friendly. If you get a chance, drag the owner of the restaurant into a conversation. She is the best. Will sit at your table and tell you about the food you're eating. 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"My fav Korean restaurant near eaton centre, they have so many choices for bibimbap and they serve it with dark rice!    I had chicken bibimbap with egg and I thought the portion is small at first, however, I found the ratio of each ingredient is perfect and I ended up full. Not like other Korean places, the chicken is even larger than rice!  The appetizer is great, I pulled all small dishes in to my hot stone bowl and the taste is even better!"}
{"text":"My go to pork bone soup place in the area. The spicy pork bone soup is flavourful and fall off the bone. Comes with the usual 6side dishes of potatoes, noodles, kimchi, cucumber, bean sprouts and cabbage. Lunch time crowd arrives at noon so arrive early and avoid line ups"}
{"text":"While the food tasted okay - I ordered the spicy pork bibimbap - I did not feel well the rest of the day and the next morning it was quite clear that I had some type of food poisoning. I am very lucky that I did not have to go to work the next day but unlucky that I had an interview scheduled. Somehow, I made it through the 2-hour interview without having to run to the bathroom. I have eaten almost everywhere in the area and this is the first time this has happened. Never even happened with the cheap Korean food in the Grange. Clearly, not following proper food handling. I am currently in pain."}
{"text":"All around solid Korean restaurant, where the food is comforting and the service is friendly. This is a good alternative if koreatown along Bloor is too far of a walk. It can sometimes be quite busy, but they're very fast and you'll be seated in no time. The soft tofu soup is very spicy - I recommend you opt for the mild option. The salmon bimbimbap is a little underwhelming, get the tempura bento box instead."}
{"text":"After wandering around Yonge/Dundas area for a spot to eat, we settled for Kimchi Korea House. The place was almost full - luckily there was a table open for us.   The service was decent: we were greeted by the front staff who immediately had us seated. There wasn't much interaction with our waiter and sometimes we had to waive down another waiter.   The food was mediocre, given the price. My friend ordered the Spicy Beef Soup and noticed there was barely any beef. I ordered the Tofu Bibimbap which was decent... nothing I would rave about coming back for. The side dishes (which you can only reorder a limit of two) made up for the lack of flavour and portions of the mains."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: dimly-lit, updated neutral-palette decor with techno music playing in the background? (maybe this is unique to dinner seating) The interior is nothing to rant-and-rave about but the restaurant is clean and comfortable. The restaurant was filled with customers - a tell-tale positive sign.   Staff and service: quick service, pleasant staff.   Food and drink: I ordered the seaweed salad to start and the Regular Bibimbap - touted as their most popular - with extra egg (see attached picture) to finish. The seaweed salad was fresh and garnished with (imitation?) crab - no complaints. The bibimbap was exceptionally well-done and, probably its most memorable feature, served with 6 mixing sides that you might find scattered throughout a Korean restaurant (+++ points for the excellent Kimchi).  Overall impression: I would highly recommend Kimchi Korea house as an affordable option for quick and delicious Korean food."}
{"text":"Get the pork bone get the pork bone..one more time get the pork bone!! Wow this stuff is awesomely Good. The pork just falls off and swims in cheery saucy chili broth. One freaking potato in the bottom. They even give you a bowl for the bones.  Service is ok. Very quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place as it was near the greyhound station and I was craving Korean food. I was definitely not disappointed First of all, they give you 6!!! Side dishes including potatoes, which already leaves me with a very good impression I ordered their pork dolsot bibimbap. My worries that it would be too flavourless were unfounded since the flavours were amazing. The pork belly slices were thin but plentiful, and VERY well flavoured. The rice was delicious, with the right amount of spiciness for my palette, and very savoury. The hints of picked radish blended perfectly with the taste. It's my favourite bowl of bibimbap to this day, regular beef bulgogi bibimbap cannot measure up to this. My friend got the gamjatang and really enjoyed it as well I will be back once I'm in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Great option for very affordable and well portioned Korean food. We came around 6:30pm on a weekday. Looked packed but we were able to get a table right away. The food is nothing extraordinary but for 13 bucks it was great value."}
{"text":"We dropped in here for lunch. Food was not bad, but not great. I think I've tried a bunch of Korean restaurants now and this was satisfy for lunch, but nothing memorable.          We ordered two of the bibimbap bowls. I had one with eel, meat was good. The portions were small, not many vegetables and I really like that burnt crispy rice you get on the bottom of the stone bowl. Somehow this bowl didn't have that and I understood that to be one of the signatures of this type of dish. The meal came with lots of the cold side dishes I'm use to in Korean Restaurants, so no complaints there.  My wife had the vegetable bibimbap with no complaints I think. We ordered a couple of unique non-alcoholic drinks but they where pretty disappointing. Mine tasted like the candy cinnamon hearts, definitely got too much spice. The drinks were definitely not worth it.          The service was so-so. The waiter was friendly enough and answered questions about the menu but wasn't vert attentive after we ordered. A couple of times we would have liked to grab him for a request but he and a couple others kept sailing by the table, more or less on their own schedule. They were good to refill water glasses.          Its an attractive and clean interior with good seating. So its a good spot to spend a little time with your friends in that regard. They are also licensed for alcohol and carry Korean beers (I think).         Conclusion, decent food, nothing special, a bit on a the pricey side."}
{"text":"My first time at a Korean restaurant. Our server was very helpful going over the menu and talking about the traditional food. VERY good food! The place is clean and has a good ambience."}
{"text":"Had great food and good appetizers. I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't ever had Korean  food. I highly recommend the noodles."}
{"text":"I had lunch here this Sunday after a power shop with family.  Although the food wasn't mind blowing, everything we had was completely satisfying.  We shared some gyoza for our starter and they were deep fried to perfection.  Then we enjoyed the various standard Korean side dishes that came with our meal, each one fully identified and explained by our server even though we were all familiar with them.  No harm though.  For my main I had Dolsot bulgogi bibimbap and I thought it was pretty good though it was missing some of the ingredients I am used to having in this dish such as spinach and egg.  Instead there was a lot of corn in this restaurant's version.  A tad weird, but any way, it tasted good enough.  The best thing about this place was the service.  Everyone was super nice though we were mistaken twice for \"out of towners\".  As a Torontonian born and bred, my pride was a little damaged, but I sucked it up because the staff were well meaning and very attentive."}
{"text":"My go to korean food whenever I'm downtown! The food here is your average korean restaurant food, not too good, not too bad. However I really enjoy their bibimbap as they have a variety of them! Side dishes are good and also refillable, really love the extra tofu side dish they serve. Lunch deals are pretty nice as well, especially the bentos. Portions however are a little smaller than other places. Service is really quick and the waitresses are polite.  Location is really convenient being in downtown core, which is probably one of the main reasons why I go. The seating space is a bit tight but all in all is a nice place to grab some quick food with friends or by yourself!"}
{"text":"Good pork bone soup and decent service except for the end where we were waiting for a while to get change."}
{"text":"Clean brand new place, although soulless till now (add some paintings or art on the wall), with nice staff, but I was not impressed at all by the menu and the food. I am not a big fan or expert in Korean food in general but everything here tasted quite bland, the seafood was too chewy (almost not edible). Tempura was OK but basic. Beef ribs were cooked correctly but also overall bland. Just explain to me why this place's logo is a chili if everything tastes bland.  Need to work on the menu and have some more originality and home made food (rather than frozen-unfrozen-microwaved dishes).  PS: I went there because the newly opened Santosei ramen one block East was \"sold out\" (closed because no food left!!!) on a Tuesday evening at 7:30PM!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Kimchi Korea House for a date and I had a typical good experience. The atmosphere and food had an authentic vibe to it. I enjoyed how the serving size was well worth the price point. The service and food was OK but nothing really stood out for me that would encourage me to come again."}
{"text":"Around Eaton centre there are some restaurants from many countries. It was very cold and made us need a hot soup to cover our body. Then, we decided to go to Korean restaurant near there.  When I look at the menu, i see that the price is kind of high, my friend said that because here is downtown. Okei, accept it! They serve the food kind of fast, dont need to wait too long. If u require for hot tea, u will pay more 1$, and can refill it.  My friend order pork bone soup, what she didnt like is too oily, it is not good for health. Mine is spicy beef soup extra spicy but still not spicy for me hahaa. Another friend order beef veggie soup with grass noodle inside and he loved it.  The banchan is good, can refill for free if u want more. That is what i like from korean restaurant.  The space here is not too big not too small. But its kind of dark, make me feel sleepy :)))."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for a Korean restaurant, this place really does get packed at night. I come here during the afternoon because I was craving bimbim naengmyeon and this was nearby. I found it really expensive, after tax and tips came it being $20. But in all honestly, it was one of the best bimbim naengmyeon I have ever had. The side dishes were really good but there are no full refills with them, they let me pick 3 to get refilled. Second time I went was during a Friday night and there was a queue and so my friend and I waited for approx 20 minutes. I ordered the bimbimbap and it was okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Standard Korean resto at slightly higher prices (otherwise 3-STARS!).  Located down the street from 12 o' Lunch and Sansotei, this recently opened Korean resto offers your standard rice bowls, stews and kim chi. The booth-style layout seats plenty of people but I wished they had a ringer to notify your server like they do in other places.  They're generous with their kim chi dishes, which is a plus, but their main dishes are generally $2-3 more than the local competition. I've tried their DOLSOP BIBIMBAP and various STEWS, which, while not bad, don't seem as flavourful as other places. Granted, there's not a lot of choices within walking distance, but I prefer 12 o' Lunch's BIBIMBAP. Otherwise, head to Chinatown or the Annex (aka South Korea) for more options such as Owl of Minerva, Bak Chang Dong Soon, Joons or Korean Village Restaurant."}
{"text":"went here with a friend who loves this place and raved about it. I went in around 11:30 to get us a table. Place gets super busy around 12pm so come before that. She ordered a regular bibimbap and i ordered the bulogi.  The accompaning sides were in abundance. Which is probably my favorite part of this meal. Service was also really quick and friendly and waitresses always came by to see if we needed anything or any tops up. A+ for service.  The sides were also really yummy (esp the noodles). Our meals came with salad and soup as well which we didnt touch as we already had sooo much food on the table. My main thing with the bibimbap was that although it was very tasty it was missing two big items for me and the main reason why i ordered bibimbap. 1) the egg.... no egg?? what the .... 2) no ccrunchy bottom!?!? Bay far the best bibimbap was at Bapbo just down the street. Super crunchy bottom, lots of hot sauce, lots of meat and AN EGG. However.... the sides werent that substantial or delicious at bapbo...nor the service. So im a bit torn here. I will have to come back again to see if this place can get a 4. Lunch for two after tax and tip was 25.00 - good value for walking out extremelly full."}
{"text":"--- Food --- The pork bone soup is decent. Costed ~$12. I liked how it came with multigrain (purple/black) rice. The soup base was pretty good. The meat could have been a bit more tender.  My friend ordered the seafood fish cake. The waitress asked if she wants cheese, she said yes. Who knew that it would cost an extra $4? That's a little ridiculous for fish cake with cheese for $20.   --- Atmosphere---  Service was good.  Young pretty waitresses were friendly.   --- Summary --- The food is alright, I'll likely try elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I come here quite often with my girlfriend (we live in the area), and we definitely feel like the reviews that Kimchi House has gotten are not deserved. It is a little better than other Yelpers have rated it (in our opinion at least). I usually order the pork bone soup ($8), which usually comes with a large portion of pork bone and is enough to fill me for a couple hours (and I'm a pretty big eater). I have also had the bulgolgi (which could be better), and the dolsot bimbimbap - which is also good. They also bring an assortment of side dishes, which are all good (if you ask - you might event get some of their delicious fried potatoes. Mmmm...).  If you're looking for a clean restaurant with good service that is reasonably priced - definitely check out Kimchi House. Bapbo across the street is much more expensive (with poorer service) - though the quality of food is a little better at Bapbo."}
{"text":"I have been to many Korean restaurants. Always a fan of Korean foods because of those Korean shows.   However, this one is the worst I have ever been. The food is more expensive than other Korean restaurant. We ordered bibimbap. As a tradition, bibimbap always come with a boiled egg. But this restaurant ask for extra money for the egg. It is not expensive to add one, but it makes you feel not so good.  Plus you can only add three sides. And the portion of sides is very very little. If you don't ask the waiter, once your table have little space, they would just take away all the sides even if you didn't finish without asking.  Will not go again."}
{"text":"I randomly decided to try this place with a friend and thought it was okay. Didn't have to wait to get a seat on a Saturday night, unlike Japango and Sansotei (other places we tried first before we came here). This place is pretty big, although in the area we were sitting, the tables were all placed really close together - made it difficult to get up and leave without disturbing or bumping into your neighbours' table.  In general the food was pretty good, and I left quite satisfied and full. We even had leftovers to go. We ordered the sweet and sour pork and jap-chae noodles with beef. The sweet and sour pork was pretty interesting, maybe this is just like the typical Korean version of it? But it wasn't the red sweet and sour sauce I was expecting, it was a lighter, yellow version that had a citrusy taste, and I liked it! Jap-chae was also pretty good, although the beef in it was a bit dry.  Service was a little less attentive than I would have liked, maybe because we were sitting kind of in the corner by the window, but maybe that's just the way they do things here. I did like that they gave us a lot of side dishes though, and a wide variety. I wouldn't mind coming to this place again if I happen to be in the area and need a quick bite to eat, but wouldn't make a trip specifically for it."}
{"text":"Went two times. Expensive for mediocre food(main and side). Good service but I go to restaurants for food."}
{"text":"This place is a gigantic joke. The staff were bunch of buffoons with funny outfit. They know nothing about restaurant business. They only served their buddies while I was waiting for someone to take my order. Make the long story short, I am now at Yutaka waiting for my food. The star above was awarded for its location."}
{"text":"The restaurant is conveniently located on Dundas street which I really liked. I've eaten here multiple times before and it had always been relatively pleasant.   My complaint is about my experience there today with a particular male staff. Prior to paying, I (I specifically, but not my Caucasian friend,) was asked whether I am Korean - completely out of the blue. I answered that I do speak the language but I am not Korean. Immediately after, he said, \"We won't accept cards for under $50\".   I was given no explanation whatsoever as to why he asked for my nationality. He had not make any small talk with my guy friend and I prior to us paying. I couldn't help but assumed that somehow there was a connection between my nationality and ... my method of payment? I am still quite confused and bothered about the situation and I wonder what could have been different if I was, Korean, whether I would have given another option or received different treatment.   I for one believe that it was questionable for the waiter to have abruptly asked for my nationality right before I paid. And if that had in any way affected the options I'd been offered or my treatment, it is highly inappropriate. Will not be visiting again any time soon."}
{"text":"This place was something that my friend and I originally overlooked - we really wanted Korean BBQ (at 10pm, I know....), but we decided to come in and ask how late the place was open to look at our options. We made it in time for last call and the server actually convinced us to stay, even though there was no BBQ. We thought some Korean food at the end of the night would still suffice. We left absolutely happy and completely satisfied with our meal and experience.  First off, the atmosphere of the restaurant was actually very casual yet friendly. It was a medium sized restaurant that also had private areas to them. We were seated by the window and I still felt like we had a great deal of privacy at the same time.  The price of the food was not too horrible either - a decent price for the quality of the food we bought. Forgive me if I spell anything wrong, but my friend and I split a small hot sake, bulgogi bibimbap, L.A. ribs, and two sweet drinks: Ginger and rice (I believe?) and a cinnamon one,  which I had never tried before. With our meal we get delicious side dishes as well as miso soup, which was excellent. Overall, we spent about $60 which was not too horrible for us - of course, we did split the food. The overall taste of the food was absolutely delicious and pretty high up there in favorites of Korean restaurants, even with NY Korea Town places.  Although, the main reason why I absolutely had one of the best experiences here was the service I was given. As soon as we walked in, the server convinced us to stay even though it was last call. I hate coming in for last call because I don't like to inconvenience the workers, but he made us feel right at ease and we decided to stay. My friend and I like to joke around and poke fun at each other and the server played right into our antics and immediately felt like a friend. It was not something that felt forced - it felt absolutely genuine. The other ladies there were all absolutely pleasant and made sure that we were always comfortable, that we were having a good time, and always had a smile on their faces. I am absolutely used to being rushed out of a place, or given such fake smiles and demeanors. This service was absolutely refreshing and it really did feel like a place full of friends.  I do have to give a shout out to our server, Tyler, for being such an absolute sport with EVERYTHING that we said and did. He rolled with the punches, gave wonderful recommendations, and helped us when one of us could not figure out how to use the machine  for our cards. He made us feel so welcomed and we felt like we left at our own pace - he treats the customers like people he wants to truly get to know. I would absolutely go back there just for the wonderful service again. No hesitation."}
{"text":"Best pork bone soup ever! My go to Korean place in downtown area. Great service and nice ambience too"}
{"text":"Right in the heart of downtown situated Kimchi House.  At 5pm on a Friday night there were already quite a few diners.  My friend frequents this place, so I left it to him to order for me.  A bottle of soju to share, and a platter of pork slices to accompany the drink.  We also ordered the rib soup as well.  All in all, there were plenty of food with a bit left over. The food came pretty fast.  We asked for 2 bowls but they forgot to bring them to us.  So we had to ask again.  But no big deal. It was a pleasant experience.  Would come again for sure."}
{"text":"I went with a friend yesterday, as she had heard and saw a new korean restaurant had opened up on Dundas so we decided to try it out!  The Bon Chon was a normal variety though I did like the pickled radish a bit but the salad that was complimentary was okay.  But I was a bit disappointed with our appetizer,  we had gotten the Takoyaki, and at $7.50 it was a bit pricey especially since it was the frozen premade microwavable type that can be bought for around $10 a bag full.  HOWEVER the reason why I rating it 4/5 is because the Kimchi Chigae that I had ordered was fabulous. It had the right amount of seasoning and tasted great! The rice was also nice and fluffy, and though my friend had ordered the Kimchi pancake we both agreed it was the Kimchi Chigae that was worth coming back for.   So if anything I recommend people go there just for the Kimchi Chigae!  I think their Kimchi Chigae was even better than some of the other Kimchi Chigae's I had tried on Bloor in K-town.  Also the free wifi was a cool plus!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and I like it. I enjoy the banchans and while the service can sometimes be slow, they are generally nice enough. My banchans never get refilled but the portions (and my order choices, in general) provide me with plenty of food so it's not a problem.  The food is on the pricey side for Korean food but given the location, I can understand. I think their tempura is great value - though I wish they'd give you more dipping sauce and in a larger container. I've never been disappointed with their bibimbaps. I love that they serve them in the hot stone bowls that actually can make your rice crispy at the end if you smush it into the bowl as you eat. The gochujang sauce is tasty without being too spicy (for me - and I'm a lightweight when it comes to spice). Would love to try their bossam one day if I can round up enough people to come with me.   I've come here a few times when I wanted to go to Japango for their cold soba with tempura but either the restaurant had a ridiculous wait or I didn't want to shell out that kind of money (because Japango is even pricier than here). Never been disappointed!  Tip: The regular bibimbap actually does come with meat - the menu makes it look like there's no beef, but there is. I think it's adequate and tasty, which is why I don't think the bulgogi bibimbap is really worth the premium price. (Also, I feel there's too much meat in it.) It's nice that you can add cheese to the bibimbaps too, if you're feeling extra decadent! But be aware that it's basically shredded mozzarella, which provides a lot of nice richness and gooeyness but doesn't contribute much flavour."}
{"text":"Inside of the restaurant looks great. Fast service friendly staff. But most importantly, their food is f-ing delicious! Everything looks great and fresh. Food porn at its finest. Everything on the menu looks amazing. I had bulgogi mushroom stew... Amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always had ordered the pork bone soup. Affordable, filling, and delicious. This time I had the seafood tofu stew. Spicy and tasty but I had better. I will stick with the pork bone soup when I visit this place again."}
{"text":"I liked their Korean apps (kimchi, potatoes..). We kept finishing them and asking for more!  I'm not sure if it was the waiter's fault? He was always there and answered our requests, but WHO is fulfilling them? Because our apps didn't come as often as we've asked. Our waiter was very nice though!  The food was decent, I had a some kind of bibimbap that I liked. No problems finishing this! Really full for the day!! So I got back to the office wanting to sleep..  Served in a stone pot, the bibimbap was super hot with lots of meat. I've had better bibimbap elsewhere though, and my favourite tends to have LOTS of food!! Kimchi Korea House's bibimbap was just average, still tasty.  There wasn't a wait at 1pm lunch Thursday for two. I liked their decor and table setup: the booths, the intimate 2-person tables... this place has a second room for larger parties!"}
{"text":"Overall had a terrible experience. Imagine going to a Korean restaurant and being served Chinese food. The bulgolgi was practically chinese food, the dangjangchigae was water, a major disappointment. Where's the Korean flavor? Not here."}
{"text":"Agreed with the majority of reviewers - save yourself the time/money and go somewhere else. This place is actually quite large and was packed during my lunch meet with a friend, but I won't be returning here anytime when there's so many more options along Dundas.   In short, the dolsoht bibimbap was subpar but costs more than most places. They are probably trying to turn dishes as quickly as possible during lunch, but my stone bowl wasn't nearly hot enough and the rice on the bottom ended up being an oily soggy mess."}
