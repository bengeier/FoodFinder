{"text":"The food was delicious! Marco, the server, was well versed in the menu and restaurant. Overall an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken, fried green tomatoes and slaw. But the mac and cheese was awesome homemade all the way. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I wasn't very impressed with the decor of the place but the waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food! Now the food was the bomb!!! Both my date and I were extremely pleased with our meal. My date had the fried chicken and red velvet waffles. He said it was delicious! Chicken seasoned well and the waffles so good! I had the Bourbon Street Pasta! So good! Large shrimp and pieces of lobster! Fantastic! We were so full. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I was excited, as always to support a local black owned business. This restaurant was reminiscent of many of the \"soul food\" restaurants in and around Cleveland. The staff and chef were very friendly and seemed excited about expansion..which was literally happening while I dined. I was a bit disappointed about their lack of vegetarian options. The red velvet waffles were gorgeous little bits of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Whenever I see shrimp and grits on any menu, I order it. Southern Cafe has the best shrimp and grits I've ever ordered in Cleveland! So buttery! I also got a side of candied yams which was a nice balanced meal of salty and sweet. My sister ordered the chicken and waffles and was also pleased. I was surprised how empty it was on a Saturday around 11:30 am. Lots of take-out orders going out though. The server assured us that on Sundays, around the same time, it's packed. They stop serving breakfast on Saturday at 11:00."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I enjoyed the quick drive from Cleveland Heights to http://www.southerncafeohio.com- I thought it would take forever. The location felt like any storefront in the Nation's Capital, and dropping a few quarters in the meter really made it feel like home.   Our group of 6 were seated comfortably in the expanded http://www.southerncafeohio.com, and Dillon, our server made us feel right at home, as did Chef Tony Fortuner who swung by to say, \"Hello, and Thank you for joining us\". Must haves:   - Soul Rolls  - Smoked Pork Chops  - Greens - Baked Macaroni and Cheese - top it off with Jolly Rancher or Purple Rain \" Kool-aid\"  You will enjoy this great Food for the Soul."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Me and my girlfriend went there for the first time today and we will be back at least weekly. It's hard to find good grits or Mac and cheese at a restaurant, but this place has it down packed."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fried perch w/ yams and fried cabbage. The perch was seasoned and fried perfectly. The yams were out of this world, Thanksgiving day worthy. The fried cabbage was oh so good. I crumbled my corn muffin into it and went to town!! I thought my southern grandma was in that kitchen! Note: if you are dining in, never do so on a hot summer day as there is no air conditioning! I sweated profusely, but the joy of my food made up for it! Get the Peach Cobbler it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Our first soul cafe we have visited and boy was it amazing! The food was authentic and comforting--- we especially enjoyed the \"soul rolls.\" The restaurant itself is very relaxing and a good place for a date or even a larger group. Our service was top notch as well. Definitely one of the best restaurants in #CLE"}
{"text":"Amazing. From the time we walked in the staff were accommodating. I had the grilled pork-chop with Mac&cheese and collard greens. Everything came out timely and was great to taste. I'll be back. Ask for Marco."}
{"text":"Went for lunch while in Cleveland for the first time ever from MYRTLE BEACH SOUTH CAROLINA. The restaurant isn't very big .soon as my wife and I walk in we were greeted by CATHY who  is very pleasant she took our drink order right  away I had the purple rain lemonade, my wife the tea which both were very good for lunch I ordered the smothered pork chop with rice and Mac n cheese . My wife had grill chicken breast cabbage and rice the food was really good and the cornbread was delicious . Cathy  service was really Great on top of that we ask for directions how to get downtown she hand wrote the directions which were perfect and put the restaurant number on the paper in case we got lost . Which we didn't we will eat there again for sure"}
{"text":"Everything about Southern Cafe is amazing. Our waitress, Nyssa, was extraordinarily knowledgeable and welcoming. We got the fried green tomatoes, catfish bites, and soul roles to start out with. All of which were out of this world. For our main course, we got the chicken with Mac and cheese and potatoes and okra. It was all delicious. You can taste the love with every bite. I will surely be back again and advise anyone who hasn't gone to do so. It will not disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went for dinner last night and lunch today. its a breathe of fresh air to the westside. The greens and mac and cheese remind me of my grandmothers! the waitress was so cute and sweet! i will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I have been in twice and have tried several dishes. Although I am not a southern or soul food expert, I would like to say, bravo. I truly enjoyed everything. 1. Blackened Chicken Sandwich, juicy and that sauce. Next time I will ask for extra blackening seasoning, cause I like it hot. 2. Fried Green Tomato BLT was a twist on a classic. 3. The Fried Green Tomato was the second time in my life trying this southern tradition. I enjoy this version more than my first - this had a smoother battered texture vs. the first try on the Eastside which had a very pronounced corn meal texture. 4. Bread Pudding took two sittings to finish. I might try the Peach Cobbler and Shrimp and Grits on my  next visit or the Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place today for the first time. I had the bourbon street pasta. It was amazing flavor with a little spice but not overbearing. You could taste the shrimp and lobster in every bite. My husband had the fried catfish which was also amazing especially with the hot sauce. I def was impressed and 100% would come back again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Go here.  Found this place accidentally. So glad I did. AND... They deliver!!!  Authentic low country food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared the catfish po' boy with whiskey BBQ sauce and cole slaw on Texas toast. It was so damn good, I just stared at it with every bite!  We also got the fried green tomato BLT , mac & cheese , and okra...all of it was EXCELLENT! Service was prompt and charming. Chill music playing in the background and a nice clean restroom. The room next to it seems to be under construction preparing for booth seating. They deliver within a 2 mile radius. I see this restaurant doing very well, and becoming a local mainstay. I'm already looking forward to checking out the other dishes on Southern Cafe's menu!"}
{"text":"I drove my family members over to Lakewood from University Heights, and it was well worth the trip! Taking 90W to 2 made it a quick ride! My mom and her 3 SOUL FOOD COOKING sisters ABSOLUTELY LOVED their visit to Southern Cafe! The sisters raved about the Soul Rolls, Fried Green Tomatoes, and your  fried chicken. They thought the side dishes were delicious, too! Thanks for making my aunt's birthday very memorable!"}
{"text":"My goodness. I should've checked the back to see if my Granny was in the kitchen cooking bc this food right here?! This food right here?!? *in my Kat Williams voice*  Look, I wanted to find the best soulfood in the city, so I hopped on Yelp and was directed here. I got in a little after they opened, around 11:45 and was able to pick my seat. There were so many delicious looking options on the menu, I didn't know what to choose. Being torn between the shrimp and grits (which I was told is appetizer that can also be as filling as an entree) and the chicken and red velvet waffles with grits, I went ahead with the chicken.  While waiting, I ordered a purple rain, which was a mix of grape and lemonade kool aid. Yes! Kool aid is on the menu! Chyleeeee listen........  My food was out in like 15 mins, if that and it looked wonderful. I dove in head first. Good god almighty. Waffles were cooked perfectly and didn't have an overwhelming red velvet taste, chicken - you can tell it marinates and is fried just right. The grits - lots of people mess grits up..... not here. I asked for butter with my grits and my waiter brought it out but it was not needed at all! Nothing needed to be touched. I inhaled everything. I only wish I had more room to have tried one of the deserts.   The service was great. The waiter was very attentive to everyone and had a very warm personality.  The table down from me had a delicious looking smorgasbord going on as well! I saw greens, chicken, mac n cheese, and there were nice full portions of it all.  This place just shut down every soulfood spot in Chicago with no hesitation. I was even told that they should be opening up another location soon.   Get there!!! You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a store front cafe with the best southern food We have had in years! I took my husband and family for his birthday. Out of all my gifts over the years, because of the response to the food this seemed to be the best gift ever. The food was excellent and the service was superb!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food. Came in on a Sunday at noon. Started with the Cleveland egg rolls, which were like southwestern chicken egg rolls. Outstanding!    I ordered the Perch with fries and Mac and cheese. A bit disappointed as the fries were not fresh cut, but crinkle fries. The perch was good, nice small pieces of lake perch, but the breading was a bit heavier than I would have preferred.   The girls had omelettes and French toast. All was good. Coffee is big, tastes OK, but not outstanding.   Cash only."}
{"text":"Visiting for Work and my coworker and I wanted the closest thing to a home cooked meal we could find and this definitely hit the spot. Glad we came!"}
{"text":"Chicken was burnt, small, and had no flavor... except burnt. Macaroni and cheese was more burnt pieces than macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"All I can say is I am happy that a place like this has come to the Westside of Cleveland. I do not like going to the Eastside for anything, it's such a horrifying experience. To have something so pleasant, so close to home I love it. The food is amazing, the Chiefs need to be commended for a wonderful job well done. I see them expanding to a larger place very soon."}
{"text":"What a find!  I lived in the south for a few years. I miss my comfort food: fried green tomatoes, fried catfish and fried chicken. Southern Cafe has it all.  I love it!  By the way, it is next to NTB Tires."}
{"text":"I came with friends on a Saturday evening and the wait was not very long at all(~10 minutes) The service was amazing and the food was flavorful and delicious. I had the pork chop with Mac and cheese and collard greens. The portions were very filling. Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my food whether I either dine in or takeout. And this time, I had great service from Lonnie. He made sure to check up on me. I recommend for anyone looking for a good home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere! Tried the famous chicken and waffles which were delicious! Now I'm about to try the shrimp and grits and the fried catfish with mac and cheese and collard greens"}
{"text":"I've  been here for the breakfast. Much better than I expected.  Good service,  even better Kool aid.  Chicken and waffles get 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I thought the fried catfish was the best thing I had had there. Then I thought the fried chicken was the best thing I had had there.  Then I had the catfish blackened.  Everything I have is better than the last thing. Every side I've had has been excellent. Mac and cheese? Great. House potatoes? Great. Candied yams? Great. I could go on, but let's just get to the fried cabbage. You think you know cabbage? You have no idea.  I wish I was a magician, except when I did the never ending scarf mouth pull trick, I'd change it up. I'd have it be an endless chain of fried cabbage right down my gullet. Forever and ever.   Not crazy about the cornbread, but I'm not a jalapeño guy. Maybe there's a pepper free option, I've never asked.   Soda is in cans. Can't go wrong there, but have to ration it out accordingly due to avoid refill."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  Just tried a plethora of goodies via takeout and enjoyed it.   Soul Rolls - Full of flavor and very delicious.    Chix Philly Quesadilla - very good dish. Tasty, good portion.   Fried Green Tomato BLT - very good.  Tomatoes were seasoned well. Bacon was great.  Sauces were yummy and complimentary.    Chicken Snack Pack (dark meat) - spices and flavor were great. Might have been a tad bit overdone for my likes tho.   Side of House Potatoes - delicious. Well seasoned. Great flavor. Definitely wanted more!   Side of Red Beans and Rice - needed more seasoning.  Tad bit on the bland side. Added salt and pepper and was pretty good. Could be better.   Side of House Rice - Boring. Bland.  Barely any seasoning.  Well prepared and I liked the veggies, but definitely needs more flavor, please."}
{"text":"I had a craving for some down home cooking and didn't feel like being the one to do the cooking lol. I had my Eye on southern cafe for a while so I figured it was \"about that time.\" I got there and it was pretty quiet but they must have gotten their rush by the end of our meal cuz it was packed.  Me, my friend and his son all got Kool aid for our Sonos which came in a clean mason jar. I got the purple rain flavor,  which was delicious!! It had been to long since I hag a good glass of Kool aid.  I then scanned the menu, which is easy to read and not overwhelming. I went with the perch dinner with greens andred beans and rice as my 2 sides.  Everything came out in decent timing and was delicious except the greens. The greens were so bland even after I added salt, pepper, and hot sauce.  Very disappointing on that but at the least the perch, beans and rice made up for it.  I tried my friends fried green tomatoes and it was delicious! Will return again!"}
{"text":"This was just ok. We ordered the fried green tomatoes and the catfish fingers as appetizers. Those were very good! I can't tell you our waitress name because she mumbled it. We both ordered the fried chicken dinner. Fresh out of the grease! I accidentally dropped my knife. The waitress took it from me and then she asked if I wanted her to get me another one...hell yeah I would like another!!! Duh! I sent my order of collard greens back because they tasted like a 5 pound bag of sugar had been dumped in them. I dealt with the rice and beans...but I've never had them with sweet peas inside...Oh well...that kool-aid has definitely given me diabetes and cavities....my daughter added water to hers.....hmmm...to go back or not is the question.....I might."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place the food is amazing is definitely a must try I had the catfish and fried green tomatoes my girl had the bourbon street pasta and we were both just blown by this food defiantly will be back"}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles I've had! Your missing the point if you don't order that when your here. Hidden between a row of buildings, this place is tightly squeezed into the cutest little cafe. Coming in, I was greeted right away and the waiter was patient with helping me decide what I wanted as a newcomer. Presentation was just as good looking as the food tasted. Chicken was made to perfection and the waffles were so soft I was so impressed. It also came with a side of grits, it was truly a great breakfast for a Saturday dinner ;) Not only is it a plus that its so close to me but its great to know such a great cafe is close by. Will try to bring my flock of breakfasters here next time!"}
{"text":"Small but quaint environment. Warm---even hot in the inside (no AC or if there was some it was minimal) but just as you expect from a soulful restaurant. The food was great. We all got something different but enjoy every meal."}
{"text":"Took my brother here who was in town. My first time as well. Pleasant enough service. We had the fried green tomatoes for starters which were very good! I had the blackened chicken breast/was juicy and good sides were macaroni and cheese/good and yams/which were REALLY good and corn muffin. Brother had I think the perch fish, macaroni and cheese and greens. He liked his meal too. (I think it should've came with tarter sauce but he didn't seem to mind or mention it.) We both had the grape/lemonade kool-aid, served in mason jars...really something basic yet taste oh so good! Total came to $38 (fair.) I will go back!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and grits and it was amazing. I didn't like that it was really hot in the restaurant but the excellent food made up for it."}
{"text":"Best iced tea I've ever had. Service was prompt. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. I liked my order, I'm no expert on southern food, so I can't really compare but I liked it.Our server was very friendly and welcoming.Heard they serve brunch as well-going back for that soon!"}
{"text":"Food is to die for - real, homestyle, southern comfort food. We got the chicken dinner and the perch dinner - both seasoned and cooked perfectly. The tartar sauce is SO good and we also loved the corn bread (not dry and crumbly like some) and the creamed corn. Probably one of the most delicious meals we have had in a while and the best part? The chef himself delivered the food to our house (super fast too!) and wouldn't take a tip - he said he just wanted us to enjoy our food! How cool is that?!?"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after I ran at a nearby 5k.  Just found it on Google.  Didn't know anything about it.  But got the chicken and the red velvet waffle.  I loved both.  I don't know if it's authentic it not.  That's not my forte but I did enjoy the food.  I would definitely consider coming back if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Easily in my top 5 restaurants in Lakewood.  Amazing food.  Some if the best shrimp and grits I've ever had, gumbo is right up there with with what NOLA offers.  And reasonably priced for the quality of food.  Definitely will keep going back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast and enjoyed the experience as a whole. Easy parking, friendly and quick service and quality food. Has a homey / family-owned feel which we liked. As an FYI they do not take cards."}
{"text":"Wow. This was our second choice for brunch in Lakewood. I'm so glad the other place had a line out the door so we were compelled to come here! My favorite thing was the \"Cleveland original soul rolls\", egg roll shells filled with chicken, greens, beans and cheese sauce. Seriously, try these! Everything else was delicious, artful soul food. The fried okra was perfectly prepared with a delightful crunch. The grits were creamy and wonderful, and I'll bet their shrimp and grits are amazing. Fried chicken and red velvet waffles were a big hit with the kids.  And that was just what we ordered.  The menu is chocked full of dishes I can't wait to try next time! The desserts especially.  Granted, I'm not from the South so I really shouldn't be talking about authenticity but I do appreciate the unique details. Like this is the first restaurant I've been in that served Cool Aide. And on the table is just hot sauce and syrup. Salt and pepper are completely irrelevant because nothing isn't savory and seasoned. I only have one very small caveat. I with they would serve real half and half not the those little shelf stable creamers."}
{"text":"I had the soul rolls, fried green tomatoes, and bread pudding. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. Their hot sauce is awesome. Tasted my husbands order of shrimp and grits -- it was great too. I loved the service and the meal, and can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.  Best Soul Food this side of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time, and I will for sure be going back. It's a very small and simple place. The food here is delicious and the staff is just as wonderful. It was very quick and friendly service. The fries were some of the best I've had around. One thing that caught my eye is they will deliver within a two mile radius for free on orders over $25."}
{"text":"From the outside this place does not look like much but once you step in, oh my!  The soul food here is excellent.  Service was fast and friendly.  A must stop."}
{"text":"The chicken was the highlight of the meal. The red velvet waffles were ok, though they tasted more like citrus than anything. The mac-n-cheese was horrendous; overcooked noodles, tossed with a sprinkling of shredded cheese. They were no longer offering fresh-cut fries, yet still charging full price for frozen crinkle cuts. And the kicker, the was a thick, black hair on my plate. Two stars were generously given for the chicken alone. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Super clean, super friendly, and the food was awesome. I like the menu, the perfect amount with not to many options. The kool aid drinks were the perfect touch to everything I had. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Really good, will be coming back! We had the soul rolls, must try! The chicken and fried green tomato blt was also very tasty! Great place that I wouldn't have eaten at without help from yelp. It's easy to pass up. Glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Some if the best soul food in Cleveland! Great, small, simple restaurant. Downside is that it is really hot inside, I do not think they have a/c. Our server was very friendly, answered all our questions and was very personable. Great menu and the food arrived very quickly.   We ordered the chicken & waffles. The chicken wings were enormous, juicy, crunchy and had great seasoning. The red velvet waffles were very yummy. They were cooked perfectly, crunchy exterior and soft interior. Also tried the catfish fingers, the cornmeal breading was nice and the fish was flakey and tender. For me it was just a little bit over salted. For our sides we ordered their mac n cheese which had great flavor, and also some of the cheese had crunchy parts which are always a winner! The grits were cooked perfectly, nice and creamy. And the collards tender, and had a nice kick. Don't let the unassuming exterior and the simplicity of the interior deter you, they are putting out some great food."}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to Lakewood. Good old American food that you never get tired of eating. Fried chicken , fried cabbage and house potatoes (potato gratin) are my husband's go-to meal. And the chicken wings called Wing-dings are plump, juicy , meaty and delicious. We got the barbecue Wing dings and they were great. Also the corn bread is the best ever- tastes light and home made. If they put some soups on the menu that would be my only suggestion."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding!  The shrimp and grits are phenomenal, buttery rich and creamy grits that aren't too heavy with a delicious and fresh sauce with just the right amount of spice to it. The fresh herbs really lift the sauce and the shrimp is cooked perfectly.   The chicken is another outstanding victory. Lightly fried with a light, crispy coating that compliments the soft chicken underneath.   The sides again are fantastic, our table had greens, Mac and cheese and candied yams.   Do not sleep on this place, this is the best soul food I've had to date."}
{"text":"I was actually looking for another restaurant when I stumbled on Southern Cafe. Thank God I did because the food was deliciousssss!  You receive decent amount of food for the price. Service was great... Will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got them from uber eats twice and both times super delicious and fresh. The bourbon street pasta is amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped here after showing up in town.  It was pretty good. Had a nice atmosphere and the food had flavor. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I actually really like the food here, but the service is a complete disaster. It's not a one time deal either. At least three occasions the wait time has been horrible. 15 mins at least before a drink order is taken."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a wonderful brunch here with my family. The red velvet waffles were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. I'm not a huge fan of grits, but I ate every last spoonful.  The food was served very hot. The service was gracious. The space is somewhat drab. The dishes are too small, or maybe the portions were too big. In any event it was delicious."}
{"text":"We are in town for the weekend and we decided to try this place! Everything was so good!! I don't think we've ever been to a restaurant where everything we got was right on point! They make their own salad dressings and everything and you could tell everything was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased with the entire experience at The Southern Cafe. Our server was very nice and helpful.  She was attentive during our entire dining experience.  I ordered the 2 piece chicken (white meat) with the macaroni & cheese and fried cabbage. The chicken was amazing.  I usually am disappointed with side dishes at restaurants, but I was pleasantly  surprised to enjoy my two choice sides and corn muffin.  I will be back again!! This is definitely the best place in Cleveland for soul food!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats! Don't tell my grandma but I think their shrimp and grits is better than hers!"}
{"text":"If you love salt,  your clothes smelling like fried food and being nickle and dimed,  then this place is for you. Meals and sides were wayyyyyy over salted.  Asked for BBQ sauce, was given some in a small 1 ounce container and was charged $. 50 on my bill. Clearly this is not about the amount,  but,  to even charge for a condiment?? Really?  Friend got the turkey \"chop\" which was no bigger than a chicken tender.  Nothing special here. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. Nyssa was friendly and helpful, breakfast was simple but distinctive and tasty. Will definitely go again. However, they do not carry decaf."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken and red velvet cake waffles!! Deliciously sweet kool-aid and buttery grits (simple but my favorite)"}
{"text":"Can't beat the shrimp & grits.  A generous portion for an appetizer.  Added fried okra for my complete meal.  Had peach cobbler to go.  Added ice cream.  Delicious. Service was very good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A hidden charm that you will likely drive by and never notice. The food is delicious, the prices are great, and the flavors are out of this world. I cannot recommend this place more.  Get the catfish, and the soul rolls are a must try"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I'm never disappointed. Best soul food on the west side. The Salisbury steak is wonderful and all the side dishes are great. A must try restaurant for good quality food."}
{"text":"Ok just had this amazing southern food I ordered around 9:30 had my food by 10:00.  Was hot and just delicious.  I ordered the turkey chops with rice and Mac and cheese.  My husband ordered  the 2 piece chicken dinner with the Mac n cheese and of course the soul rolls.     And once again he said you have to make these rolls.  Although he knows I have tried and failed miserably time after time. Best I can do is just pick up the phone and order some lol.   He lived his meal as well.   So glad they deliver.   Our new go to spot.  And the fast delivery.  Oh yes.  I urge everyone that loves southern cuisine and those that don't. To give it a try."}
{"text":"Tonight at Southern Cafe, they had a rough night. Several people had called off and the staff was stretched too thin. Despite the long wait for drink order and such, I still give this place five stars, because they handled themselves as best they could in the circumstances they found themselves. The food was amazing, possibly the best fried chicken I have ever had, and though we knew the manager, who was our server, was under a large amount of stress, she never let on. Definitely check this place out. Great food, and great people."}
{"text":"Enter at your OWN RISK... IT IS HOT AS F!CK INSIDE THIS RESTAURANT! THEY HAVE THE FRONT DOOR WIDE OPEN AND TOO MANY FLIES FOR ME AND THIS IS A RESTAURANT!!! Now to tell you all about my experience in this restaurant... I ordered my food...a perch dinner with fried okra and mac and cheese with a sunset kool aid. The server brought out my order and placed it at another persons table...the customer told him that it wasn't what he ordered but to put it at his table and he (the waiter) and customer KNEW it was NOT his meal. The waiter comes back out takes my meal, gives the other patron his meal. Proceedes to the back to come back out with my meal (which he just picked up from the other table) and my sisters. My sister and I both say that is the food he just took from the other table. The waiter says \"no they had another already made in the back\".....mind you everyone else had their food except my sister and I. How is it that you have the same exact meal prepared and waiting in the back?? Needless to say I will NOT be going back here on any circumstance."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!!  Breading on the catfish is perfect, light and just for flavor.  Shrimp and grits has a good sweet and spicy flavor that is not overpowering. Yummy"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were quite good. Chicken was gigantic--it barely fit on my plate! And I wasn't expecting much, but the waffles were the best I've had in recent memory.   Lastly, the lone server worked very hard to keep drinks filled and such.   Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and true Southern cooking. I have not had a bad meal there. Good portions and great price for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We ordered on uber eats! So good! Tried the chicken and waffles, shrimp n grits, fried green tomatoes and the peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Honestly the best grits I ever had. Lindy was so very helpful! 5 Stars!  I ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles, and it was stellar. Chicken was delicious af!"}
{"text":"The food and staff were wonderful! I highly recommend this restaurant. I had the Red Velvet Waffles and Chicken. The chicken was fried perfect and moist inside, and the waffles were an awesome compliment to the chicken. My wife had the Salisbury Steak and said it was the best she ever had!"}
{"text":"So...this place is the perfect mixture of southern food and modern flare. The food is delicious and the lortions are perfect. This is my new go to restaurant for when im on a cheat date, and starving."}
{"text":"OMG--soooo good! It tastes just like the food I grew up on.  I had fried green tomatoes and fried catfish strips for appetizers. The tomatoes were bland, but the catfish was on point.  For my entree, I had a smothered pork chop. It was kind of thin, but it was tender. I chose mac n cheese and collard greens for my sides. The greens practically melted in my mouth and were seasoned so well. The mac n cheese was real Southern mac and cheese--no frigging roux, just macaroni, cream, eggs, salt, pepper, and LOTS of cheese baked together. I got some peach cobbler for later.  I chose the basics to see if they were good. If they messed those up, there would be no hope for the rest of their food. They passed the test for me.  The dining room was casual but nice; a warm, inviting color on the walls, some artwork, and R&B music playing. There are four four-person tables and four two-person tables.  The service was a bit slow, but that's because they make the food when you order it. The server was very nice and attentive.  I want go back and have their buttermilk fried chicken and red velvet waffles. A guy across from me had them, and they looked amazing.  They also serve breakfast until 11 a.m.  I'd definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"I am from Georgia and I think the food here beat out some of my favorite restaurants in Georgia! The food was amazing! My husband ordered blackened catfish with creamed corn and candied yams and I ordered chicken and red velvet waffles with grits. WOW! Everything was delicious. Chicken was crunchy on the outside but nice and tender on the inside. Grits were probably my favorite thing, if I had to choose. Creamy, buttery, and salty! Just like southern grits should be. Everything tasted like home. We will most definitely be back! I'm sure I'll be craving their food. Service was top notch. Our water glasses were always full, food came out fast and hot, and server knew when to come by to ask if we needed anything else. A must go place here in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This review is probably going to cause a riot because I really don't understand how there are so many glowing 5 star reviews. Or I am just being a curmudgeon today. Regardless, let's get down to business.  The inside is clean and gives off this homey vibe (inviting and comfortable). The wait staff comes across as pleasant, polite, and attentive. This place is pretty new so there are some kinks to work out, for instance it took 3 bills before I was charged the correct amount, food quality needs to improve, and kitchen staff needs to be more mindful of mixing up orders.  -BLT $6: This is made with a fried green tomato, but only one slice so I traded the side of fries for an extra fried green tomato slice. I did really enjoy this, but hope they make two slices of tomato a standard on future BLT sandwiches.  -Veggie Plate $10: You get to pick any 3 sides and it comes with a mini corn bread muffin (meh okay). I chose coleslaw, the cajun corn and the mac & cheese. Very disappointing. The coleslaw is just the regular plain stuff, the cajun corn was so packed with salt that it was inedible, the mac & cheese is like the dried noodle/curdled cheese, lackluster stuff you find at the bottom of a crock pot at a family picnic you didn't want to be at.  -Fried Chicken Wings $?: These still had a lot of of feather bits on them and the meat was still pink inside. No thank you. (I don't even know how they ended up in my order.) -Bread Pudding $4: (Initially missing from my order.) This was not bad at all and they give you a pretty decent sized portion so it is perfect to split if you don't want to go into a carb induced coma.   Overall I'd give this place 2.5 stars. They seem like they have some potential but like the rating states: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I'd give them another shot in a couple months and update my review accordingly. Please don't send me hate mail."}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a southern meal. I couldn't believe how good it was.  I had chicken and waffles dinner meal and my friend had the Salisbury steak with mac and cheese and collar greens.  We both were impressed and it was like we having an authentic southern meal back home in Wilmington, NC. My chicken was cooked perfectly with a crispy outside and a very juicy inside breast. It was so good I also came to tears.   Don't miss out on this gem!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our first ( and last!) Visit. Started with call we got put on hold. After 5 minutes hung up and called back several times and the line was busy. Stopped in to place the order. There were only two tables with people dining. The girl apologized and had some excuse for why their phone was still busy. On to the food. Terrible. Makes no sense the chicken was obviously not cooked to order. It was so dry and all bones no meat. Sadly KFC is better if you are looking for fried chicken. The seafood pasta had overcooked shrimp. The girl gave us a complimentary dessert for our trouble recommending the peach cobbler. So bad it was canned peaches.  With all the great past reviews obviously something has changed recently. Paying $15 for overcooked 2 pieces of chicken and waffles that were cold is so wrong. And even though their menu says fresh cut fries they switched to frozen crinkle cut. And the syrup comes in little packets from a distributor. It's sad when restaurants start cutting corners because that means something is wrong. I hope they can right the situation or they may not be around later."}
{"text":"Oh wow. This place is awesome. Very reasonable. But the food is heaven. I didn't even know this place was here. You will not be disappointed.  Everything seemed to have a little kick, a lot of flavor and service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Very fast service , good was out and super fresh. Everything was amazing and good. I'm glad they put a soul food place in Lakewood it was well needed"}
{"text":"OverPriced: $15 for 4 pieces 2 sides & gimmicky purple Kool Aide. OverCooked: Dry hard overly peppered breading with dry meat underneath. Undersized chicken legs thighs & wings (think kfc) Flavorless Mac & Cheese & Fried Cabbage. Put me in the right mood & I can make this same meal better at home. My staycation visit from the east side was not worth the drive."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Alfredo and it was just delicious and the soul rolls are a must have great food!!!"}
{"text":"The service person was very friendly , fast and respectful . We ordered to go. I like the menu selections . The restaurant is simple but not very warm .  I ordered wing dings and they tasted like they had been fried in fish batter. So edible I could not eat them. The mac and cheese lacked flavor and I could not eat that as well."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Sides are delicious and huge. Chix and waffles are the bomb. Perch is great. Overall really great. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Southern Cafe last Saturday.  The food was terrific and service very attentive.  Best southern cooking in Cleveland.  Wouldn't know they have just been open just a couple of weeks.Fried chicken was best I've had, and the leg was almost the size of a turkey! Also had the red beans and rice, collards, fried green tomatoes and gumbo - all well seasoned and big portions.  Prices were also very reasonable - fried chicken leg, corn bread and 2 sides for 8 bucks.   This will be on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not outstanding, but ok.  We came for breakfast during the week.   It's Lakewood, so street parking.   Upon walking in, I felt a bit awkward, like, are they even open.  It seemed a little dark inside (kinda grey day outside), but it just didn't seem like adequate lighting or something.  No one was eating there at the time, and the staff was all in the back.  Very small inside. Basically you walk in and there are a few tables down the left side and down the right.  I think what was different, is that there is no \"hostess\" stand or anything. I guess there is nothing wrong w/not having that, just seems weird to walk in and no one is there to greet you.    The waitress did come out from the back within seconds of us coming in, and she was pleasant.    The coffee is good.  It's served in a glass jar w/a handle which is different, but worked.   The menu was limited. One of us got a breakfast sandwich, and I got the fried chicken that came with 4 cute red velvet waffles & grits.  My friend said her b-fast sandwich was good, she especially liked the remoulade sauce they put on it.  My friend ate my grits (I'm not into that, it's a texture thing), and she said they were really good.  My red velvet waffles were tasty.  The waitress brings out syrup, which I tried and it was fine, but really the waffles were good plain!  The fried chicken wings were good as far as taste goes, however, they were a tad over done and yet they were kinda cold when I got them, not sure if they did those first and then the waffles, but hopefully they get timing down better.  As far as the wings, you get 2 and they aren't tiny, but they weren't huge either, and I was wishing I had at least one more.   The waitress brings you hot sauce as well, and yes that made the wings even better.    Will I be back? Yes."}
{"text":"was not pleased in the slightest. i ordered the catfish with greens and mac n cheese. the greens were bland and not fully cooked, mac n cheese was definitely not fresh and the catfish was cold. not to mention the \"corn bread \" that was with the dish was completely black on the bottom. burnt beyond saving let alone serving. no we ordered and had it delivered which is why it didn't get sent back immediately telling them no thank you. but that was $40 in the can , literally"}
{"text":"Southern Cafe is a very nice addition to Lakewood. Great food and friendly service. When you walk in, the hostess greets you with \"sit wherever you feel comfortable.\" The menu is vast and filled with everything you'd expect in a southern cafe. I had to try the chicken and red velvet waffles. My wife had the fried green tomato sandwich. Really enjoyed the food but even more excited about the inviting atmosphere. Had conversations with three different patrons sitting near us. How often does that happen? Almost never. And like many Lakewood businesses, it's a place where people of many cultures, races and creeds congregate together to break bread, but in this case, cornbread. Many things on the menu I must try. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Simple but good quality! I had the chicken and waffles with grits. Good addition to Lakewood Ohio"}
{"text":"This place was really great! The service was awesome. Very friendly and fast. The food was really good and fresh. The sweet tea was really good too. It's nice to have something different like this in the area. Glad to support a small business. And it was all very reasonably priced!!!"}
{"text":"This Foooood!!! My gentleman and I frequent this restaurant and It has become one of our favorites no matter what day of the week--except Monday when they are closed.  The food is always served up hot, fresh and fast. Everyone we've encountered was very friendly and attentive.  The owners are two of the nicest business individuals I've met in a long time.  I recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE who wants a delicious, hot, moderately priced meal in a warm and friendly environment.   WESTSIDE JEWEL!!  We've tried Grilled Chops, Greens, Fried Green Tomatoes, Fried Cabbage, Fried Chicken, Cajun Corn, Mac N Cheese, Shrimp N Grits, Catfish, Catfish Fingers, Pancakes, Soul Rolls, Low Grits, Sausage, Bacon and eggs!  All these items were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, excellent service by Dominic, fantastic food! We had the catfish and the pork chops both were perfectly seasoned. Our sides were collard greens French fries, house potatoes which I should have took to my house and the fried okra. We began with the soul rolls which definitely warmed our soul. What a great find in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"I love eating here! Some of the same  appetizers as Zanzibar. I love the shrimp and chicken Alfredo. Creamy, savory, and a slight kick of spice. I'm always getting the sides. The breakfast isn't too bad. The peach cobbler is good and of course the kool aid. I love the fact that they deliver or you can get delivery via UberEATS. I just wish they had the option of regular waffles with the chicken and waffles (not always in the mood for red velvet)."}
{"text":"The food, service, and overall atmosphere is awesome! The staff is always friendly (shout out to Ingrid and Cynthia!!) The chef puts so much love into his cooking. I have been here a lot since they opened. Highly recommend the Soul Rolls as an appetizer and the fried chicken with candied yams and mac'n cheese. Dude. So good."}
{"text":"My 3 friends and I came in on a Saturday morning and had Nyssa as our server. She was very attentive and fun and provided us with amazing service! We ordered 3 appetizers for the table: the catfish fingers, soul rolls, and the fried green tomatoes. All were great and came out very hot! For entrees we ordered the fried chicken, catfish, and friend pork chop-- no complaints with the entrees at all! The sides are for sure what makes the meal, though; we loved the house potatoes, Mac and cheese, fried okra, and red beans and rice. We are all very excited to return! Way to go Nyssa and the rest of the Southern Cafe team-- this restaurant is a gem!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at the Southern Cafe on a few occasions. Not only is the food amazing (the blackened chicken and fried green tomatoes are must-tries), but the service is impeccable. My server Nyssa not only made sure that my drink was always refilled, but she routinely checked-in on me to see how my experience was. Needless to say, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service for a family of 10.    Not a fan of the chicken and waffles but the cat fish was amazing / mac & cheese / chicken wings and house potatoes were unreal. Would definitely return"}
{"text":"So thankful this gem is in Lakewood. Stopped in for lunch today and it was phenomenal from the beginning. A warm welcome made me feel like I was having lunch with close friends and family and not just a patron at a restaurant. Marco was the best server! So friendly, informative and just great to talk to.  1.) Red kool aid on the menu. They have a decent array of flavors. This alone made me feel like a kid again 2.) All of the food is made from scratch and you can tell it's made with love. The only ingredients that come from a can or jar is the hot sauce (they want to start making their own soon) and syrup 3.) The fried green tomatoes are just like mom's! 4.) Mac and cheese, collard greens, fried okra and red beans and rice are perfect 5.) Fried chicken and catfish is like magic. 6.) Fried foods that aren't greasy AT ALL. Seriously. Overall great experience. You'd think your mom was in that kitchen cooking everything for you. Can't wait to go back and try more"}
{"text":"Went with two friends for the first time this evening after seeing the restaurant listed in Yelp.  Chose it partially because of location and partially because of the cuisine.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is clean with simple yet tasteful decor.  The seating area is on the smaller side but take out is available.  It is clearly a family run business with the personal and loving touch only a family business can have.  The food was delicious.  Between the three of us we had fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits, and soul rolls for appetizers.  For the entree two of us had the perch dinner and one had Bourbon Street pasta. The dessert of the night was peach cobbler which two of us ordered and shared among us.  We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered and took home leftovers because the portions were plentiful.  The service was very good.  We will definitely return and I have other people in mind I would like to take there as well."}
{"text":"We loved the Reuben Sandwiches! Very fresh, stacked high corned beef. So juicy & tasty!"}
{"text":"Will be awesome as soon as the kinks of opening a new restaurant are worked out. Ordered the blackened chicken sandwich and it was quite tasty. My guy had the cornmeal catfish and loved every bite. To my own surprise, the Mac n cheese was reminiscent of my mom's! Gooey and cheesey and perfect. Cajun creamed corn was a great twist on a classic! Loved the southern sweet tea. Definitely don't pass up on the Carmel crunch cake if it's fresh, it's unbelievably yummy! Can't wait to go back, hopefully next time there will be more than one server during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Delicious. Best grits in Cleveland. Decor is nothing fancy but the food was great, the service friendly and the price was right. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Red Velvet Waffles were so good! The waffles were nice and crispy on the outside but warm and fluffy on the inside. The chicken was slightly too fried and was a bit dry though. Ordered the soul rolls and they were also awesome. Just enough kick for me, even though I don't eat very spicy. And the catfish entree was also fantastic. Fried just enough and not too much or too little breading. The fish was beautifully flaky and not dry at all."}
{"text":"Had a craving for chicken and waffles and this place was the closest to my home at an affordable price.  First walked in and was shocked to learn that it is a cash only establishment.  There is an ATM available but of course you get charged a fee twice for using it. Am I'm expected to leave a tip in addition to those charges?! If I knew that ahead of time I probably would have went somewhere else.  The interior is very basic and I noticed that the flooring is chipped up pretty good.  Place was empty when I first arrived with my son but then other customers started coming in.  The waitress was nice enough and I ended up leaving a tip afterall.  Kitchen staff was walking around alot and they pretty much ignored the diners.  As for the food - had the red velvet waffles and chicken.  In my opinion, the chicken was pretty good, but I did not care for the waffles.  The middle of the waffles had a soggy /slimy texture.  Plate came with a side of grits which I normally am not a fan of but it was just ok.  My son however had the very same meal and he loved everything except for the grits.  He also had their Jolly Rancher Kool-Aid which he loved.  I tried it and thought it was entirely too sweet.  In conclusion, I would not be in a hurry to come back to this place and wouldn't recommend it.  In Lakewood, there is plenty of other restaurants with decent prices, better food, that also accepts credit cards. I'd pass on the Southern Cafe."}
{"text":"I had the soul rolls, catfish dinner with Cajun corn and candied yams. Everything was awesome!! The wife even shared her fried chicken with me and I was very impressed with it too. My new goal in life is to try everything on the menu!! If you get a chance to eat here, do it!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious and satisfying lunch at Southern Cafe! Would recommend to anyone who is craving some delicious southern comfort food. When you go, request Nyssa as your server! She not only was a fantastic server but she made the experience that much better! Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I'll always be biased towards breakfast food and southern cuisine, so I was impressed with what was going on here. The menu seemed simple enough and hassle-free, but after much deliberation I ordered the red velvet waffles with the side of bacon. Yes they were just as tasty as you can imagine. It's not the most generous of portions, but for the price it was certainly reasonable. Friendly servers and intimate interior make for a great brunch atmosphere. A stunning surprise was despite the laid back charm of the place, it was also more tech oriented in detail as the servers placed orders and took payment on tablets. Very nice!"}
{"text":"I ordered the biscuit's and gravy which comes 2 eggs and home fries ( mix of sweet and white potatoes) for $8. Loved it. Will definitely be back for that and to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Wasn't too sure about this place, but a friend picked (and was driving) so I didn't have much choice. I was very glad that I ended up there.   The decor of the venue wasn't that great; the waitress was very nice and gave us ample time to look over the surprisingly large menu.   After numerous flipping of the menu I settled on the pancakes, which were amazing.  I went extremely cautious as I really wasn't sure how the food would be and thought it would be very hard to screw up plain old pancakes. They were not only good, they were probably my favorite pancakes in the city! Perfect mix of lightly crispy edges with a nice warm/soft bite.   It's too bad they don't go the extra step of making their own orange juice (gross Tropicana in a tiny bottle), and their breakfast side meats are not local/made fresh.   My friend was way more adventurous than me and went with the fried chicken and velvet waffles. I took a bite of the waffles which were also very lovely.   All in all, I'd say if you're in the mood for some great breakfast food and don't mind losing your mind with all of the construction going on in Lakewood check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. The best food I've ever had on the west side the best service I've ever had. This without a doubt is my new wow. I can eat this everyday!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! I got the chicken and waffles the chicken was so moist and the red velvet waffles had a hint of cinnamon that made them so delicious. I also got the fried catfish fingers which were very light and great seasoning. Very large portions and a even better prices! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We visited tonight for dinner after finding the restaurant here on Yelp. All those 5 reviews were 100% warranted! I am from Arkansas and a fried chicken connoisseur. This was the best fried chicken I've had at a restaurant since Gladys & Ron's left the DMV. This wasn't \"elevated\" (or gentrified) fried chicken. This was perfectly juicy, perfectly crispy, perfectly seasoned fried chicken like your down south grandma and aunties make. These folks are so good in the kitchen they make MEATLESS collard greens perfection. And, everything is made from scratch! The prices are, frankly, super low for the amount and quality of food provided.   The catfish nuggets were also perfect, and my hubby's eyes may have rolled back in his head on his first spoonful of creamy, gooey grits.   In case it's not clear, we loved it here! We will definitely visit again the next time we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Really good both times we came for brunch. Southern veggie omelet and omelet sandwich, southern gravy and biscuits and Cajun potatoes were stand outs. Friendly staff. Small space with good music playing."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start my review off just saying this is not a real big restaurant so the four or five times I've ate here it was to go . Wow what a scrumptious place to eat . They are closed on Mondays but you have 6 other days to get your but up there and try it . The grits are one of my favorite, the soul rolls , and the greens . The Mac and cheese is great , my favorite the fried chicken dark . Prices are excellent, and it's the only soul food restaurant on the west side of Cleveland just a couple blocks into Lakewood! Kudos Southern Cafe!!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for soul food. Fried chicken, collard greens, Mac and cheese, hospitality, you name it and I'm there. That's exactly what Southern Cafe is. Very unassuming, delicious, comfort food. The fried chicken and accompanying sides were all fantastic. The breading was flavorful, crispy, and meat was juicy. The collard greens had that \"all day with ham hocks\" flavor. The mac and cheese was moist, cheesy, and worked well with their hot sauce. Will definitely be back again for the Chicken and Red Velvet waffles!"}
{"text":"This place is very, very good.    My husband I frequented this place this weekend.   It is small, but modern and nice.   Service was great, and I assume it is a child of workers who help out as well.   This seems to be a family place.      The food is outstanding for the most part.   My husband's catfish was amazing.... I got turkey which was good as well.    The grits were perfect.... Which is very rare.    This is more of a deep south food as the greens were sweeter and less vinegar....   The Mac and cheese was OK, not as great as everything else.     We will be back...."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. I am visiting from another city and went to this place for lunch. The food was great, the place is clean, the server Cynthia was very nice, and overall the vibe was great.  I had the sweet tea, the mac n cheese, the fried cabbage, the catfish fingers, and the shrimp n grits. Each and every thing I had was amazing and reasonably priced. The mac was *real* mac-- baked, with some brown, very cheesy-- just like it's supposed to be. The fried cabbage was amazingly flavorful. The catfish fingers were phenomenal-- they had a great flavor, were fried just right (not too hard), and the sauce that came with them has a bit of spice and great flavor, some of the best I've ever had. The shrimp and grits was more a meal than an appetizer. The shrimp was very tasty, the sauce was great, everything was soupy and flavorful, just like it should be.  Cynthia, the server, was great. She was friendly and on the ball, refilling my tea without my even having to ask. I also found it helpful that the place uses a tablet (kind like Square) for payment so I could sign with my finger and have my receipt printed or emailed or texted to me.  I left this place very satisfied and very full. Others in the restaurant enjoyed themselves too-- one guy ordered more food to go, including four peach cobblers! One of the owners came in while I was there and received compliments from folks sitting down.  This place was great... I may just go back. And if you haven't been, slide over to Detroit Avenue and stop in. Go on... doooooo iiiiiiittttt!"}
{"text":"Holy bologna, guys, this place is the tits.  I had the veggie omelette sandwich and my boyfriend had the soulful breakfast--both were mind numbingly good.  I switched out normal potatoes for candied yams on the side...I wish I could eat those yams every day.  Big portions and friendly, laid-back service.  If I could give this place 10 stars instead of 5, I would."}
{"text":"Chicken was awesome, as was the creamed corn. No a.c. which sucked, and no liquor license, but definitely going back to this little soul food dive."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My husband got the catfish, fried okra, and grits and I got the fried chicken with collard greens and red beans and rice. For an appetizer we got the fried green tomatoes. Everything tasted wonderful and we were stuffed when we left. The food had some heat to it but not to the point where you can't taste what your eating. We had a wonderful and very attentive waitress named Sofia and it was some of the best service we've had in a long time. The atmosphere was very cozy and I can't wait to eat there when it snowing outside and we can look out the window while enjoying some comfort food. I would definitely recommend his place to others."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Ordered my food take out at about 730pm. Girl over the phone was still very nice, considering they closed at 8pm.  got the large catfish dinner (2 pieces), with Mac and cheese, collard greens, and a corn muffin. Fish was seasoned to perfection, not too soft or crunchy perfect texture. Impressed with the collard greens also; sort of sweet and spicy if you like greens that way. Mac and cheese was cheesy but could've used a touch more seasoning. All in all, a great first time. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend it to someone who needs their soul food fix or wants to try it for the first time."}
{"text":"The selections available on the menu are delightfully varied. I ordered the soul rolls plus the fried pork chops with collard greens and macaroni and cheese.   My server, Dylan, was pleasant and helpful enough, although they could not accommodate my sampling the peach cobbler.  Additionally, I overheard Dylan telling another customer that the Groupon coupon the customer wanted to use was not valid, because it was for two entrees only, even though they both agreed   Unfortunately, the food was underwhelming.  While the rolls were pretty tasty, the pork chops, greens and macaroni and cheese were not seasoned with enough salt and pepper.  On the other hand, the gravy was too salty, so in this case the balance was good.   I might however, be a little picky with this type of food, because I make exceptionally good pork chops, collard greens and Mac & cheese - so I acknowledge very strong criteria may have been applied here.."}
{"text":"One word.   Awesome.  Great food. Large portions. I'm home for the weekend.  I'll def. eat here again.  Friendly people and owner."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffles were great, chicken wings were young chicken which when fried forms dark marks on the bones and outside of the chicken. Wings french toast was great, grits were great. Make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I had the fried chicken with candied yams and mac n cheese. I've never had candied yams before, and after this experience I think yams should always be candied.   If you're looking for starters I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes and the catfish fingers. Both were delicious and the remoulade to dip was to die for.   Dylan, our server, was excellent. He was friendly, prompt, and gave us our space to enjoy our meal and company.   I will be coming back here to try more of the food!"}
{"text":"What a cool place ! We found it all thanks to Yelp! The food was so good,very unique... and delicious! I would definitely recommend! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"First time in Ohio and found this restaurant on google!!! The customer service from Lindy was amazing!!! She recommended food options and made sure to even up sell us on some amazing soul rolls!!! AMAZING!!! This restaurant was good all around, but my favorites are #1 the Mac and cheese, #2 The bomb wings, and #3 The Perch!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"A small establishment that can fill up quick. The food was good and desert to die for (peach cobbler), the service was superb. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others and I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Food was awesome ! Our server Lonnie was awesome! Always kept our glasses full and tables looking great! Quick service good atmosphere !!!"}
{"text":"First off,  try the soul rolls,  secondly try anything else on the menu!  So darn good.  I had the cat fish (fried)  and it was cooks perfect. Crunchy not hard or burnt,  airy and all around yummy. The Salisbury steak moist and tender. Smothered pork chop divine. The actual store front can use a pick me up. But it didn't change my thoughts of the food"}
