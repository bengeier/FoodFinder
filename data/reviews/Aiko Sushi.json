{"text":"Okay makis, soy sauce is way too sweet and it's very expensive for what you get. Also they charge extra to give you more ginger."}
{"text":"ordered from this place, good fish, quick, miam"}
{"text":"Ordered from here at least 10 or 12 times and only once was it a little underwhelming... Every other time, the sushi has been absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend the Nizakama, it's by far my favorite. I haven't found any other sushi I've liked as much as what I've had from Aiko."}
{"text":"one word, it s not good, it's not sushis! 
I can cook better sushis by myself!"}
{"text":"If you don't know what you want to eat. Aiko has ready made sushi 10-15$ prepared for you. Quick and easy."}
{"text":"Used to be on my top of the list in the neighborhood; good price, fresh ingredients and lots of fish, no more. Please do not cheat on the amount of fish in order to keep the same price, I'd rather pay $0.50 more to get the quality I used to get."}
{"text":"Ordered from JustEat.ca because why go outside?! :P

Took a very long time to arrive on a Wednesday evening, and went past the expected delivery time.

The sushi is OK but you can find much better elsewhere. 

Very little fish in the kamikazi roll, agedashi tofu wasn't what I expect from agedashi tofu. (over deep fried firm tofu instead of deep fried silken) Just kind of came off rubbery.

The rice isn't prepared too well either, slightly overcooked and not seasoned as well. 

I had cash in hand to tip the driver, but right after I opened the door before he even HANDED me my food he asked where his tip was on the receipt. 

Remember folks, tipping isn't mandatory, so please don't ask me where your tip is before you even do the thing you're getting tipped for."}
{"text":"Old fish = sick. 

Can someone explain this to the people here? Please. Twice this horrible pain and bloating within 30 minutes of lunch. Twice. Run for your life!"}
{"text":"Best sushi delivery service. We got quite a lot and everything was good. The musts are by far the tartare makis of salmon and tuna. The kamikaze with tuna and they also made it of salmon on request. The spicy shrimp and the snow crab roll was also very good. Salmon and tuna Nigiris and rising sun. We also got a free dragon eye with the order. I never ate there but the delivery service is amazing if you have a nice patio to enjoy a great view with a good wine."}
{"text":"Jai donné la chance A ce restaurant twice, infiniment regrettable, plus jamais. Service de livraison pourri, 1h minimum, ça arrive froid en plus. alors oublie la pizza sushis et les sushis frits elles n'arrivent jamais chaude comme prévu . Pour le reste ça manque de fraîcheur de savoir faire, en prenant Ca avec les baguettes, les sushis commencent à se défaire tout seul. Parlant de peux cest pas donnée. Je n'ai pas de problème à payer le prix so cest bon et bien servis. 
Alors pour moi je ne réfère pas ce restau."}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité prix. Je commande puis vais les chercher pret en 20 min. Sushis offert à partir de 15$. Je vous le conseil"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs sushis à se faire livrer à Montréal. Les saveurs sont vraiment originales. Chaque maki (ou presque) vient accompagné de sa sauce. Essayez le spécial Aiko, le rouleau curry aux crevettes et les makis-tartares au saumon. À noter aussi : des makis gratuits lorsqu'on atteint un certain montant. Prévoir jusqu'à 45 minutes à 1h pour la livraison."}
