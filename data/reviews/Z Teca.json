I was there for lunch in two different locations and they told how badly they being treated.

For $11, you'd expect a decent sized burrito bowl. Instead, customers get a bowl that is skimp on rice (where you can still see the bottom), a measly scoop of meat, pico de gallo, corn, and beans. The food tasted alright but was not flavourable or memorable. 

Service was fast as another Yelper noted but I'd recommend spending your dollars elsewhere if you're looking for a decent Mexican option."}
